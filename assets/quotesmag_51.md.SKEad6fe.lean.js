It is measured using an electrocardiogram (ECG). Normally, this begins at the sinoatrial node (SA node); from here the wave of depolarisation travels down to the apex of the heart. The hexaxial reference system can be used to visualise the directions in which the depolarisation wave may travel. On a hexaxial diagram (see figure 1): * If the electrical axis falls between the values of -30° to +90° this is considered normal. * If the electrical axis is between -30° to -90° this is considered left axis deviation. * If the electrical axis is between +90° to +180° this is considered right axis deviation (RAD). RAD is an ECG finding that arises either as an anatomically normal variant or an indicator of underlying pathology.  Signs, symptoms and risk factors  There are often no symptoms for RAD and it is usually found by chance during an ECG. Many of the symptoms exhibited by patients with RAD are associated with its different causes. The table below displays the four most common causes and the signs, symptoms and risk factors associated with it. {  ! href=\\"electrocardiography\\"  !Signs and symptoms ! href=\\"heart disease\\" Risk factors - href=\\"electrical conduction\\"  href=\\"Electrocardiogram#Axis\\" Lateral myocardial infarction Anxiety Chest pain Fatigue Shortness of breath Smoking or Tobacco Obesity Gender Hypertension Diabetes Physical activity Age Alcohol -  href=\\"left posterior fascicular block\\" Right ventricular hypertrophy  href=\\"Apex of the heart\\" Shortness of breath Dizziness Fainting Chronic lung disease (COPD) Pulmonary hypertension Mitral stenosis Pulmonary embolism Congenital heart disease Arrythmogenic right ventricle cardiomyopathy -  href=\\"Left axis deviation\\" Fascicular Block  href=\\"Category:Heart diseases\\" Light-headedness Fainting Palpitations Hereditary bundle branch block - href=\\"Category:All stub articles\\"Pre-excitation Syndromes Pre- excitation syndrome Asymptomatic Wolff-Parkinson-White - Other causes Variable Ectopic ventricular beats Drug toxicity (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants) Hyperkalaemia } Causes Fascicular block Blockage of the left posterior fascicle would lead to activation of the anterior portion of the left ventricle followed by activation of the rest of the ventricle in a superior to inferior direction and directed towards the right. This would lead to right axis deviation findings on an ECG. Bifascicular block is a combination of right bundle branch block and either left anterior fascicular block or left posterior fascicular block. Conduction to the ventricle would therefore be via the remaining fascicle. The ECG will show typical features of RBBB plus either left or right axis deviation. Lateral myocardial infarction The lateral wall of the left ventricle is supplied by branches of the left anterior descending (LAD) and left circumflex (LCx) arteries. Infarction of the lateral wall will thus lead to deviation of the axis away from the site of infarction. Right ventricular hypertrophy Increased thickness of the right ventricle leads to right axis deviation (see above). Pre-excitation syndromes Pre-excitation refers to early activation of the ventricles due to impulses bypassing the AV node via an accessory pathway. Accessory pathways are abnormal conduction pathways formed during cardiac development. An example of pre-excitation syndromes is Wolff Parkinson White syndrome. Here, the presence of a left lateral accessory pathway leads to right-axis deviation. Ventricular tachycardia Fascicular tachycardia usually arises from the posterior fascicle of the left bundle branch. They produce QRS complexes of relatively short durations with a right bundle branch block pattern. Tachycardias originating in the anterior left fascicle would lead to right axis deviation. Right ventricular outflow tract tachycardia originates from the outflow tract of the right ventricle or the tricuspid annulus. As it arises from the right ventricle, the impulse spreads inferiorly from beneath the pulmonary valve, and there right axis deviation. Ventricular ectopy Ventricular ectopy is when the heartbeat is an abnormal heartbeat where the QRS complex is significantly wider. When the origin of the ectopic heartbeat is in the anterior fascicule then there is right axis deviation.  Pathophysiology  The pathophysiology depends on the specific cause of right axis deviation. Most causes can be attributed to one of four main mechanisms. These include right ventricular hypertrophy, reduced muscle mass of left ventricle, altered conduction pathways and change in the position of the heart in the chest. Right ventricular hypertrophy Enlargement of right ventricular myocardial mass can result in right axis deviation. There are 2 main reasons for this mechanism. Firstly, more muscle mass will result in greater amplitude of depolarisation of that side of the heart. Secondly, depolarisation of the heart will be slower through the right ventricle relative to the left, and therefore the effects of the right ventricle on the axis of the heart will be dominant. Left ventricular atrophy Decrease in myocardial mass of the left ventricle will shift the balance of depolarisation towards the right. For example, scarring and atrophy caused by ischaemia of the left ventricle will cause depolarisation of the left side of the heart to be less forceful. Hence, depolarisation of the right ventricle will be greater in amplitude than left, shifting the axis to the right. Conduction abnormalities Changes in the conduction pathways of the heart can result in right axis deviation. For example, an accessory pathway from the left atrium to the left ventricle, as in Wolff-Parkinson- White Syndrome, will result in the left ventricle finishing depolarisation earlier than the right. Hence, the right ventricle will have more of an effect on the axis of the heart. Position of heart in the chest The apex of the heart is normally orientated towards the left. A more vertical orientation of the heart, shifts the axis to the right. Physiologically, this can occur in tall and thin individuals. Pathologically, conditions such as a left-sided pneumothorax and lung hyperinflation (e.g. COPD) can cause rightwards displacement of the heart. The congenital condition of dextrocardia results in right axis deviation. Diagnosis ECG showing right axis deviation In general, a positive (upwards) deflection of an ECG trace demonstrates an electrical activity which moves towards the measuring electrode, whereas a negative (downwards) deflection of an ECG trace demonstrates an electrical activity which moves away from the measuring electrode. The electrical heart axis can be estimated from the ECG by using the quadrant method or degree method. #Quadrant Method: Leads I and II are usually observed. If lead I is positive (translating to 0° on the hexaxial reference system) and lead II is positive (translating to 60°), the electrical heart axis is estimated to fall in the left lower quadrant within the normal range. On the other hand, as shown in Figure 2, if lead I is negative (translating to 180°) and lead II is positive, the electrical heart axis is estimated to fall in the right lower quadrant suggesting a right axis deviation. Similarly, leads I and aVF can be used. #Degree method: First, identify the lead with the smallest QRS complex or isoelectric (flat) QRS complex (lead a). After locating the axis of the lead on the hexaxial reference system, identify the lead which is perpendicular to it (lead b). If lead b is positive, the electrical heart axis can be estimated to lie within the quadrant between axis of lead a and lead b. A simple tool to quickly identify axis deviation (Figure 3) is the popular mnemonic; Reaching for Right Axis Deviation and Leaving for Left Axis Deviation. This refers to the appearance of leads I and III. If the QRS complex is negative in lead I and positive in lead III, the QRS complexes appear to be \\"reaching\\" to touch each other. This signifies right axis deviation. Conversely, if the QRS complex is positive in lead I and negative in lead III. the leads have the appearance of \\"leaving\\" each other. If the QRS complex in lead II is also negative, this confirms a left axis deviation.

It is endemic to the southeastern United States. Its natural habitats are temperate rivers, swamps, freshwater lakes and freshwater marshes. It is threatened by habitat loss. Taxonomy Historically, the river frog has been known as Rana heckscheri but was placed in the genus Lithobates by Frost et al., 2006, this being a separate genus of ranid frogs that included most of the North American frogs traditionally included in the genus Rana. This change has proved controversial, and some authorities treat Lithobates as a subgenus of Rana, with the river frog's scientific name being written Rana (Lithobates) heckscheri. Description The river frog is a large species with adults commonly between in length. The skin is rough and wrinkled but there are no dorso-lateral ridges as there are in the green frog (Lithobates clamitans). The back is some shade of dark green or blackish-green and the belly is dark grey, or blackish with pale wavy lines and specks. A distinctive characteristic is white spots on the lips, particularly on the lower lip, and this helps to distinguish this species from bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana) and pig frogs (Rana grylio). Another distinguishing feature is a pale band outlining the groin. Males have a yellowish throat and their tympani (eardrums) are larger than their eyes while those of females are smaller. Distribution and habitat The river frog is endemic to the Atlantic and Gulf coastal plains of the southeastern United States. Its range extends southwards from the southern part of North Carolina to southeastern Mississippi and northern Florida. Its typical habitat is marshes and other wet locations with emergent vegetation near streams, rivers, ponds and lakes. Biology Adult river frogs have a home range of about . They are largely nocturnal and feed on insects and other invertebrates, as well as small vertebrates, including frogs. They spend much of their time in water and are relatively bold. During hot weather they are normally found sitting in moist or wet places, presumably to avoid desiccation. When the temperature falls below about they are no longer to be seen in their normal habitat and are likely to be seeking refuge from the cold under water. Tadpoles have red eyes and dark edges to the tail fin Breeding takes place between April and August with males calling from the edge of ponds and swamps from April to July. The call has been described as \\"a deep, low-pitched, rolling snore\\". The eggs are laid in a floating layer among emergent vegetation, a clutch numbering several thousand eggs which hatch after about three days. The tadpoles are at first a dark color but become much paler over time with a dark edge to the tail fin. They congregate in the shallows in the daytime, sometimes in dense swarms, but move into deep water at night. They feed on both animal and vegetable matter. They remain as tadpoles for a long period, overwintering once or twice, and reaching a snout-to-vent length of or more. After metamorphosis, the newly emerged juveniles are long and move away from the margins of the water. The large number of juveniles compared to the relatively small number of adults indicates a high mortality rate for newly emerged young. Predators that feed on tadpoles and juveniles are thought to include the banded water snake (Nerodia fasciata), other water snakes (Nerodia sp.), the largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) and the grackle (Quiscalus sp.). However the skin may contain some noxious substances or malodorous secretions as some snakes, including the indigo snake (Drymarchon), have been observed gagging and retching after eating a river frog. Even after the frog has been regurgitated, the snake continued to wipe its mouth on the ground. Status The river frog has a wide range and is quite common in much of that range. The population appears to be large and reasonably stable and the main threat the frog faces is degradation of its habitat. However, it is present in a number of protected areas and the IUCN considers its conservation status to be of \\"least concern\\". References * (2005): Phylogeny of the New World true frogs (Rana).

It is active both by day and night, and feeds on beetles, flies, caddisflies, stoneflies, spiders, and harvestmen. In Galicia and lowland Portugal, breeding takes place from November to March, but in upland areas, it occurs from March to May. Amplexus, with the male clinging to the back of the female, takes place in the water. Small clumps of eggs with a gelatinous coat are laid and are stuck to water weeds or placed beneath underwater stones. When the tadpoles hatch, they feed on vegetable matter and take about three months before they undergo metamorphosis into juvenile frogs. These are about long. Males become mature when they are about in length and females when they are rather larger. Conservation status The Iberian frog is threatened by habitat loss through agriculture, deforestation, and the planting of non- native woodlands. Tourist development and recreational use of the land may cause disturbances. Introduced fish species and the presence of the American mink (Neovison vison), escaped from fur farms, may also reduce numbers. Parts of its range include two national parks, Parque Natural del Gorbea and Parque Natural de Izki, and in these it is protected. In other places, especially in the Sistema Central Mountains and Extremadura in Spain, populations are shrinking. The species is classified as being near threatened in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

Intelisys is founder of Cloud Services University (2012), the first cloud education platform designed exclusively for channel-based sales professionals. Intelisys delivers supplier neutral solutions to end-user customers through a nationwide network of telecom, data and cloud sales and consulting channel professionals via the two-tier distribution model favored in sales of telecommunications network services and cloud services referred to as “the channel”. History Intelisys was founded in December 1994 by Rick Dellar, Rick Sheldon and Rick Balzer, settling at its headquarters in Petaluma, California, in 1998, as part of what was once known as Telecom Valley. In 1995, Rick Balzer exited the business; and Rick Dellar and Rick Sheldon moved forward as sole owners. The company was founded to support U.S. independent telecom channel sales agents in growing their businesses. In January 2006, Intelisys entered a merger with Resource Communications, owned by Dana Topping. Dana Topping is the creator of hosted software service Audex, which was designed to provide independent telecom agencies, and related telecom consultants and distributors, with an information management service to streamline business processes and to provide their customers a managed services offer that gives them visibility to all of their telecommunications services. Together, Dellar, Sheldon and Topping operate as majority owners and lead the overall strategic direction of the company. Jay Bradley was promoted to President of the company in 2007, when the company restructured with the goal of managing day-to-day operations of the business through a professional executive management team. He first joined Intelisys as Vice President of Marketing and Business Development in October 2002. Mr. Bradley brought 20 years of telecom sales, marketing and management experience to the company, 10 of which were spent with MCI Communications. In September 2010, Intelisys unveiled a Partner Investment Program that provides financial capital to its sales partners outside of traditional banking relationships. Financing is secured by existing, or future, commissions and loan repayment is triggered by growth milestones designed to be flexible and favorable. In May 2012, Intelisys acquired the Terrapin Solutions-owned Cloud Services Coalition, as it intensified its focus on cloud services. With the acquisition, Intelisys created the new business unit Intelisys Cloud Services and Complex Bids, which was designed to focus on supporting channel sales partners through the entire telecom and cloud sales processes, including technical, business and application discovery, solution design, project management and turnkey onsite installation and training. Sole owner of Terrapin Solutions, Andrew Pryfogle, was brought on to lead the new unit as Senior VP Cloud Transformation. In June 2012, following the acquisition of Cloud Services Coalition, Intelisys launched its education platform Intelisys Cloud Services University (iCSU), the first of its kind, designed to provide practical training to channel sales professionals on identifying, designing and selling cloud solutions. In June 2013, an alliance between distributors Intelisys and ScanSource was formed to enable ScanSource channel partners to access Intelisys' suppliers and resources necessary to successfully leverage a services-based business model, whether historically IT or telco-focused. Intelisys celebrated its 20-year anniversary in December 2014. In April 2015, the company launched a mobile app to bring its website and partner platform functionality to mobile devices in a faster, easier-to-navigate format. In March 2016, Intelisys launched Intelisys Global, the UK-based European subsidiary of Intelisys, to service and support the European Partner community. In July 2016, Intelisys Global signed Equinix as an inaugural Supplier Partner. ScanSource announced a definitive agreement to acquire Intelisys Communications, Inc. in August 2016. Under the agreement, the all-cash transaction included an initial purchase price of approximately $83.6 million, plus earn-out payments based on earnings before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) over the next four years. ScanSource broadened its capabilities by entering the telecom and cloud services market with the acquisition of Intelisys, and accelerated Intelisys’ ability to extend its two-tier distribution model to the ScanSource VAR community. The acquisition was finalized on August 25, 2016. The Intelisys management team remains in place, including co-owners Rick Dellar, Rick Sheldon, and Dana Topping. Jay Bradley continues to serve as president of Intelisys, and his senior leadership team also remains in place. Intelisys Cloud Services University In June 2012, following the acquisition of Cloud Services Coalition, Intelisys launched its education platform Intelisys Cloud Services University (iCSU), the first of its kind, designed to provide practical training to channel sales professionals on identifying, designing and selling cloud solutions. The first courses offered by Intelisys Cloud Services University leveraged Polycom’s telepresence technology, and were held bimonthly at Polycom Learning Centers throughout the United States, including Atlanta, Austin, Boston/Andover, Chicago/Rosemont, Dallas/Irving, Denver/Westminster, New York City, Orange County/Irvine, Santa Clara, Seattle/Bellevue, and Washington, D.C./Herndon. In February 2015, Intelisys Cloud Services University expanded its offering with the launch of the first available cloud professional certification program for channel sales professionals (as opposed to technical channel professionals or direct sales professionals) seeking to expand their knowledge and credibility in the area of cloud services. The self-paced learning program results in professional certification designed to help telecom agents, consultants, VARs, MSPs, integrators and IT solution providers make the shift to cloud services. Advanced Commissions Program Intelisys launched its Advanced Commissions Program in 2013, providing channel partners the opportunity to receive commissions via a recurring revenue model while offering cloud and carrier services, in an effort to attract VARs (Value-Added Reseller) to its partner base. Intelisys allocated $2 million to fund the initial launch of its Advanced Commission Program, which was designed to give VARs the flexibility to choose how they receive commission payments: one-time, up-front payments based on the full contract value; traditional monthly annuity payments; or a combination of the two. This program allows VARs, Managed Service Providers (MSPs) and IT solution providers to secure the up-front cash needed before moving to a recurring revenue model. Drive for 5! On April 1, 2015, Intelisys launched the incentive program Drive for 5!, designed to award one Intelisys Sales Partner with $1,000,000 for being the first to achieve $5 million in monthly recurring revenue through the technology services distributor. Intelisys has several Platinum Partners, each of whom has achieved $1 million in monthly recurring revenue, for which they received an all-expenses paid trip for two to anywhere in the world. Among them are NetSource Group, Global Communications Group, LanYap Networks, Subsidium Technologies, D&M; Enterprise Group, and LinkSource Technologies. Intelisys Global In March 2016, Intelisys announced the launch of Intelisys Global, the European subsidiary of Intelisys, to service and support the \\"European Partner community\\" as they sell telecom, connectivity and cloud services to business customers around the globe, with dedicated international support in the UK. The Intelisys Global London office is under the management of Stephen Hackett, a 15-year telecom industry veteran, solidifying the company's entry into the international market and opening the doors for Intelisys to expand outside of the United States.

Location The population of Baependi as of 2006 was estimated to be 18,173 people living at an altitude of 893 meters. The area of the municipality is 751.748 km². The city belongs to the mesoregion of Sul e Sudoeste de Minas and to the microregion of São Lourenço. The municipality contains 39.93% of the Serra do Papagaio State Park, created in 1998. Toponym \\"Baependi\\" is derived from the tupi language and means \\"water of the flattened thing\\"; mba'e (\\"thing\\"), peb (\\"flattened\\") and 'y (\\"water or river\\"). Another theory says that the name comes from the tupi mbaé-pindi, meaning \\"open glade\\". History  According to some reports, mining occurred in the southern region from 1601. The conquest of Baependi happened, however, at the end of the seventeenth century, around 1692, when the Paulistas Antonio Delgado da Veiga, his son Joao da Veiga and uncle Miguel Garcia and Captain Manoel Garcia Velho, started from Taubaté in search of gold. Crossing the Serra da Mantiqueira, they reached a site called maependi (mbaé-pindi means \\"open clearing\\" in Tupi-guarani). The city is a remnant of the so-called cycle of Gold in Minas Gerais. Baependi developed along the Estrada Real - the first major means of regular communication in Brazil which linked the mines to the port of Paraty in Rio de Janeiro from where gold was shipped to Europe. The Madeiran Tomé Rodrigues Nogueira do Ó (1715), Captain- mor and Ombudsman of Quintos the \\"registration of the Mantiqueira\\" was one of the first residents of the site and is considered the founder of the city as the first builder. Mining was, gradually, replaced by agriculture and cattle breeding. It had a large tobacco plantation, which made Baependi the centre of production of the Province of Minas Gerais and represented a major source of wealth until the mid-nineteenth century. Nowadays the municipality's economy is based on agriculture, handicrafts, gem stones, quartzite and tourism, due to the natural environment of the city, surrounded by mountains, forests, rivers and numerous waterfalls. Craft is an important economic activity in Baependi. Pieces made in bamboo, straw, corn and coffee wood are distributed in large urban centres such as São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Belo Horizonte. Culture Baependi, as of 2015, is known to follow natural day-night sleep cycles, despite the availability of artificial lighting and electricity. The countryside surrounding Baependi rise at 6h30 and sleep at 21h20, while the town does so at 7h15 and 22h20 respectively. The difference is thought to be due to the influence of artificial lighting. The community is being studied due to their adherence to a diurnal/nocturnal cycle similar to that of ancestral humans. Religion Baependi has had a parish church since 1723. The ceremony of the Holy Week in Baependi has continued for over 200 years, being one of the most traditional of Minas Gerais. The daily processions accompanied by band and choir represent the passion and death of Jesus Christ. Churches include: * the Santuário de Nossa Senhora Conceição (better known as church of Nhá Chica) * the parish church Nossa Senhora do Montserrat (1754) * Nossa Senhora da Boa Morte (1815) * Rosario (1820) References See also * List of municipalities in Minas Gerais Category:Municipalities in Minas Gerais ","title":"Baependi"},{"id":"12409311","text":"Scott Robert Coolbaugh (born June 13, 1966) is an American former professional baseball third baseman, and current assistant hitting coach for the Chicago White Sox of the Major League Baseball (MLB).

Development Development of the rifle started in 1963 as a joint project between SIG and Beretta. The latter had already cooperated with SIG on the production of the SG 510-4 rifle for Chile. Initial prototypes of the 5.56 mm rifle used the delayed-blowback operating system of the SIG SG 510. However, this operating system proved to be problematic with the relatively \\"weak\\" 5.56×45mm NATO intermediate cartridge, and the designers were forced to use a gas-operated, roller-locked system. In 1968, Beretta ceased development with SIG, and went to work on their own 5.56 mm rifle design resulting in the outwardly similar AR70, later known as AR70/223. Due to a lack of sales, SIG abandoned the SG 530 in the 1970s in favor of developing the SG 540 series. Bibliography * Hogg, Ian V. and Weeks, John S. Military Small Arms of the 20th Century.

Her purpose was to aid ships, usually by towing, on the high seas or in combat or post-combat areas, plus \\"other duties as assigned.\\" She served in the Atlantic Ocean and, at war's end, returned home proudly with three battle stars to her credit. Moreno was laid down as AT-87, on 26 June 1942, by William Cramp & Sons of Philadelphia; launched on 9 July 1942; sponsored by Mrs. Charles H. Kramb; and commissioned on 30 November 1942, Lt. (jg.) Victor H. Kyllberg in command.  World War II Atlantic Ocean operations  Following shakedown out of Norfolk, Virginia, Moreno, a fleet tug equipped with good firefighting, salvage, and repair facilities to allow participation in combat operations, sailed, on 21 January 1943, for Bermuda. There she provided towing and escort services to vessels attached to the naval operating base and assigned to convoys using the southern lanes across the North Atlantic to Africa and Europe. On 3 March, she rendezvoused with task force TF 32 and set out for Gibraltar, returning to Norfolk, Virginia, with TF 63 on 28 April. While at sea with those forces, Moreno was employed as an escort and as a standby tug.  Supporting the invasion of Sicily  After availability at Norfolk, Moreno again headed out across the Atlantic, sailing on 8 June with TF 65\\\\. She anchored off Oran on the 22nd, and then continued on to Bizerte, where she prepared for the invasion of southern Sicily.  Damaged by a near miss  On 6 July, while still at Bizerte, she was caught in an air raid during which a near miss injured three men and damaged the superstructure and rigging. By 8 July, however, she was underway in an LST convoy bound for Sicily. Despite heavy weather, \\"Joss\\" Force arrived off Licata early on the 10th, and the Falconara Attack Group headed toward \\"Beach Blue\\" while Moreno stood by to provide aid if called upon. Later in the day, the tug shifted to Licata, anchoring in the bay. Through 10 August, she salvaged and repaired damaged vessels, fought fires, and cleared beachhead landing craft at Licata, Gela, Port Empedocle, Sciacca, and Marsala. On the 11th, she commenced planting buoys in swept channels at Marsala and off the western coast of the island. Detached on the 21st, she joined a merchant convoy and sailed to Tunis, where, her part in \\"Operation Husky\\" completed, she prepared for \\"Operation Avalanche\\", the assault at Salerno.  Supporting invasion of Italy operations  Sailing with TF 81 on 7 September, she was in the Gulf of Salerno, standing off the landing beaches at Paestum, by 0100 on the 9th. She remained in the area, conducting firefighting, salvage, repair, and fueling operations in spite of frequent air raids, until 4 November, when she departed for Bizerte. Thence, she followed the African coast to Algiers for availability and salvage work in that area. On 11 February 1944, Moreno sailed back to Bizerte where she received towing assignments which took her to Taranto, Malta, and Naples. From 6 April through 27 July, Moreno, now ATF 87 (effective 15 May), was employed in convoy work from Naples and Palermo to Bizerte, shuttling damaged LCTs south, and those in good repair north. She then steamed to Algiers, and from there, to Corsica and various Italian ports before arriving at Palermo to prepare for \\"Operation Dragoon\\", the invasion of southern France.  Invasion of southern France operations  Departing Palermo on 7 August, she proceeded first to Naples and then to Ajaccio, where, on the 13th, she joined convoy 89.1 and sailed for St. Raphael. On the 15th, she was off Green Beach providing services similar to those performed at Licata and Paestum. On the 18th, she shifted to the Gulf of St. Tropez, remaining there until 9 October. From southern France, Moreno returned to Palermo for availability and then commenced towing and escort services between various points in Italy, Corsica, France, and north Africa. On 7 March 1945, she took in tow and headed for Odessa, where the latter's cargo, food, clothing and medicine, was off loaded for distribution to American soldiers recently released from German POW camps by Red Army units.  Returning Stateside  Moreno, with Tackle, returned to Oran on 13 April, only to depart, again with Tackle in tow, three days later for the Azores. The two vessels were engaged in repair work until 6 May, when they joined convoy GUS 87 and steamed west. Arriving at Norfolk on 18 May, Moreno entered the Norfolk Navy Yard for a brief overhaul. On 5 July, she got underway for Charleston, South Carolina, where she took ARDC-11 and an Army tug in tow.  Transfer to the Pacific Fleet  Leaving the Army vessel in Panama, Moreno continued up the west coast to San Diego, California, arriving on 9 September. She remained in operation with the U.S. Pacific Fleet until ordered back to the Atlantic at the end of the year.  Post-war decommissioning  On 17 May 1946, Moreno reported to the U.S. 16th Fleet for inactivation, decommissioning on 13 August and berthing at Orange, Texas. The diesel electric, single screw tug remained in the Reserve Fleet until transferred to the Maritime Administration and moved to the Beaumont NDRF on 15 December 1960. Moreno was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 September 1961. Moreno remained in the Beaumont NDRF until 15 December 1986 when she was returned to the Navy to be prepared for target use.https://pmars.marad.dot.gov/NewCards/3468_6424BF.jpg Moreno was sunk on 6 October 1988 during a test of the Penguin Missile.http://www.navsea.navy.mil/teamships/Inactiveships/pdf/ship_history.pdf  Awards  Moreno received three battle stars for World War II service.

Personal life The eldest of four children, Whang emigrated to the United States in December 1951 at the age of 20, arriving at San Francisco, California by ship. After arriving, he enrolled in the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn to study electrical engineering; he received his bachelor's degree in 1956, and his master's from the same school in 1966. He met his wife Mary, who was born in Pyongyang, while a student there; she had emigrated to the States along with her father, who worked with the U.S. army in South Korea. His wife died in 1995 after a ten-year battle with lung disease. Political and religious activities Whang was the founder and first president of the Korean Association of Greater Miami. In 1976, he became an elder at the Korean Presbyterian Church of Miami. In 1998, he received the Essie Silva Community Builder Award from the United Way of America's Miami-Dade branch. In 1999, he became the first Asian American to serve as chairman of the county Community Relations Board, which was established in 1963. He was especially interested in promoting better relations between the Korean American and African American communities, an issue which became of greater concern to him in the aftermath of the 1992 Los Angeles riots. Alternative health Apart from his political activities, Whang ran his own business, Alkalife, which promotes alternative health practices such as the use of far infrared radiation to promote growth and health of living cells. He self-published a book entitled Aging and Reverse Aging, about the alleged health benefits of high-alkaline water and other alternative health practices. After his death, his son Peter Whang took over as Alkalife's head of research and development.

Its natural habitats are temperate grassland, rivers, swamps, irrigated land, and seasonally flooded agricultural land.  Characteristics  Defining characteristics include a slender, reddish-brown body with a long, narrow head. The average snout-vent length is 48 mm for males. Females are usually much larger than males, with lengths of about 54 mm. Neither gender has a vocal sac, but males develop yellowish-brown nuptial pads and sing during mating season (which lasts from January to March). Songs consist of 10 to 20 notes.  Habitat  R. japonica occurs in Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu in Japan to the southern region of China. Within Japan, it inhabits mostly hillsides and plains, and is rarely seen in mountain ranges. More specifically, the brown frog resides in temperate grasslands, hillsides, plains, rivers, swamps, irrigated land, and seasonally flooded agricultural land.  Translucent breed  By combining two types of recessive genes that cause frogs to become translucent, a breed of Rana japonica, popularly called \\"see-through frogs\\", were produced by Japanese scientists in 2007 to see the frog's organs, blood cells, and eggs without dissection. The skin is not clear, but translucent. Cancer growths can be seen more easily.Photo in the News: See-Through Frog Bred in Japan. News.nationalgeographic.com (2010-10-28).

Jim Anderson had left the band and was replaced by drummer Scott Batiste. Shepard Fairey directed The Pattern's first video for the single \\"Fragile Awareness\\". After the record's release on Lookout Records (in the US), Wichita Recordings (in the UK), and JVC (in Japan), The Pattern continued to tour the United States and the UK with bands such as The Hives, The Datsuns, The Mooney Suzuki, and Clinic. Original bassist Carson Bell and drummer Scott Batiste left the band in 2003. The Pattern continued to tour the United States and then eventually called it quits in 2004. Chris Appelgren now plays drums in West Bestern, Carson Bell went on to play bass with former Pattern tour mates The Mooney Suzuki, Scott Batiste plays drums in the metal band Saviours, Andy Asp and Jim Anderson play together in SMOKERS.

It is endemic to northern and central Taiwan. Description Rana longicrus is a slender-bodied frog with relatively long legs. Males measure and females in snout–vent length. Reproduction The breeding season in Aoti, northern Taiwan, is from November to March. The smallest mature male measured SVL and smallest gravid female SVL. Both sexes appear to reach this size by the end of their first year. Peak breeding occurred in December but is probably influenced by rain. Egg clutches of 600-2,000 eggs are laid in water. Metamorphosis occurs after about two months. However, survival to metamorphosis is low because of disturbance by human activities (plowing of ricefields) and by the desiccation. Diet Rana longicrus feed primarily on arachnids and insect larvae and adults (often ants or beetles). In winter when they spend more time near water also crustaceans are eaten. Habitat and conservation Rana longicrus occurs in subtropical broad-leaf forests as well as cultivated fields below elevation. Breeding takes place in marshes, pools, and ponds.

Since they owned their own weapons there was little standardization, and the early rifles were generally designed for hunting. Jäger were not just skilled riflemen, they were also able to handle and maintain delicate, accurate rifles in an age when very few soldiers had mechanical skills. Jäger rifles (late 18th century) By the late 18th century, these rifles had evolved to being shorter than earlier hunting weapons and were generally shorter than the typical military musket, with no provision for a bayonet. The shorter weapon was easier to load and more practical in skirmish combat. However, there was some loss of accuracy, and the shorter barrel used meant the powder charges less efficiently. Jäger rifles typically had a length around , with a barrel, and weighed around . Frequently there was a scrolled brass trigger guard to provide a better grip and a raised cheek-rest for support when aiming. Most rifles had a butt-trap or patch box about six inches long for storing greased linen patches and tools. The patch box lids were generally brass and were hinged at the rear. Most of these rifles were the personal property of the soldier and could vary substantially in design and decoration. The Jäger rifle concept was adopted by other nations including Britain, which imported German Jäger rifles for use by skirmishers and marksmen. Many of these were Hanoverian and when Britain standardized with its Pattern 1776 rifle, it was essentially a copy of a Jäger style from Hanover. Hessian mercenary troops who fought for the British in the US Revolution included Jäger rifle units. 1810 Neue Korps-Jägerbüchse (Prussia) During the early 19th century, Prussia began to standardize its military rifle. In 1810, as part of its strenuous effort to rebuild its army after the defeat at Jena-Auerstadt, the state officially adopted its first standard rifle, which was a combination of preferred features from previous weapons. It had a 28½\\" .58 caliber tapered and flared barrel, offering good balance. This was the only flintlock military rifle of a major military power to use set triggers, and was the first German rifle that could be fitted with a bayonet. As with most early military rifles used by European forces, they were not designed to supplant the smooth bore musket, but meant to be a complementary weapon used by special units including light infantry, skirmishers, and snipers. 1811 Kavalleriebüchse (Prussia) The 1811 Prussian Cavalry Rifle was almost a completely redesigned: it was a new pattern featuring a new lock and hardware. It had a 17\\" octagonal barrel firing a .60 caliber bullet, but was changed to a round barrel in 1823. 1835 Neue Korps-Jägerbüchse (Prussia) In 1835, the Germans converted most of the 1810 rifles to percussion and adopted a nipple safety, which is an arm that covers the percussion cap to prevent accidental discharge. This was also known as the Potsdam rifle. The barrel length is 28⅝ inches in .60 caliber. Dreyse Needle Gun 1848 (Prussia) Dreyse Needle Gun 1848 The Dreyse needle-gun (Nadelgewehr) was a military breechloading rifle, famous as the arm of the Prussians, who adopted it for service in 1848 as the Prussian Model 1848. Its name comes from its needle-like firing pin, which passed through the cartridge case to detonate a percussion cap at the base of the bullet. The Dreyse rifle was also the first breech-loading rifle to use a bolt-action to open and close the chamber. The gun was the invention of the gunsmith Johann Nikolaus von Dreyse, who, beginning in 1824, had conducted multiple experiments, and in 1836 produced the complete needle-gun. From 1848 onward the gun was gradually introduced into Prussian service, then later into the military forces of many other German states. The employment of the needle gun radically changed military tactics in the 19th century. The needle gun first made its appearance in street fighting during the May Uprising in Dresden in 1849. It also played an important role in the Danish–German War of 1864. The gun saw its heaviest use in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 and the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71. Because the breech-loader made it possible for a Prussian soldier to fire five (or more) shots, even while lying on the ground, in the time that it took his Austrian counterpart to fire one (and then reload while standing), it was seen as allowing the Prussians to sweep the field. The cartridge used with this rifle consisted of the paper case, the bullet, the priming cap and the black- powder charge. The 15.4 mm (0.61 in) bullet was shaped like an acorn, with the broader end forming a point. It was glued in a paper case known as a Sabot. Between this inner lining and the outer case was the powder charge, consisting of 4.8 g (74 grains) of black powder. The upper end of the paper case was rolled up and bound together before the needle could strike the primer that was attached to the base of the bullet; its point then passed through the powder and hit the primer ahead. The theory behind this placement of the primer is that it would give more complete combustion of the charge. In practice the needle-gun proved to have numerous deficiencies: its effective range varied a great deal, a significant amount of gas escaped at the breech when the rifle was fired, and a paper cartridge was used. An improved model, giving greater muzzle velocity and increased speed in loading, was introduced, but this was soon replaced by the Mauser rifle. M1854 Jäger rifle (Bavaria) This percussion weapon combines French and German features with a browned barrel and a rear sight with windage adjustment. It is long, with a .69 caliber barrel. This is among the last military designs prior to adopting the Minie type ammunition. Vereinsgewehr 1856 (Württemberg, Baden, and Hessen) This rifle was based on a Swiss pattern using Minie ammunition in .54 caliber. It was long, with a barrel. Most of these weapons were made in Liege or in the Württemberg state-run factory in Oberndorf. M1858 Jäger rifle (Bavaria) This is a refinement of the Bavarian M1854 adopting Minie type ammunition and using simplified sights. M1858 Podewils gun (Bavaria) The Podewils gun was a 13.9mm calibre rifle used in the Bavarian army since 1858. It was the most common infantry weapon of the Bavarian army in the Austro-Prussian war of 1866 and the Franco-Prussian war of 1870/71. Originally a muzzleloader, it was converted to breechloading in 1867, the so-called Lindner conversion. In 1869 the Bavarian army started to replace it with the Werder breechloader, but due to budgetary constrains by 1870 most Bavarian troops still used the Podewils while only four infantry battalions had received the Werder (primarily Jäger units). M1869 and M1869 \\"Aptiertes\\" Werder (Bavaria) M1869 Werder rifle Bavaria was engaged in several central European conflicts during the late 19th century, opposing Prussia in the Austro-Prussian war in 1866; however it then joined Prussia against France in 1870–71. Bavaria remained an autonomous state bound by treaty to Prussia between 1866 and 1870 and was incorporated into the newly established German Empire in 1871. In 1869, Bavaria adopted the Werder M1869 chambered for a rimmed centerfire metallic cartridge, the 11×50mmR, a rifle designed by Johann L. Werder based on the Peabody dropping block action, to replace the breech loaded Linder. After Prussia and others adopted the Mauser M1871 as their standard rifle Bavaria modified their Werder rifles into the \\"M1869 Aptiertes Werder\\", chambered for the same 11×60mmR cartridge as the Mauser M1871 used. The Werder remained the primary Bavarian arm until replaced by the Gewehr 1888. Infanteriegewehr M71, 1871 Mauser Mauser M1871 The Mauser Model 1871 adopted as the Gewehr 71 or Infanterie-Gewehr 71 ( I.G.Mod.71 first of many military rifles manufactured to the designs of Peter-Paul and Wilhelm Mauser of the Mauser company. During 1870–71 trials with many different rifles took place; the \\"M1869 Bavarian Werder\\" was the Mausers' chief competitor. The Mauser was provisionally adopted at the end of 1871 pending the development of an appropriate safety. It was adopted by the German Empire, excluding Bavaria. The action was not based on its predecessor, the Dreyse needle-gun, which had been in service for 30 years. The Gewehr 71 is a conventional-looking bolt- action single-shot rifle that uses black-powder cartridges. The action included only a bolt guide rib as its single locking lug, locking forward of the receiving bridge. The now well-recognized Mauser \\"wing\\"-type safety lever was developed for the Gewehr 71. The cartridge was a metallic 11 × 60R bottlenecked case, holding a charge of of black powder, capped with a round- tipped bullet. Infanteriegewehr M71/84, Gew. 71/84 Mauser Model 1871/84 The Russo-Turkish War impressed upon European powers the importance of repeating rifles. The Mauser brothers had been improving the Gewehr 71 design while fulfilling contracts with Serbia. In 1881 Kaiser Wilhelm was impressed by a prototype of a Gewehr 71 that featured an eight-round tubular magazine under the barrel, which was loaded while the action was open. The bullet was slightly flattened, to reduce the chance of jamming or the detonation of primers in the tube. There was a lever on the receiver that isolated the magazine, so that the rifle could be fired and loaded one shot at a time, keeping the magazine in reserve. Production ended in 1890 after which time the arsenals had produced nearly 950,000 rifles; however by 1888 the introduction of the French Lebel using smokeless powder and smaller diameter high velocity bullets, made this weapon obsolete. Infanteriegewehr M88, Gewehr 88, Commission Rifle Gewehr 1888 The German Rifle Testing Commission initially tried to find a way to convert the many Gewehr 71/84 rifles into having a viable smokeless powder action; however the decision taken was to design a completely new weapon. The Commission chose not to involve or consult the Mausers. The result was the look of the Lebel, a Mauser-style action, Mannlicher magazine, a jacketed barrel, and a cartridge copied from the Swiss. The Gewehr 88 was designed to use the 7.9mm × 57J cartridge, which is considerably smaller than the 11 mm round of the Gewehr 71. A total of 1,675,000 Gewehr 88s were produced from 1889 to 1897. Infanteriegewehr M98, Gewehr 98 Mauser Gewehr 98 Mauser Model 98 Despite the choice of the Rifle Commission to not consult Paul Mauser in the late 1880s he kept developing better rifles and improved attributes for his firearms, which he sold to other countries. By the 1890s, his improved bolt design, the introduction of a stripper or charger clip loading configuration, and a fixed box magazine impressed Belgium, Turkey, and Argentina, enough for contracts to be signed. Mauser went two steps further in 1892 when he again improved the bolt design by adding an extractor that prevented double feeding from the magazine and changed the single column box magazine to a staggered five cartridge box design. The magazine now fit in the rifle without any part of it protruding in front of the trigger making it less apt to be damaged while still easily and quickly loaded from the five round stripper clips. These improvements were embodied in the Model 1893 (adopted by Spain) and then slight improvements resulted in the 1895/96 model (adopted by Sweden, Mexico, Persia, and the Orange Free State). In 1896 Mauser changed the firing pin distance facilitating faster lock time and accuracy; he also installed a cutout section in the left of the receiver, perfect for a thumb to fill while loading the ammunition from a charger/stripper clip. More impressively, he improved the bolt again by: 1), creating vector holes for gas from a ruptured primer; 2), a shrouded bolt head that protected the shooter from a ruptured cartridge; 3), the bolt head was designed to divert gas away from the face of the shooter; 4), a third bolt lug was added to keep the shooter safe if the two main bolt lugs should fail; and finally 5), a better designed extractor was added. German troops were issued the rifle by 1899 and used them in the Boxer Rebellion of 1901. By 1912 the Gewehr 98 replaced all other rifles for the regular army and first line reserve troops. In 1905 the Patrone S cartridge was adopted by the German army. Whereas the previous cartridge was 7.9mm × 57, a bullet that had a diameter of .318\\" and a round blunt end, this new cartridge, 7.92mm × 57, featured a bullet of the 'spitzer' (pointed) type. The diameter was .323\\", which required the re-barreling of previously issued rifles, including the Gewehr 98 and Gewehr 88. Early Carbines, such as the Kar 98a, Kar 98b, and Kar 98AZ Mauser developed some carbine models in the early 20th century, including the Kar 98 and Kar 98A (Karabiner). They were designed for the cavalry and other forces that needed a smaller weapon. Although it resembled a cut-down Gewehr 98, with a turned-down bolt it was ungainly and had an intense recoil. But by 1908 the Kar 98AZ was introduced, which was very popular with the German forces fighting in the trenches of World War I. In post World War I Germany the government redesignated the Kar 98AZ to be the Kar 98a. This is because in 1923 the Reichswehr created another carbine by altering old Gewehr 98s. Designated the Kar. 98b, they were given a turned-down bolt, a side-mounted sling system, and a newer style of magazine follower. The rear sight was simplified from the large rear sight and altered to a more appropriate target range of 100–2,000 meters. The Kar 98b remained the same length as the Gewehr 98 but was still called a carbine. Karabiner 98K The Karabiner 98k \\"Mauser\\" (often abbreviated \\"K98k\\" or \\"Kar98k\\") was adopted in the mid 1930s and would be the most common infantry rifle in service within the German Army during World War II. The design was developed from the Karabiner 98b, one of the carbines developed from the Model 1898 mentioned before. The K98k was first adopted by the Wehrmacht in 1935 to be their standard issue rifle, with many older versions being converted and shortened as well as the design itself entering production. In the name K98k, the first \\"K\\" stands for karabiner (carbine) and the second \\"k\\" for kurz (short). The \\"98\\" is derived from the earlier rifle's year of adoption (1898), although the carbine itself was adopted in 1935. The K98k is often confused as being the earlier Model 98 design; however, there are notable differences between them. The easiest to spot are its shorter length, and bent, rather than straight bolt handle. Less obvious are that it has different, simpler sights. It was intended to be a \\"universal rifle\\" for all parts of the Heer rather than having both Carbine and full length versions. The weapon has a bolt-action and uses 7.92×57mm ammunition (referred to as 8mm Mauser). It has an effective range of about 800 metres, but when fitted with a high-quality rifle scope, its range increases to 1,000 metres. The K98k has a five-round internal magazine and is loaded from a five-round stripper clip that is inserted into a slot in front of the opened bolt and pushed into the magazine with the thumb. The empty stripper clip is then ejected from the gun when the bolt is pushed forward into position. A trench magazine was also produced that could be attached to the bottom of the internal magazine by removing the floor plate, increasing capacity to 20 rounds, although it still required loading with the clips. Over 14 million of these rifles were produced by various manufacturers. However, this number includes versions of the weapon other than the K98k, such as the Czech vz-24. From 1950 to 1965, Yugoslavia produced a near-carbon copy of the K98k called the Model 1948, which differed only from the German rifle in that it had the shorter bolt-action of the Model 1924 series of Mauser rifles. In addition, in 1943, the Spaniards were manufacturing a slightly modified version, but with a straight bolt handle. Gewehr 41 Gewehr 41 By 1940, it became apparent that some form of a semi- automatic rifle, with a higher rate of fire than existing bolt-action models, was necessary to improve the infantry's combat efficiency. The Wehrmacht issued a specification to various manufacturers, and both Mauser and Walther submitted prototypes that were very similar. The Mauser design, the G41(M), failed. Only 6,673 were produced before production was halted, and of these, 1,673 were returned as unusable. The Walther design, the G41(W), is in outward appearance not unlike the Gewehr 43 (see below). Most metal parts on this rifle were machined steel, and some rifles, especially later examples utilized bakelite type plastic handguards. The Walther design was more successful because the designers had simply neglected the last two restrictions listed in the main article. These rifles, along with their G41(M) counterparts, suffered from gas system fouling defects. These problems seemed to stem from the overly complex muzzle trap system becoming excessively corroded from the use of corrosive salts in the ammunition primers, and carbon fouling. The muzzle assembly consisted of many fine parts and was difficult to disassemble, keep clean, and maintain in field conditions. G41(W) rifles were produced at two factories, namely Walther at Zella Mehlis and Berlin-Lübecker. Varying sources put production figures between 40,000 and 145,000 units. These rifles saw a high attrition rate on the Eastern front. Gewehr 43 G43 In 1941, Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union as part of Operation Barbarossa. Just prior to the opening of hostilities, the Red Army had started re-arming its infantry, replacing its older bolt-action rifles with the new semi-automatic Tokarev SVT38s and SVT40s. This proved to be something of a shock to the Germans, who ramped up their semi-automatic rifle development efforts significantly. The Tokarev used a simple gas-operated mechanism, which was soon emulated by Walther, thus producing the Gewehr 43 (or 'G43') from the handicapped G41. The simpler mechanism of the G43 made it lighter, easier to mass-produce, and far more reliable. The addition of a 10-round detachable box magazine also solved the slow reloading problem. The Gewehr 43 was put into production in October 1943, and followed in 1944 by the Karabiner 43 ('K43'), which was identical to the G43 in every way save for the letter stamped on the side. The G/K43 was issued in limited numbers in 1944 and 1945 to units of the Wehrmacht. Total production by the end of the war was 402,713 of both models, including at least 53,435 sniper rifles: the K43 was the preferred sniper weapon, fitted with the Zielfernrohr 43 ('ZF 4') scope with 4x magnification. The weapon was originally designed for use with the Schiessbecher device for firing rifle grenades (standard on the Kar 98k as well) and the Schalldämpfer suppressor. However these accessories were deemed unsuccessful in tests and were dropped even before the rifle entered serial production. It was also not equipped to use a bayonet. The Gewehr 43 stayed in service with the Czechoslovak army for several years after the war. Sturmgewehr (assault rifle) Sturmgewehr 44 (assault rifle) Developed in Nazi Germany during World War II, the Sturmgewehr was a series of assault rifles that were the first to see major deployment. It is also known by the designations: Maschinenpistole 43, Maschinenpistole 44 (MP43 and MP44, respectively), which denotes earlier versions of the same weapon. MP43, MP44, and StG44 were different names for what was essentially the same rifle, with minor differences in production and dates. The various names were a result of the complicated small arms nomenclature in Nazi Germany. Developed from the Mkb 42(H) \\"machine carbine\\", the 'StG44' combined traits of carbines, submachine guns and automatic rifles. StG is an abbreviation of Sturmgewehr. The name was chosen for propaganda reasons and means \\"assault rifle\\" as in \\"to assault a bunker\\". After the adoption of the StG44, the English translation 'assault rifle' became a common class description of this type of infantry small arm. The rifle was chambered for the 7.92×33mm cartridge, also known as 7.92mm Kurz (German for \\"short\\"). This shorter version of the German standard (7.92×57mm) rifle round, in combination with the weapon's selective-fire design, provided most of the controllable firepower of a submachine gun at close quarters with much of the accuracy and power of a Karabiner 98k bolt-action rifle at intermediate ranges. While the StG44 had less range and power than the more powerful infantry rifles of the day, Wehrmacht studies had shown that most combat engagements occurred at less than 300 meters with the majority within 200 meters.  MKb 42  Contracts for rifles firing the Kurz round were sent to both Walther and Haenel (whose design group was headed by Hugo Schmeisser), they were asked to submit prototype weapons under the name Maschinenkarabiner 1942 (MKb 42, literally \\"machine carbine\\"). Both designs were similar, using a gas-operated action, with both semi-automatic and fully automatic firing modes. While the new version was under development in late 1942, infighting within the Third Reich was in full swing. Adolf Hitler was increasingly concerned with this, and after Hermann Göring had created the FG 42 (Fallschirmjägergewehr or Paratrooper Rifle) in a separate program from the army's similar Gewehr 41 efforts, Hitler cancelled all new rifle projects completely. This included the production of the MKb 42(H). One concern was that the new weapon used a new ammunition type that would further hamper an already daunting logistics problem.  MP43  In order to preserve the weapons development, a new project at Gustloff was started to produce a similar weapon using the original Mauser round, the Mkb 43(G). Whenever Hitler asked about the progress of the rifle, he was always shown one of these prototypes, although there was no intention of producing them. Meanwhile, the newest version of the original Mkb 42(H) was called the Maschinenpistole 43 (MP43) to disguise it as an upgrade to existing submachine guns. Another change fit a rifle grenade launcher attachment from the earlier MKb 42(H) to the MP43/1. Eventually the truth surfaced and Hitler ordered the project stopped once again. However, in March 1943 he allowed the run to continue for evaluation purposes, which then continued until September, and due to the positive combat reports it was allowed to continue.  MP44 and StG44  On 6 April 1944, Hitler issued the following decree: :a) The former MG42 is to retain the same designation :b) The former self-loading rifle, known as the Gewehr 43, shall receive the designation Karabiner 43 (K43). :c) The former new MP, known as the MP43, shall receive the designation StG44 (Sturmgewehr 44). In July 1944 at a meeting of the various army heads about the Eastern Front, when Hitler asked what they needed, a general blurted out \\"More of these new rifles!\\" This caused some confusion, but once Hitler was given a chance to test fire the MP44, he was impressed and gave it the title Sturmgewehr. Seeing the possibility of a propaganda coup, the rifle was again renamed the StG44, to highlight the new class of weapon it represented, translated, it means \\"assault rifle, model 1944\\", thereby introducing the term. By the end of the war, some 425,977 StG44 variants of all types were produced. The assault rifle proved a valuable weapon, especially on the Eastern Front, where it was first deployed. A properly trained soldier with an StG44 had an improved tactical repertoire, in that he could effectively engage targets at longer ranges than with an MP40, but be much more useful than the Kar 98k in close combat, as well as provide light cover fire like a light machine gun. Karabiner S (East Germany) Karabiner S (SKS) The Karabiner S is a German manufactured Russian SKS semi-automatic carbine, which was designed in 1945 by Sergei Gavrilovich Simonov. It is formally known as the Samozaryadniy Karabin sistemi Simonova (Russian: Самозарядный карабин системы Симонова), 1945 (Self-loading Carbine, Simonov's system, 1945), or SKS 45. It was originally planned to serve as the standard issue weapon for the Soviet military forces, alongside the new AK-47. As mass production of AK-pattern rifles increased, the SKS carbine was soon phased out of service. It was quickly replaced entirely by the AK-47, but it remained in second-line service for decades afterwards. MPi-K (East Germany) MPi-KM-72 MPi-KMS-74 The AK-47 is a gas-operated assault rifle used in most Eastern bloc countries including East Germany during the Cold War. Adopted and standardized in 1947, it was designed by Mikhail Kalashnikov and originally produced by Russian manufacturer Izhmash. Compared with most auto-loading rifles of World War II, the AK-47 is compact, of comparable range, moderate power, and capable of selective fire. It was one of the first true assault rifles and remains the most widely used, known as the \\"Best Automatic Assault Rifle\\". More AK-type rifles have been produced than of any other assault rifle type. East German AK copies served with the National People's Army throughout its existence. The MPi-K and MPi-KS were derived from the original AK-47 and AKS, the MPi-KM, MPi-KMS-72 and MPi-KMS-K were derived from the AKM and AKMS, and the MPi- AK-74N, MPi-AKS-74N, and MPi-AKS-74NK, were derived from the AK-74 and AKS-74. StG-940 (East Germany) The StG-940 was procured in 1985 for testing as a possible replacement for the MPi-AK-74N rifle (AK-74). It was designated the Sturmgewehr 940 (\\"Assault Rifle 940\\"), or StG-940. It was cancelled with the end of the Cold War in 1989. G1—FN FAL (West Germany) G1 battle rifle The first German FALs were from an order placed in late 1955/early 1956, for several thousand FN FAL so-called \\"Canada\\" models with wooden furniture and the prong flashhider. These weapons were intended for the Bundesgrenzschutz (border guard) and not the nascent Bundeswehr (armed forces), which at the time used M1 Garands and M1/M2 carbines. In November 1956 West Germany ordered 100,000 additional FALs, designated the G1, for the army. The G1 is distinguished from other FAL weapons by a pressed metal handguard with horizontal lines running almost the entire length, and a unique removable prong flash hider. G1s served in Germany for a relatively short time in the late 1950s and early 1960s. They were replaced in 1959 by the Heckler & Koch G3, based on the Spanish CETME Modelo 58, partly because the Belgians would not grant a license for production of the G1 in Germany. Many G1 FALs were passed on to Turkey after the weapon's withdrawal from German service. G2 – SIG SG 510 (West Germany) The SG 510 was procured in 1956 for testing as a possible replacement for the G1 rifle (FN FAL). It was designated the Gewehr 2 (\\"Rifle No.2\\") or G2. It lost out to a modified version of the CETME rifle by Heckler & Koch designated the G3. Heckler & Koch G3 (West Germany) H&K; G3A3 The G3 (which stands for Gewehr 3, or Rifle No. 3) is a family of select fire battle rifles manufactured by Heckler & Koch. It was adopted as the standard service rifle by the Bundeswehr in 1959 as a replacement for the G1, a modified version of the Belgian FN FAL, and served until 1997 when it was replaced by the G36. The G3 was chambered for the 7.62×51mm NATO cartridge.  Development  After World War II the Spanish state arms company CETME (1949–) employed the German arms designer Ludwig Vorgrimler. Vorgrimler had worked for Mauser before and during the war, and was the designer of the experimental German assault rifle known as \\"Gerät 06\\" or Stg.45(M). The design evolved into the CETME rifle, later adopted in 1958 by the Spanish Army as the Assault Rifle Model 58. In 1956 the German Army bought 400 CETME rifles. After extensive testing, they requested numerous changes in the CETME design. After these were incorporated, Heckler & Koch obtained a license for further production.http://world.guns.ru/assault/as60-e.htm The G3 rifle has been widely praised for its relatively compact size and sturdy stamped steel construction, which also enabled lower production costs compared to many other 7.62 mm NATO rifles. Heavy weight and stiff trigger pull have been cited as the weapon's chief disadvantages, along with a rather sharp recoil and less- than-ideal pointing and handling characteristics.  Variants of the G3  The G3 has served as the basis for a wide variety of other H&K; firearms, including weapons in different calibers and various sniper rifles. The HK 33 and G41 are related firearms, and are essentially a G3 scaled down to 5.56×45mm NATO. The G3 and its variants have been used by the armed forces and police in a wide variety of countries. As a result, it has seen use in a number of conflicts during the late 20th century. Its first known combat use was by Portuguese Armed Forces during their war in Africa. Portuguese forces were unable to carry large quantities of heavy 7.62 mm NATO ammunition on long patrols, the resulting lack of firepower was occasionally a handicap when encountering enemy forces equipped with the AK-47. G3 rifles also saw action with the West German police during the failed rescue attempt of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympics in Munich. The situation prompted development of the PSG-1 sniper rifle (substantially derived from the G3). G4 – Armalite AR-10 (West Germany) The AR-10 was procured in 1958 for testing as a possible replacement for the G1 rifle (FN FAL). It was designated the Gewehr 4 (\\"Rifle No.4\\"), or G4. It lost out to a modified version of the CETME rifle by Heckler & Koch designated the G3. Heckler & Koch G11 (West Germany) Heckler & Koch started designing the G11 in the 1970s, when the Bundeswehr asked them to develop a new weapon system to replace the 1950s vintage 7.62 × 51 mm G3 rifle. It was to be used by commandos and special forces. It was cancelled when the Cold War ended in 1989. Heckler & Koch G41 (West Germany) Heckler & Koch also began designing the G41 in the 1970s, when the Bundeswehr asked them to develop a new weapon system to replace the 1950s vintage 7.62 × 51 mm G3 rifle. It was an update of the HK33 designed to use NATO STANAG accessories. It too was cancelled when the Cold War ended in 1989. Heckler & Koch G36 (Germany) H&K; G36 The 'G36' (company designation, Bundeswehr designation Gewehr G36) is an assault rifle designed in the early 1990s and manufactured in Germany by Heckler & Koch. It is the current service rifle of the German and the Spanish Armed Forces among others. A family of variants exists, many of which have been adopted by police or military forces. The G36 replaced the G3 as the main infantry weapon of the Bundeswehr in 1997, a process that is now considered complete. Heckler & Koch started designing the G36 in 1990. The Bundeswehr needed a replacement for the 1950s vintage G3 that would be cheaper than the proposed G41 and G11. Two earlier Heckler and Koch designs, the revolutionary G11 (it was designed to fire caseless ammunition) and the more conventional G41, were both rejected in 1989 due to the end of the Cold War. Haenel MK 556 On September 15, 2020, the Bundeswehr selected the Haenel MK 556 to replace the HK G36 as their new service rifle.

Karl Selter (24 June 1898 in Koeru, Estonia – 31 January 1958 in Geneva, Switzerland) was an Estonian politician and a Minister of Foreign Affairs of Estonia. He served as Minister of Economic Affairs from 1933 to 1938 and as minister of Foreign affairs from 1938 to 1939. His historically most memorable act was to sign a non-aggression and mutual assistance treaty with the Soviet leaders in Moscow in September 1939. This was also his personal and national Estonian most tragic act. It followed a brutal ultimatum from the Soviet Foreign Minister, Vyacheslav Molotov on 24 September. Molotov said to Setler: Estonia gained sovereignty when the Soviet Union was powerless, but you “don’t think that this can last… forever… The Soviet Union is now a great power whose interests need to be taken into consideration. I tell you—the Soviet Union needs enlargement of her security guarantee system; for this purpose she needs an exit to the Baltic Sea … I ask you, do not compel us to use force against Estonia.”Cited in Jonathan Haslam, \\"Soviet Foreign Policy 1939-1941: Isolation and Expansion,\\" Soviet Union/Union Sovietique, 18/1-3, (1991): p 110. The enforced in this manner treaty gave the Soviet army a right to set up military bases in Estonia, and it significantly reduced Estonia's independence until Estonia was formally incorporated into the Soviet Union between June and August 1940. Selter left Estonia in November 1939, resigning both as Foreign Minister and as a member of Parliament. He moved to Geneva, Switzerland as a diplomat. After Germany occupied Estonia between 1941 and 1944, and after it was re- incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1944, he stayed in Switzerland as an exiled diplomat and politician. * References Category:1898 births Category:1958 deaths Category:People from Järva Parish Category:People from the Governorate of Estonia Category:Patriotic League (Estonia) politicians Category:Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Estonia Category:Finance ministers of Estonia Category:Government ministers of Estonia Category:Members of the Rahvuskogu Category:Members of the Riigivolikogu Category:Envoys of Estonia Category:University of Tartu alumni Category:Estonian military personnel of the Estonian War of Independence Category:Recipients of the Military Order of the Cross of the Eagle, Class I Category:20th-century Estonian politicians ","title":"Karl Selter"},{"id":"12409894","text":"The Montezuma leopard frog, Lithobates montezumae, is a species of frog in the family Ranidae endemic to Mexico.

It is found in eastern Cambodia, southern Laos, and central Vietnam. This frog is highly unusual because it turns from its daytime green color to brown at night. Etymology The specific name morafkai honors David Joseph Morafka, an American herpetologist. Accordingly, common names Morafka's frog and Morafkai frog has been proposed for this species. Description Adult males measure and adult females in snout–vent length. The body is dorso-ventrally compressed. The head is broad. The eye is large and prominent. The tympanum is round, relatively large, and distinct; the supratympanic fold is weak. The digits bear large discs, and the toes are fully webbed in females and almost so in males. The dorsal coloration is usually bright green in daylight, but turns brown at night, sometimes with black spots. The flanks are yellow and grey, and the ventrum is creamy white. The limbs have black transverse bars. The upper lip has yellow-white stripe that reaches a glandule above the arm insertion. The iris is golden. Habitat and conservation Odorrana morafkai is known over an altitudinal range of above sea level, from lowland forests to montane cloud forests dominated by evergreen or bamboo and evergreen vegetation. It is typically observed near streams on rocks, leaf litter, herbaceous vegetation, or trees as high as 4 m above the ground. The tadpoles likely develop in streams, as in other Odorrana. Although not considered threatened, this species is likely to be suffering from habitat loss. It may also be impacted by harvesting for food, with the preferential harvest of large females. It is present in several protected areas, although the aforementioned threats apply also to some protected areas.

Pieter Langendijk (Haarlem, 25 July 1683 – Haarlem, 9 or 18 July 1756) was a damask weaver, city artist, dramatist, and poet. Life Arlequyn Actionist (1720), a mockery of stockjobbery Pieter was the son of Arend Kort, a mason born in Langedijk. His father died in 1689 so he temporarily came under the protection of the Amsterdam poet William Sewell.Pieter Langendijk in \\"De Nederlandse en Vlaamse auteurs\\", by G.J. van Bork and P.J. Verkruijsse, De Haan, Weesp 1985, in the DBNL In 1695, they moved to the Hague and his mother began a linen business. Pieter became a weaver and pattern draughtsman and joined artist circles, where he began to write poetry. Around 1708 Pieter took a course in drawing and painting with Frans van Steenwijk. On his 28th birthday his Don Quichot op de Bruiloft van Kamacho appeared. It proved a success and began a permanent run at the Schouwberg of Van Campen. The farces De zwetser and The mutual marriage- deception appeared the next year. Pieter wrote yet more comedies in the style of Molière, who he also translated and wrote about. With Hermanus Angelkot, he wrote Cato, dedicated to the mayor Nicolaes Witsen. Quincampoix, or the gamblers on the Stock Exchange became very famous, written in the notorious year 1720 that John Law ruined many investors in Paris. Arlequin Actionist was a commedia dell'arte farce on the stockjobbery, one act long, with a real fight, dance and music. In 1721 he became \\"Factor\\" of the Haarlem Society Trou Moet Blycken and he moved back to Haarlem with his mother in 1722. In the same year he was appointed as city-artist to Haarlem, and wrote yearly poems for the city from 1724-1744. He had a house outside the city, while he could still get out the city. After his mother died in 1727, he married a sickly and moody woman who died eleven years later. In 1747, he had to sell a large part of its books and possessions. Pieter lived in Haarlem's Proveniershuis, where he was given free accommodation in return for writing a history of the city. The previous description of the city was from 1628, written by Samuel Ampzing. On his sickbed he wanted to be baptized at home, and \\"only five days did Pieter survive after this religious performance...\\" Works Pieter wrote five pieces of comparable length, in which symmetry played a role. With exposition, intrigue and crisis, he respected the unities of time, place and action, using this classicist form to hold a mirror up to the bourgeoisie. Nowhere did the tone become moralizing, but was more a \\"comedy of manners\\" (comédies des moeurs), showing the hypocrisy of those in the higher positions (i.e., the higher bourgeoisie or the impoverished middle-classes). Pieter wrote only a single tragedy, at the end of his life. Het wederzijds huwelijksbedrog (The Mutual Marriage Deception) In this comedy, Lodewijk meets Charlotte. Lodewijk is an aristocrat, in great financial difficulties but acting as if he is a rich Polish count. He has a friend called Jan, who proposes to act out one of his barons, so to flirt with the maid of Charlotte: Klaartje. Jan served under Karel in the army, but left as a traitor. Charlotte also comes from the impoverished aristocracy, and acts as if her situation is more prosperous as well. It is very comical to see how both sides try to convince the other that they are extremely wealthy. This 'mutual marriage deception' comes to light when Karel, the brother of Charlotte, unmasks everybody at the theatre. Charlotte and Lodewijk get married anyway, because they have fallen in love with each other. As for Klaartje and Jan, she is disgusted with Jan for lying to her, so she breaks up with him. After that, she tries to get back with her former lover, Hans (who she broke up with when Jan started flirting with her) but he wants nothing of her. In the end, the traitor Jan takes flight from the group, as to avoid punishment from his captain: Karel. De spiegel der vaderlandse kooplieden (The Mirror of Dutch Merchants) This work also holds up a mirror to the audience. Two generations are placed opposite each other: those born in the 17th and 18th centuries. Ernst and Hendrik are conscientious seventeenth-century merchants who, through hard work, gain position. Their sons represent the following, 18th century generations, and are called Lichthart (light heart), husband to Kwistgoed, and Losbol (loose-liver), husband of Zoetje. They waste all the money that their fathers have made and the whole family fortune is lost. De Graaven van Holland, in jaardichten beschreven Bundle of his yearly poems for the city of Haarlem, which formed a series on the Counts of Holland, were compiled with engravings by his nephew Hendrik Spilman in 1745. His work on the history of Haarlem was never published, but his manuscript was used by Gerrit Willem van Oosten de Bruyn in 1765. Works *Spiegel der Vaderlandsche Kooplieden door Pieter Langendijk.

It is threatened by habitat loss. Taxonomy This frog has a convoluted taxonomic history; despite being known since the early 20th century, it was only described in 2011 and even more recently accepted. In 1895, Oskar Boettger described a middle-sized brownish frog species from the Ryūkyū Islands as Rana okinavana.Boettger (1895a,b) It was noted that the type locality was undetermined—perhaps Okinawa, but the specimens were part of a shipment from an animal dealer, not supplied from the person who originally collected them. Some time later, it was mentioned in passing that mid-sized brown frogs were definitely found on Okinawa.Stejneger (1907) However, collectors seeking out the frog described by Boettger there could not find it; they instead encountered that animal on some of the Yaeyama Islands in the southern Ryūkyū Islands. Others believed that the brown frog of the Ryūkyūs occurred only on Okinawa, and that this consequently must be Boettger's R. okinavana. When World War II interrupted further research, Boettger's taxon was firmly associated with the Okinawan brown frogs, though nobody ever had bothered to travel to the Senckenberg Museum or the Übersee-Museum in Germany to directly compare the type specimensSMF 5830 (the lectotype) and a paralectotype SMF 5831. It is not clear if the single paralectotype in Bremen still exists (Matsui, 2007). with frogs from Okinawa. By the mid-20th century, it was recognized that on both Okinawa and the Yaeyama group brown frogs could be found, and R. okinavana was applied to them, without comparing actual specimens. By the 1970s, it was realized that the Okinawan frogs were not found on the Yaeyama Islands, but only a superficially similar but stouter frog with a distinctive suprabrachial gland and a fold of skin running from the shoulders to the hips. The Yaeyama frogs were at first identified as R. adenopleura and eventually described as a new species, Rana psaltes, in 1985.Kuramoto (1985) In 1999, upon examination of the lectotype of Boettger's R. okinavana, it was realized that this animal was very similar to R. psaltes, differing from the Okinawan brown frogs just as the recently described Yaeyama frogs did. It furthermore turned out that Boettger's brown frog specimens were included in the same batch from the same collector as his specimens of Chirixalus eiffingeri. These specimens must have been collected on the Yaeyama Islands, as the species certainly does not occur on Okinawa. And thus, the frogs formerly known as R. psaltes, which had also been found on Taiwan in the meantime, turned out to be the same species that Boettger had described, and hence according to ICZN rules is now known as R. okinavana.

Early life John Smith Young is the sixth of thirteen children born to Dr. John Y. Young (1793-1868) and Eliza Henry Jones (1807-1882). Though born in Raleigh, North Carolina, he grew up on family cotton plantations in the frontier borderland area of Fayette County, Tennessee (Lagrange postal area), and Marshall County, Mississippi (Lamar postal area). Circa 1847, following the death of John's older sister, Cornelia (1827-1847), Dr. John Y. Young moved his family westward to several locales in southern Arkansas. In the early 1850s, John attended Washington Male Seminary in Washington, Arkansas, where his older brother, Edwin Young, was on the faculty. John studied classic literature in their original languages—Greek, Latin, French, and English. Thereafter, Young attended Centenary College at its original location in Jackson, Louisiana, and graduated in 1855. He studied law, was admitted to the state bar, and started his career as an attorney-of-law in Homer, Claiborne Parish, Louisiana. The 1860 United States federal census lists John S. Young as an attorney in Homer. On August 21, 1861, Young enlisted in Louisiana's 31st Infantry to serve in the Confederate Army during the American Civil War. He rose to the rank of lieutenant. Later life After the war, Young returned to his law practice and married Mattie Hamilton, with whom he had all his children. He was elected or appointed to several public offices: in 1870, a parish (Claiborne Parish) judge; in 1872, a member of the Louisiana House of Representatives, and in 1876, a state judge. In 1878, Young was elected as a Democrat to Congress to replace the deceased John E. Leonard for the final four months of the congressional term. Young chose to not run for reelection. He traveled back to Louisiana, and practiced law in Monroe, Louisiana, and then Shreveport, Louisiana. Young's first wife, Martha (\\"Mattie\\") Hamilton Young, died in 1891. From 1892 to 1900, Young was twice elected and served as Caddo Parish sheriff. Five years after being a widower, Young married a widow and Mattie's cousin, Frances (\\"Fannie\\") Rhoda Hodges. At age 66, Young finished his second term as sheriff and returned to practicing law in various capacities for several more years in Shreveport.

Description Adult males measure in snout–vent length, whereas adult females measure . The overall appearance is moderately slender. The head is longer than it is wide. The snout is obtusely pointed in dorsal view and rounded laterally. The tympanum is distinct and relatively larger in males than in females. The finger and toe tips have discs. The toes are almost fully webbed. Preserved specimens are dorsally gray-blue with brown reticulation and ventrally cream with diffuse gray markings. Habitat and conservation Odorrana orba occurs in evergreen forests near rocky streams at elevations of above sea level. It is typically observed on leaf litter, vegetation, and rocky surfaces. Presumably, the tadpoles develop in streams, as in other Odorrana where reproductive ecology is known. Habitat of this species is threatened by rapidly expanding agriculture, converting forests to agricultural land for cash crop plantations (e.g., rubber, coffee, and tea). It occurs in the Nakai–Nam Theun National Biodiversity Conservation Area in Laos, and probably in some other protected areas that overlap with its predicted range.

The story is about the deadly consequences of receiving a telephone call from the number 999-9999. Plot Tai(Hugo Chakrabongse) is a student in an international school in Phuket. Not academically inclined, he considers himself as \\"his own man\\" who doesn't believe in love and is the head of a clique of pranksters consisting of the attractive but selfish Meena (Paula Taylor), geeky Chi (Thepparit Raiwin), smart but timid Wawa (Norajan Sangigern), and fun-loving Rajit (Titinun Keatanakon). The overweight Moo Priew (Ramit Romon) aspires to join Sun's clique but is rejected every time. One day, Sun and his friends notice a beautiful and mysterious new transfer student nicknamed Rainbow (Sririta Jensen). She was transferred from a high school in Chiang Mai where a student had been impaled on the school's flagpole. When asked how it happened, Rainbow says it involved a demon call from the phone number 999-9999. If one calls it after midnight and says a wish, the wish shall be granted later, but as a consequence, death will come to the caller. None of the clique members believe this, and Rajit calls it after midnight in front of the others and wishes for a Ferrari. He wakes up the next morning receiving exactly what he wished for by luck. Rajit soon dies from a combination of scorpion attack and malfunctioning car wash machine which slashes his throat with a spinning blade. The rest of the friends still don't believe Rainbow's story and even make wishes themselves, prioritizing only the first part of the deal. Meena wishes to be a Channel V Thailand VJ, only to be killed by a hanging noose at a party afterwards. Soon after Meena's death, Sun begins to investigate about the deadly call and spends more time with Rainbow. However, the other members of his clique continue to make wishes. Chi wishes not to be a geek anymore and is burned by a fire. Moo Priew wants to lose weight, only to die by falling out of a window with his organs pulled out (thus making him thinner). Wawa wishes to be an astronaut student, and sharp gears split her head in two. Sun calls the number, wishing for something he believes couldn't be granted: love. Rainbow then kisses him, and he realizes that his wish was granted. To avoid the possibility of her being killed with him, Sun locks Rainbow in the tower where his clique usually hung out. While watching Rainbow via cameras, Sun realizes that Rainbow is the one causing the deaths of his friends by introducing them to the number, making her a devil's apprentice. When he returns to the tower, Rainbow vanishes, and the number calls Sun, telling him he's going to die. A heavy box falls from the top of the tower, but Sun manages to avoid it, only to fall on a pipe which pierces through his chest, killing him. A flashback set in Rainbow's former school shows Rainbow telling the girls there about the number, hence causing the deaths there later on, including the girl who was impaled on a flagpole.

He is considered by many scholars to be to be the father of Urdu poetry, being the first established poet to have composed Ghazals in Urdu language and compiled a divan (a collection of ghazals where the entire alphabet is used at least once as the last letter to define the rhyme pattern). Before Wali, Indian Ghazals were composed in Persian, almost being replicated in thought and style from the original Persian masters like Saa'di, Jami and Khaqani. Wali began, using not only an Indian language, but Indian themes, idioms and imagery in his ghazals. It is said that his visit to Delhi in 1700, along with his divan of Urdu ghazals created a ripple in the literary circles of the north, inspiring them to produce stalwarts like Zauq, Sauda and Mir. Early life Born in 1667 at Aurangabad, an important city in the present Maharashtra State. He loved travelling, which he regarded as a means of education. He visited Delhi, Surat, Burhanpur and also undertook pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina. Career Wali Mohammed Wali's visit to Delhi in 1700 is considered to be of great significance for Urdu Ghazals. His simple, sensuous and melodious poems in Urdu, awakened the Persian loving poets of Delhi to the beauty and capability of \\"Rekhta\\" (the old name for Urdu) as a medium of poetic expression. Wali Mohammed Wali's visit thus stimulated the growth and development of Urdu Ghazal in Delhi. He died in Ahmedabad in 1707 in what is now Gujarat state, and was buried in the same city. Genre Although Wali tried his hand at a variety of verse forms including the masnavi, qasida, mukhammas, and the rubai., the ghazal is his speciality. He wrote 473 ghazals containing 3,225 couplets (Ashaar). His poems were simple, sensuous & melodious.He was a trend setter in classical poetry who helped establish Urdu ghazal in Delhi by inspiring different poets to write in Urdu It is believed that Wali started to have established the tradition of writing ghazals in Urdu and also influencing the other writers when he visited Delhi. Before that, preferred language for ghazals was Persian. Some of his famous couplets are Jisay Ishq Ka Teer Kaari Lagay Use Zindagi Jag Mein Bhaari Lagay Naa Chode Mohabbat Daame Marg Tak Jisay Yaar Jaanisoon Yaari Lagay Naa Howe Use Jag Mein Hargiz Qaraar Jise Ishq Ki Beqaraari Lagay Har Ek Waqt Mujhe Aashiq Zaar Koon Pyaare Teri Baat pyaari Lagay \\"Wali\\" Koon Kahe Tu Agar Yak Bachan Raqeebon Dil Mein Kataari Lagay Themes His favorite theme was love – both mystical and earthy – and his characteristic tone was one of cheerful affirmation and acceptance, rather than of melancholy grumbling. He was the first Urdu poet to have started the practice of expressing love from the man's point of view, as against the prevailing convention of impersonating as a woman. If, on the one hand, Wali unraveled the beauty and richness of the native language as a poetic medium, on the other, he was alive to the vigor and verve of Persian diction and imagery which he successfully incorporated into the body of his verse. He may thus be called the architect of the modern poetic language, which is a skillful blend of Aam Boli and Persian vocabulary. His diction was unique here is one of his famous ghazal. Yaad karna har ghari us yaar ka Hai wazifa mujh dil-e-bimaar ka. Aarzoo-e-chasma-e-kausar nahin Tishna-lab hun sharbat-e- didaar ka. Aakbat kya howega maalum nahin Dil hua hai mubtla dildaar ka.

Aye Wali hona srijan par nisaar, Mudda hai chashm-e-gohar baar ka. Memorials His memorial tomb in Shahibaug, Ahmedabad was attacked by the Hindu mob during riots in 2002 and replaced with makeshift Hanuman temple. It was completely razed and the road was constructed overnight. After protests from citizens and literary class of city, the Public Interest Litigation was filed in the Gujarat High Court. In 2010, a widely acclaimed short film on Wali's life was made by a film-maker Gopal K. Annam.

As originally designed, the Ba.27 had a fuselage of steel tube construction, skinned with light corrugated alloy metal, and wooden wings and tailplane. Evaluation of the two prototypes by the Regia Aeronautica in 1933 was strongly negative, resulting in an extensive redesign of the aircraft. The fuselage shape was made more rounded and the pilot's open cockpit was moved higher and forward to improve visibility. The corrugated skinning was also replaced with smooth sheet metal. A prototype of this revised version, known as the Metallico, was first flown in June 1934, but Regia Aeronautica's appraisal was only a little more positive.

(1895b): Neue Frösche und Schlangen von den Liukiu-Inseln [\\"New frogs and snakes from the Ryūkyū Islands\\"]. [In German] Zoologischer Anzeiger 18: 266–270. * He could not tell for certain where these specimens were collected, as they had reached him via an animal trader and not from the actual collector, but suspected it to be Okinawa in the central Ryūkyūs, the most accessible island of the archipelago. By 1907, it was known that what supposedly was the same medium-sized brown frog also occurred on the Yaeyama Islands in the southern Ryūkyū archipelago,Stejneger, Leonhard H. (1907): Herpetology of Japan and adjacent territory. Bulletin of the United States National Museum 58 1–577. though subsequently, Boettger's frog could only be found there. Later still, the presence of the brown frogs of Okinawa was verified and they were studied, with scientists believing that Boettger's taxon applied to them. Eventually, the situation had changed to R. okinavana supposedly referring to the Okinawan frogs only, with the Yaeyama frogs being either ignored or believed to belong to another species altogether. This was the situation by the time World War II interrupted further research, with some even believing it did not exist at all. In the mid-20th century, the Okinawan and Yaeyama frogs were again united under R. okinavana, but once again without checking Boettger's type specimens. By the 1970s, however, the southern frogs, though superficially similar in being about the same size and color, were realized to differ significantly from those on Okinawa. Initially identified as R. adenopleura, the Yaeyama harpist frog was described as a new species, Rana psaltes, in 1985.Kuramoto, M. (1985): A new frog (genus Rana) from the Yaeyama group of the Ryukyu Islands. Herpetologica 41: 150–158. In 1999, upon examination of the lectotype of Boettger's R. okinavana,Specimen SMF 5830: Matsui (2007). this animal was found to be very similar to R. psaltes, differing from the Okinawan brown frogs just as the recently described Yaeyama frogs did. Furthermore, Boettger's specimens turned out to be included in the same batch from the same collector as his specimens of Chirixalus eiffingeri. These specimens must have been collected on the Yaeyama Islands, however, as it certainly does not occur on Okinawa. Thus, the frogs formerly known as R. psaltes - which had also been found on Taiwan in the meantime - turned out to be the same species that Boettger had described, hence according to ICZN rules, it is now known as R. okinavana, while the Ryūkyū brown frog has yet to receive a scientific name. Furthermore, some slight differences exist between Boettger's types of R. okinavana and Kuramoto's types of R. psaltes which were collected on Iriomote Island. Should Boettger's specimen, e.g. by ancient DNA analysis, turn out to be from Ishigaki and be subspecifically distinct from the Iriomote population, the latter would become subspecies psaltes.

Finally on December 12, 1856, the legislature passed a bill authorizing a convention to establish a constitution.Journal of the Constitutional Convention of the State of Oregon Held at Salem, Commencing August 17, 1857: Together with the Constitution Adopted by the People, November 9, 1857. Salem: W.H. Byars, 1882. On June 1, 1857, the voters in the territory approved the resolution and elected delegates to a constitutional convention.

Convention Matthew Deady, president of the convention On August 17, 1857, 60 delegates selected by the voters met in Salem to write a state constitution in preparation of statehood. The convention assembled at the Salem Courthouse, with Asa Lovejoy named president pro tem of the gathering.Hubert Howe Bancroft, The Works of Hubert Howe Bancroft: Volume 29: History of Oregon: Volume 1, 1834-1848. San Francisco, CA: The History Company, 1886; pg. 423. On the following day Judge Matthew Deady was elected the permanent president of the convention. The delegates selected officers, set up rules for the meeting (a total of 45 in all), and divided into committees on various subjects such as military, judicial, legislative, and elections. At the Convention, Chester N. Terry was elected as the secretary of the group, while several people served at different times as the chairperson including Lovejoy, William W. Bristow, Delazon Smith, and La Fayette Grover. The group also settled the debate over a disputed seat at the convention in favor of Perry B. Marple over F. G. Lockhart to represent Coos County. Thirty- four of the delegates were farmers, while 18 were lawyers, including the three justices of the Oregon Supreme Court. Two of the delegates were newspaper editors, five were miners, and another was a civil engineer.Leeson, Fred. Framing the Constitution – 60 men took 32 days to propose Oregon’s legal foundation. The Oregonian, March 26, 2004. The main debates concerning a constitution revolved around slavery and the exclusion of Blacks, liquor laws, and what would be the boundaries of the new state. After meeting for 31 days, the convention ended on September 18, when the delegates voted to approve the document as the constitution.Information The 1857 Oregon Constitutional Convention. Oregon State Archives. Retrieved on March 2, 2008. The final tally was 35 votes for passage and 10 against; 15 members of the convention were absent and did not vote. Draft Constitution The document approved by the convention was modeled after Indiana's 1851 Constitution and included a provision that denied the right to vote to \\"negro, Chinaman or mulatto\\" citizens in the state to be, and though female suffrage was discussed, women were also denied the right to vote, as was typical of the era. Provision was made for the ability of the legislature to regulate the immigration into the state of \\"persons not qualified to become citizens of the United States,\\" thereby allowing legislative restriction of the number of free blacks coming into the state in the event that an outright ban did not achieve majority approval.Bancroft, History of Oregon: Volume 2, pg. 424. Another section forbade any \\"Chinaman\\" who immigrated into the state after adoption of the constitution from ever owning real estate or working a mining claim, expressly giving the legislature power to enforce this provision.Bancroft, History of Oregon: Volume 2, pp. 424-425.

The vote to approve the constitution by the citizens of Oregon was 7,195 for the constitution and 3,215 against the document. The vote on slavery was 2,645 to allow slavery and 7,727 to make it illegal, and the vote to make it illegal for Blacks to live in the state was 8,640 to ban them and 1,081 to allow them to live in the state. All white men over the age of 21 were allowed to vote, and after the passage a delegation was sent east to Washington, D.C. to press for statehood. Oregon then waited on the United States Congress to accept the constitution and approve Oregon for statehood. Due to the ongoing debate over slavery in the country as the nation approached the American Civil War, the U.S. Senate did not pass legislation to bring Oregon into the Union until 1859, when Oregon became the 33rd state on February 14.

Its natural habitats are fast-moving mountain streams and their surroundings. The IUCN lists it as \\"endangered\\". Description The Pyrenean frog is the smallest species of brown frog in Europe, with adults reaching a snout-to-vent length of about , females being slightly larger than males. The snout is blunt and rounded and the nostrils are more widely separated than are the eye bulges. The tympani are small and not always visible and the dorso-lateral folds are fairly close together. The hind feet are completely webbed apart from the tip of the fourth toe. This frog is creamy-brown, buff, greyish- brown, reddish-brown or olive-grey with rather indistinct blotches of greenish-brown or brown. The hind legs are faintly barred. The upper lip is often noticeably pale and the throat and underparts are whitish with the belly sometimes flushed with yellow or pink, especially under the thighs. It differs from the common frog (Rana temporaria) by being smaller, having a less-pointed snout and less-distinct markings. Distribution and habitat The Pyrenean frog is endemic to the Pyrenees with most populations being on the Spanish slopes at altitudes between about . Its range extends from the Ordesa y Monte Perdido National Park to the Roncal Valley in the Navarre region. It is also present in limited numbers on the French side of the mountains. It is found in and around fast-moving, rocky streams with little vegetation, sharing this habitat with the Pyrenean brook salamander (Calotriton asper). It avoids still water ponds and lakes. Behaviour Adult Pyrenean frogs spend much of their time in the fast-flowing rocky streams and torrents near which they live, but juveniles are more terrestrial. The frogs are timid and escape from danger by diving into water and hiding in crevices and under stones. They hibernate in the winter but are active during both day and night between about February and July. Breeding takes place after the snow has melted, the female laying batches of jelly-covered eggs (totalling up to 150) under stones, in crevices or on the bed of a stream. Status The International Union for Conservation of Nature lists the Pyrenean frog as being an \\"endangered species\\". This is because its numbers are decreasing, its total area of occupancy is less than and even within this range, its populations are fragmented. Threats it faces include alteration to its habitat through the intensification of agricultural practices, disturbance from increased tourism, the introduction of non-native fish and possibly climate change.

Born in Freshford, County Kilkenny, Dillon first played competitive hurling in various juvenile grades. He arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of seventeen when he first linked up with the Kilkenny minor team. He made his senior debut in a 1960 tournament game but had to wait until the 1964 championship before he became a regular. Dillon went on to play a key part for Kilkenny during a successful era for the team, and won three All-Ireland medals, six Leinster medals and one National Hurling League medal. Dillon represented the Leinster inter-provincial team on a number of occasions throughout his career, winning Railway Cup medals in 1965 and 1972. At club level he won two championship medals with St. Lachtain's. Cited by many of his hurling peers as one of the best full-backs of his generation, Dillon won two Cú Chulainn. He was later named in the full-back position on the Kilkenny Hurling Team of the Century. Playing career Club Dillon played his club hurling with the St. Lachtain's club in Freshford and enjoyed a very successful under-age career. He first came to prominence on the club's under-14 team that was defeated by Thomastown in the 'B' county final in 1951. Dillons's side built on this success and went on to secure the county under-14 title in 1952. Dillon subsequently joined the St. Lachtain's under-16 team where he enjoyed further success. He added a winners' medal to his collection in this grade in 1954 when the club beat Thomastown by 4–6 to 2–3. In the mid-1950s St. Lachtain's became a major force on the club hurling scene as minor level. Dillon was a key member of this team and lined out in his first county minor decider in 1954. Old rivals Thomastown provided the opposition and went on to defeat St. Lachtain's by 5–1 to 2–1. St. Lachtain's reached the county minor final again in 1955, however, this time Glenmore were the opponents. A huge 8–5 to 4–5 score line gave Dillon's side the victory. In 1956 Dillon was in his final year as a minor as St. Lachtain's aimed to retain their title. The club reached the county final for the third year in succession. Thomastown provided the opposition and went on to secure an 8–4 to 5–3 victory. Three years later in 1959 Dillon was at full back on the St. Lachtain's junior hurling team that contested the county championship final in that grade. Once again it was a Thomastown selection that provided the opposition, however, after facing defeat to their old rivals at under-age levels, Dillon won a county junior championship title following a 4–7 to 4–2 victory. Just two years after winning promotion from the junior grade St. Lachtain's reached the final of the county senior championship. The opponents were Near South, however, St. Lachtain's ability to score goals while conceding none proved decisive in the 4–5 to 0–12 victory. It was Dillon's first senior county championship winners' medal. After surrendering the title the following year, St. Lachtain's reached the championship decider again in 1963. Tullogher provided the opposition, however, they were no match for Dillon's side as a 1–7 to 0–3 score line gave him a second county title. Minor Dillon's success at club level brought him to the attention of the Kilkenny minor hurling selectors and he joined the team in 1955. That year he won a Leinster in the minor grade as Wexford were accounted for after a draw and a replay. Kilkenny were later beaten by Galway in the All-Ireland semi- final. In 1956 Dillon added a second Leinster minor winners' medal to his collection as Wexford were defeated in the provincial decider once again. This victory allowed Kilkenny advance to the All-Ireland final where Tipperary were waiting. An absolute rout took place as Tipp won the game by 4–16 to 1–5. Senior Dillon's first senior outing in a Kilkenny jersey was against Waterford in a tournament game in 1960, however, it took him another few years to gain a permanent foothold in the county team. Jim 'Link Walsh was the regular full-back at the time while 'Cha' Whelan of Thomastown held the position for the 1963 championship. By 1964 Dillon had taken over the position and became the first-choice number three for the majority of the next decade. That year Dillon won his first Leinster winners' medal in the senior grade following a huge win over Dublin. Staunch local rivals Tipperary later provided the opposition in the All-Ireland final, however, Kilkenny were the pundits' favourites to retain the title. Jimmy Doyle had other ideas, however, as he scored 10 points and set up Seán McLoughlin for a goal. Tipperary's fourteen-point winning margin, 5–13 to 2–8, was the biggest All-Ireland final win since Tipperary had overwhelmed Laois in the 1949 decider. It was a disappointing end to Dillon's debut season, however, he was subsequently presented with the Cú Chulainn award for best full-back of the season. Kilkenny lost their provincial crown in 1965, however, Kilkenny bounced back in 1966 with Dillon collecting his first National Hurling League winners' medal and a second Leinster title. Dillon had been redeployed to the full- forward position for the season, however, the move proved short-lived. The provincial victory allowed Kilkenny to advance directly to the All-Ireland final where arch-rivals Cork provided the opposition. It was the first meeting of these two great sides since 1947 and 'the Cats' were installed as the firm favourites. In spite of this two goals by Colm Sheehan and a third from John O'Halloran gave Cork a merited 3–9 to 1–10 victory over an Eddie Keher- inspired Kilkenny. For the second time in three years Dillon found himself on the losing side on All-Ireland final day. The following year Kilkenny continued their provincial dominance with Dillon picking up a third Leinster title before lining out in a third All-Ireland final at Croke Park. Tipperary were Kilkenny's opponents on the day, however, by this stage Tipp's pool of players was ageing and the county's hurling fortunes were in decline. Kilkenny proved more than a match for the Munster champions. Goals from Paddy Moran, Martin Brennan and Tom Walsh at vital times laid to rest a bogey that Tipperary had over Kilkenny since 1922. A 3–8 to 2–7 score line gave Dillon his first All-Ireland winners' medal. He later collected a second Cú Chulainn award. Wexford put an end to Kilkenny's hopes of retaining the title in 1968, however, the Noresiders bounced back the following year with Dillon collecting a fourth Leinster medal. Cork faced Kilkenny in the subsequent All-Ireland final and revenge for 1966 was foremost in the minds of the Kilkenny team. For a while it looked as if the Leesiders would triumph over their great rivals once again, however, five points from Kilkenny in the last seven minutes gave Dillon a second All-Ireland winners' medal. Kilkenny lost their provincial and All-Ireland titles in 1970, however, 1971 saw Dillon capture a fifth provincial winners' medal as Kilkenny began to assert their dominance over Wexford. The Leinster champions later played Tipperary in the only eighty- minute final between these great rivals. The game has gone down in All-Ireland final folklore for a number of reasons. As the first All-Ireland final to be broadcast in colour by Telefís Éireann, the nation saw Eddie Keher score a remarkable 2–11 and still end up on the losing side. Kilkenny's ever- dependable goalkeeper, Ollie Walsh, had a nightmare of a game in which he conceded five goals, one of which passed through his legs, while that year's Hurler of the Year, Michael 'Babs' Keating, played out the closing stages of the game in his bare feet. After a thrilling game Tipp emerged the victors on a score line of 5–17 to 5–14. In 1972 Keher won a seventh Leinster title following a victory over Wexford in a replay of the provincial final. Once again, Cork provided the opposition in the All-Ireland final, a game which is often considered to be one of the classic games of the modern era. Halfway through the second-half Cork were on form and stretched their lead to eight points. Drastic action was required and Kilkenny's star forward Eddie Keher was deployed closer to the Cork goal. He finished the game with a tally of 2–9 as 'the Cats' powered to a 3–24 to 5–11 victory. It was Dillon's fourth All- Ireland winners' medal.

As its common name suggests, it prefers aquatic environments. The Albanian water frog is an endangered species and known populations are currently in decline. Significant threats to its habitat are presented by pollution and by drainage of wetlands, and a more direct threat is the aggressive collection of the species for commercial purposes. The frogs are medium-sized and males sometimes bear a distinctive bright green stripe down the length of the backbone. Otherwise males are green to light brown in overall colouring with large black or dark brown spots. Females are olive green or light brown in colour and also bear brown or black large spots. As befits a species that prefers wetland habitats, the webbing on the feet extends to the tips of the toes. Taxonomy Pelophylax shqipericus was first described in 1987 under the name Rana shqiperica in the Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. The specific epithet shqipericus comes from Shqipëria, the Albanian word for Albania. Many species that were once included in the genus Rana were moved to separate genera at the beginning of the 21st century, when detailed molecular phylogenetic data made a distinction among the species more clear. P. shqipericus is one such species transferred from Rana to Pelophylax on the strength of the new DNA sequencing data. Distribution and habitat The Albanian water frog is endemic to the Balkans and primarily found only in western Albania and southern Montenegro, where it inhabits freshwater marshes, swamps, ditches, and the heavily vegetated shorelines of lakes and rivers. The northernmost part of its range is Lake Skadar, where its presence is significantly threatened by over-collection. Morphology Male Albanian water frogs are generally about long and colouration on the dorsal side is green to light brown. They bear large brown or black spots and sometimes also have a bright green vertebral stripe. The spots disappear or are much fainter during the breeding season, and dorsal colouration changes to olive or grass green. Their vocal sacs are only lightly pigmented, greyish or green. Females are larger with a mean size of about 74 mm, are light brown to olive green, and are also dorsally spotted. On the underside, yellow colouration is present around the groin, sometimes extending to the hind legs and the belly. The belly of females is usually cream and unspotted. Like many water frogs, P. shqipericus has entirely webbed feet, with the webbing extending to the tips of the toes. Both males and females utter a distress call that lasts several seconds. The male advertising call does not have discrete pulse groups. Conservation status Pelophylax shqipericus was first added as an endangered species to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species in 2004, where it has remained since. Populations in Albania and Montenegro are diminishing due to a variety of factors. Fragmentation of its habitat is occurring as wetlands are drained for infrastructure and farming, and the quality of its remaining habitat is declining through pollution from agricultural and industrial run-off. Although Lake Skadar is a protected site on both the Albanian and Montenegrin sides and recognised as an important wetland by the Ramsar Convention, there is still a significant amount of collection of amphibians that occurs at the lake for the pet trade and the food industry. This practice reduces the population but also introduces fatal diseases, such as chytridiomycosis, and non-native frogs to the region. Breeding and larval development of offspring rely on the aquatic nature of its habitat. It is not known how well the Albanian water frog will adapt to the threats and changes in its environment.

It is endemic to the islands of Amami Ōshima and Kakeromajima in the Ryukyu Islands, Japan. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests, freshwater marshes, and intermittent freshwater marshes. Once considered a delicacy as a source of food, it is now threatened by habitat loss through deforestation, and predation by introduced mongooses. It is one of only two species (the other being Babina holsti) to possess a \\"pseudothumb\\" on the forelimbs.  Physiology and morphology  The Otton frog has been denoted the 'wolverine frog' due to hidden retractable claws, which are sharp and shoot out from under their thumbs. Both male and female Otton frogs have these claws, with male claws being typically longer than those of the females. Like the five-fingered Hypsiboas rosenbergi frogs of Latin America, the Otton frog has five fingers.  Behaviour  This rare frog uses its switch-blade claws to fight and in mating. Although both sexes have claws, apparently only the males use them, probably to anchor the female to the male during mating. During fighting, two male Otton frogs wrestle each other until in an embrace. They then impale their opponent on their retractable spikes.

It is endemic to Ryukyu Archipelago, Japan, and is known from the islands of Ishigaki and Iriomote, both in the Yaeyama Group. The specific name supranarina refers to the large size of this species (Latin supra means \\"beyond\\")—at the time of the species description, it was the largest member of the so-called Rana narina complex. Common name greater tip-nosed frog has been coined for it. Description Adult males measure and adult females in snout–vent length. The body is stout with triangular head; the snout is pointed. The tympanum is distinct. The fingers are unwebbed and have small discs. The toes have well- developed webbing and discs that are slightly larger than the finger discs. The dorsolateral and supratympanic folds are weakly developed. The dorsum is smooth. Dorsal ground colour varies from light brown to greenish brown; there are no distinct markings. There are dark markings below the canthus, around the tympanum, and along the dorsolateral fold. The limbs have dark crossbars. Males have paired subgular vocal sacs. Tadpoles are rather slender and have long, muscular tail. A newly metamorphosed individual measures about in snout–vent length. On both Ishigaki and Iriomote, Odorrana supranarina is sympatric with Odorrana utsunomiyaorum, a \\"dwarf\\" species in relative terms. As O. supranarina is a \\"giant\\" species, it appears that the body sizes of these two species have diverged, perhaps in response to competition. Habitat and conservation Odorrana supranarina inhabits broad-leaved evergreen forests along mountain streams. However, it can also be found in coastal areas, in riverside forests just outside the mangrove. Breeding takes place in October–March in shallow streams and in pools. The eggs are attached to stones or dead leaves under the water. The species has a small and fragmented range. Habitat loss and degradation caused by logging and human settlement are threats to it, particularly on Ishigaki. Iriomote is a national park, but improved protection of its forest habitats is still needed.

It is endemic to Ryukyu Archipelago, Japan, and is known from the islands of Ishigaki and Iriomote, both in the Yaeyama Group. The specific name utsunomiyaorum honours Taeko and Yasuaki Utsunomiya for their contributions to clarifying the amphibian fauna of the Yaeyama Group. Description Adult males measure and adult females in snout–vent length. The body is moderately stout with triangular head. The snout is obtusely pointed in dorsal view but rounded in profile. The tympanum is distinct. The fingers are unwebbed and have small discs. The toes have well-developed webbing and discs that are slightly smaller than the discs of the outer fingers. The dorsolateral fold is weakly developed and supratympanic fold is absent. The dorsum is scattered with numerous tubercles. Dorsal ground colour varies from light brown to greenish brown. The back has some dark blotches. There are dark markings below the canthus, around the tympanum, and along the dorsolateral fold. The limbs have dark, incomplete crossbars. Males have paired subgular vocal sacs. On both Ishigaki and Iriomote, Odorrana utsunomiyaorum is sympatric with Odorrana supranarina, a \\"giant\\" species in relative terms. As O. utsunomiyaorum is a \\"dwarf\\" species, it appears that the body sizes of these two species have undergone divergent evolution, perhaps in response to competition. Habitat and conservation Odorrana utsunomiyaorum inhabits broad-leaved evergreen forests along mountain streams. Where Odorrana supranarina is present, this species tends to occupy smaller streams. Breeding takes place in late February–April in shallow streams. The eggs are attached to stones under the water. The species has a small and fragmented range. Habitat loss and degradation caused by deforestation is a major threat. Iriomote is a national park, but improved protection of its forest habitats is still needed.

Identification Carpenter frogs are distinguished by their all brown color with two yellow stripes on each side of the back. Their tail is gray in color and their underside is normally white or yellow. Unlike other frogs the webbing on their toes does not reach the longest toe. Carpenter frogs are recognized by their call which resembles a carpenter hammering, which gives them their name. They have ectothermic, heterothermic and bilateral symmetry. The frog's throat pouch is spherical shaped when inflated. Full grown frogs are medium-sized 4.1-6.6 centimeters.http://www.conservewildlifenj.org/species/fieldguide/view/Lithobates%20virgatipes/ Habitat The carpenter frog is found in the Atlantic coastal plains in the United States. From the pine barrens of New Jersey to the bottom of Georgia, the carpenter frog makes its home. The frog is also found, but not common, in Florida. They are usually found in water and rarely on land.http://www.virginiaherpetologicalsociety.com/amphibians/frogsandtoads/carpenter- frog/carpenter_frog.php The carpenter frog adapted to be able to live in acidic waters. The frog has been observed in cypress ponds, interdunal swales, tupelo swamps, acid swamps, canals, and is associated with sphagnum mats and other vegetation in coffee-colored waters of pine savanna bogs or ponds. They most commonly are found in relatively acidic water abundant Sphagnum or other vegetation leading to being sometimes referred to \\"sphagnum frogs.\\" They depend on aquatic vegetation in shallow waters for protection and breeding. It is said that carpenter frogs are found in waterways that are tea or coffee colored, where they can easily be camouflaged. Reproduction Carpenter frogs are prolonged breeders with a breeding season between 2–3 months. The breeding season typically occurs with onset of warm weather in late April and continues until late July or early August.Given, M.F. 1987.

Territoriality and Aggressive Interactions of Male Carpenter Frogs, Rana virgatipes. Copeia 1988:411-421. Intensity of the calls varies according to body size, with smaller males having high pitched calls of lower intensity relative to larger males. Calling activity occurs between sunset and sunrise but peaks near midnight. After mating, females lay globular egg masses of 200-600 eggs attached to underwater vegetation up to 8 inches deep.Livezey, R.L. and A.H. Wright. 1947. A Synoptic Key to the Salientian Eggs of the United States. American Midland Naturalist 37:179-222. Life cycle Tadpoles hatch from eggs approximately one week after laying, and remain in this state for approximately 1 year. Between August and September, tadpoles will metamorphose into juvenile frogs. Diet Carpenter frogs eat a majority of aquatic insects and invertebrates such as crayfish and spiders. Threats One of the main reasons that the carpenter frog has become of special concern is due to its susceptibility to habitat loss and degradation.http://srelherp.uga.edu/anurans/ranvir.htm In the 1990s the carpenter frog population in Talbot County was found to be severely decreased as a possible result of habitat degradation. (Given, 1999; White and White, 2002) In South Georgia the Carpenter Frog is considered a common species although it has a limited range. Considering that the Carpenter Frog requires wetland areas with large amounts of submerged vegetation for breeding, human disturbances, such as ditching and urbanization, to such environments have and will continue to impact the species. (\\"Conservation Plans for Biotic Regions in Florida Containing Multiple Rare or Declining Wildlife Taxa\\", 2003) Because it is known to thrive in acidic waters, throughout time the neutralization of water, specifically in the Delmarva region, has had a great impact on its decline in population because they are unable to adapt. As wetlands become less acidic, it becomes a new habitat for a larger variety of frogs and other species that can thrive in these conditions. It is suggested that predation also plays a role in the decline of their population. These larger frogs include more aggressive species such as northern green frogs which can potentially be a great threat to the carpenter frog. The presence of American Bullfrogs (Lithobates catesbeianus) and Pig Frogs (Lithobates grylio) have also negatively affected the species. Apart from other frogs becoming a threat to the carpenter frog, some research suggests that water snakes (Nerodia) also prey on the carpenter frog.

Conflicting church traditions place him possibly as early as the 10th century or as late as the 14th. His feast day is celebrated on June 28.Great Synaxaristes: Οἱ Ὅσιοι Σέργιος καὶ Γερμανός. 28 Ιουνίου. ΜΕΓΑΣ ΣΥΝΑΞΑΡΙΣΤΗΣ. Church legends about St. Sergius of Valaam were not committed to writing until the 18th century. In these writings, Sergius is described as an Athonite monk sent by the Byzantine Emperor to enlighten the heathen tribes of Karelia with the light of the Christian faith. He traveled along the trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks, passing the Rus' towns of Kiev, Novgorod and Staraya Ladoga. He arrived on the northern shores of Lake Ladoga, and soon moved to Valaam island, where he would spend the rest of his life preaching. A tradition placing his arrival on Valaam as early as 992 would make him a contemporary of Emperor Basil II. Another pious legend describes Sergius as a disciple of Apostle Andrew who reportedly visited Crimea in the 1st century AD. However, the earliest record of this saint's activity claims that he arrived in Valaam in 1329.Святые His work was carried on by, among others, Herman of Valaam, who may or may not have a contemporary of Sergius. Saints Sergius and Herman are considered the founders of the Valaam Monastery. Yet another church tradition dates his death to 1353, but there are no medieval documents to validate this claim either.Преподобные Сергий и Герман Валаамские + Православный Церковный календарь The archaeological record places the arrival of Christianity in Finland at the 10th or 11th centuries. The date of the monastery's foundation is not clear, as all records of its early history have been destroyed, most of them in the Russo-Swedish Wars. According to an 18th-century church chronicle, the relics of Sergius and Herman were moved to safety in Novgorod in 1162 (or 1163), possibly before a major Swedish offensive against Staraya Ladoga,.

Larger in scale than the Dallas Fan Days events under the same management, Fan Expo Dallas focuses on comic book artists, writers, and publishers. These events usually also feature question and answer sessions, a large dealers room, and a number of comics and media guests signing autographs. The event, previously known as Dallas Comic Con (or DCC for short), is produced by Informa Canada Inc. doing business as Fan Expo HQ.  History  In 2002, Ben Stevens, producer of the Sci-Fi Expo (1994–present), and Philip Wise, owner of rebelscum.com and theforce.net, brought on consultant Mark Walters (of the defunct Dallas Fantasy Fair, who had staged the Dallas Comic & Toy Fest from 2000 to 2002) and produced the first Dallas Comic Con. The show attracted 5,000 attendees. Starting with the October 2012 show, Dallas Comic Con expanded to three days. C2 Ventures sold control of Dallas Comic Con, Sci-Fi Expo, and Fan Days to Informa in early 2014. There was no expo in 2020 caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.  Locations  To date, the Dallas Comic Con has been held at one of four locations. The first three locations were in suburbs of Dallas, Texas. Early editions were held at the Plano Centre in Plano, Texas, or the Richardson Civic Center in Richardson, Texas. Beginning in May 2011, the event relocated to the Irving Convention Center at Las Colinas in Irving, Texas. In May 2014, the Dallas Comic Con relocated to the Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center in downtown Dallas. Dallas Fan Days events remain at the Irving Convention Center.

It is widespread on Borneo. Description Its snout-vent length is in males and in females. It has a markedly slender head with a pointed snout and a rather short fourth finger, distinguishing it from its relatives. Its vomer lacks teeth, and it has a lingual papilla. The eggs are unpigmented. (2007): Resurrection of Staurois parvus from S. tuberilinguis from Borneo (Amphibia, Ranidae). Zool. Sci. 24(1): 101–106. Distribution It is found in northern Borneo in Sabah and Sarawak (Malaysia), Brunei, and northeastern Kalimantan (Indonesia) to asl. A smaller relative, only known from the Crocker Range in Sabah (Malaysia), was described as Staurois parvus. Later, it was considered a junior synonym of S. tuberilinguis, but more recently it was confirmed to be distinct according to morphological and DNA sequence data. Habitat and ecology This frog is diurnal and crepuscular and it is commonly found along the banks of small, rocky streams with clear water in primary rainforests. They can often be seen perched on rocks or other vegetation near water, usually around the rapids. They breed in streams and the males vocalize during the day. Like other members of Staurois, they use visual signalling to attract a mate.Amphibians and Reptiles of Mount Kinabalu (North Borneo), R. Malkmus, U. Manthey, G. Vogel, P. Hoffmann and J. Kosuch. 2002. A.R.G . Gantner Verlag Kommanditgesellschaft, FL 9491 Ruggell Conservation and threats Deforestation by logging of forests and subsequent sedimentation and alteration of stream conditions are the primary threats to this species. It can be locally very common along streams but is declining in abundance. This species is found in Mt. Kinabalu and Gunung Mulu National Parks which are well protected. However, the mountains in Kalimantan need urgent and increased protection.

It is endemic to South Africa. Description The banded stream frog is a slender streamlined frog with a long pointed snout and long hind legs where the distance from the ankle to the knee is greater than half the length of the body. When the frog is sitting the fourth toe on the hind foot extends past the front foot. The dorsal skinis pale but is marked with brown, gold, grey, and sometimes red to orange stripes running along the body while the legs have bands which run across them. The anterior skin is smooth and white. Distribution The banded stream frog is endemic to South Africa, and is almost endemic to the Western Cape but its distribution just extends into the western Eastern Cape. It range extends from extending the Cape Peninsula north into the Cederberg Mountains, and east as far as Witelsbos Forest Reserve in the Tsitsikamma Mountains. Habitat The banded stream frog typically inhabits montane fynbos but it occasionally occurs on the margins of exotic pine forest where this has been planted over fynbos. It prefers flat, open situations near streams and tends to avoid steep slopes and deep valleys. It is found in regions where the annual rainfall exceeds 500mm. For breeding it uses well vegetated shallow seasonal marshy areas and seepages, with long grass, restios, or infrequently, ferns. Habits The banded stream is mainly a winter breeder, .i.e. May to August, but if its is wet enough the males also call in spring or late summer. The normal calling position is a crouched position on the ground near water below marginal overhanging vegetation, and also from 10–20 cm above the ground, gripping grass stems and in a spread eagle posture. The banded stream frog may occasionally form dense breeding choruses early in the breeding season when there are ideal conditions, however, the advertisement calls are usually individual as the calling males are scattered and situated apart from one each other. The males may call at any time during the day or night, but mostly around sunset. The banded stream frog lays its eggs out of the water on waterlogged soil or in moss at the base of tussocks of vegetation, the eggs are laid within about 5–20 cm of temporary pools or shallow streams of water emanating from seepages. The clutch size varies from 34 to 104 eggs and they are laid singly but the females may scatter them or she may group them in clusters, or deposit them in rows of up to six or seven. The tadpoles that develop from the eggs are benthic and they complete their metamorphosis in water. Conservation Although the banded stream frog is listed as least concern it is threatened by habitat loss caused by invasive alien vegetation, forestry, wildflower farming, artificial drainage, fires and development. Much of the banded stream frog's habitat is in protected areas. Etymology The binomial name refers to the Cape of Good Hope , meaning \\"bonaespei\\" being Latin for \\"good hope\\".

It is endemic to southern Africa. Description Strongylopus fasciatus is a small, long legged frog with a pointed snout. Its distinguishing features are the parallel yellow and brown longitudinal stripes along its back, with longitudinal dark stripes along its legs. It has a white belly and the males have yellow throats. The pupil is horizontal. Has very long toes and when crouched the fourth toe on the rear feet extends past the front feet. Voice The call of Strongylopus fasciatus is a sharp \\"pip\\" which can be made singly or in a series of three or four calls. Distribution Strongylopus fasciatus occurs the Western Cape Province east through eastern South Africa to borders of Lesotho and Swaziland, then north into Zimbabwe, western Mozambique and south- western Zambia, its presence in Botswana has yet to be confirmed. In the Highveld of central South Africa it appears to be localised but extends as far west as the eastern Orange Free State. Habitat Strongylopus fasciatuscan be found in a variety of habitats from grassland to forest in areas with an annual rainfall of more than 500mm and is rarely found far from permanent water. In the montane grasslands of South Africa the preferred breeding habitat is grassy streamsides, reed beds along the margins of rivers and vleis. It is tolerant of human disturbance and can be found in irrigation canals, reservoirs, parks and gardens. Habits Strongylopus fasciatus breeds mainly in the southern winter, and breeding seems to be triggered by the dropping in temperature. The males' first calls are usually recorded in mid- to late February, although they have been heard as early as January. The peak calling period appears to be in March, April and May, and calling stops by November. In summer, sporadic calling may be set off by a cold front moving in from the south. Males call from the water's edge or from elevated positions in reeds and grass. Where they are less common the males may be scattered and call individually but where they are abundant they may form choruses and the males be separated by only a few centimetres. The female lays the eggs singly in shallow water on the margins of grassy waterbodies. The eggs are soon camouflaged as debris sticks to them, making them difficult to see. Clutch size has not been recorded but comparusons with related species suggest that Strongylopus fasciatus does not lay large clutches. The tadpoles metamorphose into froglets after 4–5 months. Conservation Strongylopus fasciatus is a widespread and common species and is not threatened. However, specimens of this species caught in Kenton on Sea in 2004 tested positive for the fungus that causes chytridiomycosis.

Outside the breeding season, it can be found far from water. During the breeding season, males call from flooded grass. The egg clusters are laid just above streams, underneath dense vegetation. Tadpoles develop in the streams. Strongylopus fuelleborni is a common species, but its montane grassland habitats are threatened in parts of its range because of afforestation, overgrazing, agriculture, human settlement, and spread invasive trees such as eucalyptus.

H.; Carruthers, Vincent. A Complete Guide to the Frogs of Southern Africa. Cape Town, South Africa: Struik Nature. 2009Carruthers, Vincent. Frogs and Frogging in Southern Africa. Struik Nature. 2001. , It is a ground dweller, living mainly in vegetation such as sedges, generally brown, slenderly built and agile, with long, practically unwebbed toes. Description Strongylopus grayii is a fairly small species (snout-to- vent length of breeding specimens about 25 to 50 mm). The snout is not as pointed as most of the genus, the snout profile being rather reminiscent of the Cape river frog. The ventral skin is smooth, pale to white, the dorsal skin colour is variable, generally shades of brown with darker blotches. Similar blotches form bars across the upper surfaces of the thighs. Often it has a vertebral line in a lightly contrasting colour, pale to reddish. Some colour variants have a broad russet band down the back. The dorsal skin is textured with scattered small, raised ridges, largely longitudinal. The tympanum is smaller in diameter than the eye, but more than half the diameter. Though clearly visible, it is inconspicuous, being situated in a dark facial band of pigment behind the eye. The facial band extends more or less from the nostril, across the lower part of the eye, rearward over the tympanum, to the base of the fore leg. From below the eye, a pale line runs below the facial band to the shoulder. Above the band a light line runs from the snout, across the eye, above the pupil, rearward to the shoulder. Sexual dimorphism is slight, with the male having golden coloration on the lower jaw. The toes are well developed and unwebbed, or nearly so, on all four feet. The front toes are slim and roughly as long as the fore legs are thick. The rear toes are long, with the longest (fourth) toe extending forward roughly as far as the front toes when the frog is squatting. Range and habitat The species occurs in Lesotho, South Africa, Swaziland, and possibly Botswana and parts of Namibia. It has an introduced population on the remote Atlantic island of Saint Helena. It is a common species. Gray's stream frog occurs in a wide range of habitats, being only absent from arid areas: it is found in forests, fynbos heathland, thickets, savanna and grassland, as well as modified habitats. Breeding takes place in almost any shallow vegetated body of water. Habits Gray's stream frog is locally common where conditions are favourable, such as among grassy or scrubby vegetation around streams and dams, or where there is seasonal water such as roadside ponds or vleis. In the breeding season, its voice is an inoffensive musical click, rather like a drop of water falling into a pond, but when a large chorus is active, such as in sedge around a dam, the effect is like a loud, continuous rattle. Though the males mainly sing in chorus at night, they may call at any time of the day from concealment, particularly in cloudy weather. Like most frogs, the species breeds in standing water and the adults take to the water if alarmed. They can swim rapidly and with agility, but if they are unable to leave the water, they die within a few hours. Rather than simple drowning, the cause of death seems be absorption of too much water through the skin.

It is found in the Drakensberg Mountains and Lesotho Highlands in northeastern Lesotho and adjacent South Africa. This species has many common names: Phofung river frog, Berg stream frog, Drakensberg river frog, Natal Drakensberg frog, Drakensberg frog, and Drakensberg rana. Description The maximum reported size for this species is in snout–urostyle length. In a smaller sample, the largest male was and the largest female was in snout–urostyle length. The back is very warty but there are no longitudinal skin ridges; a white glandular ridge runs from below the eye to the arm insertion. The tympanum is dark. The lips are marbled. The gular region is speckled or mottled while the belly is immaculate. There are two common dorsal patterns. One pattern is characterized by a pale background with olive markings; there are two dark \\"V\\" markings; a backward-facing one between the eyes, and another, forward-facing one at the level of the pectoral girdle. There is a white or grey, slightly elongated blotch located on the midline within this mark. The other pattern consists of a brown background with dark brown markings. The warts are slightly paler, and there is a pale patch on the midline, just behind the pectoral girdle. Habitat and conservation Amietia hymenopus inhabit high-altitude riverine grasslands at elevations of above sea level. Adults may be observed basking on rocks. Breeding takes place throughout the year in seepage areas on rocky stream banks or near the edges of pools. The eggs are laid in water. Tadpoles can be active even under ice.

It is endemic to Tanzania and only known from a narrow alpine range on the middle slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro, within the East African montane moorlands ecoregion. It is known only from three specimens collected in 1936. The lack of recent records is probably a reflection of very limited survey effort in the area since then. Description Three adult males in the type series measure in snout–vent length. The body is stocky. The snout is short. The tympanum is visible. There is a pronounced, light vertebral band, containing an inner pair of darker, somewhat irregular and discontinuous longitudinal stripes. The border of the light band coincides with discontinuous skin ridges. The rest of the remainder of the dorsum is brown with sparse darker mottling. There is also a dark lateral line, running over the loreal region, continuing as a narrow strip below the eye, expanding behind the eye to cover the tympanic area, and continuing a very irregular dark band on the flanks. The fingers have fringes but no webbing. The toes are extremely elongated, albeit relatively short compared to other Strongylopus. The toes have some basal webbing.

In 1968, drummer Jasper Guarino helped Perkins land a steady job as a session guitarist in a studio owned by Quin Ivy called \\"Quinvy's\\" in Muscle Shoals. Perkins was salaried at $100 a week. This led to work at Muscle Shoals Sound Studio with such names as David Porter and the Soul Children, Dave Crawford and Brad Shapiro, Dee Dee Warwick, Ronnie Milsap, Joe Cocker, Leon Russell, Jimmy Cliff, Jim Capaldi, Steve Winwood and Marlin Greene. Perkins also provided lead guitar overdubs on three tracks on Catch a Fire, the 1973 album by Bob Marley and the Wailers: \\"Concrete Jungle,\\" \\"Stir It Up,\\" and \\"Baby We’ve Got a Date.\\" \\"His contributions to the pioneering LP weren’t actually mentioned on the original liner notes — indeed most listeners assumed they were hearing Peter Tosh — but Perkins received credit later.\\" Perkins left session work to form a band called Smith, Perkins and Smith which recorded two albums and toured in England on the same bill with Free, Fairport Convention, Argent, Uriah Heep, Family and Vinegar Joe with Robert Palmer. While in Kingston in the Island Basing Street recording studios Perkins had been working on a second Smith Perkins Smith album for Island when Chris Blackwell stopped him. \\"He said there was a Wailer project he wanted me to play on\\" - the Wailers' album \\"Catch a Fire\\", which went platinum.The Stories Behind Every Bob Marley Song 1962-1981 Soul Rebel Maureen Sheridan When Perkins returned to the United States, he played with Leon Russell for two years, in the Gap Band and the Shelter People Band, and with Eric Clapton and Lynyrd Skynyrd. Clapton arranged for Perkins to audition with The Rolling Stones. As a result, Perkins was hired to play lead guitar on the album Black and Blue. The credits for the album list Perkins appearing on three tracks: \\"Hand of Fate\\", \\"Memory Motel\\" and \\"Fool to Cry\\". Following this, Perkins joined the Alabama Power Band (formed by his brother Dale), which became Crimson Tide and recorded two albums. In Nashville, Perkins wrote music for Catdaddy Music and co-wrote soundtracks with Emmy Award winning composer/producer/remixer Richard Wolf for films including The Karate Kid Part II and Back to School. Perkins later formed the band Problem Child with Robert Nix and Rick Christian, and played bass with Lonnie Mack. During his long career, Perkins played session guitar with artists including the Alabama State Troupers, Ben Atkins, Michael Bolton, Angela Bofill, the Everly Brothers, the Oak Ridge Boys, Billy Ray Cyrus, Ray Reach and many others. In 1995, Perkins recorded his first solo album, Mendo Hotel, and in 2005, he released his latest, Ramblin' Heart. Some time later, Wayne Perkins was diagnosed with multiple brain tumors. He was treated, but occasionally suffers from crippling head aches. He retired to Argo, where he lives with his brother.\\" Discography *1971 Hills of Indiana Lonnie Mack ; Living by the Days Don Nix ; Lovejoy Albert King; Mary Called Jeanie Greene; Ronnie Milsap Ronnie Milsap *1972 Alabama State Troupers Road Show Alabama State Troupers; Dinnertime Alex Taylor; Catch a Fire Bob Marley & The Wailers; John David Souther John David Souther; Raised on Records P.F.

History  Formation and debut Tim Bluhm (vocals/guitar), Greg Loiacono (guitar/vocals), Isaac Parsons (bass) and Mike Wofchuck (drums) met in 1990 while attending California State University-Chico, living off campus in Bradley Hall. They jammed and played some original songs at a few parties (once billed as Pippi Longstocking and the Trunk-of-Funk), but soon Isaac and Mike were lured away by the prospect of playing Led Zeppelin and Jane's Addiction covers at big parties as the rhythm section of the Keystones. Meanwhile, Tim and Greg played acoustic guitars and sang harmonies to songstress Ali Weiss in the mellow trio Ali and the Cats. These bands played throughout 1990, but in early 1991, Tim, Greg, Isaac and Mike got back together and got serious about being a rock band. It didn't take long to step up from parties in Chico, CA to local bars and dance clubs like LaSalles and Juanita's. They began playing original songs rather than covers. The band released Back to the Grotto in February 1993. It was produced by the band with Bay Area-based musician/producer Paul Hoaglin (who would subsequently replace Parsons on bass upon his departure in 2002). Major label The Hips were courted by major record labels and did sign a deal with MCA. A&R; Exec. Rob Kasino signed them to Rick Rubin's American Recordings even though they were still students at Chico. The Hips then became labelmates with Johnny Cash, Tom Petty, and the Black Crowes (whose Chris Robinson helped the band to sign with American.) The band visited The Black Crowes at Conway while they were recording Amorica on their way to SXSW. They did more recording and mixing on Back to the Grotto for its American re-release (March 1995) and set out to record a follow-up. Released in August 1995, Part-Timer Goes Full included new songs as well as tunes from their back catalog. American Recordings decided the song \\"Shut the Door\\" would be released as the first single, but this decision did not go over well with some fans, who thought the song was not representative of their sound. While the song didn't top any charts, the fanbase grew due to touring, including a concert at the Silver Dollar Fairgrounds with 2,400 tickets sold. They were also headlining major venues like the Fillmore in San Francisco and appearing at festivals like Laguna Seca Daze and the HORDE tour. Their third album Shootout was recorded in early 1996 and released in October of that year. American Records failed to promote the album and eventually dropped the band from their roster. Changes and later days Their music shifted direction around 1997, with shorter, radio- friendly songs, instead of longer multiple sectioned songs. They started to get into basic country-style songwriting, but it didn't fit with drummer Mike Wofchuck's style, so they replaced him with John Hofer, formerly of The Freewheelers. In 1996, the band members moved out of the Chestnut Street house in Chico, to the San Francisco Bay Area, where they are currently based. They recorded the stripped-down Later Days album and self-released it in May 1998. They continued playing frequently, focusing mostly on California cities, with occasional jaunts to Utah or the Pacific Northwest. They self-recorded another album, the more pop-oriented Green Hills of Earth. Indie label Future Farmer liked the album and released it, but, again, the album did not promote the band to their desired popularity. Bassist Isaac Parsons left the band in March 2002, to spend more time with his son. He was replaced by Paul Hoaglin (co- producer of Back To The Grotto and Part Timer Goes Full). In September 2002, Greg Loiacono, lead guitarist, decided he too needed a break, and the band went on indefinite hiatus after two shows at Slim's in San Francisco in February 2003. Hiatus During the hiatus, Tim Bluhm was the most active musically. He enlisted the Southern California band Five Foot Tuesday as backup, but played to smaller audiences. Greg also formed a band, the Sensations. Also in 2004 two documentaries about the Mother Hips were completed, Patrick Murphree's Stories We Could Tell, a detailing of the history of the Mother Hips, told by the Hips themselves, friends, and family, and Bill DeBlonk's This is the Sound, a compilation of footage from the band's entire career. (A third movie followed in 2006, Dave Schwartz's chronicle of a 2003 Santa Cruz show, Beauty Rock.) Post-hiatus Toward the end of 2004 the Mother Hips reunited and started playing shows again. They recorded an EP, Red Tandy, followed by a full-length album, Kiss the Crystal Flake, released in April 2007. The song \\"Time We Had\\" from the album was in November 2007 featured in the music video game Rock Band, and two songs, \\"Red Tandy\\" and \\"Time Sick Son of a Grizzly Bear\\" were made available as Downloadable Content for the game on the week of April 29, 2008. The band released their seventh album, Pacific Dust, in October 2009 to great acclaim, including highlights \\"White Falcon Fuzz\\" and \\"Third Floor Story\\". The album was recorded at Mission Bells Studio in San Francisco with co-producer/engineer David Simon-Baker. Bassist Hoaglin, who had experienced long-term severe depression and anxiety, and who had become increasingly unenthusiastic, was fired from the band in late February 2011, and temporarily replaced by former Frank Zappa and Fear bassist Scott Thunes. Hoaglin was asked to complete the remaining backing tracks for the group's next album, Behind Beyond, in August 2011, and contributed various additional overdubs from home. Hoaglin has subsequently retired permanently from music, due to physical and mental illnesses. In an interview in Relix magazine in September 2013, Bluhm incorrectly asserted that Hoaglin quit the band. The Mother Hips released an archival 4-CD set compilation celebrating 20 years of music together September 13, 2011 called Days of Sun and Grass. On May 14, 2013, the band announced that their new album, 'Behind Beyond' would be released on July 9, 2013.http://www.jambands.com/news/2013/05/14/mother-hips-to-release-new-album- in-july Jambands.com - Need We Say More? > News > Mother Hips to Release New Album in July A new song, 'Freed From a Prison' was made available for streaming on SoundCloud.https://soundcloud.com/camera-records/mother-hips- freed-from-a MHips's stream on SoundCloud The album was produced by David Simon-Baker and recorded at the Mission Bells studio in San Francisco and will also include the songs, 'Isle Not of Man' and 'Jefferson Army'.http://www.motherhips.com/ MotherHips.com - New Studio Album, Behind Beyond, Out July 9, 2013 In 2017 the band signed with Blue Rose Music.

It is found in central to north-western Namibia and southwestern Angola. Description Five adult males in the type series measure in snout–vent length; the range in a larger sample is . The body is stout. The snout is rounded. The tympanum is round; the supra-tympanic ridge is weakly developed. The fingers have no webbing but the toes are partially webbed. The dorsum is reddish brown with darker brown patches. The eyelids have three darker bars. The shanks and feet are brown with darker patches. The lower surfaces are whitish except for the throat that is darkly pigmented around jaw line. The male advertisement call is a series of notes, emitted at a rate of seven per second. The call has two harmonics that are equally emphasized, one of 1.1–1.2 kHz and the other of 2.4–2.5 kHz. The call is similar to that of Tomopterna tandyi but has higher repeat rate and two instead of one emphasized harmonics. Habitat and conservation The type series was collected from pools in a riverbed. Later on, Tomopterna ahli have been found in a range of dry, sandy habitats near permanent water; it appears that it needs access to permanent water bodies. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as \\"data deficient\\" because of uncertainty concerning its range and ecological requirements, later research has shown it to be relatively widespread and tolerant of a range of ecological conditions. Large parts of its range enjoys nominal protection in the form of a series of community conservancies in Namibia. In Angola, it occurs in the Iona National Park. The most obvious potential threat to this species is changes in availability of surface water.

It is endemic to western and southern South Africa and occurs in the low-lying areas of Namaqualand, Western Cape, and Eastern Cape as far east as Cape St. Francis. Etymology The specific name delalandii honours Pierre Antoine Delalande, a French explorer and naturalist who collected in the Cape area in 1818. Description Tomopterna delalandii is a robust- bodied species with toad-like appearance and gait. Females can reach in snout–vent length. The head is broad and the eyes are large and bulging. The legs are relatively short. There are no finger or toe discs but the toes have some webbing. The upper parts vary in colouration from light grey to dark brown, usually with a mottled appearance and a pale patch between the shoulders. There is also usually a pale vertebral stripe, and often a pale stripe on either side of the body. Males have a dark throat. The male advertisement call is a series of short ringing notes, with about 6–8 notes per second. Habitat and conservation The species occurs in fynbos heath land and succulent karroo shrubland, and it can also live in agricultural land. Breeding takes place in both temporary and semi-permanent bodies of water found in pans, pools, vleis and dams, in flat, sandy areas. It is a very abundant species that occurs in several protected areas. It can be locally threatened by habitat loss caused by the spread of alien vegetation and agricultural and urban expansion.

Design and development The design of the Ba.44 was developed from that of the de Havilland Dragon Rapide, for which Breda had purchased a manufacturing licence. Breda engineers believed that making some changes would better suit the aircraft to the company's manufacturing techniques, the biggest differences in the prototype Ba.44 being the design of the cockpit and empennage, and the change to locally produced Colombo S.63 engines. In production, however, these were changed back to the same de Havilland Gipsy Six engines as the Dragon Rapide. Operational history Four examples were purchased by Ala Littoria, which utilized it on its Albanian routes, while the prototype was sold to the Regia Aeronautica, which deployed it as a VIP transport and air ambulance in Libya. The pleasing performance of the aircraft in this role led to the air force impressing the civil Ba.44s in 1936. The government of Paraguay purchased one Ba.44 for its Military Aviation in 1933 and it was used as an air ambulance/transport in the Chaco War. In 1945, this Ba.44 was transferred to the first Paraguayan Airline, L.A.T.N. (Líneas Aéreas de Transporte Nacional) and was withdrawn from service in 1947. Besides North Africa, the Ba.44s saw service in the Italian campaigns in Albania, Greece, and Yugoslavia.

It is found in southern Angola, Namibia, Botswana, southern Zimbabwe, southern Mozambique, northern South Africa, and Swaziland. This species was discovered during the evening of 23 October 1973 in South Africa's Kruger National Park. Two weeks after heavy rain fell in the area, large numbers were found around the Machayi and Mathlakuza Pans in the northeastern part of the Park near the Mozambican frontier. Description Males measure and females in snout–vent length. It is a stout frog with short, broad head. The fore limbs are also short and stout, whereas the hind limbs are longer than body when extended. Fingers have no webbing whereas the toes have some webbing. The tympanum is present but can be indistinct. The dorsum is typically cream-beige, but may vary from very pale grey-brown to a mid-brown. There are many irregular, khaki-brown markings, outlined with dark-brown to black. There are also bright orange tubercles scattered over entire dorsum, each with a black rim. The venter is immaculate white. Tomopterna krugerensis is not morphologically distinguishable from Tomopterna cryptotis and Tomopterna tandyi, but the male advertisement call is distinct: a slowly repetitive, percussive \\"knock\\" or \\"cluck\\", almost like a metronome.

Polish underground press, devoted to prohibited materials (sl. , lit. semitransparent blotting paper or, alternatively, , lit. second circulation), has a long history of combatting censorship of oppressive regimes in Poland. It existed throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, including under foreign occupation of the country, as well as during the totalitarian rule of the pro-Soviet government. Throughout the Eastern Bloc, bibuła published until the collapse of communism was known also as samizdat (see below). Partitions of Poland In the 19th century in partitioned Poland, many underground newspapers appeared; among the most prominent was the Robotnik, published in over 1,000 copies from 1894. World War II In the Second World War, in occupied Poland there were thousands of underground publications by the Polish Secret State and the Polish resistance. The Tajne Wojskowe Zakłady Wydawnicze (Secret Military Printing Works) was probably the largest underground publisher in the world.Stanisław Salmonowicz, (1994), Polskie Państwo Podziemne (Polish Underground State), Warsaw: Wydawnictwa Szkolne i Pedagogiczne, p. 187. The Home Army Biuletyn Informacyjny reached an estimated circulation of 47,000. Polish People's Republic In the Polish People's Republic during the 1970s and 1980s, several books (sometimes as long as 500 pages) were printed in quantities often exceeding 5,000 copies. In 1980 and 1981, during the short legal existence of Solidarity trade union, actual newspapers were also published. Most of the Polish underground press was organized in the 1970s by the Movement for Defense of Human and Civic Rights (ROPCiO) and Workers' Defence Committee (KOR). Over several years, alongside hundreds of small individual publishers, several large underground publishing houses were created, fueled by supplies smuggled from abroad or stolen from the backrooms of official publishing houses. Throughout the communist era, Poland's Catholic Church and some Christian organizations and groups were allowed to publish a number of periodicals with a certain amount of freedom and a more or less clear anti- communist stand in various periods - but censored. The weekly Tygodnik Powszechny, half openly supporting KOR since 1976 and Solidarity since 1980, and monthly Więż were among the most popular. A news-sheet Solidarność, printed in the Gdansk shipyard during the August 1980 strike, reached a print run of 30,000 copies daily.Colin Barker, The rise of Solidarnosc. International Socialism Quarterly, 17 October 2005. The communist regime then allowed for two legal periodics to be published under the government control and cenzorship, yet with a significant margin of freedom: in January 1981, a regional weekly Jedność in Szczecin, and in May the nationwide weekly Tygodnik Solidarność with Tadeusz Mazowiecki as chief editor and circulation of 500,000. Both newspapers were dependent on the government grants of printing paper, what limited the number of copies. Semi-legal news bulletins were printed by Solidarity and other opposition groups in almost every town, on paper sent as aid by some Scandinavian and Western-European trade unions, without the regime's consent, but for the time being, rarely prosecuted. All that ended December 13, 1981, when gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski imposed a martial law and delegalized Solidarity. The Polish underground press drew on experiences of Second World War veterans of Armia Krajowa and much attention was paid to conspiracy; however, after martial law in Poland and the government crackdown on Solidarity, the activities of underground publishing were significantly curtailed for several years. Nevertheless, with the communist government losing power in the second half of the 1980s, production of Polish underground printing (bibuła) dramatically increased, and many publications were distributed throughout the entire country. After the Revolutions of 1989 some of the underground publishers in Poland transformed into regular and legal publishing houses. There were important differences of scale between Polish underground publishing and the samizdats of the Soviet Union, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and other countries in the Soviet Bloc. In the 1980s, at any given time there were around one hundred independent publishers in Poland who formed an exceptionally vibrant segment of the black market. Books were sold through underground distribution channels to paying customers, including subscribers. Among the few hundred regional periodicals with a usual hand-to-hand circulation of 2,000-5,000, the countrywide \\"Tygodnik Mazowsze\\" weekly reached an average circulation of 60,000 - 80,000 copies, while some issues topped 100,000. The estimated production of books and thick journals can be put close to one thousand per year and more than one million copies. Other products on this market included audio cassettes, videocassettes, posters, postcards, calendars, stamps and buttons. Archiwum Opozycji. Materiały dotyczące oporu wobec władzy komunistycznej (Collected materials of the anti-communist opposition in Poland). Retrieved October 15, 2011. As an indication of how many Poles had access to underground publications in the martial-law decade, 3 of every 4 responders in a research in Kraków by the Niezależne Biuro Badania Opinii Społecznej NSZZ „Solidarność” (Solidarity's Independent Public Opinion Poll Bureau) in 1985 claimed to read it (26% \\"regularly\\", 47% \\"often\\". 22% chose \\"irregular and rare\\", with the remaining 5% declaring \\"never\\". However, this range of influence had to be far more modest in smaller towns and countryside, where few underground grops were active.

It is endemic to central Tanzania where it is widespread. However, because the limits of its distribution are not well-mapped and suitable habitat extends to Kenya, it is possible that its range extends to that country. Common name red sand frog has been coined for it. Description Males measure and females in snout–vent length. The tympanum is visible. The body is robust with short, stocky limbs. The fingers are tapered and have no terminal discs. The hind limbs are short and have reduced webbing. Skin is dorsally smooth but has small flat rounded warts. In breeding individuals, the dorsal colouration is predominantly reddish orange with dark red warts. There is a broad pale tan dorsolateral band that runs from a pale occipital botch behind the eye backwards to the hind limbs. The flanks are speckled with black on white; the ventrum is white. The male advertisement call is a series of notes, with the first harmonic dominant at 1.05–1.17 kHz. The notes are sometimes uttered singly, sometimes together in a regularly spaced series that may have even 11 notes. Habitat and conservation Tomopterna luganga occur in moist and drier savanna habitats at elevations up to above sea level. They require soils suitable for burrowing. Males call along pool edges and from shallow running sandy streams. No significant threats to this species are known. It is known from several protected areas. It is present in the pet trade, but not in numbers that would impact the species.

Early life He was born in Rudolstadt as the son of the reigning Prince of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt, Friedrich Günther, and his second wife, Countess Helene von Raina. She died three days after giving birth to Prince Sizzo and his twin sister, Princess Helene. The mother of Prince Sizzo was the daughter of Prince George Bernhard of Anhalt-Dessau by his morganatic wife, Therese Emma von Erdmannsdorff. Although Prince Sizzo's mother had been adopted by her uncle Prince Wilhelm of Anhalt and given the title of Princess of Anhalt on 1 August 1855 by the reigning Duke of Anhalt-Dessau, the marriage of his parents was still considered morganatic. Because of this, Prince Sizzo was not entitled to use the title of Prince of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt. Instead, he was created Prince of Leutenberg on 21 June 1860. In spite of being denied the use of the title of Prince of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt, Prince Sizzo was granted succession rights to the principality of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt in the event of the extinction of all male dynasts. Although all members of the Rudolstadt branch consented to this, the members of the Sondershausen branch did not, and they also held rights to Rudolstadt.House Laws of Schwarzburg Recognition of rights On 21 April 1896 Prince Sizzo's succession rights were recognised by all members of the House of Schwarzburg. In addition, he was made a full member of the house and able to use the title of Prince of Schwarzburg. Following the agreement, Prince Sizzo became the heir presumptive of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt, ahead of the Sondershausen princes, and third in line to Schwarzburg-Sondershausen behind the reigning prince of Rudolstadt, Prince Günther Victor, who was second and the brother of the reigning prince of Schwarzburg-Sonderhausen, Leopold, who was first. Following the death of Prince Karl Günther of Schwarzburg-Sondershausen on 28 March 1909, the Sondershausen branch became extinct and the Schwarzburg principalities were united in a personal union under Prince Günther Victor of Schwarzburg- Rudolstadt. Therefore, Prince Sizzo became the heir presumptive to the two principalities. However, his chances of succeeding were ended on 22 November 1918, when Prince Günther Victor abdicated following the German revolution, which deposed all of the German monarchs. Following the death of Prince Günther Victor on 16 April 1925, Prince Sizzo succeeded him as head of the House of Schwarzburg. His tenure as head of the house would not last long and less than a year later, Prince Sizzo died in Großharthau with his only son, Prince Friedrich Günther, succeeding him as head of the house and pretender to the Schwarzburg principalities. Marriage and children Prince Sizzo was married to Princess Alexandra of Anhalt (1868–1958) on 25 January 1897 in Dessau.The Peerage, Prince Sizzo Princess Alexandra was the daughter of the reigning Duke of Anhalt, Friedrich I, and his wife Princess Antoinette of Saxe-Altenburg.

It is found in South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, and south- western Angola, and from inland Tanzania and Kenya. It probably occurs more widely within and between these two disjunct areas. The specific name tandyi honours Robert Mills Tandy, an American biologist, herpetologist, and photographer and the collector of the type material. Systematics This species is a tetraploid that probably originated as a hybrid between Tomopterna cryptotis and Tomopterna delalandii. It is not possible to distinguish it morphologically from these two species, and many distributional records do not separate between T. tandyi and T. cryptotis. Description The holotype, an adult male, measures in snout–vent length. The tympanum is visible. The fingers have no webbing whereas the toes are partially webbed. The dorsum has patches of grey or olive on lighter background. The dorsal warts are reddish brown with black marks. Many individuals have a dark interocular bar. The male advertisement call is a series of continuously repeated notes. The call rate is about 7–8 notes per second and the emphasized frequency about 2700–2800 Hz. The call is distinct from T. delalandii and T. cryptotis. Habitat and conservation Tandy's sand frog occurs in dry savanna, bush land, and grassland at elevations below . It can often be found in agricultural areas and is associated with loose sandy soils where pans form. Breeding takes place in ephemeral shallow water, ditches, streams, and dams, after individuals emerge from burrows at the start of the rainy season. The eggs are deposited in pools formed by rainfall, and the tadpoles develop in these. It is an adaptable species that is locally common in parts of its range. It is unlikely to face more than localized threats. It is probably occurs in many protected areas.

It is endemic to Japan where it can be found on Honshu, Kyushu, and Shikoku islands. It is locally threatened by habitat loss caused by dam building and construction of concrete riverbanks. Description As with other species in the family Rhacophoridae, the female is bigger than the male. Males are 3.5–4.4 cm and females are 4.9–8.5 cm. Their bodies are flat which allows them to easily hide between rocks. They are grayish-brown in color with speckles which makes for protective camouflage on rocks. There is a dark T-shaped pattern between their eyes. They are able to change their shade of color to a certain extent based on their surroundings. There isn't much individual variance in color. Suction pads grow on the tips of their fingers and toes. Their eggs are dark brown with a diameter of 0.2 cm. Their mouths are big and have suction pads that allow them to cling onto rocks in a strong current in order to not get carried away. Biology They live in montane streams, lakes, and the surrounding forests. Their diet consists of insects and spiders. The tadpoles eat algae. The male creates a territory on top of a rock on the riverside and does a mating call. The name \\"Kajika\\" (lit. \\"River Deer\\") comes from this cry that sounds like the cry of an \\"Ojika\\" (buck). Around 500 total eggs are laid across multiple sessions in the water, usually underneath a rock, between the months of April and August. The egg sacks are 5 cm in diameter. The eggs hatch after roughly 2 weeks. Relationship with humans Because of their cry they have been the subject of Waka (summer kigo), and in Japanese a person with a beautiful singing voice is referred to as \\"Kajika\\". They are sometimes raised as pets. In the Edo period there were specific \\"Kajika cages\\" that were used to raise them.

Named after Hillsborough County, Florida, she was the only U.S. Naval vessel to bear the name. Originally laid down as USS LST-827 by the Missouri Valley Bridge & Iron Company of Evansville, Indiana on 13 October 1944; launched 22 November; sponsored by Mrs. Clark H. Woodward; and commissioned 12 December with Lieutenant R. L. Olander in command. Service history World War II, 1945 After shakedown off Florida, LST-827 loaded smoke-pots on her tank deck, then departed Mobile, Alabama on 17 January 1945. Following brief stops at the Panama Canal Zone and Pearl Harbor, she arrived at Eniwetok early in March. Sailing for Guam on the 13th, she unloaded her cargo, and for the next two months transported men and equipment between the Marianas and the Philippines. After embarking Marine Fighting Squadron 212 (VMF-212) of Marine Air Group 14 (MAG-14), LST-827 departed San Pedro Bay, Philippines on 24 May en route to Okinawa. When she arrived five days later, American forces were already engaged in a two-month campaign to push the enemy from its Pacific stronghold. After unloading men and equipment, she steamed to the Philippines for additional reinforcements. For the remainder of World War II, LST-827 operated in the vicinity of Okinawa and the Philippines, transporting men and supplies for the final drive to the enemy's homeland. Post-war operations, 1946-1949 Following the Japanese surrender, the landing ship serviced the occupation forces in the Far East until she sailed for the United States on 15 November, arriving San Diego on 16 December. Joining LST Squadron 1 there in May, 1946 she operated along the West Coast performing fleet maneuvers and tactical training exercises for the next three years. LST-827 decommissioned 7 June 1949 at San Diego and joined the Pacific Reserve Fleet. Her respite was brief, however, as President Harry S. Truman met the communist challenge of aggression in Asia by sending U.S. forces to aid the beleaguered South Koreans. Korean War, 1950-1952 Recommissioned on 3 November 1950 with Lieutenant S. G. Ruskey in command, LST-827 departed San Diego on 27 January 1951 for the Far East. After a brief stop at Pearl Harbor, she arrived Yokosuka on 3 March. Assigned to the Korean supply run, she carried supplies from Japan to Pusan, Ulsan, and Inchon for the next four months. LST-827 returned to the United States on 9 August to operate there until early 1952. Departing San Diego on 17 February, she steamed for her second tour in the Western Pacific, touching Pearl Harbor, the Marshall Islands, and the Philippines before arriving Yokosuka on 26 April. From May to October she shuttled supplies and troops between Japan and Korea to strengthen the Allied forces against the threat of Communism. 1952-1958 Departing Japan on 10 October 1952, LST-827 was to perform another historic service to her country by operating with the units assigned to Ivy Mike — the first hydrogen bomb tests. She returned to San Diego on 30 November and received major alterations at Mare Island Naval Shipyard in preparation for her next assignment. From 1953 through 1956, LST-827 sailed on two WestPac cruises, engaged in amphibious exercises off the West Coast and steamed to the Arctic on three occasions to supply stations on the DEW line radar network. This vessel has an appearance in the film The Bridges of Toko Ri (released in 1954) from which flies a rescue helicopter to assist the protagonist (William Holden) after an emergency landing with his F9F Panther On 1 July 1955, all remaining active LSTs were given names of U.S. counties; LST-827 was named USS Hillsborough County (LST-827). During 1957 she participated in exercises off the California coast, and on 1 November was placed in commission, in reserve. Hillsborough County decommissioned on 28 January 1958. Struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 28 March 1958, she was then used as a target and sunk in the Gulf of California on 15 August 1958. LST-827 received one battle star for World War II service and three stars for the Korean War.

Feihyla hansenae occurs in association with riparian vegetation around ponds in lowland forest and up to around above sea level. Reproduction occurs in the rainy season. Egg clutches are deposited on vertical surfaces of boulders and plants above water, occasionally away from water in areas that get subsequently flooded. It is probably threatened by habitat loss (deforestation) occurring in its distribution area. It is present in a number of protected areas.

Description  The Myanmar spotted treefrog is light brown in colour with dark spots on head, back and legs. Its head is round with a pointed, elevated snout and slightly protuberant nostrils. Its vocal sac is external, and it does not have vomerine teeth. Its fingers are opposable and the third finger is the longest and has the largest disk. The webbing between the third and fourth fingers is short, and absent between the other fingers. Males are smaller than females. The snout-to-vent-length of 21 male specimens ranges from and of six female specimens from . Habitat and ecology Individuals were found in disturbed habitat between mountain evergreen forests and agricultural land, 1-2m above the ground in bushes. This species may be restricted to remaining secondary habitat in Rakhine as remnant populations, or (as with other Chirixalus species in Myanmar) they might prefer degraded habitats. Animals were not found in evergreen forests. The eggs are deposited in foam nests, in particular on plants of the genus Arum, hanging over standing water. The larvae presumably develop in the water.

It is found in Angola, Botswana, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe, and possibly the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Somalia. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical dry forest, dry savanna, moist savanna, subtropical or tropical dry shrubland, subtropical or tropical moist shrubland, subtropical or tropical dry lowland grassland, subtropical or tropical seasonally wet or flooded lowland grassland, intermittent freshwater marshes, arable land, pastureland, rural gardens, urban areas, heavily degraded former forests, ponds, and canals and ditches. Description Chiromantis xerampelina are arboreal frogs. Like the other species in genus Chiromantis, they have discs on their toes and their outer two fingers are widely spaced from and nearly at a right angle to their inner two fingers on each hand. They reach up to 90 mm in size. Their skin is slightly bumpy and dry and its colors range between white and brown and change in response to temperature (see adaptations below). They tend to turn white when they die. Behaviour These arboreal frogs do not frequently swim or inhabit water. They are frequently found in and around human settlements where lights, water, and refuse attract many insects. Breeding The grey foam- nest tree frog mates in what is described as the most extreme example of polyandry of all vertebrates. The simultaneous polyandry begins when a female begins releasing eggs onto a tree branch. Up to 12 males then cluster around her and fertilise the eggs by producing sperm which they whip into a foamy 'nest' with their hind legs. The female will leave temporarily to rehydrate before returning to the nest, as the entire ordeal can last several hours. Offspring of these polyandrous encounters are more likely to survive than the eggs fertilised by a single male.Harmonious orgy is winning formula for frogs , Australian Geographic, February 22, 2011. Adaptations As these frogs often live in arid and semi-arid climates, they have developed several adaptations to live months at a time away from water. These include: uricotelism, rectal water resorption, and water-loss resistant skin that changes color in response to temperature. Individual frogs can change their color from chalky white to dark brown. The brown coloration has a geometric/bark pattern. The frogs change their body colors in response to temperature differences in order to maintain a good body temperature and minimize evaporative water loss. When they are dark, their body temperature follows air temperature more closely, it is common for them to do this when the air is below 36 °C. The white coloration helps them to maintain a temperature below the ambient temperature by reflecting heat away. Their skin has an integumentary resistance to evaporation that rivals that of terrestrial reptiles, earning them the nickname of \\"waterproof frogs\\", but this resistance isn't present in their ventral skin, so when met with a dry period, these frogs tuck their water losing ventral areas under them so that only their resistant skin is exposed and the secrete a water-resistant mucus to seal any small gaps and they aestivate.Let Sleeping Frogs Lie, Siyabona Africa (Pty)Ltd, Accessed 18 July 2016. If disturbed and forced to move, they lose a significant amount of water and may not be able to survive the rest of the dry season. References * Poynton, J.C., Schiøtz, A. & Howell, K. 2004.

It is endemic to Taiwan and is commonly known as the temple tree frog. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist shrubland, seasonally wet or flooded lowland grassland, freshwater marshes, intermittent freshwater marshes and irrigated land. It is listed as being of \\"Least Concern\\" by the IUCN although there may be some destruction of its habitat. Description Kurixalus idiootocus is a small tree frog measuring in length with the females usually being larger than the males. The head is broad with a triangular, pointed snout. This frog is some shade of pale or medium brown with a dark- coloured stripe running along the spine. The sides of the head and body are marbled with dark brown patches and spots and there is often a large, deep brown hourglass-shaped pattern on the central back. The upper side of the head bears tubercles and the skin is granulated. There are flattened discs on the fingers and toes, and some webbing, especially on the hind feet. Distribution and habitat Kurixalus idiootocus is widespread in Taiwan at altitudes of up to above sea level. It is typically found near still sheets of water, in paddy fields, damp grassland or shrubby areas. Life cycle The breeding season of Kurixalus idiootocus lasts from March to June. Male frogs aggregate in suitable locations and call from the ground or low shrubs and are aggressive with one another. The advertisement call consists of a series of bird-like trills lasting several seconds, repeated periodically. Unusually, the egg masses containing about 180 eggs are deposited on land in close proximity to water; in reference to this, the specific epithet is derived from the Ancient Greek “idios,” or \\"peculiar\\", and \\"ootocos,\\" or \\"egg-laying\\", according to the describers Kuramoto and Wang. The eggs have two jelly-like coatings, the outer one being tough and non-sticky. They are laid in depressions in the ground, under stones, in crevices or holes and are sometimes covered with dead leaves. Hatching does not take place until heavy rainfall occurs and the depression fills up or the tadpoles get washed into the nearby ditch, pond or temporary pool. The tadpoles are dark brown, sometimes with black spots, and are herbivorous. Status In its Red List of Threatened Species, the IUCN lists Kurixalus idiootocus as being of \\"Least Concern\\". This is because it is a common species with a relatively large range and its population seems to be stable. There is probably some destruction of its habitat by humans but it is present in a number of protected areas where it should be free from disturbance.

Her purpose was to aid ships, usually by towing, on the high seas or in combat or post-combat areas, plus \\"other duties as assigned.\\" She served in the Atlantic Ocean and, at war’s end, returned home proudly with three battle stars to her credit. The fourth Narragansett to be so named by the U.S. Navy, AT-88 was laid down on 31 January 1942 by the Cramp Shipbuilding Co., Philadelphia; launched on 8 August 1942, sponsored by Miss Lois Kinehen Hill, and commissioned on 15 January 1943, Lt. (j.g.) C. J. Wichmann in command.  World War II Atlantic Ocean operations  Following shakedown of the Middle Atlantic seaboard and gunnery and anti-submarine training at Casco Bay, Narragansett departed American waters on 1 April 1943, in convoy for Gibraltar and the Mediterranean theater. Arriving at Gibraltar on the 30th, she continued on to Casablanca, thence to Algiers, arriving on 7 May to begin salvage operations along the North African coast under ComNavNAW.  Supporting the invasion of Sicily  On 6 July, she was detached from those duties and ordered to Bizerte, where she prepared for \\"Operation Husky\\", the invasion of Sicily. On the 8th, she departed Bizerte, and by the 10th she was off Seaglitti with \\"Cent\\" Force as that force landed near the mouth of the Aeate River on the Camerina Plain. Heavy tolls among the landing craft, caused by heavy surf indefinite landmarks, and inexperienced boat crews, kept the tug busy for the next weeks: at first in the Seaglitti area; then with \\"Joss\\" Force at Licata, and finally with \\"Dime\\" Force at Gela. By the end of the month she had moved her operation to Palermo, whence she operated until the end of August.  Under attack by Luftwaffe aircraft  On the 10th of that month she departed Sicily to tow the disabled to Malta, returning in mid- month. At 0430 on 23 August, the Luftwaffe raided Palermo, with bombs scoring on nearby service craft and a near miss wounding two of AT-88's crew. Narragansett's remaining crew immediately set to work to aid the damaged vessels despite explosions which exacted a heavy toll among the fire fighters and damage control sections. Six were dead and 12 seriously wounded before it was over.  Supporting the invasion of Italy  On 30 August Narragansett returned to North Africa to stage for the invasion of Italy at Salerno. On 7 September she departed the Tunisian coast in task unit TU 85.1.1. Soon after midnight, on 9 September, she stood into the Gulf of Salerno. At 0330, the Northern Attack Force sent its assault troops onto the Unnele beaches. By 0507, Narragansett was hard at work aiding the burning and various landing craft and larger vessels in need of assistance. On the 14th she gained a brief respite from beachhead operations with an assignment to tow the Royal Navy cruiser to Malta. Until the end of October she continued to operate in support of the Italian offensive; completing several runs to Malta towing both British and American vessels, salvaging vessels of various types and pulling landing from the beaches. From November 1943, through to 22 February 1944, Narragansett once again operated off North Africa performing general duties at Algiers, towing targets for other vessels in the area, and performing salvage missions from Oran to Bizerte. At the end of February, she returned to Italy with a pontoon drydock in tow. and then resumed salvaging landing craft in the Naples area. During April, she performed towing services along the North African coast to Italy and to Sicily resuming in May, duties as general utility ship at Oran.  Invasion of Southern France operations  On 16 June, the hard working tug, now reclassified ATF-86 (effective 15 May), again departed for Naples, this time to join in the preparations for \\"Operation Dragoon\\", the invasion of Southern France. For the next month and a half, she frequently transited the waters between Bizerte, Naples, Sardinia and Corsica, as harbors on the latter island were turned into supply stations, repair facilities and beaching craft convoy staging areas. By 18 August she was off the Provence coast, assigned to \\"Delta\\" area, just outside the Golfe de St. Tropez. She next shifted to the more heavily defended \\"Carnet\\" area in the Golfe de Frejus. There the Germans, protecting the centuries-old invasion route to the interior along the Argens River and the only airfield and seaplane base on that coast, had mounted impressive coastal batteries along the cliffs heavily mined the waters and beaches. Kept busy in that area until the end of the month. Narragansett then moved on to Toulon and Marseilles. Until mid-October she worked to clear those two harbor for the ships bringing the necessary supplies to the Allied land forces pushing inland toward the heart of the Third Reich.  Returning Stateside for overhaul  Narragansett returned to Algeria on 13 October and in November departed, in convoy, for the United States. Arriving off the Carolina coast on 12 December, she entered the Charleston Navy Yard for overhaul prior to sailing for the Panama Canal and a new assignment, the Pacific Fleet.  Transferred to the Pacific Fleet  On 21 January 1945 she departed for Cristobal, en route to San Francisco, California. While proceeding up the western Central American coast on 23 February, heavy seas and a wind caused the main tow line to floating dry dock ARDC-12 to part. The next day, as the ATF attempted to recover her tow the dock swerved violently hitting the tug and punching a hole, by , in the starboard side at the waterline. Effecting temporary repairs with mattresses and miscellaneous pieces of metal, she remained in the area until the ARDC was taken in tow by the Coast Guard cutter , after which she proceeded into Manzanillo, Mexico, for emergency repairs. On 8 March, she continued on up the coast, arriving at her new home port. Mare Island, on the 20th, to complete the job. On 5 May, she departed for Pearl Harbor, whence she sailed, as a unit of ServRon 2, at the end of the month. After delivering U.S. Army barges and various district craft to Eniwetok, Saipan and Guam, she arrived at San Pedro Bay, Leyte on 11 July, to report for duty with ComServRon 10 for the remainder of the war and into October, she performed towing jobs in the Philippine, Marshall, Mariana, Volcano and Hawaiian Islands.  Returned to the East Coast  Back at Pearl Harbor on 25 October, she sailed for the east coast, arriving at Charleston, South Carolina, to begin the new year. On active duty for only a few months, she was designated for inactivation in March, 1946.  Decommissioning and Sale  Ta Feng (ATF-555) at Keelung harbor, September 28 2019 Decommissioned at Orange, Texas, on 21 December, she remained berthed there as a unit of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet until 1 September 1961, when she was struck from the Naval Vessel Register. Transferred to the Maritime Administration, she was berthed at Beaumont, Texas, as a unit of the National Defense Reserve Fleet into 1991. Narragansett was sold to the Republic of China (Taiwan) on 20 June 1991,https://pmars.marad.dot.gov/NewCards/3542_6555BF.jpg where she was reactivated as Ta Feng (ATF-555). Ta Feng was still in active service as recently as 2019.Combat Fleets of the World  Awards  Narragansett was awarded three battle stars for her services in World War II.

It is endemic to the Western Ghats of India. The specific name chalazodes is composed of the Greek word chalaza meaning grain and odes for the derived adjective, reflecting white granulation of the body. Using 'chalazodes' in the common name, as if it were a proper noun, is probably a misinterpretation. Original description and rediscovery Albert C. L. G. Günther described Raorchestes chalazodes (as Ixalus chalazodes) based on a single female collected by Colonel Richard Henry Beddome from 'Travancore'. There were no verifiable reports of this species, until its rediscovery in 2011 by a team of batrachologists in the Upper Kodayar Region in Tamil Nadu. This secretive frog is found in the wet evergreen forests in and around Kalakkad Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve. Males squeeze through small cracks in bamboo from where they attract females which spawn within the hollows of the plant. The male then guards the eggs and tadpoles until they are mature enough to leave.http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20141029-rare-frog-breeds-inside-bamboo Raorchestes chalazodes in Günther's original description, presumably the holotype.

History TimeGate began life as a one-day mini-con held March 26, 2005 at a local Elks Lodge. The Lodge had already been rented for another event, which fell through. Since the deposit on the Lodge was non-refundable, the presidents of Atlanta Gallifreyans and Stargate Atlanta made the decision to plan an alternate event, one dedicated to Stargate and Doctor Who. Even with only two weeks to plan and promote the new event, 80 people attended. That year, two additional TimeGates were held, in July and in November. Each time, a slight change to the formula was tried, while the basic 'ingredients' remained unchanged. 2006 saw only one TimeGate, but it drew record attendance and was the first to feature professional guests. The following year TimeGate V was the first to feature guests directly related to the two focus shows: Louis Robinson, a singer-songwriter who had been a film editor on Doctor Who in the 1970s, and Keith Adams, who designs special effects shots for the current Stargate shows. With attendance having grown to the point where the original venue became too small, TimeGate has scheduled a move to a hotel location and a transition to a full-fledged full-weekend convention in 2008. The 2008 convention featured John Levene and Tony Amendola and other notable guests including Louis Robinson and Dr. Kevin Grazier. In 2009, TimeGate reached out to fans again inviting Mary Tamm (Romana of Doctor Who) and Brad Greenquist as Guests of Honour and expanding programming to three portals, or tracks. The Gallifrey (Doctor Who Universe), the Abydos (the Stargate Universe), and the Otherworlds portal which focused on other genres such as Star Trek, Star Wars and science. Attendance in 2009 reached a new high with over 400 people attending. In 2010, TimeGate expanded the function space and their programming, adding in a fourth track for Main programming, and new space for gaming and the video room. Also, the cabaret, started in 2008, brought in the most money ever for Atlanta Habitat for Humanity. Past conventions * TimeGate I – Held March 26, 2005 at the Elks Lodge #78 in Tucker, Georgia. By sheer coincidence, this was the same day that the first episode of the new Doctor Who series aired on BBC. Notable programming included Stargate panels, screenings of select Stargate episodes, a Stargate baby shower, Doctor Who panels, documentaries, and a screening of the first episode of the new Doctor Who series. The event also featured live music by Hyperdrive, a buffet, a costume contest, plus open and tournament gaming. * TimeGate II – Held July 9, 2005 at the Elks Lodge. Programming expanded with more gaming, more videos, more panels, a Hyperdrive concert, and a group game of \\"Scene It.\\" * TimeGate III – Held November 19, 2005 at the Elks Lodge. Notable new programming included fannish Jeopardy!, a costume contest, and a Klingon feast. * TimeGate IV – Held October 7, 2006 at the Elks Lodge. Notable programming included a performance by the Atlanta Radio Theatre Company, a workshop on Dalek building, a LaserTag event, and a Team Trivia event. * TimeGate V – Held July 14, 2007 at the Elks Lodge. Guests included Louis Robinson, former BBC Film Editor who'd worked on many shows including Doctor Who, and Keith Adams, Visual Effects Designer for both Stargate series. Notable programming included Prof. Satyre's Sci-Fried Side Show. * TimeGate VI – Held May 23–26, 2008 at the Holiday Inn Select Perimeter. Guests included John Levene, who played Sergeant Benton on Doctor Who; Tony Amendola, who played Master Bra'tac on Stargate SG-1; Dr. Kevin Grazier from NASA's JPL and science advisor on Battlestar Galactica and Eureka; Lars Pearson, owner of Mad Norwegian Press, publisher of Doctor Who reference guides; Louis Robinson, former BBC Film Editor who'd worked on many shows including Doctor Who; Fantasy author Jana Oliver; and Game developer and publisher David Harmer. Notable programming included performances by the Atlanta Radio Theater Company, Prof. Satyre's Sci-Fried Side Show, and Hyperdrive. * TimeGate VII – Held May 22–24, 2009 at the Holiday Inn Select Perimeter. Guests included Mary Tamm, who played Romana on Doctor Who; Brad Greenquist, who played Dr. Keffler on Stargate SG-1; Terrance Dicks, whose body of work for Doctor Who began in 1968 as a script editor; Lars Pearson, owner of Mad Norwegian Press, publisher of Doctor Who reference guides; Louis Robinson, former BBC Film Editor who worked on many shows including Doctor Who and emceed the cabaret; Fantasy author Jana Oliver; and young adult authors Berta Platas and Michelle Roper. Notable programming included video commentary by guests, a cabaret, and a masquerade. *TimeGate VIII – Held May 28–30, 2010 at the Holiday Inn Select Perimeter. Guests included Dominic Glynn, Carmen Argenziano, Diana Botsford, David Read, Louis Robinson, Kelly Yates and young adult authors Berta Platas and Michelle Roper.

It is sometimes referred to as the webless shrub frog. In 2004 it was declared extinct by the International Union for Conservation of Nature when, despite extensive field efforts, no specimen had been seen in the wild after the species was described by Albert Günther in 1876. However, this frog was rediscovered in 2010 in the Peak Wilderness, a highly biodiverse area in the Central Highlands of Sri Lanka. Thus, this species had been \\"lost\\" for more than 130 years. History syntypes in the Natural History Museum, London. The species was described by Albert Günther, a German-born British zoologist, in 1876 based on a collection of 14 syntype specimens by colonel Richard Henry Beddome and W. Ferguson. The latter collection can be pinpointed to the present-day Nuwara Eliya District, whereas the exact location of Beddome's specimens is unknown. Despite extensive field studies, there was no later record of this species, and it was classified as \\"Extinct\\" by IUCN in that 2004. However, in April 2010, during field surveys of amphibians in the Peak Wilderness Sanctuary, researchers encountered about 40 frogs that resembled Pseudophilautus hypomelas. Initially thought to represent a new species, a careful study of these specimens and Günther's syntypes confirmed that these frogs actually were Pseudophilautus hypomelas, and the species was redescribed based on fresh specimens by a group of Sri Lankan scientists in 2013. Description Pseudophilautus hypomelas is a relatively small frog. Its snout–vent length is , with males being smaller than females. The species has characteristic markings on its dorsum: a pair of broad bronze longitudinal bands from the back of the eye to the groin, and a T- or triangle-shaped bronze band between the eyes. Some specimens also have a prominent white stripe running from the tip of the snout to anus and below. Habitat and distribution The newly discovered Pseudophilautus hypomelas were found in elevations of in lower montane rain forests, not far from the Adam's Peak in the Peak Wilderness. They were commonly observed in bushes close (<1 m) to the ground. The species seems to prefer grassy habitats without full canopy cover, such as those in disturbed areas. Günther's specimens were from a different location, from Nuwara Eliya District (to the extent that the location is known). Conservation Pseudophilautus hypomelas has not been reassessed by IUCN, but Wickramasinghe et al. suggest that it should now be classified as \\"Critically Endangered\\", given that the species is only known from a single, small area, and that there are severe anthropogenic threats to the habitat, despite being located in Peak Wilderness Sanctuary, a protected area.

The snout is depressed, elliptical in dorsal view and pointed and projecting in lateral view. The canthus is angular and nearly straight. The tympanum is distinct. The finger and toe tips have broad, oval discs. The fingers show distinct web rudiments, whereas the toes have partial webbing. The dorsum is brown. There is a dark triangle between the eyes, joined to a lyre-shaped mid-dorsal dark marking- The limbs have cross-bars. There is a broad black canthal stripe widening to eye, a dark blotch below eye, and a dark line below supratympanic ridge. The iris is gold in its upper third and dark brown elsewhere. The male advertisement call is a series of five notes. Habitat and conservation Philautus ingeri inhabits montane forests at elevations of above sea level. It is nocturnal. Males call from shrubs above the ground. Reproduction is presumed to be direct (that is, eggs hatching to froglets, without free-living tadpole stage). The habitat of this species is fragmented and threatened by clear-cutting. However, it occurs in the Gunung Mulu National Park and Kinabalu National Park.

Formerly known as Wollet Hall or Woollet Hall, it is a Grade II listed building. History Blue plaque The present building was constructed in 1760 on the site of an earlier Tudor house known as \\"Waletts\\".Origin of place names in Bexley , Bexley Council Its owner in this period was Neighbour Frith, Esq, a London silk merchant. Frith was the last member of a family who had held land in North Cray for many years: his father, John, and grandfather, Roger, are buried at nearby North Cray parish church.North Cray Monumental Inscriptions, Kent Archaeological Society In 1776 Frith willed Woollet Hall to his nephew, the Rev. Edward Cockayn, who adopted the surname Frith.Hasted, Edward. The History and Topographic Survey of the County of Kent, v2, 1797, p.142 Cockayn subsequently leased the house to a Mr Trimmer, probably Joshua Kirby Trimmer of Bexleyheath, whose son, the geologist Joshua Trimmer, was born at North Cray. From 1811 the house was the country residence of British Foreign Secretary, Viscount Castlereagh, later Marquess Londonderry. In 1822 Castlereagh, after suffering a possible nervous breakdown, committed suicide there by cutting his own throat. His residence at the house is still commemorated by a blue plaque installed by English Heritage. Subsequent to Castlereagh's ownership the house was owned by a banker, Richard Gosling.Norman, Philip. Scores and Annals of the West Kent Cricket Club, 1897, p.6, p.85 The Gosling family did not use the name Woollet Hall during their time there.Norman, p.95 By the 1850s the Hall had been purchased by Frederick Friend, whose family occupied it until the late 19th century, followed by a Mr Arthur Bryans. In 1939 the building and grounds were purchased by Goldsmiths College and Woollet Hall was renamed Loring Hall after the first warden of Goldsmiths College, Captain William Loring, who was killed at Gallipoli during the First World War. The main part of the hall was used as a hall of residence for male students and the stable block and associated house were used as an accommodation for a Head of Hall. The grounds became football, hockey and cricket fields for use by the students of Goldsmiths. Goldsmiths College sold the hall and grounds to Bupa sometime in the 1980s, who converted it into a care home. In 1999 it was bought by the charity Sargent Cancer Care for Children and was renamed Malcolm Sargent House. In 2003 it was sold again to a company called Oakfields Care and since March 2004 it has been a care facility for those with learning disabilities.

It is found in the northeastern India, in the West Bengal, Nagaland, Manipur, and Meghalaya states. It range might extend into the adjacent Nepal. The specific name jerdonii honours Thomas C. Jerdon, an English herpetologist. Common names Jerdon's bubble-nest frog, Jerdon's tree frog, and Jerdon's bush frog have been coined for this species. Taxonomy This species was first described as Polypedates jerdonii in 1876 by Albert Günther. Its subsequent placement has included various genera. In 2016, Sathyabhama Das Biju and colleagues erected a new monotypic genus for this species, Frankixalus; the name of the genus honours from the Free University of Brussels. However, just two days earlier, Jiang and colleagues had erected the genus Nasutixalus to accommodate this species and another, new species. This gives priority to Nasutixalus. Illustration from George Albert Boulenger's Fauna of British India, including Ceylon and Burma Description Adult males measure and adult females, based on a single specimen, in snout–vent length. The snout is rather truncate and not protruding. The fingers have basal webbing while the toes have moderate webbing. The dorsal colouration is reddish-brown to brownish-grey. Various markings are present, including an X-shaped brownish-black marking in many specimens. Males have a vocal sac. Tadpoles with ingested eggs Habitat and conservation Nasutixalus jerdonii occurs in montane evergreen forests and secondary forests. It is an arboreal species. Males call from tree holes. The eggs are laid on the inner walls of water-filled hollows, and the tadpoles develop in water. They are oophagous. This species was for a long time only known from the type series collected in 1870. However, populations were discovered in surveys conducted in 2007–2010. The species is threatened by habitat disturbance caused by slash-and-burn agriculture.

It is known with certainty from its type locality, Upper Rotung in Arunachal Pradesh, Northeast India, in the area also claimed by China. It is also reported from Arunachal Pradesh in general as well as from extreme eastern Tibet; these might represent another species. Very little is known about this species, and even its taxonomic validity remains uncertain. Etymology and common names The specific name kempii honours Stanley Wells Kemp, an English zoologist and anthropologist. Common names Kemp's spadefoot toad, Kemp's horned toad, Kemp's bush frog, and Kemp's small treefrog have been coined for it (only the latter two accord with the current placement of this species in Rhacophoridae). Taxonomy and systematics Philautus kempii was originally described by Nelson Annandale as Megalophrys (=Megophrys) kempii, in a genus that is now in the family Megophryidae. Later authors placed the taxon in various megophryid genera. However, in 2006 Delorme and colleagues noted that the holotype has granular belly and distinct finger and toe discs, characteristics that are not be present in Megophryidae. Instead, they concluded that Annandale's Megalophrys kempii is a rhacophorid, likely in the genus Philautus. It has also been placed in other rhacophorid genera. Description The holotype measures in snout–vent length and is at least a sub-adult. The snout is relatively long and sloping forwards, round, and truncate in profile. The tympanum is distinct. The limbs are slender. The fingers and toes bear small but distinct discs. The toes have basal webbing. Skin is smooth except for the belly. The dorsum (in preservative) is dark olive and has symmetrically arranged greyish- green marks. The snout is also greyish-green. The hind limbs have obscure cross-bands. The ventral surfaces are yellowish. Habitat and conservation Presumably, this species inhabits tropical moist forest, but nothing definite is known regarding its habitats and biology.

It is endemic to the Western Ghats, India, where it is only known from the state of Karnataka. Many of the known populations are from the Kodagu district, known also by its anglicised former name of Coorg—hence the common name. It is also known from the Shimoga district in the Sharavathi basin where it was described as a new species, Philautus neelanethrus, but this is now considered to be a junior synonym of Raorchestes luteolus. Description Raorchestes luteolus is a small frog, males measuring in snout-vent length. Its colour is variable. The dominant colour form is yellowish brown with light-brownish lines or light-yellowish with discontinuous light-brown lines, but some individuals may be almost golden yellow with only faint spots. The iris is light brown encircled with a bluish green outer ring. Raorchestes luteolus is a close relative of Raorchestes travancoricus with which it can be confused. The distinguishing characters are its medium size (mean adult male snout-vent length 26.8 mm), pointed snout, rounded canthus, yellow or yellowish brown dorsum with dark brown spots and faint discontinuous lines, and loreal and golden yellow or yellowish brown tympanic regions. Habitat Raorchestes luteolus are most commonly found in disturbed habitats, near coffee plantations adjacent to primary forests and waysides. In Sharavathi it was also found from Myristica swamps. Behaviour Raorchestes luteolus are often found on leaves or stems of shrubs about one metre above the ground. Male frogs start calling at dusk, first under the leaf litter and then ascending to the vegetation. Call characteristics may differ between populations; in particular, between the Sharavathi frogs described as Philautus neelanethrus and the nominal Raorchestes luteolus. Life cycle The life cycle of Raorchestes luteolus is not known in any detail, but the observation of a pair in amplexus away from water suggests that it has direct development, as is typical for the genus Raorchestes.

It is endemic to the Western Ghats, India. It is sometimes known as the Kalpetta yellow bush frog. It is also called the lichen bush frog for its patchy lichen like patterning that make it cryptic. First described in 2005 based on a specimen obtained in Kalpetta, the species has subsequently found to be distributed in many parts of the Western Ghats. Taxonomy A view of the pattern and texture resembling lichen The species was originally described in the genus Philautus but has since been moved into the genus Raorchestes. The species name is derived from Greek nero for water and stagona for drop and refers to the call of the frog which is emitted from high up in the trees and resembles the sound of a raindrop falling into water. Like all other members of this genus, eggs are thought to develop into little froglets entirely within the egg-shell, although this direct development pattern was not directly observed in the species at the time of its description. Description This species is distinguished from others in the genus by the presence of webbing between all the fingers and fully webbed toes as well. A fringe of skin is found along the outer edge of the fore and hind limbs. The tongue has a pointed papilla. The snout to vent length varies from about 3 to 3.5 cm and the colouration makes it cryptic among lichen and moss patches on tree trunks. The skin has projections making it appear rough. The species was described as being widely distributed in the Wayanad region between Mananthavady, Sultan Battery, and Kalpetta where its call could be heard easily during the rainy season.

It is the first to be built in Honduras and the sixth in Central America. The Tegucigalpa Honduras Temple serves Latter-day Saints in Honduras and Nicaragua. There are 168,000 Latter- day Saints in Honduras and Nicaragua in 302 congregations. History The temple was announced in a letter to local church leaders 9 June 2006; and later in a press release published 24 June 2006. Ceremonial groundbreaking and dedication were held at a site located in eastern Tegucigalpa, near the Basilica de Suyapa, on 9 June 2007, but the church later announced that the temple would be built at a new site. On 28 January 2009, the LDS Church announced that due to objections from the local government, the proposed temple would no longer be located at the previously designated site. The primary reason for the relocation was due to a belief, widely held by members of the Tegucigalpa city council, that the temple would overshadow the local basilica. The church had all the primary permits secured, but the city council halted all construction and would not honor the permits. Out of respect for the strong feelings of those involved, the church decided to seek a new location. The temple was to be built adjacent to an LDS Church Institute of Religion. Excavation had begun before the church ceded to pressure to relocate the building.Mormones ya no construirán templo en el área de Suyapa (Spanish) Church officials decided to move the temple in order to avoid confrontation.No hubo acuerdo con la Iglesia Católica (Spanish) This news story contains a letter from Nery Rodriguez, Director of Public Affairs for the LDS Church in Honduras, explaining why the church will not be building at the original site. The plans to build a temple in Tegucigalpa were announced by the LDS Church to local church leaders on June 9, 2006. The original groundbreaking and site dedication was on 9 June 2007, by Spencer V. Jones, a member of the church's Second Quorum of the Seventy and president of the church's Central America Area. On December 11, 2012, the church announced an open house from February 9 through March 2, 2013. The temple was dedicated on March 17, 2013 by Dieter F. Uchtdorf of the church's First Presidency...

It is found from eastern Bangladesh east through Myanmar and Thailand to Cambodia, northern Vietnam, Laos, and Peninsular Malaysia. Its distribution might well extend into northeastern India and southern China. This species was first described by George Albert Boulenger based on seven specimens collected by Leonardo Fea from Karen Hills, Burma. Description This is a small frog species. Males measure up to in snout-vent length, although modern sources give range for SVL. They have a rounded snout and hidden tympanum. The fingers and toes short and bear adhesive discs; fingers are free from webbing but toes are slightly webbed at their base. The back is greyish or brown. A dark bar or triangular blotch between the eyes and curved dark band the sides may be present. The hind limbs have some crossbars. Males have a large vocal sac. Habitat Raorchestes parvulus is typically found in evergreen forest, but it can also be found in grassland with heath forest. Individuals are mostly found in trees and dense vegetation, both away from water and near streams. The altitudinal range is above sea level. Males call from the vegetation. The development is believed to be direct. This species is probably suffering from habitat loss caused by logging and expanding agriculture and settlements. However, it is not considered threatened overall because of its wide distribution and presumed large total population. It is also documented from several protected areas and is likely present in many more.

It is owned by the City of New Smyrna Beach. The fixed-base operator on field, Epic Aviation, offers 100LL Avgas and Jet-A fuel and pilot amenities. Epic Flight Academy is a flight school offering a full range of flight training in response to the pilot shortage. Airgate Aviation is a full service fixed based operator, with Hertz rental cars on site. Airgate Cafe is open daily, from 6:00 am until 2:00 pm. Airgate offers single point and overawing Jet-A fuel as well as 100LL Avgas. This airport is assigned a three- letter location identifier of EVB by the Federal Aviation Administration, but it does not have an International Air Transport Association (IATA) airport code. History Prior to World War II, the present airport site was home to both a golf course and a grass airstrip. In 1942, the site was taken over by the U.S. Navy and the present paved runway complex constructed. Designated as Navy Outlying Field New Smyrna Beach, it operated as an auxiliary field to advanced naval flight training operations being conducted at nearby Naval Air Station Daytona Beach, Naval Air Station Sanford and Naval Air Station DeLand. In 1947, NOLF New Smyrna Beach was decommissioned and the facility conveyed back to the City of New Smryna Beach for use as a civilian airport. As a Navy airfield, the facility originally incorporated four intersecting asphalt runways. Although all paved areas remain, only three of the runways remain operational today.http://www.cfaspp.com/FASP/AirportPDFs/newsmyrnabeachmuniapril2005.pdf Prior to 2004, the airport was an uncontrolled facility. In October 2004, a Level I contract control at the airport became operational, changing the airport's status to that of a controlled field. Today the airport serves the needs of charter airlines and general aviation activities, to include flight training and corporate air travel. In 2006, the City of New Smyrna Beach added the additional name to the airport of Jack Bolt Field in honor of the late Naval Aviator, Lieutenant Colonel John \\"Jack\\" Bolt, USMC. A former New Smyrna Beach resident, Bolt was both an aerial ace and a recipient of the Navy Cross.http://www.myhometownnews.net/index.php?id=3586 While flying the F4U Corsair with VMF-214, Bolt shot down six Japanese Zero fighters during World War II. During the Korean War, while on an exchange assignment with the U.S. Air Force's 39th Fighter Interceptor Squadron flying the F-86 Sabrejet, Bolt also shot down six North Korean MiG-15 jet fighters. A military aircraft propeller and a plaque commemorating Bolt's accomplishments was erected at the airport in 2006. Facilities and aircraft New Smyrna Beach Municipal Airport covers an area of which contains three asphalt paved runways: *Runway 2/20: 4,000 x 100 ft (1,219 x 30 m) *Runway 7/25: 5,000 x 75 ft (1,524 x 23 m), Lighted without PAPI *Runway 11/29: 4,319 x 100 ft (1,316 x 30 m), Lighted with PAPI For the 12-month period ending May 7, 2002, the airport had 140,554 aircraft operations, an average of 385 per day: 99.6% general aviation, 0.3% air taxi and <0.1% military.

It is endemic to the central hills of Sri Lanka and is known from the Peak Wilderness Sanctuary, Agra Bopath, Horton Plains, and Pedro. The specific name schmarda honours Ludwig Karl Schmarda, an Austrian physician, naturalist, and traveler. Common names Sri Lanka bug-eyed frog and Schmarda's shrub frog have been coined for it. Description Adult males measure and adult females, based on only two specimens, in snout–vent length. The body is stout. The snout is obtusely pointed. The tympanum is visible and the supratympanic fold is prominent. The fingers have lateral dermal fringes and only rudimentary webbing, whereas the toes are medially webbed. Skin of the upper side is rough with glandular folds, glandular warts, and horn-like spinules. The upper parts are dark green and red-brown; the flanks grade from yellow through dark brown to light brown. The chest and abdomen are yellow and bear bright-yellow spots. Habitat and conservation Pseudophilautus schmarda occurs primarily in cloud forests at elevations of above sea level, but has also been recorded in pine and abandoned tea plantations. While juveniles have been observed on the forest floor, adults occur in the understorey vegetation some above the ground. The eggs are deposited in a deep hole that the female excavates in the forest floor. Pseudophilautus schmarda is a common frog. While much of its range lies within protected areas, habitat deterioration is taking place because of illegal firewood collection, clear-cutting for timber, and conversion to agricultural land such as tea plantations.

It is endemic to Greater Shillong in North East India. It is known from the Khasi Hills in the region of Shillong, Meghalaya in north-eastern India. It has been categorized as Critically Endangered because its extent of occurrence is less than 100 km², its distribution is severely fragmented, there is continuing decline in the extent and quality of its habitat, and in the number of mature individuals in and around Shillong, in Meghalaya, northeastern India. Population The population is believed to have declined significantly. While it was considered to be abundant in the 1970s, it is now difficult to find specimens of this frog. Recent ongoing (post 1993) vocalization surveys in and around Malki Forest (the type locality) have failed to record this species. Habitat and threats This species inhabits tropical moist forests. Selective logging, the collection of wood for subsistence use, and urbanization, are all major threats to the species' habitat. Conservation It is not known whether or not this species occurs in any protected areas, but habitat protection and maintenance are urgent priorities for this species, and additional survey work is necessary to assess its current population status.

News NZ, 20 November 2009. was a New Zealand miner and unionist, who gained national attention as the leader of the Mount Isa Mines Strike of 1964. Early life Mackie was born in 1914 in New Zealand as Maurice Patrick Murphy, son of Matthew and Ellen Murphy. The birth was registered in Ohakune.Registrar-General online historic birth records He gained criminal records in a number of countries under various aliases. The article \\"1964 Mount Isa Mines strike\\" says Mackie was New Zealand-born but a \\"Canadian-trained activist\\" and a member of the Industrial Workers of the World (the \\"Wobblies\\", who were syndicalist rather than Marxist), but gives no source for these allegations. Eventually he moved to Australia, under a false identity carrying the name of Eugene Markie. He went to work as a miner for Mount Isa Mines in Queensland, and when he registered to work there, a comment was made to him along the lines that Eugene was a girl's name. He replied \\"Bill, Fred, Pat, call me what you like\\". \\"Pat it is\\" the man said. Mackie's pseudonym came from a misprint on his payslips when he first began work in the mines, which he attempted to have corrected. However, as the company kept producing cheques and payslips in the name of \\"Mackie\\", he ultimately adopted the name and called himself \\"Pat Mackie\\". Mount Isa Mines strike The dispute which led to the Mount Isa Mines Strike of 1964 involved numerous issues of pay and conditions and lasted an unprecedented 32 weeks. Mackie was a member of the Australian Workers' Union (AWU) and became the de facto leader of the strike. While it was AWU policy to resolve the dispute through arbitration before the Industrial Relations Commission, he pursued direct militant action and insisted on an enterprise agreement with the company. As a consequence the AWU expelled him from the union, which allowed the company to terminate his employment. The dispute was prolonged by the insistence of strikers that he be reinstated, a demand that was never met. After the dispute, Mackie was banned from Mount Isa Mines, and the government unsuccessfully tried to have him deported to New Zealand. Media profile Mackie was the subject of intense media speculation at the time of the dispute, and became an iconic figure in Australia. As he wore a baseball cap of the Boston Red Sox, and spoke with an apparent American accent, he was often portrayed as an \\"American gangster\\" and foreign communist. Mackie lived for a time on the Mineside and later lived on Buckley Avenue, Parkside near the Mount Isa State High School. He also drove a Willys Jeep. Sometimes he was accused of deliberately weakening Australia to help an invasion by communist China, and his criminal record was constantly mentioned. Mackie successfully sued a newspaper owned by Australia media mogul Frank Packer in the early 1970s for defamation. He won damages totalling $30,000. A third was awarded for misrepresenting his criminal record, while the remainder was awarded for misrepresenting his involvement in the dispute. Legacy Mackie's story inspired a Queensland Music Festival musical production entitled Red Cap which premiered at the Mount Isa Civic Centre on 11 July 2007. Pat Mackie died on 19 November 2009, aged 95.Cornish, Murray: Unionist Pat Mackie dies, Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 19 November 2009.

Its specific name, travancoricus, as well as its three common names, refer to its type locality, Bodinayakkanur in the former Travancore state (now in Tamil Nadu). Rediscovery For some time, R. travancoricus was feared to be extinct. In early 2009, University of Delhi researchers announced that the species had been rediscovered in the Western Ghats. The rediscovery was a result of intense surveying in the Western Ghats. Before the discovery of a single male from Vandiperiyar in 2004, the species had not been recorded after its description in 1891 by George Albert Boulenger. More recently, two males have been found from Vagamon. The species remains very rare, and the known populations, both in Kerala, occur in disturbed habitat (tea plantations) outside protected areas. Description R. travancoricus is a small frog, males measuring in snout-vent length and the single measured female .

Goat prairies, sometimes termed hill prairies, or dry prairies are found mainly along the valley of the Upper Mississippi River in the Driftless Area, but can occur elsewhere. Normally a variant of tallgrass prairie, they are found on south- southwest-facing slopes, which receive considerable winter sun, causing a frequent freeze-thaw cycle. Bedrock generally lies not too far below. Left to themselves, they are subject to natural fire which rejuvenates the ecosystem. Open grasslands along this stretch of the Mississippi are rapidly colonized by mixed forests. However, the low moisture content of the slopes, the winter freeze-thaw cycle, and the thin layer of soil help to keep goat prairies free of trees. Human suppression of natural fire has greatly reduced their numbers. For publicly owned goat prairies, fire has been carefully set and contained.

Together with the preceding Nicaean Empire and the contemporary Frankokratia, this period is known as the late Byzantine Empire. From the start, the regime faced numerous problems.Mango, p. 255 The Turks of Asia Minor had since 1263 been raiding and expanding into Byzantine territory in Asia Minor. Anatolia, which had formed the very heart of the shrinking empire, was systematically lost to numerous Turkic ghazis, whose raids evolved into conquering expeditions inspired by Islamic zeal, the prospect of economic gain, and the desire to seek refuge from the MongolsJohn Joseph Saunders, pp. 79 after the disastrous Battle of Köse Dağ in 1243. With a decreasing source of food and manpower, the Palaiologoi were forced to fight on several fronts, most of them being Christian states: the Second Bulgarian Empire, the Serbian Empire, the remnants of the Latin Empire and even the Knights Hospitaller. The loss of land in the east to the Turks and in the west to the Bulgarians was complemented by two disastrous civil wars, the Black Death and the 1354 earthquake at Gallipoli, whose destruction and evacuation allowed the Turks to occupy it. By 1380, the Byzantine Empire consisted of the capital Constantinople and a few other isolated exclaves, which only nominally recognized the Emperor as their lord. Nonetheless, Byzantine diplomacy coupled with the adroit exploitation of internal divisions and external threats among their enemies, and above all the invasion of Anatolia by Timur, allowed Byzantium to survive until 1453. The last remnants of the Byzantine Empire, the Despotate of the Morea and the Empire of Trebizond, fell shortly afterwards. However, the Palaiologan period witnessed a renewed flourishing in art and the letters, in what has been called the \\"Palaiologian Renaissance\\". The migration of Byzantine scholars to the West also helped to spark the Italian Renaissance. Background After 1204, the Byzantine Empire was partitioned between various successor states, with the Latin Empire in control of Constantinople Following the Fourth Crusade, the Byzantine Empire had fractured into the Greek successor-states of Nicaea, Epirus and Trebizond, with a multitude of Frankish and Latin possessions occupying the remainder, nominally subject to the Latin Emperors at Constantinople. In addition, the disintegration of the Byzantine Empire allowed the Bulgarians, the Serbs and the various Turcoman emirates of Anatolia to make gains. Although Epirus was initially the strongest of the three Greek states, the Nicaeans were the ones who succeeded in taking back the city of Constantinople from the Latin Empire.Mango, p. 254 The Nicaean Empire was successful in holding its own against its Latin and Seljuk opponents. At the Battle of Meander Valley, a Turkic force was repelled and an earlier assault on Nicaea led to the death of the Seljuk Sultan. In the west, the Latins were unable to expand into Anatolia; consolidating Thrace against Bulgaria was a challenge that kept the Latins occupied for the duration of the Latin Empire. In 1261, the Empire of Nicaea was ruled by John IV Laskaris, a boy of ten years. However, John IV was overshadowed by his co-emperor, Michael VIII Palaiologos. Palaiologos was a leading noble of military standing and the main figure of the regency of John IV, who had used this role to propel himself to the throne, and set the stage for his becoming sole Emperor of the restored Byzantine Empire. Michael VIII Palaiologos, 1261–1282 Hyperpyron of Michael VIII In 1261, while the bulk of the Latin Empire's military forces were absent from Constantinople, the Byzantine General Alexios Strategopoulos used the opportunity to seize the city with 600 troops. Thrace, Macedonia and Thessalonica had already been taken by Nicaea in 1246. Following the capture of Constantinople, Michael ordered the blinding of John IV in December 1261, so as to become sole emperor. As a result, Patriarch Arsenios excommunicated Michael, but he was deposed and replaced by Joseph I. Restoration of Constantinople The Fourth Crusade and their successors, the Latin Empire, had done much to reduce Byzantium's finest city to an underpopulated wreck.Madden, pp. 110–113 Michael VIII began the task of restoring many monasteries, public buildings and defence works.Mango, p. 256 The Hagia Sophia, horribly looted in the Crusade of 1204, was refurbished to Greek Orthodox tradition. The Kontoskalion harbour and the walls of Constantinople were all strengthened against a possible new expedition by the Latin West. Many hospitals, hospices, markets, baths, streets and churches were built, some with private patronage. Even a new Mosque was built to compensate for the one burnt during the Fourth Crusade. These attempts were costly and crippling taxes were placed on the peasantry.Madden, p. 179 Nonetheless, the city grew new cultural and diplomatic contacts, notably with the Mamelukes. Both had common enemies; Latin aggression, and later on, the Ottoman Turks. Foreign policy The Sultanate of Rum was in chaos and decentralized ever since the Mongol invasions in ca. 1240.Lowe, Steven, and Martin Baker. \\"Seljuks of Rum\\". 21 Feb. 1992. 29 May 2007 As a result, the greatest threat to Byzantium was not the Muslims but their Christian counterparts in the West — Michael VIII knew that the Venetians and the Franks would no doubt launch another attempt to establish Latin rule in Constantinople. The situation became worse when Charles I of Anjou conquered Sicily from the Hohenstaufens in 1266.Mango, p. 257 In 1267, Pope Clement IV arranged a pact, whereby Charles would receive land in the East in return for assisting a new military expedition to Constantinople. A delay on Charles' end meant that Michael VIII was given enough time to negotiate a union between the Church of Rome and that of Constantinople in 1274, thus removing papal support for an invasion of Constantinople. Unfortunately for Michael VIII, the new union was seen as a fake by Clement's successor, Martin IV. The Greek Church was excommunicated, and Charles was given renewed papal support for the invasion of Constantinople.Mango, p. 258 In order to counter this, Michael VIII subsidized Peter III of Aragon's attempts to seize Sicily from Charles. Michael's efforts paid off with the outbreak of the Sicilian Vespers, a revolt that overthrew the Angevin King of Sicily and installed Peter III of Aragon as King of Sicily in 1281. For the remainder of his life, Michael campaigned to drive the Latins out of Greece and the Balkans, and secure his position versus the Bulgarians. He was largely successful, regaining several islands in the Aegean, and establishing a foothold in the Peloponnese, that would grow to become the Despotate of the Morea. The downside however was that Michael's efforts in the West absorbed most of the Empire's manpower and resources, and neglected the Asian provinces, where a new and fateful threat was rising: the beylik of Osman I, who by 1263 had captured Sogut. Nevertheless, the border was kept relatively secure, and no significant losses occurred in Asia Minor during Michael's reign. thumb400pxrightMiddle East c. 1263Madden, p. 162Shepherd, William R. \\"The Byzantine Empire in 1265.\\" Perry–Castañeda Library. 1926.

KEY: Dark Green: Ottoman domain by the 1300s, dotted line indicates conquests up to 1326 Purple: Byzantine Empire Light Green: Turkic lands Blue: Cilicia Red/Pink: Latin states Domestic policy Michael VIII's foreign policy relied heavily on diplomacy; nevertheless, his construction projects and military campaigns against the remaining Latins were extensive as well as expensive; the Nicaean army was modeled around the Komnenian army, and while it was not as effective, it was just as burdensome on the treasury. The result was that heavy taxes were levied on the peasantry, something that the Ottomans would later use to their advantage, winning over these poverty-stricken peasants with promises of lower taxes. The Second Council of Lyons and the ostensible union of the two Churches did little to avert Catholic aggression, while at the same time the Orthodox population, led by large parts of the priesthood, denounced Michael VIII as a traitor. His death in 1282 came as a relief to many, and his body was denied an Orthodox funeral, as a result of his policies towards Rome. Legacy Michael VIII was a very energetic, ambitious and capable emperor who had enlarged and preserved the Empire and had once again made Byzantium a power to be reckoned with in the region. His army, however, was still small, and diplomacy was relied upon more than ever. An extortionate tax system supported his ambitious and successful foreign policies of expansion, as well as his numerous bribes and gifts to various potentates. He had put Byzantium on the road of recovery, but his achievements were still perilously fragile, as events would soon show. Andronikos II Palaiologos, 1282–1328 Andronikos II was the son of Michael VIII. He ascended the throne in 1282, at the age of 24. Foreign policy Andronikos II was tied down with events in the West and the East. The Serbians under King Stefan Uroš II Milutin had begun invading the Balkans and took Skopje in 1282 and raids against Macedonia were launched throughout the 1290s. Byzantine counter-attacks failed to stop these, and as a result Andronikos was forced to resort to diplomacy, marrying his 5-year-old daughter to the Serbian King and ceding a number of forts from Ohrid to Stip to Strumica as a \\"dowry\\". Nonetheless, the Serbs continued their expansion. Unlike his father, Andronikos II recognized the gravity of the situation in Asia Minor,Mango, p. 260 and tried to drive out the Turks, utilizing a variety of methods. His first action was to move his court to Asia Minor, where he could better oversee the construction of fortifications and raise troop morale.Mango, p. 261 His General, Alexios Philanthropenos, was an able commander, campaigning with some success against the Turks in the Meander Valley. Unfortunately Byzantium was robbed of his services when he staged an unsuccessful coup, leading to his blinding. Next Andronikos sent his son, Michael IX, and the Heteriarch George Mouzalon to attack the Turks who were laying siege to Nicomedia, but they were beaten at the Battle of Bapheus in 1302. Not giving up, Andronikos hired the 6,500 strong \\"Catalan Company\\" of Almogavars, led by Roger de Flor. Originating from Catalonia, these hardy mercenaries were used to skirmishing against the Moors in Spain and now, for an extraordinarily high price, they drove the Turks back in Asia Minor. Once again, these successes were nullified when their leader, Roger de Flor, was assassinated on his way to meet Andronikos; the Catalans then revolted against imperial authority, and began pillaging and raiding cities in Thrace, leaving Asia Minor open to Turkish incursions. After this, Andronikos turned to diplomacy, asking the Ilkhanids of Persia to send troops to attack the Turks, but negotiations for such an alliance failed. Domestic policy Andronikos II's debasement of the Byzantine currency, along with his co-rule with his father, his son and his grandson as well as his own sole rule, resulted in the minting of several different coins during his reign. Andronikos II ordered the Union of the Orthodox and Catholic Churches to be canceled, a move which pleased many. But he also ordered drastic reductions in the military, and effectively disbanded the navy, which his father had worked hard to build up. As a result, tax reductions throughout the Empire were possible, earning him greater popularity while seriously undermining Byzantium's abilities to deal with its opponents. He debased the hyperpyron currency and heavily taxed the military elite of the pronoiarioi, thereby further reducing Byzantium's military capability. While these solved some problems that Michael VIII had left for his son, it unraveled his father's attempts at restoring the power of the Byzantine Empire; where Michael VIII had attempted to deal with problems outside the Empire, Andronikos aimed to solve the internal problems resulting from his father's reign. Civil War and abdication Andronikos II's policies were not successful in dealing with Byzantium's external problems; however, it would be threats from within the Empire that led to his abdication — in 1320 Andronikos III, the young (in his twenties) grandson of Andronikos II was disinherited by the Emperor.Mango, p. 262 Andronikos III's brother Manuel Palaiologos had been accidentally murdered by Andronikos III's companions over a competitive love affair. His father (Michael IX), the son of Andronikos II, died of shock as a result of his son's death. Andronikos III did not take his disinheritance lightly — organizing an armed opposition, he succeeded in drawing support with promises of generous tax cuts, even beyond those enacted by Andronikos II. Andronikos II was powerless to stop the young usurper; he granted him Thrace as an appanage in 1321, the title of co-emperor in 1322, and after a small war where the Bulgarians and Serbians played the two sides against each other, Andronikos II was forced to abdicate and retire as a monk to a monastery, where he died in 1332. Despite the calamities of the civil war, Andronikos III was about to revitalise the Empire. Although Asia Minor was at this point destined to fall to the Turks, it had been in a worse position in 1091 and yet still recovered by Byzantium. Legacy Andronikos II attempted to solve Byzantium's internal problems more than his father had. The solutions he chose however had severe repercussions. They undermined the military and financial basis of the state, and the disasters suffered by his foreign policy failures further worsened the situation. Dissatisfaction from his failure, his old age and a \\"reckless grandson\\" culminated in his abdication. Andronikos III, 1328–1341 Foreign policy Byzantium at the beginning of Andronikos III's reign. The rule of Andronikos III is characterized as the last genuine attempt to restore Byzantine fortunes. His attempts came close to fruition, but the many hostile neighbors of Byzantium eventually took their toll on an Empire in decline. His first concern was that of Asia Minor. Nicaea, until 1261 the capital of the Empire, was under siege by Ottoman Turks. In the summer of 1329, Andronikos III launched a relief attempt which culminated in a defeat at the Battle of Pelekanon on June 10,Mango, p. 263 and in 1331, the city fell. Not wishing to see Nicomedia or the other few remaining forts in Asia Minor suffer the same fate, Andronikos III sought to pay off the Ottomans with tribute — the Ottomans did not stop at this and seized Nicomedia as well in 1337. Despite this, Andronikos III scored a few successes in the Aegean: in 1329, Chios was recovered, and in 1335, Andronikos arranged an alliance involving financial indemnities with the Turkic Emir Bahud-din Umur, Bey of Aydin, and was able to recover Lesbos and Phocaea from the Latins. In Europe, Andronikos III had mixed results; Thessaly returned to Imperial rule in 1333, but Serbia once again began expanding southwards: led by the Byzantine renegade Syrgiannes Palaiologos, Serbian forces took five key forts from Byzantium in 1334 and forced it to recognize the new borders. Andronikos was then forced to recognize Serbian rule in Macedonia. In addition, Andronikos faced a further reversal when leading his army at Rousokastron where he was defeated by the Bulgarians under their leader Ivan Alexander. Nevertheless, Andronikos was able to bring back Epirus into the fold in 1341 through the use of diplomacy. The result was that while the Empire was reduced to its European territories, it had succeeded in bringing much of Greece under its control. Unfortunately for the newly expanded Byzantium, Stephen Dusan (ruling Serbia from 1331) decided to take these lands as well from Byzantium. The death of Andronikos III and the resulting chaos left the Empire in no position to fight back. Legacy Although ultimately unsuccessful, the reign of Andronikos III was one of the last bright spots in Byzantine history, as the Empire's position was becoming increasingly precarious. Andronikos was able to score some successes in his life as he campaigned vigorously against the Genoese with success and reestablished some control over Epirus and Thessaly. Throughout his reign, he was also able to work with competent administrators such as John Kantakouzenos who, along with many of the nobles supported Andronikos during the civil war with Andronikos II, However, numerous reversals against Byzantium's enemies such as Serbia and the rising Ottomans at battles such as Pelekanon further drained the power Byzantium had in comparison to its neighbors. This would be a situation that would not be helped by his sudden death in the 1340s which resulted in a civil war between the regency of John V(a coalition of Anna of Savoy, Alexios Apokaukos and the patriarch of Constantinople, John XIV) and the nobility who promoted John Kantakouzenos as emperor.Editors of Britannica, editor. \\"Andronicus III Palaeologus\\", Encyclopædia Britannica, Encyclopædia Britannica, inc., June 11, 2018, https://www.britannica.com/biography/Andronicus-III-Palaeologus In addition, diplomacy became less useful, as Byzantium's enemies realized that the Emperor had not the military or even economic might to back his word. While there was a general decline in the Empire's fortunes, Andronikos III's death would be the coup de grâce for the Empire — his 10-year-old son was led by a regency that was torn apart in dynastic rivalries which led to the Second Palaiologan Civil War and the recognition of John Kantakouzenos as emperor and a catastrophe from which Byzantium would never recover. The rise and fall of Kantakouzenos, 1341–1357 The Byzantine Empire entered into a new era of decay in 1341. The Empire was ravaged by multiple serious disastersMango, p. 265 — alongside wars and civil wars, renewed epidemics of bubonic plague swept through its diminished lands. The first outbreak occurred in 1347, and between the 1360s and 1420s, eight further outbreaks of plague are recorded. Cities were full of social unrest between the corrupt wealthy (who had been exploiting the tax system for their own benefit) and the countless landless peasants burdened by the demands of the government. Religious controversy, the cancer of Byzantium in the 7th and 8th centuries, once again emerged in the form of the Hesychasm controversy, which eventually became a doctrine of the Eastern Orthodox church. There were numerous earthquakes, destroying Byzantium's infrastructure — the fortress of Gallipoli was destroyed in 1354 by such an earthquake and the Ottoman Turks lost no time in taking it and establishing a bridgehead in Europe. Meanwhile, the Serbs continued pressing south, removing any nominal Imperial control in Epirus. The Empire shrunk in size and when the civil war ended, Byzantium would be a petty city state, hanging on to life through the respites of her foes, and soon to-be protectors. The civil war of 1341–1347 John V, ten years old at his ascension, was guided by a regency consisting of his mother, Anna of Savoy, John VI Kantakouzenos and the Patriarch of Constantinople (John XIV Kalekas). The Patriarch, aided by the ambitious Alexios Apokaukos, sparked the civil conflict when he convinced the Empress that John V's rule was threatened by the ambitions of Kantakouzenos. In September 1341, while Kantakouzenos was in Thrace, Kalekas declared himself as regent and launched a vicious attack on Kantakouzenos, his supporters and family. In October, Anna ordered Kantakouzenos to resign his command.Mango, p. 266 Kantakouzenos not only refused, but declared himself Emperor at Didymoteichon, allegedly to protect John V's rule from Kalekas. Whether or not Kantakouzenos wished to be Emperor is not known, but the provocative actions of the Patriarch forced Kantakouzenos to fight to retain his power and started the civil war. There were not nearly enough troops to defend Byzantium's borders at the time and there certainly was not enough for the two factions to split; consequently, foreigner mercenaries were brought in. Kantakouzenos hired Turks and Serbs — his main supply of Turkish mercenaries came from the Bey of Aydin, a nominal ally established by Andronikos III. The Regency of John V relied on Turkish mercenaries as well. However, Kantakouzenos began to draw support from the Ottoman Sultan Orhan, who wed Kantakouzenos' daughter in 1345. By 1347, Kantakouzenos had triumphed and entered Constantinople. However, in his hour of victory, he came to an accord with Anna and her son, John V: John V (now 15 years of age) and Kantakouzenos would rule as co-emperors, though John V would be the junior in this relationship.Mango, p. 267 This unlikely partnership was not destined to last long. Reign and fall of John VI Kantakouzenos, 1347–1357 Byzantine coins showing John V and his co-emperor & guide Kantakouzenos during their peaceful co-existence Kantakouzenos had a son, Matthew Kantakouzenos — and any hope of keeping peace between John V and Matthew became more remote as the two grew older and more independent. John V wed Kantakouzenos' daughter, thus becoming his son in law, in a move designed to bind the two families, but it was destined to fail. In 1353, Kantakouzenos was still hopeful that peace would be maintained, but in that year, John V launched a military attack on Matthew, thereby re-igniting the civil war. John V was demoted and exiled to the island of Tenedos, one of the few islands in the Aegean still under Byzantine control, while Kantakouzenos made his son Matthew co-emperor. John V would not give up so easy however, and in 1354 Ottoman troops began crossing over into Thrace in his support. The citizens of Constantinople became gripped with fear and in November of that same year, John V launched a successful coup with Genoan aid. Kantakouzenos now abdicated and retired to a monastery, where he would write his memoirs and thoughts until his death in 1383.Mango, p. 268 Matthew Kantakouzenos, no doubt disappointed with his father's failure, continued to resist John V. Since the Ottoman Sultan Orhan was his brother-in-law, he was able to obtain troops from him, but had barely begun his campaign when he was captured in the summer of 1356. He was forced to renounce his claims in 1357 and exiled to the Morea sometime between 1361 and 1383, though other sources indicate 1391 a possible date. At 25 years, John V had managed to establish himself firmly as ruler of the Empire, at the cost of bleeding out all its resources. Turkish immigration The lands ravaged and depopulated by the civil war were filled up by arriving Turks who colonised the land through a mixture of conquest and trade. The result was that Byzantium's power was undermined beyond all recovery — two hundred years ago Byzantium could rely on the people living in the lands of Anatolia, Greece, Macedonia and several large islands like Cyprus and Crete. Now the population under its control was limited to the few remaining cities in Byzantine possession, namely Thessalonica and Constantinople and the surrounding countryside, and the Despotate of the Morea. The immigration of Turks would be decisive in the survival of the Empire as it gave her most dire enemy, the Ottomans, a new power base, not in Asia but now in Europe. John V, 1354–1391 Byzantium (in red) in 1369, after the Ottomans conquered the city of Adrianople John V Palaiologos now had to face the serious threat the Ottomans posed to Byzantium. In the 1360s, the Turks continued to drive through Thrace, taking Byzantine, Bulgarian and Serbian settlements. Plea to the West Like his predecessors Alexios I Komnenos and Michael VIII, John V now turned to the Pope and offered the promise of a Union of the two Churches in the hopes of receiving military assistance. As a guarantee of compliance, John V offered his son, Manuel. In the past, Byzantium's cry for assistance were answered with mixed results — pillaging Crusaders would sack both friend and foe but the First Crusade had been largely beneficial and no doubt John V envisioned a repeat of such a Crusade. This time, however, the Papacy was unmoved by the calamity facing the Byzantine Empire.Mango, p. 269 Fortunately for John V, he had other European connections — his mother was Anna of Savoy, and her nephew (being John V's cousin) was concerned for the safety of his Greek counterpart. Sailing from Venice in June 1366 with dreams of initiating yet another Crusade, Amadeo VI of Savoy arrived at and seized the fortress of Gallipoli from the Ottomans and handed it back to the Byzantines, hoping that this would stem the tide of Turkish emigration into Thrace. However, the Turks had by now firmly established themselves in Thrace. Amadeo and John spent much time between 1367 and 1369 thinking of ways to stave off defeat. Amadeo returned to Europe via Rome and brought with him Byzantine envoys. The Pope again was uninterested, but called for John V to visit him. In 1369, when the Ottomans finally captured Adrianople (though some sources indicate 1365), John V rushed to Rome and confessed his Catholic faith both privately and at a public spectacle. Nevertheless, in 1371 John V returned empty-handed, having humiliated himself and done nothing to improve the deteriorating situation in the Balkans. Ottoman vassalage of John V In 1371, the Serbs mustered their strength and prepared to launch an attack to drive back the Turks from Thrace. In a crushing victory, the Ottomans annihilated the Serbian army at the Battle of Maritsa, and in its aftermath, many surviving lords submitted to the Ottoman Sultan Murad I. Byzantium was in no better position and after taking Serres from the defeated Serbs, John V swore allegiance as a vassal to Murad.Mango, p. 270 Third Palaiologan Civil War, 1373–1394 John V's rule was an unhappy one, resulting in his vassalage to Murad I. However, it must have been all the more worse when his eldest son and heir to the throne Andronikos IV Palaiologos rebelled against his father in 1373. Curiously, this rebellion coincided with the rebellion of Murad I's son, Savci Celebi and the two worked towards fomenting revolution in their peoples. Consequently, both the Byzantine and Ottoman rulers were facing their sons and as a result, coordinated efforts were made to defeat both. John V had his eldest son, Andronikos IV, along with the latter's son, John VII, partially blinded, while Murad I defeated his son, Savci, and had him executed.Mango, p. 271 Manuel, the second son of John V, was made co-emperor and heir to the throne. Unfortunately for John V, Andronikos IV and his son John VII escaped. With Genoan and Turkish aid, they returned to Constantinople and succeeded in overthrowing John V, imprisoning him and Manuel. In exchange for Ottoman aid, Andronikos IV handed the fortress of Gallipoli over to the Ottomans, thus rendering the only genuine European aid, provided by Amadeo of Savoy, useless. Again, prison break became the next event with John V and Manuel escaping Constantinople, offering the Ottoman Sultan higher tribute than normally paid, in return for help in taking over Constantinople. Andronikos IV, having been beaten yet again, evaded capture and slipped into the Genoese district of Galata with his family and hostages. John V, only interested in securing his throne and stability, came to conclude a pact with Andronikos IV in 1381, recognizing him as heir with John VII as heir apparent, thus removing Manuel from the line of succession. Naturally, Manuel felt betrayed by this move which demoted him from co-emperor. Returning to Thessalonica in 1382, he rebelled and established his rule over Thessaly and Epirus, thus \\"expanding\\" the Empire, at least nominally, and thereby catching the Ottoman Sultan's attention. Murad I besieged Thessalonica in 1383, beginning a siege that would last until 1387. Meanwhile, Andronikos IV died and his son, John VII, began quarreling with his grandfather, John V. With Thessalonica surrendering in 1387 and his position rather hopeless, Manuel returned to John V and, with the Sultan's assent, began making conciliatory offers to his father.Mango, p. 272 John V realized that accepting his second son back would cause his grandson to rebel in turn, and therefore he simply kept Manuel in exile in Lemnos. Eventually, John VII did rebel against his grandfather — news of Manuel's arrival at Constantinople and John V's reconciliation talks with him prompted John VII to head to Genoa and then to the new Ottoman Sultan, Bayezid the Thunderbolt, to seek aid in order to topple John V. John VII's rebellion succeeded initially, taking Constantinople from John V, but Manuel countered by rousing the rest of the empire and its few remaining military assets and turned them against John VII. Manuel also received aid from the Knights of St. John stationed at Rhodes, where he \\"donated\\" religious relics made of precious metals to them for their support. John refused to give up his right to rule as Emperor of Byzantium until his death in 1408. By then however, the Ottoman Sultan Bayezid had recognized Manuel II Palaiologos as co-emperor of Byzantium alongside his father John V, and finally, when John V died in 1391, as sole Emperor.Mango, p. 273 Manuel II Palaiologos, 1391–1420 Byzantium in 1389.Mango, p. 264 Thrace was lost in the previous three decades. Manuel II's reign saw another temporary respite for the Byzantines. For an Empire in such trouble, he succeeded in retaking some territory and held it to the end of his reign. His limited success largely came through the resurrection of Mongol Power in the East and the great friendship achieved between Manuel II and Mehmed I. However, he lived long enough to see his son undo much of his achievements. Vassalage to 1394 Manuel II's first priority was to establish an agreement with Bayezid I. John VII was a favorite of Bayezid so Manuel II was in a dangerous position. He eventually sealed an agreement. However, the Ottoman Sultan became infuriated by Manuel II's attempts to reconcile his nephew John VII. Manuel was concerned that John VII might once again launch a coup against him so wished to end the threat diplomatically. Bayezid ordered Manuel's execution, but then reduced his furious response and instead demanded that Constantinople build another Mosque and that a colony of Turks be established. Rebellion; Byzantium survives, 1394–1402 Manuel's next steps were bold and seemingly foolish — not only did he refuse to pay the Sultan tribute, he refused to answer the Sultan's messages and Bayezid set about laying siege to Constantinople. In 1394, his siege began and would continue for eight years. Manuel II realized that while the city could endure a half-hearted blockade, it did not have the military assets to man the walls of Constantinople. At first, the situation was not so dire — a massive counter-attack by the West was to be launched as the Crusade of Nicopolis.Mango, p. 274 In a titanic battle, Bayezid force-marched his army to a stunning yet costly victory. Thousands were killed, but now Bayezid was able to turn his armies fully against Constantinople. The situation was dire; so much so that John VII, Manuel's dire opponent, was left in charge of Constantinople. He made one grand tour of Europe in 1399, stopping at Venice, Padua, Milan, Paris and London, where he met the English King Henry IV; in England, he was well received and treated to a jousting tournament. However, Manuel was unable to secure any help from Western Christendom. In the end, it would be Eastern Islam that would come to Constantinople's aid — Timur, the Khan of the Chagatai Mongols led his army deep into Anatolia, decisively defeating Bayezid and his exhausted army in 1402 near Ankara. The defeat caused a panic amongst the Turks in Anatolia, who frantically began crossing over to Europe, albeit with hired Byzantine ships. Manuel, who was still in Europe, arrived in 1403 to a welcoming sight — Constantinople free from Ottoman siege. John VII remained loyal, handing back the capital and even taking Thessalonica back from the Ottomans. Ottoman Interregnum, 1402–13 Manuel II lived to 75 years of age The defeat of the Ottomans considerably changed the mood within Constantinople. The rewards reaped by the Empire were outstanding considering that only a short time had passed since the city (and possibly the Empire itself) stood on the brink of destruction. John VII appeared to have achieved numerous other benefits for Byzantium. The first was a non-aggression treaty between the local Christian powers (who were also free from Ottoman servitude), meaning that the disasters of Andronikos III's later rule would not be repeated. Next were a treaty between Byzantium and the successor of Bayezid, Süleyman who was in Asia Minor, confirming Byzantium's freedom from paying tribute. The Empire also gained Mount Athos and coastal land of the Black Sea from Constantinople to Varna. As an added bonus, Imperial authority was asserted over a number of Aegean Islands. The importance of the latter should not be underestimated as these would serve in the future as refuge for any seeking to escape Ottoman expansion, even if only as a temporary refuge. Bayezid's sons lost no time fighting each other for their father's shattered realm. By 1413, Mehmed I had emerged as the victor. However, the Byzantines had made sure to support the victor and Mehmed I did not forget the kindness of the Byzantines and was able to \\"control\\" his Turk subjects from expanding into Byzantine territory. Resumption of hostilities Manuel II Palaiologos was 70 years of age in 1421 and believed that the time had come for him to retire and give his eldest son, John VIII, the opportunity to rule with a more aggressive manner than he had done so. At the same time, a far less restrained Murad II, son of Mehmed I, came to the Ottoman throne in May of that year. With two men uninterested in diplomacy on the thrones of Byzantium and the Ottoman Sultanate, war was inevitable. The Byzantines were the first to make a move when John VIII and his advisors made a risky decision by inciting a rebellion within the Ottoman Sultanate. In August 1421, they backed a man named Mustafa who claimed to be a long lost son of Bayezid the Thunderbolt. In Europe, Mustafa's rebellion worked well and he gathered some support. However, in August 1422, Murad II had this rebellion crushed and Mustafa received the traditional execution (hanging) shortly after, something any rebel would have expected. Murad II was enraged and had an army sent to Constantinople and to Thessalonika, the latter falling in 1430. Murad II was unable to take Constantinople by force. Nonetheless, the situation in the Capital was dire enough for Manuel II to come out of retirement and incite yet another rebellion in Asia Minor under Murad II's brother, Kucuk Mustafa. Initial rebel success, including a siege of Bursa was too much for Murad II to ignore so the siege of Constantinople was lifted to deal with this threat, and to the Byzantines' greatest despair, dealt with it indeed. Manuel II was now out of tricks to save the erroneous rule of his son, John VIII. In September 1423, Thessalonika was surrendered to the Venetians, no doubt hoping to draw in the Western Powers into crusading mode and, if not, at least their wealth would enable them to defend it better. In February 1424, Manuel II Palaiologos re-established Byzantium as a vassal of the Ottomans — 300,000 silver coins were to be paid to the Sultan on annual basis. That the Empire managed to accomplish this at its lowest ebb is remarkable. Nonetheless until the 1450s, the Ottomans would not make any concerted efforts to overcome the walls of Constantinople, and the city retained a tenuous security for the next two decades.  John VIII takes over  Medal of the Emperor John VIII Palaiologos during his visit to Florence, by Pisanello (1438). The legend reads, in Greek: \\"John the Palaiologos, basileus and autokrator of the Romans\\". Manuel II's final years saw his gains wasted and the Empire status quo ante 1391. John VIII was still hopeful that he could emulate his Father's success and more. Like his predecessors, his attempts were in vain. And just like his predecessors, he relied too heavily on a Pope not willingly to give, only take; take that is, the Church of a wretched state surrounded by the Ottomans, soon-to-be Christendom's direst foe. Union with Rome Uniting the Church of Byzantium with that of Rome was a simple matter, since all the bargaining chips were in the hands of the Roman Catholic West. John VIII, as the de facto head of the Byzantine Church ordered the Byzantine Church to accept Papal primacy and declared that the Filioque dispute arose from semantic confusion. Few on Byzantium's side were impressed with the Union between 1438 and 1439 held in Ferrara and Florence, not only at the terms at which the Byzantine Church had to stoop to, but also at the non-existent aid to Byzantium. One can safely say that the most notable effect of the Union was the increased resentment between Byzantium's populace and the Imperial government.  Varna  In the late 1440s, the Ottomans experienced difficulty in bringing their Christian vassals in the Balkans into line. Hungary began launching successful campaigns against the Turks in Serbia, leading to the Serbian Despot and the Albanian resistance leader George Kastrioti Skanderbeg into direct opposition with their former masters. This led to one of the last great Crusades of a united Western Christendom — Crusade of Varna. Murad II was in no position to stop these troublesome westerners since he was overwhelmed with problems by easterners in Anatolia, the core of the Ottoman realm. Therefore, Murad hastily concluded a peace treaty in the Balkans. The Hungarians soon broke the treaty, but at Varna a hastily assembled Ottoman army crushed the Crusaders and left the Balkans at the mercy of Ottoman vengeance. John VIII died in 1448. His reign lasted two decades. His achievement was the continued survival of the Empire. Yet Byzantium was now hanging by a thread. With insufficient military manpower for its own defense, an economy ruined by years of warfare, a depopulated capital, and insufficient territory to provide a basis for recovery, the Empire's position was becoming untenable. John was severely constrained by his circumstances, and proved unable to improve the fortunes of the state. He was succeeded by his brother Constantine XI. The new emperor would be Byzantium's last sovereign ruler.  Constantine XI  Constantine's reign was short; from 1448 (some sources say 1449) until 1453. Constantine XI, like many of his predecessors who took the Union between Eastern and Western Christendom seriously, lived as a Catholic. Not much is known of his reign, except that he died with his soldiers in the final fight for Constantinople. Defiance, defence and defeat Constantine XI depicted in semi-classical armour. Constantine XI was the Despot of the Morea before his ascension to the throne. From this position, he had continued the aggressive policies of his father and his brothers against the Ottomans and their vassals, the Duchy of Athens, but had been forced to back down by Murad II. In 1451, Mehmed II succeeded his father Murad. Upon his succession to the throne, he received a demand by Constantine XI for subsidies, coupled with a threat to rebel if these were not met. Mehmed II responded with these bold declarations by building a fortress on the European side of the Bosporus in order to better control traffic through the Bosporus. Mehmed II assembled a huge army to assail Constantinople's landward walls — some sources suggest 80,000 soldiers, while others suggest figures as high as 100,000 or even 200,000, including camp followers. A major feature of the Ottoman army was its high-quality artillery. Among others, it featured a number of \\"super-cannons\\" built by Orban, a Hungarian engineer who had originally offered his services to Constantine, who rejected them for lack of money. After the rejection of terms of surrender by Constantine, the siege began on April 2, 1453, with Ottoman cannon firing from April 6. The defenders were few, but the mighty walls allowed them to withstand the siege for some time. Finally however, on May 29, the Ottomans achieved a breach, and the city fell. Constantine XI charged at the oncoming Ottoman army; the last Roman Emperor died fighting, and since his body was never recognized, is assumed to have been buried in a mass grave. Conclusion Constantine's rule is hard to assess due to the shortness of his reign. As a Despot, he had shown ability, but the fall of the Empire to the Turks was by his time inevitable, no matter how able and energetic an Emperor sat on the throne. What is most remembered of him is the stubborn defence of his city against the odds, and his death in battle, through which he entered popular legend. Despite his Catholic confession, he is viewed as a saint by many Orthodox, and many legends were created about the ultimate fate of the last Constantine. Learning under the Palaiologoi Second Byzantine/Palaiologan Renaissance Despite much chaos in the Empire, the Byzantines experienced a revival in culture and art within their domain. Towards the 14th century, as the Empire entered into a phase of terminal crisis, such achievements became less valued. All was not lost for these seemingly rejected scholars — many in Italy who had been opened up to Byzantium by the maritime expansions of Genoa and Venice came to appreciate their achievements, facilitating the Renaissance. As such these scholars found themselves in Italian institutions, expressing their Greco-Roman culture for pay. Immigration to Italy was made less attractive by the idea of abandoning the Orthodox faith to practice Catholicism. Nonetheless, a significant and increasing number of Greeks began travelling to Italy, first temporarily to Italian colonies such as Crete or Cyprus before returning to Byzantium, then as the Empire began to fail horribly, in more permanent manner. The Fall of Constantinople was marked by large numbers of Greek refugees escaping Turkic rule into Europe via Italy and thus accelerating the Renaissance. Restoration of the Classics Classical literature that was studied included mythical figures such as Dionysus. The Fourth Crusade saw the destruction of many homes in Constantinople and much of the city on fire. It is difficult to determine what books were burned in the libraries of Constantinople, though one can only imagine that few would be available today were it not for the works of Demetrius Triclinius, Manuel Moschopoulos, Thomas Magister and Maximos Planudes. New editions of poets, such as Hesiod and Pindar, were made and their metric systems were reconstructed with competence. They wrote about such works as Scholia and Pindar. Countless works are also included, such as the tragedians of Sophocles and Euripides, Ptolemy's Geography, Nonnus of Panaopolis' Dionysiaca, edits and \\"rediscoveries\\" on Plutarch and the Greek Anthology of epigrams. Works assembled by Theodore Metochites at the Monastery of Chora can be found in the libraries of Istanbul, Oxford, the Vatican and even Paris. Greek Byzantium In the past, at its full height, the Byzantine Empire was composed of many territories, stretching from modern-day Iraq to modern-day Spain. As the Empire's borders shrunk, so too had its cultural diversity. By the late 13th century, the Empire consisted almost exclusively of traditionally Greek territory (inhabited by Greeks since Antiquity). Consequently, this Greek culture soon came to dominate the Empire and the works of the Classical age such as those of Sophocles and Theocritus were meticulously copied and annotated. Notable philosophers include Planudes who characterized the interest in Science and Mathematics at the time. Astronomy was also a field of interest, as Nicephorus Gregoras illustrates with his proposal to modify the calendar before changes were put in place by the Gregorian reform. Moreover, some prominent personalities also proposed the change of the Imperial title to 'Emperor of the Hellenes', instead of Romans. This enthusiasm for the glorious past, contained elements that were also present in the movement that led to the creation of the modern Greek state, in 1830, after four centuries of Ottoman rule.Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Vasiliev History of the Byzantine Empire, 324-1453, Vol. 2. Univ of Wisconsin Press, 1952, , p. 582 Persian science enters, circa 1300 At the time, astrologists had to rely on Ptolemy's tables for calculations. However, these proved to be inaccurate when compared to Arab astronomy. As a result, Persian tables were used more often, even if in conjunction with Ptolemy's. The acceptance of Arab astronomy was made harder by the fact that it had to be translated, and only entered through \\"lowlier social channels\\", namely by men who travelled between Constantinople and Trebizond. Such men included Gregory Choniades and his follower George Chrysokokkes, who acquainted themselves with this science. By the mid 14th century, when Byzantium was overwhelmed with troubles, the tables of Ptolemy were deemed by professionals as inadequate and slowly abandoned for Persian tables. Despite this, Persian works such as those on astrolabe were translated into Greek as early as 1309. In 1352, Theodore Metochites published his thoughts using Persian and Ptolemaic tables. Such works, while being non- Christian and in many cases non-Hellenistic, were cultivated by the Greek Orthodox ecclesiastics. Both Choniades and Metochites established themselves in the Greek Orthodox Church; the former becoming Bishop of Tabriz and the latter the head of the Patriarchal school. Plethon's final resting place was moved to the Tempio Malatestiano in Rimini, Italy by his Italian disciples. Not all thinkers were welcome in Byzantium. Some who opened their minds to other beliefs would have strayed from the \\"one true Religion\\", as the Byzantines would have seen it. One such example is that of Plethon. His works on computational astronomy using Hebrew and Persian tables were overshadowed by the neo-pagan beliefs he adopted in his old age. He proclaimed his belief in the \\"Seven Wise Men\\", the message of Zoroaster and Fatalism. Consequently, his work on a modified Greek Pantheon, The Laws was burnt by the Patriarch of Constantinople. Plethon's ashes repose in the Tempio Malatestiano of Rimini. Others went so far as to suggest that Byzantium would not live forever — a fundamental belief for every subject of the Byzantine Orthodox Church. Metochites did not see Byzantine civilization as superior to others and even considered the \\"infidel\\" Tatars as more enlightened in some aspects, such as morality, than his Christian co-religionists. Patronage Philosophers had to find ways of bringing food to the table. The most common occupation in the Byzantine Empire would have either been agriculturally-based or, earlier in the Empire, trade-based. In contrast, philosophers needed patronage in order to survive. The most important source was from the Imperial court, especially before the destructive civil wars that were characterized by Andronikos III and his son John V. Other sources were from minor courts, from the wealthy, and from the Church, if not from individual Church clergy, although only bishops had such resources. As the Empire descended into chaos, it could not spare any finances in its efforts to defend its borders. Study in the fields of science and mathematics naturally disappeared from the minds of those whose lands were raided and seized. It was due to this lack of patronage that led many scholars to flee to the West. Remarkable travels were recorded by John Argyropoulos, Constance, Manuel Chrysoloras, who between them had travelled to Florence, Pavia, Rome, Padua and Milan. The end of the Byzantine Empire coincided with the beginning of the Renaissance.  Conclusion  The end of the Byzantine Empire did not seem inevitable to contemporaries. As late as 1444, a mere nine years before the Fall of Constantinople, there were high hopes that the Turks would be driven out of Europe. The Byzantines that pinned their dreams of restoration on the West had hoped that they could reap the benefits of another \\"First Crusade\\" that would cut a swathe through Asia Minor and allow Byzantine troops to re-occupy the empire's ancient heartlands. However, by the late 14th century, the Byzantine Empire did not possess sufficient resources for the task, and in any case such Western undertakings would have required Byzantium to submit to Rome. If the price for political freedom was religious freedom, certain emperors such as Michael VIII were willing to pay it. In the long run though, the Byzantines were not prepared to surrender their ancient customs and beliefs willingly. The proximate cause of the problem lay in Byzantium's numerous enemies, who combined during the course of the 14th century to overwhelm what remained of the empire's core territories. With each passing decade, the Byzantine Empire became weaker and lost more land. There were fewer resources available to deal with the Empire's opponents. Her power base was consequently ruined. While the empire had experienced difficulties before (in the 8th century much of Byzantium's lands were occupied by Avars and Arabs), by the later 14th century the empire no longer possessed any significant territories (such as Asia Minor) to form the basis of a recovery. As a result, many attempts at driving back the Ottomans and Bulgarians failed, while the lack of territory, revenue and manpower meant that Byzantium's armies became increasingly obsolete and outnumbered. However, the most serious problems arose from the internal political and military organisation of the empire. The empire's political system, based as it was around an autocratic and semi-divine emperor who exercised absolute power, had become obsolete, while the civil wars the system produced severely weakened the empire from within, leaving it disastrously exposed to outside attack. Furthermore, the empire's military system had become increasingly disorganised and chaotic, following the demise of the theme system in the 11th–13th centuries. The result was persistent failure and defeat on every frontier. Byzantium could only lose and decline for so long before it destroyed her; by the late 14th century, the situation had become so severe that Byzantium surrendered her political independence. By the mid 15th century, restoring both the religious and the political freedom of Byzantium was ultimately an impossible cause.

It was endemic to Sri Lanka. It is only known from the type series consisting of three old museum specimens. Etymology The specific name zal is a Polish word that, according to Arthur Rubinstein, refers to \\"sadness, nostalgia, regret, burning hurt, and yet something else\\". This name was chosen by the authors of the species to express their \\"sadness and frustration at the loss of this and so many other endemic amphibians in Sri Lanka\\". Description The type series consists of three adult males measuring in snout–vent length. The body is stout. The snout is bluntly angled dorsally and rounded in profile. The tympanum is visible and the supratympanic fold is prominent. The canthal edges are sharp. Skin is shagreened to granular. The fingers have dermal fringes whereas the toes are medially webbed. The upper parts of the alcohol-preserved specimens are light brown with dark-brown blotches and about five white spots. The underside is pale yellow. The holotype was originally identified as Ixalus minutus, an unpublished name. One of the paratypes is a former syntype of Pseudophilautus variabilis, and the other was a syntype of Pseudophilautus microtympanum. Distribution and conservation The types are only known to have been collected from \\"Ceylon\\", a rather general location. All were identified as different species, suggesting that Pseudophilautus zal might have had a wide distribution. No other specimens are known, despite extensive field surveys in more recent times. The habitat requirements of this species are unknown. The reasons for its demise are also unknown, but probably involved habitat loss.

Description Pseudophilautus zimmeri is only known from the holotype, an adult male measuring in snout–vent length. The canthal edges are sharp, and the supra-tympanic fold is prominent; the tympanum is visible. The body is slender. The dorsum bears a few scattered glandular warts. The toes are medially webbed, whereas the fingers have dermal fringes. Pseudophilautus zimmeri is most similar to Pseudophilautus fulvus. Habitat and conservation Habitat of this species is unknown. The holotype was collected from \\"Point de Galle\\", corresponding to the present-day Galle. The species has never been recorded again, despite extensive surveys.

It is known under numerous common names, including common tree frog, four- lined tree frog, golden tree frog or striped tree frog. Many past authors have united it with the common Indian tree frog in P. maculatus (or Rhacophorus maculatus, as was common in older times), but today they are generally considered distinct species. In its native range, it is also called \\"white- lipped tree frog\\", but this name is otherwise applied to a species of true tree frogs (family Hylidae). Polypedates leucomystax is not considered a threatened species by the IUCN. It is in fact a species complex containing various cryptic species within it. Range Previously, P. leucomystex was thought to distribute below the Red River of Vietnam and in western Yunnan, while P. megacephalus can be found above the Red River and in Northeast India. However, recent genetic studies revealed that the natural barriers between these species are the Isthmus of Kra and the Tenasserim Range, where P. leucomystax can be found below the isthmus and west of the range. The Polypedates leucomystax complex began diverging during the Pliocene, and spread quickly after the Pleistocene due to human activity.KURAISHI, N., MATSUI, M., HAMIDY, A., BELABUT, D.

Description Mating frogs with foam nest Polypedates leucomystax can reach approximately a snout–vent length of in males, of in females.Ecology Asia Body of these rather small shrub frogs is moderately slender, ovoid, slightly flattened above, with sharply pointed tail. The skin on the upper side is smooth. The body colour is rather variable, with various shades of gray, green, yellow, reddish or dark brown. Usually it is irregularly mottled, often with four stripes along the back. The tip of snout sometimes shows a distinct white spot. Eyes are at the side of the head. The hind feet are webbed. The feet have clear, large cushions as usual with leaf frogs.Amphibian and Reptiles of Peninsular Malaysia - Polypedates leucomystax Biology In the damp areas of the propagation, these frogs are present all year round. In drier environments, the period usually restricts to the beginning of the rainy season. The mating takes place at the margins of shallow pools, where the males first arrive and call the females with a distinctive loud, duck-like sound. The female places between 100 and 400 eggs in a protective foam nest that is attached to vegetation or other objects above the water surface. The eggs hatch after 3 to 4 days. The tadpoles develop inside the foam nest and then fall into the water. They develop into adult frogs in about 7 weeks. In captivity This species of tree frog is commonly kept in captivity in vivariums and terrariums by both hobbyists and professional.

Its common name is Omei whipping frog or Omei treefrog, in reference to its type locality, Mount Emei () in Sichuan. It is found in southern and central China in Yunnan, Sichuan, Guangxi, Guizhou, Hunan, and Hubei provinces. It is a relatively common frog that inhabits forests, and sometimes farmland. It breeds in still water (pools and ponds). Agriculture and logging are threats to this species. Description Zhangixalus omeimontis are moderately large frogs: males grow to a snout–vent length of about and females to . Maximum sizes can be even higher, reaching at least in males and in females. They tend to be bigger and older at cooler sites (i.e., at higher altitudes). Maximum age is at least eight years. Tadpoles are up to in length. Reproduction Zhangixalus omeimontis breed between mid-April and late July. Breeding takes place during night-time. Males arrive before females, climbing in the vegetation close to a pond and calling while perched on stems or leaves. When a male spots an approaching female, it approaches the female and clasps her. The pair then moves to oviposition site above the pond. The female then makes a foam nest while the pair is in amplexus. In addition to the first male, several other males may join, forming a spawning group. The primary male often leaves the female before she has spawned all her eggs. Clutch size is several hundred eggs, with one study finding a range of 457–837 eggs. Eggs diameter is about ; diameter and clutch size are negatively correlated (big clutches tend to contain smaller eggs). Eggs hatch after about 12 to 17 days. The eggs are placed on upper leaf surfaces, facilitating the washing of tadpoles into breeding ponds by rainfall.

History  The origin of Láchar goes back to the times of the earliest human settlements and its situation in the fertile floodplain of the River Genil has made farming the main form of livelihood in the area for many centuries. Studies have revealed the existence of a Roman settlement in the area, \\"Los Hornillos\\", and a field of silos has been found which would have been for the storage of food. Near to \\"Lacen\\" (the name given to Láchar by the Romans), there are also other Roman remains, such as the \\"Villas Rusticae\\" in Adamucejo (or Lower Daimuz), and Daragoleja, which was under the administrative control of the Roman villa of Ilurco. In the Reconquest, the alquería or farmstead was burnt by the troops commanded by Álvaro de Luna (the Constable of Castile) and was finally conquered in 1492. Láchar had previously formed part of the Alquería of La Piedra (the Spanish translation of its Arabic name) which was owned by a wealthy Nasrid family from Boabdil's court. Cortijo of Láchar were granted to the ancestors of the Count of Benalúa, who owned it until 1897 when Don Julio Quesada de Cañaveral y Piédrola successfully made a claim of ownership resulting in the cortijo and all its adjoining land being passed to him.

Description Zhangixalus arvalis is a medium-sized treefrog; adult males measure and adult females in snout–vent length. The tympanum is visible, but it is dorsally and posteriorly concealed by the thin supratympanic fold. The fingers and the toes have well-developed discs and are webbed; webbing is weakly developed between the fingers but more prominent between the toes. Skin is granulated. The dorsum varies from dark green, green, yellowish-green, to nearly yellow. The upper lip is white, and the white color continues as a white stripe on the flanks; flank below the white stripe is dark purple. The lower lip and edge of gular region are silver gray to white. Habitat and conservation Zhangixalus arvalis occurs in disturbed lowland (elevations below ) agricultural areas where traditional farming practices prevails; it inhabits bamboo forests, orchards, sugar-cane fields, scrubland, and cultivated fields. Reproduction involves a lek-type mating system where males form a chorus group on twigs or leaves near canopy. Female selects a male and carries him down to the damp forest floor (usually a temporary pool), digs a hole, lays foamy eggs in the nest, and then covers the nest with decomposed bamboo leaves or other plant material.

For some time, it was believed that similar frogs from Indonesia and Malaysia also belonged to the present species. But this was found to be wrong, and the western relative is now known as R. cyanopunctatus.

Rhacophorus bipunctatus is a frog species in the moss frog family (Rhacophoridae) found from eastern India into Southeast Asia, possibly to southeastern China and south to Malaysia. Due to the identification problems surrounding this species, the eastern and southern limits of its range remain undetermined; all that is known is that the species certainly occurs in the border region of India, Bangladesh, China and Myanmar; its range might extend south to Malaysia, as similar frogs have been reported from Pahang.Bordoloi et al. (2007) This species is notable for having a highly confusing taxonomy, discussed in detail in the Taxonomy section below. It had its scientific name changed twice, was described under different names two times and more than 130 years apart, and has had a second species confused with it. Only in 2007, some degree of certainty about what kind of frog to which the name R. bipunctatus actually applies was achieved. Description R. bipunctatus is a smallish tree frog with a pointed snout and body length of about 37–60 mm when adult, with females being larger than males. Its back is intensely green to violet-brown in living animals; in preserved specimens, this becomes blue to violet. No conspicuous pattern is visible on the back, though there may be a few tiny whitish and/or dark speckles. The arms and legs have very faint darker bands. The sides, belly and toes are brilliant yellow, becoming dull pink in preserved specimens. Behind the arms, there is almost always a conspicuous large black spot on the flanks; towards the hind legs there may be another one or two such spots, but very rarely the flank spots are absent entirely. The well-developed webbing of the toes is bright orange-red and not spotted, becoming whitish in preserved specimens. The eyes are dull green, sometimes with yellow rims. It can be distinguished from R. rhodopus, with which it was long confused, by the larger size (R. rhodopus has a body length of about 31–55 mmInger et al. (1999), Bordoloi et al. (2007)) and unspotted back with at least some trace of green or olive, often being entirely green (R. rhodopus has a reddish-brownish back with darker spots and lacks greenish hues). In individuals of similar size, R. bipunctatus has a much larger head. Ecology and status Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist montane forests, subtropical or tropical high-altitude shrubland, intermittent rivers, freshwater marshes, intermittent freshwater marshes, plantations and rural gardens. It is known from altitudes of several hundreds of meters ASL to more than 2,000 meters ASL; it is unclear whether this species is ever found in the lowlands. The IUCN classified R. bipunctatus as a Species of Least Concern in 2004.van Dijk et al. (2004) However, they include R. rhodopus under the name. It is not known whether the true R. bipunctatus occurs across the whole of Southeast Asia like R. rhodopus; the available data indicate it is only known with certainty from a rather restricted area in the hills and mountains of the India-China-Myanmar border region, but the status of the similar frogs from Pahang in Malaysia needs to be determined. Therefore, it is probably most appropriate to consider this frog a Data Deficient species. Indeed, R. htunwini - a junior synonym of R. bipunctatus as it seems - was in fact evaluated as Data Deficient by the IUCN in 2006 for precisely these reasons.Stuart (2006) Taxonomy This frog has a highly convoluted taxonomy, even by the standards of the taxonomically confusing genus Rhacophorus. Believed at its discovery in 1870 to represent a population of the black- webbed tree frog (Rhacophorus reinwardtii),Jerdon (1870) it was first described in 1871 as R. maculatus by John Anderson.Anderson (1871) His five syntypes, from the Khasi Hills in India, were placed in the ZSI collection, with the numbers 2753, 2754, 2755, 2756, and 10291; seven other Khasi Hills specimens collected by Thomas C. Jerdon were deposited in the NMH and are also considered part of the syntypical series because they were referred to in Anderson's description. The ZSI specimens might subsequently have become lost; NMH specimen 1872.4.17.127, collected by Jerdon in 1870, was designated a lectotype in 2007. Multiple homonyms However, Polypedates maculatus, originally described by John E. Gray as Hyla maculata some decades earlierGrey (1830). Date is often given as \\"1833\\" but the volume in question was already out in 1830: Wheeler (1998). was known as Rhacophorus maculatus in the late 19th century. Thus it was a senior homonym, preoccupying Anderson's name. This was soon noticed and in 1882, George A. Boulenger proposed R. bimaculatus as a new name for Anderson's frogs.Boulenger (1882) But in 1927, Ernst Ahl realized the frog described by Wilhelm Peters as Leptomantis bimaculata in 1867Peters (1867) was also a member of Rhacophorus and thus Boulenger's replacement name was also preoccupied.Ahl (1927) Ahl solved the issue by establishing the currently valid name, Rhacophorus bipunctatus, for the frog species that had first come to the notice of scientists 50 years earlier. R. rhodopus and R. htunwini Often, R. rhodopus (described in 1960Liu & Hu (1960). Date is often given as \\"1959\\" but the description was not published until the next year. The species diagnosis is reproduced in English in Bordoloi et al. (2007).) is considered a junior synonym of the present species. However, when proposing this synonymy in 1999,Inger et al. (1999) neither the holotypes nor verified specimen from the type locality were examined. In fact, the alleged specimens of R. bipunctatus were from localities where that species is not known to occur. When the approproate comparisons were finally done almost 10 years later, it turned out the R. rhodopus actually refers to the frogs described as R. namdaphaensis in 1985,Sarkar & Sanyal (1985) which therefore is properly known by the older name R. rhodopus. This confusion has had further consequences. In 2005, a moss frog similar to R. rhodopus - then known as R. bipunctatus and R. namdaphaensis - was described as Htun Win's tree frog (Rhacophorus htunwini).Wilkinson et al. (2005) But the describers believed that the taxon R. rhodopus was a junior synonym of R. bipunctatus; therefore, they compared the new species only with misidentified R. rhodopus, but not with the actual R. bipunctatus. That was still fortuitous, however, as they did not compare their \\"new\\" species to frogs assigned to the taxon R. namdaphaensis (as they might have wanted to, given the similarities and close geographic proximity). In any case, this situation was resolved in 2007, when the differences between R. htunwini and the original R. bipunctatus were found to be too slight and varied too much between individuals to consider the former anything but a junior synonym of the latter. Thus, the failure to compare R. rhodopus with the original type specimens of R. bipunctatus led to the long-known species being described once again under a new name, more than 130 years after it first became known to science. There are still a few doubts regarding the taxonomy of all these frogs, given they look quite similar and are partly sympatric. Ancient DNA sequence analyses of the original type specimens would be necessary to resolve the remaining questions.

It is found in Southeast Asia and southern China. Because of confusion with other species (Kurixalus odontotarsus, Kurixalus verrucosus), the distribution is not well mapped but includes Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, and China. Populations from Hainan were formerly treated as a separate species, Rhacophorus hainanus (Hainan small treefrog), but molecular data suggest they are conspecific with Kurixalus bisacculus. Description Males from Thailand measure in snout–vent length; males from the Cardamon Mountains (Cambodia) measure in snout–vent length. The female paratype measures in snout–vent length. The dorsum is brown with some darker markings; the venter is whitish to yellowish white. The tympanum is large. The snout is pointed at tip and extends into a dermal projection, especially in females. All fingers have rudiments of webbing. The toes are up to three-fourths webbed. The chin, venter, and undersides of femurs are granulate. The undersides of the arms and tarsi have a row of tubercles, continuing onto the outer digits. Specimens from Hainan possess an internal vocal sac, whereas specimens from Thailand have an external one. In light of molecular evidence, this difference is considered to represent intraspecific variation. Habitat and conservation Kurixalus bisacculus is found in vegetation or arboreally. The IUCN assessment from 2004 predates the revision of the species boundaries of Kurixalus bisacculus and its closest relatives. At the time, it was considered a common species that could be threatened by wildfires.

It has several common names: small tree frog, Boulenger's tree frog, small gliding frog, and winged gliding frog. After its original description in 1883 by George Albert Boulenger, the frog was rediscovered in Coorg in 2000 and has since been found in many parts of the Western Ghats around southern Karnataka and northern Kerala. Along with R. malabaricus, it is one of the few anuran amphibians in India that constructs its nest above the ground using leaves. Description Nest of Rhacophorus lateralis in a leaf—along with R. malabaricus, this is one of the few amphibians from India that lays its eggs in multiple leaves above the ground. The frog was described by George Albert Boulenger in 1883 based on a single specimen from \\"Malabar\\" (present-day Kerala) collected by Richard Henry Beddome with a second specimen in the Indian Museum from Koppa in Chikmagalur collected by W. M. Daly, then resident in Kadur. Several later surveys did not report the species until its rediscovery in 2000 in the course of an expedition to the Western Ghats by a team from University of Aberdeen. The rediscovery was based on two adult females and an unsexed metamorph specimen collected from Lakunda estate in Virajpet taluka in South Kodagu. The frog is slender with a short head and snout and a distinct canthus rostralis. The nostrils are nearer to the tip of the snout than to the eye. The eyes are large with the tympanum half the diameter of the eye and a distinct supratympanic fold. The fingers and toes have an enlarged disc possessing circummarginal grooves. The upper portion (dorsum) is smooth, the belly is granular and a characteristic dorsolateral yellow streak on either side of the upper body from the nostril to the groin is distinctive. Colour variations even within the same individual have been reported and have been attributed to stress. Repeated handling reduces colour change. Green and brown colour variations have been described. Individuals with green upperparts have the green colour interspersed with fine, sky-blue spots. The individuals with brown dorsa have darker brown spots; no demarcating blue line borders the yellow stripe from the eye to the groin. Phylogenetic studies show it to be closely related to Rhacophorus malabaricus.Individuals can change colour between brown and green Habitat The species has been reported from sholas in Eravikulam National Park and Kudremukh National Park, plantations in Kodagu and Chikkamagaluru in Karnataka and Wayanad in Kerala and adjoining subtropical evergreen forests in the southern Western Ghats. It is endemic to this region. It has often been reported in association with Rhacophorus malabaricus. Threats Habitat loss due to changing agricultural practices, use of pesticides, and logging of its natural forest habitat are major threats to this species.

Students come from all over Cincinnati in addition to students from northern Kentucky and other parts of Ohio. St. Rita's is one of the first schools in the country to develop a program for dyspraxic children, sometimes referred to as \\"global\\" apraxia. The program teaches to the students communication disabilities (oral-buccofacial apraxia) and encompasses each student's global dyspraxic apraxia disabilities that affect the student's fine and gross motor skills with their motor planning; sequencing and motor- processing abilities (which include but is not limited to ideomotor, ideation, limb-kinetic and ocular motor apraxias). The school's Montessori pre-school program is designed to meet the development needs of hearing and deaf children, starting at 3 years of age. The school also features an elementary, high school, and Career Plus programs. Athletics St. Rita's competes with area schools in basketball and volleyball. In 1962, the high school division petitioned the Greater Catholic League to compete in football at the reserve level. Later, the high school became a member of the Girls Greater Cincinnati League. Due to small class sizes, in 2017/2018 the school switched to intramural sports and did not compete competitively. Fundraising Like many Greater Cincinnati Catholic parishes, major funding comes from annual festivals. The St. Rita Fest began in 1916 but stopped in 2016 It was one of the area's largest. The school still holds a Grand Raffle and a scholarship benefit dinner.

It is endemic to Taiwan, where it has a wide distribution in hilly areas. Common names Moltrecht's green treefrog, Moltrecht's treefrog, Taiwan treefrog, and Nantou flying frog have been coined for it. Etymology The specific name moltrechti honors , a Latvian entomologist, lepidopterist, and ophthalmologist; while stationed in Vladivostok he also traveled and collected in Taiwan. Description Zhangixalus moltrechti is a medium-sized tree frog, females are in snout-vent length; males are slightly smaller, . The finger and toe tips have well-developed discs. Skin is smooth. The overall coloration is green; some individuals have few white spots. The belly is white yellow. The hidden surfaces of the hind legs are red or orange with black spots. The iris is orange red. Habitat and conservation Zhangixalus moltrechti occurs in forests, orchards, and tea plantations at elevations below . Breeding takes place in bodies of standing water, such as ponds, pools, cisterns, and blocked roadside ditches. It may also breed in pools of intermittent streams, potholes, and streamside pools. High-elevation (~) populations breed in spring and summer (April–September), whereas low-elevation (<) populations breed in late autumn to early spring (October–March); mid-elevation populations breed throughout the year, with peak in spring. The eggs are laid in foam nests above the water, attached to branches of trees, bushes, or walls. Zhangixalus moltrechti is a common and adaptable species that is not facing significant threats. It occurs in several protected areas.

It occurs in south-eastern Asia, from India to southern China, and south to Malaysia. Previously unknown from Laos, it has now been found in Phongsali Province and at Luang Prabang.van Dijk et al. (2004), Bordoloi et al. (2007) Its taxonomy is disputed. DescriptionBordoloi et al. (2007) R. rhodopus is a smallish tree frog with a pointed snout and body length of about 31–55 mm when adult, with females being larger than males. Its back is reddish-, pinkish-, or yellowich-brown without any green hues in living animals; in preserved specimens this becomes purplish brown. There are many darker spots all over the back, usually forming an X-shaped pattern behind the head and sometimes stripes across the lower back. Sometimes, there are a few large white spots on the back, also.Inger et al. (1999) The hind legs and the upper sides of the arms are for the most part or entirely the color of the back; there are usually dark bands across the upperside of arms and hind legs. The sides, belly and toes are dark yellow, becoming dark pink in preserved specimens. Behind the arms, there is almost always a conspicuous large black spot on the flanks. The well-developed webbing of the toes is bright orange-red and not spotted. The eyes are light brown. It can be distinguished from R. bipunctatus, with which it was long confused, by the smaller size (R. bipunctatus has a body length of about 37–60 mm) and spotted brown back without any green or olive (R. bipunctatus has a bright green to brownish green back without darker spotting). In individuals of similar size, R. bipunctatus has a much larger head. Ecology and status Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests, subtropical or tropical moist montane forests, and intermittent freshwater marshes. It occurs from nearly sea level to altitudes of at least 1,500 m ASL.Dutta et al. (2004), van Dijk et al. (2004) R. rhodopus was included in the IUCN status assessment for R. bipunctatus, with which it was then considered synonymous, and assessed as a Species of Least Concern due to its wide range in 2004.van Dijk et al. (2004) R. namdaphaensis, which refers to the same frogs as R. rhodopus, was assessed as a Data Deficient species in 2004, due to uncertainties about the limits of its distribution.Dutta et al. (2004) Altogether, when R. rhodopus is accepted as a valid species (including R. namdaphaensis), it would be of Least Concern, meaning it is not threatened. Taxonomy R. rhodopus was described in 1960, based on specimens from Mengyang in the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture of Yunnan, China; the holotype is in the CIB, specimen 571171.Liu & Hu (1960). Date is often given as \\"1959\\" but the description was not published until the next year. The species diagnosis is reproduced in English in Bordoloi et al. (2007). Subsequently, frogs that matched the description of R. rhodopus were also found at Chiang Mai and in the Doi Chiang Dao mountains (Thailand), Buon Luoi (Vietnam), and Arunachal Pradesh (India). The latter were described as R. namdaphaensis in 1985; however, they were not compared with R. rhodopus at that time, only with R. dulitensis.Sarkar & Sanyal (1985) In 1999, it was stated that R. rhodopus is a junior synonym of the frog that, after much renaming due to homonymy, had become known as R. bipunctatus. But the type specimens were not examined; it was simply stated that Lui and Hu had misread some old descriptions of R. bipunctatus and that, as frogs from Vietnam were quite obviously of the same species as those from Thailand - which were believed to be R. bipunctatus -, R. rhodopus was synonymized with R. bipunctatus. However, R. bipunctatus had in fact never been reported from so far to the southeast by any older author. In 2005, a similar moss frog from Myanmar was described as Htun Win's Treefrog (Rhacophorus htunwini).Wilkinson et al. (2005) The mystery was unravelled when the type specimens of R. bipunctatus and R. namdaphaensis were finally examined and compared with other specimens from southeastern Asia in 2007. It turned out that the frogs from the border region of India, China and Myanmar, originally described as R. bipunctatus, matched R. htunwini, but not the frogs described as R. rhodopus and R. namdaphaensis. So the actual situation seems to be that the three taxa refer to two, not three species, with R. htunwini being a junior synonym of R. bipunctatus - possibly a restricted-range endemic of upland forest at the eastern end of the Himalayas, though it might occur south to Malaysia -, and R. namdaphaensis a junior synonym of R. rhodopus, a species that ranges widely from eastern India to the east and south and also occurs in lower-lying regions. Thus, it seems that the 1999 study compared only specimens of R. rhodopus with other specimens of R. rhodopus, and therefore its conclusion that these constituted just one species was indeed correct. The mistake was rather the failure to compare even a single individual of the actual R. bipunctatus with the frogs from Thailand and Vietnam. Indeed, the authors of the 1999 study stated, > \\"[Liu and Hu] assumed that [R. bipunctatus] was green, possibly because > Boulenger (1882) reported that it resembled R. reinwardtii.\\"; but that it usually does have a green back was confirmed both by the description of R. htunwini and by examination of the lectotype specimen of R. bipunctatus. In fact, the separation of R. htunwini from R. rhodopus - then called R. bipunctatus - was partly due to that striking difference in dorsal coloration.

A late bloomer, he did not make the varsity team until his senior year.Lewiston Morning Tribune – Buratto has good chance to stick with Green Bay – 1966-08-18 – p.16 He attended junior college at Columbia Basin College for a year in Pasco, Washington, then transferred to the University of Idaho in Moscow, recruited by Bud Riley to play for head coach Dee Andros. He redshirted in 1962 and then was a center for the Vandals for three seasons, and played with Jerry Campbell and Don Matthews. Not selected in the 1966 NFL Draft, Buratto tried out with the Green Bay Packers, then taught at Sandpoint High School for a year, and was invited to try again with Green Bay in 1967.The (Regina) Leader-Post – Steve Buratto – 1980-09-05 – p.15 After losing due to an intestinal virus, Buratto arrived at camp weakened and underweight, so it was back to Idaho as a graduate assistant. In 1968, Buratto left for Twin Falls High School in southern Idaho, where he was an assistant football coach and the wrestling coach. In 1973, he joined the staff at Boise State under head coach Tony Knap, a fellow former Vandal. He followed Knap to UNLV in 1976 for four seasons, before he left for Saskatchewan of the CFL.Lewiston Morning Tribune Buratto wants UI job – 1978-01-05 – p.B1 CFL coach Buratto's pro coaching career started in 1980 as the Offensive Line Coach for the Saskatchewan Roughriders. In 1983, he became the Defensive Coordinator for the B.C. Lions, where his team lost to the Argonauts in the Grey Cup final. He was named Head Coach of the Calgary Stampeders in 1984. After a 6–10 record and last place finish in the West Division in 1984, followed by a poor start the following year, he was fired and replaced by Bud Riley. In 1986 he returned to B.C. as their Co-Offensive Coordinator/Defensive Coordinator. After a 7-year hiatus, he returned to coaching in 1993 as the Offensive Line Coach for the Saskatchewan Roughriders. He then helped build one of the greatest offences in league history as Offensive Coordinator of the Baltimore Stallions. In 1994 and 1995 the team made back-to-back Grey Cup appearances. In 2000 he became receivers coach for the Lions, however only held the job for a few weeks as he was promoted to head coach after head coach Greg Mohns resigned to join the XFL. Over the team's final 11 games he led the Lions to a 5–6 record, good enough for a spot in the playoffs. In the Division Semifinals B.C. upset the Edmonton Eskimos 34–32 at Commonwealth Stadium. In the Division Finals, the Lions traveled to McMahon Stadium where they defeated the 12–5 Calgary Stampeders 37–23. In the 88th Grey Cup, the Lions faced the 12–6 Montreal Alouettes. Despite being an underdog, the Lions held the lead throughout the game and won 28–26. The Lions, who finished with an 8–10 record during the regular season, became the first team ever to finish with a regular season record below .500 and win the Grey Cup. Buratto was retained by the Lions for the 2001 season, going 8–10 and losing to Calgary in the Division Semifinals. After a 1–5 start in 2002, Buratto was replaced by General Manager Adam Rita.

Unlike the other three major professional sports leagues in the U.S. (Major League Baseball, the NBA and the NHL), all regular-season and post-season games are shown on American television on one of five national networks. Most preseason games are still televised by regional/local broadcasters, with selected preseason games simulcast on national networks.  Background  All regular-season and postseason games are shown in the U.S. on one of five national networks: the broadcast networks of CBS, Fox, or NBC; or the cable channels ESPN or NFL Network. The league does not, in general, have an anti-siphoning rule for regular season games, and such games can be (and are) carried on both the cable outlet and the local affiliate. Since 2018, selected regular season games airing on NFL Network are also simulcast on Fox. For those regular season games aired exclusively on NFL Network or ESPN, they are also simulcast on a local broadcast station in each of the home markets of the two participating teams (determined by a bidding process). ESPN also airs one postseason game that is also simulcast on their sister national broadcast network ABC; all other postseason games air televised on either CBS, Fox, or NBC. As part of the Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961, the U.S government granted the NFL permission to sell the rights to all regular season and postseason games to the national networks, as an exemption to antitrust laws. Most preseason games, except a few contests such as the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game, are not televised by the national networks, and the league leaves television rights for those contests up to the individual teams. Most teams produce the games, either themselves or with help from the networks, and set up small syndication networks to carry games throughout the league-designated primary and secondary markets each team serves. The stations that win bidding to locally broadcast cable games are not necessarily the same as the ones who broadcast preseason contests, as the bidding processes are separate; this list is of the preseason broadcasters. In the event that a preseason game does not sell out, the local rightsholder must delay the broadcast a minimum of 24 hours (this rule, along with the rest of the league's blackout policies, was suspended for the 2015 season). NFL Network sometimes simulcasts select preseason games using the feeds of the local broadcast crews. In these cases, the NFL does impose an anti-siphoning rule and does not carry a live game in a particular market if a local station is broadcasting the same game. On radio, all 32 teams have regional/local syndication networks that carry all preseason, regular season and most postseason games; these are listed here. Radio syndication networks are mostly unrestricted and can be carried anywhere in North America, and several supplemental networks (Compass Media Networks, Sports USA Radio Network) also carry additional Sunday afternoon games outside the home teams' markets. The league's night games are carried both by local networks and by the NFL on Westwood One, a partnership that goes back several decades; the Super Bowl is exclusive to Westwood One, and local broadcasts of that game can only be carried on one flagship station in each team's market.  Regional broadcasters  The following is a list of local radio and preseason TV broadcasters for each individual team. Four teams, the Arizona Cardinals, the Baltimore Ravens, the Minnesota Vikings, and the New York Giants, do preseason television/radio simulcasts. Some teams like the New England Patriots and the San Francisco 49ers have their regular radio announcers instead call their preseason telecasts, and then have a different announcing team call their preseason radio broadcasts. For the preseason telecasts of many other teams, they may employ announcers who work for the national networks (either NFL or college football games) during the regular season. Several teams also offer Spanish language broadcasts to serve their Hispanic fan bases.  AFC   AFC East  {  - ! Team ! Play-by-play ! Analyst ! Sideline reporter ! Flagship station(s) !

The dorsum has a colour pattern characterized by prominent dark brown blotches. Ghatixalus variabilis build spherical foams nests that are suspended up to above the water. Tadpoles hatch within the foam and drop to the water after a few days. Illustration of Polypedates pleurostictus from Albert Günther's The Reptiles of British India where it was described as a new species in 1864. A study published in 2001 considered it to be synonym of Ghatixalus variabilis, although another study published the same year doubted this. At present, it is treated as a synonym of G. variabilis. Habitat and distribution Ghatixalus variabilis is only known from the Nilgiri hills (a part of the Western Ghats), Tamil Nadu, India. They are found in evergreen montane forest patches at high altitudes. They are only found very near mountain streams, either on ground or low in the vegetation. When disturbed they escape to the water. Their habitat is threatened by fragmentation due to agricultural and logging activities as well as rural and/or urban development.

It is endemic to Ryukyu Islands, Japan. It is known from Amamioshima, Kakeromajima, Ukejima, Yoronjima and Tokunoshima islands of the Amami Group, and Okinawajima, Iheyajima and Kumejima islands of the Okinawa Group. Two subspecies are distinguished: Okinawa green tree frog (Zhangixalus viridis viridis) of the Okinawa Group and Amami green tree frog (Zhangixalus viridis amamiensis) of the Amami Group. Zhangixalus viridis is no longer present on Yoronjima island. Its disappearance from the island some time after 1958 is attributed to habitat change (conversion of paddy fields to drier habitats) and an introduced predator, Japanese weasel (Mustela itatsi). This is the first island-level extinction of a native amphibian in the Ryukyu Archipelago during modern times. Zhangixalus viridis is a moderate-sized rhacophorid frog (snout-vent length ). It is a common species in forests close to paddy fields and wetlands. It breeds in wetlands and paddy fields by larval development.

Three T. corticale camouflaged on a rock face.  Description  The common name \\"mossy frog\\" arises from the fact that its skin is a mottled green and brown that resembles moss growing on rock, and forms an effective form of camouflage. They have large sticky pads on their toes and a soft underbelly. They measure about in snout–vent length. The females will grow larger than the males and can reach sizes of .

Mossy frog displaying camouflage adaptations  Habitat and conservation Its natural habitats are primarily evergreen rainforests and subtropical forest where they have been found inside pools in hollowed logs, placed by the local villagers. It is a semi-aquatic that is found in caves and steep rocky cliffs. Breeding takes place in rock cavities or tree holes. Its habitat is threatened by forest loss.

It is continued north of Houston Street as First Avenue. South of Division Street, it is known as Pike Street to its southern terminus at South Street. The northbound and southbound roadways are separated by a meridian mall, which has two bike lanes located outside the meridian mall; each bike lane is unidirectional. The street's namesake was Master Commandant William Henry Allen, the youngest person to command a Navy ship in the War of 1812. He was killed in action at the age of 28. His exploits included the capture of the British ship HMS Macedonian.  History  Looking north from Broome Street. George B. Luks, Allen Street, c.1905 Second Avenue El in the foreground Prior to 1799, this street in lower Manhattan was laid out and named \\"Chester Street\\". After the building of the New York Orphan Asylum on this street around May 1806 \\"Chester Street\\" was renamed \\"Asylum Street\\". In 1833, \\"Asylum Street\\" was quietly renamed Third Street, and finally \\"Allen Street.\\" During its heyday in the early part of the 20th century, it was populated by Romanian Jews, as well as Sephardic Jews from Turkey, Syria, Egypt and Greece. Many worked in brass and copper fabrication shops in the basements, while the wares were sold in street level stores. In September 1903, a gun battle was fought beneath the El tracks at Allen and Rivington Streets between followers of Paul Kelly, leader of the Five Points Gang, and the rival gang of Monk Eastman. At one point a hundred men joined the fray, with police driven off by gunfire. Three men were killed and numerous innocent civilians were injured. Fire destroyed an overcrowded tenement on Allen Street in March 1905, claiming the lives of twenty people. The five-story building at 105 Allen Street housed 200 people. The street was widened in the early 1930s by demolition of buildings on the east side of the street. This created a broad thoroughfare with a meridian mall in the center and the El running down the western roadway. The El was demolished in 1942. Allen Street was the site of numerous shops specializing in brassware in the 1910s through the 1940s but only two such shops remained by the late 1970s. In 1979, Allen Street was described by New York magazine as an \\"unbusy area removed from the bustle of Grand Street and the Bowery.\\" The street's center mall, along with that of Pike Street, was reconfigured in 2009. Parts of that mall were reconstructed completely in 2011.Allen and Pike StreetsAllen and Pike Streets: Before and After Streetsblog Transportation A portion of the elevated IRT Second Avenue Line, commonly known as the Second Avenue El, was constructed over Allen Street's current southbound roadway (then the entire street) from Houston Street to Division Street in 1878, blocking out most of the light from the then-narrow street. The elevated railway was taken down in 1942. Currently, the nearest subway stations are Grand Street station, three blocks west at Chrystie Street ( trains) and Delancey Street – Essex Street station, three blocks east at Essex Street ( trains). Also, at the corner of East Houston Street and Allen Street, there are multiple entrances to the Second Avenue station ( train). There is also an intercity bus station at 84-86 Allen Street. Allen Street is served in its entirety by the M15/M15 SBS bus routes. Part of Pike Street, down to Madison Street, is also serviced by the M15.

It is endemic to Myanmar and known from two widely separated localities: Thao, its type locality in the Karen Hills in south-central Myanmar where it was collected by Leonardo Fea in 1888, and the Tanintharyi Nature Reserve in southern Myanmar near the Thai border where it was collected in 2009–2010. Common name Burmese bug-eyed frog has been coined for it. Description The holotype, an adult female, measures in snout–vent length, whereas three adult males all measure about . The head is flat and triangular, shorter than it is wide. The tympanum is distinct and round. The fingers are long, with tips expanded into discs, and partially webbed (basal webbing between fingers I–II, increasing to nearly half-webbed between fingers III–IV). The toes are fully webbed and have discs that are slightly smaller than the finger discs. Dorsal skin is covered with calcified, white-tipped asperities, forming cluster especially near the tympana and along the dorsolateral region. Skin is cream colored and has brown blotches in the mid-dorsum. There is a dark brown bar between the eyes and a dark brown chevron between the shoulders. The flanks have cream-brown marbled pattern continuing onto the dorsum. Habitat and conservation Theloderma phrynoderma occurs in both lowland and montane wet evergreen forest as well as evergreen mixed deciduous and bamboo forest at elevations of above sea level. Reproductive behaviour is unknown, but presumably this species deposits its eggs in small bodies of standing water, such as water-filled tree holes or rock depressions. This species is known from few specimens, but it is not clear whether it is genuinely rare or simply difficult to detect. In general, its distribution area suffers from ongoing forest loss. The recently collected specimens are from a protected area (Tanintharyi Nature Reserve).

He was the editor of the FVdG's organ Einigkeit and—after World War I—owner of the publishing houses Fritz Kater Verlag and Syndikalist. The son of a farmhand, Kater was born in 1861 in Barleben. His mother died when he was two years old. From the age of five, he had to work on the farm or at home in order to support his family. During his final two years in school, he also worked in a local sugar factory during the winter. Even after Kater started an apprenticeship as a mason, he still had to help his father on the farm as the elderly man was frequently ill. Only during the winter did Kater have spare time to read and educate himself. Fritz Reuter, a humorous poet who wrote in Low German, was his favorite writer. Kater joined the mason's trade union in Magdeburg in 1883 at a time when the Anti-Socialist Laws forbade most union activities. He came into contact with socialists from Berlin and Hamburg soon becoming a socialist himself under their influence. Kater soon began spending much of his spare time reading illegal socialist literature, and became active in the union's clandestine activities. In 1887, Kater joined the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). In the same year he also founded a masons' union in Barleben, becoming the organization's first chairman. His unionist activities, which included trying to organize workers from the sugar factory he had worked in his youth, attracted resentment from the local authorities, especially from the head of the district authority, an extremely conservative Junker. In 1889 he was sentenced to a two-month prison term for holding an illegal meeting and in the following year he served even more time in jail for giving a speech held to be seditious. After the expiration of the Anti-Socialist Laws in 1890, Kater had close contacts with the opposition political movement Die Jungen, which was influenced by anarchist ideas. Kater was one of the founders of the Magdeburger Volksstimme, a social democratic newspaper started soon after the sunset of the Anti-Socialist Laws. The editors of the newspaper included several adherents of Die Jungen. At the 1891 Social Democratic Party (SPD) congress, Kater voted against the expelling Die Jungen movement from the party. Nevertheless, he remained in the party and did not join the new organization formed by Die Jungen, the Association of Independent Socialists. In 1892, Kater moved to Berlin. There he worked as a mason, was elected a delegate for the city masons' union, and became an agitator. During the debates over the organisational structure of the union, he supported the \\"localist\\" concept as well as the creation of the Representatives Centralization of Germany in 1897 (which renamed itself the FVdG in 1903). He became the first chairman of the federation's Business Commission. In 1907, after Kater refused a staff job with the centralized trade unions and declined to run as a delegate to the Reichstag delegate, he left the SPD. Though critical toward anarchism and syndicalism at first, Kater soon became a leading anarchosyndicalist figure in Germany. During a speech at the 1908 FVdG congress, Kater openly professed syndicalism for the first time. In 1913, he was a delegate at the First International Syndicalist Congress at Holborn Town Hall, London. Fritz Kater was instrumental in sustaining the FVdG's structures during World War I and was one of the founders of the Free Workers' Union of Germany (FAUD) after the war. He worked for the FAUD as a speaker and author, representing the trade union at various congresses of the International Workers Association. In 1930, he resigned as chairman of the FAUD because of his age. On May 8, 1945, Kater attempted to defuse a dud bazooka shell. The shell exploded, causing burns to his face and chest. Kater died twelve days later in the hospital. References * *Fritz Kater in Magdeburger Biographisches Lexikon. Retrieved July 24, 2007.

Occasionally, not continuously, the company also built trolleybuses. In 1935, it acquired the railway division of Officine Ferroviarie Meridionali and, soon afterwards, the aircraft division of the same company. In 1962, Breda was nationalised as part of EFIM, but was liquidated in the 1990s. The train and tram manufacturing division fused with Ansaldo to form AnsaldoBreda, the armaments division became an independent entity as Breda Meccanica Bresciana, as did the research division as Istituto Scientifico Breda.

Between 1936 and 1940, the company built a total of 28 trolleybuses, most for the Rome system but including six for Genoa. At various times between 1938 and 1956, more trolleybuses were built, but totalling only 16. Production resumed in 1988.

It is the follow-up to 1989's Elvira and the Party Monsters, also designed by Nordman. Description The game features a B-movie horror theme. Players have to go through the Six Tales Of Terror to level up the Stiff-o-meter. These are: Eyes Of The Bony Beast, Terror From The Crate, the Stiff In The Coffin, the Monster's Lab, Night Of The Leapers, and the Return Of The Deadheads. The interactive backbox contains a player controlled spinning spider. It is used to collect unique features and start special modes. Scared Stiff uses the DCS Sound System. Scared Stiff was exhibited at the 1996 AMOA show in Dallas, with Cassandra Peterson present in her Elvira identity to promote the game. When Scared Stiff was introduced in 1996, it was designed to have moving rubber boogieman figures mounted over the slingshots. These were designed to move forward with the kicker each time the ball hit the slingshot. The game's ROM also allowed for the boogiemen to 'dance' to the music during the Boogie Man Boogie mode by kicking with the music. Very late in production, this feature was removed because the figures' arms were thought to eventually break off. An opening between the feet of the slingshot plastics is still present on all production machines, as well as an entry in the game's manual about the feature. Additionally, the code in the machine's ROM supports the feature. Because of this, many hobbyists have added the boogiemen figure modifications to their machines. Digital version Scared Stiff was available as a licensed table of The Pinball Arcade for several platforms until June 30th 2018.

Plot summary The novel is set against the background of the Civil Rights Act conflict during the early Johnson Administration. At the beginning of the book, Paul Whipple, a black character from the earlier novel Too Many Cooks (1938), whose trust Wolfe had gained against a strong West Virginia atmosphere of prejudice, tells Wolfe that Wolfe has since become his hero, and that he has also achieved his dream, stated in the earlier novel, of becoming an anthropologist. He has come, however, to draw upon the favor he did Wolfe 26 years earlier, by asking Wolfe to prevent his son Dunbar Whipple from marrying a rich white girl, Susan Brooke, with whom he is apparently in love. While claiming that he is not opposed, in principle at least, to mixed-race couples, Paul Whipple thinks that sensible rich white girls do not fall in love with poor black men, even if the rich white girl is working for a black civil rights organization in New York, the Rights of Citizens Committee. Wolfe is loath to interfere in the matter, but agrees to at least learn what he can about the true motivations of the socialite girlfriend and why she would be interested in a Negro boyfriend, to settle the debt he owes Whipple. Before the real mystery story gets underway, Stout allows some give and take on the concept of racism being a two-way street: blacks preferring their own as much as whites. Archie arranges a meeting with Susan Brooke through his girlfriend, Lily Rowan, but is unable to form a conclusion as to her motives. Wolfe has him fly to Racine, Wisconsin, Susan's hometown, to do research on her background. He discovers little except for an incident where a man who wanted to marry her, Richard Ault, shot himself on her front porch after she turned him down. He is doing more research when Wolfe suddenly calls him back to New York: Susan Brooke has been brutally murdered in her Harlem apartment. Dunbar Whipple is the prime suspect in the murder, and Wolfe agrees to work on his behalf. Wolfe focuses his investigation on Dunbar and Susan's co-workers at the Rights of Citizens Committee, over the objections of Whipple's lawyer Harold Oster, who is also the ROCC's counsel. Those interviewed include the organization's founder Thomas Henchly, Susan's superior Cass Faison, Rae Kallmann and Maud Jordan, two white volunteers, and Beth Tiger, a black stenographer Archie takes immediate interest in. Susan's family is also interviewed, and it becomes apparent that they are bigots who consider her involvement with Civil Rights a \\"kink\\" and do not believe she could have been engaged to Dunbar. Her sister- in-law Dolly is particularly vitriolic and Archie takes an instant dislike to her. The family claims that Susan was actually engaged to a white car dealer named Peter Vaughn. Saul Panzer discovers that Dolly Brooke lied about her alibi the night of the murder by interviewing a garage attendant who saw her take her car out an hour before the murder took place. They cannot prove it because the witness refuses to testify, but stumble upon a lucky break when Vaughn, riddled with guilt, confesses to Archie that he lied to the police to firm up Dolly's alibi. Wolfe and Archie confront Mrs. Brooke, who admits that she went to Susan's apartment, but she could not get in because no one answered her knock. This indicates that Susan was already dead at 8:45, long before Dunbar Whipple arrived at the apartment. Her evidence clears him, but Wolfe elects not to use it because that would not only endanger Vaughn but would complicate matters by destroying the lead he has on the police. Several days later, Vaughn calls Archie, telling him that he may have more information but that he has to do some checking on it first. The next day he is found dead, shot multiple times. When it emerges that Vaughn went to the ROCC the day before for information on Susan and Dunbar, Wolfe brings the key players to his office for another interview to prevent their being arrested as material witnesses. It is during this interview that Wolfe realizes that the key to the case lies in the unusual frequency of a diphthong in the names of those involved. It will take another trip to the Midwest for Archie, this time to Evansville, Indiana, before the case is solved. The use of Paul Whipple as a character in a 1964 Nero Wolfe novel was problematic, since Rex Stout never allowed his recurring characters to age. Whipple was a young man in Too Many Cooks, but had aged 26 years and was a middle-aged academic in A Right to Die. In all this time, Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin miraculously remained the same age, but Whipple never noticed or mentioned this oddity. Civil rights As noted earlier, Rex Stout had already had Nero Wolfe make civil rights a central issue in his 1938 Wolfe novel Too Many Cooks, although in that case his client was a not a black man, and so while many books were being written in that time period about the civil rights of Black Americans, few mainstream authors were writing a civil-rights sequel to a novel from 1938. Reviews and commentary *Jacques Barzun and Wendell Hertig Taylor, A Catalogue of Crime — Archie bestirs himself in Louisville and Evansville on the trail of a murderer whose identity is suggested to Nero by the abnormal frequency of a certain diphthong.

Upon completion of his clerkship, he entered private practice in Salt Lake City, Utah with Jones, Waldo, Holbrook & McDonough. Six months into his job, he was arguing a 10-week anti-trust case, which resulted in a favorable jury verdict. Murphy stayed with the firm from 1973-85.

Pakistan's first Test match was played in Delhi in October 1952 as part of a five Test series which India won 2–1. Pakistan made their first tour of England in 1954 and drew the series 1–1 after a memorable victory at The Oval in which fast bowler Fazal Mahmood took 12 wickets. Pakistan's first home Test match was in Dacca in January 1955 against India, after which four more Test matches were played in Bahawalpur, Lahore, Peshawar and Karachi (all five matches in the series were drawn, the first such occurrence in test historyStump the Bearded Wonder No 126: BBC Sport Retrieved 28 February 2007.).

Player disputes and rebellions The Pakistan team has been marred by player disputes and rebellions within the team on various instances. The first such reported instance was in 1981, when ten players including Imran Khan, Asif Iqbal and Majid Khan refused to play under the captaincy of Javed Miandad.Players revolt under Javed Miandad Once again, in 1992 Miandad was the target of another revolt this time led by Wasim Akram with the support of now retired Imran Khan. This led to Miandad being replaced with Akram. Later in 1993, when Wasim Akram was appointed captain of the national team, players including Waqar Younis and Javed Miandad revolted against him and Akram was removed as captain. Akram did regain captaincy again in 1996 and then again in 1998–99. In 2009, many senior players revolted against captain Younis Khan when the team was playing in the UAE against New Zealand.

The statistic is defined as the total number of days the listing is on the active market before either an offer is accepted or the agreement between real estate broker and seller ends. Generally, properties with a large DOM value will command lower prices than properties with few DOM because a perception exists that the property may be overpriced or less desirable. DOM often factors into developing a pricing strategy. DOM can also be used as a \\"thermometer\\" to gauge the temperature of a housing market. The other use for this statistic is allowing prospective home sellers an idea of how long it may take to sell a property. The MLS is controlled by the real estate industry and has been the subject of many lawsuits. This value is not necessarily how long the house has been on the market due to intricacies within the multiple listing service (MLS) database. Depending on the rules of the MLS that is being used, the number is reset if a seller switches real estate agents. Sometimes there is also the arguably unethical practice of \\"withdrawing\\" the listing before it expires and adding the listing again to reset the DOM. As a result, when this statistic is used it is often lower than the true value. However, savvy real estate agents (if the MLS allows) will research the property's listing history and can tell more effectively how long the property has been on the market. DOMM Days on the Market- MLS (DOM-M or DOMM) is the number of days this exact Multiple Listing Service (MLS) listing has been on the market. DOMP Days on the Market- Property (DOM-P or DOMP) is the number of days the property has been for sale regardless of the number of different Realtors. Housing bubble Prior to the historic housing bubble that formed in or around 2001 due to loose credit and irrational exuberance, the term DOMP was practically a mystery to anyone other than real estate industry insiders. When the Housing Bubble began to rapidly deflate in late 2005, the inventory of homes for sale exploded, which caused both sales and prices to fall well below levels predicted by leading economists. These economists were frequently separated into varying levels of respect depending on their affiliation with the REIC, because the National Association of Realtors (NAR) economists were caught giving incorrect predictions about the state of the housing market despite what was actually happening in many U.S cities. Manipulating DOMP To prop up rapidly falling sales, real estate agents across the country began to rely on the process of manipulating the amount of time that homes had been on the market more than ever to attract buyers and maintain sales prices. There were great disparities concerning the practice in the various regional MLS's across the country. Some MLS's charged real estate agents to alter the statistics, and referred to the practice as \\"refreshing a listing.\\" In general however, the old guard of the real estate industry considered the practice as deceptive at best, and fraudulent at worst. Rumors of possible lawsuits circulated in the industry because homes that had been on the market for long periods of time were considered to be overpriced and thus not worth their advertised sales prices. The practice also stood in dark contrast to the National Association of Realtor's Code of Ethics that prohibits doing anything that is deceptive to buyers.realtor.org Sometimes a property might be 83 days with one Realtor, and then 10 days with another. That would show up as: DOMP/DOMM= 93/10. Some realtors will try to fudge this data to make a listing look brand new.

It is a member of the Fair Youth sequence, in which the poet expresses his love towards a young man. Synopsis The sonnet continues the themes of the breakdown of the relationship between the youth and the poet. The poet suggests that the youth should reject him now that everyone seems to be against him. The poet exhorts the youth not to wait to reject him until after these other, less important, sorrows have passed. At least if he is rejected now, his other problems will pale into insignificance. Structure Sonnet 90 is an English or Shakespearean sonnet. The English sonnet has three quatrains, followed by a final rhyming couplet. It follows the typical rhyme scheme of the form, ABAB CDCD EFEF GG, and is composed in iambic pentameter, a type of poetic metre based on five pairs of metrically weak/strong syllabic positions. The 10th line exemplifies a regular iambic pentameter: × / × / × / × / × / When other petty griefs have done their spite, (90.10) Lines 5 and 7 have a final extrametrical syllable or feminine ending. Line 7 may also be read as exhibiting another common metrical variation, the initial reversal: / × × / × / × / × / (×) Give not a windy night a rainy morrow, (90.7) :/ = ictus, a metrically strong syllabic position. × = nonictus. (×) = extrametrical syllable. Initial reversals also occur in lines 3 and 6, and potentially 2. A potential mid-line reversal occurs in line 11 (\\"so shall\\").

Chaibancha died while filming the stunt for the final scene in the film.Tupchai, Suchada (2005) Adoring fans remember famous Thai film star Mitr Chiabancha, Pattaya Mail. Retrieved 2007-07-24.Insee tong, DVD, 2005, no ISBN number, publisher name is in Thai script. Plot Rom Ritthikrai (Mitr Chaibancha) is at a nightclub getting very drunk and trying to persuade others to join him in his fun. He is retrieved by his faithful assistant Oy (Petchara Chaowarat). Rom is actually the masked crimefighter, Insee Daeng, or Red Eagle, and he uses the persona as a fun-loving drunkard as a cover. However, an impostor Insee Daeng (Kanchit Kwanpracha) is committing murders, so Rom must change his masked alias to another color, and he becomes the Golden Eagle, or Insee Tong. The impostor Red Eagle is connected to the Red Bamboo gang, which is trying to seize control of the Thai government. Red Bamboo is led by Bakin (Ob Boontid), who was trained in hypnotism by Rasputin and is able to kill his intended targets by beaming his thoughts and visage through red ceramic Buddha statues, which are being delivered to various Thai officials. Bakin can also split himself into three images, making it impossible for gunmen to shoot him. Disguised as Golden Eagle, Rom sneaks into the Red Bamboo gang's house and discovers that the daughter of an admiral is being held hostage. A police detective, meanwhile, is investigating his own angle on the case, going undercover as a transvestite to infiltrate a ring of transvestite criminals who are in league with the Red Bamboo gang. A case of mistaken identities causes the policeman and Golden Eagle to get into a fight. The plot comes to a climax on an island in the Gulf of Thailand, with the police racing in on boats to attack a Red Bamboo stronghold. The mission accomplished, the Golden Eagle takes hold of a rope ladder on a helicopter and is carried aloft and into the sunset, in true action hero style. Remake In 2010, a remake of this film named The Red Eagle was directed by Wisit Sasanatieng. Production and Mitr's death Insee Thong was the first film that Mitr produced himself, and it featured the return of his popular character, the masked crime-fighter, Insee Daeng (Red Eagle), the secret alter ego of detective Rom Rittikrai. On the last day of shooting, the script called for Mitr to fly off into the sunset in a helicopter. As the camera rolled, Mitr leapt from the ground to grab the rope ladder hanging from the aircraft. The helicopter flew higher and higher and Mitr lost his grip and fell to the ground. The accident was all caught on film and was actually left in the final theatrical release. The fatal drop has since been removed from DVD versions of the film, with Mitr simply flying off into the distance, and some text onscreen, paying tribute to the star. Mitr's death was ruled as an accident. For safety, there should have been two takes for that final scene. The first would be of Mitr grabbing the ladder and flying off at low altitude. Then, a stunt double would have performed the second shot at higher altitude. DVD release Insee tong was released on DVD in Thailand in 2005. The English-subtitled DVD contains a music video, photo gallery and footage from the cremation ceremony of Mitr Chaibancha.

Its inhabitants are the descendants of human space voyagers who crash-landed on Windhaven centuries before the events of the book take place. After the crash, the survivors spread out and settled on the many scattered islands of Windhaven's waterworld. In order to preserve tenuous lines of communication across the vast seas, the stranded population constructed mechanically simple gliding rigs from available spaceship wreckage; the gliders could be kept aloft almost indefinitely in Windhaven's stormy atmosphere by their pilots. After centuries of using this practice as the principal means of maintaining social contact among the islands, Windhaven's flyers have developed into a caste superior to the landsmen. Additionally, the flyer caste maintains ownership of the flying rigs — commonly known as \\"wings\\" — by keeping them within flyer families, so none of Windhaven's landsmen can aspire to ever wear them. These caste-based differences serve as the impetus for the novel's character-driven narrative. Prologue Maris is a young peasant girl who lives with her mother on the remote island Lesser Amberly. Her father, a fisherman, was killed an unspecified number of years before and Maris hardly remembers him. Though Maris and her mother survive mostly as scavenging \\"clam-diggers\\", they also collect refuse that washes onto the nearby beaches after violent coastal storms. Early one morning, Maris and her mother rise from bed and scour the beaches near their hovel for valuables after a particularly brutal tempest. Maris's search is largely fruitless and she recovers little. Afterward, however, she has a pivotal encounter with one of Windhaven's resident flyers. Lesser Amberly itself is home to three flyers, one of whom, an adult male named Russ, lands on the shore near where Maris has concluded her search. Maris timidly approaches Russ and, during the chance meeting, he treats her with kindness and she, in turn, reveals to him that her most ardent wish is to become one of Windhaven's flyers. Part 1: Storms Maris, now a young adult, has been adopted by Russ who, because of a serious injury, was forced to give up his life as a flyer. Customarily, flyer-wings pass to the oldest child of an established flyer. At the time of Russ's injury, however, Russ and his wife had no children. So Russ, in response to Maris's enthusiasm, trained her and then granted her the right to wear his wings. Since then, Maris has been acting as one of Lesser Amberly's three resident flyers by ferrying messages between Windhaven's far-flung colonies across the oceans. But, shortly after Maris was entrusted with the wings, Russ's wife gave birth to a son, Coll. Coll has just turned 13, and it is traditional that at 13, young flyers \\"come of age\\" and replace their parents as the ceremonial owners of the family wings. In this case, Coll is set to take Russ's wings back from Maris, as her claim to them is unlawful. However, Maris strongly desires to keep the wings for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that Coll has failed to prove that he is, or ever will become, a competent flyer. Additionally, unbeknownst to Russ, it is actually Coll's dream to become a traveling singer. Things are further complicated because Maris loves Coll both as a sister and as a mother — the latter being a role she gradually took on after Russ's wife died in giving birth to Coll. Maris, knowing that her desire to keep the wings is unrecognized by the ancient \\"flyer code,\\" ultimately wants Coll to fulfill his dream of becoming a singer. On the day Coll is to officially take the wings, he commits a grievous piloting error and lands badly in front of Maris, Russ and many of the important citizens of Lesser Amberly. Coll then refuses to take over stewardship of the wings, and he reveals to Russ that he will pursue a life as a singer and musician. Russ responds by angrily disowning both Maris and Coll, and the wings are confiscated by one of Lesser Amberly's other flyers, Corm. Corm soon lets it be known that he intends to give the wings to a flyer from a neighboring village, as he maintains that Maris never had a claim on the wings to begin with. Maris decides she must act quickly if she is to have any chance to get the wings back. In the night, she steals the wings from Corm and flies to another island. There she hands the wings over to the flyer Dorrel. Maris intends to have Dorrel call a \\"flyer's council\\" — a rare meeting of nearly all of Windhaven's flyers — in order to prove that she deserves the right to wear the wings. However, a flyer arrives and notifies Dorrel that Corm has already called for a council to be held. Soon after, at the council, Corm argues that Maris should be declared an outlaw and exiled. But Maris responds to Corm's attacks skillfully, convincing the other flyers that the family-based system of wing inheritance is unfair and archaic. The council then votes in favor of measures allowing for the creation of flyer academies, where any of Windhaven's citizens may learn to fly, and an annual flying competition, during which aspiring flyers will be allowed to compete for a chance to win their own wings from flyers. The council also grants Maris's request to keep Russ's wings. Part 2: One-Wing Several years later, Maris attempts to help persons without flyer lineage, or \\"one-wings,\\" train for the chance to compete for their own wings. Maris's loyalties to old friends often make her choices difficult, but she remains determined to push for more change and a fair chance for one-wings in Windhaven's society. As a result, she spends most of her spare time at Woodwings, the first flyer academy built, after the historic council decision. Early on, Maris learns that the last of the other flyer academies has been closed because of a tragic accident. She is also told that one of its students is journeying to Woodwings in order to continue training. When Maris meets the student, Val, she realizes that he is the original \\"one-wing,\\" a now-infamous peasant man who won a set of wings away from one of Maris's oldest friends, a female flyer who belonged to a venerated flyer family, in one of the first yearly competitions. However, at the time the competition was held, the flyer Val challenged was still mourning the recent death of her brother. Val's challenge was thereby regarded by the flyer community as being both dishonorable and despicable. Tragically, the defeated flyer killed herself after losing her wings to Val. Though Val lost the wings after being beaten by another flyer at the following year's competition, he quickly proves his competence at Woodwings and becomes close friends with one of the most promising students, a southern-born female one- wing named S'Rella. Val and S'Rella, along with four other students of lesser skill, will fly in the coming flyer's competition. Assisting the students in the competition amongst her old friends forces Maris to face her previously unnoticed preconceptions, loyalties and double-standards in flyer society. After successfully beating a competent flyer-born in the first two trials, Val is seriously beaten and injured on the last day, preventing him from competing. Maris, who has come to respect Val, and the rights of any flyer to compete with another, flies proxy in his place and wins his wings from Corm. S'Rella also wins her own wings against Maris' long-time friend Garth, whose health was failing. Part 3: The Fall Now an older woman, Maris attempts to fly in a storm and has a nearly fatal fall on the Island of Theos. She awakes in the home of the local healer, Evan, and over the course of a few months impatiently awaits the recovery of her legs and left arm. She can finally walk again but learns that her head injury will prevent her from flying, and her wings are taken away from her and given to her home island. In her grief, she attempts to distance herself from other flyers and the burgeoning one-wing culture. She denies her previous flyer identity and attempts to immerse herself in the work of physician's assistant for Evan, now her romantic partner. Maris' brother, Coll, and his young daughter arrive and stay with them for awhile, a theme in this chapter explores the depths of relationship that Maris has never experienced as a flyer who never grew roots in any community, life as a \\"land-bound.\\" However, Maris is urged to return to the center of the flyer world as an intermediary between the one-wings and flyer-born when a one-wing flyer, imprisoned by the powerful island landowner, is hanged for a controversial crime. Maris blames herself for failing to lend her aid to avoid the execution of this flyer, and so uses her new community ties to scheme with the flyers. They create a growing circle of one-wing flyers dressed in black circling the sky over the site of the execution in mourning and protest. She employs the power of the singers to tell the story of the wrongful execution and to paint the lands-man as a villain. She successfully gains cooperation between the one-wings and the flyer-born factions to come together as flyers and resolve the conflict peacefully, forcing the harsh and greedy lands-man out of power. Maris learns to balance her identity and community and chooses to stay with Evan instead of returning to teach young flyers at the academy, and likewise Evan surprises her by choosing to face his fears of leaving his only home to go with her so she could be where she was truly needed. Epilogue A dying Maris receives a singer at her bedside. She recites to the singer the words of a song written by her brother, Coll, who had died some years before. The song is Coll's last testament to Maris.

It is a member of the Fair Youth sequence, in which the poet expresses his love towards a young man. Synopsis The youth's dissolute behaviour is making corruption seem beautiful. Even descriptions of the youth's behaviour make it beautiful. The youth's beauty covers the blots of vice, but everything eventually loses its qualities if it is misused. Structure Sonnet 95 is an English or Shakespearean sonnet. The English sonnet has three quatrains, followed by a final rhyming couplet. It follows the typical rhyme scheme of the form, ABAB CDCD EFEF GG, and is composed in iambic pentameter, a type of poetic metre based on five pairs of metrically weak/strong syllabic positions. The 11th line exemplifies a regular iambic pentameter: × / × / × / × / × / Where beauty's veil doth cover every blot (95.11) :/ = ictus, a metrically strong syllabic position. × = nonictus. The 8th line has both an initial and a mid-line reversal: / × × / / × × / × / Naming thy name blesses an ill report. (95.8) Initial reversals are also present in lines 6 and 10, and potentially in lines 2, 4, and 9. The meter demands line 6's \\"lascivious\\" to function as three syllables.

His work with James Bradley attempting to measure stellar parallax led to the discovery of the aberration of light. The aberration was the first definite evidence that the earth moved and that Copernicus and Kepler were correct.Science and Its Times via In addition to his astronomical works, Molyneux wrote about the natural history and other features of Ireland. He died in suspicious circumstances. Early life Molyneux was born in Chester, England in 1689 and was the second son of William Molyneux, who was known for his work related to optics. His mother was Lucy Domville, daughter of Sir William Domville, the Attorney General for Ireland. Molyneux studied at Trinity College, Dublin, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts (BA) in 1708 and a Master of Arts (MA) in 1710. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1712.  Astronomical work  Molyneux is best known for his work with Bradley in attempting to measure the parallax of Gamma Draconis leading to the discovery of the aberration of light. Molyneux was interested in detecting parallax that others such as Robert Hooke had attempted but failed to detect. Unlike Hooke, Molyneux had large amounts of patience and had resources to expend. Like Hooke, Molyneux decided to take advantage of Gamma Draconis always being over London. Molyneux commissioned a larger set of telescopes and employed James Bradley as an expert who had more astronomical and mathematical knowledge. Working together, Bradley and Molyneux performed over 80 observations to a precision of greater than 1 arcsecond from December 1725 until late in 1727. Measurements of this precision had never before been performed with telescopes. Bradley and Molyneux were surprised to find that rather than detect a parallax they detected an unexplained wobble of the star. Moreover, similar wobbles were found by Bradley using another high-precision telescope for some 200 other stars. Molyneux died shortly before Bradley realized that the observed changes they were seeing was in fact due to the aberration of light.  Political career  Molyneux was Member of Parliament (MP) for Bossiney in Cornwall from 1715 to 1722, for St Mawes from 1726 to 1727, and for Exeter from 1727 to 1728. He served as Secretary to the Prince of Wales from 1715 to 1727 and as Lord of the Admiralty from 1727 to 1728. Between 1727 and 1728 he represented Dublin University in the Irish House of Commons. Death and legacy Molyneux married Lady Elizabeth Capel, daughter of Algernon Capell, 2nd Earl of Essex, on 5 April 1717. In 1728, he suffered a fit while in the House of Commons. He was treated by court anatomist Nathaniel St André, but the treatment did not prove successful, and Molyneux died in Kew in April. On the night of the death, St André eloped with Molyneux's wife, Elizabeth, the two marrying in 1730. Samuel Madden, a relative of Molyneux's, claimed that St André had poisoned the MP. Although St André won an action for defamation, he found himself unable to secure regular work.

It is reported that there are only 1–3 new cases of aortitis per year per million people in the United States and Europe. Aortitis is most common in people 10 to 40 years of age. Causes This inflammation has a number of possible causes, including trauma, viral or bacterial infections (notably, syphilis), and certain immune disorders and connective tissue diseases. Aortitis is most commonly seen in patients with syphilis, autoimmune vasculitis (giant cell arteritis, Takayasu's arteritis), polymyalgia rheumatica, and rheumatoid arthritis.[Taber's Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary. 19th ed. Philadelphia: F.A. Davis, 2001.] IgG4-related disease has more recently been identified as a cause of aortitis, and also as a cause of periaortitis (inflammation surrounding the aorta). There is a wide range of symptoms that are dependent on the location of the aortic inflammation or associated disorder. A few symptoms recognized in patients are fever, chills, muscle pains, and malaise (general discomfort). In addition, hypertension (high blood pressure) may occur. Hypertension happens when the renal artery narrows and elasticity of the aorta and branches decrease.Link text, American Heart Association. Aortitis can also be caused by Salmonella infection. Diagnosis Treatment Treatment of aortitis depends on the underlying cause. Infectious causes commonly require antibiotic treatment, while those associated with autoimmune vasculitides are generally treated with steroids. Management includes the following treatment priorities: stop the inflammation, treat complications, prevent and monitor for re-occurrence. Prognosis If untreated, has three distinct phases. The first is a prepulseless inflammatory stage with nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue, arthralgias, and low-grade fevers. Phase two includes vascular inflammation with pain secondary to the condition, along with tenderness to palpation over the site. The last phase includes symptoms of ischemia and pain associated with the use of limbs. Limbs are also cool and clammy in this stage.

Kikaku is best known for his haiku, such as the one in this anecdote about him and his master: One day, Kikaku composed a haiku, :Red dragonfly / break off its wings / Sour cherry which Bashō changed to, :Sour cherry / add wings to it / Red dragonfly; thus saying that poetry should add life to life, not take life away from life.MBR: Reviewer's Bookwatch, October 2001The Conversation Continues - Page 28 His master is known to have denigrated Kikaku's 'flippant efforts'. Kikaku wrote of coarser subjects than Bashō, and in this respect his poetry was closer to earlier haikai. Kikaku set the tone for haikai from Bashō's death until the time of Yosa Buson in the late 18th century.

A member of the 1960s student left, he dropped out of the university in 1971 to work as an alternative journalist without completing his degree. In the mid-1970s, he went on to co-edit a series of books on student activism for the National Student Association and National Student Educational Fund. He also became an active shop steward with the National Lawyers' Guild. During the late 1970s, he became the Washington, D.C., bureau chief of High Times magazine, and in 1979, he helped to organize citizens' hearings on FBI surveillance practices. From then until 1982, he worked as a paralegal investigator at the Better Government Association in Chicago, conducting research for an American Civil Liberties Union case, involving police surveillance by the Chicago police (which became known as the \\"Chicago Red Squad\\" case). He also worked on cases filed against the FBI or police on behalf of the Spanish Action Committee of Chicago (S.A.C.C.), the National Lawyers Guild, the American Indian Movement, Socialist Workers Party, the Christic Institute, and the American Friends Service Committee (a Quaker group). He was a founder member of the Chicago Area Friends of Albania, leaving the organization when he relocated to Boston in 1987. Berlet along with journalist Russ Bellant, has written about Lyndon LaRouche's National Caucus of Labor Committees, calling it anti-Jewish and neo-Nazi, and urging an investigation of alleged illegal activities.LaRouche Cult Continues to Grow By Russ Bellant, Chip Berlet, & Dennis King, Political Research Associates, December 16, 1981 In 1982, Berlet joined Political Research Associates, and in 1985, he founded the Public Eye BBS, the first computer bulletin board aimed at challenging the spread of white-supremacist and neo-Nazi material through electronic media, and the first to provide an online application kit for requesting information under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act. He was one of the first researchers to have drawn attention to the efforts by white supremacist and antisemitic groups to recruit farmers in the Midwestern United States in the 1970s and 1980s. Berlet was originally on the board of advisers of Public Information Research, founded by Daniel Brandt. Between 1990 and 1992, three members of Brandt's PIR advisory board, including Berlet, resigned over issues concerning another board member, L. Fletcher Prouty and Prouty's book The Secret Team. Berlet discussed this in a study titled \\"Right-Woos Left.\\"Chip Berlet, \\"Right Woos Left: Populist Party, LaRouchite, and Other Neo-fascist Overtures To Progressives, And Why They Must Be Rejected,\\" Cambridge, Massachusetts: Political Research Associates, 1991. In 1996, he acted as an adviser on the Public Broadcasting Service documentary mini-series With God on Our Side: The Rise of the Religious Right in America, which was later published as a book by William Martin. Berlet criticized Ralph Nader and his associates for a close working relationship with Republican textile magnate Roger Milliken, erstwhile major backer of the 1996 presidential campaign of Pat Buchanan, and anti-unionization stalwart.Right-Wing Populism in America by Chip Berlet, pp. 338–344 Berlet has provided research assistance to a campaign run by the mother of Jeremiah Duggan to reopen the investigation into his death. The British student died in disputed circumstances near Wiesbaden, Germany.  Photojournalism  Berlet is also a photojournalist. His photographs, particularly of Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazi rallies, have been carried on the Associated Press wire, have appeared on book and magazine covers, album covers and posters, and have been published in The Denver Post, The Washington Star, and The Chronicle of Higher Education,  Reception  The most recent of Berlet's two books, co-authored with Matthew N. Lyons, is Right-Wing Populism in America: Too Close for Comfort, published in 2000 by The Guilford Press. It is a broad historical overview of right-wing populism in the United States. The book received generally favorable reviews. Library Journal said it was a \\"detailed historical examination\\" that \\"strikes an excellent balance between narrative and theory.\\" The New York Review of Books described it as an excellent account describing the outermost fringes of American conservatism. Reprinted as Chapter 9 in A review by Jerome Himmelstein in the journal Contemporary Sociology said that \\"it offers more than a scholarly treatise on the activities of the Third Reich\\", that it provides a background to help the reader understand the Holocaust and that it \\"merits close attention from scholars of the political right in America and of social movements generally.\\" Himmelstein, Jerome L., Review of book Right-Wing Populism in America: Too Close for Comfort, Contemporary Sociology, Vol. 31, No. 1 (Jan., 2002), pp. 76–77, American Sociological Association Robert H.

It is a member of the Fair Youth sequence. Synopsis The young man is praised for the charms found in both his faults and his good qualities; if he wanted to he could \\"lead away\\" or seduce even more of those who gaze at him. In the final couplet the speaker urges him: Do not, because since the young man's good reputation is in part based on his faults, if he goes too far those faults could be a danger to both of their reputations. The final couplet is identical to the final couplet of sonnet 36. Each couplet however has a different meaning according to the context of each sonnet.Shakespeare, William. Duncan-Jones, Katherine. Shakespeare’s Sonnets. Bloomsbury Arden 2010. p. 302 . Structure Sonnet 96 is an English or Shakespearean sonnet, which is composed of three quatrains, and a final rhyming couplet. The poem's lines follow the rhyme scheme ABAB CDCD EFEF GG, and are written in iambic pentameter: Five feet, each with two syllables accented weak/strong. The 3rd line is an example of a regular iambic pentameter: × / × / × / × / × / Both grace and faults are lov'd of more and less: (96.3) :/ = ictus, a metrically strong syllabic position. × = nonictus. The 9th line presents a case of metrical ambiguity. Probably the simplest scansion features only one metrical variation, a reversal of the accents in the third foot: × / × / / × × / × / How many lambs might the stern wolf betray, (96.9) However, the line may be read differently, depending upon the reader's interpretation. The line may be scanned with an initial reversal, and with the rightward movement of the third ictus (resulting in a four-position figure, \`× × / /\`, sometimes referred to as a minor ionic): / × × / × × / / × / How many lambs might the stern wolf betray, (96.9) The meter calls for a few variant pronunciations: line 5's \\"thronèd\\" is two syllables, and line 14's \\"being\\" is one. In lines 8 and 10 \\"translated\\" and \\"translate\\" are both stressed on the second syllable.

Grussendorf represented Sitka, Alaska (where he lived for most of his life) and surrounding areas for ten terms in the Alaska House of Representatives, and remains one of the body's longest-serving members. He also served as Speaker of the House, becoming the first person to be elected to that office for three terms. Early life Benjamin Franklin Grussendorf, Jr. was born in Grand Rapids, Minnesota to Fern (née Ross) and Benjamin Franklin Grussendorf. He grew up there, where his father was a judge. He received a M.A. degree from the University of Minnesota. He moved to Sitka, Alaska in 1966, where he worked as a teacher at Sitka High School and instructor in political science at Sitka Community College. Political career Local politics in Sitka Grussendorf entered politics when he served on Sitka's charter commission in 1971, responsible for merging the City of Sitka and the Greater Sitka Borough into today's City and Borough of Sitka. From there, he served on the new municipality's Assembly and was deputy vice mayor. He was mayor of Sitka from 1975 to 1979, also serving as president of the Alaska Conference of Mayors. State legislature Grussendorf originally ran for the Alaska House in 1972, unsuccessfully challenging appointed incumbent Edward Flynn in the primary election. Howard C. Bradshaw, Sitka's senator since statehood, resigned in late 1971 to become the director of the Sitka Pioneer Home. Sitka's representative, H. D. \\"Pete\\" Meland, was appointed to replace Bradshaw, with Flynn appointed to replace Meland. Flynn would lose in the general election to Republican nominee Richard Irving \\"Dick\\" Eliason, a former Sitka mayor who was originally elected to the seat in 1968 by 54 votes over Democratic incumbent Frank Getman, before losing reelection to Meland in 1970 by 22 votes. Grussendorf again ran for the House in 1980, this time for an open seat, as Meland retired and Eliason ran for his Senate seat. Grussendorf would serve ten terms in the House, from 1981 to 2001. Grussendorf served three terms as Speaker of the House, 1985–1986, 1987–1988 and 1991–1992. He was the only person to serve three terms as speaker until 2013, when Mike Chenault was elected to a third term at the start of the 28th Alaska State Legislature. During his last term as speaker, Eliason finished up his legislative career by serving as Senate president prior to retiring. This marked the only time in the state's history that the legislature's two respective presiding officers hailed from the same community. Personal and later life Grussendorf was married to Karen (née Solem) and they had two children, son Tim and daughter Karla. Tim Grussendorf was a longtime Senate aide, mostly during his father's tenure in office (the legislature's nepotism policy allow family members of legislators to work or seek employment in the opposite chamber). He has been a candidate for office himself, but without the success of his father. Grussendorf was a Presbyterian. He died on June 17, 2011 after a lengthy illness.

Crofts' brother, Ernest Crofts, was a rather successful painter. In fact, at circa 1888 one of Ernest Crofts' paintings titled \\"Marston Moor\\" had been exhibited at the Royal Academy of Art in London; it is speculated that the Ernest Crofts painting of the battle scene is what may have truly inspired Donisthorpe and W.C. Crofts to revamp their desires to create the first motion picture.Industry, Liberty, and a Vision: Wordsworth Donisthorpe's Kinesigraph; Stephen Herbert; Mo Heard; London; Projection Box; 1998 Since Crofts and Donisthorpe were staunch laissez faire supporters they were constantly at odds with the ever-rising socialist movement in England. Especially considering the political group Donisthrope and Crofts helped to found, they were always in political battles with the many socialist groups that were emerging all around them. In 1890, the riots at Trafalgar Square were fueled with socialist contempt over the government and their nemesis corporate England. Crofts and Donisthorpe wished to make their first recording on their newly patented \\"Kinesigraph\\" at that very square; the contents of the imaging is notably short but forever prolific. Considering Crofts and Donisthorpe's political positions and passions, it's reasonable to believe that they both were motivated to bring motion pictures to the world for if not entertainment value than most certainly for educational and political purposes. During Crofts and Donisthorpe's days with the \\"Liberty and Property Defense league\\" they had certainly used images from their latest photographic inventions to help illustrate political points and images at these league meetings.Industry, Liberty, and a Vision: Wordsworth Donisthorpe's Kinesigraph; Stephen Herbert; Mo Heard; London; Projection Box; 1998 References External links * Category:1846 births Category:1894 deaths Category:English lawyers Category:English businesspeople Category:19th-century English architects Category:Photographers from Yorkshire Category:Architects from Bradford Category:19th-century English photographers ","title":"William Carr Crofts"},{"id":"12413478","text":"Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen is the fifth album by the country rock band Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen.

It is the fourth of five bridges which cross the railway lines and sidings located just west of Johannesburg Park Station, the first being the Johan Rissik Bridge adjacent to the station. It was completed in 2003, and cost R38 million to build.http://www.joburg.org.za/index.php?option=com_content&do;_pdf=1&id;=315&limitstart;=2http://www.roadtraffic- technology.com/projects/nelsonmandelabridge/ The proposal for the bridge was to link up two main business areas of Braamfontein and Newtown as well as to rejuvenate and to a certain level modernise the inner city. The bridge forms part of the M27 Route of Johannesburg. History A bridge linking Braamfontein to the Johannesburg city centre was first mooted by Steve Thorne and Gordon Gibson, urban designers, in 1993 in their urban design study of the Inner City of Johannesburg. In their study they named the bridge the Nelson Mandela bridge in recognition of the role Nelson Mandela was having in uniting South African society, and the symbolism of linkage and unity provided by the bridge. Structural design The bridge was constructed over 42 railway lines without disturbing railway traffic and is 284 metres long. There are two pylons, North and South, 42 and 27 metres high respectively. Engineers tried to keep the bridge as light as possible and used a structural steel with a concrete composite deck to keep weight down. Heavier banks along the bridge were reinforced by heavier back spans. The bridge consists of two lanes and has pedestrian walk-ways on either side. The bridge can be viewed from one of Johannesburg's most popular roads, the M1 highway.

Due to wear and tear, some underlying pages are seen in upper right corner. Lühhike öppetus (Estonian for Brief Instruction), by modern orthography 'Lühike õpetus', was the first periodical publication in the Estonian language. Edited by Dr. Peter Ernst Wilde and printed for a short while in 1766–1767, it described various simple medical techniques intended to be usable in the field by peasants. The full title of the newspaper was Lühhike öppetus mis sees moned head rohhud täeda antakse, ni hästi innimeste kui ka veiste haigusse ning viggaduste vasto, and it can be translated as Brief instruction announcing some good medicine, both for human and bovine ailments and traumas. It was printed weekly, with each issue having four pages. A total of 41 issues were printed. August Wilhelm Hupel was responsible for translating the content to Estonian language.  Classification  Lühhike öppetus did not deal with news; thus, it is not universally classified as a newspaper — despite its format. Various sources refer to it as a magazine, a journal, or even a book published in 41 volumes.

This diurnal species is endemic to southeastern Brazil where found among leaf litter on the floor of Atlantic rainforests at an altitude of . It is found in Espírito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, southeastern São Paulo and southeastern Minas Gerais. Although its type specimen supposedly was collected in Bahia about 200 years ago, there are no confirmed localities in this state and recent reviews consider it more likely that it was from Rio de Janeiro. B. ephippium is locally common, quite widespread compared to most other species of Brachycephalus and it is not considered threatened. B. ephippium feeds on tiny invertebrates and breeding is by direct development, with the female laying a few eggs on land that hatch into young toadlets (no tadpole stage). Appearance and toxicity An adult and two young under normal light (left) and UV light (right), showing that fluorescence varies with age B. ephippium is a very small frog with a snout–to–vent length of in adults, but it is among the largest in its genus together with species like B. darkside, B. garbeanus and B. margaritatus. Females tend to be larger than males. When newly hatched B. ephippium typically measure just . B. ephippium is overall bright yellow- orange and this is considered aposematic (warning colours) since its skin and organs contain tetrodotoxin and similar toxins. Newly hatched B. ephippium are well-camouflaged and brown overall. 11-oxoTTX (11-oxotetrodotoxin), an isolated analogue is extremely rare to be found in other animals, even marine animals, this analogue is considered four to five times more potent than the tetrodotoxin itself. In 2019, scientists discovered that the head and back of this toadlet and the closely related red pumpkin toadlet (B. pitanga) glowed under ultraviolet light, due to their fluorescent skeletons. Young that have gained the bright yellow-orange adult colours still lack their fluorescence. It was initially speculated that the fluorescent colour also is aposematic or that it is related to mate choice (species recognition or determining fitness of a potential partner), but later studies indicate that the former explanation is unlikely, as predation attempts on the toadlets appear to be unaffected by the presence/absence of fluorescence. Call and hearing Peculiarly, this species and the closely related red pumpkin toadlet are unable to hear the frequency of their own advertising calls, as their ears are underdeveloped. Instead their communication appears to rely on certain movements like the vocal sac that inflates when calling, mouth gaping and waving of their arms. It is speculated that their calling is a vestigiality from the ancestral form of the genus, whereas their reduced hearing ability (they do have some hearing ability in frequencies outside their call) is a novel change in these species. Sounds make them more vulnerable to predators, but there has likely been little direct evolutionary pressure to lose it because of their toxicity.

In general, subjective logic is suitable for modeling and analysing situations involving uncertainty and relatively unreliable sources.A. Jøsang. Subjective Logic: A formalism for reasoning under uncertainty. Springer Verlag, 2016A. Jøsang. Artificial Reasoning with Subjective Logic.

International Journal of Uncertainty, Fuzziness and Knowledge- Based Systems. 9(3), pp. 279–311, June 2001. PDF For example, it can be used for modeling and analysing trust networks and Bayesian networks. Arguments in subjective logic are subjective opinions about state variables which can take values from a domain (aka state space), where a state value can be thought of as a proposition which can be true or false. A binomial opinion applies to a binary state variable, and can be represented as a Beta PDF (Probability Density Function). A multinomial opinion applies to a state variable of multiple possible values, and can be represented as a Dirichlet PDF (Probability Density Function). Through the correspondence between opinions and Beta/Dirichlet distributions, subjective logic provides an algebra for these functions. Opinions are also related to the belief representation in Dempster–Shafer belief theory. A fundamental aspect of the human condition is that nobody can ever determine with absolute certainty whether a proposition about the world is true or false. In addition, whenever the truth of a proposition is expressed, it is always done by an individual, and it can never be considered to represent a general and objective belief. These philosophical ideas are directly reflected in the mathematical formalism of subjective logic. Subjective opinions Subjective opinions express subjective beliefs about the truth of state values/propositions with degrees of epistemic uncertainty, and can explicitly indicate the source of belief whenever required. An opinion is usually denoted as \\\\omega^{A}_{X} where A\\\\,\\\\\\\\! is the source of the opinion, and X\\\\,\\\\\\\\! is the state variable to which the opinion applies. The variable X\\\\,\\\\\\\\! can take values from a domain (also called state space) e.g. denoted as \\\\mathbb{X}. The values of a domain are assumed to be exhaustive and mutually disjoint, and sources are assumed to have a common semantic interpretation of a domain. The source and variable are attributes of an opinion. Indication of the source can be omitted whenever irrelevant. Binomial opinions Let x\\\\,\\\\\\\\! be a state value in a binary domain. A binomial opinion about the truth of state value x\\\\,\\\\\\\\! is the ordered quadruple \\\\omega_{x} = (b_x,d_x,u_x,a_x)\\\\,\\\\\\\\! where: {  b_x\\\\,\\\\\\\\!: belief mass  is the belief that x\\\\,\\\\\\\\! is true. -  d_x\\\\,\\\\\\\\!: disbelief mass  is the belief that x\\\\,\\\\\\\\! is false. -  u_x\\\\,\\\\\\\\!: uncertainty mass  is the amount of uncommitted belief, also interpreted as epistemic uncertainty. -  a_x\\\\,\\\\\\\\!: base rate  is the prior probability in the absence of belief or disbelief. } These components satisfy b_x+d_x+u_x=1\\\\,\\\\\\\\! and b_x,d_x,u_x,a_x \\\\in [0,1]\\\\,\\\\\\\\!. The characteristics of various opinion classes are listed below. {  An opinion  where b_x=1\\\\,\\\\\\\\!  is an absolute opinion which is equivalent to Boolean TRUE, -   where d_x=1\\\\,\\\\\\\\!  is an absolute opinion which is equivalent to Boolean FALSE, -   where b_x + d_x =1\\\\,\\\\\\\\!  is a dogmatic opinion which is equivalent to a traditional probability, -   where b_x + d_x < 1\\\\,\\\\\\\\!  is an uncertain opinion which expresses degrees of epistemic uncertainty, and -   where b_x + d_x = 0\\\\,\\\\\\\\!  is a vacuous opinion which expresses total epistemic uncertainty or total vacuity of belief. } The projected probability of a binomial opinion is defined as \\\\mathrm{P}_{x}=b_{x} + a_{x} u_{x}\\\\,\\\\\\\\!. Binomial opinions can be represented on an equilateral triangle as shown below. A point inside the triangle represents a (b_x,d_x,u_x)\\\\,\\\\\\\\! triple. The b,d,u-axes run from one edge to the opposite vertex indicated by the Belief, Disbelief or Uncertainty label. For example, a strong positive opinion is represented by a point towards the bottom right Belief vertex. The base rate, also called the prior probability, is shown as a red pointer along the base line, and the projected probability, \\\\mathrm{P}_{x}\\\\,\\\\\\\\!, is formed by projecting the opinion onto the base, parallel to the base rate projector line. Opinions about three values/propositions X, Y and Z are visualized on the triangle to the left, and their equivalent Beta PDFs (Probability Density Functions) are visualized on the plots to the right. The numerical values and verbal qualitative descriptions of each opinion are also shown. Example binomial opinions with corresponding Beta PDFs The Beta PDF is normally denoted as \\\\mathrm{Beta}(p(x);\\\\alpha,\\\\beta)\\\\,\\\\\\\\! where \\\\alpha\\\\,\\\\\\\\! and \\\\beta\\\\,\\\\\\\\! are its two strength parameters. The Beta PDF of a binomial opinion \\\\omega_x = (b_x,d_x,u_x,a_x)\\\\,\\\\\\\\! is the function \\\\mathrm{Beta}(p(x);\\\\alpha,\\\\beta) \\\\mbox{ where } \\\\begin{cases} \\\\alpha &= \\\\frac{Wb_x}{u_x}+Wa_x\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\beta &= \\\\frac{Wd_x}{u_x}+W(1-a_x) \\\\end{cases} \\\\,\\\\\\\\! where W is the non-informative prior weight, also called a unit of evidence, normally set to W=2. Multinomial opinions Let X\\\\,\\\\\\\\! be a state variable which can take state values x\\\\in\\\\mathbb{X}\\\\,\\\\\\\\!. A multinomial opinion over X\\\\,\\\\\\\\! is the composite tuple \\\\omega_{X}=(b_{X}, u_{X}, a_{X})\\\\,\\\\\\\\!, where b_{X}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! is a belief mass distribution over the possible state values of X\\\\,\\\\\\\\!, u_{X}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! is the uncertainty mass, and a_{X}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! is the prior (base rate) probability distribution over the possible state values of X\\\\,\\\\\\\\!. These parameters satisfy u_{X}+\\\\sum b_{X}(x) = 1\\\\,\\\\\\\\! and \\\\sum a_{X}(x) = 1\\\\,\\\\\\\\! as well as b_{X}(x),u_{X},a_{X}(x) \\\\in [0,1]\\\\,\\\\\\\\!. Trinomial opinions can be simply visualised as points inside a tetrahedron, but opinions with dimensions larger than trinomial do not lend themselves to simple visualisation. Dirichlet PDFs are normally denoted as \\\\mathrm{Dir}(p_{X};\\\\alpha_{X})\\\\,\\\\\\\\! where p_{X}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! is a probability distribution over the state values of X, and \\\\alpha_{X}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! are the strength parameters. The Dirichlet PDF of a multinomial opinion \\\\omega_{X} = (b_{X},u_{X},a_{X})\\\\,\\\\\\\\! is the function \\\\mathrm{Dir}(p_{X};\\\\alpha_{X}) where the strength parameters are given by \\\\alpha_{X}(x) = \\\\frac{Wb_{X}(x)}{u_{X}}+Wa_{X}(x)\\\\,\\\\\\\\! , where W is the non- informative prior weight, also called a unit of evidence, normally set to W=2. Operators Most operators in the table below are generalisations of binary logic and probability operators. For example addition is simply a generalisation of addition of probabilities. Some operators are only meaningful for combining binomial opinions, and some also apply to multinomial opinion. A. Jøsang. Probabilistic Logic Under Uncertainty. Proceedings of Computing: The Australian Theory Symposium (CATS'07), Ballarat, January 2007. PDF Most operators are binary, but complement is unary, and abduction is ternary.

For example, the transitive trust path from analyst/source A\\\\,\\\\\\\\! via source B\\\\,\\\\\\\\! to the variable X\\\\,\\\\\\\\! can be denoted as [A;B,X]\\\\,\\\\\\\\! in compact form, or as [A;B]:[B,X]\\\\,\\\\\\\\! in expanded form. Here, [A;B]\\\\,\\\\\\\\! expresses that A has some trust/distrust in source B, whereas [B,X]\\\\,\\\\\\\\! expresses that B has an opinion about the state of variable X which is given as an advice to A. The expanded form is the most general, and corresponds directly to the way subjective logic expressions are formed with operators. Properties In case the argument opinions are equivalent to Boolean TRUE or FALSE, the result of any subjective logic operator is always equal to that of the corresponding propositional/binary logic operator. Similarly, when the argument opinions are equivalent to traditional probabilities, the result of any subjective logic operator is always equal to that of the corresponding probability operator (when it exists). In case the argument opinions contain degrees of uncertainty, the operators involving multiplication and division (including deduction, abduction and Bayes' theorem) will produce derived opinions that always have correct projected probability but possibly with approximate variance when seen as Beta/Dirichlet PDFs. All other operators produce opinions where the projected probabilities and the variance are always analytically correct. Different logic formulas that traditionally are equivalent in propositional logic do not necessarily have equal opinions. For example \\\\omega_{x\\\\land (y\\\\lor z)} eq \\\\omega_{(x \\\\land y)\\\\lor (x\\\\land z)}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! in general although the distributivity of conjunction over disjunction, expressed as x\\\\land (y\\\\lor z) \\\\Leftrightarrow (x \\\\land y)\\\\lor (x\\\\land z)\\\\,\\\\\\\\!, holds in binary propositional logic. This is no surprise as the corresponding probability operators are also non-distributive. However, multiplication is distributive over addition, as expressed by \\\\omega_{x\\\\land (y\\\\cup z)} = \\\\omega_{(x \\\\land y)\\\\cup (x\\\\land z)}\\\\,\\\\\\\\!. De Morgan's laws are also satisfied as e.g. expressed by \\\\omega_{\\\\overline{x\\\\land y}} = \\\\omega_{\\\\overline{x} \\\\lor \\\\overline{y}}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! . Subjective logic allows very efficient computation of mathematically complex models. This is possible by approximation of the analytically correct functions. While it is relatively simple to analytically multiply two Beta PDFs in the form of a joint Beta PDF, anything more complex than that quickly becomes intractable. When combining two Beta PDFs with some operator/connective, the analytical result is not always a Beta PDF and can involve hypergeometric series. In such cases, subjective logic always approximates the result as an opinion that is equivalent to a Beta PDF. Applications Subjective logic is applicable when the situation to be analysed is characterised by considerable epistemic uncertainty due to incomplete knowledge. In this way, subjective logic becomes a probabilistic logic for epistemic-uncertain probabilities. The advantage is that uncertainty is preserved throughout the analysis and is made explicit in the results so that it is possible to distinguish between certain and uncertain conclusions. The modelling of trust networks and Bayesian networks are typical applications of subjective logic. Subjective trust networks Subjective trust networks can be modelled with a combination of the transitivity and fusion operators. Let [A;B]\\\\,\\\\\\\\! express the referral trust edge from A\\\\,\\\\\\\\! to B\\\\,\\\\\\\\!, and let [B,X]\\\\,\\\\\\\\! express the belief edge from B\\\\,\\\\\\\\! to X\\\\,\\\\\\\\!. A subjective trust network can for example be expressed as ([A;B]:[B,X])\\\\diamond([A;C]:[C,X])\\\\,\\\\\\\\! as illustrated in the figure below. Subjective trust network The indices 1, 2 and 3 indicate the chronological order in which the trust edges and advices are formed. Thus, given the set of trust edges with index 1, the origin trustor A\\\\,\\\\\\\\! receives advice from B\\\\,\\\\\\\\! and C\\\\,\\\\\\\\!, and is thereby able to derive belief in variable X\\\\,\\\\\\\\!. By expressing each trust edge and belief edge as an opinion, it is possible for A\\\\,\\\\\\\\! to derive belief in X\\\\,\\\\\\\\! expressed as \\\\omega^{A}_{X} = \\\\omega^{[A;B]\\\\diamond[A;C]}_{X} = (\\\\omega^{A}_{B}\\\\otimes \\\\omega^{B}_{X}) \\\\oplus (\\\\omega^{A}_{C}\\\\otimes \\\\omega^{C}_{X})\\\\,\\\\\\\\!. Trust networks can express the reliability of information sources, and can be used to determine subjective opinions about variables that the sources provide information about. Evidence-based subjective logic (EBSL) describes an alternative trust- network computation, where the transitivity of opinions (discounting) is handled by applying weights to the evidence underlying the opinions. Subjective Bayesian networks In the Bayesian network below, X\\\\,\\\\\\\\! and Y\\\\,\\\\\\\\! are parent variables and Z\\\\,\\\\\\\\! is the child variable. The analyst must learn the set of joint conditional opinions \\\\omega_{ZXY} in order to apply the deduction operator and derive the marginal opinion \\\\omega_{Z\\\\XY} on the variable Z. The conditional opinions express a conditional relationship between the parent variables and the child variable. Subjective Bayesian network The deduced opinion is computed as \\\\omega_{Z\\\\XY} = \\\\omega_{ZXY} \\\\circledcirc \\\\omega_{XY}. The joint evidence opinion \\\\omega_{XY} can be computed as the product of independent evidence opinions on X\\\\,\\\\\\\\! and Y\\\\,\\\\\\\\!, or as the joint product of partially dependent evidence opinions. Subjective networks The combination of a subjective trust network and a subjective Bayesian network is a subjective network. The subjective trust network can be used to obtain from various sources the opinions to be used as input opinions to the subjective Bayesian network, as illustrated in the figure below. Subjective network Traditional Bayesian network typically do not take into account the reliability of the sources. In subjective networks, the trust in sources is explicitly taken into account.

This poem written as a devotional prayer to Guruvayoorappan is considered as an important work in Malayalam literature.Medieval Indian Literature: An Anthology By K. Ayyappapanicker Written in simple Malayalam, the Jnanappana was Poonthanam's magnum opus and is an important work of Bhakti literature from Kerala and is revered for its poetic merit and intensity of devotion. About Jnanappana can be considered as the Bhagavad Gita of Malayali Hindus. This is a darshanika kavyam or philosophical poem expressed in simple Malayalam for ordinary people. The Jnanappana is noted for its literary quality, the use of simple phrases, its philosophical strength and reflects Poonthanam's deep bhakti to Guruvayoorappan. Jnanappana consists of 360 lines of verse written in the pana metre of Malayalam poetry. The Jnanappana is noted for its use of opposing images through which Poonthanam draws out the cosmic acts of Krishna through the web of karma. In the Jnanappana, Poonthanam Namboothiri, an ardent devotee of Shri Guruvayurappan, transforms his unbearable sorrow from his infant son’s death into a yogavishesham. He used this sad experience to build his Bhakti soudham or house of devotion and opens it for all devotees for all time. The line \\"unnikrishnan manasil kalikumbol,unnikal mattu venamo makkalai\\" (When the baby Krishna plays in one's mind, does one need one's own children?) expresses the poet's grief at the death of his child and his deep devotion to Guruvayurappan even in that grief-stricken state. Even though the language is very simple, Jnanappana, or song of wisdom deals within it with the essence of the Srimad Bhagavatam, Bhagavad Gita, Bhajagovindam, Viveka Chudamani and Narayaneeyam. According to legend, Poonthanam's humility and unflinching devotion prompted Guruvayoorappan to prefer the poem to Poonthanam's contemporary and literary rival Melpathur Narayana Bhattathiri’s ‘Narayaneeyam’. The devotional hymn ‘Kandu Kandangirikkum Janangale’ is from the Jnanappana.

Established in 1982, the campus serves more than 4,000 students supported by 17 bachelor'shttps://pc.fsu.edu/academics/undergraduate-programs and 8 graduate degreehttps://pc.fsu.edu/academics/graduate-programs programs on campus and online. Recognizing the need for four-year degree programs in the Bay County area in the early 1970s, members of the local business community, the Naval Coastal Systems Center, Gulf Coast Community College, the Bay County School Board and Tyndall Air Force Base began lobbying for an institution of higher learning. Shortly after the community began lobbying, the Florida Board of Regents (BOR) instituted a plan to make higher education available to Florida citizens living in major population areas located beyond a reasonable commuting distance (50 miles) of a state-supported university. In 1972, the BOR directed the University of West Florida to establish a center in Panama City. Classes began that summer with an enrollment of 65 elementary education students and a staff of two. Facilities for the center were located in the Bay County School Board Office Building and Gulf Coast Community College. In 1976, the Bay County Commission purchased located between Gulf Coast Community College and the beautiful waters of North Bay. The commission deeded the land to the State for use by the center. In 1981 the commission donated an additional and three quadriplex buildings. In the fall of 1982, the State Legislature and the BOR transferred administrative responsibility for the Panama City Center to the Florida State University. The new FSU at Panama City began operating with six administrative and support staff, five resident faculty, 531 students, and 11 degree programs. Classes continued to be held in the Bay County School Board Office Building and Gulf Coast Community College. Administrative offices were moved to the quadriplex buildings. When FSU accepted responsibility for the Panama City campus, it was apparent that five resident faculty could not provide all the instructional support necessary to meet the demands of a new campus. The University realized that if educational quality and program consistency were to be maintained, it would be essential for the majority of the courses on the Panama City campus to be taught by regular FSU faculty. So, a plan was developed to transport Tallahassee faculty the to Panama City. Two vans were placed on daily round trips from Tallahassee to Panama City. On June 23, 1983, ground breaking occurred for the $9.1 million Phase I development of FSU at Panama City. The new facilities were formally dedicated on March 22, 1986. The administrative building was named in honor of Senator Dempsey J. Barron, who sponsored the bill that secured funds for the permanent location of an FSU facility in Panama City. The new campus facilities opened for students in January 1987. In March 1987, an additional along the bay were deeded to the State for use by the campus. This donation brought the campus to its current size of . A new conference center facility was completed in January 2000, and the master plan for the development of the campus over the next decade included the construction of facilities, student life and academic buildings. On June 8, 2012, The Florida State University's Board of Trustees approved a four-year academic plan for FSU Panama City which allowed the campus to offer a limited range of general-education and lower- level courses that are focused on upper-level majors offered at FSU Panama City.

With more than 2,000 members, AWRA is the pre-eminent multidisciplinary U.S. organization in the field. AWRA’s membership includes engineers, educators, foresters, biologists, ecologists, geographers, managers, regulators, hydrologists, hydro-geologists, attorneys, economists, and water policy specialists. AWRA organizes conferences, publishes the peer-reviewed Journal of the American Water Resources Association (JAWRA), the Water Resources IMPACT magazine, and sponsors various member committees, State Sections and Student Chapters. AWRA has a seat on the Board of Directors of the Renewable Natural Resources Foundation (RNRF), is a Member of the World Water Council, and participates in the WWC triennial World Water Forum. Conferences AWRA typically sponsors two-to-three conferences a year: a Spring Specialty Conference, a Summer Specialty Conference, and an Annual Water Resources Conference (held in November). The three-day Specialty Conferences focus on areas such as Geological Information Systems, Riparian Ecosystems, Adaptive Management, Emerging Contaminants in the Environment, Wetlands Restoration, Watershed Management, Agricultural Hydrology, Coastal Water Resources, and Climate Change. The four-day Annual Conferences offer a comprehensive program of technical and policy oral and poster presentations, plenary sessions, field trips and workshops. The AWRA also occasionally holds Water Policy Dialogues focusing on water policy and management at the local, state and federal levels. Additionally, the AWRA periodically co-hosts international conferences with other international water resources organizations. Publications Each conference produces a proceedings (now available electronically, though earlier proceedings were in print): the Specialty Conference proceedings may include papers and abstracts, while the Annual Conference proceedings include abstracts only. The Journal of the American Water Resources Association (JAWRA). JAWRA publishes original papers on broad topics related to water resource issues. All papers are refereed prior to publication. JAWRA is published bi-monthly, beginning with the February issue. Prior to 1997, JAWRA was known as Water Resources Bulletin. Water Resources IMPACT Magazine, originally started as a newsletter, evolved into a magazine with articles addressing the practical issues of water resources management. Published bi- monthly, each issue is devoted to a particular topic. Some recent issues include Water Infrastructure Resilience, Geospatial Water Technology, U.S. Western Water Issues, including Colorado River Management.  Webinars  AWRA hosts monthly webinars as well as selected webinar series on a variety of topics. Webinars are free to AWRA members and available for a registration fee for non-members. Technical Committees Open only to members, the committees promote an open exchange of ideas on a variety of current topics of concern: Flowing Waters, Future Risk, Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM), Policy, and Technology. Caulfield Medal Since 1988, AWRA has periodically awarded a Henry P. Caulfield, Jr. Medal for Exemplary Contributions to National Water Policy to an individual who has achieved eminence in shaping national water policy. On presentation of the first medal to Caulfield in 1988, AWRA President Raymond Herrmann said: \\"this medal was established to honor an individual whose record of achievements and contributions in setting, designing, and implementing water resources policies at the national level have been extraordinary.\\"AWRA establishes medal in honor of Henry P. Caulfield, Jr. Bethesda, MD: American Water Resources Association, November 9, 1988. News release. Maidment Award In 2010 at its Spring Specialty Conference on GIS & Water Resources, AWRA awarded the AWRA Award for Exemplary Contributions to Water Resources Data and Information Systems to David R. Maidment, and then announced its decision to name this award after him. This award recognizes individuals who have made sustained contributions to water resources data by providing leadership in the provision of particular kinds of data, or by improving synthesis of water data using geographic and other information systems. It is awarded in conjunction with the AWRA Specialty Conferences on the topic.  Other Awards, & Scholarships  AWRA annually names recipients of numerous other awards, and also awards several scholarships.

He was known as \\"El Mero León del Corrido\\" (The Boss Lion of the Corrido). Life and career Beto Quintanilla was originally from General Terán, a small town in Nuevo León, Mexico. The date of his birth is unknown, but was some time in the late 1940s. As a child, Quintanilla composed poems or odes to his mother, his teacher, his school, and his country. He left school after only a year of secondary education in order to work in fields alongside his father and his five brothers. His extended family also included three male relatives and two women. The farm was not enough to support the entire family and when he was 13 years old, young Beto relocated to Reynosa, Tamaulipas, where he had found a job milking cows. He did this for a year, and then worked with an aunt in a clothing store for several years. Quintanilla never had any formal musical training. Although he had always written poetry and songs, musical instruments and musical training were scarce, and he knew few musicians. However, at some time during his life on the ranch, he did meet a pair of musicians who played bajo sexto and accordion. He began writing songs for them, and then songs for other groups. Eventually he came to the attention of Ruben Polanco, the artistic director of a record company, and Polanco encouraged him to sing his songs himself. Apparently Quintanilla initially objected that he did not know how to sing and felt out of place when he sang. Polanco told him not to waste time [with excuses], that he (Polanco) wanted to sign artists like Quintanilla, and that he (Quintanilla) had a unique style and presence. Quintanilla died in Reynosa, Mexico, on 18 March 2007. The cause of death was a heart attack, said to be related to a drug overdose. Legacy Quintanilla recorded mostly narcocorridos, many of which he composed. He recorded more than 20 albums in his lifetime, not including collections of hits. After his death, many of his albums were re-released, and his songs appeared on various collections released by different record companies. Some of these collections have misleading titles: for instance, the album \\"La Ejecución De Juan\\" [English: \\"The Execution of Juan\\"], released in 2009, apparently does not contain the song \\"La Ejecución De Juan\\", which was on the original album, a concept album of the same title. (The album cover shown is another album entirely, making the matter more confusing.) Other posthumous releases or the publicity for them imply that the material on them is new, or even that Quintanilla is still alive. Quintanilla wrote and performed a substantial number of songs, well over 100, but due to all the album releases, some of his songs appear on two, three or four albums, making his discography much larger than the body of work behind it. In 2006, Beto recorded an album with his look-alike and sound-alike brother, Jesus \\"Chuy\\" Quintanilla, called \\"Frente A Frente\\" [English: \\"Face to Face\\"]. Chuy Quintanilla carried on the family narcocorrido tradition until 2013, when he was murdered near Mission, Texas. Beto's son, Beto Quintanilla Jr., recorded an album of his father's songs, \\"Homenaje a Mi Padre\\" [English: \\"Respects To My Father\\"] in 2007, soon after his father died. Beto Quintanilla's famous songs include \\"El Deportado\\", \\"Le Compre La Muerte a Mi Hijo\\", \\"Raquenel Villanueva\\", \\"El Gordo Paz\\", \\"El Sapo\\", \\"Los Pilares de la Carcel\\", \\"El Calabozo\\", \\"La Carga Ladeada\\", \\"Un Ratoncito Orejon\\", and \\"El Corrido de Los Zetas.\\" These songs remain concert and studio standards for bands that play corridos. Discography The discography assumes that if there are two albums of the same name, the later album is a re-release of the first, although as noted above, in at least one case this seems to be untrue.

Geosternbergia was one of the largest pterosaur genera, and had a wingspan of up to . Discovery and history The first fossils of Geosternbergia was collected by American paleontologist George F. Sternberg in 1952 from the lower portion of the Niobrara Formation. The fossils of the animal looked similar to those of the species Pteranodon longiceps, but the crests were set upright and in a slightly different position. In 1958, Sternberg and paleontologist Myrl V. Walker published a study about this peculiar find. In 1966, American paleontologist John Christian Harksen assigned the specimens found as a new species of Pteranodon called P. sternbergi due to its distinct upright crest that set it apart from P. longiceps. Halsey W. Miller however, concluded a revision of the different species of Pteranodon in 1971, and created three different subgenera. One of which was Sternbergia, which consisted of the Pteranodon specimens with upright crests. P. sternbergi was assigned to this subgenus along with another species called P. walkeri, but Miller then found out that the name Sternbergia had been preoccupied, so he changed it into Geosternbergia instead. Paleontologists like S. Christopher Bennett consider Geosternbergia to be older than P. longiceps, and therefore the direct ancestor of that species. Specimen UALVP 24238 with reconstructed crest; the specimen is now considered to be the holotype of Dawndraco kanzai The most complete example of the species, currently in the collections of the University of Alberta Laboratory for Vertebrate Paleontology as specimen number UALVP 24238, is a partially-articulated sub-adult fossil with a wingspan of about . The skeleton is missing only parts of the skull and the ends of the wings and feet, was discovered in 1974 near Utica, Kansas. The fossil was found by Richard C. Fox and Allen Lindoe in rocks belonging to the lower part of the Smoky Hill Chalk Member of the Niobrara Formation. These rocks date to the late Coniacian or early Santonian stage, about 86 million years ago. In 2010, a paper by Alexander W.A. Kellner argued that this specimen was different enough from G. sternbegi that it should be re- classified as its own genus and species, which he named Dawndraco kanzai. This generic name combined the Dawn deity of the Iroquois with a Latin draco, \\"dragon\\". The specific name refers to the Kanza tribe of Kansas. Kellner thought that several features of the skeleton supported his hypothesis that D. kanzai was a unique species, most notably its unique snout, which does not strongly taper towards the tip as in female Pteranodon specimens, with the upper and lower margins running almost parallel instead. Kellner thought this meant the specimen must have had a crest running along the length of the snout. However, a re-examination of the fossil published in 2017 by Elizabeth Martin-Silverstone and colleagues argued that the differences in the snout were more likely due to male pteranodontids having longer, broader bills than the more complete female specimens Kellner used for comparison. Martin- Silverstone concluded that \\"Dawndraco\\" was simply a male G. sternbergi with a very long bill with a gradual taper. Geosternbergia fossils are known from the Niobrara and Sharon Springs Formations of the central United States. Geosternbergia existed as a group for more than four million years during the late Coniacian - early Campanian stages of the Cretaceous period. The genus is present in the lower the Niobrarra Formation except for the upper two; in 2003, Kenneth Carpenter surveyed the distribution and dating of fossils in this formation, demonstrating that Geosternbergia sternbergi existed there from 88-85 million years ago, while the species later named G. maiseyi existed between 81.5 and 80.5 million years ago. Description Size Size of G. sternbergi male (green) and female (orange) compared with a human Geosternbergia was among the largest pterosaurs, with the wingspan of most adults ranging between . No complete skulls of adult males have been found, but a nearly complete lower jaw has been estimated at long.Zimmerman, H., Preiss, B., and Sovak, J. (2001). Beyond the Dinosaurs!: sky dragons, sea monsters, mega-mammals, and other prehistoric beasts, Simon and Schuster. . While most specimens are found crushed, enough fossils exist to put together a detailed description of the animal. Geosternbergia sternbergi was very similar to the more well-known pterosaur species Pteranodon longiceps and is often considered simply an earlier species of Pteranodon itself. It is different from Pteranodon mainly due to its earlier time period and broader, more upright crest. Skull and beak The upright cranial crest of Geosternbergia is its distinctive characteristic. These crests consisted of skull bones (frontals) projecting upward and backward from the skull. The size and shape of these crests varied due to a number of factors, including age, gender, and species. Male G. sternbergi, the older species of the two described to date, had a larger vertical crest with a broad forward projection, while G. maiseyi had a short, rounded vertical crest and was generally smaller. Females of both species were smaller and bore small, rounded crests. The crests were probably mainly display structures, though they may have had other functions as well. Unlike the earlier pterosaurs, such as the rhamphorhynchids and the pterodactylids, Geosternberigia had a toothless beak that was made of solid, bony margins that projected from the base of the jaws, similar to modern-day birds. The structure of the beaks were long, slender, and ended in thin, sharp points. Its maxilla was also found to be longer than the mandible, and was curved upward. Classification Restoration of a male G. sternbergi Reconstruction of a female G. sternbergi skeleton (specimen NMC41-358), with a small crest Geosternbergia was traditionally considered a species, or occasionally subgenus, of the similar pterosaur Pteranodon, in most major studies of pteranodontians through the 1990s. However, a 2010 review of the group by A.W.A. Kellner suggested that Pteranodon sternbergi was different enough from P. longiceps to belong in a distinct genus, to which Kellner also referred a new species, Geosternbergia maiseyi. Earlier, pterosaur researcher Chris Bennett had considered the G. maiseyi specimen an adult male P. longiceps. Below is a cladogram showing the phylogenetic placement of this genus within Pteranodontia from Andres and Myers (2013). Paleobiology Sexual variation Variations in cranial anatomy by gender, age, and species (left, drawn to scale) Adult Geosternbergia specimens may be divided into two distinct size classes, small and large, with the large size class being about one and a half times larger than the small, and the small being twice as common as the large. Both size classes lived alongside each other, and while researchers had previously suggested that they represent different species, Christopher Bennett showed that the differences between them are consistent with the concept that they represent females and males, and that Geosternbergia species were sexually dimorphic. Skulls from the larger size class preserve large, upward and backward pointing crests, while the crests of the smaller size class are small and triangular. Some larger skulls also show evidence of a second crest that extended long and low, toward the tip of the beak, which is not seen in smaller specimens. The gender of the different size classes was determined, not from the skulls, but from the pelvic bones. Contrary to what may be expected, the smaller size class had disproportionately large and wide-set pelvic bones. Bennett interpreted this as indicating a more spacious birth canal, through which eggs would pass. He concluded that the small size class with small, triangular crests represent females, and the larger, large-crested specimens represent males. Note that the overall size and crest size also corresponds to age. Immature specimens are known from both females and males, and immature males often have small crests similar to adult females. Therefore, it seems that the large crests only developed in males when they reached their large, adult size, making the gender of immature specimens difficult to establish from partial remains. The fact that females appear to have outnumbered males two to one suggests that, as with modern animals with size-related sexual dimorphism, such as sea lions and other pinnipeds, Geosternbergia might have been polygynous, with a few males competing for association with groups consisting of large numbers of females. Similar to modern pinnipeds, Geosternbergia may have competed to establish territory on rocky, offshore rookeries, with the largest, and largest-crested, males gaining the most territory and having more success mating with females. The crests of male Geosternbergia would not have been used in competition, but rather as \\"visual dominance-rank symbols\\", with display rituals taking the place of physical competition with other males. If this hypothesis is correct, it also is likely that male Geosternbergia played little to no part in rearing the young; such a behavior is not found in the males of modern polygynous animals who father many offspring at the same time.

Stone. The firm was acquired by Cogan, Berlind, Weill & Levitt in 1972 and, after its name disappeared in 1979, was part of what would become Shearson/American Express in 1981. History In 1892, Clark, Ward, & Co. clerks Charles Hayden (later the benefactor of the Hayden Planetarium) and Galen L. Stone opened a new brokerage house, Hayden, Stone & Co. While Stone was known for remaining silent, Hayden gained a reputation for quick decisions and mastery of the brokerage business. Foreseeing the needs of electrification, Hayden made his fortune by investing in copper mining. The new investment firm prospered, expanding from its Boston base to open a New York City branch in 1906. CBWL logo In 1970, the prestigious Hayden, Stone found itself in financial trouble along with many other large securities firms. Hayden, Stone was acquired by Cogan, Berlind, Weill & Levitt (often jokingly referred to as Corned Beef With Lettuce), whose partners included Sandy Weill and Arthur Levitt, and renamed itself CBWL-Hayden, Stone, dropping the CBWL from the name just two years later, allowing Weill to rid himself of the Corned Beef With Lettuce moniker. The new Hayden Stone, Inc. then completed possibly its most significant acquisition to that point, merging with Shearson, Hammill & Co.. Once again, Weill chose to adopt the target's branding to become Shearson Hayden Stone. The Hayden Stone name was finally abandoned in 1979, following the acquisition of Loeb, Rhoades, Hornblower & Co. to form Shearson Loeb Rhoades. Just two years later, in 1981, Weill sold the combined company to American Express to form Shearson/American Express. At one point, the firm was considered to be the third largest \\"wire-house\\" in the country behind only Merrill Lynch and Bache & Co..

It has been used as a sensory exploration device for low-vision individuals. Types and basic operation song is \\"Huron Carol\\"; \\"Une Jeune Pucelle\\" A young musician plays the hydraulophone by pressing on jets of water laid out to a musical scale. Waterflute (reedless) hydraulophone with 45 finger-embouchure holes, allowing an intricate but polyphonic embouchure-like control by inserting one finger into each of several of the instrument's 45 mouths at once The term may be applied based on the interface used to play the instrument, in which a player blocks the flow of water through a particular hole in order to sound a particular note, or based on a hydraulic sound production mechanism. Hydraulophones use water-flow sound-producing mechanisms. They have a user interface, which is blocking water jets to produce sound. Those described in Mann's paper Hydraulophone design considerations use water jets striking perforated spinning disks, shafts, or valves, to create a pulsating water flow, similar to a siren disk. A single disk, shaft, or valve assembly can have rings or passages with different numbers of holes for different notes. Some hydraulophones have reeds (one or more reed for each finger hole) and some are reedless, having one or more fipple mechanism associated with each finger hole, thus having no moving parts to wear out. Blocking flow through a finger hole directs the water instead to one or more of the above-described sound-production mechanisms, or resulting changes in flow or pressure affect a separate sounding mechanism associated with each finger hole. Blocking water from coming out of a given hole produces a given note, which, in some embodiments, is electrically amplified by a hydrophone. In one embodiment there is a further processing of each hydrophone signal. Embodiments with various kinds of acoustic or optical pickups are also disclosed. Some hydraulophones include an underwater hydrophone pickup to allow the sounds produced by the water to be electrically amplified. Electric amplification allows effects to be added (as with an electric guitar) as well as making the hydraulophone a hyper-acoustic instrument (that is, using computation to change the acoustic sound of the water into some other instrument).\\"The Electric Hydraulophone: An acoustic hyperinstrument with feedback\\", International Computer Music Conference, Pp. 162, Copenhagen, Denmark. Embouchure The water must be \\"blown\\" into the hydraulophone by way of a pump which can be hand-operated, wind operated, water powered, or electric. Unlike woodwind instruments in which there is one mouthpiece at the entrance to the flute chamber, hydraulophones have mouthpieces at every exit port from the chamber. Whereas internal ducted flutes have one fipple mechanism for the mouth of the player, along with several finger holes that share the one fipple mechanism, the hydraulophone has a separate mouth/mouthpiece for each finger hole. A typical park- hydraulophone for installation in public spaces has 12 mouths, whereas a concert hydraulophone typically has 45 mouths. Embouchure is controlled by way of the instrument's mouths, not the player's mouth such that the player can sing along with the hydraulophone (i.e. a player can sing and play the instrument at the same time). Moreover, the instrument provides the unique capability of polyphonic embouchure, where a player can dynamically \\"sculpt\\" each note by the shape and position of each finger inserted into each of the mouths. For example, the sound is different when fingering the center of a water jet than when fingering the water jet near the periphery of the circular mouth's opening. Relationships to other instruments Kinematics and musical instruments Woodwind The hydraulophone is similar to a woodwind instrument, but it runs on incompressible (or less compressible) fluid rather than a compressible gas like air. In this context hydraulophones are sometimes called \\"woodwater\\" instruments regardless of whether or not they are made of wood (as woodwind instruments are often not made of wood). Pipe organ Many hydraulophones include a separate water-filled pipe for each note, and have sound-production means similar to pipe organs (but with water rather than air), while maintaining the flutelike user-interface (finger embouchure holes). This form of hydraulophone is similar to an organ, but has water flowing through the pipes instead of air flowing through the pipes. Piano On a concert hydraulophone, the finger holes are arranged like the keys on a piano, i.e. there is a row of uniformly spaced holes close to the player, and a row of holes that are in groups of 2, 3, 2, 3, ..., a little further from the player. Whereas the piano and organ both have a similar kind of keyboard layout, the response (\\"key action\\") is different. Pianos tend to respond to velocity (how quickly a key is struck), whereas organs tend to respond to displacement (whether or not a key is pressed down). Hydraulophones tend to respond to the time-integral of displacement (total water flow), as well as to displacement, velocity, and to some degree jerk and jounce . Instruments that use other states of water The pagophone uses ice, in contrast to the hydraulophone which typically uses liquid water The hydraulophone uses liquid, typically water. It is thus related to the pagophone, an instrument that uses ice, and the calliope, an instrument that uses steam. 12-jet diatonic Many diatonic hydraulophones are built with 12 water jets, one for each of the instrument's 12 notes. The standard compass starts on A, extending up an octave and a half to E. Extended playing ranges for a diatonic 12-water-jet hydraulophone The standard A to E range, in which it is possible to play with polyphonic embouchure on any or all diatonic notes at the same time, is shown on the left side of the diagram. When playing only monophonically, some additional range is possible on certain hydraulophones, indicated here by small cue notes at the end-points. Left, the extended notes come from closing key change valves or flexing key change levers, for sharpener, and flattener. To play a low G, one must be playing in C minor (with A) and close the flattener valve simultaneously. When playing on the high E jet, closing the sharpener valve produces an F. With change-valves, the diatonic hydraulophone is polyphonic in the same sense as a so-called \\"chromatic harmonica\\" – you can play chords and move all members of a chord down one semitone or up one semitone together, but the function of the valves is usually not separated to work on a per-note basis, so for example, you can play an A-minor chord, and flex the entire chord down to A-flat minor, but you can't easily play an A major chord without the use of polyphonic embouchure to bend only the middle note to a C (which requires more skill than the average hydraulist has). Thus the \\"diatonic\\" hydraulophone is called \\"diatonic\\" conservatively to \\"under promise and over-deliver\\". Finally, on the right, the additional extended range comes from the two octave-change valves (all notes can be shifted as many as two octaves down, or one octave up). Markings Braille markings above finger holes on a classroom hydraulophone used for teaching visually impaired students. The letter \\"L\\" denotes jet number 12 (rightmost in the sequence of 12 water jets). Because the water-spray from hydraulophones obscures vision (or because hydraulophones are played underwater where visibility is poor), finger holes are sometimes encoded in Braille. Braille has the added advantage that the one-to-one correspondence between letters and numbers is the same as the standard A-minor hydraulophone, i.e. jet 1 is A, jet 2 is B, jet 3 is C, etc.. The skill (intricate sense of tactility) needed to play a hydraulophone well is also similar to the skill needed to read Braille. A, 1 B, 2 C, 3 D, 4 E, 5 F, 6 G, 7 H, 8 I, 9 J, 0 K L (12 sets of dots typically made from brass pins above each finger hole) 45-jet chromatic / concert Playing range of a 45-jet hydraulophone Whereas park and pool hydraulophones are usually 12-jet diatonic, concert- hydraulophones are usually 45-jet chromatic. 45-jet hydraulophones have a 3 octave range of A to E, chromatic, plus an additional A-flat below the lowest A. The playing compass (45 water jets) is the same as the sounding range (45 notes). 12-jet hydraulophones are installed in public spaces, but there is a 45-jet south hydraulophone at the Ontario Science Centre, a concert- hydraulophone having this precise range and compass. Themed Aquatune Hydraulophone at the main entrance to the Legoland waterpark in Carlsbad California. This hydraulophone is in the shape of giant lego blocks. As public art installations, hydraulophones can be made in various themes and designs. An example of a theme-specific hydraulophone is the Aquatune located at the main entrance to the Legoland waterpark in Carlsbad California. This hydraulophone, which Legoland describes as \\"a musical water stand\\",\\"Imagination Station - LEGOLAND\\", (Accessed 15 September 2015). is the centerpiece of the entranceway, and is flanked on either side by educational installation exhibits, such as water tables where participants can build water dams from lego blocks, and learn about laminar and turbulent flows through various flow channels. Cold weather Hot tub hydraulophone Hydraulophones may be built into hot tubs for use in cold weather. This solves the problem of keeping the hydraulist warm, as well as keeping the hydraulic fluid (e.g. water) heated by way of standard pumping and heating equipment. In this kind of hydraulophone (e.g. balnaphone, from the Greek \\"balnea\\" meaning \\"bath\\") the hydraulist is immersed in the hydraulic fluid used by the instrument. Percussion hydraulophone Most hydraulophones sound continuously for as long as a finger hole is blocked. However, the WaterHammer hydraulophone produces sound from impact (water hammer) that dies down after being initially struck, thus sounding more like a piano than the more typical \\"underwater pipe organ\\" hydraulophone. The WaterHammer Hydraulophone uses the water hammer principle for hard-hitting percussive musical notes.US Patent 8,017,858\\"User- interfaces based on the water-hammer effect\\", ACM (Association of Computing Machinery) conference on Tangible Embedded and Embodied Interaction. .

Description of the castle The castle is built on a trapezoid plan, and originally had a tall cylindrical tower at each corner and a rectangular tower in the middle of one of the long sides. An entrance was formed in the wall between two of the towers. One tower (12m diameter) was much larger than the others (8m) and served as the keep.

It is endemic to South Africa, and lives in fast-moving streams. Description Ghost frogs get their name as one of the six species found in Skeleton Gorge (on Table Mountain), South Africa. The underside of the body, including the jaw, has small hooks, which help the frogs climb over wet rocks near their habitats. The frogs measure in length. It is in the same size range as Hewitt's ghost frog, but is smaller than Purcell's ghost frog. The top side of its body is brown with yellow spots, and the underside is white. The limbs are plain-colored, and flesh-colored underneath. Their tadpoles take up to two years to develop fully. The call of the royal ghost frog is a harsh, creaking sound, given at around one call per second. Habitat All species of ghost frogs are endemic to the southern tip of Africa. Its natural habitat is fynbos heathland in the Western and Eastern provinces of South Africa, and specifically cool mountain streams at an altitude of 230–790 meters. It is threatened by habitat loss, as it requires clean, fast-moving water in which to live. However, the International Union for Conservation of Nature classes the species as Least Concern; although it lives in an area of less than , the habitat is not currently threatened, and the species is presumed to have a large population.

It is a medium-sized species with purple or brown blotches on a pale green background and large discs on its fingers and toes. It has a very restricted range, being only known from the slopes of parts of Table Mountain. The tadpoles live in permanent streams but these are in danger of drying up because of the establishment of pine plantations. Because of its small range and changes in its habitat, this frog is listed as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Description This is a moderately sized frog, with the larger female up to and the smaller male up to in length. The coloration of adults is striking, often a pale green background with purple to brown blotches. The fingers and toes have large, triangular terminal discs. A rudimentary thumb is present as a distinct inner metacarpal tubercle. The feet are half webbed, with one phalanx of the fifth toe free of web. The tadpole has neither an upper nor lower jaw sheath, but up to 17 rows of posterior labial teeth. The tadpole also has a large oral disc and is able to climb up wet vertical rock faces. Distribution This species is known only from the southern, eastern, and marginally western slopes of Table Mountain in Cape Town. Habitat The typical habitat of this frog includes moist, forested gorges, with vertical rock faces to more exposed streams surrounded by dense marginal vegetation, the latter habitat usually found at higher altitudes. Tadpoles require year-round supply of water whereas adults can stray away from streams, even to be found in caves. Behaviour The frogs are found on rock ledges or up in vegetation at night, retreating under large rocks and in cracks of rocks during the day. Diet These frogs eat a range of small insects and other forest arthropods. Reproduction Breeding starts in November when the streams are low but the temperature is high. The male's secondary sexual characteristics include a number of small black spines on the outside surfaces of the forearms, on the back, and on the top of the back legs. The eggs have not been found, but in other species they are deposited under rocks in streams. The tadpoles develop for about 12 months. Conservation status This species is listed as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and in the South African Red Data Book. The population is small, geographically restricted, and threatened by the plantations of pines on the mountain that cause the streams to dry up. Many of the streams historically populated by Heleophryne rosei were diverted during the 1900s in order to supply the newly built reservoirs on Table Mountain.

Edwall is part of the Reardan-Edwall School District. The former Edwall School is now owned by the Parks and Recreation District and leased to Christian Heritage School, a private non-denominational school. In February 2014 record heat caused the small Creek to overflow and flood the center of town and causing permanent damage and closure to Edwall's post office. Edwall also has an active United Methodist Church congregation, Men's Service Club, Women in Action Committee, volunteer fire/emergency medical crew, and a volunteer run library located in the original one room wood frame schoolhouse. History Peter Edwall was the first to settle in the area in 1881 where he began a ranch. He was followed by William Spence, from Medical Lake, who homesteaded on the site of the future town. Mr. Edwall bought Spence's land in 1887. When the Great Northern Railway laid its main line across his land in 1892, Edwall platted a town site and named it after himself. Edwall's first buildings were constructed by the railroad and included a depot, water tank and other small storage buildings. These were soon followed by a church and a general store in 1893. Growth between The Panic of 1893 and 1897 was slow. In 1897, following a bountiful wheat harvest that boosted Lincoln County's economy, Edwall experienced a boom. A newspaper and bank were soon established as well as a large hotel and the population by 1903 had reached 275.  Education Reardan-Edwall School District serves Edwall.

He was a Catalan, a Franciscan, and a bachelor of theology. He is the only well-known archbishop of Athens from the fourteenth century. During his stay in Athens, he lived in an annex of the Erechtheum. Ballester was elected to his archbishopric with the support of the Republic of Venice and he had influence himself in Italy. Ballester supported Peter IV of Aragon against Maria of Sicily in 1381. He also supported the Crown of Aragon over and against the Navarrese Company. In November 1379 Sibilia, queen of Peter IV, tried to procure those relics of the Virgin which were kept at Athens from Ballester and since they were absent the Parthenon in 1395, it seems likely that she succeeded. On his death, John I of Aragon requested Antipope Clement VII to appoint one Antonio de Blasis to the vacant see. While some modern historians have doubted that Ballester was in fact dead when John requested the appointment of de Blasis, it has now been proven that he was. It was sometimes held that Ballester had in fact been captured by Nerio I Acciajuoli and later crowned Martin of Aragon in 1399, but this is false and arose from a confusion of the two Antonios.

Located in the West Wallaga Zone of the Oromia Region, the town has a latitude and longitude of with an elevation of 1673 meters above sea level. Begi is the administrative center of Begi Anaa. Currently, the district (Anaa) is divided into two districts: Begi and Qondaala districts as of 2005. Begi has enjoyed telephone service since the 1930s.\\"Local History in Ethiopia\\" The Nordic Africa Institute website (accessed 30 December 2007) The school in Begi started in 1953 as an elementary school (grades one through six), and in 1975 was upgraded to a junior secondary school, also offering education in grades seven and eight.Ralph Siebert, Kati Siebert, Klaus Wedekind, \\"Sociolinguistic Survey Report on Languages of the Asosa - Begi - Komosha Area, Part I\\", SIL International, 2002. (accessed 30 December 2008) The town also hosted an unpaved airfield with regular flights by Ethiopian Airlines, now abandoned and in state of disrepair, and has postal service.  History  The Dutch explorer Juan Maria Schuver visited Begi during his first explorations between the White and Blue Niles (August 1881). He described the settlement as \\"a large village\\" that was recovering from a recent famine, but at the time of his visit \\"with extensive plantations of durra, maize, angolib (a species of edible, sweet durra-stalk) and cabbage. Every house had its small garden of tobacco, beans, yams and shieta, the minute red pepper.\\"Wendy James, Gerd Baumann and Douglas H. Johnson (ed. and trans.), Juan Maria Schuver's Travels in North East Africa (London: The Hakluyt Society, 1996), p. 48 By the 1930s, Begi had become the seat of Sheikh Hojele, governor of Benishangul, and the major town of that region. Gold was reported to be found in the area. During the Italian occupation, the governor was Sheikh Abd al-Khair. The Oromo Liberation Front held their first national congress in Begi February, 1988, having taken control of much of the Ethiopian territory along the Sudan border.Ethiopia: A Country Study, \\"Other movements and Fronts\\", U.S. Library of Congress When the Benishangul-Gumuz and Oromia regions were established in 1992, the two regions disputed ownership of Begi, both wanting ownership. Benishangul-Gumuz's claim was based on two assertions: the first one was that Begi and its territory had been part of the domain of Sheikh Hojele; the second was that the earliest known inhabitants of the area were the Mao and Kwama peoples, which were ethnic groups assigned to Benishangul-Gumuz. To resolve this dispute, the Transitional Government of Ethiopia organized a referendum in 1994; the majority of voters decided in favor of joining Oromia, and Begi was placed under that region later that year.Asnake Kefale Adegehe, Federalism and ethnic conflict in Ethiopia: a comparative study of the Somali and Benishangul-Gumuz regions Department of Political Science, Faculty of Social and Behavioural Sciences, Leiden University, Doctoral thesis (2009), p. 225 On 18 October 2006, Begi and Gidami were the setting for clashes between Muslims and Protestant Christians, resulting in 9 deaths, including the death of two Protestant preachers, and over 100 injured.

All 87 crew and passengers died. It was caused by the disintegration of one of the turbine discs in one of the plane's engines, leading to uncontained engine failure. The turbine disc was later found to have manufacturing faults.  The aircraft and crew  LOT initiated their transatlantic routes in the early 1970s, for which it decided to purchase Ilyushin Il-62s. The aircraft which crashed was the first Il-62 that LOT had purchased for this purpose, manufactured in 1971. As with all Ilyushins purchased, it was named after a famous Polish historical figure, in this case the astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus (). All of the crew members of flight seven were Polish. The captain, Paweł Lipowczan, was 46 years old, with 8,770 flight hours' experience (4,385 of them on Ilyushin Il-62s). The first officer was Tadeusz Łochocki. The remaining flight crew were flight engineer Jan Łubniewski, flight navigator Konstanty Chorzewski and radio operator Stefan Wąsiewicz. There were five flight attendants on board.  Crash  On its final flight, the aircraft was piloted by Captain Lipowczan and First Officer Łochocki. Flight 7 was scheduled to depart from Kennedy International Airport at about 19:00 local time on 13 March 1980, but it was delayed because of a heavy snowstorm. It finally departed at 21:18, and after nine hours of an uneventful flight, it was approaching Okęcie Airport at 11:13 local time. During their final approach, about one minute before the landing, the crew reported to Okęcie Air Traffic Control that the landing gear indicator light was not operating, and that they would go around and allow the flight engineer to check if it was caused by a burnt-out fuse or light bulb, or if there was actually some problem with the gears deploying. (11:13:46) Okęcie Air Traffic Control: LOT 007, 5 degrees to the right. (11:13:52) Okęcie ATC: LOT 007? (11:13:54) LOT: Roger that... One moment, we have some problems with landing- gear-down-and-locked indicator, request a go-around. (11:13:57) Okęcie ATC: Roger, runway heading and altitude . [At that moment, \\"Kopernik\\" was at an altitude of .] (11:14:00) LOT: Runway heading and 650. This was the last transmission from Mikołaj Kopernik. Nine seconds later, the aircraft suddenly entered a steep dive. At 11:14:35, after 26 seconds of uncontrolled descent, the aircraft clipped a tree with its right wing and impacted the ice-covered moat of a 19th-century military fortress at a speed of approximately at a 20-degree down angle, away from the runway threshold and from a residential area. At the last moment Captain Lipowczan, using nothing but the plane's ailerons, managed to avoid hitting a correctional facility for teenagers located at Rozwojowa Street. On impact, the aircraft disintegrated; a large part of the main hull submerged in the moat, while the tail and parts of the main landing gear landed a few meters further, just before the entrance to the fort. On the scene, a diving team was later trying to recover parts of the aircraft (including some of the engines) from the moat, but it was far too murky; ultimately, the moat had to be drained to allow the air crash investigation team to recover parts of the disintegrated plane. The body of Captain Lipowczan was found lying on the street about from the crash site; other bodies were scattered between the plane parts. Graves of the crew at Powązki Military Cemetery, Warsaw. Among the 87 fatalities were Polish singer Anna Jantar, American ethnomusicologist Alan P. Merriam, six Polish students returning home from an AIESEC conference in New York, and a contingent of the U.S. amateur boxing team (who were scheduled for a series of exhibition fights in Europe instead of the boycotted Summer Olympics.) According to the doctors who arrived at the scene, many of the passengers were apparently asleep when the plane hit the ground, but some of them – including many of the boxers – were supposedly aware that they were about to crash, as they held to their seats so strongly that on impact, the muscles and tendons in their arms became severed. Some reports suggested that some of the boxers actually survived the crash and drowned in the moat, but no evidence for this was presented. A total of 22 U.S. boxers, trainers, and doctors died in the accident (including the 1979 Pan American Games winner light welterweight Lemuel Steeples), with the exception of a number of Olympic team members who were not present due to various pugilistic injuries sustained before the flight or to other reasons, which prevented their participation in the scheduled event, so they stayed in the United States and survived. Two of the boxers scheduled to fly on Flight 7, Bobby Czyz and Tony Tucker, later became world champions. At the time Mikołaj Kopernik crashed, a conference on improvements in air travel safety was being held at Okęcie airport, less than away. Ryszard Chmielewski, the flight engineer, was scheduled to fly to Warsaw on that day; because he suffered from jet lag and insufficient rest after the previous flight, he switched shifts with one of his colleagues and flew out of New York one day later. Seven years later, as a flight engineer and instructor, monitoring the progress of flight engineer Wojciech Kłossek, he was on board LOT Flight 5055, which crashed killing all 183 people on board. { - ccf;\\" !NationalityPassengersCrewTotal - valign=top Poland421052 - valign=top United States28028 - valign=top Soviet Union404 - valign=top East Germany303 - valign=top Total771087 }  Investigation  The police quickly surrounded the site and removed any spectators; recovery of airplane pieces started soon afterwards. Both the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder were found quickly; unfortunately, the recording suddenly stopped nine seconds after the last transmission, 26 seconds before the crash. While recovering the engines, the number-two (inner left) engine was found to be cut in half, held together only by the fuel lines. When the engine was further examined, the disc of the low-pressure turbine was found to be missing; despite an extensive search, it was not found at the crash site. Finally, the turbine disc was found about from the site; it was broken into three similar- sized pieces. After recovering the cockpit, the throttles of both engines 2 and 3 (inner right) were found to be shut off, while on engine 4 (outer right) the thrust was set to maximum. The investigating commission asked the Soviets if an Il-62 was able to reach the runway with one engine operating; no conclusive answer was received, but calculations based on the official technical data suggested that, while one engine thrust was insufficient for the aircraft to maintain altitude, it was enough to reach the runway and try to land. No explanation was found why the aircraft with one engine operating at maximum power suddenly entered a steep dive. Detailed analysis of the pieces of the turbine disc found several metallic impurities on the edges of two of them; in one case, they were identified as coming from the engine nacelle, in another, the impurities came from the nacelle, the hull, control actuators and finally, electrical cables. Also, detailed examination of the surface of the broken disc showed significant evidence of fatigue cracking.  Sequence of events  Finally, when the control pushers were found to be cut in half, it was proven that the cut was not caused by the crash, and some traces of the metal alloy the turbine disc was made of was found on the surface of the cut, the sequence of events became clear. The disaster started when Mikołaj Kopernik was instructed to climb to a higher flight level. When the necessary thrust was applied to all four engines, the low-pressure turbine of the number 2 engine disintegrated after 9 seconds. One piece of the turbine disc got ejected upwards, not causing any significant damage; the second piece shot into the engine number 1, damaging it seriously; finally, the third piece of the disc shot into the hull, severed the rudder and elevator control rods and destroyed the number 3 engine, causing loss of control over the plane; it also severed power cables for both the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder. This caused the last moments of Mikołaj Kopernik not to be recorded. The cut control rods also explained the sudden dive. When they were cut, the horizontal stabilizer, under its own weight, dropped down, causing the nose also to go down. This could be counteracted by the vertical trim; in Il-62s, the switch setting the vertical trim to manual operation was secured by a thin, sharp wire. On Captain Lipowczan's right hand, small wounds were found, and they were confirmed to be made while Lipowczan was still alive; supposedly, he ripped the security off and tried to control the vertical trim, but it was too late. In an interview for Polish TV series The Black Series, Captain Tomasz Smolicz, an experienced airline pilot who flew thousands of hours on transatlantic routes on Ilyushins Il-62 and Il-62M in the 1970s and 1980s (he flew Mikołaj Kopernik'\\" from Warsaw to New York on 13 March 1980), stated that the planes returning to Warsaw from the United States usually landed on runway course 150 (150 degrees, south-south-east), and if they landed at or before noon on a sunny day (such as on 14 March 1980), the sun was shining almost directly in their eyes, which were weary after several hours of night flight and constant monitoring of cockpit instruments; this sometimes caused disorientation and confusion if an indicator light actually was lit or not; so, on that day, the landing gear indicator could have actually been lit, but the crew members might have managed to see it incorrectly. During the recovery, the landing gear was found to be properly extended and locked.  Causes of disaster  According to the Polish government's Special Disaster Commission, the crash was caused by defects in materials, faults in the manufacturing process of the Kuznetsov NK-8 jet engine's shaft, and weaknesses in the design of its turbine. During the manufacturing of the low-pressure shaft, at a location where its section diameter increases, a sharp, 90-degree step was made, resulting in a sudden diameter change over a very short linear length - a classic condition for stress concentration, which results in fatigue cracking at that location. Additionally, the metallurgical analysis found that the shaft was incorrectly heat-treated during manufacture and contained contaminant particles such as non-metallic inclusions, which further reduced the shaft's ability to carry the torsional loads as designed. The improper machining and impurities facilitated an accelerated fatigue fracture of this key engine component via unmitigated formation of micro-cracks through the shaft's core, ultimately leading to its failure. Over time, the defects in Mikołaj Kopernik's shaft became large enough, and the shaft broke, resulting in the physical separation of the low-pressure turbine from the low-pressure compressor. As a result, the low-pressure turbine explosively disintegrated. Ejected with enormous force, pieces of the turbines damaged two further engines and cut through the hull. This caused the failure of the vertical and horizontal flight controls (rudder and elevator), and a catastrophic failure of numerous systems of the aircraft. The sudden loss of control of the flight control surfaces caused a steep, unrecoverable dive, and resulted in a crash, 26 seconds from the time of the original failure. A press article, released in Poland in 2010 and based on the review of archival documentation kept in IPN claimed that the People's Republic of Poland authorities contributed to the crash by demanding savings from LOT and excessive exploitation of engines. As a result of the economic policy of Edward Gierek in People's Republic of Poland in the second half of the 1970s it began raising prices, which started to drag the country into an economic crisis. In such circumstances, the Ministry of Transport required LOT to reduce costs. One of the first measures to reduce costs was to minimize refueling planes in foreign airports due to higher jet fuel prices. Aircraft were fueled in Poland to the maximum possible take-off weight. As a result, the crew used the full length of the runway. Conversely, they had a relatively small amount of fuel in reserve on the return flight, which sometimes forced them to land in bad weather. Flights with a maximal take off weight increased engine wear, since the engines were under greater load. NK-8-4 engines were not particularly reliable. Warranty service life was only 5,000 hours, and about half of LOT engines failed after 2000–3000 hours. Because of this, Polish pilots often called the Il-62 \\"flying coffins\\". In spite of the low reliability, the airline decided to increase overhaul life intervals to reduce the frequency of repairs, which were carried out in Soviet factories and quite expensive. LOT sent a letter to the Ilyushin Design Bureau containing the results of a test in which it was found that the engines could operate normally 8600 hours without maintenance. From the design bureau office came the answer that the Poles could fly as much as they want, but the manufacturer was responsible only for 5000 flight hours. Increased stress on the engines and lengthening of the service interval led to growth failure. There were cases when the IL-62 flew from the United States to Warsaw without passengers, on three engines. Representatives of the technical staff at the John F. Kennedy Airport reported two similar flights in the past two years. The most common causes of failure were bending or breaking of the blades. Consequently, there weren't enough serviceable engines. LOT fell into the practice of using three engines within the service interval, and a fourth beyond the interval. The investigation revealed the practice to be widespread. The airline called the fourth engines \\"leaders\\". Initially, Mikołaj Kopernik's engine 2 was installed on the aircraft SP-LAC Fryderyk Chopin, but after 1,700 hours of flying in 1975, the engine was removed due to damage of the low-pressure compressor's blade and sent for repair to Soviet Union. After repair the engine was placed on SP-LAB Tadeusz Kościuszko. After 5000 hours of flight, vibration was detected above the acceptable level and felt noticeably in the back of the aircraft. Therefore, in 1978 engine was again removed for repair in Poland and subsequently installed on SP-LAA Mikołaj Kopernik. After repair, the engine accumulated 700 flight hours before the accident. In spite of the vibrations, the defective engine was fitted to the aircraft, it being argued that the vibration level was \\"below acceptable standards.\\" Before the flight to New York the aircraft was checked by mechanic Zdzislaw Yarmonyakom, who found that the No.1 engine had a defect in one of the turbine blades. This deformation was located in the lowest (and widest) part of the blade. The mechanic wanted to report it, but found that the defect was already marked there, and the plane was subsequently allowed to fly. As he later explained to investigators, the mechanic decided that the defect was within tolerance. Engine No.3 had 8200 hours operating time without repair. The aircraft was allowed to fly to New York with three engines and only the No.4 engine was fully serviceable. The engine shaft's disintegration The Kuznetsov NK-8 is a two-spool turbofan engine with two low pressure turbines driving the fan and low pressure compressor and one high pressure turbine driving the higher stages of the compressor. As the No. 2 engine's low-pressure shaft failed, the low-pressure turbine suddenly separated from the low-pressure compressor, freeing itself. Because the engine combustion chamber was still producing power, the suddenly freed turbine spun out of control with such enormous speed that within a fraction of a second, the centrifugal force caused the turbine to disintegrate. The enclosure of the turbine failed to contain the pieces of the turbine, which were ejected tangentially at high speed, causing severe damage to the tail section of the aircraft.  Aftermath  The Polish government's Special Disaster Commission sent its findings on the cause of the accident to Moscow. In response, Russian engineers and scientists stated that the reasons given were implausible and that the turbine disintegrated because of engine failure, contrary to what was stated in the Polish report. (This could partially be attributed to a grudge Soviet engineers held against Poles, who purchased Ilyushin aircraft but replaced Ilyushin's own navigational systems with separately purchased, more modern American equipment.) Many years later it was revealed that after Flight 7's crash, all Il-62s used by Soviet officials and VIPs had their engines discreetly replaced with newer ones. At one occasion, a Polish governmental Il-62M had had specially installed newer engines for a joint Polish-Soviet governmental trip to Beijing; after that, the engines were taken back to the Soviet Union. The Polish commission report also called for some modernizations in the Il-62 design, most notably doubling the flight controls, so that if one system failed the plane would still be controllable. At the time, redundant controls of this kind were in general use in American and European-made airliners. This issue was never addressed by the Soviets; none of their Ilyushins of any type had installed alternate controls. Memorial to the Boxing victims A small statue dedicated to the boxers who perished in the accident – a trigonal prism made of bronze, with a knocked-out boxer statue at the top—is located at the grounds of Warsaw sport club Skra Warszawa. An identical statue is located at the United States Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs. The statues were funded by Thomas Kane of Printon Kane and Company and AIBA and designed by American sculptor Auldwin Thomas Schonberg. The graves of Mikołaj Kopernik's crew are located at the Powązki Military Cemetery in Warsaw. One of the streets adjacent to the crash site bears the name of Captain Paweł Lipowczan.

It flows about from its source, Gordons Peak in the Allegheny Mountains, to its confluence with the Little Calfpasture River, forming the Maury River. Via the Maury, the Calfpasture's waters flow into the James River, thence Chesapeake Bay and the Atlantic Ocean. According to the U.S. Board on Geographic Names, variant names of the Calfpasture River include the Big Calfpasture River, Calf Pasture River, Great Calfpasture River, and North River. Course The Calfpasture River originates on the slopes of Gordons Peak, in Augusta County, near Shenandoah Mountain, in George Washington National Forest. Its headwater tributaries drain Bald Ridge. The river flows generally southwest for most of its course. The tributary Braley Branch joins just before the Calfpasture River flows by the small settlement of West Augusta. U.S. Route 250 crosses the river at West Augusta. Continuing southwest, the river is joined by West Dry Branch from the east, then it enters Deerfield Valley, where the tributaries Tizzle Branch and Still Run join. Deerfield Valley is flanked by Shenandoah Mountain to the west and Great North Mountain to the east. The Calfpasture River flows by the small town of Little Baltimore, after which one of its main tributaries, Hamilton Branch, joins. The Calfpasture River then flows out of Deerfield Valley and through Fridley Cove, where Fridley Branch joins. Below Fridley Cove, the Calfpasture River continues flowing southwest, through the valley between Walker Mountain to the west and Great North Mountain to the east. The river passes the small town of Marble Valley, then Clayton Mill Creek joins, after which the river leaves Augusta County and enters Rockbridge County. Near the town of Goshen the Calfpasture River is joined by Mill Creek from the west and Goshen Branch from the east. State Route 42 crosses the river at Goshen, and State Route 39 follows the river from Goshen downstream to the Maury River. Just south of Goshen the tributary Brattons Run joins the Calfpasture River, which then turns eastward, passing through a gap between Bratton Mountain and Knob Mountain. The Calfpasture River then joins the Little Calfpasture River.

The natural history of this frog is poorly understood, with most of it coming from behaviors and habits observed during the spring when they gather in vernal pools to breed. One study has found that during the summer, the frogs take shelter inside remote limestone caves, and showed a strong preference for caves which harbored colonies of bats. This is most likely because they could eat the insects that proliferated in the bat's guano. References * Dinets, V. Trogloxeny in the Caucasian parsley frog (Pelodytes caucasicus).

This species is only found in Portugal and Spain; in Spanish it is known as sapillo moteado ibérico. Description Adult Iberian parsley frogs attain a length of about and look very similar to the common parsley frog (Pelodytes punctatus, its sister species) but are a little smaller with shorter limbs. The skin is smooth or granular with a scattering of dark-coloured tubercles. The dorsal surface varies from olive, greenish-brown, dark brown or greenish- grey and is flecked with green specks. The undersurface is white or cream and the throat of breeding males is dark-coloured. Distribution and habitat The Iberian parsley frog is endemic to the Iberian Peninsula. It is quite common in suitable habitats in Spain but seems to be rare in Portugal. It occurs in open areas, under bushes, among scattered trees, in salt marshes, fields and gardens. It can continue to live in intensively farmed areas. Breeding Breeding takes place in the spring, often after heavy rain. Eggs are laid in ponds, ditches, slow-moving streams and flooded areas. Egg masses contain up to 350 eggs and several clutches may be laid over the course of a few days. The eggs hatch after about a fortnight and the tadpoles may take about three months to develop before undergoing metamorphosis into juvenile frogs. Conservation status This frog has a wide range and the overall population seems to be reasonably stable. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) rates it as being of \\"Least Concern\\" as it considers that the rate of decline, if any, is insufficient to justify listing it in a more threatened category. This frog is common over much of its range and the threats it faces have been identified as degradation of its habitat, the loss of its breeding pools, and the predation of the invasive freshwater crayfish Procambarus clarkii.

He was a son of Gotfrid and brother and co-ruler with Lantfrid from 709. In 727, Theudebald expelled Pirmin, the founder of Reichenau Abbey, out of a hatred for Charles Martel (ob odium Karoli), whose influence in Alamannia he detested. During a military campaign in 730, Lantfrid was killed and Theudebald became sole duke. In 732, Theudebald was chased out of Alemannia by Charles Martel, but upon Charles' death in 741 he returned to claim his dukedom. In 742, Theudebald rebelled against the nominal authority of the Merovingian monarchy which was then being exercised by the two mayors of the palace Pepin the Short and Carloman; the Basques, Bavarii, and Saxons all revolted simultaneously. That same year Theudebald invaded the Duchy of Alsace, then ruled by Duke Liutfrid. The Alsatian duke was probably killed alongside his son fighting for the mayors. In 744, Pepin invaded the Swabian Jura and chased Theudebald from his mountain redoubt. He was defeated in Alsace by Pepin's select band of warriors. In 745, Carloman had to march on the duke again, this time defeating him and executing many at the blood court of Cannstatt. Alamannia was subjected once and for all. Its subsequent history was much affected by the violence with which its ducal independence was snuffed out. Sources *Reuter, Timothy. Germany in the Early Middle Ages 800-1056\\\\.

It is about Mitchie (Demi Lovato), a young girl aspiring to be a singer, and her time at Camp Rock, a summer music camp, where she will discover friends, adversaries, romance, and her voice. The film premiered on Disney Channel on June 20, 2008. Camp Rock was the second DCOM to air on ABC's The Wonderful World of Disney after its premiere on Disney Channel and was placed on the iTunes Store for digital purchase shortly after its premiere. The film was watched by 8.9 million viewers on the night of its premiere and is currently the third highest viewed DCOM of all time, behind High School Musical 2 and Wizards of Waverly Place: The Movie.Jonas Brothers' TV Movie Nabs 8.9 Million Viewers. (June 21, 2008) US Magazine. Accessed 2008-11-11. The film was followed by a sequel, Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam (2010). Plot Mitchie Torres (Demi Lovato) is a young musician aspiring to be a singer. She wants to go to a summer music camp named \\"Camp Rock\\". Since her family cannot afford the tuition, Mitchie's mother, Connie Torres (Maria Canals-Barrera), arranges to cater food for the camp, thus allowing Mitchie to attend. In return, Mitchie must help her mother in the kitchen. Shortly after arriving at camp, Mitchie meets a girl named Caitlyn (Alyson Stoner). Meanwhile, Shane Gray (Joe Jonas), the spoiled and arrogant lead singer of the popular music trio Connect 3, is assigned to be in charge of dance classes at Camp Rock by his bandmates Nate Gray (Nick Jonas) and Jason Gray (Kevin Jonas) and is forced to record a song with the winner of Final Jam. Shane overhears Mitchie singing and falls in love with her voice, but Mitchie leaves before Shane can figure out it was her, causing him to obsess over finding the mysterious singer. During Opening Jam, Mitchie learns that many of the campers have notable roots and is embarrassed that she was only able to come to the camp because of her mother's catering service. She lies to Tess Tyler (Meaghan Martin), a girl known for her famous mother and her popularity, and her friends, Peggy (Jasmine Richards) and Ella (Anna Maria Perez de Tagle), that her mother is the president of Hot Tunes TV China. Tess, impressed, invites Mitchie to bunk with her group. One day, during lunch in the cafeteria, Tess and Caitlyn begin to throw spaghetti at each other and Mitchie gets in the middle of the fight. Brown (Daniel Fathers), the owner of the camp, breaks up the fight, and Tess frames Caitlyn for the incident. Brown punishes Caitlyn by making her work in the kitchen and Mitchie, who is worried that Caitlyn will learn about her secret, does not defend her. Meanwhile, Shane writes a new song, which he shares with Mitchie. Mitchie likes the song, and Shane, doubtful that his record label and his fans would accept the song, begins to fall for her. Later, Catilyn arrives in the kitchen while Mitchie is working and learns about Mitchie's secret. Catilyn calls Mitchie's keeping her identity as the cook's daughter a secret immature, and Mitchie in turn insults Catilyn's attitude. However, the two girls reconcile after Mitchie stands up to Tess when Tess attempts to upstage Catilyn at Pajama Jam. Shane spreads the word that he is searching for a girl with \\"the voice\\". When Tess sees Mitchie and Shane rowing together, she becomes jealous and, after finding out about Mitchie's secret, forces her to tell the entire camp the truth. Shane, infuriated that Mitchie deceived him to get close to him just because he is famous, ditches her. Tess kicks Mitchie, who is now a laughingstock throughout the camp, out of her group. Tess later learns that Mitchie is the girl Shane had been looking for. In order to get rid of Mitchie, on the eve of Final Jam, Tess frames Mitchie and Caitlyn for stealing her charm bracelet. When the girls cannot prove their innocence, Brown bans them from all camp activities until the end of Final Jam. At Final Jam, Brown announces that the winner, as decided by the judges, Connect 3, will not only win a trophy, but get to record with Shane. Peggy and Ella lose their patience with Tess, stand their ground and leave her group. Ella performs \\"Hasta La Vista\\" with Barron (Jordan Francis) and Sander (Roshon Fegan). Tess realizes that her mom is watching and starts to perform \\"2 Stars\\". Unfortunately, when her mom has to take a call during her performance, she stumbles in front of the audience and retreats backstage in tears. Peggy reveals her real name is Margaret Dupree and performs \\"Here I Am\\". Tess apologizes to Peggy and Ella. As Brown announces the end of Final Jam, the spotlights turn on, and he allows Mitchie to perform, saying he was hoping she and Catilyn would catch on: as their performance was not in the lineup and was technically after \\"the end of Final Jam\\". Mitchie begins to sing \\"This Is Me\\". Shane realizes that she was the voice from before, and he soon joins in. Backstage, Tess tells Mitchie and Caitlyn she told Brown that they didn't steal her bracelet, and Mitchie and Shane reconcile. Peggy is announced as the winner of Final Jam. After she's crowned winner, the entire camp sing \\"We Rock\\". In an extended ending of the film, a few months later, Caitlyn shows Mitchie, Tess, Peggy, and Ella the recording studio that she built in her garage, and they perform \\"Our Time Is Here\\".

Pre-race Two Nextel Cup Series teams announced changes in their ownership just before this race: *Dale Earnhardt Inc. merged with Ginn Racing, taking over the No. 01 team of Mark Martin and Aric Almirola, and closing the Nos. 13 and 14 teams after Ginn had released Joe Nemechek and Sterling Marlin because of sponsorship difficulties. The No. 14 and No. 15 teams switched positions in the standings, guaranteeing Paul Menard, the driver of the No. 15, a starting spot. Regan Smith, who had shared driving duties with Martin, was reassigned to the Craftsman Truck Series. * Terry Labonte filled in for Michael Waltrip in the No. 55 Toyota which originally made Bill Elliott, winner of the 2002 race, and his No. 21 Wood Brothers/JTG Racing team ineligible for the past champion's provisional since Labonte's championship is more recent than Elliott's. However, with the closing of the Nos. 13 and 14 teams from Ginn, Elliott was assured of racing in this event. * Originally, there were 51 cars on the initial entry list, including the No. 13 team, which was left without a driver and sponsor. The No. 14 team was entered with Smith as the driver, but because of the merger between DEI and Ginn Racing, the final entry list only included 49 cars. Race Results {  - ! Pos. ! No. ! Driver !

This time, the 400 was originally scheduled to air on ESPN, while ABC would not takeover the broadcast until September. Additionally, this was the first NASCAR Cup race aired on ESPN since the 2000 season finale of what was then the Winston Cup Series. *Dale Jarrett's failure to qualify meant that only 4 drivers had started every Brickyard 400 since its inception in 1994: Jeff Gordon, Bobby Labonte, Mark Martin, and Bill Elliott. *Kevin Harvick, who led part of the race until Stewart overtook him on lap 149, missed the victory by a close finish to become the 3rd driver to win the Daytona 500 and the Brickyard 400 in the same year. Post-race For the second time since 2004, a winning driver uttered an obscenity in a live post- race interview when Stewart said \\"This one's for every one of those fans in the stands who pull for me every week and take all the bullshit from everybody else\\" to then ESPN pit reporter Dave Burns. At first, it was perceived to be in response to critics who have gone after his blunt and abrasive personality, but it has since been reported that Stewart was the subject of statements made by Pardon the Interruption co-hosts Tony Kornheiser and Michael Wilbon on the show that aired the day after Stewart's win at the USG Sheetrock 400. After Stewart joked about celebrating the victory by drinking a case of Schlitz beer, the co-hosts concluded that the driver was a bad role model for children. Whether the comments were a form of revenge against the network is open for interpretation.Tony Stewart Punk'd ESPN...Tony Stewart vs. ESPN: It Could Be a Long TV Season On the Tuesday after the race, Stewart was fined by NASCAR, and lost 25 points in the driver's championship due to the infraction. His team, Joe Gibbs Racing, also was penalized 25 points in the owners' championship. However, his classification of fifth in the championship standings remained the same despite the penalty.ESPN - Stewart fined $25,000, docked 25 points for cursing on TV - Nascar Dale Earnhardt Jr., who said the word \\"shit\\" after winning the 2004 EA Sports 500 at Talladega Superspeedway had been given the same penalty that year.

Rosen, James R. Teter, William H. Broadley, J. Stanley Kriz, D. Raj Reddy and Paul G. Newbury in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States to manufacture advanced technology computer displays, peripherals, and systems. Early products included: the GDP/2A Graphics Display processor with high speed vector generator capable of drawing in excess of 50,000 vectors at 60 Hz refresh rates; a CVD/2 Color Video Display System that displayed a full color raster scanned image with a unique data compression algorithm capable of full frame animation display; ADA-16 Analog to Digital and Digital to Analog converters for high fidelity music and speech research, and a UMB-11 Unibus Monitor that was a low-cost test instrument for PDP-11 series minicomputers. In 1979, the company launched its principal products, a line of workstation computers called PERQ, which were single-user high performance workstations with the power of a medium- scale mainframe computer from that era coupled with a versatile graphics display. In the summer of 1980, the company divested itself of all activities other than those related to PERQ. From 1981 onwards, 3RCC developed and produced the PERQ jointly with ICL in the United Kingdom. 3RCC changed its name to PERQ Systems Corporation in 1984, but became insolvent in 1985.

Their name was derived from a song by The Trashmen. The band was formed in 1984 by vocalist Billy Miller and his wife, drummer and co-vocalist Miriam Linna, in the wake of a prior band collaboration, The Zantees. The couple were at the time editors of the rock and roll culture fanzine Kicks and on the threshold of launching Norton Records. Guitarist Bruce Bennett replaced original guitarist Mike Mariconda shortly after the band was formed. Marcus \\"The Carcass\\" Natale replaced founding bass player Mike Lewis (a one time member of both the Lyres and Yo La Tengo), prior to recording the A-Bones second E.P. Free Beer For Life in 1988 and as well contributed original songs with other members . Tenor sax player Lars Espensen further filled out the group from 1990 until 2010. The New York Times described the band solely in terms of its label, calling the group \\"dedicated rock revivalists\\", and noting \\"The A-Bones include Miriam Linna and Billy Miller, proprietors of Norton Records, which worships rockabilly, 1960s garage and anything having to do with that most cartoonish rock archetype: the juvenile delinquent in a leather jacket.\\"Sisario, Ben. \\"Ring Out, Ring In, And You Can Choose the Beat\\", The New York Times, December 29, 2006.

The series premiered in Japan on October 7, 2006 and finished its run on October 27, 2007. The English version premiered on Toonami Jetstream on July 23, 2007. On August 25, the series then premiered on Cartoon Network edited as a 2-hour faux-movie presentation composed of Japanese episodes 1 through 9 and heavily slimmed-down versions of episodes 12, 15, and 16. Currently, it is unknown when or if the series will air in normal episodic format on television, but subsequent episode airings online reveal that the unusual edits are exclusive to the television premiere. The original Japanese episodes are roughly 10 minutes long, with the English version combining two episodes together to fill a single 30-minute time-slot. Although most of the plots in the Japanese version are already split between two 10-minute episodes, a few one-part and three-part plots disrupt what would otherwise be a seamless combination of episodes. Thus, many English-dubbed episodes begin with the conclusion of the previous episode and end with a cliffhanger. Either way, this is problematic, as the series ends on an odd number of episodes. In order to compensate, Viz has combined Japanese episode 25 with ten minutes of recycled footage from the previous 25 episodes. This footage acts as a recap of the story up to that point and is accompanied with narration by Geo Stelar. The series loosely follows the events of the first Nintendo DS Mega Man Star Force video game. However, the storyline makes an obvious shift at Japanese episode 32 using many concepts not featured in the games, specifically, the FM-ians' quest to gather \\"minus energy\\" and their ability to transform into doppelgänger forms of the humans they once possessed. This implied that the series was in a state of filler plot-lines until the second video game was released. The majority of the run was handled by three art directors, although near the end, two more art directors appeared. The art directors mostly worked independently of one another one individual episodes, although in a few instances shared episodes. They are: * Masayuki Nomoto - Japanese episodes 1-2, 5-7, 10, 13-14, 19-21, 24-25, 28-29, 32-34, 36-37, 40-41, 44-45, 48-51 * Akira Takahashi - Japanese episodes 3-4, 8-9, 12, 15-17, 22, 30-31, 35, 42-43, 46-47 * Shingo Adachi - Japanese episodes 11, 18, 23, 26-27, 38-39, 43, 46-47, 52 * Sunao Chikaoka - Japanese episode 53 * Yasuo Shimizu - Japanese episodes 54-55 The episodes below are listed separately according to their Japanese broadcast. Once the English versions have aired, they are then combined into a single episode to correspond with the English version.

He is known in his home country as Yuyo. In 1961 he formed Otra Figuración (another figuration) with three other Argentine artists. Their eponymous exhibition and subsequent work greatly influenced the Neofiguration (Neo-figuration, New figuration) movement. After the group disbanded, Noé relocated to New York City where he painted and showed assemblages that stretched the boundaries of the canvas. In 1965 he published his groundbreaking theoretical work, Antiestética. He then took a ten-year hiatus from painting and upon return to Buenos Aires opened a bar, taught, wrote and created installations with mirrors. A military coup coincided with his painting comeback, and in 1976 Noé migrated to Paris where he continued to experiment, both with canvas re-texturing and the drawing process. His later paintings move away from the figure and focus on elements of landscape. Noé currently lives and works in Buenos Aires. His son, Gaspar Noé is a Franco- Argentine filmmaker. Education Luis Felipe Noé studied painting with Horacio Butler from 1950 to 1952 but is “essentially considered self- taught.”Ramirez, Mari Carmen. Re-Aligning Vision: Alternative Currents in South American Drawing. Austin: Archer M. Huntington Art Gallery, The University of Texas at Austin, 1997. He also studied law at the Universidad de Buenos Aires and wrote art reviews for various newspapers prior to his first exhibit in 1959 at the Galeria Witcomb. Career Otra Figuración (1960−1965) Painting In 1960 the artists of Otra Figuración began to live and work together in an apartment building that doubled as a studio in Carlos Pellegrini Street in Buenos Aires.Grieder, Terence. Argentina’s New Figurative Art. Art Journal Vol. 24, No. 1 (Autumn 1964) pp. 2-6 The collective included Rómulo Macció, Ernesto Deira, Jorge de la Vega, Luis Felipe Noé and for a short while, Antonio Seguí who exhibited briefly with the group but is not generally considered a member of Otra Figuración since his style quickly diverged. The “violent, disturbing”Glusberg, Jorge. Art In Argentina. Milan: Giancarlo Politi Editore, 1986. work that emerged from the group’s first exhibition at the Galeria Peuser in 1961, also titled Otra Figuración “reflected a nation whose history and everyday life were so marked by violent occurrences.”Sullivan, Edward J. Latin American Art in the Twentieth Century. London: Phaidon Press Limited, 1996. His two seminal paintings from this period are Introduccion a la esperanza (Introduction to Hope) and Cerrado por brujería (Closed for Sorcery), both from 1963. Esperanza won the prestigious Premio Palanza given by the Instituto Torcuato Di Tella in 1963. The painting depicts an amorphous, riotous mass of open-mouthed figures proferring signs that read “Champion, do not leave us,” and “Vote for blind force,” while additional signs set on plywood stems sprout from the top of the canvas and display portraits of political candidates. The work embodies nine separate canvases, communicating a sense of the overwhelming anarchy and continual unrest that defines Argentina’s political process. The crowd forms one massive animal that blindly jostles and lobbies for some low level of survival, complicit in elevating the oppressors who cynically grin and bob far above them. In contrast, Cerrado depicts the people not as an indistinguishable mass but as individual grimacing visages trapped within a grid of boxes. The cloaked figure of a sorcerer looms above, nullified by a crucifix, surrounded by ferocious, fantasy animals. The iconography and structure of the painting suggest ideological incoherency and social chaos, belief systems or regimes continually supplanting one another and in flux while the citizens remain caged. Drawing An exhibition composed exclusively of drawings by the group in 1962, titled Esto at Galeria Lirolay in Buenos Aires had a significant impact on autonomous, experimental drawing in Latin American art. Otra Figuración emphasized process over technique. They influenced contemporaries Alberto Heredia, Cildo Meireles, Rubens Gerchman and Antonio Dias among others. The exhibit emerged from the political climate in 1962, one Noé likened to “social dislocation” and then linked to the “structural dislocation” apparent in the drawings. With the president of Argentina deposed by the military, Buenos Aires was once again in chaos and facing civil war. Emblematic of the exhibit, Noé’s Sin titulo (Untitled) uses black India ink on pulp to create an artwork defaced with random slashes and blots, featuring rotund, distorted figures gathered around a black exploding center. Although the work appears to contain surreal elements, it’s a true, psychological and emotional expression of Argentina’s then current and seemingly perpetual social and political disorder. Otra Figuración was officially discontinued in 1963, although the group continued to exhibit together until 1965. New York (1965−1966) Following Otra Figuración disbanding in 1965, that same year Noé received a Guggenheim fellowship that allowed him to relocate to New York City. He pushed his ideas regarding chaos even further at this time, creating huge, unsaleable and difficult-to-store assemblages—even throwing his work into the Hudson River.Glusberg, Jorge. “Noé, Luis Felipe.” The Dictionary of Art, Ed. Jane Turner. New York: Grove’s Dictionaries Inc., 1996. He also published Antiestética in 1965, a text explicating his theories on chaos, “the purpose of anti-aesthetics today is to split the concept of unity.” In the introduction to the 1966 exhibition brochure at Bonino Gallery in New York City, Noé revised an earlier opinion on the fusion of figures, reflecting the contradictions in both Argentina and Latin America, writing that “the essential element of contemporary society is the tension and opposition among diverging cosmovisions, the fraternizations of opposing atmospheres.”Noé, Luis Felipe. “Solemn Letter to Myself: December 1965.” Galeria Bonino, New York, N.Y. Exhibition Brochure, 1966. The paintings in the show were prefigured by his 1962 work, Mambo, a deconstructed painting that featured the front and back of the work, an “inverted painting...hinting at another side of painting...abandoning neo-figurative painting.” The 1966 Bonino Gallery exhibition included Three doors: distorted, haunted faces painted as isolated fragments on old, hinged-together panel doors—some with missing or broken panels, and also the huge, ironically titled Balance. This assemblage consisted of several large canvases, some lying on the floor, others propped precariously against each other or along walls, some with sections popped out and up from the canvas, displayed like fragile paper dolls on a stand. His attempt to order chaos had led to “pictures of broken vision.” After this exhibition, Noé returned to Buenos Aires and stopped painting entirely for almost ten years. The sabbatical is attributed to a combination of existential crisis and commercial failure. Buenos Aires (1967−1976) Upon return to Buenos Aires, Noé opened a bar (Barbaro) that was frequented by the literati. Even though he’d temporarily abandoned painting, his creative impulse never abated. Noé taught during these years and continued to innovate spatially, using distortion mirrors to arrange installations which he exhibited at the Museo de Bellas Artes de Caracas in 1968. The mirrors helped him to visualize the characters in his 1974 experimental novel Recontrapoder, a philosophical exploration of fragmentation, absurdity, power and aethestics. For Noé, life in Buenos Aires was absurd. Restoration of order meant empowering a repressive government, while protest resulted in riots and endless social upheaval. Ironically, one of the worst political crises in Argentina’s history coincided with his return to painting. He said during the 1975 exhibition, \\"I feel...like a mirror facing both the ghost of a dead person and the future latency of an unborn.\\" Strife had escalated since the late 1960s, adding to Buenos Aires’ usual instability. Radicals, ex-Peronists, writers and intellectuals joined urban guerillas, creating even further havoc.Wilson, Jason. Buenos Aires: A Cultural History. Northampton: Interlink Books, 2007. Strikes, riots and economic collapse followed. The chaotic situation turned dire in 1974 when Isabel Perón took power and street fighting between right-wing death squads and guerillas surged. Bombings and atrocities became routine; riots were used as an excuse for military brutality and takeover. The coup in 1976 resulted in an estimated 9,000-30,000 “disappeared.” Noé went into exile, relocating to Paris. Paris (1976−1987) Noé’s art continued to evolve in Paris. Once again, he altered the frame of reference by re-texturizing huge pieces of canvas before painting, “crumpling and gathering, then stapling to the stretcher...creating a tortured surface for paint..”Buccellato, Laura and Costa, Eduardo. Luis F. Noé at Centro Cultural Borges and Galeria Rubbers. Art in America v87n3 (Mar 1999) pp. 126-127. He also began painting expressive landscapes that reflected both internal and external turbulence, such as The Storm in 1982. He experimented further with drawing technique in Paris, creating a “progressive, narrative transformation of the original image” by using a Xerox to copy multiple redrawn versions of an original. Works such as One Passion and Four Transformations were considered a return to Otra Figuración’s platform, “drawing as process rather than mimesis and formal idealization.” Later work (1987−1997) Noé returned, as always, to Buenos Aires in 1987 and continued to work with oversized canvases and landscape elements. His 1997 exhibition at Centro Cultural Borges and Galeria Rubbers in Buenos Aires consisted of a total of 60 canvases, all painted in 1997. Noé introduced a new visual element in this show, \\"violently colored stripes...to energize his landscapes.\\" He also repeated the crumpled canvas technique developed in the 1980s to great effect in the painting Ominoso, a field of blue sporting streamers of crushed and painted canvas. Artistry Stylistic hallmarks of Otra Figuración’s version of Neofiguration are strong, vivid colors and spontaneous, slashing brushwork; fusion of fragmented and distorted figures with each other and animals; political content; extreme sense of kinesis and the appearance of anarchy on canvas. Structurally, the group made use of collage, mixed media, oversized canvases, and assemblages that gave many of the works a sculptural quality. Overall, the artwork managed to merge form, content, process and philosophy. The philosophical platform of the group and its art are best expressed by Noé, “I believe in chaos as a value.”Ramirez, Mari Carmen and Olea, Hector. Inverted Utopias: Avant-Garde Art in Latin America. New Haven & London: Yale University Press, 2004. He doesn’t demonize chaos but acknowledges and accepts the reality of its inescapable existence. The group’s art reflects the political instability and uncertainty of life in Buenos Aires and also, in a larger sense, an awareness of the precarious situation of all human beings living in the incoherent modern world. Noé proposed that in such a world, chaos itself must become an organizing principle.Frank, Patrick. Readings in Latin American Modern Art. “Chaos as a Structure, from Antiestética, 1965.” Noe, Luis Felipe. New Haven & London: Yale University Press, 2004. Noé embraces both political and human chaos in his work, fearlessly entering the eye of the storm. Influences Informalism was the predominant movement in Argentina at the time, and Noé’s influences were the painters Sarah Grilo and José Antonio Fernández- Muro.Barnitz, Jacqueline. Twentieth-Century Art of Latin America. Austin: University of Texas Press, 2001 Other acknowledged Argentine influences on both Noé and his fellow-artists who later comprised Otra Figuración, were the politically oriented neo-figurist Antonio Berni and the Boa group. The Europeans collectively known as Cobra, as well as Antonio Saura, Francis Bacon, Willem de Kooning and Jean Dubuffet may also have inspired the artists of Otra Figuración and are often referred to as comparable contemporaries in certain respects (de Kooning’s brushwork for instance), although they obviously differ in others. Awards and honours Noé was honored with a retrospective in 1995/1996 at the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes in Buenos Aires and the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City. In 2002 Konex Foundation from Argentina, granted him the Diamond Konex Award for Visual Arts as the most important artist in the last decade in his country.

It is endemic to central Chile, although it might well be extinct. Description The Chile Darwin's frog has a snout to vent length of about . It has a fleshy proboscis, slender limbs and feet webbed between the first and second, and the second and third toes. The dorsal colour is variable but is usually some shade of brown or green, or a mixture of the two. The ventral surface is mottled in black and white. Biology The Chile Darwin's frog is diurnal and feeds on small insects and other invertebrates. The female lays a small clutch of eggs on moist ground. About a week later the embryos are beginning to move within the eggs and the male picks them up and stores them in his vocal sac. He keeps them there until they have developed a functioning gut and then transports them to a suitable water body and releases them. The tadpoles grow further in the water and undergo metamorphosis there. This development is in contrast to that of the Darwin's frog (Rhinoderma darwinii) tadpoles which complete their development in their parent's vocal sac. Distribution and habitat The Chile Darwin's frog has a very restricted range in central Chile, being found in Talca Province and southwards to Bío Bío Province, between from 33° 30'S to 37° 50'S. Very little is known about this species, but its natural habitats are probably temperate forests, rivers and swamps. It has been found in wet beech forests at altitudes of between above sea level. The species was sympatric with Rhinoderma darwinii in the region surrounding Concepcion, near the southern extremities of Rhinoderma rufum's distribution. Conservation status The Chile Darwin's frog is currently listed as \\"Critically Endangered\\" by the IUCN, but as there have been no confirmed sightings since around 1981, it may already be extinct. The main threats it faces are destruction of the pine forests in which it lives and building work but its steep decline is unexplained. It may be the victim of disease such as chytridiomycosis but this had not been reported in Chile when the decline started.EDGE Amphibians: World's Weirdest Creatures Just Got Weirder by Science daily.

It is 3.8 to 6.3 cm long and is usually colored gray, olive or brown. Great Basin spadefoot toads have adapted to life in dry habitats. They use the hard, keratinized spade on each foot to dig a burrow, where they spend long periods during cold and dry weather. They are opportunistic hunters and will eat anything they can subdue. While their tadpoles have numerous predators, adults are able to produce skin secretions that deter enemies.  Identification  The Great Basin spadefoot ranges from 3.8 to 6.3 cm long. It is usually gray, olive or brown colored. Gray streaks outline an hourglass shaped marking on the back. The skin is smooth compared with the bumpy skin of the true toads in the genus Bufo. There is a spade present on the inside of each hind foot; it has sharp edges and is wedge- shaped. A glandular boss is present between the eyes. Eyes are catlike; pupils are vertical in bright light and round at night. Dark brown spots are present on each upper eyelid.  Habitat and distribution  The natural habitats of the Great Basin spadefoot include pinyon-juniper, ponderosa pine, and high elevation (up to 2,600 m) spruce-fir forests, semidesert shrubland, sagebrush flats, temperate grasslands, and deserts. They are present in agricultural areas as well. The Great Basin Spadefoot can be found from southern British Columbia through the eastern portions of Washington and Oregon and in southern Idaho. Their range extends throughout all of Nevada and into most of Utah; they are also present in small areas in California, Arizona, Colorado, and Wyoming.  Reproduction  Breeding Breeding is explosive, meaning that large congregations of individuals assemble and mate with each other. Adults are terrestrial and must migrate to breeding sites. Breeding may take place in permanent or temporary water sources such as springs, sluggish streams, and manmade reservoirs during the months of April through July. Spring rains usually provide the stimulus for males to emerge from their burrows for breeding, although unlike other spadefoots (Scaphiopus spp.), Great Basin spadefoots do breed during periods of no rainfall. The stimulus for breeding in the absence of rain is unknown. Males move to breeding waters first and begin vocalizing. Once females arrive, there is a race to mate with as many others as possible, and physical contests between males are common. Females usually lay 300–500 eggs contained in a sticky gel, but have been reported lay as many as 1000 eggs in captivity. The female deposits her fertilized eggs in several different locations within the breeding water: on vegetation, rocks, bottom of the pool, or anything else that anchors the eggs. After mating, females return to their burrows. Males stay at the breeding pool and continue vocalizing until females stop arriving (presumably because all females in the vicinity have mated); then the males also return to their burrows. Development Eggs hatch in 2 to 4 days, and the tadpole development and metamorphosis is complete within 4 to 8 weeks, depending upon temperature, food quality, and food quantity. Developing rapidly helps Great Basin spadefoots avoid desiccation and consequent death in their arid environment. Young morphs (metamorphosed preadults) are small, about 0.8 inch (19 mm) in length on average. They have high surface-to-volume ratios; therefore, they are highly susceptible to desiccation and seek shade cover immediately after emerging from breeding pools. They grow, by about 110% in length and 1,100% in mass over 3 months under laboratory conditions. Tadpoles may be carnivorous or herbivorous, depending on environmental conditions. Different larval diets are associated with different morphological characteristics.  Behavior   Diet  Adult spadefoots are opportunistic carnivores. Adults have been shown to eat arthropods from the taxa Coleoptera, Diptera, Hemiptera, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, Neuroptera, Orthoptera, Trichoptera, Collembola, and Araneae. Ants and beetles are their most common prey. Feeding seems to be generalized and opportunistic; the toads will eat anything they can subdue. Adults hunt in spring and summer, but only at night or during light rains. Spadefoot tadpoles are dimorphic. Within a cohort, some tadpoles have large mouthparts, while others have much smaller mouthparts. As well as consuming other types of food, large-mouthed individuals are cannibalistic, swallowing other tadpoles whole.  Defense mechanisms  Reported predators of adult Great Basin Spadefoot toads include rattlesnakes, coyotes, and owls. Predators of larva include mud turtles (Kinosternon flavescens), spotted skunks (Spilogale putarius), raccoons (Procyon lotor), common crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos) and snakes. Adults are able to produce skin secretions that cause allergic reactions in some humans, including a burning sensation if the secretion gets in the eyes or nose. The skin secretions also deter predators.  Burrowing behavior  Great Basin spadefoot toads have adapted to life in dry habitats. Desiccation is avoided by this terrestrial amphibian through burrowing into the ground. The toad use the hard, keratinized spade on each foot to dig a burrow, where it spends long periods during cold and dry weather. The toad is able to absorb water from the surrounding soil; even as the soil becomes increasingly dry in spring and early summer months, increased concentrations of urea in the toad's body allow it to continue to suck water out of the soil through osmosis. When the summer rains arrive the Great Basin spadefoot emerges from its burrow. Morphs and adult Great Basin spadefoots normally venture from their burrows at night, when it is rainy or the night air is humid enough for dew to collect. Captive spadefoots have been observed to dig shallow burrows in moist soil, then dig deeper (2 to 3 feet [0.7–1.2 m]) as soil dries at the surface. Spadefoots have been found 15 feet (4.6 m) underground in natural conditions. An individual spadefoot digs and occupies only one burrow, which it usually returns to after foraging or mating. Spadefoots do not use shrubs or other vegetation for cover while foraging. Spadefoots accumulate fat rapidly in summer. They are dormant in fall and winter, with dormancy apparently triggered by photoperiod. Spring emergence may be triggered by increased moisture in the burrow. Spadefoots extend their dormancy period during drought, and can apparently remain dormant or mostly dormant for long periods of time. Fat reserves are metabolized slowly during dormancy, and females may reabsorb their eggs if spring rains do not occur. References Further reading * Maxymiv, N.

Established in 1901, by U.S. Ambassador Bartlett Tripp and U.S. Senator Thomas Sterling. The law school is home to approximately 168 students and has more than 3,000 alumni. With 168 J.D. candidates, it is currently the second-smallest law school and smallest public law school student population among the American Bar Association accredited law schools. The University of South Dakota School of Law has produced eight Governors of South Dakota including as well as other key figures important to the development of the state, nearly the historical entirety of the South Dakota Supreme Court and U.S. District Court for the District of South Dakota, thirteen members of the U.S. Congress, nineteen Attorney Generals of South Dakota, and thirteen U.S. Attorneys for the District of South Dakota, earning it the nickname \\"the Alma Mater of the State.\\" History 1901-1911 (The Sterling Years) The University of South Dakota College of Law was founded in 1901. Thomas Sterling served as the law school's first dean until 1911 when he left to become the third U.S. Senator from South Dakota. During the Sterling years, the law school proved successful in developing attorneys for the new state. In fact, by the time Sterling was in Congress, two of his earliest graduates William Williamson and Royal C. Johnson were Congressmen themselves. Before Sterling and the College of Law, the few lawyers there were, came from eastern states or read law for admission into the bar. Along with Sterling, U.S. Ambassador to Austria Bartlett Tripp, was an integral part of establishing the school. Tripp was returning to South Dakota from his diplomatic post in Austria at the turn of the century. Tripp had been initially considered to be the running mate of President William McKinley, his friend and Albany Law School classmate, but was overlooked in lieu of then-Governor of New York Teddy Roosevelt. With no other political opportunities left to him, Tripp devoted his full attention to establishing the College of Law. He played many roles in the law school, not only was he the school's first taxation and constitutional law professor but he had served as President of the first bar association, the Constitutional Convention of South Dakota & the commission to codify South Dakota's laws, as well as the last Chief Justice of the Dakota Territory Supreme Court. Tripp and his son-in-law Charles Hall Dillon, a fellow professor, provided much of the law library's contents and upon Tripp's death donated much of his estate to the College of Law. It is speculated that had William McKinley not overlooked him for Vice President of the United States the College of Law may not have been founded as soon as it was. Thomas Sterling's 1911 departure was partly led by the death of his friend and colleague Bartlett Tripp. 1911-1984 U.S. congressional delegation from South Dakota for the 87th Congress contained three alumni from the class of 1927: Rep. E.Y. Berry, Sen. Joseph Bottum, and Rep. Harold Lovre. In 1911, Marshall McKusick became the school's second and subsequent longest-serving dean, serving until his death in 1950. The 1927 class proved to be one of the strongest classes in USD Law history, producing Frank Biegelmeier, George T. Mickelson, E.Y. Berry, Joseph Bottum, and Harold Lovre. A stronger class did not come until 1975, when USD Law produced Steven L. Zinter, David Gilbertson, Glen A. Severson, Steve T. Kirby, and Tim Johnson. In 1982, the College of Law moved from its then-82-year-old building to a new building and was renamed the 'School of Law'. During this period the law school was led by the 11th Deputy Attorney General of the United States from the Nixon Administration, Ralph E. Erickson. 1984-2016 In 1984, South Dakota Supreme Court abolished the nearly century old practice of diploma privilege, which previously admitted School of Law graduates into South Dakota bar without examination. Also in 1984, Camden 28 member and Indian Law scholar Frank Pommersheim joined the faculty. From 1993 until 2011 Barry Vickrey, a Vanderbilt law alumnus, served as Dean of the School of Law. During Vickrey's tenure, noted federalist professor Patrick Garry joined the faculty in 2003. Former CEO of the Mayo Clinic, Mike Myers served on the faculty as an elder law professor. Myers, known for his eccentric behavior, resigned in 2012 and ran for Governor of South Dakota in the next election.

After training as a choirboy, considerable youthful performing and distinguished service in the Army, Goulding joined D'Oyly Carte in 1919, with whom he would spend nearly all of his professional career. He sang 14 different principal roles with the company between 1919 and 1936, including all of the leading tenor roles in the company's 11 Gilbert and Sullivan productions, plus Cyril in Princess Ida, Strephon in Iolanthe and Mr. Box in Cox and Box. Despite his long service with the company, he was disappointed, whenever the more famous tenor Derek Oldham appeared with the company, to be given second choices of the tenor roles or to be omitted altogether, in the case of two American tours. Oldham also played the tenor roles in most of the recordings made by the company during Goulding's tenure. Life and career Early years Goulding was born in Ireland and became an orphan as an infant. He was brought up by relatives in Bristol, England, where he sang as a choirboy at St. Mary Redcliffe beginning at the age of eight. He then sang at Colston Hall with Charles Santley and Dame Clara Butt at one of the Triennial Leeds Festivals.Charles Goulding, Memories of the D'Oyly Carte, accessed 4 July 2014 After this, he performed with the Royal Orpheus Glee Club and the Bristol Amateur Operatic Society. Goulding served with distinction in the army during the World War I and was wounded several times.Stone, David. Charles Goulding, Who Was Who in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, 11 July 2002, accessed 4 July 2014 In 1919, Goulding was engaged by the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company on tour, first performing in the chorus, but soon playing principal tenor roles in the Savoy operas. His first roles, in the summer of that year, were Nanki-Poo in The Mikado, Colonel Fairfax in The Yeomen of the Guard, and Marco in The Gondoliers. He became the main tenor in another D'Oyly Carte touring company and played Nanki-Poo, Fairfax, Marco and Earl Tolloller in Iolanthe, switching the next season to the romantic baritone role of Strephon in Iolanthe instead of Tolloller. In 1921, he added to his repertoire the role of Frederic in The Pirates of Penzance and continued to play these roles for the next two years. Goulding rejoined the main company in 1923, both on tour and in the company's London seasons, playing and sometimes sharing with another tenor, the roles of Alexis in The Sorcerer, Frederic, Tolloller, Prince Hilarion in Princess Ida, Fairfax, Marco, Mr. Box in Cox and Box and Richard Dauntless in Ruddigore. The next season, he played the role of the Duke of Dunstable in Patience for the first time, and in the 1925–26 season, he added the role of Ralph Rackstraw in H.M.S. Pinafore to his list of characters sharing some of these roles from time to time. In 1926 he first played the Defendant in Trial by Jury. The Times said that Goulding's was an \\"honest tenor\\".The Times, 1 November 1932, p. 11 Later years Goulding continued to play most of these tenor roles and Mr. Box until the autumn of 1929, when Derek Oldham returned to the company to sing Ralph, Frederic, Nanki-Poo, Fairfax, Marco and Hilarion for several months. At that time, Goulding took over the role of Cyril in Princess Ida and shared Tolloller with Oldham, while continuing with the other five characters. He then resumed with all of the Gilbert and Sullivan tenor characters over the next few seasons until 1934. The D'Oyly Carte Opera Company travelled to New York City in the autumn of 1934, but Martin Beck, the manager of the eponymous theatre, insisted that the more famous Oldham play the tenor roles. Goulding rejoined the Company in February 1935, replacing Oldham for the rest of the North American tour, playing nearly all the tenor roles. Returning to England, Goulding split the tenor roles in 1935–36, generally with John Dean. The company scheduled another US tour for the following season with Oldham, and, disappointed, Goulding left the company. Afterwards, Goulding sang in a number of Gilbert and Sullivan concerts, and he taught singing, as well as directing Gilbert and Sullivan for amateur companies. Goulding often attended functions of the Gilbert and Sullivan Society and was an avid golfer. He was also a member of the St. Augustine Lodge of Freemasons. Goulding died at the age of 52, only three years after leaving the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company. Recordings During Goulding's tenure after rejoining the main D'Oyly Carte Opera Company in 1923, the company recorded 16 albums with HMV, but the tenor roles in most of these went to Oldham. Goulding appears only in the recordings of H.M.S. Pinafore (1930 – Ralph) and Princess Ida (1932 – Cyril; Oldham sang Hilarion). Goulding sang with D'Oyly Carte for BBC radio as Nanki-Poo in The Mikado (broadcast in 1926), Mr. Box in Cox & Box (1929), excerpts of The Mikado (as Nanki Poo) in 1932 and 1933, The Gondoliers (as Marco) in 1932 and Yeomen (as Fairfax) in 1932 and 1935, with the D'Oyly Carte.Shepherd, Marc.

It is the third single from the band's 1994 EP Jar of Flies. The song was written by guitarist and vocalist Jerry Cantrell, who sings lead vocals in the first part of the song, followed by Layne Staley in the second part. The single spent seven weeks on Billboard's Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and peaked at No. 25. Composition The song is very melancholic and soft; this is largely due to the lack of electrically amplified instruments—replaced by the gentle wail of a harmonica, and especially the lack of a rhythm section during the first half of the song. Lead guitarist/vocalist Jerry Cantrell sings during most of the song except the bridge, which vocalist Layne Staley sings. Bassist Mike Inez, musician Randy Biro and Jerry Cantrell's guitar tech Darrell Peters sang backing vocals for the second part of the song. Producer Toby Wright said of \\"Don't Follow\\": > \\"It was Jerry's concept of having him start out the song, Layne come in, and > then we finish up [with a] two-sides-to-the-story type of thing, which I > thought was a brilliant concept\\". Release and reception \\"Don't Follow\\" was released as a single in October 1994, and peaked at number 25 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart in the week of December 3, 1994. Ned Raggett of Allmusic called the song \\"one of the best\\" by Alice in Chains, referred to Cantrell's vocals on the song as \\"some of his best work ever,\\" and said that the song \\"finds the band at its most calm, reflective, and gently warming.\\" Live performances \\"Don't Follow\\" was never performed live with Alice in Chains' original lead vocalist, Layne Staley. The first time the band performed the song was at their concert at the Marquee Theatre in Tempe, Arizona on September 25, 2006, with new vocalist William DuVall sharing vocals with Jerry Cantrell. The song was often performed during the band's reunion concerts between 2006 and 2007. Jerry Cantrell performed the song during his solo concert at the Pico Union Project in Los Angeles on December 7, 2019. Use in other media \\"Don't Follow\\" is the intro music for Lily Cornell Silver's IGTV interview series focused on mental health, \\"Mind Wide Open\\", released on July 20, 2020 in honor of her late father Chris Cornell's 56th birthday. Silver explained why she chose the song: > I was having some people make intro music for me, and none of it was > sounding quite right. And my mom [Alice in Chains manager Susan Silver] was > like, “Let's think. What about an Alice song?” Hold up, Jar of Flies' “Don't > Follow” was the first song I clicked on. And I was like, “Oh, that sounds so > rad.” And then, Layne [Staley] obviously had his own struggles with mental > health and addiction. And I've learned a ton from those guys. So it just had > a lot of meaning to me in that way, in terms of what I've learned from them > about strength, fortitude, stamina, and overcoming grief and loss.

Gay co-founded FutureWave Software in 1993. For a decade, he was the main programmer and visionary of Flash, an animation editor for web pages. He founded Software as Art, which was later renamed Greenbox, which made energy management solutions for the home. Early days Games programmed by Jonathan Gay While in high school, Gay won a science fair award for programming on an Apple II computer and came to the attention of Silicon Beach Software founder Charlie Jackson. Gay began programming for Silicon Beach in his senior year. His first published product, released in 1985, was Airborne!, a black-and-white game for the Macintosh computer. While in college, he collaborated with game designer Mark Pierce and programmed Dark Castle and Beyond Dark Castle. All three were award-winning programs that included digital sounds, an unusual innovation for that era. After graduating from Harvey Mudd College in Claremont, California, Gay worked full-time for Silicon Beach Software. During this time he added some significant features to Superpaint 2, including Bézier curves, and began work on IntelliDraw, which was published by Aldus after the acquisition of Silicon Beach Software in 1990. FutureWave Software Products that Jonathan Gay worked on In 1993, Gay and Jackson founded FutureWave Software with the intention of creating graphics software for pen computing, in particular the Penpoint operating system that ran on the EO Personal Communicator. Gay and programmer Robert Tatsumi finished the company's first product in 1994, SmartSketch, a vector- drawing program for the PenPoint operating system. Shortly thereafter, PenPoint was discontinued, ending that market for SmartSketch. SmartSketch was ported to the Windows and Macintosh operating systems, but with the advent in 1995 of the World Wide Web, Gay saw an opportunity to create an editor that could produce animations for web pages. The core technology of SmartSketch was repurposed to create a new product, FutureSplash Animator, adding support for timeline animation and a Netscape browser plug-in for playing back content. FutureSplash Animator was released in May, 1996. Macromedia When MSN and Disney decided to use FutureSplash Animator for their websites, Macromedia made an offer to buy FutureWave Software and the acquisition was completed in December, 1996. FutureSplash Animator was renamed Flash 1.0. Flash and Director The acquisition of FutureWave by Macromedia was unusual in that Macromedia's flagship product, Macromedia Director, overlapped with FutureSplash's functionality in many ways. Both were essentially animation/multimedia solutions consisting of an authoring tool and a browser plug-in runtime. As a Web technology, Flash had the advantage of a smaller runtime (on the order of 100 kilobytes, whereas Director's Shockwave runtime weighed over a megabyte), as well as a learning curve that was significantly less steep owing to the lower complexity of the product. Director was weighed down by six releases of accumulated legacy, and in particular because its original target was the CD-ROM market, not the Web. Initially, the nascent Flash team within Macromedia was quite small, with few engineers beyond Gay and Tatsumi, and corporate R&D; investment in Director remained high. Over the years that followed, the Director team would shrink to a handful of people and the Flash team would grow rapidly as Flash came to dominate the market for Web-based interactive media. Macromedia wrestled with the cross-product positioning of Flash and Director for several years, trying repeatedly and with limited success to position Director as the \\"big brother\\" to Flash, to be used for situations where Flash hit its limitations. Director continues to be one of the most popular tools for authoring multimedia CD-ROM's, although Flash is also used for this purpose. Flash 1–4 Gay took on the role of Vice President of Engineering at Macromedia and led the newly minted Flash engineering team at Macromedia's headquarters in San Francisco, beginning a decade of leading the Flash agenda at Macromedia. In an unusual move for a Vice President, Gay continued to be responsible for a great deal of the actual coding on the product. He was responsible for the low-level vector graphics rasterization, pen-computing inspired drawing tools, and the Flash Player Netscape browser plug-in. Tatsumi wrote the bulk of the user interface code for the Flash authoring tool. During these early releases, only a handful of other engineers joined the Flash team. An important addition to the team was programmer Gary Grossman, who implemented a subset of JavaScript (called ActionScript) into Flash 4. This expanded programming capability allowed Flash to be used for many different purposes. Flash video: Tin Can As the engineering team grew in size, other engineers began to step in and take over pieces of the Flash codebase, freeing Gay up to focus on higher-level product strategy. After Flash 4, he took on more of a pure leadership role, continuing to guide the evolution of Flash from an animation engine to a full-featured multimedia runtime and application platform. During the development of Flash 5, Gay took a several month hiatus from day-to-day operations of the Flash team to think about new projects of strategic importance to the company. At that time, engineering VP Peter Santangeli took over leadership of the Flash team and would lead the team for Flash 5 and Flash MX. When Jon returned, he was armed with a vision for a new class of Web applications that enabled communication, collaboration and what he called \\"online storytelling.\\" He saw the Flash Player's success and ubiquity as an opportunity for bringing the real-time communication technology that these applications would require to every computer running the Flash Player. He founded a new team alongside the Flash team to fulfill this vision, building a product which he code named \\"Tin Can,\\" a reference to the tin can telephone made by children using two tin cans and a string. This new team and the Flash team worked together to incorporate two-way, real-time video and audio technology into the Flash Player, the first incarnation of which was released in March 2002 as part of Macromedia Flash Player 6. At the same time, the Tin Can team built a new server product, Flash Communication Server (now Flash Media Server), which communicated with the Flash Player over a new real-time protocol called RTMP. Tin Can could be used for use cases as simple as streaming a video over the Web, or as sophisticated as a videoconferencing system. The new video-enabled Flash Player quickly became one of the most popular means of deploying video on the World Wide Web. The Flash Player's ubiquity enabled Flash video to bypass a principal drawback of competing video technologies, which was the requirement for the end-user to download and install an additional browser plug-in or helper application. Other advantages of Flash video were the lack of \\"chrome\\" around the video player window which competing players typically displayed, and the customizability of the interface which enabled Web developers to create their own stylized video-playing widgets in Flash. Flash video is now an essential technology used by prominent Web sites such as YouTube, NBC.com, DailyMotion, MetaCafe and JumpCut. Breeze Ben Dillon and Peter Santangeli went on to found the Breeze team at Macromedia, building an enterprise-class Web conferencing, E-Learning and collaboration system on top of the Flash Media Server. Gay served as the engineering lead and product visionary for the \\"Breeze Live\\" web conferencing elements of the product. Despite the possibly revolutionary nature of the communication capabilities of the Flash Media Server, it did not meet initially with great business success. Macromedia saw Breeze as a means of getting Flash Media Server \\"over the hump.\\" By building a solution on top of Breeze, the Breeze team had many goals: it sought to demonstrate what kind of applications could be built on the Flash Media Server platform, explore a new business model for a company traditionally focused on shrink-wrap tools software, and understand the attendant difficulties in building applications on the Flash Media Server platform. Incorporating technology acquired from Presedia, Breeze translated Microsoft PowerPoint presentations into Flash SWF files which could be viewed on the Web, with an accompanying audio track recorded by the presenter. Breeze could be used for a variety of uses, including corporate presentations, quarterly earnings calls, and distance learning. Breeze also featured \\"Breeze Live,\\" a conferencing system built as a Flash application which utilized the Flash Media Server to enable two-way video/audio chat, shared whiteboarding, screen sharing and shared presentation viewing. Following the Adobe Systems acquisition of Macromedia, Breeze became Adobe Connect. Success of Flash By 2001, there were 50 people working on Flash, 500,000 developers were using it and over 325 million people had the Flash Player that worked with their web browsers. In 2007, a survey found that the Flash Player was installed on 96% of Internet- enabled desktops worldwide and was used by over 2 million professionals. Work after Macromedia On April 18, 2005, Adobe Systems, Inc. announced the acquisition of Macromedia. Gay ultimately decided to pursue other opportunities in lieu of joining the combined company. When Gay left Macromedia in December 2005, he held the title of Chief Technology Officer. Software as Art In August 2006, Gay founded a new software venture, Software as Art, in partnership with three other former veterans of the Flash and Breeze teams, Tatsumi, Grossman, and Santangeli. The company developed energy management solutions for the home. Silver Spring Networks In October 2009, Software as Art (by then renamed Greenbox) was acquired by Silver Spring Networks. Leaving IT In May 2010, he was running a small business selling grass-fed beef direct to consumers. Explory In May 2013, he tried to return into software business, launching successful Kickstarter campaign for Explory, mobile video app. References External links * * The Flash History by Rick Waldron * The History of Flash by Jonathan Gay Category:Computer programmers Category:American computer businesspeople Category:Harvey Mudd College alumni Category:Living people Category:1967 births Category:Dark Castle ","title":"Jonathan Gay"},{"id":"12414893","text":"\\"Shut Down\\" is the first single released by Australian rock band Australian Crawl from their third studio album Sons of Beaches.

Drag lines (a signature of the torch's oxygen jet) are visible. A cutting torch being used to cut a steel pipe. A safe oxy-fuel welding station. Oxy-fuel welding (commonly called oxyacetylene welding, oxy welding, or gas welding in the United States) and oxy-fuel cutting are processes that use fuel gases (or liquid fuels such as gasoline) and oxygen to weld or cut metals. French engineers Edmond Fouché and Charles Picard became the first to develop oxygen-acetylene welding in 1903.Carlisle, Rodney (2004). Scientific American Inventions and Discoveries, p.365. John Wright & Songs, Inc., New Jersey. . Pure oxygen, instead of air, is used to increase the flame temperature to allow localized melting of the workpiece material (e.g. steel) in a room environment. A common propane/air flame burns at about , a propane/oxygen flame burns at about , an oxyhydrogen flame burns at and an acetylene/oxygen flame burns at about . During the early 20th century, before the development and availability of coated arc welding electrodes in the late 1920s that were capable of making sound welds in steel, oxy-acetylene welding was the only process capable of making welds of exceptionally high quality in virtually all metals in commercial use at the time. These included not only carbon steel but also alloy steels, cast iron, aluminium, and magnesium. In recent decades it has been superseded in almost all industrial uses by various arc welding methods offering greater speed and, in the case of gas tungsten arc welding, the capability of welding very reactive metals such as titanium. Oxy-acetylene welding is still used for metal-based artwork and in smaller home-based shops, as well as situations where accessing electricity (e.g., via an extension cord or portable generator) would present difficulties. The oxy-acetylene (and other oxy-fuel gas mixtures) welding torch remains a mainstay heat source for manual brazing and braze welding, as well as metal forming, preparation, and localized heat treating. In addition, oxy-fuel cutting is still widely used, both in heavy industry and light industrial and repair operations. In oxy-fuel welding, a welding torch is used to weld metals. Welding metal results when two pieces are heated to a temperature that produces a shared pool of molten metal. The molten pool is generally supplied with additional metal called filler. Filler material selection depends upon the metals to be welded. In oxy-fuel cutting, a torch is used to heat metal to its kindling temperature. A stream of oxygen is then trained on the metal, burning it into a metal oxide that flows out of the kerf as dross.The Oxy-Acetylene Handbook, Union Carbide Corp 1975 Torches that do not mix fuel with oxygen (combining, instead, atmospheric air) are not considered oxy-fuel torches and can typically be identified by a single tank (oxy-fuel cutting requires two isolated supplies, fuel and oxygen). Most metals cannot be melted with a single-tank torch. Consequently, single-tank torches are typically suitable for soldering and brazing but not for welding. Uses Oxy-fuel torches are or have been used for: *Heating metal: in automotive and other industries for the purposes of loosening seized fasteners. *Neutral flame is used for joining and cutting of all ferrous and non ferrous metals except brass. *Depositing metal to build up a surface, as in hardfacing. *Also, oxy-hydrogen flames are used: **in stone working for \\"flaming\\" where the stone is heated and a top layer crackles and breaks. A steel circular brush is attached to an angle grinder and used to remove the first layer leaving behind a bumpy surface similar to hammered bronze. **in the glass industry for \\"fire polishing\\". **in jewelry production for \\"water welding\\" using a water torch (an oxyhydrogen torch whose gas supply is generated immediately by electrolysis of water). **in automotive repair, removing a seized bolt. **formerly, to heat lumps of quicklime to obtain a bright white light called limelight, in theatres or optical (\\"magic\\") lanterns. **formerly, in platinum works, as platinum is fusible only in the oxyhydrogen flame and in an electric furnace. In short, oxy-fuel equipment is quite versatile, not only because it is preferred for some sorts of iron or steel welding but also because it lends itself to brazing, braze-welding, metal heating (for annealing or tempering, bending or forming), rust or scale removal, the loosening of corroded nuts and bolts, and is a ubiquitous means of cutting ferrous metals. Apparatus The apparatus used in gas welding consists basically of an oxygen source and a fuel gas source (usually contained in cylinders), two pressure regulators and two flexible hoses (one for each cylinder), and a torch. This sort of torch can also be used for soldering and brazing. The cylinders are often carried in a special wheeled trolley. There have been examples of oxyhydrogen cutting sets with small (scuba-sized) gas cylinders worn on the user's back in a backpack harness, for rescue work and similar. There are also examples of both non-pressurized and pressurized liquid fuel cutting torches, usually using gasoline (petrol). These are used for their increased cutting power over gaseous fuel systems and also greater portability compared to systems requiring two high pressure tanks. Regulator The regulator ensures that pressure of the gas from the tanks matches the required pressure in the hose. The flow rate is then adjusted by the operator using needle valves on the torch. Accurate flow control with a needle valve relies on a constant inlet pressure. Most regulators have two stages. The first stage is a fixed-pressure regulator, which releases gas from the cylinder at a constant intermediate pressure, despite the pressure in the cylinder falling as the gas in it is consumed. This is similar to the first stage of a scuba-diving regulator. The adjustable second stage of the regulator controls the pressure reduction from the intermediate pressure to the low outlet pressure. The regulator has two pressure gauges, one indicating cylinder pressure, the other indicating hose pressure. The adjustment knob of the regulator is sometimes roughly calibrated for pressure, but an accurate setting requires observation of the gauge. Some simpler or cheaper oxygen-fuel regulators have only a single-stage regulator, or only a single gauge. A single-stage regulator will tend to allow a reduction in outlet pressure as the cylinder is emptied, requiring manual readjustment. For low-volume users, this is an acceptable simplification. Welding regulators, unlike simpler LPG heating regulators, retain their outlet (hose) pressure gauge and do not rely on the calibration of the adjustment knob. The cheaper single-stage regulators may sometimes omit the cylinder contents gauge, or replace the accurate dial gauge with a cheaper and less precise \\"rising button\\" gauge. Gas hoses The hoses are designed for use in welding and cutting metal. A double-hose or twinned design can be used, meaning that the oxygen and fuel hoses are joined together. If separate hoses are used, they should be clipped together at intervals approximately apart, although that is not recommended for cutting applications, because beads of molten metal given off by the process can become lodged between the hoses where they are held together, and burn through, releasing the pressurised gas inside, which in the case of fuel gas usually ignites. The hoses are color- coded for visual identification. The color of the hoses varies between countries. In the United States, the oxygen hose is green and the fuel hose is red. In the UK and other countries, the oxygen hose is blue (black hoses may still be found on old equipment), and the acetylene (fuel) hose is red. If liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) fuel, such as propane, is used, the fuel hose should be orange, indicating that it is compatible with LPG. LPG will damage an incompatible hose, including most acetylene hoses. The threaded connectors on the hoses are handed to avoid accidental mis-connection: the thread on the oxygen hose is right-handed (as normal), while the fuel gas hose has a left- handed thread. The left-handed threads also have an identifying groove cut into their nuts. Gas-tight connections between the flexible hoses and rigid fittings are made by using crimped hose clips or ferrules, often referred to as 'O' clips, over barbed spigots. The use of worm-drive hose clips or Jubilee Clips is specifically forbidden in the UK and other countries. Non-return valve Acetylene is not just flammable; in certain conditions it is explosive. Although it has an upper flammability limit in air of 81%, acetylene's explosive decomposition behaviour makes this irrelevant. If a detonation wave enters the acetylene tank, the tank will be blown apart by the decomposition. Ordinary check valves that normally prevent backflow cannot stop a detonation wave because they are not capable of closing before the wave passes around the gate. For that reason a flashback arrestor is needed. It is designed to operate before the detonation wave makes it from the hose side to the supply side. Between the regulator and hose, and ideally between hose and torch on both oxygen and fuel lines, a flashback arrestor and/or non-return valve (check valve) should be installed to prevent flame or oxygen-fuel mixture being pushed back into either cylinder and damaging the equipment or causing a cylinder to explode. European practice is to fit flashback arrestors at the regulator and check valves at the torch. US practice is to fit both at the regulator. The flashback arrestor prevents shock waves from downstream coming back up the hoses and entering the cylinder, possibly rupturing it, as there are quantities of fuel/oxygen mixtures inside parts of the equipment (specifically within the mixer and blowpipe/nozzle) that may explode if the equipment is incorrectly shut down, and acetylene decomposes at excessive pressures or temperatures. In case the pressure wave has created a leak downstream of the flashback arrestor, it will remain switched off until someone resets it. Check valve A check valve lets gas flow in one direction only. It is usually a chamber containing a ball that is pressed against one end by a spring. Gas flow one way pushes the ball out of the way, and a lack of flow or a reverse flow allows the spring to push the ball into the inlet, blocking it. Not to be confused with a flashback arrestor, a check valve is not designed to block a shock wave. The shock wave could occur while the ball is so far from the inlet that the wave will get past the ball before it can reach its off position. Torch The torch is the tool that the welder holds and manipulates to make the weld. It has a connection and valve for the fuel gas and a connection and valve for the oxygen, a handle for the welder to grasp, and a mixing chamber (set at an angle) where the fuel gas and oxygen mix, with a tip where the flame forms. Two basic types of torches are positive pressure type and low pressure or injector type. The top torch is a welding torch and the bottom is a cutting torch Welding torch A welding torch head is used to weld metals. It can be identified by having only one or two pipes running to the nozzle, no oxygen-blast trigger, and two valve knobs at the bottom of the handle letting the operator adjust the oxygen and fuel flow respectively. Cutting torch A cutting torch head is used to cut materials. It is similar to a welding torch, but can be identified by the oxygen blast trigger or lever. When cutting, the metal is first heated by the flame until it is cherry red. Once this temperature is attained, oxygen is supplied to the heated parts by pressing the oxygen-blast trigger. This oxygen reacts with the metal, producing more heat and forming an oxide which is then blasted out of the cut. It is the heat that continues the cutting process. The cutting torch only heats the metal to start the process; further heat is provided by the burning metal. The melting point of the iron oxide is around half that of the metal being cut. As the metal burns, it immediately turns to liquid iron oxide and flows away from the cutting zone. However, some of the iron oxide remains on the workpiece, forming a hard \\"slag\\" which can be removed by gentle tapping and/or grinding. Rose bud torch A rose bud torch is used to heat metals for bending, straightening, etc. where a large area needs to be heated. It is so-called because the flame at the end looks like a rose bud. A welding torch can also be used to heat small areas such as rusted nuts and bolts. Injector torch A typical oxy-fuel torch, called an equal-pressure torch, merely mixes the two gases. In an injector torch, high-pressure oxygen comes out of a small nozzle inside the torch head which drags the fuel gas along with it, using the Venturi effect. Fuels Oxy-fuel processes may use a variety of fuel gases, the most common being acetylene. Other gases that may be used are propylene, liquified petroleum gas (LPG), propane, natural gas, hydrogen, and MAPP gas. Many brands use different kinds of gases in their mixes. Acetylene Acetylene generator as used in Bali by reaction of calcium carbide with water. This is used where acetylene cylinders are not available. The term 'Las Karbit' means acetylene (carbide) welding in Indonesian. Acetylene is the primary fuel for oxy-fuel welding and is the fuel of choice for repair work and general cutting and welding. Acetylene gas is shipped in special cylinders designed to keep the gas dissolved. The cylinders are packed with porous materials (e.g. kapok fibre, diatomaceous earth, or (formerly) asbestos), then filled to around 50% capacity with acetone, as acetylene is soluble in acetone. This method is necessary because above 207 kPa (30 lbf/in²) (absolute pressure) acetylene is unstable and may explode. There is about 1700 kPa (250 psi) pressure in the tank when full. Acetylene when combined with oxygen burns at 3200 °C to 3500 °C (5800 °F to 6300 °F), highest among commonly used gaseous fuels. As a fuel acetylene's primary disadvantage, in comparison to other fuels, is high cost. As acetylene is unstable at a pressure roughly equivalent to 33 feet/10 meters underwater, water-submerged cutting and welding is reserved for hydrogen rather than acetylene. Compressed gas cylinders containing oxygen and MAPP gas. Gasoline Oxy-gasoline, also known as oxy-petrol, torches have been found to perform very well, especially where bottled gas fuel is not available or difficult to transport to the worksite. Tests showed that an oxy-gasoline torch can cut steel plate up to thick at the same rate as oxy-acetylene. In plate thicknesses greater than the cutting rate was better than that of oxy- acetylene; at it was three times faster.https://www.dndkm.org/DOEKMDocuments/ITSR/DND/Oxy-Gasoline_Torch.pdf The gasoline is fed either from a pressurised tank (whose pressure can be hand-pumped or fed from a gas cylinder). Or from a non-pressurised tank with the fuel being drawn into the torch by venturi action by the pressurised oxygen flow. Another low cost approach commonly used by jewelry makers in Asia is using air bubbled through a gasoline container by a foot-operated air pump, and burning the fuel-air mixture in a specialized welding torch. Hydrogen Hydrogen has a clean flame and is good for use on aluminium. It can be used at a higher pressure than acetylene and is therefore useful for underwater welding and cutting. It is a good type of flame to use when heating large amounts of material. The flame temperature is high, about 2,000 °C for hydrogen gas in air at atmospheric pressure, and up to 2800 °C when pre-mixed in a 2:1 ratio with pure oxygen (oxyhydrogen). Hydrogen is not used for welding steels and other ferrous materials, because it causes hydrogen embrittlement. For some oxyhydrogen torches the oxygen and hydrogen are produced by electrolysis of water in an apparatus which is connected directly to the torch. Types of this sort of torch: * The oxygen and the hydrogen are led off the electrolysis cell separately and are fed into the two gas connections of an ordinary oxy-gas torch. This happens in the water torch, which is sometimes used in small torches used in making jewelry and electronics. * The mixed oxygen and hydrogen are drawn from the electrolysis cell and are led into a special torch designed to prevent flashback. See oxyhydrogen. MPS and MAPP gas Methylacetylene-propadiene (MAPP) gas and LPG gas are similar fuels, because LPG gas is liquefied petroleum gas mixed with MPS. It has the storage and shipping characteristics of LPG and has a heat value a little lower than that of acetylene. Because it can be shipped in small containers for sale at retail stores, it is used by hobbyists and large industrial companies and shipyards because it does not polymerize at high pressures — above 15 psi or so (as acetylene does) and is therefore much less dangerous than acetylene. Further, more of it can be stored in a single place at one time, as the increased compressibility allows for more gas to be put into a tank. MAPP gas can be used at much higher pressures than acetylene, sometimes up to 40 or 50 psi in high-volume oxy-fuel cutting torches which can cut up to steel. Other welding gases that develop comparable temperatures need special procedures for safe shipping and handling. MPS and MAPP are recommended for cutting applications in particular, rather than welding applications. On 31 April 2008 the Petromont Varennes plant closed its methylacetylene/propadiene crackers. As it was the only North American plant making MAPP gas, many substitutes were introduced by companies that had repackaged the Dow and Varennes product(s) - most of these substitutes are propylene, see below. Propylene and Fuel Gas Propylene is used in production welding and cutting. It cuts similarly to propane. When propylene is used, the torch rarely needs tip cleaning. There is often a substantial advantage to cutting with an injector torch (see the propane section) rather than an equal-pressure torch when using propylene. Quite a few North American suppliers have begun selling propylene under proprietary trademarks such as FG2 and Fuel-Max. Butane, propane and butane/propane mixes Butane, like propane, is a saturated hydrocarbon. Butane and propane do not react with each other and are regularly mixed. Butane boils at 0.6 °C. Propane is more volatile, with a boiling point of -42 °C. Vaporization is rapid at temperatures above the boiling points. The calorific (heat) values of the two are almost equal. Both are thus mixed to attain the vapor pressure that is required by the end user and depending on the ambient conditions. If the ambient temperature is very low, propane is preferred to achieve higher vapor pressure at the given temperature. Propane does not burn as hot as acetylene in its inner cone, and so it is rarely used for welding. Propane, however, has a very high number of BTUs per cubic foot in its outer cone, and so with the right torch (injector style) can make a faster and cleaner cut than acetylene, and is much more useful for heating and bending than acetylene. The maximum neutral flame temperature of propane in oxygen is . Propane is cheaper than acetylene and easier to transport. The role of oxygen Oxygen is not the fuel. It is what chemically combines with the fuel to produce the heat for welding. This is called 'oxidation', but the more specific and more commonly used term in this context is 'combustion'. In the case of hydrogen, the product of combustion is simply water. For the other hydrocarbon fuels, water and carbon dioxide are produced. The heat is released because the molecules of the products of combustion have a lower energy state than the molecules of the fuel and oxygen. In oxy-fuel cutting, oxidation of the metal being cut (typically iron) produces nearly all of the heat required to \\"burn\\" through the workpiece. Oxygen is usually produced elsewhere by distillation of liquefied air and shipped to the welding site in high-pressure vessels (commonly called \\"tanks\\" or \\"cylinders\\") at a pressure of about 21,000 kPa (3,000 lbf/in² = 200 atmospheres). It is also shipped as a liquid in Dewar type vessels (like a large Thermos jar) to places that use large amounts of oxygen. It is also possible to separate oxygen from air by passing the air, under pressure, through a zeolite sieve that selectively adsorbs the nitrogen and lets the oxygen (and argon) pass. This gives a purity of oxygen of about 93%. This method works well for brazing, but higher-purity oxygen is necessary to produce a clean, slag-free kerf when cutting. Types of flame The welder can adjust the oxy-acetylene flame to be carbonizing (aka reducing), neutral, or oxidizing. Adjustment is made by adding more or less oxygen to the acetylene flame. The neutral flame is the flame most generally used when welding or cutting. The welder uses the neutral flame as the starting point for all other flame adjustments because it is so easily defined. This flame is attained when welders, as they slowly open the oxygen valve on the torch body, first see only two flame zones. At that point, the acetylene is being completely burned in the welding oxygen and surrounding air. The flame is chemically neutral. The two parts of this flame are the light blue inner cone and the darker blue to colorless outer cone. The inner cone is where the acetylene and the oxygen combine. The tip of this inner cone is the hottest part of the flame. It is approximately and provides enough heat to easily melt steel. In the inner cone the acetylene breaks down and partly burns to hydrogen and carbon monoxide, which in the outer cone combine with more oxygen from the surrounding air and burn. An excess of acetylene creates a carbonizing flame. This flame is characterized by three flame zones; the hot inner cone, a white-hot \\"acetylene feather\\", and the blue-colored outer cone. This is the type of flame observed when oxygen is first added to the burning acetylene. The feather is adjusted and made ever smaller by adding increasing amounts of oxygen to the flame. A welding feather is measured as 2X or 3X, with X being the length of the inner flame cone. The unburned carbon insulates the flame and drops the temperature to approximately . The reducing flame is typically used for hard facing operations or backhand pipe welding techniques. The feather is caused by incomplete combustion of the acetylene to cause an excess of carbon in the flame. Some of this carbon is dissolved by the molten metal to carbonize it. The carbonizing flame will tend to remove the oxygen from iron oxides which may be present, a fact which has caused the flame to be known as a \\"reducing flame\\". The oxidizing flame is the third possible flame adjustment. It occurs when the ratio of oxygen to acetylene required for a neutral flame has been changed to give an excess of oxygen. This flame type is observed when welders add more oxygen to the neutral flame. This flame is hotter than the other two flames because the combustible gases will not have to search so far to find the necessary amount of oxygen, nor heat up as much thermally inert carbon. It is called an oxidizing flame because of its effect on metal. This flame adjustment is generally not preferred. The oxidizing flame creates undesirable oxides to the structural and mechanical detriment of most metals. In an oxidizing flame, the inner cone acquires a purplish tinge and gets pinched and smaller at the tip, and the sound of the flame gets harsh. A slightly oxidizing flame is used in braze-welding and bronze- surfacing while a more strongly oxidizing flame is used in fusion welding certain brasses and bronzes The size of the flame can be adjusted to a limited extent by the valves on the torch and by the regulator settings, but in the main it depends on the size of the orifice in the tip. In fact, the tip should be chosen first according to the job at hand, and then the regulators set accordingly. Welding The flame is applied to the base metal and held until a small puddle of molten metal is formed. The puddle is moved along the path where the weld bead is desired. Usually, more metal is added to the puddle as it is moved along by dipping metal from a welding rod or filler rod into the molten metal puddle. The metal puddle will travel towards where the metal is the hottest. This is accomplished through torch manipulation by the welder. The amount of heat applied to the metal is a function of the welding tip size, the speed of travel, and the welding position. The flame size is determined by the welding tip size. The proper tip size is determined by the metal thickness and the joint design. Welding gas pressures using oxy- acetylene are set in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. The welder will modify the speed of welding travel to maintain a uniform bead width. Uniformity is a quality attribute indicating good workmanship. Trained welders are taught to keep the bead the same size at the beginning of the weld as at the end. If the bead gets too wide, the welder increases the speed of welding travel. If the bead gets too narrow or if the weld puddle is lost, the welder slows down the speed of travel. Welding in the vertical or overhead positions is typically slower than welding in the flat or horizontal positions. The welder must add the filler rod to the molten puddle. The welder must also keep the filler metal in the hot outer flame zone when not adding it to the puddle to protect filler metal from oxidation. Do not let the welding flame burn off the filler metal. The metal will not wet into the base metal and will look like a series of cold dots on the base metal. There is very little strength in a cold weld. When the filler metal is properly added to the molten puddle, the resulting weld will be stronger than the original base metal. Welding lead or 'lead burning' was much more common in the 19th century to make some pipe connections and tanks. Great skill is required but can be quickly learned.Davies, J. H.. Modern methods of welding as applied to workshop practice, describing various methods: oxy-acetylene welding, electric seam welding ... eye protection in welding operations [etc.] .... New York: D. Van Nostrand Company, 1922. Print. Chapter 2 Lead Burning, 6-12. In building construction today some lead flashing is welded but soldered copper flashing is much more common in America. In the automotive body collision industry before the 1980s, oxyacetylene gas torch welding was seldom used to weld sheetmetal, since warpage was a byproduct besides the excess heat. Automotive body repair methods at the time were crude and yielded improprieties until MIG welding became the industry standard. Since the 1970s, when high strength steel became the standard for automotive manufacturing, electric welding became the preferred method. After the 1980s, the oxyacetylene torch fell out of use for sheetmetal welding in the industrialized world. Cutting For cutting, the setup is a little different. A cutting torch has a 60- or 90-degree angled head with orifices placed around a central jet. The outer jets are for preheat flames of oxygen and acetylene. The central jet carries only oxygen for cutting. The use of several preheating flames rather than a single flame makes it possible to change the direction of the cut as desired without changing the position of the nozzle or the angle which the torch makes with the direction of the cut, as well as giving a better preheat balance. Manufacturers have developed custom tips for Mapp, propane, and propylene gases to optimize the flames from these alternate fuel gases. The flame is not intended to melt the metal, but to bring it to its ignition temperature. The torch's trigger blows extra oxygen at higher pressures down the torch's third tube out of the central jet into the workpiece, causing the metal to burn and blowing the resulting molten oxide through to the other side. The ideal kerf is a narrow gap with a sharp edge on either side of the workpiece; overheating the workpiece and thus melting through it causes a rounded edge. Oxygen Rich Butane Torch Flame Fuel Rich Butane Torch Flame Cutting a rail just before renewing the rails and the ballast. Cutting is initiated by heating the edge or leading face (as in cutting shapes such as round rod) of the steel to the ignition temperature (approximately bright cherry red heat) using the pre-heat jets only, then using the separate cutting oxygen valve to release the oxygen from the central jet. The oxygen chemically combines with the iron in the ferrous material to oxidize the iron quickly into molten iron oxide, producing the cut. Initiating a cut in the middle of a workpiece is known as piercing. It is worth noting several things at this point: *The oxygen flow rate is critical; too little will make a slow ragged cut, while too much will waste oxygen and produce a wide concave cut. Oxygen lances and other custom made torches do not have a separate pressure control for the cutting oxygen, so the cutting oxygen pressure must be controlled using the oxygen regulator. The oxygen cutting pressure should match the cutting tip oxygen orifice. The tip manufacturer's equipment data should be reviewed for the proper cutting oxygen pressures for the specific cutting tip. *The oxidation of iron by this method is highly exothermic. Once it has started, steel can be cut at a surprising rate, far faster than if it were merely melted through. At this point, the pre-heat jets are there purely for assistance. The rise in temperature will be obvious by the intense glare from the ejected material, even through proper goggles. A thermic lance is a tool that also uses rapid oxidation of iron to cut through almost any material. *Since the melted metal flows out of the workpiece, there must be room on the opposite side of the workpiece for the spray to exit. When possible, pieces of metal are cut on a grate that lets the melted metal fall freely to the ground. The same equipment can be used for oxyacetylene blowtorches and welding torches, by exchanging the part of the torch in front of the torch valves. For a basic oxy-acetylene rig, the cutting speed in light steel section will usually be nearly twice as fast as a petrol- driven cut-off grinder. The advantages when cutting large sections are obvious: an oxy-fuel torch is light, small and quiet and needs very little effort to use, whereas a cut-off grinder is heavy and noisy and needs considerable operator exertion and may vibrate severely, leading to stiff hands and possible long-term vibration white finger. Oxy-acetylene torches can easily cut through ferrous materials in excess of 200 mm (8 inches). Oxygen lances are used in scrapping operations and cut sections thicker than 200 mm (8 inches). Cut-off grinders are useless for these kinds of application. Robotic oxy-fuel cutters sometimes use a high-speed divergent nozzle. This uses an oxygen jet that opens slightly along its passage. This allows the compressed oxygen to expand as it leaves, forming a high-velocity jet that spreads less than a parallel-bore nozzle, allowing a cleaner cut. These are not used for cutting by hand since they need very accurate positioning above the work. Their ability to produce almost any shape from large steel plates gives them a secure future in shipbuilding and in many other industries. Oxy- propane torches are usually used for cutting up scrap to save money, as LPG is far cheaper joule for joule than acetylene, although propane does not produce acetylene's very neat cut profile. Propane also finds a place in production, for cutting very large sections. Oxy-acetylene can cut only low- to medium- carbon steels and wrought iron. High-carbon steels are difficult to cut because the melting point of the slag is closer to the melting point of the parent metal, so that the slag from the cutting action does not eject as sparks but rather mixes with the clean melt near the cut. This keeps the oxygen from reaching the clean metal and burning it. In the case of cast iron, graphite between the grains and the shape of the grains themselves interfere with the cutting action of the torch. Stainless steels cannot be cut either because the material does not burn readily. Safety Oxygas welding station (keep cylinders and hoses away from the flame) Gas welding/cutting goggles and safety helmet Oxyacetylene welding/cutting is not difficult, but there are a good number of subtle safety points that should be learned such as: *More than 1/7 the capacity of the cylinder should not be used per hour. This causes the acetone inside the acetylene cylinder to come out of the cylinder and contaminate the hose and possibly the torch. *Acetylene is dangerous above 1 atm (15 psi) pressure. It is unstable and explosively decomposes. * Proper ventilation when welding will help to avoid large chemical exposure. The importance of eye protection Proper protection such as welding goggles should be worn at all times, including to protect the eyes against glare and flying sparks. Special safety eyewear must be used—both to protect the welder and to provide a clear view through the yellow-orange flare given off by the incandescing flux. In the 1940s cobalt melters’ glasses were borrowed from steel foundries and were still available until the 1980s. However, the lack of protection from impact, ultra-violet, infrared and blue light caused severe eyestrain and eye damage. Didymium eyewear, developed for glassblowers in the 1960s, was also borrowed—until many complained of eye problems from excessive infrared, blue light, and insufficient shading. Today very good eye protection can be found designed especially for gas-welding aluminum that cuts the sodium orange flare completely and provides the necessary protection from ultraviolet, infrared, blue light and impact, according to ANSI Z87-1989 safety standards for a Special Purpose Lens. Safety with cylinders Fuel and oxygen tanks should be fastened securely and upright to a wall, post, or portable cart. An oxygen tank is especially dangerous because the gas is stored at a pressure of 21 MPa (3000 lbf/in² = 200 atmospheres) when full. If the tank falls over and damages the valve, the tank can be jettisoned by the compressed oxygen escaping the cylinder at high speed. Tanks in this state are capable of breaking through a brick wall.\\"Air Cylinder Rocket.\\" MythBusters Discovery Channel, October 18, 2006. For this reason, never move an oxygen tank around without its valve cap screwed in place. On an oxyacetylene torch system there are three types of valves: the tank valve, the regulator valve, and the torch valve. Each gas in the system will have each of these three valves. The regulator converts the high pressure gas inside of the tanks to a low pressure stream suitable for welding. Acetylene cylinders must be maintained in an upright position to prevent the internal acetone and acetylene from separating in the filler material.https://www.dmme.virginia.gov/dmm/PDF/TRAINING/REFRESHER/MaintenanceRepairTopics/AR- oxygen-acetyleneuseandsafety.pdf Chemical exposure A less obvious hazard of welding is exposure to harmful chemicals. Exposure to certain metals, metal oxides, or carbon monoxide can often lead to severe medical conditions. Damaging chemicals can be produced from the fuel, from the work-piece, or from a protective coating on the work-piece. By increasing ventilation around the welding environment, the welders will have much less exposure to harmful chemicals from any source. The most common fuel used in welding is acetylene, which has a two-stage reaction. The primary chemical reaction involves the acetylene disassociating in the presence of oxygen to produce heat, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen gas: C2H2 \\\\+ O2 → 2CO + H2. A secondary reaction follows where the carbon monoxide and hydrogen combine with more oxygen to produce carbon dioxide and water vapor. When the secondary reaction does not burn all of the reactants from the primary reaction, the welding process can produce large amounts of carbon monoxide, and it often does. Carbon monoxide is also the byproduct of many other incomplete fuel reactions. Almost every piece of metal is an alloy of one type or another. Copper, aluminium, and other base metals are occasionally alloyed with beryllium, which is a highly toxic metal. When a metal like this is welded or cut, high concentrations of toxic beryllium fumes are released. Long-term exposure to beryllium may result in shortness of breath, chronic cough, and significant weight loss, accompanied by fatigue and general weakness. Other alloying elements such as arsenic, manganese, silver, and aluminium can cause sickness to those who are exposed. More common are the anti-rust coatings on many manufactured metal components. Zinc, cadmium, and fluorides are often used to protect irons and steels from oxidizing. Galvanized metals have a very heavy zinc coating. Exposure to zinc oxide fumes can lead to a sickness named \\"metal fume fever\\". This condition rarely lasts longer than 24 hours, but severe cases can be fatal. Not unlike common influenza, fevers, chills, nausea, cough, and fatigue are common effects of high zinc oxide exposure.  Flashback is the condition of the flame propagating down the hoses of an oxy-fuel welding and cutting system. To prevent such a situation a flashback arrestor is usually employed. The flame burns backwards into the hose, causing a popping or squealing noise. It can cause an explosion in the hose with the potential to injure or kill the operator. Using a lower pressure than recommended can cause a flashback.

The head city is in Nicoya district.  History  Proto-historical Nicoya When conquistador Gil Gonzalez Dávila entered Nicoya in 1523, it was the largest cacicazgo (chiefdom) on the Pacific coast of Costa Rica. Though it is often surmised that the city and peninsula of Nicoya derive their name from a cacique Nicoa (or Nicoya) who welcomed Dávila and his men, actually Nicoya took its name from the Nahuatl appellation Necoc Īāuh, literally \\"on both sides its water(s)\\", as Nicoya is in fact situated between two major rivers. The Peninsula de Nicoya is itself named for the city, Nicoya being the most important town in that area. The treasurer on Dávila's expedition, Andrés de Cereceda, reported a population of 6,063 inhabitants under Nicoya's leadership, almost five and a half times larger than the next largest settlement visited by the Spanish along the Pacific coast in the early 1520s.Peralta 1883:29–31. According to 16th-century chronicler Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y ValdésMeléndez 1959:363. who visited Nicoya in 1529, the layout of the indigenous community was similar to that of the larger settlements in nearby Nicaragua and included a central plaza with temples, a low pyramidal mound used for human sacrifice, and specialized plazas for markets and chiefs' residences. Many of the earliest colonial documents about pre-Columbian Nicoya appear to have been lost in a fire that burned the town's archives in 1783.ANCR Exp. 273. In the resulting documentary vacuum, a number of interpretations regarding pre-Hispanic Nicoya have emerged. Foremost among them is the belief that as the southernmost representatives of Mesoamerican culture, Nicoyans lived in nucleated villages, and that Cereceda's accounting of 6,063 souls merely represented the number of inhabitants of one village under chief Nicoya's control.Meléndez 1959. The modern city of Nicoya is generally believed to be on the site of that village. The center of Nicoya is spatially organized in the traditional Spanish-American pattern, with a central plaza surrounded by streets ordered in a grid pattern aligned with the cardinal directions. Atypically, the church is in the northeastern corner of the central plaza, not facing the plaza from a surrounding street, as was the Iberian norm. Today the church is locally referred to as the templo colonial; local oral history maintains that the church dates from some time between 1522 and 1544, when the parish of Nicoya was founded.Mora 1988. The eminent Costa Rican historian Carlos Meléndez took note of the unusual location of the templo colonial in the urban core of the city and, based on Oviedo's brief description of the indigenous community, hypothesized that the church had been built atop the indigenous sacrificial mound. Meléndez's hypothesis fits the known Spanish pattern of direct superimposition of Catholic politico-religious structures on indigenous structures such as pyramids in Mesoamerica and Andean South America, or kiva structures in the U.S. Southwest. In short, Meléndez argued that the location of the colonial church is not merely an aberration from the common Iberian pattern of facing the plaza but is coincident with the location of the sacrificial mound in the northeastern corner of the plaza of indigenous Nicoya as described by Oviedo in 1529.Meléndez 1978. Archaeological excavations were conducted in and around the city of Nicoya in the early 1990s to test these theories and to better understand how the indigenous community was transformed into a colonial town.Lawrence 23005, 2009 Excavations in the center of Nicoya failed to produce any evidence of a substantial pre-Columbian presence in the city's center. Investigations into the surrounding valley failed to identify unequivocally a single site as the probable home to Nicoya. However, several large (5–10 hectare/12–24 acre) archaeological sites were in similar ecological niches throughout the valley. They are situated along river and stream banks at the point where streams leave the hills that surround the valley and cross the undulating valley floor. This Pataky ceramic (late Period VI, AD 1000-1350) portrays a seated shaman transformed into a jaguar spirit companion form. At least two of these sites are considered likely candidates for protohistoric Nicoya. One is just outside contemporary Nicoya along the banks of the Rio Chipanzé. The other is in the hamlet of Sabana Grande, six kilometers north of Nicoya. This site appears to be larger than the rest; it exhibits low earthen mounds and is particularly prized by local looters for its high-quality polychrome pottery and gold artifacts. Apparently, a much greater quantity of high-quality artifacts have been removed from the vicinity of Sabana Grande than from Nicoya or anywhere else in the valley. Furthermore, the colonial ejido (lands held in common by the indigenous community) of the Indian community of Nicoya was in Sabana Grande, not Nicoya.ANCR Exp. 301; Exp. 792; Exp. 3710. It is only possible to consider either of these sites as protohistoric Nicoya if we discard the notion that it was a single community of over more than 6,000. Neither site is near the size necessary to hold that number of people if we accept even as an approximate Newson's (1987:87) estimates of 0.045 to 0.06 persons/hectare for Pacific Nicaragua at Spanish contact, and as little as 0.02 persons/hectare for Nicoya. A closer reading of the ethnohistoric material in conjunction with the archaeological information is necessary to form a more realistic picture of Nicoya on the eve of conquest. It is worthwhile returning to Andrés de Cereceda, treasurer of Gil Gonzalez Dávila's 1522 expedition, and review his own words in regard to Nicoya: > \\"The chief Nicoya is five leagues further on, inland: they baptized 6,603 > souls; he gave 13,442 pesos in gold, with a little more than the chief Mateo > gave\\".In Peralta 1883:30. Cereceda's figure of 6,603 is typically taken to represent the number of inhabitants of the cacique, Nicoya's town, but Cereceda never makes that assertion, only that the expedition baptized that number of people. Furthermore, he refers to a second chief, Mateo, whose residence was never specified. An alternative interpretation of Cereceda's figures would understand them as representing the inhabitants of several settlements politically affiliated with Nicoya but not the members of one massive community. The cacique Nicoya may not have had tributary villages under his direct control. But it is not unlikely that there were several villages within his orbit of influence that he could persuade to treat with the Spanish. A model of dispersed settlement of politically affiliated villages rather than one large nucleated town better fits the archaeological and ethnohistoric information. Oviedo, who visited Nicoya in 1529 and recorded aspects of the town's layout, never remarked on the great size of the settlement. Oviedo was in Nicoya before precipitous population decline had taken its effect, and one would expect some remark from this astute observer had Nicoya been such a populous and highly nucleated center. If the above hypothesis is true, what does modern-day Nicoya represent historically? Among other tools of colonial administration, the Spanish crown created a policy called congregación, or the forced resettlement of native peoples into nucleated settlements to more closely watch and control their charges. The evidence leads one to further hypothesize that the present-day Nicoya is the product of Spanish colonial congregación, formed by the forced amalgamation of people from the pre- Hispanic settlements dispersed throughout the region. When this may have been done, and under what circumstances, are unknown. As mentioned above, the historical documents, which would have recorded such an event, would have been lost in the 1783 fire that completely destroyed the colonial archives in Nicoya. Further research in other repositories may yet provide confirmation for this interpretation. Colonial Nicoya Nicoya was the largest indigenous chiefdom encountered by the Spanish when they first entered northwestern Costa Rica in 1523. Historical records are mute on what these people called themselves or the precise detail of their political organization. Other than the fact that they spoke a language belonging to the Oto-Manguean language family, nothing is known of their tongue. According to records from that first encounter in 1523, over 6,000 souls were saved by baptism performed by the expedition's priest.Oviedo y Valdez 1959. During the first 50 years of Conquest, Nicoya was of great local importance as a transshipment point between the more active Spanish colonies in Nicaragua and Panama; a staging area and breadbasket for the initial entradas, forays into the interior, by Juan Vázquez de Coronado; and a rich encomienda (source of tribute) for the governor of Nicaragua, Pedrarias Dávila and his family.Peralta 1883; Meléndez 1983. Each of these economic activities dissipated in a brief time, however, and Nicoya rapidly devolved into a colonial backwater. There is no historical record that Nicoya ever offered armed resistance against the invaders. They quickly accepted Christianity. It was armed resistance and rejection of Catholicism that justified the Holy War waged by the Spanish against the native peoples of the Americas. Regardless of justification, the historical record speaks clearly that native Nicoyans were incorporated into the Spanish colonial empire and simply became identified by the racial category of Indios (Indians). In becoming \\"Indians,\\" native Nicoyans were ascribed by royal decree to a racial category from which it was difficult to escape. Ostensibly, Spanish colonial policy was designed to protect native peoples, who were wards of the state and church. Sensible to the economic effects of massive population decline, the Crown acted during the 16th and 17th centuries to protect their charges from the ill effects of direct exposure to Europeans. Segregation was one means to an end. A colonial policy established Pueblos de Indios (Indian towns) in which Spaniards (excepting crown and ecclesiastical authorities) were prohibited from living. In essence, it provided a series of static rights and obligations and a relationship to the State that was inviolate. As newly minted Indians, 16th- century Nicoyans were taken as slaves and the community obligated to pay tribute in goods and services (known as the encomienda) to a succession of Spanish families as reward for their service to the Crown during the Conquest. As discussed above, there is indirect evidence that the native Nicoyans were forced to resettle from their original hamlets and villages to a single, nucleated town that is the Nicoya of today.Meléndez 1983. It was not uncommon for the Spanish authorities to order such resettlement to maintain control over indigenous peoples as they suffered a precipitous decline in numbers during the 16th and early 17th centuries. As populations thinned out, the Spanish would simply order the survivors to move to a single community to maintain a political, economic and ecclesiastical eye on them. Nicoya was one such Indian town and in the 1760s had no more than about 320 inhabitants.ANCR Exp. 315. The structure of social relations were established in the community, approximately two centuries before and at the time, had certainly provided a measure of security. The native Nicoyans were provided with a new social identity in the colonial order – \\"Indians\\" – and a social space in a hierarchical caste system based on race that defined their rights and obligations, and a physical space (the town) in which they could exist. The Indians were obligated to make tribute payments and were given limited powers of self-government and had (in theory) access to a public defender's office (Defensor de Indios) for their corporate legal defense. By the decade of the 1760s, however, life in Nicoya was becoming more and more tenuous. The Spanish colonial enterprise, as all colonial enterprises, was an extractive one. Valuable goods were quickly identified and exported to Spain or other colonies: at first the precious metals, followed by traffic in human beings, and later by a variety of agricultural commodities. The small Indian community could not provide sufficient labor and the region's population was therefore augmented by the presence of members from two other racial groups as recognized in Spanish colonial social system: Mulatos (undoubtedly arrived from Panama, although the historical record is silent on this issue) and Ladinos, or people of mixed Native and Spanish ancestry. What had evolved by the mid-18th century in Spanish-dominated portions of lower Central America was, in essence, a system of apartheid, in which islands of isolated indigenous communities were surrounded by non-indigenous peoples of heterogeneous background. Spanish, Mulatos and Ladinos settled on the cattle ranches surrounding Nicoya and, with direct access to the principal factor of production (land), were easily able to dominate the local economy. A creole culture emerged among the non-Indians on their dispersed ranches, a local variant of a lifestyle based on cattle ranching that spread along the Pacific margin of Central America all the way to what is now the southwestern United States. Social relations between the local creoles and the Indians of Nicoya are hard to gauge; the documentary record was not typically concerned with such matters. However, one colonial document from 1765 may be highly indicative of the poor state of relations between the two ethnic groups and illustrative of the stark difference in the degree of estrangement between the Indians of Nicoya and surrounding Ladino community.ANCR Exp. 244. The document presents a petition to the Crown by a union of 200 Ladinos to form their own town apart from that of Nicoya. The arguments supporting their request were phrased in the language of ethnic group solidarity: The Ladinos sought the improvements that came from leaving their dispersed ranches and living in a town of their own and away from the Indians in Nicoya. Nicoya was reported to be economically defunct and its community quickly dying. The choice presented by the Ladinos was one between life in a new creole town and death if they had to rely on Nicoya. The Crown agreed to their petition. The representation that the Ladinos made of social conditions in Nicoya may not have been far off the mark. Essentially isolated in their community and surrounded by more-or-less hostile neighbors, the native community persisted, it would appear, more by the weight of centripetal forces exterior to the community itself, keeping in check the centrifugal pressures within the community for dissolution. In more concrete terms, the economic and political needs of the State maintained the artificial boundaries and structure of an \\"Indian\\" community, well past the date when the community, as an ethnically identifiable social entity, would have dissolved through the typical processes of acculturation and assimilation. To this historically particular moment we add the structural contradictions in the political structure of the Spanish colonies. The point of contact between Crown and Indians was the local administrative authority, the Corregidor. Provided enormous leeway in the weak state system of colonial governance, the position of Corregidor was purchased. The individual who held it for a specified number of years was free to exploit it for his personal economic benefit by functioning within a closed market system as the sole distributor of manufactured goods to the Indians in the towns they controlled and by purchasing marketable goods produced by the 'Indians' under their charge. No controls were placed on prices beyond the caprice of the Corregidor, who had the coercive power of the state to insure that the price demands were met. While the Corregidor did fulfill an important economic role, clearly the system was ripe for abuse, and abused it was.Baskes 2000. The Indian revolt of 1760–61 By the mid-18th century, the middle phase of the colonial period, an uneasy balance of power and authority had evolved between different elements of colonial society in Nicoya and its surrounding hinterland. The Indian community of Nicoya persisted weakly as a shadow of its former self, maintained by a tradition of reciprocal ties of rights and obligations to patriarchal Crown authority. However, this tradition rested primarily on a crucial link, the Corregidor, and in late 1750s this tradition was turned on its head and Nicoya as an independent ethnic community began to unravel. In 1756, Don Santiago Alfeiran was appointed Corregidor of Nicoya. A Spaniard, he had never set foot in Nicoya until he arrived to take his post in 1758.Fernandez Guardia 1938. Traditional relations of obligation and exchange were quickly replaced by increasingly onerous demands on the community's productive capabilities, followed by exceptionally harsh physical abuse when those demands were not met. For example, tribute in Nicoya was traditionally paid by one product that could be produced nowhere else in the region: cotton thread dyed purple with the secretion of a rare mollusk found on the Pacific Coast of the genus Murex. This dye had been exploited during pre-Columbian times, and the Nicoyans took great care not to kill the mollusk when extracting the dye. To not stress the animals, they only dyed cotton every three months.ANCR Exp. 0384. Alfeiran demanded a threefold increase in production, altering traditional forms of production that had been in effect at least since the early colonial period, if not extending into the pre- Columbian past.ANCR Exp. 498. Multiple court cases related to Alfeiran's tenure attest that this was just one, and perhaps not the most serious, example of a new order for the native community.ANCR Exp. 491.  Recent history  Nicoya was created on 7 December 1848 by decree 167. On 5 September 2012, Nicoya was struck by a magnitude 7.6 earthquake, destroying houses in the canton.  Geography  Nicoya has an area of km² and a mean elevation of metres. The Tempisque River establishes the northeast boundary of the canton, which cuts through the midsection of the Nicoya Peninsula, touching the Gulf of Nicoya on the east before curving southward to the Pacific Ocean.  Districts  The canton of Nicoya is subdivided into the following districts: # Nicoya # Mansión # San Antonio # Quebrada Honda # Sámara # Nosara # Belén de Nosarita  Demographics  For the 2011 census, Nicoya had a population of inhabitants.

Transportation   Road transportation  The canton is covered by the following road routes: Festivals The capital city of Santa Cruz, named Santa Cruz, is a typical Costa Rican rural town. Its inhabitants are very diverse and consist mostly of farmers, fishermen, workers or employees of several of the many hotels located in the vicinity. The town is known within Costa Rica for its cultural heritage and many historical traditions. These traditions include the Fiesta de Semana Santa (Easter week celebration) and the traditional bullfights as well as many others. Every year in Santa Cruz there are a number of festivals which include bull riding ceremonies. These ceremonies, though traditional at heart, lack most of the features seen in Spanish bullfighting traditions. Usually the ring in which the bull is let loose is open to anyone, tourists as well as locals – man, woman or child. The bull riding usually starts with a man being placed on the bull with nothing but a string to hold on to. This man is inevitably, after some time, thrown off. Even though there are always medical personnel in place to supervise the bull riding, severe injuries or even death among the bullriders are not uncommon. The bulls are treated with respect and dignity and in no bullring within Costa Rica is it ever alright to deliberately injure or kill a bull in a bullfight, whereas in Spain or Mexico the very purpose of the bullfight is for a trained professional to kill the bull. The canton also includes the town of Santa Bárbara, known for its traditional annual dance of the calabashes (baile de los guacales). Since 2000 the activity has been considered of cultural interest to the community and all participants receive a hand-painted calabash vessel to thank them for their economic contribution (which they paid in the form of an entrance ticket).

Fidel Castro criticised the Lusaka Accords as \\"impermissible and incredible\\", a statement that was echoed by the Soviet Union. That criticism by Angola's two chief military benefactors led to a breakdown in the treaty. It was annulled de facto on 16 May 1985, and an escalation of hostilities followed.

Early years Ernst Hellinger was born on September 30, 1883 in Striegau, Silesia, Germany (now Strzegom, Poland) to Emil and Julie Hellinger. He grew up in Breslau, attended school and graduated from the Gymnasium there in 1902. When he was studying at the Gymnasium, he became fascinated with mathematics, due to excellent mathematics teachers at the school. Academic career After graduating from the Gymnasium, Ernst Hellinger entered the University of Heidelberg, but didn't complete his studies there. After Heidelberg, he studied at the University of Breslau, before completing his doctorate at the University of Göttingen in 1907 with a thesis entitled Die Orthogonalinvarianten quadratischer Formen von unendlich vielen Variablen. At Göttingen he worked with David Hilbert, one of the most influential mathematicians of the 20th century. Hellinger taught at the University of Göttingen (1907–1909), the University of Marburg (1909–1914), and the University of Frankfurt (1914–1935). Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany in 1933, and while they were in power the Nazis removed several Jewish scientists and mathematicians from German universities. Hellinger's family was Jewish, and he was removed from the faculty of the University of Frankfurt in 1936. Later years On November 13, 1938, Hellinger was arrested, taken to the Festhalle, and then put into Dachau concentration camp. However, his friends were able to arrange a temporary job for Hellinger at Northwestern University at Evanston, Illinois in the United States. He was released from the Dachau camp after six weeks, on condition that he emigrate immediately. He joined the faculty at Northwestern University as lecturer in Mathematics in 1939. He became a U.S. citizen in 1944. Promoted to professor in 1945, he became emeritus in 1949. He died on March 28, 1950 in Chicago, Illinois, United States. Contributions to mathematics Ernst Hellinger studied integral equations, the infinite system of equations, real functions and continued fractions. A type of integral which he introduced in his dissertation became known as \\"the Hellinger integral\\", used for defining the Hellinger distance. Hellinger distance has been used to process natural language and learning word embeddings. In addition, the Hilbert–Hellinger theory of forms in infinitely many variables profoundly influenced mathematical analysis.

Bagaces is one of the oldest settlements in early Spanish conquest in the 1540s, where natives lived by a creek. It became an important town after 1601 when the \\"Mule Trail\\" was established communicating Cartago, the capital of the province, with Guatemala, the capital of the Captaincy General. Bagaces was a necessary night stop and later acquired fame because of its dry bisquist (Biscocho) and cheese (Queso Bagaces), an important supply for the long ride.  Geography  Bagaces has an area of km² and a mean elevation of metres. The Salto River on the west and Tenorio River on the east delineate this canton, with the Tempisque River as the southern border and the northern border high in the Cordillera de Guanacaste.

Dr. Moncla died while out on a call seeing one of his patients. Several of Dr. Moncla's sons settled on his former plantation along Red River. One was postmaster. The area has never been incorporated. Moncla has been a favored point of river crossing of the Red River because of the Moncla Bluffs making passage possible in bad weather in the 1800s.

The primary information related to Baal-Eser II comes from Josephus's citation of the Phoenician author Menander of Ephesus in Against Apion i.18. Here it is said that \\"Ithobalus, the priest of Astarte...was succeeded by his son Badezorus [Baal-Eser], who lived forty-five years, and reigned six years; he was succeeded by Matgenus [Mattan I] his son.\\" (see king of Tyre) Baal-Eser reigned at the height of Tyrian influence in the affairs of the Levant. During his reign, his sister was queen of Israel and his niece Athaliah reigned as queen of the Kingdom of Judah, creating a zone of Tyrian influence unrivaled at any period in its history. Tyre is not mentioned as an opponent of Shalmaneser III at the Battle of Qarqar in 853 BC,James B. Pritchard, ed.: Ancient Near Eastern Texts Relating to the Old Testament (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1969) 278-79. but twelve years later, in 841, Ithobaal's son Baal-Eser II (Ba'l-mazzer) gave tribute to the Assyrian monarch, in the latter's 18th year of reign (841 BC).Fuad Safar, \\"A Further Text of Shalmaneser III from Assur,\\" Sumer 7 (1951) 3-21. Jehu of Israel paid tribute at the same time, as shown on the Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser III.James B. Pritchard, ed.: Ancient Near Eastern Texts Relating to the Old Testament (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1969) 280. The mention of Baal-Eser's tribute to Shalmaneser has played an important role in revising upwards by 11 years the reigns of Baal-Eser's successors, Mattan I and Pygmalion, from previously accepted dates for these kings. Consequently, the dates given here are according to the work of Frank Moore Cross and other scholars who take 825 BC as the date of Dido's flight from her brother, Pygmalion of Tyre, after which she founded the city of Carthage in 814 BC. (See the chronological justification for these dates in the Pygmalion article.) For those who date the seventh year of Pygmalion to 814 BC, thereby placing the founding of Carthage in the same year that Dido left Tyre, the dates of Baal-Eser's successors will be 11 years later. The dates used for Baal-Eser in the present article also accept the six years of reign given in the best texts of Menander/Josephus. It is only in some extracts of Eusebius's Chronography that a reign of 18 years is given.

The head city is in Filadelfia district. Toponymy The name of the canton is in honor of former head of state Braulio Carrillo Colina.  History  Carrillo was created on 16 June 1877 by decree 22. In the 18th century a group of ladinos settled on the west bank of the middle Tempisque River, where there was a grove of trees called \\"sietecueros\\" (Lonchocarpus costericensi), giving rise to the population that corresponds to the city of Filadelfia, head of the canton. In Executive Decree No. 22 of June 16, 1877, Carrillo was declared a canton of Guanacaste province. The oldest population of the canton is Sardinal, proof of this is the mention of the place made by Brother Don Antonio Muñoz, following his visit in late 1794 for a collection of handouts that he performed in several villages of Guanacaste. In the 1830s, the residents of neighborhoods of Sietecueros and Sardinal, asked the then Head of State, Braulio Carrillo Colina, to be separated from the village of Santa Cruz and to be incorporated into Guanacaste City (now Liberia) in a civil and ecclesiastical way, this request was received when it was issued the Decree No. 5 of February 23, 1839. http://www.vivaguanacaste.com/index.php/localidades/canton_de_carrillo.html In the school division in 1886, Sardinal was selected as the second school district of the canton in Law No. 60 of August 9, and Filadelfia was selected as part of the first school district. The main high school (Colegio Técnico Profesional Agropecuario, Agricultural Vocational Technical High School) began his teaching activities in 1965, during the administration of Francisco Orlich Bolmarcich.  Geography  Carrillo has an area of km² and a mean elevation of metres. The canton is shaped like a boot, with the Pacific Ocean at the top. The Tempisque River decorates the front of the boot from top to toe. The Cañas and Bolsón rivers provide the heel and sole of the shape. The canton borders with Liberia to the north, Santa Cruz to the south, Bagaces to the east and Pacific Ocean to the west. Geology Carrillo is geologically constituted of materials of the Cretaceous, Tertiary and Quaternary, being Quaternary sedimentary rocks that dominate the region. * Cretaceous rocks are volcanic sedimentary and intrusive. * Among the materials of the Tertiary period, are sedimentary rocks of the Paleocene Eocene period, which corresponds to the formation of Barra Honda. * In Quaternary materials are located sedimentary rocks of the Holocene period, such as wetlands located in the area adjacent to the site Dalia. Hydrography The river system of Carrillo corresponds to the Pacific slope, Nicoya Peninsula and North Coast. * Tempisque River * Bolsón River * Las Palmas River * Cañas River * Sardinal River * San Blas River * Belén River * Gallina River * Carrizal River * Coyolito River All these watercourses rise in Carrillo, except for Tempisque and Cañas, these rivers run from northwest to southeast. Rivers Cañas, Bolsón and Tempisque are cantonal boundaries, the first two with Santa Cruz and the last with Liberia and Bagaces.  Districts  The canton of Carrillo is subdivided into the following districts: # Filadelfia # Palmira # Sardinal # Belén  Demographics  For the 2011 census, Carrillo had a population of inhabitants. The movement of people (population) for these territories are from the party of Nicoya and Nicaragua, possibly gave rise to the towns of Sietecueros, Tamarindo, Boquerones and Villita with people of mixed Spanish and indigenous people.  Transportation   Road transportation  The canton is covered by the following road routes: Economy During the 1980s and the early 1990s, this canton was one of the main producers of rice and cotton in Costa Rica. Due to El Niño and political reasons the production started to decay, causing losses of up to a thousand million colones, and the producers asked the government for a declaration of emergency. http://www.conarroz.com/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=109:arroceros- con-perdidas-millonarias&catid;=56:noticias-archivo-anos- anteriores&Itemid;=108 This canton also provides more products such as: Cantaloupe * Beans (Black, red & white ones) (Phaseolus vulgaris) * Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) * Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor subsp. drummondii) * Watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) * Honeydew (Cucumis melo) In this region highlights two millionaires-income products: * Cantaloupe (Cucumis melo var. cantalupensis) * Sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) El Viejo Mill, CATSA Mill are in charge of the production of sugar and Melones de Costa Rica is charge of the cantaloupe production. Tourism Sailing and fishing in Hermosa Beach The canton receives revenue from its high tourism-related activities. Its main tourist attractions are the Gulf of Papagayo, Playa Hermosa, Playa Panama, Coco Beach, Playa Ocotal, among others, fishing and diving activities can be performed there. Coco Beach is offering various services such as restaurants and hotels, on the other beaches there are hotels and resorts as \\"Los Corales\\", \\"Condovac La Costa\\", among others. Tempisque River is another attraction that crosses the canton and passed by the city of Filadelfia, it is possible to practice water sports such as fishing, swimming, and sailing, crossing the most impressive vegetation and observing the various species of flora and wildlife that is around it. This area is the center of archaeological research which has yielded variety of pieces dating back thousands of years, which is why it is known as the National Archaeological Region.

He primarily concentrated on Malayalam films. Career After completing his graduation Pavithran made two unsuccessful attempts to get admission at the Pune Film Institute. This failure made him join a Law College nearby the film institute at Pune. Instead of studying law, he spent his time in the Film Institute seeing world classics and how films were made. He used this opportunity to befriend the institute students and understand cinema closely. His friendship with director P. A. Backer led to the making of the film Kabani Nadi Chuvannappol (When the River Kabani Turned Red, 1975), which he produced. He made his directorial debut with Yaro Oral (Someone, 1978) for which G. Aravindan composed the music. The film was about the travails of urban life and identity crisis in the city. It introduced to Malayalam a genre of personal cinema, which is deliberately anti-realist. This won state awards for Best Direction, Best Editing and Best Cinematography. In 1981, he composed the music for T. V. Chandran's directorial debut Krishnankutty. Later he made a shift in his form of filmmaking with Uppu (Salt, 1986), where he adopted the middle-stream cinema model. In Uppu, he told the story of the atavistic Muslim practice of male polygamy. It became controversial upon release. In an interview, Pavithran commented, \\"Salt is a trifle better - the truth always is. The religious laws are almost unknowingly misused by people, leading to the exploitation of those who succumb or resign themselves to religious and social pressures. Our intention was not to victimise or ridicule a minority.\\" Uppu won the National Film Award for Best Regional Film. Utharam (Answer, 1989), written by M. T. Vasudevan Nair and starring Mammootty, is about the investigative journey that the protagonist embarks on in order to find the reasons behind a poet's suicide, a bizarre step she took despite her picture-perfect life. The film became a major commercial and critical success and has earned cult status. His last film Kuttappan Sakshi (Kuttappan, the Witness, 2002) begins in the pre-independence era when the communist movement was coming up in Kerala and inspiring poor peasants and other workers to raise their voice against the feudalism and the exploitation of the Nampoothiris. Death Pavithran died on 26 February 2006. He was married to Kalamandalam Kshemavathy, with whom he had two daughters, Eva, an actress in South Indian films, and Lakshmi.

Typically, IPoE uses Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol and Extensible Authentication Protocol to provide the same functionality as PPPoE, but in a less robust manner.

While 418 is the originally assigned code for the numbering plan area, all three area codes are today assigned in an overlay plan for this territory. Cities in the numbering plan area include Quebec City, Saguenay, Rivière-du- Loup and Rimouski. Also serves are the Gaspé Peninsula, Côte-Nord, southeastern Mauricie, and the tiny hamlet of Estcourt Station, in the U.S. state of Maine. History Area code 418 was one of the original area codes created by AT&T; in 1947. Since then, the numbering plan area includes mostly the eastern half of the province of Quebec. Ontario and Quebec were the only provinces to receive multiple area codes at the outset. Nominally, northwestern Quebec—one of the few areas of North America without telephone service—was reassigned from area code 514 to 418 in 1957. From the 1950s to the 1970s, 418 was also the area code for the eastern Northwest Territories. However, in the 1970s, as direct distance dialling was introduced to the far northern and western portions of 418, these points were reassigned to area code 819. Despite Quebec City's rapid growth, by the turn of the millennium, 418 was the last of Quebec and Ontario's original four area codes that had never been split. By 2006, however, 418 was on the brink of exhaustion due to Canada's system of number allocation. Every competitive local exchange carrier is allocated blocks of 10,000 numbers–corresponding to a single three-digit prefix–for every rate centre where it plans to offer service, no matter how small. Once a number is assigned to a carrier and rate centre, it cannot be moved elsewhere, even when a rate centre has more than enough numbers to serve it. This resulted in thousands of wasted numbers, and the proliferation of cell phones and pagers (especially in the larger cities) only exacerbated the problem. Additionally, a number of \\"megacities\\" created in 2002 are split between multiple rate centres that have never been amalgamated. For example, Saguenay is split between four rate centres. In 2007, the Canadian Radio- television and Telecommunications Commission assigned area code 581 as an overlay for the 418 territory. Implementation of 581 began on June 21, 2008 with the start of a permissive dialing period during which it was possible to make local calls with both seven and ten digits. Ten-digit dialing became mandatory in eastern Quebec on September 6, 2008. By 2016, 418 and 581 was again on the brink of exhaustion, due to further proliferation of cell phones and pagers. In 2017, the CRTC assigned area code 367 as a second overlay for eastern Quebec; the new area code entered service in 2018. This had the effect of assigning 23.4 million numbers to 1.8 million people. However, overlays have become the preferred method of relief in Canada, as they are an easy workaround for the number allocation problem; no area codes have been split in the country since 1999. The major incumbent local exchange carriers in the area are Bell Canada, Bell Aliant, Telus (formerly Quebec-Telephone) and Vidéotron.

It adds the star or reflexive transitive closure operation of the latter to the former, while adding the left and right residuation or implication operations of the former to the latter. Unlike dynamic logic and other modal logics of programs, for which programs and propositions form two distinct sorts, action algebra combines the two into a single sort. It can be thought of as a variant of intuitionistic logic with star and with a noncommutative conjunction whose identity need not be the top element. Unlike Kleene algebras, action algebras form a variety, which furthermore is finitely axiomatizable, the crucial axiom being a•(a → a)* ≤ a. Unlike models of the equational theory of Kleene algebras (the regular expression equations), the star operation of action algebras is reflexive transitive closure in every model of the equations. __TOC__ Definition An action algebra (A, ∨, 0, •, 1, ←, →, *) is an algebraic structure such that (A, ∨, •, 1, ←, →) forms a residuated semilattice while (A, ∨, 0, •, 1, *) forms a Kleene algebra. That is, it is any model of the joint theory of both classes of algebras. Now Kleene algebras are axiomatized with quasiequations, that is, implications between two or more equations, whence so are action algebras when axiomatized directly in this way. However, action algebras have the advantage that they also have an equivalent axiomatization that is purely equational.. The language of action algebras extends in a natural way to that of action lattices, namely by the inclusion of a meet operation.. In the following we write the inequality a ≤ b as an abbreviation for the equation a ∨ b = b. This allows us to axiomatize the theory using inequalities yet still have a purely equational axiomatization when the inequalities are expanded to equalities. The equations axiomatizing action algebra are those for a residuated semilattice, together with the following equations for star. ::: 1 ∨ a*•a* ∨ a ≤ a* ::: a* ≤ (a ∨ b)* ::: (a → a)* ≤ a → a The first equation can be broken out into three equations, 1 ≤ a*, a*•a* ≤ a*, and a ≤ a*. These force a* to be reflexive, transitive, and greater or equal to a respectively. The second axiom asserts that star is monotone. The third axiom can be written equivalently as a•(a → a)* ≤ a, a form which makes its role as induction more apparent. These two axioms in conjunction with the axioms for a residuated semilattice force a* to be the least reflexive transitive element of the semilattice greater or equal to a. Taking that as the definition of reflexive transitive closure of a, we then have that for every element a of any action algebra, a* is the reflexive transitive closure of a. The equational theory of the implication-free fragment of action algebras, those equations not containing → or ←, can be shown to coincide with the equational theory of Kleene algebras, also known as the regular expression equations. In that sense the above axioms constitute a finite axiomatization of regular expressions. Redko showed in 1967 that these equations had no finite axiomatization, for which John Horton Conway gave a shorter proof in 1971. Salomaa gave an equation schema axiomatizing this theory which Kozen subsequently reformulated as a finite axiomatization using quasiequations, or implications between equations, the crucial quasiequations being those of induction: if x•a ≤ x then x•a* ≤ x, and if a•x ≤ x then a*•x ≤ x. Kozen defined a Kleene algebra to be any model of this finite axiomatization. Conway showed that the equational theory of regular expressions admit models in which a* was not the reflexive transitive closure of a, by giving a four-element model 0 ≤ 1 ≤ a ≤ a* in which a•a = a. In Conway's model, a is reflexive and transitive, whence its reflexive transitive closure should be a. However the regular expressions do not enforce this, allowing a* to be strictly greater than a. Such anomalous behavior is not possible in an action algebra. Examples Any Heyting algebra (and hence any Boolean algebra) is made an action algebra by taking • to be ∧ and a* = 1. This is necessary and sufficient for star because the top element 1 of a Heyting algebra is its only reflexive element, and is transitive as well as greater or equal to every element of the algebra. The set 2Σ* of all formal languages (sets of finite strings) over an alphabet Σ forms an action algebra with 0 as the empty set, 1 = {ε}, ∨ as union, • as concatenation, L ← M as the set of all strings x such that xM ⊆ L (and dually for M → L), and L* as the set of all strings of strings in L (Kleene closure). The set 2X² of all binary relations on a set X forms an action algebra with 0 as the empty relation, 1 as the identity relation or equality, ∨ as union, • as relation composition, R ← S as the relation consisting of all pairs (x,y) such that for all z in X, ySz implies xRz (and dually for S → R), and R* as the reflexive transitive closure of R, defined as the union over all relations Rn for integers n ≥ 0. The two preceding examples are power sets, which are Boolean algebras under the usual set theoretic operations of union, intersection, and complement. This justifies calling them Boolean action algebras. The relational example constitutes a relation algebra equipped with an operation of reflexive transitive closure. Note that every Boolean algebra is a Heyting algebra and therefore an action algebra by virtue of being an instance of the first example.

It has been serialized by Kadokawa Shoten in the magazine Shōnen Ace from 2005 to 2010 and collected in twelve tankōbon volumes. The English version was then released digitally on BookWalker on October 29, 2014. A prequel anime series, Ga-Rei: Zero, aired from October 5, 2008 to December 21, 2008, which details the backstory of key characters Kagura and Yomi. Plot Kensuke Nimura is just your average high school student—except for the fact that he can see spirits. This ability generally hinders him more than it helps him, especially in trying to get a girlfriend. However, everything changes one day when he encounters Kagura Tsuchimiya while being pursued by evil spirits. They accidentally kiss and manage to destroy the source of energy that is drawing the evil spirits. A few days later, Kagura transfers into Kensuke's class, much to his surprise. Kagura is an agent of a government agency that secretly defends the public from supernatural enemies. She wields a Ga-rei, a \\"spirit devourer,\\" named Byakuei that she uses to fight. Kensuke's spiritual awareness and his attraction to Kagura compels him to follow her to the agency, where he is recruited to fight the supernatural. Their first enemy is Yomi Isayama, Kagura's former best friend, now an evil spirit due to a stone known as a sesshouseki embedded in her forehead. Also introduced is another old friend, the perverted Izuna Noriyuki. Yomi tries to release an ancient immortal demon sealed under Tokyo. The Agency manage to stop her after a long battle, resealing the demon and putting Yomi to rest in the process. A mysterious boy removes her sesshouseki and disappears. The next story arc concerns the re- emergence of the Juugondō organization and its heir, Shizuru Imawano. She encounters and alternatively threatens and flirts with Kensuke, angering Kagura. Soon, a contest begins between her and Kagura as to who can collect more sesshōseki, with Kensuke—and the Kyūbi-kitsune (or nine-tailed fox)—as the prize. The pressure is building as Kagura starts losing control of Byakuei and the Juugondō arrive in full force. Shockingly, Shizuru's long-lost sister Setsuna arrives, kills her father and takes over the Juugondō. She attacks and demolishes the Agency and the government try to distance themselves from the Agency for fear of revealing secrets to the public. Kagura, Kensuke, Kyouko and Iwahata survive and meet Izuna and Shizuru at an agency hideout. After resting, the group faces off against Setsuna inside Tamamo-no-Mae's garden, with Kagura as the winner. However, Kensuke was gravely injured in the battle, leading Kagura to use the power of the sesshōseki to save his life. As a result, she loses control and becomes the core of the newly created Kyūbi, destroying the center of Tokyo. Kensuke manages to reach the Kyūbi, using his new Michael Revolution sword to free Kagura. Due to her brief time as the Kyūbi's core, Kagura has suffered amnesia, much to everyone's shock. She and Kensuke resume their daily lives at school, but start investigating ghosts alongside Kensuke, Tanaka, and Izumi, a new student who bears a resemblance to Yomi. Investigations lead the group closer to Naraku, the area in Tokyo destroyed by the Kyūbi and now filled with spirits. Kensuke later meets Mikado and Tsuina from the Agency. A few days later, Kensuke and Izumi are attacked by Kirin, a black wolflike monster from Naraku, who cuts Kensuke's right eye. Izumi is later revealed to be Yomi, who has dissociative identity disorder, alternating between Yomi and Izumi. When the revived Agency imprisons Izumi with the intention of exorcising Yomi, which will likely kill Izumi as well, Kagura breaks her free and the two go on the run. Kagura resolves to defend Yomi, disregarding others' opinions. Fending evil spirits and eventually the escorts of the Black Priestess—Yomi—they are cornered on a snow-covered cliff. There, Kensuke and Tsuina arrive to save them, leading to Kagura completely regaining her memories. The ensuing ruckus causes the cliff to collapse, causing them to fall near Micheal Kohara's residence, where Izuna and Shizune find them unconscious. After recovering, Kensuke and the others learn of Earth's impending destruction at the Black Priestess's (Yomi) hands and the White Priestess's (Kagura) potential to stop it. While everyone recuperates from resulting disbelief, government agents arrive to efface them: Izuna sacrifices himself for Yomi, relieving his guilt at allowing her previous deaths. She retreats with her retainers, mired in sorrow and her miasma, despite Kagura's pleas. After resurrecting Izuna with an escort's soul, Yomi arrives at Tokyo's Naraku, releasing all her miasma and disrupting the Reimyaku. Consequently, this gives rise to Immortals and Narakus worldwide. Kagura, Micheal, Kensuke, Tsuina and Shizuru search for Yomi. Following clashes with the Tengu, Okama and a revived Kyūbi, they encounter Yomi and Izuna, now a corrupted soul like herself. During the battle the Black Priestess's Black Kirin (opposing the White Priestess's Byakuei, together they are yin & yang) breaks Byakuei's chains thus tearing apart both Byakuei and Kagura's souls. To save Kagura, Yomi melds with Kagura's soul after comprehending Kagura's devotion to her, as Byakuei dies. Izuna subsequently vanishes. Two years later, after the miasma clears and society rebuilds itself, Yomi, Kyouko, Kensuke, Kagura, and Izuna, a free-floating ghost, continue exorcism duties and live together, per Kensuke's suggestion. Mikado finally proposes to Tsuina. Terminology ; Sesshōseki : A stone made by the crystallization of the Nine-Tailed Fox's spiritual power when it was defeated hundreds of years ago. There are several spread all over the planet. As the power that they are made from is inherently evil, they tend to corrupt their user's minds and consume their bodies and minds, in return for limitless spirit power. Kagura possessed two in her earrings, while Kensuke had one (briefly) buried in his chest, near his heart. Kazuhiro appears to be their \\"keeper\\", as he gave one to Yomi and later took it away. They are the reason for Yomi's metamorphosis into an evil spirit and are extremely dangerous. : A person who possesses sesshōseki will have advanced regenerative abilities and may even be able to slow his/her aging, as demonstrated by Kazuhiro. ;Shikigami :Paper spirits used by Kyouko and other members of her family. They are made up of fuda, pieces of paper with incantations on them and can be used in several different ways, such as making them into paper giants or barriers. ; Hōjitsu : Spells, usually preceded by a lengthy Buddhist chant, that most spirit-users use to create a type of nature-related attack such as a lightning bolt. They are commonly used in conjunction with hand seals. ; : Taoist magic that was developed in the shadow of Onmyou and was later banned. Its practitioners were driven underground and reformed under the guise of a smuggling syndicate. They have since resurfaced. Shizuru and Setsuna are the daughters of the leader of Juugondo. ; Naraku : An area of Miasma created from the Kyuubi attack in Tokyo. All living beings within became spirits, though they did not all become evil. ;Supernatural Disaster Countermeasures Division (SDCD) :A government agency that fights the supernatural under the command of the Ministry of Environment. Formed after World War II, the agency has experience with fighting the supernatural, thanks to some of its members who are experts in dealing with it. The Division includes members of exorcist families, like Tsuchimiya and Isayama. Despite having hired such talented people into their ranks, the SDCD suffers from low manpower and as such have hired mercenaries or independent exorcists to help them in work especially in tough cases. ;Paranormal Disaster Countermeasure Headquarters (PDCH) :A special military unit under the Ministry of Defense. The PDCH was formed to help the SDCD fight against the supernatural yet at the same time prevent the MoE and SDCD from gaining too much power. Unlike the SDCD, the PDCH lack experts who deal with the supernatural, which they make up for it with more manpower and the latest technology in their fights. Due to the actions of Yomi Isayama, the PDCH was almost destroyed and suffered heavy losses in their ranks. It is hinted the PDCH became part of the SDCD when the latter was revived. Media Manga Ga-Rei was published by Kadokawa Shoten in the shōnen magazine Shōnen Ace and was collected in twelve tankōbon volumes. In addition, a single volume side-story manga titled Ga-rei: Tsuina no Shō was also published by Kadokawa Shoten in the shōnen magazine Shōnen Ace. In Europe, the series was licensed by Pika Édition for France, by Planet Manga for Italy and by Tokyopop for Germany. Kadokawa Shoten has then made the digital English version of the Manga available on BookWalker. Anime Ga- Rei: Zero is directed by Ei Aoki and animated by AIC Spirits and asread. The show is aired on AT-X, Chiba TV, KBS Kyoto, Sun TV, Tokyo MX TV, TV Aichi, TV Hokkaido, TV Kanagawa, TV Saitama and TVQ Kyushu Broadcasting Co., Ltd. The adaptation was announced on the promotional sleeve wrapper of Ga-rei's sixth volume regarding the green lighting of the show. A Ga-Rei: Zero television ad was soon aired to promote the show's upcoming release, followed by 30 second commercials that were on the Ga-Rei: Zero websites. Originally, it was announced that the anime would be an original story, suggesting that it had nothing to do with the manga except its setting: however, when the first episode aired, viewers were confused when the entire main cast was suddenly killed off. It was only later revealed in the second episode and still later in a radio interview with cast members Minoru Shiraishi, Kaoru Mizuhara & Minori Chihara, that the anime in fact tells the backstories of Yomi and Kagura before the events of the manga, thus making Ga-Rei: Zero a prequel to the original Ga-Rei series. Funimation Entertainment announced Ga-Rei: Zeros English license in August 2010 and released the series on Blu-ray and DVD in 2011. Funimation will stream the subtitled episodes on their video portal and YouTube channel. Live-Action series The Hollywood Reporter reported in October 2017 that Craig Kyle plans to adapt the manga into a live-action Hollywood TV series.

The head city is in La Cruz district. Toponymy The name of La Cruz translates to The Cross and dates back to the incident at the time when the mules carried the cattle from Nicaragua to Esparza, when one of them passing through the region fell dead because he pursued a cow that had escaped from the herd. This is why their peers placed a cross of sticks on his grave. Later, this cross served as a reference to the mules that went over there to make a break and also count the cattle, before continuing their journey to their final destination. Over time the site led to the formation of a burgeoning population, which began to be known as La Cruz.  History  La Cruz was created on 23 July 1969 by decree 4354. In Pre-Columbian times the area currently known as the canton de La Cruz, was part of a province of the Indians called Chorotegas whose domains ranged from the Nicoya Peninsula to Lake Nicaragua, made up of several villages or domains. The region was discovered by Don Gil Gonzalez Davila in 1522, on their march to another province of the Chorotegas, which was under the authority of the chief of the Nicarao people (in the territory now known as Nicaragua). In 1561 Don Juan de Cavallon from Granada passed through this area in his expedition to reach the Central Valley. In September 1562 Juan Vásquez de Coronado passed by this area too, who brought cattle and horses from León. He also went through the region of Perafán de Ribera in his journey towards Cartago. In the second half of the nineteenth century, the first farmers from Rivas, Nicaragua came to this region, beginning the formation of ranches. On March 20, 1856, our troops fought their first battle against the filibusters of William Walker in the Hacienda Santa Rosa, and succeeded in defeating the invaders. In the government administration of Ascensión Esquivel Ibarra, in 1906 the school was located fifty meters east of the existing lookout built by the Instituto Costarricense de Turismo (National Tourism Chamber). In 1953, a new school was built called Salvador Villar Muñoz. The college named Liceo La Cruz began teaching in 1969, the government of José Joaquín Trejos Fernández as a supplementary educational secondary school, at first in the day and then at night, located at the school, in 1973 opened the current premises. Law No. 20, the 18th of October 1915, was enacted in the territorial division for administrative purposes, in which La Cruz was the third district of Liberia's canton. The first chapel was built in 1923, located at the northeast corner of the existing park. During the time of archbishop Monsignor Víctor Manuel Sanabria Martínez, second Archbishop of Costa Rica, in 1949, the parish was erected, with devotion to the Holy Cross, which is currently suffrage of the Diocese of Tilarán of the Ecclesiastical Province of Costa Rica. The pipe was opened in the year 1946, in the administration of former president Teodoro Picado Michalski. In the government of José Joaquín Trejos Fernández, on July 23, 1969, law No. 4354, was granted the title of Villa of the town of La Cruz, head of canton set up with that purpose. Later, in Act No. 4574 of May 4, 1970, promulgated the Municipal Code, third article, that confirmed that this villa was now a City because of being head of the canton. On August 10, 1970 was held the first meeting of the Council of La Cruz, composed of the following owners: Piedad Loáiciga Salgado, President: Victor Manuel Hernandez Ortega, Vice President: Carlos Manuel Rodriguez Campos. The Municipal Executive was Sancho Felix Gallo and the City Clerk: Jose Luis Fallas Leitón.  Geography  La Cruz has an area of km² and a mean elevation of metres.  Districts  The canton of La Cruz is subdivided into the following districts: # La Cruz # Santa Cecilia # Garita # Santa Elena  Demographics  For the 2011 census, La Cruz had a population of inhabitants.  Transportation   Road transportation  The canton is covered by the following road routes: Economy Approximately 72% of its economically active population worked in livestock, agriculture and fisheries. Its further development was due to the opening of the Interamericana Street. The trade of Costa Rica with the rest of Central America has led the increase in the passage of vehicles to be bound by crossing La Cruz, encouraging them to people. The development of tourism in the region has generously helped the people of this canton, as many work in informal trade activities; others have turned their houses into small hotels and sodas. The arrival of tourists (domestic and foreign) to the beaches of the canton has been growing steadily, generating demand for luxury hotels and homes that have been developed across the coastal zone. The lack of appropriate places of healthy amusement leads to the consumption of beer, making alcoholism one of the major ills afflicting the canton. The limit is set by dividing the Guanacaste Volcanic Mountain Range, where the Orosi Volcano is located which gives a beautiful faraway view from the Bolaños Bay area. La Cruz is a small city that offers all the basic services and is located 45 minutes from Liberia which is the biggest city in Guanacaste.

Low- copper amalgam commonly consists of mercury (50%), silver (~22–32%), tin (~14%), zinc (~8%) and other trace metals. Dental amalgams were first documented in a Tang Dynasty medical text written by Su Gong (苏恭) in 659, and appeared in Germany in 1528. In the 1800s, amalgam became the dental restorative material of choice due to its low cost, ease of application, strength, and durability. In July 2018 the EU prohibited amalgam for dental treatment of children under 15 years and of pregnant or breastfeeding women.  History of use  There are, according to Geir Bjørklund, indications that dental amalgam was used in the first part of the Tang Dynasty in China (AD 618–907), and in Germany by Strockerus in about 1528. Evidence of a dental amalgam first appears in the Tang Dynasty medical text Xinxiu bencao《新修本草》 written by Su Gong (苏恭) in 659, manufactured from tin and silver. Historical records hint that the use of amalgams may date to even earlier in the Tang Dynasty. It was during the Ming Dynasty that the composition of an early dental amalgam was first published, and a text written by Liu Wentai in 1505 states that it consists of \\"100 shares of mercury, 45 shares of silver and 900 shares of tin.\\" Ever since its introduction in the Western world in the 1830s, amalgam has been the subject of recurrent controversies because of its mercury content. Early amalgam was made by mixing mercury with the filings of silver coins. In 1833 Englishmen, Edward Crawcour and his nephew Moses Crawcour (incorrectly referred to as \\"the Crawcour brothers\\"), brought amalgam to the United States, and in 1844 it was reported that fifty percent of all dental restorations placed in upstate New York consisted of amalgam. However, at that point the use of dental amalgam was declared to be malpractice, and the American Society of Dental Surgeons (ASDS), the only US dental association at the time, forced all of its members to sign a pledge to abstain from using the mercury fillings.American Society of Dental Surgeons. (1845). American Journal of Dental Science. Harvard University. p. 170. This was the beginning of what is known as the first dental amalgam war. The dispute ended in 1856 with the disbanding of the old association. The American Dental Association (ADA) was founded in its place in 1859, which has since then strongly defended dental amalgam from allegations of being too risky from the health standpoint.Bremner MDF. (1939). The Story of Dentistry from the Dawn of Civilization to the Present Dental Items of Interest Pub. Co. p 86–87  Low copper to high copper amalgam alloy  Amalgam has been used for many years for restorations, commonly known as fillings. Prior to 1900 many compositions were tried but few were successful when placed in the oral environment. Around 1900, small amounts of copper and occasionally zinc were added. Zinc acts as a scavenger because it prevents oxidation of the other metals in the alloy during the manufacturing process. Zinc accomplishes this by combining readily with oxygen to form zinc oxide. Amalgam restorations made from this balanced formula were reasonably successful and its longevity increased. However, one disadvantage that remained was fracture at the tooth-amalgam interface commonly called marginal fracture. Sn8Hg (γ2 phase) was considered to be responsible for this problem. This phase has been shown to be the weakest phase in the set amalgam and is subject to corrosion, particularly at the tooth-amalgam interface. In 1962 a new amalgam alloy, called Dispersalloy, was introduced with the addition of a spherical silver-copper eutectic particle to the traditional lathe-cut Ag3Sn particle in a ratio of 1:2. The mixture of these two types of particles is known as admix alloy. This alloy strengthened the set amalgam and reduced the γ2 phase (Sn8Hg). The increased copper in the silver-copper eutectic reacted preferentially with tin so that Sn8Hg could not form. Early results from the clinical use of this new amalgam showed an improvement in marginal integrity. About 10 years later, another alloy, called Tytin, was introduced by adding significant amount of Cu3Sn together with Ag3Sn, in the form of a unicompositional spherical particle to eliminate the γ2 phase. Both of these relatively new alloys raised the copper content from 5%, present in the older balanced composition alloy, to about 13% for the newer alloys.  Composition  Dental amalgam is produced by mixing liquid mercury with an alloy made of silver, tin, and copper solid particles. Small quantities of zinc, mercury and other metals may be present in some alloys. This combination of solid particles is known as amalgam alloy. The composition of the alloy particles are controlled by the ISO Standard (ISO 1559) for dental amalgam alloy in order to control properties of set amalgam such as corrosion and setting expansion. It is important to differentiate between dental amalgam and the amalgam alloy that is commercially produced and marketed as small filings, spheroid particles, or a combination of these, suitable for mixing with liquid mercury to produce the dental amalgam. Amalgam is used most commonly for direct, permanent, posterior restorations and for large foundation restorations, or cores, which are precursors to placing crowns. The reaction between mercury and alloy when mixed together is termed an amalgamation reaction.Bonsor, S., Pearson, G., & Dawson Books. (2013). A clinical guide to applied dental materials. Amsterdam : London :: Churchill Livingstone. It will result in the formation of a silver-grey workable mass which can be condensed into cavities. After condensing, the dental amalgam is carved to generate the required anatomical features and then hardens with time. The standard composition of alloy prior to 1986 is referred to as conventional amalgam alloy. More recently (post-1986), there has been a change in the compositional standard of the alloy due to better understanding of structure-property relationships for the materials. Conventional amalgam alloy commonly consists of silver (~65% ), tin (~29%), copper (~8%) and other trace metals; current amalgam alloy consists of silver (40%), tin (32%), copper (30%) and other metals.  Metallurgy of amalgam  To fabricate an amalgam filling, the dentist uses a mixing device to blend roughly equal parts (by mass) of shavings of a silver-base alloy with mercury until the shavings are thoroughly wetted. The silver alloy is typically 40–70% Ag, 25-29% Sn, 2–40% Cu and 0–2% Zn (when the alloy is formulated. Zn is a scavenger and is mostly consumed during melting and lost as oxide). The dentist packs the plastic mass, before it sets, into the cavity. The amalgam expands ≈0.1% over 6–8 hours on setting. The final structure is a metal matrix composite, where γ1, η and γ2 phases, are a matrix for unreacted original alloy, minus the fast- reacting β-phase and excess Sn.  Properties of amalgam  Amalgam is a mixture of two or more metals (alloy) with mercury which has been purified first by distillation to remove impurities. Currently, major components of the alloy are silver, tin, and copper. The composition of the alloy powder is controlled by ISO standard for dental amalgam alloy (ISO 1559) to control the properties of amalgam.  Plastic deformation (creep)  Creep or plastic deformation happens when subjected to intra-oral stresses such as chewing or grinding. Creep causes the amalgam to flow and protrudes from the margin of the cavity forming unsupported edges. ‘Ditch’ is formed around the margins of the amalgam restoration after fracture due to amalgam creep at the occlusal margins. The γ2 phase of amalgam is primarily responsible for high values of creep.  Corrosion  Corrosion occurs when an anode and cathode are set up in the presence of electrolytes, creating an electrolytic cell. The multiphase structure of dental amalgam can contribute as an anode or cathode with saliva as electrolytes. Corrosion may significantly affect the structure and mechanical properties of set dental amalgam. In conventional amalgam, γ2 phase is the most reactive and readily forms an anode. It will break down releasing corrosion products and mercury. Some of the mercury will combine rapidly with unreacted alloy and some will be ingested. The chances of ditching are further increased. Copper-enriched amalgams contain little or no γ2 phase. The copper–tin phase, which replaces γ2 in these materials, is still the most corrosion-prone phase in the amalgam. The corrosion however is still much lower than conventional amalgam. In spite of that, it is thought that corrosion actually offers a clinical advantage. The corrosion products will gather at the tooth-amalgam interface and fill the microgap (marginal gap) which helps to decrease microleakage. Even so, there are no reports of increased marginal leakage for the copper-enriched amalgams indicating that sufficient quantities of corrosion product are produced to seal the margins. Microleakage is the leakage of minute amounts of fluids, debris, and microorganisms through the microscopic space between a dental restoration and the adjacent surface of the cavity preparation. Microleakage can risk recurrent caries.  Strength  An amalgam restoration develops its strength slowly and may take up to 24 hours or longer to reach a reasonably high value. At the time when the patient is dismissed from the surgery, typically some 15–20 minutes after placing the filling, the amalgam is relatively weak. Therefore, dentists need to instruct patients not to apply undue stress to their freshly placed amalgam fillings. In addition, amalgam restorations are brittle and susceptible to corrosion.  Amalgam's setting reaction  :γ : Ag3Sn (mechanically the strongest) :γ1 : Ag2Hg3 (major matrix phase in set amalgam) :γ2 : Sn8Hg (weakest phase, corrodes easily) :β : Ag5Sn :η' : Cu6Sn5 :ε : Cu3Sn The alloys are broadly classified as low-copper (5% or less copper) and high-copper alloys (13% to 30% copper). The solid particles of the alloy are either spherical or irregularly shaped microspheres of various sizes or a combination of the two. The low-copper alloys have either irregular or spherical particles. High-copper alloys contain either spherical particles of the same composition (unicompositional) or a mixture of irregular and spherical particles of different or the same composition (admixed). The properties of set amalgam depends upon the alloy composition—particle size, shape and distribution—and heat treatment control the characteristic properties of the amalgam.  Low copper alloy  During trituration, mercury diffuses into the silver-tin particles. Then, silver and tin dissolve, to a very limited extent, into the mercury. As this occurs, the particles become smaller. Because the solubility of both silver and tin in mercury is limited and because silver is much less soluble in mercury than is tin, silver precipitates out first as silver-mercury (γ1) followed by tin in the form of tin-mercury (γ2). The set amalgam consists of unreacted gamma particles surrounded by a matrix of gamma 1 and gamma 2. The amalgamation is summarised as follows: Ag3Sn, Ag5Sn + Hg → Ag2Hg3 \\\\+ Sn8Hg + Ag3Sn i.e. (γ + β) + Hg → γ1 \\\\+ γ2 + γ  High copper alloy In high copper alloy, copper is added to improve mechanical properties, resistance to corrosion and marginal integrity. The higher copper is supplied by either the silver-copper eutectic or the Cu3Sn (ε) phase. The fact that tin had a greater affinity for copper than for mercury meant that the gamma-2 phase was reduced or eliminated. This resulted in the dramatic improvement in physical properties. The higher copper content is supplied as two types: # High copper admix alloy (spherical particles of the silver-copper eutectic alloy to a low-copper lathe-cut alloy in a ratio of 1:2) # Uni/single-composition alloy  Admix alloy setting reaction  During trituration, the dissolved silver from the silver-tin particles reacts, as in low copper alloys, to form the γ1 phase. The dissolved tin migrates to the outside of the silver-copper particles to form Cu6Sn5, the eta prime (η′) phase of the copper-tin system. Thus, copper reacts with sufficient copper to prevent the formation of γ2. The amalgamation reaction may be simplified as follows (notice the absence of γ2 phase) : γ(Ag3Sn) + Ag-Cu (eutectic) + Hg → γ1 (Ag2Hg3)+ η ′ (Cu6Sn5)+ unreacted γ (Ag3Sn) + unreacted Ag-Cu (eutectic)  Uni/single composition alloy  Here, the alloy particles contain both Ag3Sn(γ) and Cu3Sn(ε), similar to the low-copper lathe-cut alloys, but with much greater amount of the Cu3Sn(ε) phase. These alloys are usually spherical. When liquid mercury is mixed with these alloys, it diffuses into the surface of these particles forming Ag2Hg3 as well as Cu6Sn5. γ(Ag3Sn) + ɛ(Cu3Sn) + Hg → γ1 (Ag2Hg3) + η ′ (Cu6Sn5) + unreacted [γ (Ag3Sn)+ ɛ (Cu3Sn )] The difference in eta prime phase of admixed alloy and unicomposition alloy is that in unicomposition alloy, Cu6Sn5 crystals are much larger and rod-shaped than those in admixed alloy. Copper added in unicomposition causes removal of gamma2 phase.  Advantages of high copper compared to low copper alloy  # Better corrosion resistance. # Less susceptible to creep. # Greater strength. # Less tarnish and corrosion. # Greater longevity.Guthrow CE, Johnson LB, Lawless KR \\"Corrosion of dental amalgam and its component phases.\\" J Dent Res. 1967 Nov-Dec; 46(6):1372-81.  Amalgam vs. polymer resins  Amalgam is tolerant to a wide range of clinical placement conditions and moderately tolerant to the presence of moisture during placement. In contrast, the techniques for composite resin placement are more sensitive to many factors. Mercury has properties of a bacteriostatic agent whereas certain methacrylate polymers (for example TEGMA, triethylene glycol methacrylate) composing the matrix of resin composites \\"encourages the growth of microorganisms\\". In the Casa Pia study in Portugal (1986–1989), 1,748 posterior restorations were placed and 177 (10.1%) of them failed during the course of the study. Recurrent marginal decay was the main reason for failure in both amalgam and composite restorations, accounting for 66% (32/48) and 88% (113/129), respectively. Polymerization shrinkage, the shrinkage that occurs during the composite curing process, has been implicated as the primary reason for postoperative marginal leakage. However, there is low-quality evidence to suggest that resin composites lead to higher failure rates and risk of secondary caries than amalgam restorations. Several reviews have been made by using database in the Cochrane Library where randomized controlled trials of few studies comparing dental resin composite with dental amalgams in permanent posterior teeth were compared. This review supports the fact that amalgam restorations are particularly useful and successful in parts of the world where amalgam is still the material of choice to restore posterior teeth with proximal caries. Though, there is insufficient evidence to support or refute any adverse effects amalgam may have on patients, new research is unlikely to change opinion on its safety and due to the decision for a global phase-down of amalgam (Minamata Convention on Mercury) general opinion on its safety is unlikely to change. These are some of the reasons why amalgam has remained a superior restorative material over resin-base composites. The New England Children's Amalgam Trial (NECAT), a randomized controlled trial, yielded results \\"consistent with previous reports suggesting that the longevity of amalgam is higher than that of resin-based compomer in primary teeth and composites in permanent teeth. Compomers were seven times as likely to require replacement and composites were seven times as likely to require repair. There are circumstances in which composite serves better than amalgam. For example, when a more conservative preparation would be beneficial, composite is the recommended restorative material. These situations would include small occlusal restorations, in which amalgam would require the removal of more sound tooth structure, as well as in \\"enamel sites beyond the height of contour\\". For cosmetic purposes, composite is preferred when a restoration is required on an immediately visible portion of a tooth.  Bonded amalgam  Dental amalgam does not by itself bond to tooth structure. This was recognized as a shortcoming by early practitioners such as Baldwin. He recommended that the prepared cavity be coated with zinc phosphate cement just prior to filling with amalgam, in order to improve the seal and retention. The practice did not become universally accepted and eventually fell into disuse. Until the 1980s, most amalgam restorations placed worldwide were done without adhesives, although in the 1970s a polycarboxylate-based adhesive liner was formulated specifically for this purpose In the mid-1980s the first reports of the use of resins to bond amalgam to etched tooth structure, much like is done for composite resins, appeared in the literature. Since then, a number of papers have been published on laboratory as well as clinical studies of the technique. For large cavity restorations, features such as pins, slots, holes and grooves can be used for the retention of large amalgam restorations, but they do not reinforce the amalgam or increase its strength. There is no current scientific evidence to justify the extra cost and effort associated with the use of adhesively bonded amalgam restorations in comparison with nonbonded amalgam restorations. In view of the lack of evidence on the additional benefit of adhesively bonding amalgam compared with nonbonded amalgam, it is important that clinicians are mindful of the additional costs that may be incurred. Liners and bases The placement of amalgam restorations can potentially cause sensitivity post-operatively. According to R. Weiner, a protective layer or liner should be placed prior to the placement of amalgam to act as a buffer, helping to reduce sensitivity to the tooth. There are different liners that can be used in dental practices today, many of which contain zinc. Examples of lining materials include zinc oxide eugenol, zinc phosphate, glass ionomer cement, zinc poly-carboxylate and resin.  Sealing amalgam restorations  A varnish can be applied to the cavity wall to provide a good marginal seal. The varnish should be insoluble in water and is usually composed of a resin in a volatile solvent. When applied to the cavity, the solvent evaporates, leaving the resin behind to seal the dentinal tubules. The amalgam can then be packed into the cavity.  Dental amalgam toxicity  Concerns have been raised about the potential for mercury poisoning with dental amalgam when used in a dental filling. Major health and professional organizations regard amalgam as safe but questions have been raised and acute but rare allergic reactions have been reported. Critics argue that it has toxic effects that make it unsafe, both for the patient and perhaps even more so for the dental professional manipulating it during a restoration. A study by the Life Sciences Research Office found that studies on mercury vapor and dental amalgam \\"provided insufficient information to enable definitive conclusions.\\" They identified several \\"research gaps\\", including: \\"well- controlled studies using standardized measures that evaluate whether low level [mercury vapor exposures] produce neurotoxic and/or neuropsychological effect\\", studies on \\"co-exposure to HgO and methylmercury\\", studies on \\"in utero exposure to HgO\\", \\"occupational studies on [pregnant workers] with well- defined HgO exposure\\", studies on the absorption of Hg2+ by the \\"human neonatal gut from breast milk\\", studies on \\"whether dental professionals have increased incidences of kidney disease, emotional instability, erethrism, pulmonary dysfunction, or other characteristics of occupational HgO exposure\\", studies on whether there exist \\"potential gender differences\\" or \\"genetic basis for sensitivity to mercury exposure.\\" The removal of amalgam fillings is not recommended for reasons other than a true hypersensitivity to mercury. Mercury levels in blood and urine have been shown to rise for a short period of time following the removal of amalgam restorations and no studies have demonstrated any health gain from restoration removal. Removal involves exposure to mercury vapor released during the removal process. Amalgams also contribute to mercury toxicity in the environment. With regard to amalgam placement and removal in pregnancy, research has not shown any adverse effects for the mother or fetus. However, research is inadequate to determine the chance of harm occurring and therefore placement and removal should be avoided during pregnancy if possible. In response to The Minamata Convention on Mercury, the European Commission has confirmed its position that individual nations should work to gradually scale down the use of dental amalgam.  Environmental impact and prevention of amalgam poisoning  Dental amalgam is thought to be relatively safe to be used as a restorative material as it is used in low doses. Amalgam vapour can be released through chewing but this is minimal. However, there is an increased release of mercury following the exposure of electromagnetic fields generated by MRI machines. Some patients may develop allergic reactions to it. Resin composite, glass ionomer cements and ceramic or gold inlays can be used as alternatives to amalgam.  U.S. amalgam disposal regulation  Amalgam separator In the United States, dental offices have typically disposed of amalgam waste down the drain. The wastewater is sent to the local sewage treatment plant, which is not designed to treat or recycle mercury or other heavy metals. The mercury contaminates the sludge processed at the treatment plant, and thereby can spread the mercury in surrounding communities, if the sludge is land-applied for disposal. Dental amalgam is the largest source of mercury received by U.S. treatment plants. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) promulgated an effluent guidelines regulation in 2017 which prohibits most dental practices from disposing dental amalgam waste down the drain. Most dental offices in the U.S. are required to use an amalgam separator in their drain system. The separator captures the waste material, which is then recycled.EPA (2017-06-14). \\"Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards for the Dental Category.\\" Federal Register,  EU amalgam disposal regulation  The European Commission has issued a Waste Directive that classifies amalgam waste as a hazardous waste. The waste should be separated from other waste by fitting amalgam separators in all dental practices.  Avoidance in pregnant women  Mercury can cross the placenta leading to stillbirths and birth defects. A combination of mercury and non-ionizing radiation has been suggested as a factor in the recent increase in reported autism spectrum disorders. It has been reported that there is a positive correlation between the maternal and cord blood mercury levels. Although there is no evidence linking amalgam use and pregnancy damage, it is advisable to delay or avoid dealing with amalgam fillings in pregnant patients.  Awareness among dentists  The dental operating team should deal with amalgam with proper use of personal protective equipment to protect themselves.

Austin persisted in the introduction of then-modern theater and modern design and especially contemporaneous art. Salvador Dalí, Alexander Calder, and Gertrude Stein benefited from his advocacy.  Early life  Austin was born in Brookline, Massachusetts, attended Noble and Greenough School near Boston and Phillips Academy, Andover, before entering Harvard College in the Class of 1922. He interrupted his undergraduate career to work in Egypt and the Sudan (1922-1923) with the Harvard University/Boston Museum of Fine Arts archaeological expedition under George A. Reisner, then the leading American Egyptologist. After taking his degree in 1924, he became a graduate student in Harvard's fine arts department, where he served for three years as chief graduate assistant to Edward W. Forbes, Director of the Fogg Art Museum. He was a first-cousin of the American artist Stephen Etnier.  Hartford  Avery Memorial Austin was appointed director of the Wadsworth Atheneum at the age of 26, and simultaneously joined the staff of Trinity College, Hartford, where he founded the fine arts department and taught throughout his tenure while director of the Wadsworth. In 1929, Austin married Helen Goodwin in Paris. The Goodwins were among the founders of Hartford, and related to and closely allied with the family of Hartford-born J. Pierpont Morgan, one of the Wadsworth Atheneum's great benefactors. Austin produced America's first comprehensive exhibitions of Italian Baroque painting (1930), surrealism (1931), and Pablo Picasso's works (1934). The Picasso show formed part of the opening of a new wing, the Avery Memorial, largely designed by Austin himself (with Morris & O'Connor of New York City) and which boasted the first International style museum interior in the United States. At that time, Austin also inaugurated the Avery Theater (now Aetna Theater), one of the first theaters in an American art museum, with the premiere of the opera Four Saints in Three Acts by Gertrude Stein and Virgil Thomson. In 1928 Austin founded The Friends and Enemies of Modern Music, a society that sponsored premieres or early performances of works by composers such as Igor Stravinsky, Charles Ives, Erik Satie, and Virgil Thomson, as well as Vivaldi, Scarlatti, and Couperin (played on period instruments). The 1936 American premiere of Satie's symphonic drama Socrate, for example, featured one of Alexander Calder's early mobiles. An innovation begun in 1929 was the showing of motion pictures (foreign, experimental, and Hollywood) seven years before films were shown at the Museum of Modern Art. The most far-reaching of Austin's theatrical ventures was the Wadsworth Atheneum's sponsorship, at Lincoln Kirstein's request, of choreographer George Balanchine's immigration to the United States in 1933, originally to found the School of American Ballet in Hartford.  Ringling Museum  Austin was also a member of the International Brotherhood of Magicians. Later in life, he was the first director of the John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art. He was instrumental in bringing the Asolo Theater, first constructed in 1798 in Asolo, Italy by Antonio Locatelli, to the museum.  Later years  Austin died of lung cancer in Hartford, Connecticut on March 29, 1957, at the age of 56.  Austin House  A. Everett Austin House, the West End home Chick Austin built in 1930 after seeing the Palladian Villas of the Veneto on his honeymoon, is a National Historic Landmark.

The 47th district encompasses all of Lewis County, most of Oneida County, and parts of St. Lawrence County. Prior to his election to the Senate, Griffo served as Mayor of Rome, New York and as Oneida County Executive. A Republican, Griffo serves as Deputy Minority Leader of the State Senate. Early life and family Joseph Griffo was born to Joseph and Betty Griffo in Rome, New York. Griffo went through the Rome public school system and graduated from Rome Free Academy High School in 1974. He then went on to the State University of New York at Brockport, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science, magna cum laude, in 1978. Griffo is married to Lorraine Griffo. Political career Oneida County Legislature: 1989-1991 Griffo served in the Oneida County Legislature from 1989 to 1991. Mayor of Rome: 1992-2003 Griffo was elected mayor of his hometown of Rome, NY in 1991, and won two subsequent elections in 1995 and 1999. As Mayor, Griffo eliminated Rome's special one-quarter percent sales tax. (accessed 6/20/09) Also, Griffo \\"was able to prevent a tax hike there (Rome) in all but one of his years in office, despite the crippling loss of Griffiss Air Force Base in 1993 - perhaps the worst single economic blow the county has ever seen.\\" Griffo merged the parks and recreation departments and handed over the city's weights and measures and emergency management departments to the county, resulting in savings. To prevent closures and service cuts, he privatized Rome Hospital, the Erie Canal Village, and city trash collection services. Griffo brought Woodstock 1999 to Rome; this effort earned him the nickname \\"The Rock N' Roll Mayor.\\" The concert was held at the deserted Griffiss Air Force Base and served as a precedent to using the space for future concerts and events. Woodstock '99 attracted over 200,000 people. As the crowd got out of control, state troopers and local police dispersed the crowd without further incident. Oneida County Executive: 2003-2006 Griffo was appointed Oneida County Executive in June 2003 to serve out the term of his predecessor. Griffo was then elected to the post in November 2003. After raising taxes 16% for 2003, his predecessor had announced that taxes for 2004 might need to be raised by as much as 26% due to skyrocketing Medicare costs and retirement benefits. However, after Griffo was appointed County Executive, he was able to balance the 2004 budget while raising taxes by 2.9%. In 2005, he implemented a prescription drug plan that cut drug costs for Oneida county residents by up to 38%. (accessed 6/21/09) Griffo increased the county sales tax 1.5% in the 2005 budget to cover Medicaid costs. Normally, sales tax revenues are split amongst state, county and townships/cities. However, in order to cover mandated Medicaid costs, the 1.5% increase would all go to the county government. Utica Mayor Tim Julian began claiming a share of the revenues. Griffo remained adamant in refusing to split the revenues. Griffo tried to disarm the situation by offering the city of Utica $800,000 in debt forgiveness, which Julian refused. Griffo eventually won out and the county did not split the extra sales tax revenues with Utica. Griffo helped stop the New York Regional Interconnect (NYRI) plan to run electricity from Canada through Oneida County. Concerned citizens feared the project would increase electricity costs in the area and pose health and safety risks to residents. (accessed 6/22/09) A grassroots effort formed opposing the plan, and Griffo supported that effort with $50,000 of county money. New York State Senator: 2007-present In 2006, Griffo ran for State Senate. Utica Mayor Tim Julian ran against Griffo in the Republican primary for State Senator. While Julian lost the primary, he secured a spot on the Independence Party ticket and continued his campaign. A week before the election, Julian dropped out of the race. Griffo was elected in 2006 to represent the 47th district in the New York State Senate. He replaced Raymond Meier, who instead ran for Congress that year. Among Griffo's significant legislation was a law that created the website ResultsNY.gov where anyone could log on and see how state funds were being used. Griffo also proposed bills that would create term limits for the Governor, Comptroller and Attorney-General as well as forcing vacancies at statewide positions to be filled through popular election rather than appointment by the Governor. \\"His bills have included child abuse victim protection, a law to keep snowmobile fees for trail system use and legislation capping assessment increases for farmers.\\" Griffo voted against same-sex marriage legislation on December 2, 2009; the bill was defeated. In 2011, he voted against the Marriage Equality Act, which the Senate passed 33-29.http://open.nysenate.gov/legislation/bill/a8354-2011 Marriage Equality Act and roll call On January 3, 2017, Griffo drew media attention for a sharp and contentious Twitter exchange with Melissa DeRosa, Chief of Staff to New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo. In December 2018, Griffo was appointed Deputy Minority Leader of the State Senate. In January 2019, he was appointed Acting Minority Leader after Minority Leader John J. Flanagan sought treatment for alcoholism. Legal difficulties Griffo was arrested on August 1, 1988 after allegedly serving alcohol or permitting alcohol to be served to minors at a party he hosted. His case was discharged under contemplation of dismissal. After his arrest, Griffo accused the officer who arrested him of being 'disgruntled', despite the Rome Police having legitimate grounds for an arrest. Later the Rome Democratic Party hired attorney Robert Abrams to probe into Rome Judge James Kehoe's disposition of charges against Joseph Griffo. Griffo was involved in a two-vehicle collision on East Oak Street in Rome. Police said the state senator caused the crash at the stop sign intersection at North James Street. The young female victim in the other car complained of shoulder pain, was later taken to Rome Memorial Hospital by a family member, police stated. The report said that Griffo \\"has a physical disability causing loss of vision in his right eye, which may have been a contributing factor\\" in the accident. Griffo \\"was determined to be at fault in regards to this collision,\\" the report said, but he was not ticketed. References External links *New York State Senate: Joseph A.

Georgi did indeed compose songs, a ballet, a cantata, two symphonic poems, and a variety of other instrumental works. None of these have entered the international repertoire, and Georgi ultimately became more and more immersed in musical academics, formulating an abstruse system he called \\"metro-techtonic analysis\\" for the scientific measurement of symmetry in musical forms.

Fossum (born October 17, 1957) is an American physicist and engineer known for developing the CMOS image sensor.B. Stern, Inventors at Work, Apress 2012. He is currently a professor at Thayer School of Engineering in Dartmouth College.  Early years and education  Fossum was born and raised in Simsbury, Connecticut and attended public school there. He also spent Saturdays at the Talcott Mountain Science Center in Avon CT which he credits for his lifelong interest in science, engineering and mentoring students. He received his B.S. in physics and engineering from Trinity College in 1979 and his Ph.D. in electrical engineering from Yale University in 1984. Academic career  Eric R. Fossum was a member of the Electrical Engineering faculty at Columbia University from 1984 to 1990. At Columbia University, he and his students performed research on CCD focal-plane image processing and high speed III-V CCDs. In 1990, Dr. Fossum joined the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology and managed JPL’s image sensor and focal- plane technology research and advanced development. In 2007 he sponsored, in part, the Trinity College Fire-Fighting Robot Contest, aimed at increasing innovation and invention in the world of robotics. He joined the Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth in 2010 where he teaches, performs research on the Quanta Image Sensor with his graduate students, and coordinates the Ph.D. Innovation Program. Invention While Fossum was at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), then-NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin invoked a plan of \\"Faster, Better, Cheaper\\" for NASA Space Science missions. One of the instrument goals was to miniaturize charge-coupled device (CCD) camera systems onboard interplanetary spacecraft. In response, throughout the early 1990s, Fossum developed a new CMOS active-pixel sensor (APS) with intra-pixel charge transfer camera-on-a-chip technology, now just called the CMOS Image Sensor or CISB. Stern, _Inventors at Work_ , Apress 2012.e.g. US Patents 5,471,515 and 5,841,126 He developed a CMOS sensor with his team at JPL in 1993. The same year, he published an extensive paper broadly defining the active-pixel sensor (APS) and giving a historical overview of the technology. He largely credits the invention of APS technology to the Japanese companies Olympus and Toshiba during the mid-to-late 1980s, noting the former developed the vertical APS structure with NMOS transistors and the latter developed the lateral APS structure with PMOS transistors. His team at JPL were the first to fabricate a practical APS outside of Japan, while making several key improvements to APS technology. The JPL sensor used a lateral APS structure similar to the Toshiba sensor, but was fabricated with CMOS (complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor) transistors rather than PMOS transistors. This made JPL's APS device the first CMOS sensor with intra-pixel charge transfer. In 1994, Fossum proposed an improvement to the CMOS sensor: the integration of the pinned photodiode (PPD). A CMOS sensor with PPD technology was first fabricated in 1995 by a joint JPL and Kodak team that included Fossum along with P.P.K. Lee, R.C. Gee, R.M. Guidash and T.H. Lee. Further refinements to the CMOS sensor with PPD technology between 1997 and 2003 led to CMOS sensors achieve imaging performance on par with CCD sensors, and later exceeding CCD sensors. As part of Goldin's directive to transfer space technology to the public sector whenever possible, Fossum led the CMOS APS development and subsequent transfer of the technology to US industry, including Eastman Kodak, AT&T; Bell Labs, National Semiconductor and others. Despite initial skepticism by entrenched CCD manufacturers, the CMOS image sensor technology is now used in almost all cell-phone cameras, many medical applications such as capsule endoscopy and dental x-ray systems, scientific imaging, automotive safety systems, DSLR digital cameras and many other applications. Over 6 billion cameras are manufactured each year using CMOS technology. Entrepreneur In 1995, frustrated by the slow pace of the technology's adoption, he and then-wife Dr. Sabrina Kemeny co-founded Photobit Corporation to commercialize the technology. He joined as Chairman of the Board and Chief Scientist in 1996 and became CEO of Photobit Technology Corporation in 2000. In late 2001, Micron Technology Inc. acquired Photobit and Dr. Fossum was named a Senior Micron Fellow. He left Micron in 2003. In 2005, he joined SiWave Inc., a developer of MEMS technology for mobile phone handsets, as CEO. SiWave was renamed Siimpel and grew substantially before his departure in 2007. Siimpel was later acquired by Tessera. In 1986 he founded the IEEE Workshop on CCDS, now known as the International Image Sensor Workshop (IISW). He co-founded and was the first President of the International Image Sensor Society (IISS) which operates the IISW.  Achievements and awards  Eric R. Fossum has published over 300 technical papers,See Google Scholar and holds more than 170 U.S. patents.USPTO Search 2020 He is a Fellow member of the IEEE.

This is a species of open drier deciduous woodland and second growth. It is absent from evergreen rainforests and semidesert areas. Description Showing emerald spots Mkhuze Game Reserve, KwaZulu-Natal Emerald-spotted wood dove is a small plump pigeon, typically 20 cm in length. Its back, hindneck, wings and tail are pale grey brown, and the folded wings have green metallic patches. There are blackish bands on the lower back and tail. The forehead, crown and nape are bluish grey, fading to pinkish grey on the throat. The underparts are mauve-pink, becoming whiter on the belly. The bill of this dove is blackish with a red base. The sexes are similar, but the female may be slightly duller than the male. The immature has duller green spots and buff fringes to the feathers. When flying, black-billed wood dove is told from this species by its bright chestnut underwings. The call is in three parts: two soft long coos, followed by a series of slow descending coos lasting 10 seconds, and concluding with 4 seconds of rapid coos, which decrease in volume. This species shows some geographical variation in plumage, but differences are clinal, and emerald- spotted wood dove is now considered to be monotypic. Behaviour The emerald-spotted wood dove builds a flimsy stick nest in a tree or shrub, and lays two cream-coloured eggs. Both sexes incubate for 13–17 days to hatching, and feed the squabs for 13–17 days to fledging. Many young birds are taken by mongooses and shrikes. The emerald-spotted wood dove is not gregarious, but flocks may form at waterholes. This species usually forages on the ground for grass and other small seeds.

The village was called as Jittwal during the rule of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. It is said to have been established by two brothers named Bhai Karam Chand & Bhai Sahib Chand. They were of very pious and saintly in nature. God gave them spiritual healing power. People started visiting them and paying respect. Once a caravan of Maharaja Ranjit Singh's relatives was passing when a lady fell ill. Since there was no Vaid/Hakim () available, the sick lady was brought to Bhai Karam Chand. Bhai Karam Chand offered a Pircle of Jittwal earth and the lady recovered with this miracle. People started honoring and worship with the passage of the next generations of these two godly brothers were looked after very nicely by the people. In the last-years of 21st century a beautiful Gurudwara Sahib has been constructed in their memory at place where their Samadh was existing. Because of this Gurudwara Sahib has been named as Gurudawara Dera Baba Simadhan, people now worship at here. The next generation of baba Bhai Karam Chand & Sahib Chand is called by the name, \\"Bhai Ke\\". A large population of this village consists of people belonging to the Maan clan of Jatts. The Maans are known as Bhai Ke. The other Jatt people of Sandhu and Sidhu clan can also be found in a substantial number with the Ghatoura clan of Ramgarhia caste and there are found caste like Ramdassia Sikh ; Mazbi Sikh etc. as well as Muslim community.

He served as abbot of Flavigny from 1097 to 1100. Life Hugh was born about 1064, probably at Verdun. According to his own testimony, his mother was Lady Dada of Montfaucon, daughter of Chlotildis, daughter of the Emperor Otto III. In any case, he belonged to a prominent family, and received his education at the monastery of St-Vannes at Verdun, where he afterwards took the habit of a Benedictine novice. As Dietrich, Bishop of Verdun was a supporter of the Holy Roman emperor Henry IV and antipope Clement III, the Abbot of St-Vannes, who supported the pope, was forced to leave his monastery. He went to the Abbey of St-Bénigne at Dijon, where he was followed by nearly all of his monks, including Hugh. While at Dijon, the latter made his vows before the Abbot Jarento, a strong adherent of the ecclesiastical party and an enthusiastic personal friend of Pope Gregory VII. Abbot Jarento soon gave Hugh his entire confidence; Hugh, the Archbishop of Lyons was also most friendly towards the young monk and often requisitioned his services. In 1096, notwithstanding his youth, Hugh was elected Abbot of Flavigny, but soon became involved in disputes, not only with the Bishop of Autun, in whose diocese he was, but also with his own monks, who wished to make use of all, even dishonest, means in the pope's behalf. On account of these differences, he was obliged on two occasions to flee, and finally to abdicate, although the Council of Valence (in 1100) ordered him to be reinstated. These bitter experiences gradually brought about a complete change in his politico-religious views on the question of investitures. From a zealous, self-sacrificing champion, he became a determined adversary of the papal claims, even going so far in his opposition as to accept from Bishop Richard of Verdun, a follower of the emperor, the dignity of Abbot of Verdun, after Abbot Laurentius, who supported the pope, had been quite illegally dispossessed. But he only succeeded in maintaining this position from 1111 to 1114, after which he seems to have lived in strict seclusion at Verdun as a simple monk.  Work  As early as his sojourn at Dijon, probably at the instance of Abbot Jarento and Archbishop Hugh, he had begun a Latin chronicle of the world's history from the birth of Christ down to his own times (Chronicon Virdunense seu Flaviniacense). This we possess in two books. The first, which extends to the year 1002, is little more than a loosely planned compilation, and its importance is entirely due to the fragments of older lost works which it contains. The second covers the years from 1002 to 1112 and is valuable especially for the history of Lorraine, and also for the ecclesiastical history of France. With wide erudition Hugh collected a great mass of materials, and where his facts became too unwieldy he abandoned the annalistic form for full and detailed narrative. In this manner he brings out in relief the \\"Acta Gregorii VII\\" (papal biography of Gregory VII); \\"Series Abbatum Flaviniacensium\\" (on his predecessors as abbot of Flavigny); \\"Vita beati Richardi, abbatis S. Vitori\\" and \\"Vita S. Magdalvei\\" (two hagiographies). His account of the papal election of Victor III is a masterpiece for his period. In general, however, he cannot be said to control his materials. Making no attempt at arrangement, he quotes original documents, his own experiences, or the testimony of others, to whose tales he often gives more credit than they deserve.

History Glenada was incorporated in 1912 and disincorporated in 1922, after the town's sawmills burned. Glenada was platted by George Huestis Colter (Coulter) in 1889. Colter purchased an unbroken mile of river frontage and combined the names of his wife, Jane Ada Grant, and youngest daughter, Ada Colter, to name the town of Glen-ada in their honor. The United States Postal Service condensed the name to Glenada. Colter owned a large amount of land in the area, including four hundred and fifty lots in Glenada, one hundred and in Fiddle Creek, and also one hundred and within one mile (1.6 km) of the city of Florence. In addition to these valuable holdings, he owned over of timber forests adjoining Glenada. The Glenada Hotel was built to accommodate travelers and also housed the Colter family, costing $4,000 to build. George Huestis Colter was born on June 12, 1854, in Nova Scotia to Daniel and Almira (Huestis) Colter, the former a native of County Sligo, Ireland, and the latter of Nova Scotia. George left Nova Scotia in 1869 and settled in San Francisco, California. Colter is buried in the Glenada Odd Fellows Cemetery, to which he donated the land and in which family plots were reserved. However, only one grandson, Dean Colter, who drowned, is buried next to him.Mittge, Kevin K.

(), also released as Island of the Damned, is a 1976 Spanish horror film directed by Narciso Ibáñez Serrador. The film follows an English couple who find an island inhabited by maniacal children.New York Times Plot A montage of documentary footage depicts the effect of war on children. The film cuts from this mondo imagery to the story of English couple Tom and Evelyn (Lewis Fiander and Prunella Ransome), who are taking a vacation before the birth of their third child. They arrive on an island where they encounter grim-faced, silent children who seem to be the island's entire population. Throughout their stay, they witness the children behaving strangely. They later learn that the children are capable of violence; they have murdered just about every adult on the island. The couple are now forced to consider killing the children in self-defense. It is implied that the long list of atrocities and horrors brought upon children by adults' fighting and apathy has caused the island's children to take matters into their own hands. It's also shown that normal children are changed like the rest on the island merely by making eye contact with them. Tom reluctantly shoots one boy with a gun when they are cornered in a room. Trapped in the room, Evelyn is killed when her unborn child joins the island children and attacks her from inside. By the next morning, a weary Tom is completely alone. Tom eventually shoots an MP-40 at a group of children as he tries to escape the island, but the children follow him to the dock and attack en masse as he tries to cut a boat loose. As he tries to fight off the children, a Spanish military/police patrol boat arrives. The crew thinks that Tom is killing the children in cold blood, and one officer draws his weapon on him, ordering him to stay still. When he doesn't, the officer shoots him dead. The patrol boat docks, and the officers begin tending to the injured children, with the officer who shot Tom wondering aloud, \\"what kind of man...?\\" When asked where their parents are, the children point towards the town, and the three officers depart, leaving their boat and their weapons unsecured. One officer is stopped by a child calling out \\"Goodbye!\\" He turns to see that the children have boarded the patrol boat and are unloading its small-arms inventory. One of the boys kills the three officers with a rifle. The movie ends with a small group of children preparing to head to mainland Spain on a motorboat, taking care to go in low numbers to avoid suspicion. When one girl asks, \\"Do you think the other children will start playing the way we do?\\" the boy in charge grins and says, \\"Oh, yes...there are lots of children in the world. Lots of them.\\" Production The film was based on a novel by Juan José Plans titled El juego de los niños (The children's game) and adapted for cinema by Narciso Ibáñez Serrador under his pseudonym Luis Peñafiel. Critical reception Modern response Modern critical response for the film has been mostly positive. Dennis Schwartz from Ozus' World Movie Reviews rated the film a grade B-, calling it \\"Unapologetic downbeat\\" but criticized the third act as failing to capitalize on its interesting premise. Maitland McDonagh from TV Guide the film three out of five stars, stating that \\"it may be the finest variation on an enduring horror theme: The violent rebellion by children against cruel or indifferent adults.\\" Felix Vasquez Jr. from Cinema Crazed called it \\"a harrowing disturbing look at the inherent evil children are capable of\\", and praised the film's unflinching narrative, disturbing sequences, and ending. Brett Gallman from Oh the Horror offered the film similar praise, as well as the film's \\"artful approach\\". Ian Jane from DVD Talk rated the film four out of five stars, writing, \\"An intelligent, albeit very grim, thriller, Who Can Kill A Child? holds up well as a great piece of tension-filled filmmaking.\\" Legacy Who Can Kill a Child? has gained a cult following over the years since its initial release, and is now considered a cult classic. It later appeared at number 86 in Slant Magazines list of \\"The 100 Best Horror Movies of All Time\\". Released in 2012, Come Out and Play is a Mexcian remake that closely mirrors the plot of the original.

SNDP was the first organization to envisage Kerala as a whole, and one of the most powerful castes in India. In 2020, Vavoottu Yogam expanded and formed an organization known as Aruvippuram Kshetra Yogam. The Aruvippuram Temple Society: known as Vavoottu Yogam emerged in 1888.

With the 1891 Malayali Memorial Revolt, he took the leadership of the community; and attempted to begin an organization called Ezhava Sabha. In 1896, he created the organizations' by-laws and published the law in Malayali, a newspaper published from Thankussery. He organized a few meetings at Paravur and Mayyanad, before the movement failed. On January 7, 1903, a special meeting of Aruvippuram Kshetra Yogam was conducted.

The gun was based on an artillery piece originally developed by the French arms manufacturer Schneider prior to World War I and used by the Russian Empire as the 107 mm gun M1910. The modernized variant, adopted in 1931, differed from the original design mainly by having a larger chamber and longer barrel, resulting in longer range. The M1910/30 remained in production until the mid-1930s and was employed by the Red Army in World War II, mainly in corps artillery and Reserve of the Main Command units. A number of captured guns were used by the Wehrmacht. Development and production From the late 1920s the RKKA sought to upgrade its First World War era artillery pieces. One of the modernized weapons was the 107 mm gun M1910, originally designed by the French arms manufacturer Schneider. Modernization projects were submitted by Orudiyno- Arsenalny Trest (OAT) and by the design bureau of the Scientific and Technical Committee of the Main Directorate of Artillery (KB NTK GAU). After trials it was decided to adopt the weapon designed by KB NTK GAU, but to fit it with an equilibrating mechanism as used in the OAT project. The modernized weapon was adopted in 1931 as the 107 mm gun M1910/30.Shirokorad - Encyclopedia of the Soviet Artillery. The upgrade included the following: *The barrel was lengthened by 10 calibers and fitted with a muzzle brake; *The chamber was lengthened; *Separate cartridge loading was introduced; *There were changes in the recuperator, cradle and elevation mechanism. The weapon was manufactured by the Bolshevik Plant in Leningrad and by the Barrikady Plant in Stalingrad from 1931 until 1935 or later. Additionally, a number of M1910 pieces were upgraded by Bolshevik, No 7, No 13 and KKZ plants. Description M1910/30, left side view The barrel of the M1910/30 was longer than the original barrel and was fitted with a slotted muzzle brake (which reduced recoil by 25%); in order to balance the barrel, a special weight was fitted to the opposite end of the tube. The breech was of the interrupted screw type. The recoil system, consisting of a hydraulic recoil buffer and a hydro-pneumatic recuperator, was located in a sleigh below the barrel. The box trail carriage was nearly identical to that of the M1910. It had either unsprung wooden wheels or metal wheels with solid rubber tires. With wooden wheels, the speed of transportation was limited to about 6 km/h. A team of eight horses was needed to tow the gun; another six towed an ammunition box with 42 rounds. Organization and service Red Army The M1910/30 guns were issued to corps artillery. In 1941, three variants of corps artillery regiments existed: *Two battalions of 152 mm howitzer-guns M1937 (ML-20) (24 pieces) and one battalion of 107 mm guns (12 pieces). *Two battalions of ML-20 (24 pieces) and two battalions of 122 mm guns or 107 mm guns (24 pieces). *Three battalions of ML-20 (36 pieces). In September 1941 rifle corps of the RKKA were disbanded, therefore corps level artillery ceased to exist. 107 mm guns were then issued to Reserve of the Main Command units, in 12, 18 or 24-piece gun regiments or 36-piece gun brigades. When corps level was reintroduced in 1943, most 107 mm pieces were again given to corps artillery. New corps artillery regiments had 16-20 pieces and along with 107 mm guns included 122 mm guns and 152 mm howitzers.Military History Journal, no 5, 2005. Many 107 mm guns were also used by the independent artillery regiments of fortified regions and by independent battalions and batteries belonging to fronts and armies. The M1910/30 were used by the Red Army in the Battle of Khalkhin Gol, where four pieces were lost.Kolomiets - The Battle of River Khalkhin-Gol. They also saw action in the Winter War (12 pieces in the 7th Army, 24 in the 467th Artillery Regiment of the 8th Army, 12 in the 51st Artillery Regiment of the 9th Army), apparently without losses.Shirokorad - Northern Wars of Russia. In June 1941, according to different sources, the Red Army possessed 828 (including four belonging to the navy)Red Army on 22 June 1941, Statistics, no 1. or 863 pieces of this type. 474 107 mm guns, including a limited numbers of the new M-60, belonged to western military districts.tank.uw.ru. Many were lost at the beginning of the Great Patriotic War. In 1943, the RKKA had at least 490 107 mm guns of all models, the majority of them M1910/30; some remained in service until the end of the war. A surviving piece can be seen in the Artillery Museum in Saint Petersburg. Wehrmacht A number of M1910/30 guns were captured by the Wehrmacht and pressed into service in both field and coastal artillery. In German service, the gun was designated the 10,7 cm K 352(r). In March 1944, the Wehrmacht still possessed 17 pieces, all on the Eastern Front.Shirokorad - The God of War of The Third Reich. Summary The modernization of the M1910/30 gave the Red Army a relatively lightweight, reliable corps artillery piece with improved range and a wide array of ammunition. On the other side, it failed to address other drawbacks of the weapon. Because of its unsprung wheels, the M1910/30 was unsuitable for high- speed transportation. A very small traverse of 6 degrees limited the effectiveness of the gun against enemy tanks, despite decent armor penetration. For the sake of comparison, the standard German 105 mm gun, the 10.5 cm sK 18, surpassed the M1910/30 in range (19 km, or 21 km for a modernized K 18/40), traverse (60 degrees) and transportation speed (up to 40 km/h). This, however, came at a price of a much larger weight of about six tons. In 1940, the RKKA adopted a more modern 107 mm gun, the M-60. Although originally intended - and officially designated - as a divisional gun, in practice the M-60 was never used by rifle divisions; from 1943 it mainly served in the reintroduced corps artillery. However, soon after the outbreak of war, production of the M-60 was stopped. In 1943 another 107 mm gun, the 9S-1, was developed, but it was never adopted, leaving the M1910/30 the last mass production 107 mm piece in Red Army service. Ammunition The gun fired separately loaded, cased charge ammunition. Two different charges – full and reduced – were used. Use of the full charge was prohibited with the muzzle brake removed, or with old high-explosive ammunition, shrapnel and smoke rounds. The explosion of the OF-420 shell, with the fuse set to the fragmentation action, resulted in damage to 90% of targets in the 6 to 14 meters area and to 50% of targets in a 20 to 42 meter area. When the fuse was set to high-explosive action, the shell made a crater 1–1.5 m in diameter and 40–60 cm deep in an average soil. The shrapnel shell contained more than 600 bullets and covered an area about 800 m long and 45–50 m wide. { border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2 style=\\"margin:0 0 .5em 1em; width:95%; background:#fff;

The character of Lord Pimpole is first mentioned in Porterhouse Blue (1974), set in the fictitious Porterhouse College in Cambridge, where his name, with that of a former student, Launcelot Gutterby, is often chanted to himself by Skullion, the Head Porter, as the mantra \\"Gutterby and Pimpole\\", when it seems that standards at the College are slipping. This helps to remind Skullion of the days when students had been proper gentlemen. In the sequel, Grantchester Grind (1995), the character of Pimpole plays a more central role. In this novel he has changed from the 'delightfully vague and charming young man' of his student days to an unwashed and abusive alcoholic with a sexual predilection for sheep and dogs. Because of his spending, mostly on alcohol, he has lost Pimpole Hall, the ancestral home, and is reduced to living in a gamekeeper's lodge on what had been his family's estate. His favourite drink is Dog's Nose, usually made up of seven ounces of gin to thirteen ounces of beer. Pimpole's version of the drink is made up of 60% gin. At the end of Grantchester Grind Skullion, who became Master of Porterhouse College on the death of Sir Godber Evans, nominates Lord Pimpole as the next Master of the College.

A switch hitter, Gaspar played for the New York Mets (1969–70) and San Diego Padres (1971, 1974). A former player at Long Beach State and Long Beach City College, Gaspar played 178 games in his career, 118 of them in his rookie year, . He began the year as the Mets’ starting right fielder, then became a utility outfielder (he also played left and center field on occasion) after Ron Swoboda became the regular right fielder. That year, he hit .228, recorded in 14 of his 17 career runs batted in, and hit his only Major League home run, off Mike McCormick of the San Francisco Giants on May 30. He also excelled defensively, leading all Mets outfielders in assists with 12, and leading the National League in double plays with six. That year, Gaspar was a member of the Miracle Mets team that unexpectedly won the World Series in five games over the Baltimore Orioles. Before the Series, Orioles' outfielder, Frank Robinson said, \\"Bring on the Mets and Ron Gaspar!\\" He was then told by his teammate, Merv Rettenmund, \\"It's Rod, stupid.\\" He then retorted by saying, \\"OK. Bring on Rod Stupid!\\"http://ultimatemets.com/profile.php?PlayerCode=0172&tabno;=7 In Game Four of that Series, Gaspar scored the winning run on a controversial play at Shea Stadium. With the score tied at 1-1 in the bottom of the tenth, Gaspar pinch-ran for Jerry Grote, who had led off the inning with a double. An intentional walk to Al Weis followed, after which J. C. Martin, pinch-hitting for Tom Seaver, bunted to the pitcher. Both runners advanced, and as Martin ran to first, Pete Richert's throw hit him on the hand and ricocheted away, the error allowing Gaspar to score the winning run. (Replays would later show that Martin had been running inside the baseline, which could have resulted in him being called out for interference; however, the umpires said they didn't make the call because they felt Martin didn't intentionally interfere with the play.) Gaspar's son Cade also achieved some measure of distinction as a baseball player. Cade Gaspar played college ball at Saddleback College for two years before becoming a West Coast Conference All-Star with Pepperdine University in 1994, and the Detroit Tigers selected him with the eighteenth overall pick in the first round of the 1994 Major League Baseball Draft. The younger Gaspar played minor league baseball for three years, in the farm systems of the Tigers and the San Diego Padres.

For centuries, Porterhouse College has been renowned for its cuisine, the prowess of its rowers and the low level of its academic achievements. Since the College was founded there have been Skullions at Porterhouse. Skullion is the Head Porter at the College, a responsibility he has held for many years and which he takes very seriously indeed. Head Porter of Porterhouse College Cover of 'Porterhouse Blue' James Skullion's first contact with Porterhouse College came when, as a young boy, he carried the students' cases for sixpence when they arrived at the railway station at Cambridge, running beside their cabs to help unload them at the College. He became a Porter at Porterhouse in 1937 and served in the Royal Marines during the Second World War. He became the Head Porter in 1949. In the books, Skullion has worked at the College for forty-five years, has served seven Masters, and sees himself as a link with the College's great and glorious past; as such he regards it as his duty to maintain the standards of bygone years. Porterhouse is not an academic college; rather, it is a club for gentlemen, where admission depends on rank and wealth and where degrees can be bought. This often involves a brighter substitute from another college being paid to take the place of the Porterhouse student in the examination. Based on their fraudulent degrees, many of these students have gone on to obtain positions of great power in government and industry. These men are known as 'Skullion's Scholars' . He keeps their names on a list, knowing it will be useful one day. When the Master of Porterhouse dies without naming his successor, the College Visitor, the Queen, takes the Prime Minister's advice and appoints Sir Godber Evans (a former student at the College) as his successor. Sir Godber, having been pressured by his wealthy left-wing wife, Lady Mary, announces sweeping changes to the centuries of College tradition, much to the concern of Skullion and the Fellows, who plan a counter attack to the proposed contraceptive machines, women students, and a self-service canteen. He also intends to sell the row of houses where the College servants live. Skullion contemptuously remembers Sir Godber from his student days as not being a gentleman as he had been educated at a grammar school. Skullion is sacked for insolence by Sir Godber, the new Master, and is forced to leave his home. He appears live on a television programme in which he reveals all of the College's murky secrets, and refers to his list of 'Skullion's Scholars' , to the horror of Sir Godber and the College's Senior Fellows, but to the amusement of everybody else. Skullion returns to Cambridge, determined to ask for his job back in return for donating a large inheritance he has received to the College. He confronts Sir Godber who treats him with pity and contempt. This angers Skullion's sense of pride, and he advances menacingly on Sir Godber, who, backing away in fear, trips and bangs his head. He is found dying by the Dean and Senior Tutor and tries to tell them who is responsible. They misunderstand his meaning and believe that he has named Skullion as his successor as Master. They inform Skullion of this and he suffers a 'Porterhouse Blue' , a stroke, but survives and is installed as Master of the College. Master of Porterhouse Cover of Grantchester Grind In Grantchester Grind the wheel-chair bound Skullion is still Master, but is showing signs of physical frailty. The mystery surrounding the death of the previous Master, Sir Godber Evans, prompts his widow, the millionairess Lady Mary, to instigate a plan to investigate the death through a planted Fellow, Dr Purefoy Osbert, backed by a large, anonymous donation to Porterhouse. At the same time, the Dean decides to look for a new Master for the College, preferably a wealthy one, to replace Skullion; he drives around the country visiting Old Porterthusians (previous students at Porterhouse), including Lord Jeremy Pimpole, (who is now a chronic alcoholic with a sexual predilection for sheep and dogs), in the hope that he will find one is willing to become Master. None is suitable. Meanwhile, the College Bursar is contacted by the American media and drug-running billionaire Edgar Hartang, who seems to be interested in supporting the College without clarifying what it is he wants in return. Knowing that Dr Osbert is eavesdropping, Skullion admits that he murdered Sir Godber Evans. He is immediately and secretly sent to Porterhouse Park, an unpleasant retirement home for the College's mad or troublesome Fellows. He escapes from here with the assistance of Dr Osbert, and returns to Porterhouse and confronts the Fellows. As is his right as Master, Skullion nominates the new Master of the College, the alcoholic Lord Pimpole. Skullion in film In 1987 Porterhouse Blue was adapted for television as Porterhouse Blue by Malcolm Bradbury for Channel 4, with David Jason playing the role of Skullion,Porterhouse Blue on the Internet Movie Database and winning a BAFTA for Best Actor for the role.

A claw is another name for the complete bipartite graph K1,3 (that is, a star graph with three edges, three leaves, and one central vertex). A claw-free graph is a graph in which no induced subgraph is a claw; i.e., any subset of four vertices has other than only three edges connecting them in this pattern. Equivalently, a claw- free graph is a graph in which the neighborhood of any vertex is the complement of a triangle-free graph. Claw-free graphs were initially studied as a generalization of line graphs, and gained additional motivation through three key discoveries about them: the fact that all claw-free connected graphs of even order have perfect matchings, the discovery of polynomial time algorithms for finding maximum independent sets in claw-free graphs, and the characterization of claw-free perfect graphs., p. 88. They are the subject of hundreds of mathematical research papers and several surveys. Examples The regular icosahedron, a polyhedron whose vertices and edges form a claw-free graph. * The line graph L(G) of any graph G is claw-free; L(G) has a vertex for every edge of G, and vertices are adjacent in L(G) whenever the corresponding edges share an endpoint in G. A line graph L(G) cannot contain a claw, because if three edges e1, e2, and e3 in G all share endpoints with another edge e4 then by the pigeonhole principle at least two of e1, e2, and e3 must share one of those endpoints with each other. Line graphs may be characterized in terms of nine forbidden subgraphs;. the claw is the simplest of these nine graphs. This characterization provided the initial motivation for studying claw-free graphs. *The de Bruijn graphs (graphs whose vertices represent n-bit binary strings for some n, and whose edges represent (n − 1)-bit overlaps between two strings) are claw-free. One way to show this is via the construction of the de Bruijn graph for n-bit strings as the line graph of the de Bruijn graph for (n − 1)-bit strings. *The complement of any triangle-free graph is claw-free., p. 89. These graphs include as a special case any complete graph. *Proper interval graphs, the interval graphs formed as intersection graphs of families of intervals in which no interval contains another interval, are claw-free, because four properly intersecting intervals cannot intersect in the pattern of a claw. The same is true more generally for proper circular-arc graphs.. *The Moser spindle, a seven-vertex graph used to provide a lower bound for the chromatic number of the plane, is claw-free. *The graphs of several polyhedra and polytopes are claw-free, including the graph of the tetrahedron and more generally of any simplex (a complete graph), the graph of the octahedron and more generally of any cross polytope (isomorphic to the cocktail party graph formed by removing a perfect matching from a complete graph), the graph of the regular icosahedron,. and the graph of the 16-cell. *The Schläfli graph, a strongly regular graph with 27 vertices, is claw-free. Recognition It is straightforward to verify that a given graph with n vertices and m edges is claw-free in time O(n4), by testing each 4-tuple of vertices to determine whether they induce a claw., p. 132. With more efficiency, and greater complication, one can test whether a graph is claw-free by checking, for each vertex of the graph, that the complement graph of its neighbors does not contain a triangle. A graph contains a triangle if and only if the cube of its adjacency matrix contains a nonzero diagonal element, so finding a triangle may be performed in the same asymptotic time bound as n × n matrix multiplication.. Therefore, using the Coppersmith–Winograd algorithm, the total time for this claw-free recognition algorithm would be O(n3.376). observe that in any claw-free graph, each vertex has at most 2 neighbors; for otherwise by Turán's theorem the neighbors of the vertex would not have enough remaining edges to form the complement of a triangle-free graph. This observation allows the check of each neighborhood in the fast matrix multiplication based algorithm outlined above to be performed in the same asymptotic time bound as 2 × 2 matrix multiplication, or faster for vertices with even lower degrees. The worst case for this algorithm occurs when Ω() vertices have Ω() neighbors each, and the remaining vertices have few neighbors, so its total time is O(m3.376/2) = O(m1.688). Enumeration Because claw-free graphs include complements of triangle-free graphs, the number of claw-free graphs on n vertices grows at least as quickly as the number of triangle-free graphs, exponentially in the square of n. The numbers of connected claw-free graphs on n nodes, for n = 1, 2, ... are :1, 1, 2, 5, 14, 50, 191, 881, 4494, 26389, 184749, ... . If the graphs are allowed to be disconnected, the numbers of graphs are even larger: they are :1, 2, 4, 10, 26, 85, 302, 1285, 6170, ... . A technique of allows the number of claw-free cubic graphs to be counted very efficiently, unusually for graph enumeration problems. Matchings Sumner's proof that claw-free connected graphs of even order have perfect matchings: removing the two adjacent vertices v and w that are farthest from u leaves a connected subgraph, within which the same removal process may be repeated. and, independently, proved that every claw-free connected graph with an even number of vertices has a perfect matching., pp. 120–124. That is, there exists a set of edges in the graph such that each vertex is an endpoint of exactly one of the matched edges. The special case of this result for line graphs implies that, in any graph with an even number of edges, one can partition the edges into paths of length two. Perfect matchings may be used to provide another characterization of the claw-free graphs: they are exactly the graphs in which every connected induced subgraph of even order has a perfect matching. Sumner's proof shows, more strongly, that in any connected claw-free graph one can find a pair of adjacent vertices the removal of which leaves the remaining graph connected. To show this, Sumner finds a pair of vertices u and v that are as far apart as possible in the graph, and chooses w to be a neighbor of v that is as far from u as possible; as he shows, neither v nor w can lie on any shortest path from any other node to u, so the removal of v and w leaves the remaining graph connected. Repeatedly removing matched pairs of vertices in this way forms a perfect matching in the given claw-free graph. The same proof idea holds more generally if u is any vertex, v is any vertex that is maximally far from u, and w is any neighbor of v that is maximally far from u. Further, the removal of v and w from the graph does not change any of the other distances from u. Therefore, the process of forming a matching by finding and removing pairs vw that are maximally far from u may be performed by a single postorder traversal of a breadth first search tree of the graph, rooted at u, in linear time. provide an alternative linear-time algorithm based on depth-first search, as well as efficient parallel algorithms for the same problem. list several related results, including the following: (r − 1)-connected K1,r-free graphs of even order have perfect matchings for any r ≥ 2; claw-free graphs of odd order with at most one degree-one vertex may be partitioned into an odd cycle and a matching; for any k that is at most half the minimum degree of a claw-free graph in which either k or the number of vertices is even, the graph has a k-factor; and, if a claw-free graph is (2k + 1)-connected, then any k-edge matching can be extended to a perfect matching. Independent sets A non-maximum independent set (the two violet nodes) and an augmenting path An independent set in a line graph corresponds to a matching in its underlying graph, a set of edges no two of which share an endpoint. The blossom algorithm of finds a maximum matching in any graph in polynomial time, which is equivalent to computing a maximum independent set in line graphs. This has been independently extended to an algorithm for all claw-free graphs by and ., pp. 133–134. Both approaches use the observation that in claw-free graphs, no vertex can have more than two neighbors in an independent set, and so the symmetric difference of two independent sets must induce a subgraph of degree at most two; that is, it is a union of paths and cycles. In particular, if I is a non-maximum independent set, it differs from any maximum independent set by even cycles and so called augmenting paths: induced paths which alternate between vertices not in I and vertices in I, and for which both endpoints have only one neighbor in I. As the symmetric difference of I with any augmenting path gives a larger independent set, the task thus reduces to searching for augmenting paths until no more can be found, analogously as in algorithms for finding maximum matchings. Sbihi's algorithm recreates the blossom contraction step of Edmonds' algorithm and adds a similar, but more complicated, clique contraction step. Minty's approach is to transform the problem instance into an auxiliary line graph and use Edmonds' algorithm directly to find the augmenting paths. After a correction by , Minty's result may also be used to solve in polynomial time the more general problem of finding in claw-free graphs an independent set of maximum weight. Generalizations of these results to wider classes of graphs are also known. By showing a novel structure theorem, gave a cubic time algorithm, which also works in the weighted setting. Coloring, cliques, and domination A perfect graph is a graph in which the chromatic number and the size of the maximum clique are equal, and in which this equality persists in every induced subgraph. It is now known (the strong perfect graph theorem) that perfect graphs may be characterized as the graphs that do not have as induced subgraphs either an odd cycle or the complement of an odd cycle (a so-called odd hole).. However, for many years this remained an unsolved conjecture, only proven for special subclasses of graphs. One of these subclasses was the family of claw-free graphs: it was discovered by several authors that claw-free graphs without odd cycles and odd holes are perfect. Perfect claw-free graphs may be recognized in polynomial time. In a perfect claw-free graph, the neighborhood of any vertex forms the complement of a bipartite graph. It is possible to color perfect claw-free graphs, or to find maximum cliques in them, in polynomial time., pp. 135–136. In general, it is NP-hard to find the largest clique in a claw-free graph. It is also NP-hard to find an optimal coloring of the graph, because (via line graphs) this problem generalizes the NP-hard problem of computing the chromatic index of a graph. For the same reason, it is NP-hard to find a coloring that achieves an approximation ratio better than 4/3. However, an approximation ratio of two can be achieved by a greedy coloring algorithm, because the chromatic number of a claw-free graph is greater than half its maximum degree. A generalization of the edge list coloring conjecture states that, for claw-free graphs, the list chromatic number equals the chromatic number; these two numbers can be far apart in other kinds of graphs. The claw- free graphs are χ-bounded, meaning that every claw-free graph of large chromatic number contains a large clique. More strongly, it follows from Ramsey's theorem that every claw-free graph of large maximum degree contains a large clique, of size roughly proportional to the square root of the degree. For connected claw-free graphs that include at least one three-vertex independent set, a stronger relation between chromatic number and clique size is possible: in these graphs, there exists a clique of size at least half the chromatic number. Although not every claw-free graph is perfect, claw-free graphs satisfy another property, related to perfection. A graph is called domination perfect if it has a minimum dominating set that is independent, and if the same property holds in all of its induced subgraphs. Claw-free graphs have this property. To see this, let D be a dominating set in a claw-free graph, and suppose that v and w are two adjacent vertices in D; then the set of vertices dominated by v but not by w must be a clique (else v would be the center of a claw). If every vertex in this clique is already dominated by at least one other member of D, then v can be removed producing a smaller independent dominating set, and otherwise v can be replaced by one of the undominated vertices in its clique producing a dominating set with fewer adjacencies. By repeating this replacement process one eventually reaches a dominating set no larger than D, so in particular when the starting set D is a minimum dominating set this process forms an equally small independent dominating set., pp. 124–125. Despite this domination perfectness property, it is NP-hard to determine the size of the minimum dominating set in a claw-free graph. However, in contrast to the situation for more general classes of graphs, finding the minimum dominating set or the minimum connected dominating set in a claw-free graph is fixed-parameter tractable: it can be solved in time bounded by a polynomial in the size of the graph multiplied by an exponential function of the dominating set size.; . Structure overview a series of papers in which they prove a structure theory for claw-free graphs, analogous to the graph structure theorem for minor-closed graph families proven by Robertson and Seymour, and to the structure theory for perfect graphs that Chudnovsky, Seymour and their co-authors used to prove the strong perfect graph theorem. The theory is too complex to describe in detail here, but to give a flavor of it, it suffices to outline two of their results. First, for a special subclass of claw-free graphs which they call quasi-line graphs (equivalently, locally co-bipartite graphs), they state that every such graph has one of two forms: # A fuzzy circular interval graph, a class of graphs represented geometrically by points and arcs on a circle, generalizing proper circular arc graphs. # A graph constructed from a multigraph by replacing each edge by a fuzzy linear interval graph. This generalizes the construction of a line graph, in which every edge of the multigraph is replaced by a vertex. Fuzzy linear interval graphs are constructed in the same way as fuzzy circular interval graphs, but on a line rather than on a circle. Chudnovsky and Seymour classify arbitrary connected claw-free graphs into one of the following: # Six specific subclasses of claw-free graphs. Three of these are line graphs, proper circular arc graphs, and the induced subgraphs of an icosahedron; the other three involve additional definitions. # Graphs formed in four simple ways from smaller claw-free graphs. # Antiprismatic graphs, a class of dense graphs defined as the claw-free graphs in which every four vertices induce a subgraph with at least two edges. Much of the work in their structure theory involves a further analysis of antiprismatic graphs. The Schläfli graph, a claw-free strongly regular graph with parameters srg(27,16,10,8), plays an important role in this part of the analysis. This structure theory has led to new advances in polyhedral combinatorics and new bounds on the chromatic number of claw-free graphs, as well as to new fixed- parameter-tractable algorithms for dominating sets in claw-free graphs.

Quan họ is common in rituals and festivals, and a common theme in many songs is love and sentimentality as experienced by young adults. Quan họ was recognised as a UNESCO Intanginble Cultural Heritage practice in 2009.UNESCO Culture Sector - Intangible Heritage - 2003 Convention : The quan họ style originated in what is now Bắc Ninh Province and was first recorded in the 13th century, and has traditionally been associated with the spring festivals that follow the celebration of Tết (the Vietnamese New Year). Historically, the singing began on the evening before the festival, but today it is much more common for the singing to occur on the main day of the festival. In general, an initial \\"challenge phrase\\" (câu ra) from the known body of songs is sung by a pair of female singers, following which a pair of male singers will respond by selecting and singing a \\"matching phrase\\" (câu đối), which must repeat the melody of the challenge phrase. Once they are finished, the order is reversed, and the men will issue their own challenge phrase with a different melody. While in the past the singing was unaccompanied, it is common today for the singers to be accompanied by instruments, whether traditional Vietnamese instruments or modern ones such as electric keyboards. There are a large number of quan họ melodies, with thousands of different songs having been recorded and written down in score form. A simpler variant of response song, allowing spoken responses and sung by boys and girls at village festivals is trống quân singing.

At the time of the 2001 census, area Wrexham 014A, which includes Rhostyllen itself, had a population of 1,383 in 599 households.Wrexham 014A Key Figures, Office for National Statistics Its name may be derived from the Welsh words rhos (\\"moor\\", or \\"rush pasture\\") and estyll (\\"staves\\" or \\"planks\\"). Rhostyllen was a part of the old township of Esclusham Below (i.e. \\"below\\" Offa's Dyke) and in 1879 was incorporated into the new ecclesiastical parish of Esclusham. The parish church, Holy Trinity, was completed in 1877.Esclusham, Holy Trinity , Clwyd FHS The corresponding civil parish of Esclusham became the community of Esclusham in 1974. Rhostyllen is a former mining village, with Bersham (or Glanyrafon) Colliery, which before closure in December 1986 was the last working coal mine in the Denbighshire coalfield, situated to the east of Wrexham Road. Like other villages in the area, many of its buildings are nineteenth-century miners' houses built in the distinctive local \\"Ruabon Red\\" brick.Landscape Character Area 7c, Wrexham County Borough Council This character is under threat as the village becomes increasingly linked to the outskirts of Wrexham by infill and commercial development along the A483 road. The focal point of the village is the village hall, built in 1924, and its recreation grounds.Davies, Jenkins and Baines, The Welsh Academy encyclopaedia of Wales, University of Wales Press, 2008, p.267 Rhostyllen's railway station was closed to passengers as long ago as 1931; the village was also formerly served by the line of the Wrexham and District Electric Tramways Company, opened in 1903, which ran from Penybryn in Wrexham to Johnstown and Rhosllannerchrugog: the halfway passing loop was situated at the Black Lion in Rhostyllen. Rhostyllen is served by the A483 trunk road. The eighteenth-century house and parkland at Erddig, now owned by the National Trust, is nearby.

As of 2014 two of the creations are extant. The Butler Baronetcy, of Cloughgrenan in the County of Carlow, was created in the Baronetage of Ireland on 16 August 1628 for Thomas Butler. He notably represented County Carlow in the Irish House of Commons and served as Sheriff of County Carlow. Butler was the illegitimate son of the Hon. Sir Edmund Butler of Cloughgrenan, second son of James Butler, 9th Earl of Ormonde (see the Earl of Ormond). His grandson, the third Baronet, also sat as Member of the Irish Parliament and served as Sheriff of the county. His eldest son, the fourth Baronet, represented County Carlow in the Irish Parliament and was admitted to the Irish Privy Council. He was succeeded by his nephew, the fifth Baronet. He represented County Carlow in the Irish House of Commons for many years. His son, the sixth Baronet, sat as Member of the Irish Parliament for County Carlow and Portarlington. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the seventh Baronet. He represented County Carlow in the Irish Parliament and also briefly (see County Carlow (UK Parliament constituency)) in the British House of Commons from 1801 to 1802. His great- grandson, the tenth Baronet, was High Sheriff and Vice Lord-Lieutenant for County Carlow. His son, the eleventh Baronet, served as High Sheriff of County Carlow in 1905 and was also a Deputy Lieutenant of the county. His son, the twelfth Baronet, was a Colonel in the Grenadier Guards. As of 2014 the title is held by the latter's son, the thirteenth Baronet, who succeeded in 1994. The family seat was Ballin Temple, near Tullow, County Cork. The Butler Baronetcy, of Polestown in the County of Kilkenny, was created in the Baronetage of Ireland on 8 July 1645 for Walter Butler. He was a descendant of Edmund Butler, younger son of James Butler, 3rd Earl of Ormonde. The title became either dormant or extinct on the death of the fourth Baronet in 1762. The Butler Baronetcy, of Old Park in Devizes in the County of Wiltshire, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 28 January 1922 for the businessman Reginald Butler. As of 2014 the title is held by his great- grandson, Sir Richard Butler, the fourth Baronet, who succeeded his father in 2012. He is a member of the Executive Committee of the Standing Council of the Baronetage. The Butler Baronetcy, of Edgbaston in the County of Warwick, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 29 January 1926 for the brewer William Butler, Chairman of Mitchells & Butlers Ltd. His only son William Owen Butler (1898–1935) predeceased him, without male issue. Consequently, the baronetcy became extinct on Butler's death in 1939.

Physics Quantum physics In quantum physics, the mathematical notion is usually applied to representations of the gauge group. E.g. an SU(2) gauge theory will have \\"multiplets\\" which are fields whose representation of SU(2) is determined by the single half integer number s, the (iso)\\"spin\\" since irreducible SU(2) representations are isomorphic to the 2sth symmetric power of the fundamental representation, every field has 2s symmetrised \\"internal indices\\". Fields are also transforming under representations of the Lorentz group (e.g. in the vector representation) or its spin group SL(2, 'C') (e.g. as Weyl spinors), which give the fields \\"Lorentz or (confusingly) \\"spin indices\\", In quantum field theory different particles correspond one to one with gauged fields transforming in irreducible representations of the internal and Lorentz group. Thus, a multiplet has also come to describe a collection of subatomic particles described by these representations. Multiplet may also describe a group of related spectral lines. Examples The best known example is a spin multiplet, which describes symmetries of a group representation of an SU(2) subgroup of the Lorentz algebra, which is used to define spin quantization. A spin singlet is a trivial representation, a spin doublet is a fundamental representation and a spin triplet is a vector representation. In QCD, quarks are in a multiplet of SU(3).

Materials  Running shorts are designed to facilitate comfort and free movement during exercise. Their materials are lightweight and hard- wearing. Many running shorts include an inner lining that acts as underwear, so wearing separate underwear is not necessary. Polyester is a common fabric in running shorts and makes it comfortable.  Variants  A man and woman in running shorts Many running shorts have a seam cut up the side of each leg to enable freer movement. Manufacturers define running shorts according to the length of the leg which is not cut. For example, a 3/4 seam means that 1/4 of the length is cut. * 1/2 split seam shorts are the shortest. * 3/4 split seam shorts are short, but not as short as 1/2 split seam shorts. * Square leg shorts have no split at all. Longer shorts are not ideal for running. A runner's stride may pull up the shorts' fabric, which can cause discomfort. Nonetheless, some runners prefer longer shorts because they cover a greater portion of their legs. Some runners use athletic hot pants as running shorts. Like 1/2 split seam shorts, hot pants do not encumber leg movement. Lycra running shorts are an alternative to conventional, polyester-based shorts. In most cases, they reach the mid-thigh. They are skin-tight, so they allow for more flexible, unencumbered movement.

He is the second-born son of three-time African Footballer of the Year and FIFA 100 member Abedi \\"Pele\\" Ayew and has two brothers, Ibrahim and Jordan, who also are professional footballers. In 2011 Ayew was named the BBC African Footballer of the Year and Ghanaian Footballer of the Year. Ayew began his career in Ghana, playing for Nania, while debuting for the club at age 14. In 2005, he signed with his father's former club, Marseille, and spent two seasons in the club's youth academy before making his debut in the 2007–08 season. Ayew spent the following two seasons on loan with Lorient and Arles- Avignon, helping the latter team earn promotion to Ligue 1 for the first time. In 2010, he returned to Marseille and became an integral part of the first team under manager Didier Deschamps, making over 200 appearances and winning consecutive Trophée des champions and Coupe de la Ligues in both 2010 and 2011. Ayew has been a full international for Ghana since 2008 and has earned over 80 caps. At youth level, he starred for and captained the under-20 team that won both the 2009 African Youth Championship and the 2009 FIFA U-20 World Cup. He has played in two FIFA World Cups (2010 and 2014), as well as six Africa Cup of Nations (2008, 2010, 2012, 2015, 2017 and 2019), helping them finish runner-up in 2010 and 2015, and was top goalscorer at the latter tournament.  Club career   Early career  Ayew began his career with 1860 München, where his father played. At the age of ten, Ayew was playing for Nania, where his father is club chairman, in Accra, Ghana. After four years of plying his trade in the club's youth academy, he was promoted to the team's senior squad at the age of 14. Despite being on the senior team, he still participated in youth-sanctioned events, such as the 2004 edition of the Altstetten U-19 Tournament, in which he was named one of the tournament's most famous players. Ayew played professional football at Nania for two seasons before departing the club and returning to France to play for his father's former club Marseille. Ayew joined the club on an aspirant (\\"trainee\\") contract and, upon his arrival, was put into the club's youth system and placed onto Marseille's first professional contract, agreeing to a three-year deal. He was officially promoted to the senior team and assigned the squad number 29 shirt.  Marseille  2010–2011 UEFA Champions League Ayew made his professional debut for Marseille on 15 August 2007 in a league match against Valenciennes, coming on as a substitute for Modeste M'bami in the 89th minute. Marseille lost the match 2–1. On 6 November, he made his UEFA Champions League debut against Portuguese champions Porto at the Estádio do Dragão, playing on the left wing in place of Bolo Zenden. Ayew played 77 minutes before being substituted out as Marseille were defeated 2–1. Ayew earned praise from the media for his performance of containing Porto right back José Bosingwa. Five days later, Ayew earned his first league start against Lyon at the Stade de Gerland. Ayew again featured in the team as Marseille pulled off a 2–1 victory. Ayew finished the season with 13 total appearances, nine in league play and two in cup play, in addition to two Champions League appearances. Ayew's first season with the club drew the attention of Premier League club Arsenal, who reportedly offered Marseille €6 million for the player. Marseille, however, denied the offer.  Loan moves  Ayew playing with Arles-Avignon in 2009 For the 2008–09 season, Ayew switched to the squad number 8 shirt, though due to the arrival of attackers Hatem Ben Arfa, Sylvain Wiltord, Bakari Koné and Mamadou Samassa, he was deemed surplus to requirements for the season and was loaned out to fellow first division club Lorient for the season. Ayew was used by manager Christian Gourcuff as one of the team's focal points of the attack alongside Fabrice Abriel, Kevin Gameiro and Rafik Saïfi and made his debut on 16 August 2008, coming on as a substitute in a 0–0 draw against Lyon. On 27 September 2008, he scored his first professional goal after netting the opener in the team's 1–1 draw with Sochaux. A month later, he scored his second career goal in a 4–1 rout of Saint-Étienne. Despite the initial success, Ayew was limited throughout the league campaign to just appearing as a substitute. He finished the season with 22 league appearances and three goals and, on 30 June 2009, returned to Marseille. Two months later, on 31 August 2009, the last day of the transfer window, new manager Didier Deschamps confirmed that Ayew would be joining newly promoted Ligue 2 club Arles-Avignon on loan for the 2009–10 season. Ayew was given the number 10 shirt and his favorable right wing position. He made his debut with the club on 11 September, appearing as a substitute in a 1–1 draw with Angers. The following week, he scored his first goal for the club in a 4–2 defeat to Tours. He was ever present in the team's fall campaign, but due to the 2010 Africa Cup of Nations, he missed the month of January. Ayew returned to the team on 5 February 2010 and appeared as a starter in all of the team's matches for the rest of the campaign. On 9 April, with the team in the midst of a promotion battle, Ayew scored a double in the team's 2–1 victory over Le Havre. The following week, he struck again scoring the opener in the team's 1–1 draw with Guingamp. On 14 May, Arles-Avignon secured promotion to Ligue 1 following the team's 1–0 win over Clermont.

International career  André Ayew as captain of Ghana versus Mali in 2015  Youth  Due to having dual French and Ghanaian citizenship, Ayew was eligible for France and Ghana. He initially chose to represent France, citing the failed inquiries of the Ghana Football Association to contact him as his reason why, but declared Ghana to be his first option, citing his father. Ayew was subsequently called up and participated in a training camp with the France under-18 team. In 2007, he turned down several offers to play for the country's under-21 team. Ayew later warned the Ghana Football Association that he was on the verge of representing France at international level, stating, \\"At this moment there is only one choice to make because I have only received an invitation from one country and that is France.\\" At the youth level, Ayew represented Ghana at under-20 level and captained the team to victory at both the 2009 African Youth Championship and the 2009 FIFA U-20 World Cup. At the African Youth Championship, Ayew scored two goals against Cameroon in the group stage and South Africa in the semi-finals. The 4–3 semi-final result progressed Ghana to the final where the team defeated group stage opponents Cameroon 2–0. The championship victory resulted in the team qualifying for the ensuing U-20 World Cup. In the tournament, Ayew scored twice against England in a 4–0 rout and the equalizing goal against South Africa in the round of 16. Ghana later won the match in extra time through a goal from Dominic Adiyiah. Ayew then captained the team to victories over the South Korea and Hungary in the quarter-finals and semi-finals, respectively, to reach the final where they faced Brazil. In the final, Ghana defeated the Brazilians 4–3 on penalties to win the U-20 World Cup. Ayew converted Ghana's first penalty in the shootout.  Senior  On 7 August 2007, Ayew was called up for the first time by Ghana coach Claude Le Roy for the team's friendly match against Senegal on 21 August. He made his international debut in the match, appearing as a late- match substitute. On 11 January 2008, Ayew was named to the Ghana squad to play in the 2008 Africa Cup of Nations. Ayew made his second major international tournament appearance by appearing at the 2010 Africa Cup of Nations. On 19 January 2010, in the team's final group stage match against Burkina Faso, he scored his first international goal in 30th minute with a header. Ghana won the match 1–0 and reached the final where they were defeated 1–0 by Egypt. Ayew appeared in all five matches the team contested. On 7 May 2010, Ayew was named to coach Milovan Rajevac's 30-man preliminary squad to participate in the 2010 FIFA World Cup. He was later named to the 23-man team to compete in the competition alongside his brother Ibrahim. On 12 June, Ayew made his FIFA World Cup debut in the team's opening group stage match against Serbia, starting ahead of the more experienced Sulley Muntari. He later started in the team's ensuing group stage matches against Australia and Germany. In the team's round of 16 match against the United States, Ayew assisted on the game-winning goal scored by Asamoah Gyan after sending a –pass into the United States defense, which Gyan collected and then converted. For his performance in the match, Ayew was named Man of the Match by FIFA. Ayew missed the team's quarter-final defeat on penalties to Uruguay due to yellow card accumulation. He went on to play in the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations, scoring against Mali and Tunisia, as the Black Stars finished in fourth place. In February 2013, Ayew retired from international football after a dispute with the Ghana Football Association. However, he returned to the team for a World Cup qualifier against Zambia on 6 September. He then went on to start in both legs of Ghana's 7–3 aggregate play-off defeat of Egypt to secure qualification to the 2014 FIFA World Cup. On 2 June 2014, Ayew was named in Ghana's squad for the World Cup. In the team's opening match, he scored an 82nd minute equalising goal against the United States in an eventual 2–1 defeat. He then scored the Black Stars' first goal in a 2–2 draw with Germany in their second group match. On 19 January 2015, Ayew scored Ghana's first goal of the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations in a 2–1 loss to Senegal.  Personal life  Ayew was born in Seclin, a commune in the arrondissement of Lille, to Ghanaian parents. Ayew comes from a family of footballers. His father, Abedi Pele, was a professional footballer and was playing for Lille at the time of his birth. He is the nephew of Kwame Ayew and Sola Ayew, both of whom are former international footballers. Ayew also has two brothers who are professional footballers; Ibrahim and Jordan, and a sister, Imani. Jordan currently plays for Crystal Palace and Ibrahim currently plays for Europa in Gibraltar. He is a practicing Muslim.  Charity work  On 26 July 2019, Ayew made donations to the Ghana under-20 team, which he captained to victory 10 years earlier.

He was born into a Lwów ArmenianArmenians in Lvov (in Russian) family, his father was of a stonemason, Stanisŀaw Ozimek, and educated at the cathedral school in the city. He began to work for the city chancellery and in 1624 changed his surname to Zimorowic in order to advance his career by distancing himself from his artisanal background. He married Katarzyna Duchnicówna, the daughter of a rich goldsmith (she died in 1653). In 1640, he took over the running of the city chancellery, became a councillor and was several times mayor of Lwów, which allowed him to take part in the election of King Jan Kazimierz in 1648. Zimorowic was interested in the history of Lwów and studied the city chronicles. In 1671 he published Viri illustres civitatis Leopoliensis (Famous Men of the City of Lwów), a collection of biographies of notable local figures. Another work, Leopolis triplex, tracing the history of Lwów until 1633, remained in manuscript until the late 19th century. When Zimorowic's most important collection of poems Sielanki nowe ruskie first appeared in 1663 the name on the title page was not Zimorowic's own but that of his younger brother Szymon, who had died in 1629. The reason for this misattribution is still a mystery (their true authorship was only discovered by August Bielowski in 1839). Szymon had written some pastoral poems of his own, published in 1654 under the title Roksolanki to jest ruskie panny (Roxolani, or Ruthenian Ladies). Some of the poems in Józef Bartłomiej's collection had been written as early as the 1620s and contain many references to the author's family and friends as well as political events of the time. It is possible that Zimorowic published them as a tribute to his wife on the tenth anniversary of her death. Zimorowic acknowledges the most important earlier Polish pastoral poet Szymon Szymonowic, whose Sielanki appeared in 1614, as his master, but his own poems are notable for their local, \\"Ruthenian\\" (i.e. Ukrainian) colour and are clearly set in the landscape around Lwów.

It was his last release for Polydor Records, after which he departed from that label and returned to Sony Music, on which the album Patience, including the song \\"Shoot the Dog\\", was released. The song is a protest song referring to (and critical of) British Prime Minister Tony Blair and American President George W. Bush. Released on 29 July 2002, it peaked at number one in Denmark and number 12 in the United Kingdom. The music video for the song is completely animated. The single marked twenty years since the release of Wham!'s first single, \\"Wham Rap! (Enjoy What You Do)\\", another politically charged song written by Michael. \\"Shoot the Dog\\" samples the Human League song \\"Love Action (I Believe in Love)\\". It also samples the \\"That's right!\\" vocal from Silver Convention's \\"Get Up and Boogie\\", as well as the \\"Gotta get up\\" vocal from Michael's own song, \\"Fastlove\\" (1996). Music video The music video featured animation provided by the satirical British cartoon series 2DTV. It originally premiered on ITV after the episode \\"Series 2, Episode 6\\" on 2 July 2002, and was the number-one music video on rotation on MTV between July and August 2002. Following the death of George Michael on 25 December 2016, the music video was broadcast by MTV Classic in the United States, and ITV in the United Kingdom on 26 December 2016 — ahead of a rerun of the movie Bee Movie — and featured a title card paying tribute to Michael. Synopsis The video starts off in the White House, where President George W. Bush is given an explanation about the current state of affairs in the world. Bush (depicted behaving like a naïve child) has not understood a word of it, so a general re explains everything with the use of a hand puppet. Then the song starts and George Michael enters the White House, leaving the men's toilet (in reference to the scandal of April 1998 where Michael was caught during a lewd act in a toilet). He, Bush and the general start dancing to the music before Michael leaves the scenery. In the next scene, Michael leaves his house (dressed like Homer Simpson) and is bullied by his neighbour and his dog. Back home that night, the neighbour goes on tormenting him by playing loud music, which irritates George Michael and his family members (who are all clones of himself, and are dressed like The Simpsons). Then Michael/Homer chases the dog with a water gun, only to be shot himself. Three drag queen versions of Michael (of which one of them looks like Marge Simpson) start dancing to the music, only to be bothered by Geri Halliwell. Next, Michael (as himself) walks to the White House lawn where President Bush throws a ball so his dog can fetch it. Prime Minister Tony Blair chases and fetches the ball instead, cuddled by Bush in reward. Michael continues his walk and enters Iraq where he accidentally steps on a missile, launched to England, while Saddam Hussein praises the act. Michael rides the missile (possibly in homage to Major Kong's final scene in Dr Strangelove), until it crashes in Blair's bedroom where Cherie Blair tries to get his attention, but Blair is only interested in Bush, who suddenly crawls into their bed. In the following scene, three versions of George Michael dance next to each other (all are references to other periods of his musical career). Back on the White House lawn, Blair tries to fetch another ball thrown by Bush, but it changes into a missile (in a reference to the video Californication) which then crashes into the Michael/Simpsons' house. There, Blair watches television with the family. Trevor McDonald announces a world war, but shrugs his shoulders not knowing what to do. Blair changes the channel to the Golden Jubilee, where Elizabeth II and Prince Charles are seen greeting people from the balcony of Buckingham Palace. Now with a hairstyle similar to Phil Oakey, Michael jumps on the balcony and starts dancing with The Queen and one of her corgis. Prince Charles tries to do the same, but moves completely out of rhythm. Then the Queen's crown falls of her head and lands on Charles'. He is excited, but then is bitten in the behind by the dog. Meanwhile, Michael jumps at two large groups of soldiers. He sticks flowers in their guns (a reference to the famous picture of hippie protesters by Bernie Boston) and then strips to his underwear, before jumping onto Cherie Blair's bed. She quickly changes the television channel, and the scene changes to the 2002 FIFA World Cup, with David Beckham and Paul Scholes playing soccer. Tony Blair appears in American football attire, and changes the football into an American football before leaving the stadium. Pierluigi Collina gives him a red card, while David Seaman starts crying with laughter. While Michael seduces Cherie, Tony Blair uses Great Britain as a speedboat to annex his country to the United States. In the final scene, Michael dances in a cowboy outfit, joined by Bush and Blair, before the two politicians leave the scene together. Then other clones of Michael jump in to join him, until they all resemble the Village People. Bush and Blair re-enter the scene dancing the tango together, and the song ends. Back at the White House, President Bush liked the song so much, that he asks his general to repeat everything. The general is not pleased.

Plastilinovaya vorona) is a 1981 Soviet clay animation by Aleksandr Tatarskiy (T/O Ekran studio). Animation divided into three independent parts (Picture, Game and But maybe, but maybe...). The film was Russia's first claymation film. Plot synopsis Picture The first part tells kids about the three painting styles – landscape, still life and portrait. Lyrics for the first part were written by Alexander Kushner and sung by Grigory Gladkov, who also composed whole cartoon. Song about the paintings Game The second part features the story of grandpa and his nephew playing the children game where the players periodically opens and shuts their eyes. And every time they are amazed with looking to something new in front of them. This part was based on lyrics by Ovsey Driz and performed by Leonid Bronevoy and Alesha Pavlov. Here I see... But maybe, but maybe... The final part is a parody of The Crow and the Fox, best known in Russian with the version by Krylov. The storytellers (Lev Shimelov and Aleksandr Levenbuk) can't remember the story plot, and they are trying to recall it. Thus, instead of the crow from Krylov's story, a dog appears, and then a cow, and even a hippopotamus. The original fox is also replaced by an ostrich and then by a street cleaner. At the end of the entirely distorted fable, a distorted moral is given: Don't stand and don't jump, don't sing and don't dance where there is construction in progress or heavy load hanging. (This is a pun on the two common Russian danger signs – \\"Don't stand under heavy load\\" and \\"Beware! Construction works in progress!\\"). The lyrics for the third part were written by Eduard Uspensky. But maybe Crow… Voice cast * Leonid Bronevoy * Grigory Gladkov * Lev Shimelov * Aleksandr Levenbuk * Alesha Pavlov Censorship At the time of release, the Soviet state officials wanted to ban the film because of (what they described) \\"ideological nonsense\\". Nevetheless, head of Kinopanorama television programme Xeniya Marinina and host and film director Eldar Ryazanov managed to show cartoon in one of editions of Kinopanorama on Soviet Central Television, bypassing the censorship. Production * Creation of the film required about 800 kg of soviet plasticine. Because of withered colors the plasticine was dye-colored. * The music in the third part of the film was intended to sound in the ordinary tempo, but its total length appeared to be longer than the animation created (8 minutes instead of 5). While Tatarskiy was in doubt, the voices arrived. Then the genius decision came when Tatarskiy remembered how the gramophone-recorded voice of Lenin was restored by varying speed of phonation. He griped the recording to the necessary length (5 min), and the song acquired its recognisable sounding. * The music in the third part is borrowing heavily from the Irish folk song Whiskey in the Jar. The beginning of the second verse of the song (\\"Но тут лиса бежала...\\") in this part is based on George Harrison's song My Sweet Lord.

Biography  Macleay was born in London, the third son of Alexander Macleay and educated at Westminster School. He came to Australia in 1826. In November 1829 he accompanied Charles Sturt on his second expedition to the mouth of the Murray River and back. Early in April 1830, after difficulties on the expedition and the whole party was practically exhausted, Sturt recorded that \\"amidst these distresses Macleay preserved his good humour and did his utmost to lighten the toil and to cheer the men\\". Macleay and Sturt remained good friends and corresponded regularly until Sturt's death in 1869. Macleay then lived on and farmed the Brownlow estate, near Camden, and also established a property at Fish River, between Goulburn and Yass from 1831 to 1859. In 1854 Macleay was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Council for the Pastoral District of Murrumbidgee. In 1856 the unicameral Legislative Council was abolished and replaced with an elected Legislative Assembly and an appointed Legislative Council and Macleay was elected to the Legislative Assembly for Murrumbidgee. He was a conservative. He declined a ministry position in Henry Parker's brief premiership in 1857. In 1859 Macleay returned to England where he was elected a fellow of the Linnean Society in 1860. He spent the remainder of his life in the south of France apart from returning briefly to Sydney in 1873 to finalise his affairs there. He also travelled in his steam yacht to the Greek islands, Turkey and Syria. Macleay was also a keen zoologist, he donated fossil specimens he collected from the Murrumbidgee River to the Australian Museum. He was also a museum trustee and contributed to Richard Owen's book on the fossils of Australia. On his 1873 visit, he collected a Queensland lungfish or Ceratodus forsteri (now called Neoceratodus forsteri) and took it back to London for T. H. Huxley to dissect and describe in an 1876 paper which identified the supplier as \\"my friend Sir George Macleay ... on a recent visit to Australia\\". Charles Sturt named the Rufus River in south-western New South Wales in Macleay's honour, as he had red hair, and Point McLeay was (mis-)named for him by T. B. Strangways and Hutchinson in 1837. Macleay was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in 1869 and knighted KCMG in 1875. He died at Menton, France, on 24 June 1891.

They explore the cultural and ideological bases of development in Kerala and the shifts in culture and ideology that shape particular development outcomes. The history of the shaping of public consent for state-sponsored artificial birth- control, the discursive dimensions of community assertion in development, the sub-nationalist ideology bolstered by developmentalism forming the basis of post-independence Kerala, and the discursive dimensions of gender and development have been actively explored at CDS. These studies have mostly relied on archival research and importantly, textual analysis, as their principal methods. Essentially, they represent interdisciplinary research at CDS which has appeared in a whole range of internationally and nationally renowned research journals across the social sciences and humanities. They examine the intertwining of development, politics, culture, and social institutions in Kerala that significantly shape the people’s well-being. Other studies include those on the cultural and historical aspects of women’s mobility into politics and paid work. Recent studies include those of the impacts of extraneous cultural flows that shaped Kerala’s specific historical experience of socio-political change in the twentieth century facilitated by mobility across colonial and post colonial geographies. #Decentralization and Governance: Since the 1990s when the 73rd and 74th Amendments of the Indian Constitution came into force, decentralisation and local governance have been crucial to questions of welfare and development in India. This coincided with an interest in developing planning from below in ways that deepened democracy in Kerala, and with accelerated urban expansion in Kerala and elsewhere. Also, the coming of decentralised democracy meant the expansion of opportunities for women, both in the elected local bodies through reservations and in self-help groups. Research at CDS has followed these processes from different disciplinary perspectives and different methodological perspectives. Major projects that focused on local level development since the 1990s have been carried out. Studies have ranged from changing institutional structures of local governance, welfare programmes and redistribution, social security, infrastructural development, to local government finances. The Research Unit on Local Self-Government at CDS has been carrying out research on agriculture and local self-government and on environmental challenges in urban areas. Gender has been a key theme in research on local government at CDS. This has included research on elected women leaders in Kerala’s rural and urban local bodies, gender budgeting in panchayats, and the state-wide network of women’s self-help groups under the Kerala State Poverty Alleviation Mission, the Kudumbashree. Recent work includes research into the opportunities opened by decentralisation for women of the most marginal communities in Kerala and the ways in which these women have availed of them. A small but significant theme that is emergent is about the challenges in urban governance in a rapidly- urbanizing Kerala. Studies on urban housing schemes implemented by local governments are ongoing. #Gender and Development: Research in this domain has been quite diverse in terms of themes and disciplinary orientations. At present, there is cross disciplinary and/or interdisciplinary research that brings a gender perspective to bear on problems of labour, livelihoods, politics, health, migration and marriage. Gendered power relations were implicated even when not explicitly probed in the early research at the Centre (1970s) on questions of fertility transition and human development. Even as research in the 1980s and 1990s brought a clear focus on women’s work and employment, including the implications of wider definitions of work for computing national income, on women in agriculture and fisheries, and on understanding how women made good in the context of large scale male migration to the Middle East. The evolution of the CDS research agenda through critical engagement with earlier perspectives on development has been particularly marked in the case of the research on gender and caste since 2000. Gender in contemporary Kerala has been the focus of significant research. Recent research on gender and politics in Kerala has addressed decentralised governance, feminisation of local governance and student politics in higher educational institutions. Gendered livelihoods have come into focus in the context of self-help initiatives of women even as the persisting low female work participation in India and Kerala has continued to receive attention. There is ongoing work on state policy and the implication of gender and caste / religious identities in international migration of women workers from South India. #Human Development, Health and Education: Human development continues to be a celebrated theme of enquiry at the Centre for the state’s paradoxical distinction in this regard which compares with the developed world. The challenge of human development in the state unfolds perspectives like its sustainability in the long run as well as its virtues of inclusion. The compulsion of shrinking social sector investment coupled with public provisioning of health and education getting complemented by private provisioning poses a threat to sustainability and furthering of its achievements. Enquiries in the field of Health and education remain beyond their instrumental role in the assessment of human development. Topics of health research span from understanding economic of health and health care to equity, pricing and health system analysis in keeping with the evolving epidemiological transition. The alternative dimensions of health research include assessment of disease burden, modes of care provisioning during ultimate years of life along with concerns of sustaining better health indicators in the event of population ageing that is underway. With an evolving public-private mix in the provisioning of health care, health care decision making in consideration of cost and quality has been another prominent engagement in the field of health research. Allied topics like under-nutrition, dietary diversification as well as over/under utilisation of health care are also examined towards commenting upon the healthy makeup of the society. Similarly, works relating to the theme of education involves assessment of educational progress with its varied facets of characteristic inclusion, connections with the emerging labour market and educated unemployment, etc. Issues concerning quality of education, higher education and technical education too are highlights of Centre’s work in the field of education. The significance of enquiries in these two vital areas of human capability needs strengthening with theoretical formulations based on economic principles beyond the empirics that have been our strength till date. #Industry and Trade: Issues related to industry, trade and investments comprise one of the core areas of research at the Centre. Research related to industry specifically look into various aspects including performance of the Indian corporate sector, role of MNCs in Indian manufacturing sector, spill over effects of FDI inflows, implications of Global Value Chain, mergers and acquisitions, etc. There have been a number of studies specific to sectors like electronics, pharmaceutical, capital goods, paper, tea, etc. Another set of studies analyse issues like frugal innovation, STI policies, R&D; tax incentives and IPR policy. Issues like competition policy, corporate governance, regional concentration and urban formation, diffusion of automation, innovation, disinvestments and CSR have also been well researched upon. #Innovation and Technology: The role of innovation in fostering and sustaining economic growth of nation states is now fairly well established. Innovation is the commercial introduction of new processes and products, essentially by firms. There are two different aspects of innovation that has merited the attention of researchers. First, is the generation of innovation and second is its diffusion within the economy. It was initially believed that the generation and diffusion of innovation happened in splendid isolation by the firm through its investments in R&D.; However, towards the beginning of the 1990s, this view of generation and diffusion of innovation has undergone many radical changes. A number of research studies reflective these five concerns or dimensions are currently undertaken at the Centre. #Labour, Employment and Social Security: Research in CDS on this theme has a long history with a wide canvass, that is continuously evolving both in terms of research themes and methodological approaches. In line with the prevailing economic structures of early 1970s research in CDS had contextualised the structural transformation including agrarian transformation in Kerala and focused on questions of agrarian structure and labour relations; emerging industrial workforce and industrial relations; and labour market outcomes. #Macroeconomic performance: Studies under this theme can be classified into those focusing on long term macroeconomic performance of Indian economy and those analysing short run macroeconomic issues such as monetary policy and inflation. Studies belonging to the first category focused on issues like long term growth performance of Indian economy. These studies made an attempt to identify and explain the growth phases of Indian economy. One study tries to explain these growth phases in terms of cumulative causation emerging out of positive feedback between producer services sectors and manufacturing sector. Another study examines the role of the crisis, change in economic policy regime and export performance in the growth trajectory of Indian economy. A third one analysed the relationship between public policy and economic growth in the Indian context. #Migration: Linkages between migration, economic growth, income distribution, and social change. #Plantation Crops: Research on plantation sector in CDS is being undertaken at the instance of the National Research Programme on Plantation Development sponsored by the Ministry of Commerce. The programme is expected to undertake policy oriented research on all aspects of plantation sector in India and help research capacity building. #Politics and Development: Studies in this theme have considered the larger questions of shifting relationships between the state, political society and the formal political public, and particular regimes of development, particularly, development policy. The shifts in politics, welfare, and the move from government to governance that characterised the 1990s have been of considerable interest here. Studies that reflect on the politics of the shift from centralised government to decentralised governance, and of the political economy of agrarian change in the wake of the intensifying impacts of globalising neoliberal capitalism, the politics of gender emergent in urban governance, have been carried out. Also, historical work on the politics of welfare in pre- and post-independence Kerala, on marginalisation, exclusion, and abjection in development particularly with reference to dalit people and sexual minorities, and local histories on politics and development in micro- sites of extreme marginalisation and deprivation in Kerala have been published. These studies too constitute a significant part of the interdisciplinary research at CDS in the recent decades. Methodologically, most of these studies employ a diverse set of tools.

In certain ways, a metabolic pathway is similar to a factory assembly line. Products are assembled from parts by workers who each perform a specific step in the manufacturing process. Enzymes of a cell are like workers on an assembly line; each is only responsible for a particular step in the assembly process. A lag period also occurs when a new factory is constructed, a time period before finished products begin to roll off the assembly line at a steady rate. This lag period partially results from the time needed to fill supply bins with the necessary parts. As you might imagine, when parts are not readily available, production slows or stops. Metabolite pools are somewhat analogous to the parts bins of a factory.

Plot Sociologist Dr. Homer Crawford, for many years a tyrant of North and most of Central Africa, under the name of El Hassan, faces a military coup led by his closest supporters, Bey-ag-Akhamouk and Elmer Allen, who believe Crawford is an impediment to Africa's progress because he opposes foreign aid and investment in the region. Promised a pension and safe passage if he submits, Crawford leaves Africa to retire to Switzerland with his wife Isobel and three sons Tom, Cliff, and Abraham. After thwarting an assassination attempt by army officers on board his aeroplane, he makes it safely to Switzerland. Once there, his son Abraham reminds him that many of El Hassan's detractors (who include Abraham himself) were merely responding to his unwillingness to move from a dictatorship to a democratic government. Six months later, a now frustrated semi-alcoholic Crawford learns of a counter- coup in Africa by a dissident army cabal led by his old arch-enemy Abd-el- Kader. Most of the junta that deposed him have been shot, but Elmer Allen has managed to make it through to meet Crawford in Switzerland. Realizing that Abd-el-Kader will revoke his progressive programs, Crawford decides to contact his closest associates and return to North Africa in disguise. Allen and Abraham decide to accompany him. The group rendezvous with Crawford's associates in an afforestation project in what was Southern Algeria. Crawford reveals that his plan for a counter-coup consists of a guerrilla campaign to divert Abd-el-Kader's troops so that Abraham has time to organize the country's youth to form a new political organization against the ruling colonels. When Abraham expresses surprise at the plan, Crawford explains that his time has passed, and that now it is up to the next generation to revolt against the status quo. In a flashback of his last conversation with Isobel, we learn that Crawford does not believe he will survive the revolution this time around.

It was built in 1896 following two decades of problems with structure fires in the village. The current water tower is the result of a second attempt after the first structure proved to be unstable. The tower stands tall and is built of limestone and red brick. The current stainless steel water tank holds 50,000 gallons (190,000 liters) and replaced the original wooden tank in 1984. The site has two other structures, an old power plant building and a 100,000 US gallon (380,000 l) reservoir. The Lena Electric Plant Building was constructed in 1905 and the reservoir completed in 1907. The Lena Water Tower was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1997; the reservoir was included as a contributing property to the listing. History The need for a water tower in Lena was the topic of newspaper editorials many years before the current structure was actually built in 1896. In the early 1870s fires struck a stable, a warehouse, a rural school and several houses in and around Lena. The 1871 Great Chicago Fire induced a sense of panic among many Illinoisians, including those in the village of Lena. In 1874 fire nearly destroyed the freight house and depot owned by the Illinois Central Railroad in Lena. The fires continued through the 1870s and 1880s and the Lena Star editorials led the crusade to build a water tower. The week of June 14, 1895 workers began drilling for the new reservoir and water tower. The drill reached in depth and became stuck. It was not freed until October 1895 and work crews were forced to work double shifts to compensate. The tower structure itself began rising by early November when disaster struck the project. As a rock was being hoisted up the tower it crashed to the ground ripping through the first two floors of the structure. When a winter thaw hit the area on December 25 the mortar on the building began to crumble; the unseasonable thaw had weakened poorly mixed mortar. Citizens were outraged and blamed the newspaper for pushing the tower so furiously. The paper, in turn, blamed the faulty work of the contractor; the foundation was not large enough to support the mass of the tower structure. In June 1896 village trustees voted to hire U.S. Wind, Engine and Pump Company from Batavia, Illinois to demolish the unstable water tower and rebuild it with a properly founded structure. On June 19, 1896 the company arrived to demolish the old structure and begin laying a new foundation using Portland cement. The tower had risen by July and by September the brick portion of the facade was completed at . By October 1896 the cypress water tank was installed atop the Lena Water Tower.Welton, Sharon. \\"Lena Water Tower,\\" (PDF), National Register of Historic Places Nomination Form, 30 September 1996, HAARGIS Database, Illinois Historic Preservation Agency.

Six stone buttresses flank the first of the water tower as well. The beyond the limestone portion of the facade is faced in red brick. The limestone was quarried east of the village. Atop the brick of the current Lena Water Tower is a stainless steel tank which is held in place only by the weight of the water inside. The current tank replaced the old wooden water tank in 1984 and is painted black with \\"LENA\\" spelled out in large yellow letters across its face. The tank is tall and in diameter; it holds 50,000 gallons (189,271 l) of water and is ringed by a metal catwalk. Other structures Lena Electric Light Plant Building Electric Light Plant Building was constructed in 1905. There is one building on the Lena Water Tower site. The Electric Light Plant Building was constructed in 1905 by the Benfield Brothers for developer W.M. Arnold and it housed the Lena Electric Light Plant. By 1920 the building had two additions; in 1912 a brick addition was added to the building's south elevation to house a steam engine and boiler, the 1920 addition was of brick and on the Electric Plant's north elevation. The hip roof is clad in asphalt shingles while the wooden soffits have been covered with aluminum, another of the alterations through the years. The original structure featured doors and windows that have since been bricked over and altered. From east to west on the original south elevation was a by doorway, four windows, a doorway, another door, and two windows. The north and west facades had two windows and the south elevation another large doorway. In 1978 Pierce Construction of Lena was hired to completely or partially brick over all doors and windows on the building. A new windowed, wooden door was installed in a new opening on the east facade of the Electric Plant. The building had two more additions in 1982. A red brick addition with an by garage door was added to the north elevation and a shed addition with a by garage door was added to the southeast elevation, both built in 1982. Reservoir The on site reservoir was completed in 1907 and is connected to the old Electric Plant Building through two cast iron pipes. The 100,000 gallon (378,541 l) reservoir is constructed from concrete and features a roof of wood and metal. Significance The Lena Water Tower has been in continuous service since it was built in 1896 and is the tallest structure in the village. Its role in providing the citizens of Lena with water services beginning in 1896 is the primary reason the structure was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on February 20, 1997.National Register of Historic Places, National Park Service. Retrieved 15 May 2011. Included in the listing to the National Register was the reservoir, which was added as a contributing property. The Electric Plant Building, however, was not included in the listing because of the large number of modern alterations it has undergone. The Lena Water Tower is believed to be one of three in the state of Illinois designed and built of similar construction and has become a symbol of the village of Lena.

There is mention of Evelyn in a letter by Mary Sloan to her sister on 27 April 1912, stating that they both were taken to Dr. Simpson's room for a little whiskey and water during the disaster. Dr. Simpson then hurried away and was never seen by them again. Evelyn and Mary escaped on Boat 16 which was lowered at 1.35 a.m. from the Port side by 6th Officer Moody. This boat held about 40 people with no incidents recorded while loading.Lifeboats They were in this boat all night until picked them up, at about seven in the morning. George Robinson, the uncle of Evelyn Marsden was also noted as being aboard the Titanic. Youth As a youth, she learned to row a boat against the tides and currents of the Murray River while visiting a farm at Murray Bridge, South Australia. Evelyn worked as a Probationer Nurse at the Royal Adelaide Hospital (then known as the Adelaide Hospital) between 15 January and 11 November 1907. Her salary was twelve pounds per annum and she was given apartment rations, fuel, light, and a uniform. From 8 May 1907 to 5 June 1907, Evelyn went on sick leave with full pay for about a month due to contracting gangrene of the finger whilst on duty.

Vellamunda Panchayath Office is situated at Ettenalu (Literally translated to 8/4, which signifies that this place is located at a distance of 8 miles and 4 furlongs from Mananthavady).  Etymology  The name Vellamunda is derived from 'Vellamunda Idam', which was the Tharavad of Vattathod family, the landlords of these areas in the days of Jenmi rule.  History  The areas that constitute the present-day Vellamunda were ruled by the Puliya Kingdom before the days of Pazhassi Raja. The Puliyan Nair Clan(Polighar), which inherited control of these areas, were not very popular among the commons. This led to unrests from the Naduvazhis (Lords) of sub-divisions of the place, namely, Mangalassery, Vattathod, Cherukara, Karingari, and Tharuvana, who approached Pazhassi Raja with a request to overthrow the Puliya Clan. Pazhassi duly obliged and defeated them, subsequently adding the area to The Kingdom of Kottayam. It is believed that Mangalassery Hills served as one of the bases for his guerilla warfare against the British. In 1950, Chondarnad (Present-day Thondarnad) and Vellamunda villages were merged to form Vellamunda Grama Panchayat, which was reorganized in 1961 by removing Thondarnad and adding Porunnannur.  Location and Connectivity  Vellamunda is located on the Mananthavady-Kuttiyady route, and is well connected to nearby towns by roads. Kozhikode (83 km away) is accessible via the Kuttiyady Churam while the district capital Kalpetta, which is at a distance of approximately 30 km, can be reached via Padinjarathara.

Course and features Formed by the confluence of the Kedron and Cedar Creeks that drain the D'Aguilar Range within the southern portion of the D'Aguilar National Park, Kedron Brook rises below the retail shopping strip, near the outer suburb of Upper Kedron and flows in an easterly direction. Kedron Brook then meanders through suburbs including Stafford, Grange, Lutwyche, Wooloowin, Kalinga Park, Toombul and Hendra before it empties into the Schulz Canal, which flows into Moreton Bay at . The river descends over its course and has a catchment area of . For much of its length, Kedron Brook is lined with parks and sporting facilities such as bikeways and football fields. Kedron Brook has been channelised where it passes suburbs such as Lutwyche and Wooloowin. Tidal influence reaches as far as Toombul. The original course of Kedron Brook has been significantly altered in the vicinity of Brisbane Airport, where it has been redirected to a canal named the Schulz Canal. This was done to allow expansion of the airport in recent decades. The canal empties into Moreton Bay adjacent to the small bayside village of Nudgee Beach. At the lower end of the catchment, Boondall Wetlands is an internationally recognised habitat (RAMSAR site) for migratory wader birds and other animals in Moreton Bay.

Aston Villa had won the inaugural competition in 1960–61, and had beaten Birmingham 4–0 in their most recent League meeting, while Birmingham were seeking to win their first major trophy. Birmingham won 3–1 on aggregate, with all the goals coming in the first leg. Match summary The first leg took place on 23 May 1963 at Birmingham's home ground, St Andrew's. Birmingham took the lead when Harris fed Auld who crossed for Ken Leek's powerful shot, but Aston Villa equalised via Bobby Thomson. Seven minutes into the second half, the same combination of players made it 2–1, and after 66 minutes Jimmy Bloomfield met a Harris cross to score off the post to give Birmingham a 3–1 lead. The second leg four days later at Villa Park was goalless. With former England centre half Trevor Smith marking Thomson out of the game and Birmingham's defensive tactics including regularly kicking the ball out for throw-ins, Aston Villa were unable to break their opponents down.

The organization currently consists of a 900 volunteer members as well as 17 regional offices, all of which are based in France. The group is frequently mentioned on various media such as social media sites, television, and print. SOS Homophobie provides national support programs including an anonymous hotline, testimonials on websites and support offered through postal mail. The main objectives of the organization are to support those who have fallen victim to homophobia and to run homophobia prevention events. Moreover, the organization aims to ultimately achieve equality between homosexual and heterosexual couples, and equal treatment for people despite sexual orientation. History SOS Homophobie was initially established on 11 April 1994 as a solely volunteer-only based initiative. The goal was to develop a helpline for LGBT individuals of France. In 1997 yearly reports were written and continue to be made each year. A webpage has been made in order for youth to clarify their understanding of LGBT. Fields of activity Between 2010 and 2011, SOS Homophobie took part in various events aiming to protect and raise public awareness of the rights of LGBT people. The following are examples of such: * The Trail of Sexualities in Lyon * The International Day against Homophobia * The Gay Pride LGBT and Gay Prides in Paris and the region * The Day of the Fight against AIDS * LGBT Associations Printemps in Paris or the first LGBT Salon de Lille. SOS Homophobie continues to be actively involved regarding issues related to the LGBT community. In 2012, counsel, Caroline Mecary, represented the association and responded to France’s Constitutional Council deferral decision on gay marriage. She claims that \\"it is probably necessary to wait for an alternative policy in 2012, so that the parties of the Left, which are favorable to the opening of marriage and adoption for same-sex couples, initiate a reform.\\" Cooperation From 2006 and beyond, SOS Homophobie has met with representatives of several influential LGBT organizations – MANEO (Germany), Lambda Warsaw (Poland), and KPH Kampania Przewic Homofobie (Poland). The groups have held conferences in which they discussed relevant issues. Together they have joined to achieve a common purpose - to fight against homophobia and support the creation of a world with increased equality. They signed a joint declaration, the “Tolerancja Declaration”, to achieve these goals. The objectives of the “Tolerancja Declaration” are as such: *Regular expert meetings to exchange ideas and suggestions for project implementation *Improvements in the recording of and assessment of homophobia related violence in respective countries *Promotion of the “International Day Against Homophobia” (May 17) with actions and events *A joint European prize, the “Tolerantia Prize”, to be given to individual(s) for their efforts in protecting the rights and freedoms of homosexuals’ In 2008, four groups agreed to cooperate with the Spanish gay-Lesbian organizations TRIANGULO and COGAM in the “Berliner Bündnis gegen Homophobie und Hassgewalt(Berlin Alliance Against Homophobia and Hate Violence)” in order to increase networks and strengthen their initiatives. Areas of work *Online Testimonies **Collect and gather information through listening to different communication channels like the anonymous hotline services, to create online testimonies. *Annual Reports **Published annual reports to tackle the issues that arise from homophobia in France. *School Intervention **Provide sufficient training for volunteers prior to setting up debates with students to solve their confusion with regards to homophobia. The aim to promote the idea of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender to prevent students from participating in gender discriminatory acts, bullying and violent acts. *Internet Regulation **To stop the rapid spread of LGBT discrimination prominent on certain webpages. It focuses mainly on Twitter with hastags like “TeamHomophobe” and “#UnGayMort”.

What is a conservator?\\". American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC). www.conservation-us.org. Retrieved 2017-05-29. Conservators possess the expertise to preserve cultural heritage in a way that retains the integrity of the object, building or site, including its historical significance, context and aesthetic or visual aspects.Defining the Conservator: Essential Competencies. (2003). Retrieved from http://www.conservation- us.org/docs/default-source/governance/defining-the-conservator-essential- competencies.pdf?sfvrsn=1. This kind of preservation is done by analyzing and assessing the condition of cultural property, understanding processes and evidence of deterioration, planning collections care or site management strategies that prevent damage, carrying out conservation treatments, and conducting research.Careers in Conservation. (2014). Retrieved from http://www.conservation-us.org/publications-resources/careers-in- conservation/become-a-conservator#.VPPIxMaLTwN. A conservator's job is to ensure that the objects in a museum's collection are kept in the best possible condition, as well as to serve the museum's mission to bring art before the public.Neuman, R. (2011). MFA Highlights: Conservation and Care of Museum Collections. Boston, MA: Museum of Fine Arts.  Conservation and restoration  Essentially, the term \\"conservation\\" refers to a manner of care or treatment that repairs damage and also takes action to prevent or slow down further deterioration of an object.Landry, G. (2000). The Wintertbur Guide to Caring for Your Collection. Winterthur, Delaware, DE: Winterthur Museum. The term \\"restoration\\" refers to a manner of care or treatment in which the goal is to bring an object back to its original appearance or function. \\"Restoration\\" can be part of the care and treatment of an object and is a subset of the umbrella term \\"conservation\\". Both terms come into play when it comes to the treatment and care of all cultural heritage.  Responsibilities and duties  Use of a microscope to examine the condition of an artwork Conservators and restorers care for, manage, treat, preserve, and document many different historical items including artifacts, art, and specimens.Baker, G. D. (2015). How to Become a Museum Conservator. Retrieved from http://collegemouse.com/jobs/how-to-become-a-museum-conservator.html. * Examining artifacts, both visually and using scientific tools such as x-rays, infrared photography and microscopic analysis to determine the extent and causes of deterioration.Johnston, L. (2013). Museum/gallery conservator job description. Retrieved from http://www.prospects.ac.uk/museum_gallery_conservator_job_description.htm. Conservation science (sometimes called museum science) aids every aspect of a museum's mission to study its collections, both inside and out of the laboratory. * Maintaining full conservation records by documenting the condition of an object or site, including any previous restoration work and to outline treatment methods and materials in detail. Documentation ensures the careful recording of treatment procedures and materials so there can be no misunderstanding in the future about what is part of the original work of art and what has been added or altered by the conservator * Producing a visual record of the object for identification purposes and to illustrate its condition. The examination of the object, treatment proposal, and the actual treatment is documented with written reports and photographs * Monitoring and recording display and storage conditions with the aim of keeping objects in a stable condition. Preservation is the ultimate goal of conservation. By taking into account the possible day-to-day stresses caused by an object's environment, museum conservators do their best to preserve art for generations to come. * Proposing and estimating the costs of treatments to halt decay and stabilize an artifact. Conservators, present a proposal for work to be done as well as a report on the completion of the treatment. * Restoration to bring a deteriorated or damaged object or structure closer to a previous or assumed appearance or function. Although conservators cannot exactly recapture the original appearance, they are able to make highly educated decisions about how to restore an object if they identify the materials from which it was made and fully understand their properties. * Organizing the logistics of long-term projects and collaborating with other conservators. This collaboration can take place when items are on loan or when outside help is needed for complex conservation projects. * Working out creative solutions to clean, support and repair sensitive objects. Ultimately, just as every object is unique, every conservation decision must be considered on its own and on a case-by-case basis. * Developing and maintaining appropriate standards within the specialist area. Critical information can be lost and an object permanently damaged when things are cared for without basic guidelines and information. * Keeping up to date with the latest conservation techniques and practices, through research and training. Conservation is a young profession, which means it continues to evolve over time and conservators must be able to keep up to date with the latest trends. * Advising on procedures for the safe exhibition and travel of cultural materials . Museum conservators strive to maintain the integrity of each work of art throughout its life, whenever it is handled, stored, displayed, or shipped to other locations for exhibitions. * Direct and supervise curatorial, technical, and student staff in the handling, mounting, care, and storage of art objects. Other museum departments look to conservators and restorers for direction on safety procedures when it comes to objects in the museum's collection. * Recommend preservation procedures, such as control of temperature and humidity, to curatorial and building staff. The most important step you can take to ensure the preservation of any collection is to create a safe display and storage environment that will not cause further deterioration of the objects.  Knowledge and skills  * Working knowledge of the vocabulary of conservation and scientific methodology in order to effectively examine an object, assess its state, understand its history, and articulate its needs. * Must have a firm grasp of philosophical precepts expressed in the AIC Code of Ethics and Guidelines for Practice in order to formulate a treatment. The conservator must understand that it's important to respect the integrity of the object and that his or her actions should not jeopardize the long-term preservation of the object. * Understanding and appreciation of the aesthetic, cultural, economic, historical, political, religious, scientific, and social values of objects, buildings and sites. This understanding and appreciation are critically important when devising preservation and conservation plans, strategies, and treatments. * Working knowledge of how materials constituting cultural heritage were acquired, modified, processed, or manufactured and how craft or manufacturing techniques and processes have evolved through time. * Possess knowledge of the chemical and physical properties and long-term behavior of a wide range of materials and whether these materials were used in the original fabrication of an object or in its subsequent treatment and preservation. * Must be aware of issues that arise from the ways that culturally significant materials will be accessed or used by society. * Knowledge of the context in which cultural heritage is used, as context may be critically important to understanding its condition, formulating appropriate treatment and recommending future care. * Knowledgeable about safety in the workplace and must carry out his or her practice in compliance with federal, state, and logical regulations. * Working knowledge of scientific principles as they apply to conservation, including how to access and use scientific literature and how to assess the validity of published research in conservation and allied fields. * Ability to recognize and understand the changes that occur in cultural heritage over time and be able to distinguish the cause of the changes (natural, chemical, physical, biological, or by human influence). * Versed in the many ways in which light, relative humidity, temperature, and pollutants can influence the long-term preservation of cultural heritage and must be familiar with techniques, equipment, and resources that can assist in managing these important environmental factors * Ability to conduct a safe, thorough examination of cultural materials in order to gather relevant information about their condition and to formulate an appropriate plan for preservation and treatment. * Know which tools and techniques are appropriate, how extensive the examination should be, and how or whether to perform external, intrusive, and occasionally destructive sampling. * Understand the purposes of documentation and must be knowledgeable and proficient in appropriate methods of written and pictorial documentation as well as in the maintenance and preservation of the body of information produced during examination and treatment. * Awareness of various treatment methods available as well as their effects on different types of cultural heritage, based on an understanding of condition, natural use, cultural, historic, and scientific significance, and, if applicable, the artist's or maker's intent.  Education and training   Undergraduate and graduate education  Conservators can receive training through apprenticeships, internships and graduate programs. In order to be accepted into a graduate program in the United States, they will need to fulfill some undergraduate prerequisites. This includes undergraduate coursework in science, the humanities (art history, anthropology, and archaeology), and studio art. Some graduate programs may also require internship, volunteer, apprenticeship, or paid conservation experience. Many may also require a personal interview where candidates are asked to present a portfolio of art and conservation project work that demonstrates manual dexterity and familiarity with techniques and materials. Graduate programs generally require two to four years of study, which can also include a full-time internship in the final year where students work under the guidance of experienced conservators. There are also a limited number of Ph.D. programs for advanced study in conservation.

Continued professional development  The specialty of conservation is ever-changing and evolving, which means that practicing conservators must stay up-to-date of advances in technology and methodology. Conservators usually expand their knowledge through reading publications, attending professional meetings, and enrolling in short-term workshops or courses. AIC offers many workshops, conferences, and online courses and tutorials.\\"Professional Development Courses in Conservation Education\\".

Conservation OnLine (CoOL) also offers resources for conservation professionals.\\"Welcome to CoOL\\". Conservation OnLine (CoOL). cool.conservation-us.org. Retrieved 2017-05-29.  Areas of specialty  Some conservators specialize in a particular material or group of objects, such as archaeology, ceramics and glass, furniture and wood, gilding and decorative surfaces, historic interiors, metals, paintings, paper and books, photographic materials, stained glass, stone and wall paintings, textiles, sculptures, and architecture. *Archaeological conservation *Architectural conservation *Books, manuscripts, and documentation conservation *Ceramic conservation *Glass conservation *Historic garden conservation *Historic Site conservation *Ivory conservation *Metal conservation *Musical instrument conservation *Painting conservation *Photograph conservation *Textile conservation *Wooden furniture conservation Ceramics conservation  Ethics  The primary goal for conservators and restorers is the preservation of cultural property. In order to achieve this goal, conservators abide by a code of ethics and guidelines that establish the principles that guide conservation professionals and others who are involved in the care of cultural property. An example of a code of ethics and guidelines for practice were created by the American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC).\\"Code of Ethics and Guidelines for Practive\\" (2015). American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC). www.conservation-us.org. Retrieved 2017-05-29. One of the most important principles in a conservator's code of ethics is that treatments should be reversible, which means that one must be able to undo any treatment in the future. Conservators strive to only minimize interventions and not completely alter an object during restoration. Conservation focuses on the material aspects of art, and respect for original materials remains a crucial element of the field's ethics.

The building is typical of the Classical Ottoman period and of the \\"Sinan School\\" of Ottoman religious architecture. It is located in the Üsküdar neighborhood of Istanbul. The main part of the building is square-shaped and covered with a flattened main dome and four half domes. The mosque has two minarets with two balconies each. Calligraphy inside the mosque is the work of Hezarfen Mehmet Efendi. The mosque has an octagonal base with a central dome. Its plan is a variant of that of the Rüstem Pasha Mosque, but variations such as its corner domes give it a more classical character than the Rüstem Pasha Mosque. It is also one of the earliest examples of the 18th-century trend towards domes that were proportionally higher and narrower. The cross vault over the central opening is an innovation first seen in this mosque. Rather than the five domes over the entrance portico – typical for Ottoman mosques – the Yeni Valide employs a cross vault over a central bay and cloister vaults over side bays. The interior decoration consists of stone carvings including muqarnas – intricate stone carvings with floral motifs – and tiles with repetitive floral patterns. The windows of the mosque make use of both pointed and curved arches. Those below the domes are pointed, creating the visual effect of pushing the domes upwards. The windows in the domes have rounded arches, which creates the visual effect of the dome pushing downwards on the structure beneath. Both the entryway and the octagonal fountain (shadirvan) in the courtyard make liberal use of very detailed stone carvings and the tomb of Gülnûş features an open top and intricate metal latticework. The primary school is located above the north gate to the mosque complex.

The Grade II* listed neoclassical villa was the residence of William and Elizabeth Gaskell from 1850 till their deaths in 1884 and 1865 respectively.Images of England: 84 Plymouth Grove, Chorlton-On- Medlock The Gaskell household continued to occupy the villa after the deaths of Elizabeth and William. The death of Elizabeth Gaskell's daughter, Margaret Emily \\"Meta\\" Gaskell, in 1913, brought to an end the Gaskells' residence there. The house itself was granted listed building status in 1952, partly due to its association with the Gaskells. This granted it protection from demolition, however, 84 Plymouth Grove slowly descended into a state of disrepair due to neglect. The Manchester Historic Buildings Trust commenced a restoration project in 2009, aiming to see 84 Plymouth Grove returned to its state as the Gaskells left it. By 2011, the Trust had finished the exterior, which included structural repairs and removing the pink paint that had coated the house for various years. However, in May 2011 their project was marred by the theft of the lead roof, which caused \\"extensive damage\\" according to the BBC. On completion of the £2.5m restoration, the building was reopened to the public on 5 October 2014. History 84 Plymouth Grove was designed in the Greek Revival style, probably by architect Richard Lane, circa 1838, and was speculatively built as part of a wider development catering to the burgeoning middle-classes in the area, then on the outskirts of the city. The villa comprised drawing and dining rooms, seven bedrooms and a coach house wing. The lavish house was built in response to the newly emerging middle class citizens of Manchester. The city, which had rapidly expanded due to the industrial revolution, held various degrees of housing, ranging from, poverty-ridden slum housing to the new era of luxurious housing such as 84 Plymouth Road. The design is striking; the house contains twenty rooms on two floors over a concealed basement with a front porch containing four columns carved with a lotus leaf shape, reminiscent of the Tower of the Winds in Athens. Stucco features on the front facade of the house. Despite the house's facade having a pink coat for years, earning it the nickname 'The Pink House', during the times of Elizabeth Gaskell the walls were described as a \\"stone-colour\\". The Gaskells' residence Elizabeth Gaskell, in portrait of 1851 by George RichmondElizabeth and William, along with their children, Marianne, Margaret Emily \\"Meta\\", Florence, and Julia, moved into the house (then numbered 42 Plymouth Grove) in June 1850, after the publication of Elizabeth's first novel, Mary Barton. However, they had lived in Manchester for some time previously as William Gaskell's job of assistant Minister at Cross Street Unitarian Chapel, required the family to move from Knutsford, in neighbouring Cheshire. The family had stayed at two different locations in Manchester, both of which have now been demolished. 84 Plymouth Grove's spacious accommodation concerned Gaskell, who, despite calling the house \\"a beauty\\", was concerned about residing in such an expensive house (the rent was £150 per annum) while others lived in poverty.Letter to Eliza Fox (April 1850) in Despite Elizabeth's concerns, the Gaskells were not frugal, with the twenty room house costing half of William's salary in rent. Elizabeth, feeling guilty, justified it by stating, \\"It is [William] who is to decide on all these things\\".Brill (1984), pp 81–83. Until the birth of their children they required only one servant, Betsy, however, at Plymouth Grove much more domestic staff were employed, including a cook, several maids, a handyman for outdoor work, as well as a washerwoman and a seamstress. Elizabeth trained her staff and looked after their welfare whilst they were employed at the house. Charlotte Brontë, one of the many guests who stayed at 84 Plymouth Grove on various occasionsCharlotte Brontë, who visited the house three times between 1851 and 1854, described it as \\"a large, cheerful, airy house, quite out of Manchester smoke\\". The \\"Manchester smoke\\", as Brontë described it, was generated from the hundreds of textile factories and cotton mills situated within the inner city, in particular the Ancoats area. In the 1850s there were over 100 mills in Manchester. On one occasion, the meek Brontë even hid behind the curtains in Gaskells' drawing room as she was too shy to meet the other guests. Barbara Brill, biographer of William Gaskell, stated that \\"Plymouth Grove could be likened to the activities of a beehive\\", due to the Gaskells entertaining many guests whilst living at the house. Besides Brontë, visitors to the house during Elizabeth Gaskell's lifetime included Charles Dickens, who, on one occasion in 1852, made an impromptu visit to the house, along with his wife at 10am, much to the dismay of Elizabeth, who mentioned it to be \\"far too early\\". John Ruskin, Harriet Beecher Stowe, American writer Charles Eliot Norton and conductor Charles Hallé also visited Elizabeth Gaskell at Plymouth Grove. Hallé visited the house often, teaching Meta Gaskell how to play the piano. Gaskell lived at Plymouth Grove with her family until her death 15 years later, in 1865, and all of her later books were written there, including some of her most famous works, such as Cranford and North and South. Gaskell died in Alton, Hampshire, in a house she had just secretly purchased, without informing William. She had planned to entice William into leaving Manchester and retiring there, but she collapsed suddenly in the arms of Meta, and died on 12 November 1865. Her husband, William Gaskell, a Unitarian minister and educationalist, survived Elizabeth by nearly two decades, dying in 1884 of bronchitis.Brill (1984), pp 117–118. Upon his death, his two surviving unmarried daughters, Meta and Julia, lived in the house (his two other daughters, Marianne and Florence, had both married, though Florence died 3 years prior to William's death). The two sisters continued living at Plymouth Grove and both were involved in various charitable causes throughout their lives. Julia, despite being the youngest, died before Meta, in October 1908, leaving Meta Gaskell alone at 84 Plymouth Grove.

Suggestion That Manchester Make It a Literary Museum LONDON, 28 Jan..—A suggestion made by Derwent Simpson, and supported by The Manchester Guardian, is that the home of the Gaskell family in Plymouth Grove, Manchester, should be bought by the Manchester Corporation and be made a literary museum.  left; font-family:'Times New Roman',serif; font-weight:bold; padding:0px 5px; vertical-align: bottom; font- size: large; color: gray\\"  \\" - colspan=3 center;\\" — 8 February 1914, The New York Times } In 1913 Meta Gaskell, the last of the Gaskells residing at Plymouth Grove, died, ending the family's 63 year occupancy of the villa. Meta was not, however, the last living Gaskell daughter. Marianne Gaskell, the eldest child, married, had three children and lived until 1920. Many suggested that the house become a public museum dedicated to Gaskell and her literary works, with the idea being supported by The Manchester Guardian. The New York Times stated that the conversion to a museum could be achieved at \\"small expense\\", as it could sell some of the land belonging to the house for development. Despite the suggestion, the idea was rejected by the local authority, with The Manchester Guardian quoting them as stating, \\"The house belonged to one of the ugliest periods of architecture and was of no value beyond its association with the Gaskell family.\\" Hopes of turning 84 Plymouth Grove into a museum were soon extinguished, and the house was simply left there. The University of Manchester purchased the building in 1969, converting it for use by the International Society. The university relinquished the building in 2000. The house was listed Grade II* on the National Heritage List for England in February 1952. Restoration 84 Plymouth Grove pictured in 2009, immediately before restoration work began The building was purchased in 2004 by the Manchester Historic Buildings Trust, with the aim of restoring the building and allowing it to be opened to the public. A blue commemorative plaque on the front of the house reads: \\"Elizabeth Cleghorn Gaskell (1810–1865) Novelist and authoress of Mary Barton and Cranford and many other works lived here (1850–1865)\\". In 2006, the house was in a very poor state of repair with severe structural problems, and was listed on the English Heritage Buildings at Risk Register. An article in The Independent noted the state of disrepair: \\"Structural cracks run through the walls, the foundations have to be underpinned, the whole roof replaced and dry rot eradicated, while the entire building must be restored and upgraded.\\" Restoration work began in September 2009.http://www.elizabethgaskellhouse.org The house stands within a five-minute walk of Victoria Baths, another Victorian-era landmark requiring substantial restoration. The villa was given a £750,000 restoration of its exterior and new roof was placed on the house in 2010. Lead was used at the insistence of English Heritage. However, in May 2011, metal thieves stole most of the lead from the new roof, which caused £250,000 worth of damage in the process and allowed rainwater into the house. The remaining lead was removed from the roof to deter any further thefts and a new roof constructed in its place. Work on the first phase of restoration, which fixed the roof, drains and structural damage, finished in February 2013, with most of the external work complete and the building made water-tight. During this time, the pink paint covering the house was stripped off and replaced with an off-white colour. A plaque in honour of Elizabeth Gaskell adorns the front of the house In June 2012 it was announced that a grant of £1.85 million from the Heritage Lottery Fund had been secured, allowing restoration of the house's interior to take place. The funding paid for the restoration of the bedrooms and reception rooms and created a visitor learning area. The lottery grant was also used to help restore the house's garden, where the Gaskells once kept pigs, poultry and a cow. The ground floor of the house has been fully restored in the style of an authentic Victorian home. Curators of the house researched what 84 Plymouth Grove would have looked like during the Gaskells' residence and borrowed a number of period items of furniture from the Manchester's art galleries and the John Rylands Library in order to recreate the Gaskells' study and other rooms. Heritage experts from the Whitworth Art Gallery were consulted to help find the right wallpaper and paint colours that would have been used in the house at the time. Armitage Construction, a specialist heritage firm founded in 1874, restored the decorative plasterwork and carpentry in the house using traditional lime plaster and woodworking techniques from the period. In February 2014 the renovators of the house were seeking a donation of a mid-19th century Broadwood demi grand piano—the model that Charles Hallé used to teach Elizabeth Gaskell's daughters at the house—for the drawing room of 84 Plymouth Grove. The upstairs of the house has a number of rooms and performance spaces dedicated to educational work, literary and community events. Gaskell House reopened to the public on 5 October 2014. Curators of 84 Plymouth Grove hope that literary tourism will benefit the house, and make it a destination similar Shakespeare's Birthplace in Stratford-upon-Avon or the Brontë Parsonage Museum in Haworth.

History  The German-speaking Community measures over 853 km2 (329 sq miles) in the Belgian region of Wallonia, and is made up of two territories consisting of nine municipalities. This territory roughly covers the former Prussian districts (Kantone) of Eupen, Malmedy and Sankt Vith (Saint-Vith).

As an international, McAlinden also played for both Ireland teams – the IFA XI and the FAI XI. After retiring as a player, he went on to manage Glenavon, Distillery and Drogheda United. Club career Belfast Celtic In 1934, aged 16, McAlinden was playing for Glentoran Reserves, when after a game against their reserves, he was offered a professional contract by Belfast Celtic. McAlinden, together with Jackie Vernon, Tommy Breen, Billy McMillan and Charlie Tully, subsequently became a prominent member of the Celtic team managed by Elisha Scott. This team dominated the Irish League in the era before and during the Second World War. Among his most notable contributions was scoring in the 2–1 win against Bangor in the 1938 Irish Cup final. After a spell with Portsmouth, McAlinden returned to Celtic in 1939, helping the club to further honours before leaving for Shamrock Rovers in 1945. Portsmouth In December 1938 McAlinden signed for Portsmouth for a fee of £7.500. He made his debut for the club against Chelsea and went onto became a regular in the side. Within six months of his arrival at the club, he helped them win the 1939 FA Cup Final, beating Wolves 4–1. After the outbreak of the Second World War, he played three times for Portsmouth in wartime regional leagues, but his first spell with the club ended when he then returned to Belfast Celtic. McAlinden returned to Portsmouth for a second spell in 1946. In September 1947 he left Portsmouth once again and joined Stoke City for a fee of £7,000. Shamrock Rovers Following the end of his second spell with Belfast Celtic and before he rejoined Portsmouth, McAlinden signed for Shamrock Rovers in September 1945. He made his debut against Shelbourne at Milltown on 16 September. While playing for Rovers his teammates included Paddy Coad, Peter Farrell and Tommy Eglington. During his one season with Rovers, McAlinden helped the club reach the 1946 FAI Cup final. However Rovers lost 3–1 to Drumcondra. Stoke City McAlinden joined Stoke City in September 1947 for a then club record fee of £7,000. He became regular inside forward under manager Bob McGrory in 1947–48 playing in 33 matches scoring just twice against Aston Villa and Huddersfield Town. His lack of goals saw him fall out of favour at the Victoria Ground and he was sold to Third Division South side Southend United in October 1948. Southend United In 1948 Southend United signed McAlinden from Stoke City for a fee of £8,000. He continued to play for United until 1954 and during his time with the club he served as club captain. He also became something of a cult hero among the club's fans and is remembered as being possibly the best player ever to play for the club. In 1950, McAlinden was caught up in controversy after it was alleged that he received illegal payments during his second spell with Portsmouth. As a result, he was suspended for the first two months of the 1950–51 season. In April 1954 he made his last home appearance for United in a 4–1 win over Queens Park Rangers. International career When McAlinden began his international career in 1937 there were in effect, two Ireland teams, chosen by two rival associations. Both associations, the Northern Ireland – based IFA and the Irish Free State – based FAI claimed jurisdiction over the whole of Ireland and selected players from the whole island. As a result, several notable Irish players from this era, including McAlinden played for both teams. IFA XI Between 1937 and 1948, McAlinden made 5 appearances for the IFA XI, making his international debut in a 1–1 draw with Scotland at Pittodrie Stadium on 10 November 1937. His IFA XI appearances also include the 8–4 defeat against a Combined Services XI at Windsor Park on 9 September 1944. This team was basically a Great Britain XI and featured, among others, Matt Busby, Stanley Matthews, Tommy Lawton and Stan Mortensen. He also played against England in 7–2 defeat at Windsor Park on 9 September 1946. He made his last appearance for the IFA XI on 10 October 1948 in a 6–2 defeat to England at Windsor Park. McAlinden made his first three appearances for the IFA XI while with Belfast Celtic, his fourth while at Portsmouth and his fifth while at Southend United FAI XI In 1946, while with Portsmouth, McAlinden also made 2 appearances for the FAI XI. He was one of several players born in Northern Ireland who benefited from the FAI's attempts to establish their all-Ireland influence. In June 1946 when the FAI organised an Iberian tour, McAlinden, together with Jackie Vernon, Billy McMillan and Paddy Sloan, was one of four Northern Irish players called up. McAlinden subsequently played in both the 3–1 defeat to Portugal on 16 June and then helped Ireland gain a surprise 1–0 victory against Spain on 23 June 1946. Coaching career In 1955 McAlinden became player/manager of Glenavon. He continued playing for a further year before finally retiring as a player to concentrate on management. During a thirteen- year spell with Glenavon he guided them two Irish League titles, three Irish Cup victories and one Gold Cup. After leaving Glenavon, McAlinden worked as a full-time scout for Coventry City before taking charge at Distillery in 1969.

The works and inventions of this child prodigy belong to the areas of electronics, magnetism, acoustics, transmission of sound signals, and transformers. Marcel was born in Križevci as a descendant of the noble family Kiepach, which came to Križevci in the early 19th century and became influential in the town. He studied economics in Berlin and electrical engineering in Charlottenburg. In Berlin on March 16, 1910, as a boy of sixteen, Marcel patented a maritime compass that indicates north regardless of the presence of iron or magnetic forces. He patented an improved version in London on December 20, 1911. This second version was a remote maritime compass device, consisting of ampermeters as the indicating instruments located in different parts of the ship, resistant to magnetic forces or magnetic masses in their vicinity. In France, he patented a dynamo for vehicle lighting. It was an electric generator combined with the mechanical drive of the vehicle itself. His \\"small transformer\\" for low voltage was widely implemented according to the \\"Kiepach-Weiland System\\". He also patented a power switch. He was active in various other areas of mechanics and electronics. He held correspondence with famous world scientists and inventors. When World War I broke out, Kiepach volunteered. He died at the Russian front when he was 21. His remains were brought to Križevci in 1917, where they were laid in the family tomb in the Town Cemetery. His two patents were included in the big exhibition Centuries of Natural Science in Croatia: Theory and Application (June–October 1996, Klovićevi Dvori Gallery). Prof. Vladimir Muljević lectured about his work at the 4th international symposium on new technologies 1993. Today, Križevci have the Marcel Kiepach Innovation Society. The town museum keeps many of his documents and family photographs. In 2004, Križevci held an exhibition about the Kiepach family.

She attended an International School in Mougins and finished her GCSEs in the summer of 2004. Having finished school and exams for the summer, she sang jazz to friends and family. At age 15, while living with her parents in France, she was heard singing at a party in a vineyard by producer Geoff Gurd, who was so impressed he took her under his wing and began recording her.[ Billboard Discography] Shortly afterward Hart recorded for the first time at Gurd's recording studio. Gurd has written several songs specifically for Hart. Hart, Gurd and Lynne Pearson formed a team of singer, writer/producer and manager who, together with a promotional team, developed Hart's debut album released in June 2007. In May 2006 she performed at the Cannes Film Festival, Alex Proud heard Hart perform at the Pangea Club and later invited her to sing at the opening night of his new bar and gallery in London, At Proud. The audience included journalists and club owners and from this she was asked to perform at The Pigalle Club, in Piccadilly in London. Hart supported the Blue Harlem group. In 2007, while working as a singing waitress at the Naked Turtle restaurant in London, the 18-year-old Hart was invited to perform for a benefit party during the Cannes Film Festival hosted by George Clooney and other stars, including Brad Pitt. The story was a press sensation and not soon after Hart had signed a purportedly $1m contract with Decca Records. This led to the \\"singing waitress\\" nickname. Her debut album Whatever Happened to Romance was released on 30 June 2007 and peaked at the number 22 position on the Billboard Top Jazz Album list. On 27 October 2008 she released The Lost Gershwin, an album of lesser-known songs by George Gershwin.

The majority of Austrian hip hop acts does Underground hip hop, as the big radio stations in Austria have no airtime for native hip hop. The only radio station that does so is FM4, which focuses on alternative music. History and Acts Falco is often being seen as the first successful Austrian rapper, but in fact Falco didn't want to be seen as rapper, but as a pop/rock musician. Nevertheless, the first songs from Austria to be known of featuring rap verses were sung by Falco. The first \\"official\\" Austrian hip hop album to be released was Sound Vibes by The Moreaus in 1990. Then again, The Moreaus were not very defining for hip hop in Austria. The most well-known acts in the 1990s were Schönheitsfehler, Fünfhaus Posse and Texta. From the beginning, the hip hop culture in Austria was being dominated by East Austrian acts. There have been only a few acts from the west of Austria who got wider attention. In 2000, Schönheitsfehler had their first commercial success. Their album SexDrugsAndHipHop reached rank 20 of the Austrian Longplay Charts, with the single Fuck You charting in Germany. With the rise of Gangsta rap in Germany in the middle of the 2000s, more and more Gangsta rappers in Austria appeared. Most notable are Chakuza, Nazar and Raf Camora who also had commercial success. Chakuza and Raf later moved on to changing their sound, leaving Gangsta rap behind. In 2008, the Viennese rap group Die Vamummtn got famous over YouTube. Their amateur video Krocha Hymne in which they are referring to the youth culture \\"Krocha\\" currently has over 1 million views. The song was released by Universal Music Austria only a few months after the hype and was the first hip hop single to reach the Charts since over five years. Only two years later, other YouTube hypes lead to a success – the song Kabinenparty by Skero, a member of Texta, reached rank 4 of the Austrian Single Charts after having become a viral video on the internet. The hip hop duo Trackshittaz succeeded in reaching rank 1 of the Single Charts with their song Oida Taunz, also shortly after having a video going viral. This was the first time that an Austrian hip hop act reached rank one of the Charts. The probably most successful female hip hop artist is Mieze Medusa, who also organizes the monthly poetry slam textstrom. Dialect Many Austrian hip hop artists use their mothertongue Austro-Bavarian dialects when rapping – while some do so to stay \\"real\\", others deliberately distinguish themselves from the German rap scene by doing so. For example, Fünfhaus Posse's first album was recorded in Viennese German, while standard Austrian German was used for their later ones (due to commercial reasons). Dialect is notably often used when being ironic, while most rappers use standard German for serious texts – in the mid-2000s this led to dialect having an image of non-seriousness. Gangsta Rap artists made fun of dialect acts and were orientated towards the big German hip hop scene. This has changed in the last few years with the success of Slangsta acts (a Portmanteau of slang and gangsta) who combine serious texts with dialect, the most notably artist being Ansa.

It was a departure for MacLean in that, despite the thriller novel plot, the setting is essentially that of a western novel, set in the western ranges of the Sierra Nevada mountains of the Rocky Mountains in the Western United States in the late 19th century. Fans of MacLean will recognize the usual plots twists, thrill-packed finale, and trademark sardonic dialogue. Unfortunately, for American audiences, MacLean was less successful capturing an authentic tone of the frontier American West, and the 1975 movie version starring Charles Bronson, Richard Crenna, Ben Johnson, and Jill Ireland, proved to be more popular with the public than the novel.Library of Congress record of Breakheart Pass Plot introduction The story begins with a perilous winter railroad journey through the Sierra Nevada mountain chain in the 1870s in the midst of a blizzard. Aboard the train are Nevada state governor Fairchild and his niece Marica, along with U.S. Army cavalry Colonel Claremont and two carloads of troops. Joining them are U.S. Marshal Pearce, the governor's aide, and Pearce's old Army buddy Major O'Brien. Pearce, a lawman and Indian agent is transporting supposedly dangerous murderer and gunman John Deakin. Their destination is the remote Fort Humboldt deep in the Nevada mountains, whose troops have recently been decimated by a cholera epidemic. (This Fort Humboldt is fictional and has no connection with the Fort Humboldt State National Park in California.) Dr. Molyneaux, a tropical disease expert, is also accompanying the group. As the journey continues we slowly learn that all is not what it seems, and that none of the characters is telling the whole truth. MacLean meticulously obliterates the lines defining exactly which characters are the good guys and which are the bad. As the story winds down, the cunningly devious nature of the plan is finally revealed. Background Producer Elliot Kastner says he gave MacLean an office at 20th Century Fox to write the novel as therapy, as he says MacLean was suffering in his marriage and with alcoholism.

Edwin John James QC (c.1812 – 4 March 1882) was an English lawyer who also practised in the U.S., a Member of Parliament and would-be actor. Disbarred in England and Wales for professional misconduct, he ended his life in poverty. He was the first ever Queen's Counsel to suffer disbarment. Early career His parents were John James, a solicitor and secondary of the City of London, and his wife Caroline née Combe, niece of Harvey Christian Combe.The Times, 7 March 1882, p.10 col.D He unsuccessfully attempted to establish a career as an actor at an early age, taking lessons from John Cooper. He played at a private theatre in Gough Street, Gray's Inn Road, London and appeared as George Barnwell in The London Merchant at Cooper's Theatre Royal, Bath.Boase (2004), \\"James, Edwin John (1812–1882)]\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography But, he lacked the natural good looks to succeed in the theatre, being said by Cyrus Jay to have \\"the appearance of a prize fighter\\". He turned to the law to become a barrister, being called to the bar by the Inner Temple in 1836.Knott (1912) p.317 James practised on the Home circuit and his most famous cases included: *The successful prosecution of poisoner William Palmer in 1856. *The successful defence of Dr Simon Bernard, who was tried in 1858 for complicity with Felice Orsini in his plot to assassinate Napoleon III of France. James aroused controversy with his defence that Bernard had intended to kill a person other than Napoleon III.Pue (1990) 83 John Simon was James's junior at the trial.R v. Bernard [1858] 8 St. Tr. N.S. 887, (1858) 1 F&F; 240 *The Canadian appeal case of the fugitive slave John Anderson.Boase [1891] James was made QC in 1850 but was not elected a bencher of the Inner Temple as was customary. This may have been because of the Establishment's distaste for his radical sympathies and the nature of his practice.Pue (1990) 82–83 The Spectator described him as: James was appointed Recorder of Brighton in 1855, by that time enjoying an income of £7,000 per year (£477,000 at 2003 prices). In 1859 he was elected Liberal MP for Marylebone.Stenton (1976) Scandal Mr Edwin James QC in Garibaldi's Camp - From a sketch by our special artist, Illustrated London News, October 13, 1860 As an MP, he was a loyal supporter of Palmerston and favoured the introduction of a ballot for parliamentary elections and the abolition of church taxes to support the state church. His radicalism went beyond the mainstream. He spoke in public in support of democracy and against Napoleon III, and spent part of 1859 at the camp of Giuseppe Garibaldi. His reputation suffered by his alleged bribery of voters in his campaign on behalf of John Jervis in the Horsham constituency in 1847. Early in 1861, James was reputedly on the point of being appointed Attorney GeneralThe Times, 18 March 1882, p.10 col.D has \\"Solicitor General\\" but \\"Attorney General\\" is clear from Pue (1990) but on 9 April 1861, he suddenly resigned all his public offices, stating that he needed to devote his time to his professional career.Pue (1990) 76 It came to light that he was in dire financial difficulties, owing £100,000 (£7.5 million at 2003 prices) and under investigation by his Inn. It was established that he had: * Led Lord Worsley, the young son of Lord Yarborough, into debts of £35,000 (£2.6 million at 2003 prices) in 1857 and 1860; * Obtained £20,000 (£1.6 million at 2003 prices) from Mr Fryar, a solicitor and his election advisor, by misrepresentation in 1853; and * Borrowed £1,250 (£94,000 at 2003 prices) from a witness he was to cross-examine in return for a promise of light questioning. Yarborough apparently persuaded James to resign his public offices in order to protect Worsley. Marriage and family On 9 July 1861 James married Marianne née Hilliard. They divorced in 1863, after having emigrated to the United States. James became a naturalized United States citizen in 1866. In 1868 he married Eliza née Wilson (1825–1902). She had formerly been married to Joachim Hayward Stocqueler.Boase rev. Metcalfe (2004) Disbarment and after Disbarred on 18 June 1861, James soon emigrated to the U.S. and was admitted to the bar in New York. There he was lauded as a leader of the English Bar, and he commented publicly on matters of public controversy, such as the Trent Affair. The British press suggested that the New York Bar were well aware of his disbarment in England.Pue (1990) pp 77–78 When James' earlier conduct did become known in America, an attempt was made to disbar him there; it failed when he denied the charges on oath and the judges were equally divided as to his culpability. He appeared to have resurrected his acting career, performing at the Winter Garden Theatre, New York in 1865. He became an associate editor of the New York Clipper, a sporting and entertainment newspaper. He also worked as the publicity manager for Adah Menken, the actress known for her sensational performance in Mazeppa. He kept up a long correspondence with her until her death in Paris. He took American citizenship in 1866. After returning to England in 1873, James failed to gain readmission to the bar of England and Wales. He also failed to be admitted as a solicitor or to be selected for Marylebone. He practised as a paralegal for the rest of his life but was in poor financial circumstances, and eventually relied on charity.

The origin of the Nag's Head Fable has been traced to him. Roman Catholic and Irish Matthew Parker, whose consecration Holywood claimed was invalid. His family, which draws its name from Holywood, a village near Dublin, had long been distinguished both in Church and State. Christopher Holywood studied at Padua, entered the Society of Jesus at Dôle in 1579, was afterwards professor of Scripture and theology at Pont-a-Mousson, Ferrara, and Padua, and there met St Robert Bellarmine. In 1598 he was sent to Ireland, but was arrested on his way and confined in the Gatehouse Prison, the Tower of London and Wisbech Castle, and was eventually shipped to the continent after the death of Queen Elizabeth. He then resumed his interrupted journey and reached Ireland on St. Patrick's Eve, 1604. This same year he published two Latin works attacking the Church of England. One of which included the first allegation of an indecent consecration of archbishop of Canterbury Matthew Parker. This became known as the Nag's Head Fable and the story was not discredited in the eyes of some Roman Catholics for centuries. He was soon appointed superior of the Jesuits in Ireland. Ireland under King James I On the accession of King James I, there had been a reaction in favor of Catholicism, and if this was strong even in England, it was far stronger in Ireland, leading in some cases to the Jesuit occupation of the Church of Ireland properties. Father Holywood and his fellow Jesuits had their hands full of work. Though there were only four Jesuits in Ireland when he landed, their number rapidly increased, and there were forty-two when he died, besides sixty others in training or occupied in teaching on the continent. After the imposition of the Oath of Allegiance there followed a persecution. By the enforced education of their children as Anglicans, many noble and influential families converted, and the lands of Roman Catholics were freely given to settlers from England. Holywood continued to do his work. At Kilkenny, for instance, a school which lasted until Oliver Cromwell's time was begun in 1619. Five \\"residences\\", or bases for Jesuit Fathers, were established, from where missionaries were sent out. Holywood's last report is for the year 1624. He died on 4 September 1626.

History Crossroads opened on February 17, 1974 with anchor stores John A. Brown, Dillard's, Montgomery Ward, and JCPenney. The name Crossroads Mall was chosen because it lies at the major intersection of I-35 and I-240, a major crossroads of the city. At the time of its opening, it was one of the largest construction projects to have ever taken place in the state of Oklahoma, and also was among the ten largest shopping malls in the United States. A 1974 a Daily Oklahoman newspaper article heralded the shopping mall as \\"the most magnificent enclosed and air-conditioned shopping mall in the Southwest.\\" Before the mall's closure, the mall contained approximately 36 stores and services. It also has a very large trade zone outside of the mall building itself with numerous retailers, and restaurants, including two hotels and a movie theater. Crossroads Mall had been one of the more popular shopping establishments in the city for well over twenty years. It is noted as one of the primary reasons for the suburban flight of retail shoppes from Downtown Oklahoma City, which is now beginning to show an increase of retail shops following the Metropolitan Area Projects Plan. Decline In 2001 Montgomery Ward closed its doors due to bankruptcy. Even with its popularity, in its over 30-year history Crossroads lacks any substantial renovations or retail growth. The expansion of shopping centers in Moore and along I-240 west of the mall has also contributed to a dramatic decline in the number of shoppers. Crossroads Mall is situated in an area of increased gang activity, leading to an increase in crime and safety issues. Teen loitering had increasingly become a problem to the point that on October 26, 2006, the mall imposed a weekend curfew prohibiting teens younger than 18 years of age from shopping after 6 PM on Fridays and Saturdays unless they were accompanied by a parent or legal guardian. It was anticipated that by imposing the curfew, the mall would become more family friendly. Throughout the late 2000s, all four anchor stores, among with other small stores, eventually vacated the mall, as a result of the 2008 economic downturn and increased gang activity. A few years later, on October 10, 2011, YouTube user miah022 uploaded a video taking a tour of the soon-to-become dead mall, passing the vacant anchor stores Dillard's, JCPenney, Macy's and Steve & Barry's, as well as some stores and restaurants that are still opened at the time the video was uploaded. This included Eyemasters (a trade name of Visionworks), Finish Line, Inc., Journeys, Champs Sports, Victoria's Secret, Frederick's of Hollywood, Zales Jewelers, Regis, The Laughing Fish, Eastern Treasures, L'Patricia, Hat World, Claire's, Touchtell Wireless, 5-7-9, GameStop, Chinex, Hot Spot Pizza (formerly a Sbarro Pizza location), Sam's Optical, an unknown Samsung/T-Mobile US booth, Bath & Body Works and rue21. A lot of stores are relocated to Oklahoma City's other shopping malls, and this had become a serious problem, because this was probably a failed attempt to bring back everything the mall had from the start. A lot of the aforementioned stores and restaurants were closed prior to the mall's 2017 closing. The property was foreclosed upon in April 2009 and it fell under the ownership of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York due to the Bear Stearns bailout. The mall was part of a portfolio of Bear Stearns assets, including $5.5 billion in commercial loans, that the Fed used to secure $29 billion to lend to JPMorgan Chase to buy Bear Stearns. According to Price Edwards & Co.’s 2010 Oklahoma City Mid-Year Retail Market Summary report, Crossroads Mall was 75 percent vacant. On September 14, 2011, the mall was purchased by Raptor Properties, LLC for $3.5 million, far below the $24 million asking price. Although the sale only included , as several other parts of the property were previously sold to other investors.  Incidents  A young man opened fire on May 27, 2006, injuring a teen before the man was shot and killed by an off-duty sheriff's deputy. On November 26, 2008, following reports that individuals in a vehicle travelling on Interstate 240 had pulled a gun on the driver of another vehicle, a police helicopter followed the vehicle of the suspected gunmen as it drove into the mall parking lot where one suspect, or suspects, exited the vehicle and ran into the entrance of Dillard's. Police surrounded the mall's entrances and exits and were also able to surround the suspects' vehicle. Two suspects were subsequently arrested, including the alleged gunman Brandon Gunn. A third suspect was detained, but not arrested. The mall was not evacuated and there were no reports of injuries. Re-branding & future renovations In April 2013, Raptor Properties announced plans to re-brand Crossroads Mall in a similar fashion to the revitalized La Gran Plaza in Fort Worth, Texas by attracting businesses that serve the local Hispanic community. On April 24, 2013, Raptor announced that the new name of the mall would be Plaza Mayor at the Crossroads. They also announced future renovations that would have included space for a grocery store, a nightclub and a rodeo arena seating 3,500 spectators. The mall's entrances and bathrooms would have also been remodeled and the carousel moved to make way for a new stage and entertainment area, complete with $100,000 worth of new sound and lighting equipment. Before the mall closed, these plans were never fully realized. As of June 2017, Plaza Mayor's website is occupied only by a banner telling visitors the site has been suspended, and directing the \\"customer\\" to check their email, possibly indicating another abandonment of work in the area. On September 29, 2017, CRM Properties announced that they had abandoned plans to rehabilitate the mall, and would close it permanently on 31 October 2017 as an order to build a couple of schools there.

He was a member of parliament (MP) from 1945 to 1950 and principal of Ruskin College from 1950 to 1979.  Career  His father Arthur was a secondary school teacher, and mother Maggie was a former elementary school headteacher who educated him at home until age eleven. Hughes had been born in Swindon, but moved with his parents to Bakewell, Derbyshire when he was six, where he attended Bakewell grammar school before becoming a boarder at Manchester Warehousemen's and Clerks' Orphans School at Cheadle Hulme, Cheshire. He won a scholarship to Balliol College, Oxford, where he graduated in 1935 with a degree in modern history, having been chair of the Oxford University Labour Club. He started training as a schoolteacher at Manchester University, but left to work in London for the New Fabian Research Bureau (NFRB), which merged in 1938 with the Fabian Society, of which he became secretary. He was elected as a councillor on Lambeth borough council, and in 1937 he married (Winifred) Beryl Parker (died 1995), sister of Romford MP John Parker; they had no children. During World War II he served with the Royal Artillery, and at the 1945 general election he was as Member of Parliament for Wolverhampton West, holding the seat until the constituency was abolished in 1950. At the 1950 general election, he stood in the new Wolverhampton South West constituency, but was defeated by the Conservative Party candidate Enoch Powell.United Kingdom general election results, 1950, at Richard Kimber's Political Science Resources In the House of Commons, he spoke in 1945 about his fears of a nuclear arms race.Hansard, 9 July 2001, Column 579 : maiden speech of Rob Marris MP He was parliamentary private secretary (PPS) to the Secretary of State for Education, Ellen Wilkinson, whose secretary from 1937 to 1941 had been his wife Beryl. After Wilkinson's death in 1947, he continued for a year as PPS to her successor George Tomlinson, before becoming PPS to War Office minister Michael Stewart.  Ruskin College  Later that year, he was appointed as principal of Ruskin College, Oxford, an independent institution founded in 1899 to provide university standard education for working class adults with few or no qualifications so that they could act more effectively on behalf of working class communities and organisations, such as trade unions, political parties, co-operative societies and working men's institutes.What is Ruskin College? , on the Ruskin College website As principal of Ruskin until his retirement in 1979, he presided over an expansion of the college's facilities and student numbers, and securing increased funding and eventually persuading the government to make it mandatory (rather than discretionary) for Local Education Authorities to provide grants to the college's students. It was while laying the foundation stone of the college's Steve Biko building in October 1976 that the prime minister, James Callaghan, launched what became known as a \\"great debate\\" on educational standards. Callaghan questioned \\"the new informal methods of teaching which seem to produce excellent results when they are in well- qualified hands but are much more dubious when they are not\\". Hughes involvement in adult education extended beyond Ruskin and continued into his retirement. He was president of the Workers' Educational Association, served on the Russell committee on adult education (1969–73), chaired the Adult Literacy Resource Agency, and also served on the advisory council for adult and continuing education, the National Institute of Adult and Continuing Education, and the Civil Service Arbitration Tribunal. He survived his wife by four months, and died at his home in Merton, Bicester, on 15 November 1995 aged 81.

Originally published in 1969 with a cover by Norman Weaver, it is set in the late 1960s narcotics underworld of Amsterdam and other locations in the Netherlands. Plot introduction Paul Sherman is a veteran Interpol Narcotics Bureau agent, used to independent action and blunt force tactics. He is assisted by two attractive female agents, one an experienced operative, the other a rookie. Sherman is in the Netherlands after receiving word about a vicious heroin smuggling ring from a friend. However, the narco-criminals will kill ruthlessly to protect its operation and even before Sherman can leave Schiphol Airport he has already witnessed the gunning down of his key contact, been knocked half-unconscious by an assassin, and tangled with local authorities. \\"Puppet on a Chain\\" has the standard twisting plot, local atmospherics, and sardonic dialogue that were Maclean's trademarks as a story-teller. Maclean allows his protagonist to have a bantering sarcastic relationship with his assistants that provides a streak of humor as the plot unfolds. Unfortunately, Sherman's relationship with his assistants is used against him. As his investigation is undermined by betrayal, leaving him constantly a half-step behind his adversaries, Sherman must resort to increasingly violent action to turn the tables. The story culminates in a violent struggle above the streets of Amsterdam to save the life of his surviving female operative, not knowing whether anyone they meet can really be trusted. Reception The New York Times called the book \\"one of the best in the Greene-Ambler-MacInnes tradition... the writing is as crisp as a sunny winter morning\\". The book became a best seller. Background MacLean got the idea for the book from visiting Amsterdam with then business partner Geoffrey Reve who later directed the film version. Film adaptation Puppet on a Chain later appeared in film as a 1972 movie directed by Geoffrey Reeve. The 1976 super hit Bollywood movie Charas (literally Narcotics in Hindi), starring Dharmendra and Hema Malini was also an adaptation of this story.

The \\"Federació de Pilota Valenciana\\" was founded on 1984, until then it was part of the \\"Confederación Española de Pelota\\", which was devoted to Basque pelota, a different handball. Its worry about the Valencian pilota was shown when the presidents of the Valencian federation were chosen at Madrid and they were unaware of this sport or whose only merit was being retired players of the Basque variety. This was the situation until a retired professional Valencian pilotari, Enrique Menéndez, got to be president but soon gave up protesting for the \\"ignorance\\" the local handball was suffering, according to him. His resignation, so, forced the raise of an independent Valencian pilota federation.

It originally appeared as a serial in the Golden Penny. The titular Grand Babylon was modelled on the Savoy Hotel which Bennett had much later also used as a model for his 1930 novel Imperial Palace. In Bennett's journal entry on 18 January 1901, he also notes that said his serial was being advertised was the \\"best thing of this sort\\" they'd seen since The Mystery of a Hansom Cab by Fergus Hume. Plot introduction The protagonists are an American millionaire, Theodore Racksole, and his daughter Nella (Helen). While staying at the supremely exclusive Grand Babylon Hotel, Nella asks for a steak and Bass beer for dinner, but the order is refused. To get her what she wants Racksole buys the entire hotel, for £400,000 \\"and a guinea\\" (so the previous owner, Félix Babylon, can say that he haggled with the multi-millionaire businessman). Strange things are happening in the hotel. First, Racksole notices the headwaiter, Jules, winking at his daughter's friend, Reginald Dimmock, while they consume their expensive steak. He dismisses the headwaiter. The next day Miss Spencer, the pretty, efficient hotel clerk who has been employed there for years, disappears. It appears that she just took her things and left, no one knows when or where. And Prince Eugen, a prince regnant of Posen, who was to come to the hotel and meet his youthful uncle Prince Aribert (he and the nephew are of the same age), never turns up. Then the body of Dimmock, who was an equerry to the princes, come ahead to prepare for their visit, is found. He was obviously poisoned. And soon after, Dimmock's body disappears. The same evening the hotel is having a ball in the Gold Room, hosted by a Mr and Mrs Sampson Levi. There is a special secret window though which one can observe the room and the guests. Racksole looks out of it and sees among the guests the dismissed headwaiter, Jules. Racksole runs out to confront him and throw him out, but can't find him. He comes back to the secret window to find Jules, staring intensely into the ball room. Racksole orders him out of the hotel for the second time. Prince Aribert, who met Nella in Paris while he was travelling incognito under the name of Count Steenbock, confides the whole story to her. He tells her that Prince Eugen never arrived, and no one knows where he is. He was last seen at Ostend. His Majesty the Emperor sent a telegram to Aribert, requesting the whereabouts of Eugen. Aribert, who does not know whether there might be a secret love affair, or an abduction, is facing a dilemma. At last he decides to go to Berlin and state the facts to the Emperor. Nella promises him help and support in London. After the departure of Aribert, an old lady signs into the hotel under the name of 'Baroness Zerlinski'. Some chance remarks about hotel rooms convinced Nella, who was substituting for the hotel clerk, that it was, in fact Miss Spencer in disguise. When she finds out that Miss Spencer suddenly checks out and departs for Ostend, Nella too goes to Ostend, leaving a short message for her father as to her whereabouts. In Ostend, Nella follows Miss Spencer into a house, and tries to find out what's going on, threatening the latter with a revolver. Miss Spencer says that she was under orders of Jules, the headwaiter, whose real name is Tom Jackson and who is, she claims, her husband. She says that Jackson/Jules quarrelled with Dimmock and that he had some \\"money business\\" with Prince Eugen. She admits that the Prince was a captive in that same house, and she looked after him. He was abducted to prevent him arriving to London, for it would have \\"upset the scheme\\". Then Miss Spencer fakes a faint, and Nella, who comes nearer to see if she can help her, is overpowered. Nella loses consciousness.

A folly of a historical European castle, construction began in the 1920s by Boy Scout troop leader, World War I veteran, and medievalist Harry D. Andrews. He built the castle on promotional plots of land that were obtained by paying for one-year subscriptions to The Cincinnati Enquirer. Andrews named his castle after a military hospital in the Chateau La Roche in southwest France where he was stationed during the First World War. Its name means \\"Rock Castle\\" in French. For over fifty years, Andrews worked on his castle project. He pulled stones from the nearby Little Miami River, and when that supply was exhausted, molded bricks with cement and quart milk cartons. When Andrews died in 1981, he willed the castle to his Boy Scout troop the Knights of the Golden Trail (KOGT). The Castle has been extensively upgraded and renovated in the years since Andrews' death and has been mostly completed by the KOGT. The East tower now houses a short video presentation on Andrews' quest to finish his dream. The walls of the upstairs chapel feature many stones brought back by Andrews in his world travels and others sent to him from foreign locations by his friends and followers. Recently completed are an expansion to the outside gardens and a greenhouse. Tales of the castle being haunted - often coming from Chateau Laroche's own volunteer knights - have been reported over the years.

It is a member of the Fair Youth sequence, in which the poet expresses his love towards a young man. The three other internal sequences include the procreation sonnets (1–17), the Rival Poet sequence (78–86) and the Dark Lady sequence (127–154). While the exact date of composition of Sonnet 101 is unknown, scholars generally agree that the group of Sonnets 61–103 was written mainly in the first half of the 1590s and was not revised before being published with the complete sequence of sonnets in the 1609 Quarto. Synopsis The Muse is chided for her absence and neglect of praise for the youth. The poet-speaker goes further, imagining the Muse responding that truth and beauty need no additions or explanations. The Muse is implored by the poet to praise the youth. The poet will teach her how to immortalize the youth's beauty. Structure Sonnet 101 is an English or Shakespearean sonnet. The English sonnet has three quatrains, followed by a final rhyming couplet. It follows the typical rhyme scheme of the form ABAB CDCD EFEF GG and is composed in iambic pentameter, a type of poetic metre based on five pairs of metrically weak/strong syllabic positions. The 11th line exemplifies a regular iambic pentameter: × / × / × / × / × / To make him much outlive a gilded tomb (101.11) :/ = ictus, a metrically strong syllabic position. × = nonictus. The 7th line has a common metrical variation, an initial reversal: / × × / × / × / × / Beauty no pencil, beauty's truth to lay; (101.7) Initial reversals are potentially present in lines 6 and 12, and a mid-line reversal (\\"what shall\\") is potentially present in line 1. The parallelism of \\"seem\\" and \\"shows\\" in the final line suggest a rightward movement of the fourth ictus (resulting in a four-position figure, \`× × / /\`, sometimes referred to as a minor ionic): × / × / × / × × / / To make him seem, long hence, as he shows now. (101.14) While Petrarchan sonnets by tradition have a volta at the end of line eight, in Shakespeare's sonnets this can occur as late as line 12 and sometimes not at all. In Sonnet 101, a volta seems to occur at the end of line eight, as the poet-speaker, in a role-reversal with the Muse, begins to actively lead the Muse towards the couplet and there provides the Muse with a solution to the problem of \\"what to say and how to say it\\" thus ensuring that memory of youth will endure.  Context   Within the sonnet sequence  In addition to Sonnet 100, Sonnet 101 is recognized as one of the only two sonnets in the complete sequence which directly invokes the Muse. These two sonnets in turn are part of the group of four sonnets, 100–103, wherein the poet-speaker deflects blame for his silence from himself onto the Muse, making excuses for having not written or if writing, not writing adequately. Dubrow notes the use here of occupatio, that rhetorical method of announcing a topic which one will not discuss and by that announcement already commencing a discussion of it. On the other hand, Stirling has noted the differences of 100–101 from 102–103 and from the larger group 97–104, and that by removing them, one creates a more cohesive sequence (97–99, 102–104) tied together by \\"the theme of absence and 'return'\\". A new position for 100–101 is suggested as the introduction to a sequence (100–101, 63–68, 19, 21, 105) which develops with its \\"twin ideas of Time the destroyer—Verse the preserver.\\" As mentioned above, the large group 61–103 was probably written mainly in the first half of the 1590s, and presented unrevised in 1609. Together with two other groups, 1–60 (\\"... written mainly in the first half of the 1590s; revised or added to after 1600, perhaps as late as 1608 or 1609\\") and 104-26 (\\"... written around or shortly after 1600\\") they make up the largest subsection known as the Fair Youth Sonnets (1-126). The other three internal sequences of note are the Procreation sequence (1-17), the Rival Poet sequence (78-86) and the Dark Lady sequence (127-154).  Within Elizabethan literary society  The two most likely candidates for the Fair Youth are Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton, an early patron of Shakespeare, and William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke, a later patron. Duncan-Jones argues that Pembroke is the more likely candidate. She also suggests that John Davies of Hereford, Samuel Daniel, George Chapman, and Ben Jonson are all plausible candidates for the role of Rival Poet in Sonnets 78–86. Atkins argues that pursuing a biographical context to the poems in Shakespeare's sequence is nonsensical and that a more productive focus of attention might be on the literary society of the time—which may have included small literary associations or academies, and for one of these, the sonnets perhaps were composed. The popular themes would have included the Renaissance philosophy of platonic ideas of Truth and Beauty and Love and the relationship of each to the others.  Within Elizabethan national culture and society  In Shakespeare's time, the word 'pencil,' means paintbrush, though it can also mean style, or level of skill in painting, or \\"an agent or medium which brushes, delineates, or colors.\\"(OED 1) Dundas describes the fascination of the English Renaissance poets with painting. Sonnet 24 uses the painter and painting as the extended conceit, pointing out the limits of the painter to capture the accurate image of beauty, and even then that the visual image may show no knowledge of the inward beauty of the heart. Sonnet 101 builds on that philosophy, that neither the painter nor the poet can ever accurately reflect the truth of the loved one's beauty so why not remain silent. Martz extends the discussion by suggesting that the work of Sidney and Shakespeare is analogous to the transition from High Renaissance to Mannerist styles in that they may refer to the ideals of harmonious composition, but focus on the tensions, instabilities and anxieties and (in Shakespeare) darker moods in the images of the subjects depicted in their art. If, however \\"dyed\\" (defined as to tinge with color, (OED 1) as of textiles and clothing) as the key metaphor, then the concepts, values and motivations behind the English sumptuary laws become of plausible relevance. Indeed, a more direct reference to the dyer's profession is given in Sonnet 111, \\"And almost thence my nature is subdued / to what it works in, like the dyer's hand[.]\\" Here in Sonnet 101 as in others in the sequence Shakespeare can be seen as making reference to the \\"anxiety about the emulation of betters\\" that drove the regulation of apparel and its coloring.  Exegesis   Quatrain 1  In the preceding Sonnet 100, the poet literally asks, \\"Where art thou, Muse, that thou forget'st so long / to speak of that which gives thee all thy might?\\" (Sonnet 100, 1-2), and then implores, \\"Return, forgetful Muse, and straight redeem\\" (Sonnet 100, 5) itself/the poet, by inspiring him his pen with \\"both skill and argument,\\" (Sonnet 100, 8). By Sonnet 101, however, the poet has taken a very different tone with the Muse, and no longer simply begs or implores for inspiration, but rather asks \\"Oh truant Muse what shall be thy amends / for thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed?\\" (Sonnet 101,1-2). The poet has gone from speaking as passively inspired to demanding amends from the Muse for its neglect of he and his Fair Youth. The poet then implicates the Muse in his own plight, by declaring, \\"Both truth and beauty on my love depends; / so dost thou too, and therein dignified\\" (101, 3-4), meaning that both the poet and the Muse are given purpose by their function in praising truth and beauty.  Quatrain 2  As mentioned above, rather than asking for inspiration, the poet demands explanation, though now he presumes his Muse's excuse for the neglect, which the poet takes to be that truth of beauty is self-evident, and needs no further embellishment. It is in the second and third line of this quatrain, or the sixth and seventh lines in the sonnet, where the rhythmic structure of Sonnet 101 becomes noteworthy. Whereas the rest of Sonnet 101 follows conventional structural patterns, it is in line 6 and 7, \\"Truth needs no colour with his colour fixed; / Beauty no pencil, beauty's truth to lay,\\" that the rhythm deviates from the established norm, which is discussed in depth earlier in this article. Though there is no definitive explanation for this alteration, its inconsistency warrants speculation. If we assume that the difference in pattern is not an oversight on the part of Shakespeare, then it is conceivable that this creative idiosyncrasy was made for aesthetic or symbolic reasons. It is then pertinent to question why these particular lines are given this unique structural treatment. Putting aside aesthetic interpretation, it could be conceived that Shakespeare intentionally chose these two lines with which to assert freedom from the regular metrics of iambic pentameter, to show that truth and beauty should be singled out. Given this interpretation of the second and third lines of the quatrain, the fourth line, \\"But best is best, if never intermixed?\\" can even be read as the poet-speaker's assessment that his Muse does not see fit to embellish truth and beauty through poetic inspiration.  Quatrain 3  The poet rejects this neglect of praise that he has attributed to his Muse's will, and rationalizes that it is this very praise which will immortalize the Fair Youth, \\"to make him much outlive a gilded tomb / and to be praised of ages yet to be\\" (Sonnet 101, 11-12). The contextual use of the phrase \\"gilded tomb\\" potentially refers to two different concepts, one being the meaningless decadence of expensive burial chambers, and the other being a tome as in a large volume of literature. As T. Walker Herbert notes, \\"tomb and tome could be spelled tombe in the seventeenth century.\\" \\"Granted that the external evidence is permissive rather than conclusive, let it be supposed to Shakespeare's ear that tome and tomb were sounded enough alike for purposes of a pun.\\" (Herbert, 236, 239) A third concept is suggested by William Empson (p. 138) interpreting \\"tombe\\" so that \\"tomb is formal praise as would be written on a tombstone, whereas real merits of a man are closely connected with his faults.\\" In other words, the poet-speaker is telling the muse he has the power to save his reputation when his social enemies might be writing the elegy or epitaph for his popularity, or possibly that the inner truth which is the source of his outward beauty will outlive the end of that youthful idea of beauty, or even that by the Muse singing his praise, the youth might be encouraged to sustain his lineage, even though he himself may grow old and pass on. Empson suggests that multiple ambiguous readings like this \\"must all combine to give the line its beauty and there is a sort of ambiguity in not knowing which of them to hold most clearly in mind. Clearly this is involved in all such richness and heightening of effect, and the machinations of ambiguity are among the very roots of poetry.\\"  Couplet  The poet ultimately declares to the Muses that he himself will show the Muse how to immortalize the Fair Youth. This is a significant change in attitude from the poet's previous prayers for inspiration in Sonnet 100, and even the poet's indignation at the beginning of Sonnet 101. The poet has gone from being passively inspired to a self-appointed leader of his own inspiration, which is a show of confidence that the poet does not necessarily maintain throughout the full body of sonnets.

It was produced by Robert Stabler. The narrative follows a group of explorers who, while searching for a missing man, come across the \\"Cave of the Dead\\", filled with parasitic fungi and inhabited by foamy, fungus-covered monster men. The film was released theatrically in the US in August 1957 on a double bill with Back from the Dead. Plot The mysterious disappearance of Jim Wheatley (Charles Gray) while exploring the legendary \\"Cave of the Dead\\" brings his sister Gina Matthews (Mala Powers) and her husband Dan (John Howard) to what Dan calls the \\"shores of the Caribbean.\\" But at a pre-expedition party, Gina is taken aback when Pete Morgan (Paul Richards) arrives uninvited. Pete, Gina and Dan had been a romantic triangle. Pete saved Dan's life on an earlier expedition, but was injured and now limps on his permanently damaged right leg; after the injury, Gina and Dan married. He convinces Dan to take him on the new expedition. Sir Lancelot, the King of the Calypso, performs a song with cryptic lyrics that Dan believes refer to the Cave of the Dead: Down, down, down in the bottomless cave/Down, down, down beyond the last grave/If he's got the stuff of fame/If he's worthy of his name/He may get another chance but he's never more the same/He's got to suffer to be born again. But when Dan asks Raoul Koom (Gerald Gilden), whose village is near the cave, to interpret the song, Raoul refuses, saying that it is better for both him and them if he keeps his mouth shut. Nevertheless, Dan, Gina, Pete and Raoul set off in search of the cave. Upon their arrival in Raoul's village, where the residents deny that the cave exists, Raoul runs away. Dan, Gina and Pete go to the home of \\"Americano doctor\\" Ramsey (Gerald Milton). They find him boiling fruit in a large pot and putting it up in mason jars. Ramsey is married to a villager, Concha (May Wynn), whom he treats like a servant. When she drops a jar of fruit, he beats her. Pete stops him, but Gina notices that the fruit has fungus growing on it. Ramsey tells them that he uses the fruit on his research on fungi, bacteria and slime molds. Ramsey also says there is no Cave of the Dead. Dan, Pete and Gina, however, are determined to find it, and Dan offers to pay $200 to anyone in the village who will lead them to the cave. The situation becomes tense when Concha takes Pete and Dan to a place where they can hear the voices of the dead crying from beneath the earth. While they are gone, a foamy fungus-covered man-monster chases Gina, who has stayed behind, into the jungle. She is saved when two passing men kill the creature. Lino (Duane Gray), who works for Ramsey, agrees to guide Dan and Pete to the cave entrance for the $200. While exploring the cave, Dan and Pete find several skeletons and Raoul's body. A storm floods the cave, trapping Dan. Pete escapes. After the storm abates, he and Gina return to the cave, again led by Lino. After they enter, Lino sets off a dynamite charge to trap them inside, but it also causes a rockslide which kills him. Pete and Gina discover that the cave walls are thick with a fast-growing parasitic fungus, the same stuff that grows on Ramsey's canned fruit. They find Dan, his back broken. He warns them of the fungus-covered monster-men in the cave. The man-monsters attack, but Pete fights them off with his flaming torch. The fungus begins sliding in large blobs down the sides of the cave. Pete finds a shaft that runs to Ramsey's house. Leaving Gina with Dan, he climbs up for help and learns that Ramsey himself has created the monster-making fungus. Ramsey refuses to help until Pete tells him that the fungus, which had so far been unable to live in fresh air, is now growing out of control. \\"We can't let it out!\\" exclaims Ramsey. \\"We can seal it in the cave! Otherwise it'll destroy the world!\\" Pete yanks Ramsey into the cave with him as Concha sets off explosives to collapse the shaft. The blast kills Ramsey, whose body is then consumed by his fungus. Dan dies from his injuries. Pete and Gina don the diving gear they've brought along and swim from the cave to the safety of a beautiful tropical beach.

Sir Lancelot signed to appear in the film to take advantage of the calypso craze. It was the first of an eight-picture deal between Charles Marquiss Warren's Emirau Productions and 20th Century Fox. The Unknown Terror was filmed during late March and early April 1957 at what Powers called \\"the old Producers Studio\\" in Hollywood. The film's working title was Beyond Terror, of which Powers said, \\"I think that might have been a better title.\\" According to the American Film Institute (AFI), the name and composer of the song performed by Sir Lancelot during the movie is unknown. Music for the film is listed in the credits as being by Raoul Kraushaar, but without mention of individual pieces of music.  Release  The Unknown Terror was the first film on a double-bill with Back from the Dead, both of which were made by Regal Films and were released in the US on August 12, 1957. The pressbook for the films refers to them as \\"2 Supermonstrous Superhuman Supershockers!\\" When the film was released in the UK in October 1957, it was granted an A-certificate by the British Board of Film Censors. An \\"A-Cert\\" meant that the film was considered to be \\"more suitable for adults.\\" The Unknown Terror opened in Sweden on December 1, 1957 and in Mexico and Greece at unspecified dates. Twentieth Century Fox distributed the film to theaters in the UK and the US. The film went into television syndication through National Telefilm Associates in 1960. In Chicago, for example, it was shown repeatedly after 1964, when WBBM-TV instituted \\"Science Fiction Wednesdays\\" as part of the station's Early Show daily movie series, shown at 4:00 pm Central Time, which had been on the air since the 1950s. It was also shown regularly on Chicago's WGN-TV film series Creature Features in various time slots and on various days, usually starting between 10:30 pm and 1:25 am Central Time. The movie was not available for individual home viewing until 2004, when Teakwood Studios put on sale an \\"unauthorized\\" release in VHS and DVD formats.  Critical reception  The Unknown Terror does not appear to have gotten particularly favorable reviews at the time of its release. BoxOffice in its regular feature \\"Review Digest\\" summarized the overall ratings given the film by six publications: The Hollywood Reporter and The Film Daily wrote that it was \\"good\\"; Parent's and Harrison's Reports called it \\"fair\\"; and Variety and BoxOffice both rated it as \\"poor.\\" For the magazines that placed the film in the \\"poor\\" category, \\"Kove\\", writing in Variety after having previewed the film at the studio on July 30, 1957, said it was for \\"uncritical clientele\\" and that the direction is \\"at the elementary level. The Kenneth Higgins script is distinguished only by its moldy quality.\\" BoxOffice offered readers only a brief synopsis of the plot, which noted that Gina and Pete \\"escape to bring to fruition the love they had always had for each other.\\" The magazine suggested in its \\"Exploitips\\" that exhibitors create public interest by having \\"an aid\\" from a newspaper, TV or radio station watch the film with an audience and arranging \\"with a local doctor or psychology teacher to test the person afterward for pulse rate, effects, etc.\\" BoxOffice also recommended decorating the theater lobby with \\"weird masks and Indian lore, with simulated fungus growing about.\\" The film's financial success varied by location. BoxOffice's \\"Boxoffice Barometer\\" measured gross receipts from exhibitors in 1957 in \\"20 key cities\\" using a scale on which 100 percent represented normal gross receipts. The magazine reported scores from seven of the 20 cities: Chicago, 200 percent of normal; Denver and New Haven, Connecticut, 100 percent; Detroit, 75 percent; Los Angeles, 55 percent; Pittsburgh, 45 percent; and San Francisco, 40 percent. The average score was calculated at 88 percent. Film critics have disagreed about the film's precise setting, calling it variously Mexico, Central America, South America and the Caribbean. Dialogue within the film refers to the location only as the \\"shores of the Caribbean.\\" Much of the critical commentary about The Unknown Terror has focused on the special effects; i.e., the fungus and the fungus-covered man-monsters. Most critics, both at the time of the film's release and later, agree that the fungus looks much like soap suds. Per American film critic Bill Warren, The Monthly Film Bulletin said in its 1957 review that \\"the fungus looks like gargantuan quantities of good-quality detergent.\\" Warren went on to write himself that \\"some fungi do resemble soap suds, but the reverse isn't true: soap suds do not convince as a fungal menace\\" and, as such, \\"credibility washes away in the foam.\\" Bryan Senn, the American film critic, says in a similar vein that \\"it's difficult to make a bunch of advancing soapsuds look menacing\\" and that \\"the creatures themselves are never shown too clearly, which is just as well since they inspire more menace in spongy silhouette than in full bubbly view (upon which they look just like what they are – actors with bits of dirty cotton stuck to their faces).\\" British film critic Phil Hardy writes that \\"the monsters are unintentionally hilarious – they are simply actors entirely covered in soap suds.\\" And Warren says he \\"wonders hopelessly why the filmmakers didn't consider how audiences might react when they saw huge quantities of suds pouring down cave walls. It's not likely they didn't care ... it's more likely they sadly misjudged the look of their menace, and the intelligence of most horror and science fiction audiences.\\" Two of the actors in The Unknown Terror have also commented on the special effects. Powers said in an interview that the fungus-covered monster-men's makeup \\"was just cotton, put on with a liquid adhesive or spirit gum.\\" And while Howard called the monsters \\"just nonsense\\" in an interview, he also said that \\"in viewing the movie, I thought that it looked like soap bubbles coming down the cave walls. I didn't see how this would frighten anybody, but it sure frightened the hell out of my kids – they were scared to death!\\" Other critics have dug more deeply into the film, peering through the suds to find more complex meanings. American academic film historian Rob Craig notes a religious theme within The Unknown Terror. He writes that the songs performed by Sir Lancelot \\"are well used as purveyors of taboo folk wisdom, with one line, 'He's got to suffer to be born again,' vividly foreshadowing the ensuing religious emphasis on the film.\\" As an example, Craig writes that when he's asked about the Cave of the Dead's precise location, \\"Ramsey chuckles, 'I can show you how to find that – it's their purgatory ...' as he points his spoon towards the flames under his boiling pot. A more literal reference to the fiery flames of the Christian Hell cannot be imagined and he audience now knows that what the natives fear, and the white men seek, is access to death.\\" Laurence Raw, a British film scholar, makes special note of the role of Sir Lancelot in The Unknown Terror. To Raw, Sir Lancelot's importance is that he embodies \\"mainstream Euro representations of the African American experience – on the one hand he portrays the Caribbean as a holiday-maker's paradise, full of sunshine, sea and limitless pleasures; on the other hand it is also a place of great danger, wherein westerners are perpetually vulnerable to attack by unknown forces.\\" Aspects of Sir Lancelot's career in music and film were included in a Campbell Gallery exhibit at the University of Illinois, titled \\"Calypso Music in Postwar America: Photographs and Illustrations, 1945–1990.\\" The exhibit featured \\"rare photographs and promotional graphics [which] are used to trace calypso in phonograph recordings, song publishing, nightclub acts, concerts, Broadway shows and Hollywood movies.\\" The exhibit ran from March 25 to August 10, 2008.

Originally an illegal settlement, it was founded by the Kuomintang military veterans at the end of the 1940s and served originally as an anti-aircraft position. After cooperating with non- governmental organization Global Artivists Participation Project, the Taipei City Government developed the area into an example of environmentally sustainable urban community. With the policy of preservation and revitalization, the old settlement unfolded a new vision of an artivist compound which would respect the existing fabric of the community while fulfilling the regeneration concept of \\"symbiosis\\" to incorporate production and ecology in communal living and ushering in the program of an international youth hostel and creative ideas of art to further cultural exchanges with broader international communities. Commissioned by the municipal government to propose an ecological masterplan for the area, Finnish architect Marco Casagrande found that this settlement, perhaps because of its illegal and marginal status, has evolved organically to operate according to an ecological model: recycling and filtering grey water, using minimal amounts of electricity (“stolen” from the city grid), composting organic waste, and repurposing Taipei’s waste. Casagrande relates his experiences of working on the site: For the ecological urban laboratory I had to do nothing, it was already there. What I did was to construct wooden stairways and connections between the destroyed houses and some shelters for the old residents to play mah-jong and ping-pong. Harrison, Ariane Lourie. 2013. Architectural Theories of the Environment: Posthuman Territory. New York, NY: Routledge. The community has been featured in The New York Times as one of Taiwan's must- see destinations. > Treasure Hill is the attic of Taipei carrying the memories, stories and > traditions of the past generations. In some way it is a reflection of the > Taipei mind that the industrial city is not able to reflect. For the stories > to surface the industrial city must be turned over: the city must be a > compost. —Marco Casagrande Police closed the area in 2007 in order to guarantee safety for restoration work. The restored Treasure Hill reopened as an artist village in 2010 with only 22 original families managing to move back to the settlement. The restoration process has been criticized to have caused the neighbourhood to be stripped of its prior residents and turned into a space which celebrates individual expression and artistic creativity at the expense of housing lower income families. Urban Farming The Treasure Hill community is located by the Xindian River, which was an important lifeline for the settlement providing drinking water, fish and gravel for construction work before the river got polluted. The community used to have extensive urban farms between the settlement and the river. \\"The pollution comes from the up-stream.\\" - Missis Chen, the leader of the Treasure Hill original community. Urban Acupuncture The restoration process of Treasure Hill can be viewed as an urban acupuncture, where the energy of the settlement had been turned negative and had to be redirected positively towards construction. Transportation The hill is accessible within walking distance south of Gongguan Station of Taipei Metro.

He was born in Oban, Scotland on 16 December 1972. He won the FIA GT Championship in 2000 and took a World Endurance Championship title in 2013 as an Aston Martin Racing factory driver. He now owns and runs Bullet Sports Management with business partner and former team-mate Nicolas Minassian. Family Jamie is the son of Richard & Annie Campbell-Walter. Richard Campbell-Walter is the brother of famous 50/60's model Fiona Campbell-Walter. Jamie is the grandson of Rear Admiral Keith McNeil Campbell-Walter. Early career Like many young drivers, Campbell-Walter started racing in single seaters. He made his debut in the Formula Vauxhall Junior Winter Series in 1993, taking second place in the championship, followed by a third place in the British national championship in 1994. Campbell-Walter moved to the higher Formula Vauxhall series in 1995 where he was fifth in the championship, which he hoped would propel him into the British Formula 3 Championship the following year. However, even though he did perform one test in a British Formula 3 car, he was unable to find the funding necessary and did only 5 races for James Crofts Racing in the 1996 TVR Tuscan Challenge. National and international GT racing Campbell-Walter's Harrier from the 1998 British GT Championship. In 1997, Campbell-Walter returned to racing, taking a drive in the TVR Tuscan Challenge, a one-make trophy organised by the British manufacturer. He took fourth place in the series championship after winning two rounds for Colin Blower Motorsport. Blower, who was in charge of development for the TVR Cerbera's motorsport program, invited Campbell-Walter to co-drive with him in the racing Cerbera in selected rounds of the British GT Championship. The pair won the Donington Park round before the both of them made their debut in the FIA GT Championship at the 4 Hours of Donington Park, retiring after 38 minutes. The following year, Campbell-Walter stayed with Colin Blower for the TVR Tuscan Challenge, where he took five wins but was only able to finish fourth in the drivers championship once more. In the British GT Championship, he moved to the Harrier team, finishing 21st in the overall classification and 10th in the GT1 class. A move to Lister Racing in 1999 saw Campbell-Walter take his first ever drivers championship, winning the British GT title driving alongside Julian Bailey in the Lister Storm GT1. The pair took seven wins in eleven rounds, including the Oulton Park Gold Cup, and lead the Blue Coral G-Force Porsche 911 GT1 driving line-up of Magnus Wallinder and Geoff Lister by 20 points, securing the championship before the season was even over. Having taken part in selected rounds of the FIA GT Championship in the previous season, Lister Racing made a full force assault on the international series in 2000, retaining the line-up of Campbell-Walter and Bailey. The duo were once again successful, taking the GT1 title with 59 points after five wins in ten races. Campbell-Walter also won the two rounds of the British Championship he took part in, alongside David Warnock, and won six events with a partial season in the TVR Tuscan Challenge. At the end of the season, Campbell-Walter was awarded the John Cobb Memorial Trophy for most outstanding performance by a British driver in international competition. For the following three seasons, Campbell-Walter remained at Lister Racing, taking another seven wins, and finishing fifth (2001), third (2002) and sixth (2003) in the drivers championship. Over those years he was partnered by Tom Coronel, Nicolaus Springer and Nathan Kinch. In 2002 it was awarded by Autosport Magazine Best international GT driver. In 2004, Lister reduced its commitments to GT racing and Campbell-Walter moved to privateer Creation Autosportif. However, Creation's Lister was not as competitive as the works car had been on previous years, and Campbell-Walter, driving alongside partner Jamie Derbyshire scored no podium position and finished the championship in 13th place. In 2005, he made a lone appearance in FIA GT to drive in the Spa 24 Hours for Russian Age Racing, taking the wheel of a Ferrari 550 Maranello. In 2006 Campbell-Walter also drove for the Red Bull BMW team in the Silverstone 24 hours race and won the race, his first 24-hour victory. In 2007 Campbell- Walter once again won the Silverstone 24-hour race in the Red Bull BMW team and also won the Dubai 24 hours race with the same team and car. For 2010 & 2011 Jamie joined the Sumo Power GT Team driving the infamous Nissan GTR in the FIA GT1 World Championship. The first was a huge success for such a new car and Campbell-Walter was teamed up with Warren Hughes. For 2011, Campbell- Walter has stayed with the team and has been joined by David Brabham youngest son of 3 time Formula One World Champion Sir Jack Brabham. For 2012, Campbell- Walter drove for Gulf Racing in a Mclaren MP4 12C with Stuart Hall and Roald Goethe. They contested the Blancpain Endurance series including the famous Spa 24 hour race. For 2013, Campbell-Walter was signed up by Aston Martin as a factory driver. He contested the FIA World Endurance Championship in an Aston Martin V8 Vantage GTE. A hugely successful year, winning 2 races and finishing on the podium 4 times going on to win the championship. This included a 4th- place finish at Le Mans 24hrs. Le Mans and prototype racing Following their years in FIA GT, Creation Autosportif bought its own prototype program, having acquired the Reynard-built DBA 03S from RN Motorsport, later becoming known as the Creation CA06/H. Campbell-Walter was partnered with Nicolas Minassian for the 2004 Le Mans Endurance Series, taking two pole-positions and podium positions at Nurburgring and Spa. In 2005, the team's fortunes improved and Campbell-Walter and Minassian (occasionally partnered also by Jean-Denis Délétraz) achieved a second place at Silverstone, a third place at Spa, and another third at Istanbul. Campbell-Walter also made his competition debut at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, following a failed attempt in 2003, where his Lister Storm LMP was crashed in qualifying. The Creation team took fourteenth place overall and seventh in class, with Campbell-Walter driving alongside Minassian and Andy Wallace. For the 2006 season, while Creation expanded to two cars later in the season, Campbell-Walter was forced to drive an Aston Martin DBR9 on occasion for Cirtek Motorsport. Once reunited with Creation, he drove alongside Felipe Ortiz and Beppe Gabbiani to take third place at Donington. He also ran at Le Mans with Ortiz and Gabbiani, but retired three hours before the finish with engine failure. For 2007, he was once more a driver for Creation Autosportif, driving alongside Shinji Nakano and Felipe Ortiz, taking the first points for the Creation CA07 at Nurburgring. Campbell-Walter achieved one podium in Interlagos, Brazil. Then contributed to getting the team's second and third podiums of the year at Laguna Seca and Petit Le Mans.(USA) In 2008, Campbell-Walter suffered an accident at Monza, breaking 4 vertebra in his back, he escaped death after having a wishbone fail at 195 mph.

As a surgeon, he trained with Thomas Starzl, who had pioneered liver transplantion in humans. In 1992-1993, as a member of Thomas Starzl's team at the University of Pittsburgh in the United States, he conducted two baboon-to-human liver transplants. He founded the ISMETT organ transplant center in Palermo, Sicily; Marino was the CEO and the Director of ISMETT from 1997 until 2002. In 2001 he performed the first organ transplant in Italy for a person with HIV. In the United States he has held chairs as Professor of Surgery at the University of Pittsburgh and at the Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia. From 2009 to 2015 he was a member of the center-left Democratic Party and held a seat in the Italian Senate from 2006 until his election as mayor of Rome. He was elected Mayor of Rome in June 2013. Shortly after his victory in the elections, he was approached by an organized crime network that rigged public contracts and embezzled funds. Marino took the case to prosecutors, starting the 2014 Rome corruption scandal. On 12 October 2015, Marino resigned from the Office of Mayor amidst an expense scandal that had been made by the opposition parties of M5S and Fratelli d'Italia, but on 29 October he retired the resignation.https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/08/rome-mayor-resigns- amid-expenses-scandal-ignazio-marino Nevertheless, on 30 October he was ousted from his position after 26 of the 48 members of the City Council resigned. On 7 October 2016, Rome court acquitted Marino over the allegations of embezzlement, fraud, and forgery which he had stepped down to prove his innocence, the court decided for a full acquittal and ruled that Marino's actions \\"did not constitute a crime\\" and that the alleged facts \\"did not take place,\\" according to article 530 of the Italian C.P.P. Currently, Ignazio Marino is Professor of Surgery at the Thomas Jefferson University, School of Medicine, and Executive Vice President of Thomas Jefferson University and Jefferson Health in Philadelphia.https://www.jefferson.edu/leadership.html  Biography   Early life and education  Marino was born in Genoa to a Sicilian father and a Swiss mother and is the oldest of three children (he has two sisters). He graduated in Medicine and Surgery from the Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore in Rome.  Medical career  Board-certified in General and Vascular Surgery, he spent 4 years training in the 2 most prestigious transplant centers in the world: the Transplantation Institute of the University of Cambridge, England (then the only liver transplantion division in Europe), directed by Prof. Sir Roy Y. Calne. During his time in Cambridge, Dr. Marino published a paper on the reperfusion syndrome occurring during liver transplantion (Transplantation, 1985). The paper is still quoted today as a thorough study of this complex clinical syndrome; and the Pittsburgh Transplantation Institute at the University of Pittsburgh, directed by Dr. Thomas E. Starzl, the pioneer who in 1963 performed the first liver transplantion on a human being. In Pittsburgh, Dr. Marino completed an American Society of Transplant Surgeons approved multi-organ transplant fellowship under the direct leadership of Dr. Starzl and was hired by him as an attending physician and a Faculty member in 1991. Pittsburgh was then by far the most active Liver transplantation center in the world: for example, in 1990-1991 alone, more than 1,000 liver transplantion were performed at the Pittsburgh Transplantation Institute. In 1988, Marino published on Cancer https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10970142 the first paper ever showing that the Hepatic Epithelioid Hemangioendothelioma could be successfully treated with liver transplantion Marino IR, Cancer, 1988 s://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Epithelioid_hemangioendothelioma.jpg. In 1992 Ignazio Marino was appointed Associate Director of the National Liver Transplant Center of the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Veterans_Affairs of Pittsburgh, then the only Liver transplantation department of the Government of the United States. Marino was a member of the surgical team which in June 1992 and January 1993 performed two baboon-to-human liver xenotransplants in a clinical trial coordinated by Starzl.. In 1995, Marino published a paper showing, for the first time, that the age and sex of the donor are linked to different patient survival after liver transplantationMarino IR, Hepatology, 1995. In 1997 Marino founded the ISMETT (Mediterranean Institute for Transplantation and Advanced Specialized Therapies) organ transplant center in Palermo, Sicily. Marino was the CEO and the Director of ISMETT from 1997 until 2002, the first liver transplantion center in Sicily, founded through a partnership between the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and the Ministry of Health of the Government of Italy https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Health_(Italy)of the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Government_of_Italy. In 2001 he performed the first organ transplant in Italy on a person with HIV undergoing highly active antiretroviral therapy—a kidney transplant made in response to a personal request from the patient himself (along with the donor, his father), who had been turned down by other Italian transplant centres. A clinical success, the operation sparked an institutional dispute in Italy at the time. https://www.galileonet.it/lhiv-esclude-il-trapianto/ In 2002 Marino moved to Philadelphia at the Thomas Jefferson University. At the Thomas Jefferson University the liver transplantion Program was in need of general reorganization. Under Dr. Marino’s lead, clinical outcomes started to improve dramatically. Thomas Jefferson University’s 1-year liver transplantion patient survival rate went from 78% to 100% and Thomas Jefferson University’s 30-months liver transplantion patient survival rate went from 56% to 92% according to a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaplan%E2%80%93Meier_estimator actuarial curve. Ignazio Marino is the recipients of several international medical awards, including but not limited to the 2010 Award for contributions to the fight against AIDS http://www.npsitalia.net/?p=1145; Honorary Doctor of Science degree (2015) at the Thomas Jefferson University; the Longmire Professorship of the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Geffen_School_of_Medicine_at_UCLA and the Longmire Surgical Society Societyhttp://surgery.ucla.edu/visiting-professors. Marino has personally performed over 650 transplants. Marino delivered more than 700 international scientific lectures and is the author of over 500 peer- review articles and has authored several scientific books. In 2005 he published a book with Einaudi (\\"Le Vele\\" series) entitled Credere e curare (\\"Treating and Believing\\"); the book deals with the medical profession and the influence that faith, seen as a religious creed but also as compassion, solidarity, and empathy towards all human beings, has upon it. In 2005 he founded Imagine ONLUS, an international non-profit organization engaged in international solidarity activities with special regard to health issues. He is also a member of the Editorial Board of Transplantation, Liver Transplantation, Clinical Transplantation, and 9 other international scientific journals. Ignazio Marino is Professor of Surgery at the Thomas Jefferson University, School of Medicine, and, from 2020, Executive Vice President of Thomas Jefferson University and Jefferson Health in Philadelphia.https://www.jefferson.edu/leadership.html In 2020, Marino was appointed Member of the Board of Directors of the Philadelphia International Medicine https://www.philadelphiamedicine.com/.  Political career   Entry into politics  A good friend of Massimo D'Alema, Marino was persuaded by him to enter into politics as an independent candidate with the Democrats of the Left in the 2006 general elections, and was elected as a Senator. On June 6, 2006, Marino was elected Chair of the Health Committee http://www.senato.it/leg/15/BGT/Schede/CommissioniStoriche/0-00012.htm of the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_of_the_Republic_(Italy). Among the main achievements of Senator Marino as Chair of the Health Committee http://www.senato.it/leg/15/BGT/Schede/CommissioniStoriche/0-00012.htm: \\\\- a national law was proposed and approved to manage and reduce patients' waiting list time and to establish new rules for public/private physicians' practice in Italian National Health Care System hospitals; \\\\- a law proposal on living will that started a national debate; \\\\- an international meeting on living will from the clinical, bioethical and religious perspectives, attended by the President of Italy; \\\\- a national law was proposed and approved that allocates 180 million euro per year for a total of 10 years to patients who have been infected (hepatitis, HIV) during hospital care; \\\\- a national law was proposed and approved to allocate dedicated funds in the national budget law for researchers under 40 in the biomedical field according to peer review criteria by an international committee - a dramatic innovation in the Italian research funds allocation system. Given his professional background, in his new capacity, he promoted several legislative activities mainly dealing with healthcare, education, scientific research, and bioethics. Following the fall of Romano Prodi's government and an early election held in 2008, he was confirmed in the Senate, where he was appointed whip of the Democratic Party in the Standing Committee on Health and Chair of the Investigative Committee on National Health System http://www.senato.it/leg/16/BGT/Schede/CommissioniStoriche/0-00084.htm. In his second tenure as a Senator, Marino gained public exposure due to his strong support for the right to die and a clear advance health care directive law during the dramatic final days of Eluana Englaro, which caused widespread debate and a constitutional crisis within Italy. Following such events, Marino has become recognizable in Italian politics as a strong advocate of a lay country, gaining vocal support from left-wing parties and the Italian Radicals, but also being criticized by socially conservative politicians also within the Democratic Party, such as Paola Binetti. During his mandate, he has promoted: \\\\- a national study on quality assurance and outcomes of all major healthcare districts in Italy; \\\\- an investigation on the much-debated and controversial death of an inmate; \\\\- a national investigation on mental illnesses and psychiatric care; \\\\- a national investigation on severe disabilities and their treatments; \\\\- a national investigation on corruption in the National Health Care System; \\\\- a national investigation on hospitals built-in or near earthquake areas. In June 2009 he publicly announced his intention to run as a candidate for the Democratic Party leadership election in October. His leadership election platform was mostly focused on social rights, public health and environmentalism. He came third in the election, winning 12.5% of the votes. Mayor of Rome Marino ran the 2013 election for Mayor of Rome with the support of a centre-left alliance. After leading in the first round he was elected (on 10 June) Mayor of Rome at the second ballot, winning 63.9% of the votes in a run-off against the centre-right candidate, the incumbent mayor Gianni Alemanno. Among Marino's projects has been the visionary but controversial closing of the Via dei Fori Imperiali and Piazza di Spagna to cars and opening to pedestrian and bicycle traffic only. Mayor Marino cited his experiences as a cyclist in Philadelphia as the foundation for his having learned to live without a car.http://articles.philly.com/2013-12-18/news/45298798_1_ignazio-marino-via- dei-fori-imperiali-schwinn Shortly after his victory in the elections, he was approached by an organized crime network that rigged public contracts and embezzled funds. Marino took the case to prosecutors, starting the 2014 Rome corruption scandal. Ignazio Marino is the only Mayor of Rome ever invited to the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting (Davos, January 22-25, 2014) http://www3.weforum.org/docs/AM14/WEF_AM14_PublicFigures_List.pdf At Davos Marino networked with the Coca Cola CEO, Muhtar Kent, and the McKinsey CEO, Dominic Barton, to discuss philanthropic fundraising for the archeology in Rome https://www.ansa.it/web/notizie/regioni/lazio/2014/01/22/Marino- Fondazione-Roma-fund-raising_9945768.html On October 18, 2014, Marino registered the marriages of 16 same-sex couples who requested it to the Municipality, which followed similar acts by other Italian mayors. Same-sex marriages and civil unions were illegal in Italy at the time, and by registering the marriages, Mayor Marino hoped to force the hand of national legislators to clarify a deepening legal muddle around same-sex unions, particularly for Italians married abroad. Same-sex civil unions were eventually legalized in Italy in 2016. On 12 October 2015, Marino resigned amidst an accusation of expense scandal that had been made by the opposition parties of M5S https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Star_Movement and Fratelli d'Italia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fratelli_d%27Italia_(political_party), but on 29 October he retired the resignation. Nevertheless, on 30 October he was ousted from his position after 26 of the 48 members of the City Council resigned. He was replaced by a government-appointed commissioner. On 7 October 2016, Rome court acquitted Marino over the allegations of embezzlement, fraud, and forgery that had been made by the opposition parties of M5S https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Star_Movement and Fratelli d'Italia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fratelli_d%27Italia_(political_party)and after which he had stepped down to prove his innocence. The court decided for a full acquittal and ruled that Marino's actions \\"did not constitute a crime\\" and that the alleged facts \\"did not take place,\\" according to article 530 of the Italian C.P.P. Court of Italy In summary, upon his election, he found Rome on the verge of bankruptcy http://www.tuttosumarino.com/. In 2013, Rome was in the red with a loss of $888 million. Furthermore, its public transport system had a loss of $951 million. In 28 months Ignazio Marino balanced both budgets. He also conducted intense fundraising activity, attracting national and international resources, involving philanthropists who were interested in supporting Rome’s activity to preserve its archeological heritage. On the whole, in 28 months he raised over $14 million (€ 13.167.313). Among his decisions as Mayor: • the promotion of a new development plan that brought to the requalification of abandoned urban areas and to a total of private investments close to $2 billion; • the closing of Rome’s landfill, the largest in the world, and the promotion of efficient policies of the differentiated waste collection; • the opening of a new subway line with 21 new stations covering a total of 18 km railways; • the cutting of internal excessive spendings and the creation of a single purchasing center; • involving tax police officers to check the city books left by previous administrations; • the close collaboration with prosecutors investigating on mafia affiliations; • the pedestrianization of large portions of the city center; • the registration of same-sex unions, still unregulated under the Italian law; • the protection of large green areas from real estate speculation. Return to Medicine and Surgery In 2016, Ignazio Marino returned to the USA where he is Professor of Surgery at the Thomas Jefferson University, School of Medicine, and Executive Vice President of Thomas Jefferson University and Jefferson Health in Philadelphia.https://www.jefferson.edu/leadership.html At Jefferson he started a new curriculum for medical students: a selected group of students will attend the School of Medicine for 3 years in Europe and 3 years in the US and, eventually, they will be able to practice medicine in both continents.https://www.profignaziomarino.com/mc/498/rome-and- philadelphia-make-medical-history Dr. Marino is working with the Noble Laureate Alvin Roth to implement a new method aimed at increasing kidney transplantation.https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/tri.13656https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/tri.13656 Notes and references ;Notes ;References Category:1955 births Category:Living people Category:Italian transplant surgeons Category:Italian Roman Catholics Category:People from Genoa Category:University of Pittsburgh faculty Category:Thomas Jefferson University faculty Category:Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore alumni Category:Democratic Party (Italy) politicians Category:21st-century Italian politicians Category:Mayors of Rome Category:Members of the Senate of the Republic (Italy) Category:People of Sicilian descent ","title":"Ignazio Marino"},{"id":"12417169","text":"David Hargreaves FAcSS (born 1939) was educated at Bolton School and Christ’s College, Cambridge.

History Famous for the Demdike family of Pendle witches who lived there in the 17th century. Newchurch used to be called 'Goldshaw Booth' and later 'Newchurch in Pendle Forest', however this was shortened to 'Newchurch in Pendle'. St Mary's Church at the centre of the village is steeped in history. The church is not easily visible from the road, as it lies on the downward side of a steep hill, with a row of houses at the top and the primary school, St Mary's Church of England School, to the side. There was a chapel of ease on this site in 1250 and a later chapel was dedicated in 1544. The tower, although restored, is the only remaining part of that building. The current church was probably built in the 17th century, it was only completed in 1740. The \\"eye of God\\" is built into the west side of the tower. To the east of the porch, up against the south wall, is the grave of a member of the Nutter family (carved with a skull and crossbones). Local legend has it that it's the last resting place of Alice Nutter, one of the famous Pendle witches. However, executed witches were not normally buried in consecrated ground, and the skull and crossbones is a common memento mori device used to remind onlookers of their own mortality. So it can be fairly confidently asserted that the legend is in fact a myth. Every August, since 1949. the ancient ceremony of rushbearing has been performed. There is a procession around the village and the new Rushbearing Queen is crowned, followed by a service of thanksgiving in the church.

The civil parish of Woolbeding with Redford has a land area of . The 2001 census recorded 158 people living in 70 households, of whom 83 were economically active. History Woolbeding House Woolbeding was listed in the Domesday Book (1086) in the ancient hundred of Easebourne as having 24 households: 14 villagers, 5 smallholders and five slaves; with woodland, ploughing land, meadows, a mill and church, it had a value to the lord of the manor of £6. Woolbeding Bridge across the River Rother is a medieval one, with three arches and two cutwaters. The large 18th century country house, Woolbeding House, is a Grade I listed building. It was the home of the late Simon Sainsbury of the Sainsbury supermarket family. The National Trust owns the Woolbeding Estate, which includes Woolbeding and Pound Commons which are Sites of Special Scientific Interest. Telegraph Hill, from Woolbeding, was the site of a station on the semaphore line from London to Portsmouth which operated from 1822 to 1847. It was previously called \\"Holder\\" or \\"Older\\" Hill. In 1861, the parish's area was , with a population of 338. Parish church All Hallows parish church is a Grade I listed building. The oldest parts of the church are Saxon. The tower is small, with eight short pinnacles in a vaguely medieval style. It was built in 1728 but it has lancet windows that look like re-used Saxon or Norman ones. The present chancel is Gothic Revival and was built in 1870 but the nave has tall Anglo-Saxon proportions, with plain pilasters from ground to roof, and a blocked doorway. There are more pilasters on the north wall, including a truncated one with traces of a filled-in window above it. The quoins are of large stones. These features suggest a Saxon date for the main body of the church. Inside the church is a wall monument to Lady Dame Margaret Mill, wife of Sir Richard Mill of Woolbeding, daughter of Robert Knollys, Esq., of \\"Grove Place, Co. Southampton\\", died 1744, aged 56. The coat of arms shown is Per fesse Argent and Sable, a pale, and three bears salient, two and one, counterchanged, muzzled and chained Or, (Baronetcy created 1619). impaling Gules, on a chevron Argent three roses of the field, a canton Argent (recte: Ermine ). Next to a wall that separates the churchyard from the grounds of the manor house is a miniature mausoleum with Tuscan columns and square pilasters, with a frieze of military trophies such as pikes, rifles, cannon, battleaxes, drums and a helmet. There is a line of ancient yew trees near the church. Woolbeding poets The English Romantic poet Charlotte Turner Smith lived at Woolbeding House in the mid-1780s. Two poets grew up in the parish, each the son of a Rector of All Hallows parish, but in different centuries: Thomas Otway (1652-1685) and Francis William Bourdillon (1852-1921); whose father was Rector from 1855 to 1875.

Greening attended Montello Primary School and Parklands High as he grew up in the industrial town of Burnie in northern Tasmania. Recruited by Collingwood Football Club, Greening moved to Victoria in 1967 aged 16, and attended Northcote High School. He made his senior debut for the club the following year in a game against Hawthorn and became a regular in the side, playing as a ruck rover, half forward, centreman and wingman. He played 94 consecutive games with the club until a major injury on 8 July 1972 during a game against St Kilda. His next game with Collingwood was to be two years later, a match against Richmond. Such was his impact by 1972 that he finished the 1972 season with a 7th placing in the Brownlow Medal, despite only playing 14 games - an average of one vote per game, if the last 'injury game' is included in the calculation. In the Magpie's round 14 (8 July) encounter with St Kilda he had suffered severe cerebral concussion as a result of a hit received during the game. The incident took place after Greening had taken the first mark of the game, he kicked the ball towards Peter McKenna in the goal square and was floored afterwards by St Kilda player Jim O'Dea. Greening, who was comatose for 24 hours and didn't regain full consciousness for several days, was considered lucky not to die or at least be permanently disabled. \\"Whatever happened - and I didn't see it - I think part of what did happen is he hit the ground and his head hit the cricket pitch... I looked down at Johnny and it gave me a dreadful fright. It was a horrific sight... he was severely hurt.\\" Thompson and fellow Magpies were distraught, some thought Greening would die. \\"St Kilda's Jim O'Dea received a 10-match suspension for the incident, but Peter McKenna recalls that the initial fear as Greening's teammates ran towards their prostrate young wingman was that they would find him dead.\\" Greening rarely spoke of the incident, \\"It is not a pleasant anniversary for me... I was about 14 days in a coma... I went through pretty depressive times and still do... It only takes one act of stupidity or violence... and that is the end of the ball game.\\" During 1974 he surprised the footballing community by returning to the VFL, gathering 24 possessions in his comeback game. He managed just a further two games for the season and a total of six games during 1975 and 1976 before leaving Collingwood. \\"I made the comeback just to prove that I could do it and that was about all. Then I sort of stepped back.\\" Greening then continued his football career for a few years, playing with a number of other senior clubs in Victoria and Tasmania. These included Port Melbourne in the VFA, Cooee in the NWFU and City-South in the NTFA. Fellow Magpie Len Thompson described Greening in 2006, \\"Now we can say he was of the style we see today - with that great running skill... I think he was probably like a Robert Harvey ... he had magnificent balance, he used both sides of his body and he had this big ticker to run and cover ground.\\"Michael Gleeson, (9 Jul 2006), 'Sour end to what might have been', The Age, accessed on 1 Sep 2007 at: \\"He was probably the most talented player I ever played with,\\" said brilliant Magpie full-forward, Peter McKenna, who can recall Greening's spectacular return against Richmond 18 months (after his concussive 'hit' behind play), but only for a handful of senior games.Linda Pearce, (17 Aug 2003), 'Clubs use new game plan in dealing with trauma', The Age, accessed on 2 Sep 2007 at: During July, 2007, Collingwood Football Club paid tribute to Greening in a tribute to its past Greats of the game. Subsequent to the event, the club released the following as part of its tribute:\\"Everything about John Greening bore the stamp of a champion - superb skills, sure hands, and an outrageous spring. He was quick, courageous and fair.\\" On 2 July 2007, 35 years after the 'Greening Incident', Collingwood honoured Greening by a tribute prior to their Sunday home game. In 2011, Greening was awarded life membership of the Collingwood Football Club. In March 2011, Greening was inducted into the Collingwood Football Club Hall of Fame. After football, Greening moved to Queensland and worked as a 'bookmaker'.

He was one of the two original founders of the important liberal journal, the Analytical Review. Life Christie was born to Alexander Christie (brother of the Unitarian writer William Christie), a merchant in Montrose, Scotland in 1761. Christie attended a local grammar school and subsequently became a clerk in a bank. Deciding that he was more interested in literature and science, Christie studied medicine independently and then matriculated at the Westminster General Dispensary in London in 1784. At the same time, he began writing a series of articles on natural history for the Gentleman's Magazine and became friends with its editor, John Nichols. Although he attended the University of Edinburgh in 1785 and 1786 to earn his medical degree, he left the program to dedicate himself to a life of letters. In 1787 Christie took a six-month tour of Britain, visiting almost every important town. He met and began a correspondence with Anna Seward, a poet living in Lichfield; he also made the acquaintance of the naturalist and poet Erasmus Darwin, the naturalist and antiquary Thomas Pennant and the Dissenting minister and scientist Joseph Priestley. In 1788 Christie and Joseph Johnson founded the highly influential Analytical Review, a periodical dedicated to open inquiry. It became the mouthpiece for reformers during the 1790s. A year later, he published the first part of Miscellanies, Philosophical, Medical, and Moral, the work for he which is best known. It discusses topics ranging from theology to public education to history. During 1790 Christie spent six months in Paris, meeting many important French revolutionaries such as Mirabeau, Sieyès and Necker. Upon his return to Britain, he became a loyal supporter of the revolution and published A Sketch of the New Constitution of France. In 1791, he was one of the many who participated in the Revolution Controversy begun by Edmund Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790). His reply, Letters on the Revolution in France and the New Constitution, described his impressions of Paris and provided a contrast to Burke's depiction of it as lawless and violent. In 1792 he returned to Paris and was asked by the National Assembly to help translate a polyglot edition of the constitution. On 9 September 1792 Christie married a Miss Thomson and entered into a partnership with her grandfather's successful London carpet manufacturing business. In 1796 he traveled to Suriname on business and died there.Christie, R. C. and Alexander Du Toit. \\"Thomas Christie.\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Oxford University Press (2004).

Peters). It stars John Carradine, Myron Healey, Allison Hayes, Marilyn Buferd, Arthur Batanides, Sally Todd, and Tor Johnson. The film was written by Jane Mann and John D.F. Black. Plot At his psychiatric institute, Dr. Charles Conway (John Carradine) is surreptitiously experimenting with artificial glands to try to create longevity; he works with his minion Lobo (Tor Johnson) and his assistant Dr. Sharon Gilchrist (Marilyn Buferd). Conway receives his test subjects through an associate, Dr. Loren Wright (Roy Gordon), who delivers patients seeking treatment for lesser conditions. After this, they are then taken into the operating room for Conway's illicit surgery. Wright delivers his newest find, Grace Thomas (Allison Hayes), who is seeking treatment for depression. When Conway balks at Wright for bringing him a patient with living relatives, he confides in Conway that he plans to throw Grace's purse and bags into the bay, to fool family and the authorities into believing she had committed suicide. He then asks Conway for a demonstration of his experimental progress; Conway takes him down into the basement, where he introduces him to Harry Jedrow (Harry Fleer), his latest victim. Jedrow is clearly alive, but severely disfigured and in a vegetative state; this concerns Wright, who reveals that Jedrow's sister is currently seeking him out. Conway is furious, since none of his patients were supposed to have ties of any kind. That night, Lobo (who famously delivers the line \\"Time for go to bed!\\") discovers Frank Scott (Myron Healey) roaming around the grounds. Scott attempts to conceal his identity, but Conway quickly deduces that he is an escaped convict from his description in the newspapers, as well as a telltale tattoo on his wrist. Rather than turn Scott into the police, he offers him the chance to take part in his experiments. Knowing the odds are stacked against him, Scott accepts his offer. Scott is introduced to Grace the following morning, along with the two other patients: Danny Green (Arthur Batanides), who is being treated for anger issues, and pretty young Natalie Andries (Sally Todd), whose treatment schedule for a nervous breakdown is nearing completion. After demanding Wright to make out a certificate of death for Harry Jedrow, Conway happily informs Natalie that one last treatment for her is all that's necessary. While the other patients sleep, Natalie is sedated, taken to the operating room, and given an artificial gland along with a high dosage of electricity. The procedure backfires, and she ends up a senile old woman. They hide her in a back room. Lobo is ordered to bury Jedrow alive, but Frank Scott sneaks out to the burial site and opens the coffin. Jedrow rises out of it and escapes, and Lobo - not having been alerted - buries the casket. Sharon confronts Conway about his apparent affinity for Grace, and requests that she be made the next patient to be experimented upon. Meanwhile, Scott begins attempting to reveal to the other patients that Dr. Conway is carrying out horrific deeds to their friends. After a failed attempt to reveal Natalie's fate, he manages to show Grace and Danny what had happened to her, only to get caught by Dr. Conway and Sharon. They detain Scott and Danny and prepare Grace for surgery. Danny helps Scott escape by distracting Lobo, who fatally shoots him before being knocked unconscious. Scott confronts Dr. Conway with Lobo's gun and reveals that he is not a convicted murderer; he is actually Lt. Mark Houston, an undercover police officer sent to the psychiatrist's business to investigate it. Dr. Conway evades arrest, but is murdered by Jedrow. Lobo comes in and kills Jedrow, but Chambers' police backup arrive soon afterward and arrest Lobo and Sharon, barely saving Grace from the procedure. The police go downstairs and find Danny's body, and then discover a menagerie of beastly men, all failed subjects of Conway's longevity experiments.

It is one of the Fair Youth sonnets, in which Shakespeare writes of an unnamed youth with whom the poet is enamored. Sonnet 102 is among a series of seemingly connected sonnets, from Sonnet 100 to Sonnet 103, in which the poet speaks of a silence between his Muse and himself. The exact date of writing is unknown, and there is contention among scholars about when they were written. Paul Hammond among other scholars believes that sonnets 61-103 were written primarily during the early 1590s, and then being edited or added to later, during the early 1600s (decade). Regardless of date of writing, it was published later along with the rest of the sonnets of the 1609 Quarto. In the sonnet, the poet writes of why he has stopped showering his muse with flowery praise and adoration. In his analysis of Shakespeare's Sonnets, David West suggests that the sequence of sonnets 100-103 and the silence described are a response to the infidelity of the Fair Youth in the Rival Poet sequence of sonnets (78-86), which has caused a rift between the poet and his Muse. He writes of how immediately following the Rival Poet sonnets, the Poet begins to speak of his lover being false and having forsaken him. West claims that this ultimately culminates in sonnets 100–103, where the Poet expresses his regret over what has transpired. Paraphrase In this sonnet, the speaker is explaining that though he has been writing poetry in adoration of his muse less frequently, his feelings for him are as strong as they've ever been. Gwynne Blakemore Evans believes that this is an attempt to apologize for a period of silence. The poet goes on to explain that his silence is simply him not wanting to cheapen his praise by making it common. Below is a paraphrase of the sonnet written in prose: My love is stronger than it's ever been, even though my love may seem to have diminished. I do not love less, even though I don't show it as much. Love becomes a commodity when it's spoken of too highly and too frequently. I used to sing my praises very frequently when our love was new, like the nightingale which sings in the summer and stops at summers end. It's not that the summer is less pleasant for the nightingale, it's simply that the songs of other birds fill the air, and when things become common, they become less dear. It's for this reason, I, like the nightingale, have stopped writing. I do not wish my poems to become boring. Structure Sonnet 102 is an English or Shakespearean sonnet. The English sonnet has three quatrains, followed by a final rhyming couplet. It follows the typical rhyme scheme of the form abab cdcd efef gg and is composed in iambic pentameter, a type of poetic metre based on five pairs of metrically weak/strong syllabic positions. The 8th line exemplifies a regular iambic pentameter: × / × / × / × / × / And stops her pipe in growth of riper days. (102.8) The 1st and 3rd lines have a final extrametrical syllable or feminine ending: × / × / × / × / × / (×) My love is strengthened, though more weak in seeming; (102.1) :/ = ictus, a metrically strong syllabic position. × = nonictus. (×) = extrametrical syllable. Context Sonnet 102 is a part of the Fair Youth sequence, and it is also connected with the surrounding sonnets (100, 101, and 103) in detailing a silence that has arisen between the poet and his muse. David West contends that this sequence may be in response to the Rival Poet sequence. The Rival Poet sequence of sonnets mention a rival for either the affections of the Fair Youth, or that they are addressing other writers that may be a \\"worthier pen\\" (Sonnet 79). There is a rather long list of people that scholars believe are likely candidates for the title of the fair youth addressed in the Sonnets: William Herbert, Earl of Pembroke; Philip Herbert, Earl of Montgomery; and Henry Wriothesley, Third Earl of Southampton are the most common candidates. There has also been speculation of the identity of the Rival Poet. George Chapman and Christopher Marlowe, are typically considered to be the two most likely rivals, due to their publicity, profession, relations, and standing with Shakespeare during the presumed time of writing. Exegesis Overview While there is no consensus as to what specifically has caused the silence that has grown between the speaker and his muse, sonnet 102 seems to be an attempt to mend the relationship by claiming that he still loves as strongly as he ever has. Katherine Duncan-Jones has given the following overview: \\"Still claiming to have fallen silent, the poet claims that he loves just as much, though he shows it less, for fear of wearisome repetition.\\" Quatrain 1 In the first quatrain the poet describes that he has become quiet about the love he has for his muse, but this does not mean that his love is less. Rather, he claims that it is for the exact opposite reason. Carl Aitkins feels that the tone established here is like an tangential thought from Sonnet 100 and Sonnet 101. Publishing sonnets about his love have become a kind of currency. This is a use of a common proverb of the time: \\"He praises who wishes to sell.\\" David West suggests that this may also be viewed as an attack at the Rival Poet, in an attempt to cheapen the Rival Poet's love. Quatrain 2 In the second quatrain, the poet elaborates upon his sentiments made in the first quatrain, comparing the present silence to the relationship when it was new. He uses seasonal imagery to set up his atmosphere, which he continues to use in line three, where we also encounter an allusion to the myth of Philomela, which can be a poetic name for the nightingale. In Ovid's Metamorphoses, the myth of Philomela involves Tereus, the King of Thrace, who kidnaps his wife's sister, Philomela, and then he rapes her and cuts out her tongue to silence her.Allen Mandelbaum (translator). Ovid. The Metamorphoses of Ovid (New York: Harcourt Brace, 1993) Book VI. There is contention among scholars as to whether Shakespeare actively utilizes the Philomela allusion, Stephen Booth contends that there is \\"no active reference to Philomela.\\" This is to say that Stephen Booth feels that Shakespeare is not invoking Philomela for any reason beyond the poetic name for the nightingale. In A Moving Rhetoricke, however, Christina Luckyj contends that the Shakespeare views the Fair Youth's silence as a violation of the same magnitude as Tereus's rape of Philomela, and the cause of the poet's silence. Since his lover has betrayed him in favor of the Rival Poet, he chooses to silence himself. On line 8, \\"His\\" is the word which appears in the original 1609 Quarto. Katherine Duncan-Jones has edited this to become \\"her,\\" as many scholars think that \\"his\\" may be a misreading of the manuscript, which may have read \\"hir\\". This change is frequently made by editors, as Philomel is referred to as feminine throughout the rest of the sonnet. However, there are scholars who defend the use of \\"his\\". Stephen Booth simply contends that this is done to move away from the mythological allusion and focuses on the nightingale: It is the male nightingale that sings. While David West also offers a defense of the use of \\"his,\\" his reasoning differs greatly from Booth. West contends that Shakespeare used his for a variety of reasons, among his reasons being to avoid \\" the embarrassment of comparing [his lover] to a female.\\" Another reason defense put forth by West is a difference in language. In Elizabethan times, his was used as a neutral pronoun, often used where a modern writer would use \\"its\\". Quatrain 3 The third quatrain continues the metaphor of the nightingale and seasonal imagery to further stress that the poet's silence is not because their love is less pleasant. The nightingale is used as a metaphor to explain that just because he does not flatter the Fair Youth, does not mean that he loves less. As one scholar put it, \\"too much praise ceases to please\\". The poet explains his silence further in line 11, that the wild birds physically burden the tree branches as well as crowd the air with their songs. This may represent the myriad of love sonnets being published in attempt to flatter and please their muses. A similar interpretation of line 12 by Katherine Duncan-Jones is given, in which she claims that the poet is addressing the many circulating love sonnets as somewhat redundant, describes them as \\"pleasures which have become familiar are no longer intensely enjoyable\\". This is a usage of another common proverb; \\"Too much familiarity breeds contempt.\\" Couplet The couplet summarizes the sonnet in two lines, \\"Therefore, like her, I sometime hold my tongue, because I would not dull you with my song\\". This is a clear statement from the poet vocalizing for the final time that he will not dull, bore, or represent his muse in a tedious way by creating a sonnet as exhausted and clichéd as his contemporaries. In his analysis of the couplet, Stephen Booth compares the couplet to a proverb: \\"My desire is not to dull you, if I cannot delight you.\\" Booth suggests that the poet does not wish to make his lover seem common with overabundant praise. Aitkins similarly suggests that the poet does not wish his praises to become annoying. Helen Vendler suggests that the poet uses proverbial language here to address the Fair Youth's seeming obsession with receiving praise; a personal plea would fall on deaf ears, so he makes his case rather impersonal.

This is not the case in the ACC. Pastors and leaders can be ordained as long as they meet certain conditions set by the ACC, yet the academic conditions do not require that candidates have studied at Alphacrucis or any other registered ACC college. At one level this allows for an autonomy at a local church level which is unheard of in mainline churches. However, it also has called into question how there can even be a true and official ministry training college for the ACC. Mainline churches generally require a bachelor's degree in either ministry or theology plus units which cover the denominational distinctives. This usually equates to about five years full-time higher educational study. Again, at the ACC this is not the case. In fact the minimum academic requirement by the ACC is that candidates \\"have undertaken a recognised Bible study course and/or given evidence to the interviewing committee that he/she is equipped by private reading and study to fulfill the relevant ministry.\\" This generally equates to a Certificate IV in Ministry. This is in line with ACC's understanding of priority of the empowerment of the Holy Spirit over and above academic training and allows a lot of autonomy at a local church level. But again, it has called into question how there really can be any official training colleges for the ACC, as whether someone has studied there or even done any formal study at all is unnecessary for ordination.

It lies approximately 5 miles south-east of Basingstoke on the other side of the M3 motorway from the town. As a parish it is grouped together with Cliddesden, Dummer and Farleigh Wallop. History The name Ellisfield derives from the Old English word ielfsanfeld, meaning open land of Iellfsa. At the time of the Domesday Survey (1086) Ellisfield was part of the estate of the Bishop of Bayeux. It was held by Hugh de Port and later the St Johns. The manor was held by a favourite of Henry VIII, Sir William Sandys, in 1496. He later became Lord Chancellor and was created Baron Sandys. In 1657, the fifth Lord Sandys served with Charles I at the Battle of Cheriton. The property was sold and divided, to be reformed in 1789 by John Wallop, Earl of Portsmouth. Demography Ellisfield has a population of approximately 250 people.In 1871 the population was 245. William White (1878) History, Gazetter and Directory of the County of Hampshire. p. 225 Landmarks There is a pub, The Fox, and a church, St Martin's, which has 13th-century origins. There is no school or local shop, with primary-age children being educated usually in either Preston Candover or Cliddesden village schools. There are 12 listed properties in the village, including the church, which is Grade-II* listed. Part of Ellisfield has been designated as a conservation area by Basingstoke & Deane Borough Council. The conservation area comprises four of the settlements that lead to the creation of the village: Merritt's Farm, Ellisfield Manor, The Old Manor and Ellisfield Green. All are joined by a series of lanes running east/west, linking the A339 with the B3046. Part of this route formed the Harrow Way, an ancient trackway across Southern England from Dover to Stonehenge and then Cornwall. The remainder of the village lies outside the Conservation Area, further south along Green Lane, College Lane and Axford Road. Affordable housing has been built outside of the conservation area at Farrier's Field on land donated by the Earl of Portsmouth (who owns the Farleigh Estate).

Born in Kolkata, Bhattacharya grew up and studied in Kolkata and London. As a journalist, he has worked on The Times (London), The Sydney Morning Herald, India Today magazine (New Delhi), The Telegraph (Kolkata) and the Hindustan Times. He is currently the Editor of Hindustan Times, Mumbai. His essays and literary criticism have appeared in a number of publications across the world, including The Guardian, The Observer, The Independent, New Statesman, \\"Granta\\" and Wisden in Britain; The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald in Australia; Sports Illustrated in South Africa; and The New York Times. Bhattacharya's first book, a work of narrative non-fiction called You Must Like Cricket?, was published across the world to critical acclaim in 2006. Part reportage, part travelogue, part cultural politics, You Must Like Cricket? is a memoir that explores how India's identity got so closely tied to a game and the troubling hold that cricket has over him and a billion other of his countrymen. Writing about the book in The Guardian (London), the cultural critic Mike Marqusee called it 'highly entertaining' and said it was an 'heir to a tradition harking back to cricket's first literary classic, John Nyren's The Cricketers of My Time, published in 1833.' You Must Like Cricket? was one of the notable books of the year for the award-winning Observer Sport Monthly magazine in the UK. All That You Can't Leave Behind, Bhattacharya's second book, was a sort of sequel to You Must Like Cricket?It was published in India in 2009, and in the UK in 2011. Historian Ramachandra Guha called it 'a vivid and empathetic account of the highs an lows of cricket watching in contemporary India'. Writing about it, author and columnist Peter Roebuck said: 'Combining personal touches, socio-economics, emotion and statistics... it is a rich tale told with the sentiment of a supporter and acumen of a historian'. Bhattacharya's third book (and first novel), If I Could Tell You, appeared almost simultaneously with All That You Can't Leave Behind in December 2009. A haunting and tender novel, If I Could Tell You has at its heart the universal themes of longing, love and loss. Written in prose of beauty and power, it is a story about how luck and chance and a twist in events can irrevocably alter our lives, how love can lead to catastrophe, and, ultimately, about how the new India can make - and then break - a man. Greeted by several glowing reviews, the novel entered India's national bestsellers list on publication. It was nominated for the Crossword Book Award, and shortlisted for The Hindu Best Fiction Award. The author Vikram Chandra wrote of it: 'This is a remarkable novel by a writer whose work we will read for years to come.' He is most recently the author of the fatherhood memoir, \\"Dad's the Word\\". Bhattacharya lives with his wife and daughter in Mumbai.

The term, of French origin, originally referred to types of bodice or jacket with long tails, and in later usage a long corset, characterized by a close, contoured fit and extending past the waistline over the hips. It is so called because the original French fashion for long women's jackets was adopted from Basque traditional dress. In contemporary usage it refers only to a long item of lingerie, in effect a brassiere that continues down, stopping around the waist or the top of the hips, the lower part essentially decorative rather than providing support or indeed warmth. In Victorian fashion, basque refers to a closely fitted bodice or jacket extending past the waistline over the hips; depending on era, it may be worn over a hoopskirt (earlier Victorian era) or bustle (later Victorian era). A basque bodice (i.e., when considered as a dress component, to be worn with a specific skirt) could also be referred to as a \\"corset waist\\", because of its close fit. The modern French-language usage is completely different, much closer to the historic original, and usually used in the plural. Torsolette In 20th century and contemporary attire, the term is used to refer to certain articles of lingerie, particularly a type of corset known as a torsolette, or alternately a torso-hugging camisole that resembles a corset (typically featuring decorative front or back lace-up detail), but of more delicate construction and offering little or no figure-moulding compression. Instead the modern basque usually emphasizes allure, with details such as frilly lace and cutout, \\"peekaboo\\" designs, and sometimes garters (suspenders in British English) to join to stockings. The undergarment is similar to a Victorian-era corset, but with less compression of the ribs. The modern-day torsolette features lace-up or hook-and-eye fastening, as well as boning or vertical seams for structure and support. It usually, though not always, has brassiere cups and is distinguished from the bustier by its length. In American English, it is sometimes known as a \\"merry widow\\" (or \\"merrywidow\\").

Among his most notable accomplishments, he was a founder of the University of Frankfurt and Metallgesellschaft AG, which became the largest non-ferrous mining company in the world and the second largest company in Germany. Early life and education Wilhelm was born to a Jewish family,Jewish Virtual Library: \\"Merton family\\" retrieved November 29, 2017 the eighth of nine children of Ralph Merton (until 1856: Raphael Lyon Moses) and his wife Sara Amelie Cohen (daughter of Philipp Abraham Cohen), who immigrated to Frankfurt from England in 1837. On 5 November 1855, Ralph Moses and his family gained citizenship of the free city of Frankfurt. On 27 November, he was granted permission to call himself ‘Merton’ after claiming in his application for such (on 22 October 1856) that his brother Benjamin had already taken the family name ‘Merton’ in Manchester as the name ‘Moses’ was not suitable to be used as a surname. Wilhelm Merton studied at Frankfurt’s grammar school, thereafter in Munich and he performed voluntary work at the Deutsche Bank in Berlin. He married Emma Ladenburg in 1877 (born 1859 in Frankfurt, died in 1939), who was a daughter of Eugenie Halphen (1829–1866) and the businessman Emil Ladenburg (1822–1902), co-owner of the famous Ladenburg banking house. The couple had five children: Adolf, Alfred, Walter Henry, Gerda, and Richard. Merton and his children converted to Protestantism in 1899. The Mertons—who had been English citizens hitherto—naturalised as Germans in the same year, and thereafter he bore the name Wilhelm Merton. Metallgesellschaft AG Merton's father had married the daughter of Philip Abraham Cohen who operated a metal firm which he became executive of upon his father-in-law's death.Jewish Virtual Library retrieved December 22, 2017 In 1881, Wilhelm Ralph Merton succeeded his father and soon took full control of the firm by bringing in outside investors, Leo Ellinger and cousin Zachary Hochschild, to get full ownership and incorporated it as a joint stock company named Metallgesellschaft AG. The Metallgesellschaft, with 40 employees and one telephone—the first telephones were installed in Frankfurt in 1881—at the outset traded in copper, lead, and zinc, later diversifying into nickel and aluminum. Over the next hundred years, it grew into a company of over 20,000 employees with $10 billion revenue. It had over 250 subsidiaries specializing in mining, specialty chemicals (Chemetall), commodity trading, financial services, and engineering. Initially in 1881, close business as well as personal ties had been formed with the firm of Henry R. Merton (HRM), the metals trading firm of the English branch of the family, named after another of Ralph's sons. Since German mines could not satisfy the country's metal requirements, the company rapidly developed extensive relations abroad and within a short time Metallgesellschaft was represented in such cities as Basel, Amsterdam, Milan, Brussels, Stockholm, St. Petersburg, Moscow, Vienna, and Paris. Within a few years, therefore, a network of subsidiaries spanned the globe. In 1887, the American Metal Company was founded in New York City; in 1889, the Companhia de Minerales y Metales in Mexico and the Australian Metal Co. The last was the result of an expedition the company organized together with HRM and Degussa into the ore-rich Broken Hill district, where lead and lead concentrates were produced in vast quantities. This constituted the start of Metallgesellschaft's trading in ore, which would assume greater and greater importance in the future. Although Wilhelm Merton is recorded in autobiographical notes as saying of Metallgesellschaft that: \\"Our trading company will not be involved in any kind of advertising\\" and is credited with the remark that it would be far more pleasant \\"to be able to pursue one's business without the need of the stock exchange, the public or the press,\\" he broke fundamentally with his principles in one important way—the publication Metallstatistik, which had appeared annually since 1892, giving an overview of metal production, consumption, and prices worldwide, made Metallgesellschaft's name, to quote Wilhelm Merton again, \\"known, and I might add, respected.\\" In general, however, Wilhelm Merton strongly objected to any interest in the firm which he considered to be excessive. The First World War hit Metallgesellschaft hard. The good relations established abroad were broken off, imports of raw material dried up, the sister company HRM fell under the British Non-Ferrous Metals Industry Bill of November 1917, designed to eliminate enemy influence and control over the British ore and metal trade, and the deliveries of Australian ore failed to appear. This meant Metallgesellschaft had to obtain its metal supplies from neutral countries for as long as possible and eventually to use up domestic sources or intensify their exploitation. Three aluminum works were built, in conjunction with the firm Griesheim Elektron: in Horrem, close to Cologne; in Berlin-Rummelsburg; and in Bitterfeld near Halle. Wilhelm Merton died suddenly of a heart attack on 15 December 1916 in Berlin after having already heart troubles for a long time prior. He was buried in the main graveyard in Frankfurt. His sons took over the control of Metallgesellschaft: Alfred Ralph Merton, the eldest son, was the chairman of the supervisory board, while Richard Ralph Merton, the second-born son, later became chief executive. Achievements On account of his socio-political endeavours primarily, Wilhelm Merton is regarded as one of the most prominent German entrepreneurs in the Wilhelmenian period. He proved himself to no lesser degree in the financial world, in the period up until the beginning of the First World War, as the founder of initiatives aimed at humanising the economic world through scientific means. He founded the ‘Institute for Community Wellbeing’ in 1890, and in 1901 the ‘Academy for Social and Trade Sciences’, both in Frankfurt. He was the driving force, with Franz Adickes (then Mayor of Frankfurt), in founding the University of Frankfurt. Johann Wolfgang Goethe-University, as it was later called, became one of the most advanced universities of its time as a result of it adopting Merton’s idea of having a scientifically orientated university which was geared to the demands of modern economic society in terms both of education and of research. The Wilhelm Merton Professorship and the Wilhelm Merton Centre for European Integration and International Economic System at the Frankfurt Goethe-University, the Wilhelm Merton Scholarship and ('Merton District') in Frankfurt, on the former work site of the ‘Unified Germany Metal Works’ (a subsidiary of Metallgesellschaft), are all named after him. Additionally, a vocational business school and a street in Bockenheim are named after him. See also *Zachary Merton (brother) References Literature * Hans Achinger: Wilhelm Merton in seiner Zeit.

He was born in Greensburg, Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania. U.S. Ambassador, Romania, 1925–1928, Chile, 1928 - 1933. Colonel, United States Army.

The Porter Prize is awarded by The Kingsley Trust Association (The Scroll and Key Society) for a work of scholarship which, through original effort, gathers and relates facts and/or principles to make a product of general human interest. A review of this work by Worthington C. Ford appeared in September 1912. Ford reviewed the essay positively, noting nationalism is the \\"key-note\\" of the essay, lauding its \\"breadth and candor,\\" but stating that \\"more could be made of Hamilton's own venture into a manufacturing concern...\\"  William S. Culbertson Papers, 1923  Culbertson was a member of the Institute of Politics, an organization that promoted the study of international problems and relations \\"with a view to creating a more sympathetic understanding of the ideals and policies of other nations.\\" To carry out its ideas, the Institute of Politics in July and August 1923 held a series of roundtable conferences at Williams College, Massachusetts. In addition to the roundtable conferences, there were two open conferences, one of which was led by Culbertson who at that time was president of the U.S. Tariff Commission (now called the United States International Trade Commission). Culbertson discussed \\"Problems of Raw Materials and Foodstuffs in the Commercial Policies of Nations.\\"  International Economic Policies, A Survey of the Economics of Diplomacy, 1925  In 1925, Culbertson published a book looking at post World War I economics and international interests. This book shows Culbertson's early leanings toward a U.S. foreign policy of reciprocity. According to a review by E. L. Bogart of the University of Illinois at Urbana, Culbertson spends most of the book discussing commercial treaties, tariffs, and open-door policy. Bogart believes that Culbertson truly understands the \\"gravity and complexity of the international problems presented by the unequal geographical distribution of raw materials and fuels.\\" He believes that Culbertson disapproves of both laissez-faire economics and economic imperialism, instead promoting a policy of international cooperation, to be effected through an organization such as the League of Nations.  Reciprocity, A National Policy for Foreign Trade, 1937  In 1937, Culbertson published a book supporting the Hull reciprocal trade policy. According to a review by George H. E. Smith, Culbertson's thesis is that \\"[The United States has] become a world state... Our overseas expansion will go on whether we like it or not... Our production, our finance, and our trade then must operate on a world stage. If they are confined within our political frontiers by a narrow nationalism, no amount of governmental regulation and of governmental generosity will bring about real prosperity... I have become convinced that we cannot possibly pay out nationally except through a tremendous revival in foreign trade, both imports and exports, which in turn will stimulate and enlarge domestic trade and enterprise.\\" The book continues by discussing the evolution of tariffs and the mechanisms through which they are made, and concludes with suggestions for a permanent foreign trade policy.  The Culbertson Economic Mission, 1944 - 1945  In the fall of 1944, Culbertson led an economic mission on behalf of the United States to North Africa and the Middle East to survey post war prospects for business. This trip also included an independent assignment to France. According to analysis by John A. DeNovo, the mission revealed a strong belief in the free market for the regulation of international trade, analyzed obstacles to U.S. business in the Middle East, and revealed a vision of expanded U.S. involvement in Middle-East affairs. DeNovo also claims that the Culbertson reports were \\"taken seriously by those charting American economic policies.\\"  Liberation, The Threat and the Challenge of Power, 1953  Later in his life, Culbertson became a Colonel in the United States Army, with a role of influencing the Eisenhower Administration's global politics. In 1953, he published Liberation, The Threat and the Challenge of Power, in which he contrasts policies of liberation and containment of the Soviet Union. Culbertson supports liberation as a method of avoiding preemptive war and argues that containment would do nothing to stem Soviet development of \\"super- weapons,\\" but that American policies have considerable bearing on the practicality of liberation. Stefan T. Possony in a review of this work writes: > \\"Colonel Culbertson views liberation as just such a practical though complex > working philosophy -- the danger, as he sees it, is in failing to recognize > that we no longer can espouse the moral foundations of our way of life > without also embracing liberation. We cannot turn our backs on a world that > is half slave and hope to retain our own freedom. Such an attitude does not > necessarily entail global war. Colonel Culbertson would keep his powder dry > first and foremost, but he also visualizes a step-by-step use of all our > vast strengths -- moral, economic, political, spiritual and legal -- in a > gradual and controlled manner.

Auckland Town Hall and its surrounding context is highly protected as a 'Category A' heritage site in the Auckland District Plan. History Town Hall entrance from Queen Street Overhead view of the Town Hall at night Building Opened on 14 December 1911 by Lord Islington, Governor of New Zealand, the building is one of the most prominent heritage structures on Queen Street. Costing £126,000 (approximately $21 million in 2017) to construct, it was designed by Australian architects, JJ & EJ Clarke, their Italian Renaissance Revival building design being selected from among 46 proposals. The five-storey building was specially designed to fit the wedge-shaped piece of land that had been acquired for it in the 1870s at the junction of Queen Street and Grey Street. It bears a striking resemblance to the Lambeth Town Hall at Brixton, London, built at around the same time. The Town Hall formed Auckland's first permanent seat of both administration and entertainment in the city's history, with its Great Hall (seating 1,673 people) modelled on the Gewandhaus in Leipzig, and considered as having among the finest acoustics in the world. The exterior is constructed of two types of stone; the ground floor is made of a dark volcanic basalt, heavily rusticated, which contrasts with the pale stonework of the upper storeys. Oamaru limestone from the south island was used for the upper part of the building. The lower part is often assumed to be Auckland basalt but was actually sourced from Melbourne, in Australia. This was probably due to the architects already having a history of sourcing consistently good quality stone from the quarries there, as well as the availability of heavy duty steam saws to handle the notoriously difficult stone. The interior contains several varieties of English ceramic surfaces - tessellated floors and glazed ceramic wall tiles. The semi-circular Council Chamber is fitted with wood panelling and Art-Nouveau-style electric light fittings, while stained glass is a feature of all the main rooms. The ceilings throughout all the main floors are ornamented with good quality plasterwork, the Great Chamber being the most elaborate. The great four-sided clock in the building's tower was donated by Arthur Myers (MP and former Auckland mayor) and the Great Hall's pipe organ by Sir Henry Brett. The Town Hall project was championed by Myers before and during his time as mayor (1905-1909), and one of his last acts in office was to lay the foundation stone. The Town Hall's interior was extensively restored from 1994-1997 at a cost of NZ$33 million, partially because the unreinforced masonry structure did not meet earthquake standards. Australian engineering firm Sinclair Knight Merz pioneered various techniques to reinforce the structure without substantially changing the heritage character of the building.The Engineering Heritage of Auckland (dynamic link from the 'Heritage Walks' website of IPENZ) In 2007, the exterior underwent additional restoration work. A number of ornamental details on the exterior had been removed in the 1950s due to earthquake concerns, and some of the Oamaru limestone was damaged during aggressive stone cleaning. After careful research and analysis, these were replaced by limestone sourced from the same levels of the North Otago quarry that provided the original stone. Interior acoustic performance was corrected by the removal of earlier ill-judged and obtrusive intervention measures and their replacement by less- visible and more effective treatments. Interior paintwork was restored throughout to the original Edwardian-era colours. Complex fragmented porcelain and glazed ceramic tiling was restored with exact, new purpose-made replicas in the lavish main entrance foyer. The original carpet was recreated (for reference, a small portion of the original was left in one corner of the Council Chamber). The stained glass windows were restored and (where necessary), rebuilt and the entire building was unobtrusively fire protected. Town Hall Organ The organ after the restoration in 2010 The Town Hall Organ, dating from 1911, is the largest musical instrument in the country, and is itself a 'Protected Object' in New Zealand law. It was extensively remodelled in 1969-1970 when the organ reform movement reached New Zealand, significantly altering and reducing its original Romantic-era power, discarding many parts of the original, and adding new ones to produce a then- fashionable Baroque sound. The resulting compromised instrument was dismantled in January 2008 for restoration and rebuilding. The rebuilt organ, incorporating remaining parts of the 1911 original, some recently recovered components, and new elements, was built by Orgelbau Klais of Bonn, Germany. It returned to the Great Hall at the end of 2008, and was reassembled as the country's largest (and once again most powerful), organ. Auckland City had committed itself to providing NZ$3 million to the restoration project, with a $500,000 remainder obtained via private fundraising. The restored organ was officially unveiled on 21 March 2010, with a specially commissioned symphony. Auckland Philharmonia Orchestra In early February 2016, the administration staff of New Zealand's largest metropolitan orchestra, the Auckland Philharmonia Orchestra, moved into the vacant former mayoral office suite, making Auckland Town Hall, where the orchestra largely performs, its new home.

History The Swallow Fall by Crane, W., ca. 1840 Swallow falls is located on Afon Llugwy near Betws-y-Coed, in Conwy County Borough. It is thought that the English name arose from a mis-hearing of the Welsh word ewynnol (foaming) as the similar-sounding y wennol (swallow). It was suggested in 1899 that the falls could be used to generate electricity for the nearby village of Betws-y-Coed, as well as overhead lighting for the falls. In 1913 the second Lord Ancaster, the landowner, gave the Swallow Falls to the local council, who decided to charge for visiting it in order to pay off some of the £15,000 debt incurred through the installation of water and electricity supplies to the village. Once the debt of costs of installation was cleared the parish retained the fee, resulting in Betws-y- coed having the lowest rates in the country. By the 1930s, the waterfall had become a popular tourist destination, although there were few visitors during the winter off-season. A writer in the Yorkshire Post and Leeds Intelligencer on 17 January 1933, described the waterfall as coming \\"over the rocks in a perfect torrent, peerless white in the dusk.\\" In 1939, Richard Morris, the former chairman of the local council, was charged with making false entries in the upkeep of the tolls. There was a total deficiency of £67 15s 6d; by the time the charge was laid, Morris had already repaid the sum. The cheap water and electricity rates ended after Local Government re-organisation in 1974.

The French army was composed of about 2,500 knights and squires, supported by about 5,500 infantry. The Flemish, in contrast, fielded a town militia force of 9,000 consisting mostly of infantrymen. The two forces clashed on 11 July in an open field outside the Flemish city of Kortrijk and the battle ended with the overwhelming victory of the Flemish militia. The commander of the French army, Robert II of Artois was surrounded and killed on the battlefield. At least a thousand French cavaliers were also killed in the battle and the large number of the golden spurs collected from the field gave the battle its name. The battle was romanticised in 1838 by Flemish writer Hendrik Conscience in his book De Leeuw van Vlaanderen (). Declaration Following the establishment of the three cultural and linguistic communities of Belgium in 1970, the Dutch Cultural Community (as it was known then) enacted a law on 6 July 1973, which prescribes the flag, the anthem and the day of the Dutch Cultural Community. Ever since then the Day of the Flemish community is observed in Flanders. Private employers are not required to award a day's holiday; however the institutions of the Flemish Government and public employers observe this holiday.

The galleria-style shopping mall and tower is located at 1900 Northwest Expressway in the Penn Square trade area immediately at I-44 and Northwest Expressway, across from Penn Square Mall near the exclusive suburb of Nichols Hills. The complex consists of a 16-storey office tower, upscale retail shops on 3 levels , and a parking structure. Midland Oak Realty purchased the building from MBL Life Assurance for $15 million in 1997. The complex was later owned by a Dallas-based capital management company, which bought the building for $25.7 million in 2004, along with 25 tenants-in- common. A planned sale fell through in 2008. In March 2011, In-Rel Properties based in Lake Worth, Florida purchased the building for $15.25 million and invested over $1 million in renovations. 50 Penn Place is pictured in Oklahoma City, Thursday, March 15, 2012.

The fountain inside the office tower of 50 Penn Place, Oklahoma City, OK. History The complex was built in 1973 by C.W. Cameron, founder of American Fidelity. For the next twenty years it was a landmark due to four red piggy bank signs (One on all four sides of the Elevator tower on top of the building.) with a big \\"S\\" in the center, belonging to Sooner Federal Savings and Loan who had their home offices in the Building at the time. It was also formerly home to a couple of Oklahoma locally owned chain of high end retail stores such as Balliets a women's boutique and the flagship store of Orbach's which closed in 1990. Although not currently anchored by a major retailer, 50 Penn Place still has upscale shops and restaurants, a brewpub, independent bookstore, the 50 Penn Place Art Gallery, and various office tenants including LexisNexis. In recent years, the retail portion of the complex has lost the majority of its tenants to other nearby shopping venues, such as Penn Square Mall right across the street, and Classen Curve a newly built modern upscale shopping center in Nichols Hills. Because of this, 50 Penn Place is no longer seen by locals as an upscale shopping destination. However, several upscale tenants still remain, and former retail space is being leased to other tenants, such as ITT Technical Institute.

Alexander (1994) p. xi: \\"A minor point is the hyphen in the name; other family members used one, but Marie did not, so I left it at that\\". (23 December 1874 – 11 October 1969) was a Danish-born Australian novelist and physical culture teacher. She wrote nine popular romance novels between 1917 and 1937. Her novels were set in Australia, mostly in rural Tasmania, and represent an alternative vision of Australia to that of earlier writers. Marie Bjelke Petersen's biographer, Alison Alexander, wrote: \\"With her Danish background Marie was not steeped in the laconic lore of the bush propagated by the Bulletin and its school of admirers, and she set out to glorify her adopted land, to depict Australia as a cultured civilised place, with charming people (setting aside the villains), a quite different portrayal from that usually found in the literature of her day.\\"Alexander (1994) p. xi It has been claimed that her works were more popular in the United States and England than Australia.Wilde et al (1994) p. 95. Her biographer, Alexander (1994), questions this claim. Certainly Marie Bjelke Petersen was very well known in Australia as a novelist during the period in which she wrote. Her brothers founded physical culture institutes which continued to function through the end of the 20th century, and her nephew, Joh Bjelke-Petersen, became the Premier of Queensland. Life Marie Bjelke Petersen was the only daughter and second child of Georg Peter Bjelke-Petersen, a gardener and then master builder, and his wife Caroline Vilhelmine, née Hansen.Weidenhofer (1979) (Originally plain \\"Petersen\\" Georg hyphenated his name for unknown reasons sometime in the 1860s.Alexander (1994) p. 2) Marie went to school in Denmark, Germany and England but lived most of her life in Tasmania after emigrating with her parents and four brothers in 1891. She was naturalised in 1915. Marie Bjelke Petersen was trained as a painter in Denmark. She continued to paint for many years in Australia, mostly oil landscapes. She often wintered in Brisbane, Sydney or Melbourne where she would take a flat and hold religious meetings. She attracted a large following of young women as was common with female romantic novelists of her time. While she enjoyed mythology and would write notes to fairies in her garden, she was a committed Christian who \\"never overlooked the poor and needy\\". A conservative herself, she numbered among her friends Marie Pitt the poet and socialist activist who lived openly and indeed notoriously with her married lover.Alexander (1994) Gardening and reading were interests that Marie Bjelke Petersen continued into her nineties. By the late 20th century, Bjelke Petersen had become a gay and lesbian icon. She lived in an intimate relationship with Sylvia Mills, whom she met in 1898, for thirty years.Henningham (2007) It has been argued that her book The Captive Singer is about Mills. She was not necessarily a lesbian however, or at least not seen as such in her own time; close sentimental women's friendships were still not assumed to be sexual in 1920s Australia.Alexander (1994) p. 44-46 Career in physical culture In 1892, her brother Lt Col Hans Christian Bjelke-Petersen founded the Bjelke-Petersen Physical Culture School. (He is credited with building Australia's first squash court, shortly after World War I.) Marie was in charge of the women's section and taught there and at other schools before turning to writingAdelaide (1988) p. 15 in 1910 when injury meant she could no longer teach. In the mid-1890s, the Bjelke-Petersens learnt of the new game, basketball, that was becoming popular in the United States. Marie is credited with introducing drills designed specifically for players of the game into the physical culture program she taught in schools. \\"It can be argued, therefore, that Marie Bjelke Petersen was instrumental in introducing the sport of netball to Tasmania.\\"She's Game She was also a registered massage therapist. Writing career New York edition of \\"The Immortal Flame\\" 1919 She had short sketches and stories published in various newspapers and magazines before achieving success with her first novel. Three religious tracts were published as The Mysterious Stranger (1913), Before an Eastern Court (1914) and Muffled Drums (1914). The success of the first of these tracts helped her to find a publisher for her first novel, The Captive Singer (1917). It was based on a guide who sang at Tasmania's Marakoopa Cave and was a financial success selling 150,000 copies in English and a further 40,000 in Danish translation. This first novel established Marie Bjelke Petersen as a significant Australian writer. Bjelke Petersen approached Australian-born Hollywood actress Louise Lovely with her story Jewelled Nights suggesting it might suit Lovely. Louise Lovely liked the story and produced a film of the same name with her partner, Wilton Welch, in 1925.Significant Tasmanian Women However, it was not a commercial success, recovering £5,000 of its £10,000 production cost. The film had its critics, some regarded its primary weakness as its plotPike and Cooper (1998) p. 129 which involved a girl disguising herself as a boy. However the film was a popular success in Australia and overall the critics were friendly – another explanation was that this ambitious film fell victim to structural distribution problems facing the Australian film industry.Alexander (1994) p. 149: \\"The film's failure was caused not by a few critical reviews, but by the difficulty of breaking into a market controlled by a few chains of distributors showing American films.\\" Her novels were distinguished by a fresh literary take on Australian life, closely observed scenery and social background and, by the standards of the romance genre, comparatively non- stereotyped characterisation and plot. Despite her conservative politics they were also notable for their celebration of Australian egalitarianism and her promotion of women's rights at a time when (and a place where) the women's movement was largely quiescent. Her novels also reflected her devout Christianity. A striking feature of her novels was their intense feeling for landscape, almost to the extent of ascribing sentience to natural features. Her novels sold altogether around 250,000 copies in English, a phenomenal success for an Australian writer at that time. They were also translated into six languages, including Arabic.Alexander (1994) p. 198-199: 250,000; six languages; phenomenal success; and elsewhere (250,000 only referred to English language, Arabic one language) In 1935 she won the King's Jubilee medal for services to literature.

It is endemic to Cameroon. The specific name bornmuelleri honours Joseph Friedrich Nicolaus Bornmüller, a German botanist. Common names Bornmuller's caecilian and Bornmüller's caecilian have been coined for it. Like most species of its genus, it may be found at high elevations including Mount Cameroon. It was collected by Werner in 1893 and the holotype was collected by a local in an unknown location but its natural habitats may be subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests, plantations, rural gardens, and heavily degraded former forests. No exact threats are known but if the species relies on soil moisture and temperature maintained by vegetation, it may be threatened by habitat disturbance and agricultural activities including herbicides and pesticides. There has been habitat loss in its range but may be adaptable.

Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests, subtropical or tropical moist montane forests, rivers, and intermittent rivers. Taxonomy This species was first described by the American herpetologist Emmett Reid Dunn in 1942 as Rhinatrema nigrum, the type locality being Arundabara, British Guiana. It has been included in the genus Epicrionops as Epicrionops niger.Dunn, E.R. 1942. The American caecilians. Bulletin of the Museum of Comparative Zoology 91: 437–540. Distribution and habitat The black caecilian is native to south eastern Venezuela and western Guyana, and possibly northern Brazil. It occurs at altitudes of between in moist lowland and montane forests, cloud forests, seasonally dry forests, wetlands, marshes and the banks of temporary and permanent water courses. Only four specimens have been recorded, and it is likely that the range of this species is in reality wider than is currently known. Whether the species can adapt to secondary habitats is unknown. Ecology As an amphibian, this caecilian is likely to feed on insects, earthworms and other small invertebrates. Clutches of eggs have been found under rocks, where they are guarded by the female. The larvae probably develop in streams. Status The black caecilian has a wide distribution in an area with very little human disturbance, and is known to be present in Canaima National Park in Venezuela. Although the total population size is unknown, the species is believed to be common with few known threats, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\".

It is known from southern Malawi east of the Shire River, northern Mozambique, and Tanzania (including the Nguru, Udzungwa and Uluguru Mountains); the known distribution is discontinuous but the species is expected to occur in the intervening areas. Etymology The specific name kirkii refers to Sir John Kirk, a Scottish diplomat, naturalist, and explorer. Description Adults measure in snout–vent length; it is the largest Scolecomorphus species. There are 130–152 primary annuli (ring-shaped folds). The dorsal colouration is lavender-grey and extends to the sides such that it encroaches the flesh or cream coloured mid-ventral surfaces. It is possible that the colouration is aposematic. Scolecomorphus kirkii is assumed to be viviparous and not to depend on bodies of water in its reproduction. It is an efficient burrower that feeds on arthropods. Among its predators is the fossorial snake Atractaspis aterrima, based on a S. kirkii individual found in the gut of this snake. Habitat and conservation Scolecomorphus kirkii is a soil-dwelling species that occurs in montane and submontane forests, generally at elevations above above sea level but sometimes down to asl. It can also live in secondary habitats like fruit gardens and small-holder agricultural areas. It is locally abundant. It can probably suffer from habitat disturbance and conversion caused by deforestation and agricultural intensification, although it is not known whether these constitute significant threats.

His music has sold over three and a half million copies worldwide, releasing his debut album in 1987 and his last in 2007. O'Connor also composed music scores for film and television and is one of Australia's biggest selling instrumental musicians. His music sometimes utilises sounds from nature, and is very much focused on relaxation and what he called music therapy. His album, Mariner (1990), reached No. 40 on the ARIA Albums Chart in March 1993. Tony O'Connor died on 23 May 2010, due to a glioblastoma multiforme. He is survived by his life partner, Jacqui O'Connor and their child, Samantha Jane.  Biography  Tony O'Connor was born in 1961. BT Fasmer of New Age Music Guide observed, \\"Nature was very important to Tony. He used nature sounds quite heavily in his music, which added both life and context. He even stopped songs in the middle to feature nature sounds. For him birds singing or sounds of waves had a special musical quality... His music will be of special interest for fans of Medwyn Goodall and Clifford White, which both debuted in the late 1980s.\\" In the mid-1980s O'Connor moved to the Sunshine Coast hinterland with his then- girlfriend Jacqui O'Rourke O'Connor's first album, Journey was released in 1987, classified as \\"Creative Relaxation Music\\". O'Connor had previously worked with psychologists and masseurs to create music that was specifically produced to calm and relax the listener. As a result of the album's medicinal qualities, to relieve stress, depression, sleeplessness, and muscle tension, as well as to slow the heart and breathe rate of listeners and lower blood pressure, Journey became sought after by professional therapists and natural healthcare specialists. As demand for O'Connor's album grew, he and O'Rourke, established a recording studio and record label, Studio Horizons in 1988. This enabled his recordings to be sold to a wider audience, which resulted a jump in sales. By 1991, O'Connor had composed and produced, Mariner, which achieved gold status within a few weeks of release. Mariner reached No. 40 on the ARIA Albums Chart in March 1993. It has sold over one and a half million copies to date. Mariner was the first album that Tony enlisted long time guitarist and friend Paul Clement to provide guitar on his music. Paul accompanied him on future albums, and toured Australia with him. From 1992 to 1997, O'Connor collaborated with Australian wildlife photographer and publisher, Steve Parish. They combined to create a range of CDs set to particular nature themes, resulting in albums, Uluru, Kakadu, Rainforest Magic, Wilderness and Windjana – Spirit of the Kimberly. These were popular and sold in numbers unprecedented by any Australian Unsigned artist at the time; each title reaching Double Platinum sales, with two albums reaching Triple Platinum sales and one album selling more than half a million copies. Tony O'Connor was diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme late in 2008, he underwent surgeries but died on 23 May 2010 of the brain tumour. He is survived by his life partner, Jacqui O'Rourke (a.k.a. Jacqui O'Connor), and their child.  Composing and recording  An independent artist, O'Connor recorded all of his music in his own recording studio. Situated on a 42-acre rainforest property, \\"Hidden Forest\\" (also the name of an album and a song) on the Blackall Range in Queensland, he described it, \\"a most inspiring place to live and work\\", as the studio itself was positioned above the trees, where \\"...birdsongs fill the daytime... in winter a magical mist floods through the forest and surrounds the house. At night, the sounds are amazing... owls echo across the gorge, crickets and frogs lull us to sleep every evening.\\" O'Connor also recorded as he wrote, with most of his pieces beginning on the guitar or the piano and advancing from there. O'Connor wrote, or began writing, most of his pieces in the early morning, saying \\"...in the wee hours of the morning... I begin to hear/feel a melody and I simply cannot stop myself from sitting at the piano or picking up a guitar and trying to capture it... before it leaves.\\" O'Connor considered himself a guitarist more than anything else, claiming that many of his songs would begin on a guitar, even if there was no guitar in the final recording. He played a range of different guitars including 6-string steel string guitars, classical guitars and 12-string guitars. O'Connor mainly played Taylor Guitars, although he claimed that his favourite guitar was a hand-made Mirabook, built for him by Gary Albrecht, admitting, however, that he favoured a 'very special' Takamine Guitars Sante Fe classical. O'Connor's secondary instrument was the piano, in particular, a Yamaha C4 baby grand piano. O'Connor claims that this is where most of his composing came from. As well as the guitar and the piano, O'Connor also played the flute, both metal and wood based flutes, as well as an Electric Wind Instrument (EWI) which allowed for a wide variety of instrument sounds to be produced on one instrument. He also played percussion, the bass guitar and keyboards. O'Connor usually worked as a solo artist, playing all instruments in his recordings. He did, however, collaborate with guitarist, Paul Clement, on the album, Summer Rain, with songs co-written by both artists featured on the CD. Clement was also played the guitar on Mariner, Tales of the Wind, Bushland Dreaming, Lovesong, Live in Concert, Dreams and Discoveries and Whispering Sea. To record his music, O'Connor used AKG Acoustics and RODE Microphones mics on a Sony digital console. The microphones were first fed through two Amek Channel- In-A-Box units for equalizing and compression. All Taylor guitars were recorded directly using Fishman pickups. As O'Connor was passionate about achieving the best quality recording possible, the equipment he used changed as technology improved and, as a result, the exact equipment used to record each album is not known. Wind Seeker, however, was tracked, mixed and mastered within Emagic's Logic Audio software, using Digidesign digital interfaces on a Macintosh G4 466Mhz computer. The album was recorded in 24bit 44.1 kHz digital audio, however the final master was dithered to 16bit using Waves software plug ins.

With its subsidiary DiIT, Schleuniger is in involved in digitalization and industrial IoT. Most of the Schleuniger Group's customers are suppliers to the automotive, entertainment and information industries as well as for the communications sector. The company has development and production locations in Switzerland, Germany and China. The Schleuniger Group represents the wire processing business segment of the publicly listed Metall Zug Group and has more than 900 employees and 40 apprentices worldwide.  History  The history of the Schleuniger Group as it is known today started in 1991 when Dr. Gerhard Jansen (Chairman BOD until 2009) and Martin Strehl (CEO until 2009) acquired Sutter Electronic AG located in Thun, Switzerland. At that time Sutter Electronic AG had 30 employees and generated a revenue of 5 million CHF with wire processing machines and other processing equipment. In 1993 the new owners acquired Schleuniger Productronic AG, which had been founded in Solothurn, Switzerland. This company also produced wire processing machines, but additionally had access to the international market. Both companies were then integrated into a group under the already internationally established name \\"Schleuniger\\". In 1999, the Schleuniger Group took over their previously independent distributor \\"L+H Kabeltechnik\\" and secured direct access to Germany - its most important European market. Taking over the Swiss-based Kirsten AG in 2000 opened the crimping market for the Schleuniger Group and two years later Schleuniger entered the market for Plastic Optical Fiber (POF) and Flat Foil Cables (FFC / FPC) with the foundation of Schleuniger Flexon AG in 2002. Another 2 years later, Schleuniger took over the activities of the German \\"Grote+Hartmann Engineering GmbH\\" (GHWE) from the American Lear Corporation Inc., and developed fully automatic crimping machines, which are now produced by Schleuniger Automation GmbH in Radevormwald, Germany. Having been active in China through an independent representative for many years, Schleuniger opened a representative office in Shanghai in 2005, which was transformed into a trading company in 2007. In 2008, the Swiss Metall Zug Group took over the Schleuniger Group. The same year, Schleuniger took over PAWO Systems AG which became Schleuniger Solutions in 2009. In August 2009, Christoph Schüpbach succeeded Martin Strehl as CEO and Calvin Grieder succeeded Gerhard Jansen as Chairman in November 2009. A substantial investment was made in 2013 with the acquisition of the former Tianjin Haofeng Electrical Equipment Co., Ltd. headquartered in Tianjin, China. The new owners integrated the newly founded Schleuniger Haofeng (Tianjin) Machinery Co., Ltd. into the Schleuniger Group. Schleuniger Haofeng produces high-quality machinery for the wire processing industry. Prior to their acquisition, Tianjin Haofeng Electrical Equipment's 2012 posted sales were the equivalent of approx. 5 million Swiss Francs. Another acquisition was completed in Spring 2015 when the Cirris Solutions GmbH, headquartered in Jettingen/Germany became part of the Schleuniger Group. Due to its fully automated testing systems, Cirris Solutions is one of the global leaders in the field of applied testing technology and testing automation. Cirris Solutions GmbH has approximately 40 employees and generated translated sales of 7.2 million Swiss Francs in 2014 (currency exchange rate from Dec. 31, 2014).

He is a visiting fellow at the London School of Economics, specialising in the future of journalism. He was most recently Editor-in-Chief of International Business Times UK, Associate Editor at Newsweek Europe and head of its editorial panel, positions he quit after his 60th birthday in 2015. He co-founded Jericho Chambers, a radical development of communications consultancy modelled on a set of legal chambers, with Robert Phillips, a former CEO at Edelman, in June 2013. Previously, he was appointed Secretary for Public Affairs to the Archbishop of Canterbury in October 2010 and left the post a year later. He was Religion Editor of Telegraph Media from May 2008 and wrote a regular column and occasional leaders for the Daily Telegraph and a contentious blog for telegraph.co.uk. He left the paper in June 2010, six weeks after editor- in-chief Will Lewis abruptly departed after a strategic disagreement. Industrial editor He was Industrial Editor of The Observer between 1988 and 1991, during which his commentary on the high summer of Thatcherite utility privatisation led to the Industrial Society (the precursor to the Work Foundation) voting him National Newspaper Industrial Journalist of the Year in 1991. Luther Pendragon In 1992, he co-founded the communications consultancy Luther Pendragon with Charles Stewart-Smith, the television journalist. The firm grew through the 1990s off the back of major and often controversial clients such as British Gas, Kimberly Clark, Holocaust Memorial Day and the Hinduja family. Luther Pendragon lays claim to having developed the professional practice of issues management, but this is disputed in the PR industry. In 2005, the firm was subject to a management buy-out, said to be worth £11 million by the trade magazine PR Week. Church of England ministry Pitcher had undertaken training for ordained ministry in the Church of England and was ordained curate of St Bride's Church, Fleet Street, London – known as \\"the journalists' church\\". He was Associate Priest at St Bride's from 2008 to 2012. He was licensed as Priest-in-Charge to the Parish of Waldron in East Sussex in 2013. He is a regular broadcaster on religious matters and has organised topical debates in churches. Since 2006 he co- organised Christmas benefit concerts for churches and cathedrals with Ian Anderson of Seventies supergroup Jethro Tull. He occasionally attacks the conservative evangelical wing of the Church in print. He has also expressed concern about the entry of Anglican priests into the Catholic Church after the Holy Office accepted the creation of personal ordinariates for disaffected High Church traditionalists. He has been an outspoken opponent of the legalisation of assisted suicide and euthanasia in the UK. He has also criticised the National Secular Society on the grounds that its website used language about \\"campaigning\\", \\"fighting\\" and that \\"it reads entirely like it is fighting a war to expunge religion from people's lives, even to make it something of which to be ashamed and contemptuous.\\" IICSA Emails sent in 2010 between Andrew Nunn, former correspondence clerk at Lambeth Palace, and Pitcher while he was Lambeth communications director, were read out at IICSA, the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse, in 2018. The emails suggested \\"throwing\\" the then Bishop of Chichester, the Rt Revd John Hind, \\"to the press as a sacrifice\\", in the hope that it would distance Archbishop Rowan Williams from the abuse scandal and prevent the media from suggesting that the CofE’s abuse problem was as grave as that of the Roman Catholic Church. Pitcher insisted on social media that the Church should not see him as \\"the bad boy of its communications\\" and that in 2010 the prevailing culture inside Lambeth Palace was \\"to stonewall, to do and say nothing in response to abuse allegations.\\" Personal Educated at Blundell's School in Tiverton, Devon, he has honours degrees in Contextual Theology from Middlesex University (2005) and in Drama and Theatre Arts from Birmingham University (1977).

It is situated on the foothills of Western Ghats. Location There are two more places with the same name \\"Pangode,\\" one in Trivandrum district itself and the other in neighboring Kollam district. Of the other two places with the same name, one is located within Trivandrum city, where an Indian military establishment is based at and the other one is where an Ayurvedic Medical College is located. This Pangode is a village on the north east of Trivandrum district, located 45 km north-east of Trivandrum (Thiruvananthapuram) city, the capital of Southern Indian state of Kerala. Pangode Gram Panchayat falls under Vamanapuram block of Trivandrum district and is on the Karette-Palode Road. It is a border village of Kollam and Trivandrum districts. Pangode village is where the Grama Panchayat office and major government offices of the Panchayat are situated. Pangode Grama Panchayat was carved out of Kallara and Vamanapuram Grama Panchayats in 1977 by Government Order No: 883/77/LA dated 30/09/1977 with P A Rahim as its first President and Pattanikkada Shahul Hameed as first Vice President. Pangode Grama Panchayat is spread over an area of 23.31 km2, with a population of 30225, a female:male ratio of 1092:1000 and a literacy rate of over 90 per cent. Infrastructure A government Lower Primary School, a government aided Upper Primary School (KVUPS, Pazhavila) and an aided college are situated in Pangode village. A government High School is located in the nearby village of Bharathannoor, which is part of the Pangode Grama Panchayat, and is two kilometers away. The government aided college, Mannaniya College of Arts & Science, is established in 1995 by a charitable society Jamiya Mannaniya Islamiya and runs undergraduate courses under the University of Kerala. Also located in the village are a Police Station, a Post Office (PIN: 695609), a revenue Village Office, a State Bank of Travancore (SBT) branch and a Cooperative Bank. An Indian Overseas Bank branch is located in the nearby Bharathanoor. Economy Pangode is predominantly an agriculture-dependent village and most of the people have directly or indirectly been involved in agriculture for their livelihood. With the spread of rubber cultivations in the 1970s and 1980s in the eastern regions of Kerala, farmers of Pangode quickly moved over from Coconut and Paddy cultivations to Rubber, attracted by its high Return on Investment. In the 1990s, a lot of village youth traveled to the Middle East countries in search of jobs and, by now, a good number of adults from the village is working abroad and, therefore, remittance is also a good source of income. Flow of remittance has resulted in increase in the number of concrete buildings, replacing the old thatched and tiled houses. History Pangode has a history of participation in Indian Independence Movement. The Civil Disobedience Movement led by Mahatma Gandhi found its ripples in the village and a section of village farmers resorted to tax resistance. They refused to pay taxes for selling commodities at the Pangode and nearby Kallara markets in September 1939. A few local progressive thinkers and leaders led this mass movement against the British Raj and its representative who was ruling the Travancore province at the time, C. P. Ramaswami Iyer. A series of events led to a bloody incident in which a charged mob of agitated farmers attacking the Pangode police outpost and killing a policeman. In the ensued crossfire between the police and the agitators, two freedom fighters - Plankeezhil Krishna Pillai and Cheruvalam Kochu Narayanan Achary - were also killed. Soon, the police which was under the control of the Travancore Diwan C. P. Ramaswami Iyer cracked down on the movement. People involved in the ambush were arrested and later tried. First and 13th accused in the case - Kochappi Pillai and Pattalam Krishnan - were hanged till death on 17/18 December 1940 after the High Court confirmed the sentences awarded to them by the Sessions Court. Kallara-Pangode Struggle is declared by the Government of India as one of the 39 struggles that led to India gaining independence in 1947 from the British Raj. The 75th anniversary of the Kallara-Pangode Struggle was celebrated on 29 September 2013 inaugurated by the Kerala Chief Minister Oommen Chandy.

It was erected in c. 1228-1255 and later enlarged in the 14th-15th centuries, the original Romanesque edifice being turned into the current large Gothic one.  Architecture  The basilica is on the Egyptian Cross plan, with a nave covered by spans and a transept, according to type favoured by the Mendicant Orders, which needed spaces capable to house large crowds of faithful. The current interior looks rather sober after a fire in 1655 and the restoration of 1885-1892, when many of the Baroque altars were demolished (some of the paintings has been however returned in recent times). The neo-Gothic façade, flanked by the 1763 campanile, dates to the early 20th century. The medieval marble decoration and the 15th century portal were removed in that occasion. A stained glass window from the interior.  Interior  The counterfaçade houses the remains of two 14th century sepulchres, as well as two large fragmentary frescoes from the city gates of Porta Romana and Porta Pispini: a Coronation of the Virgin by Sassetta and Sano di Pietro (1447–1450) and a Nativity by Il Sodoma (1531). Also visible is the ancient 15th century portal by Francesco di Giorgio Martini. Among the numerous artworks in the church, are Madonna with Child and Saints by Jacopo Zucchi, an expressive Crucifixion by Pietro Lorenzetti and a fresco by his brother Ambrogio, a Prayer of St James by Giuseppe Nicola Nasini, a Martyrdom of St Martina by Pietro da Cortona and a Madonna with Child frescoed by Jacopo di Mino del Pellicciaio.

He spent his childhood in Salamina, memories of which influenced his artistic work all his life. He studied painting initially at the Athens School of Fine Arts and in 1875 continued his studies at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts of Munich, thanks to a scholarshipGreek Landscape Painting (19th - 20th century). From the collections of the National Gallery and the Euripidis Koutlidis Foundation, National Gallery and Alexandros Soutzos Museum, Athens 1998, p. 197. by the politician Dimitrios Voulgaris (\\"Tsoumpes\\"). In the academy he was taught by Wilhelm Lindenschmidt and Ludwig von Löfftz. In Munich he became a friend of the already known Greek painter Nicholaos Gysis.Ôï ÂÇÌÁ onLine - ÍÅÅÓ ÅÐÏ×ÅÓ In 1880, Lembesis returned to Athens and opened his atelier in the Thission district. Although he was a master in Landscape painting he became known more for his skills in portraiture. He began painting portraits of aristocrats and politicians of his age such as Kapsalis, Santarozas, Serpieris, Levidis and many more. He also taught painting to the children of many of his rich clients such as Stephanos Dragoumis, who later became prime minister of Greece. The Dragoumis family supported him for most of his life. He participated at many group exhibitions in Athens (Melas House 1881, Parnassos Literary Society 1885, Zappeion 1888 and 1896 etc.). In 1903 he participated at the International Exhibition of Paris; the next year his work was included in the artistic exhibition for the International Exhibition of Athens. Lembesis died very poor and largely unknown as an artist, perhaps due to a shift in Athenian artistic taste from the Munich School to more modern artistic movements inspired from Paris. He was buried in Salamina; to cover the cost of his funeral, his relatives had to sell all of his paintings for 2 to 3 drachmas per item. In the only obituary written about him, in the Spring of 1913, Pavlos Nirvanas said: \\"An honest and sincere artist has died almost out of tact exactly as he did for his whole life\\".Α.Σ.Ε. - Τέχνες - Πολυχρόνης Λεμπέσης Some decades after his death his work has been reevaluated, and today Lembesis is considered one of the most important representatives of the Munich School art movement.  Work  Lembesis' work is characterised by a particular skill in achieving perfect chromatic tones and a clarity of design. He is considered the most romantic of all the romantic painters of the Munich School. He admired Murillo, and often used in his works a similar contradiction of vivid light and dark colours to emphasise chromatically the scenes that he painted. Nude by Polychronis Lembesis National Gallery of Athens There are around 100 known works. Some of his most famous paintings that are exhibited at the National Gallery of Athens: Nude (Γυμνό), The Boy with the Rabbits (Το αγόρι με τα κουνέλια), The Artist's Niece (Η ανηψιά του καλλιτέχνη), A Portrait of my Brother (Προσωπογραφία του αδελφού του). Others are The Girl with the Birds (Το κορίτσι με τα περιστέρια) at the Averoff Gallery in Metsovo, and The Street boy (Το αλητόπαιδο) at the Telloglio Foundation in Thessaloniki. Lembesis was also known as a painter of religious scenes, to which he devoted himself after 1883. He moved his atelier to Stournara Street and was commissioned by many Athenian churches. Among his most famous religious works include those for the churches of Saint George Karytsis (Άγιο Γεώργιο Καρύτση), Saint Constantine (Άγιο Κωνσταντίνο) in Piraeus and Saints Theodoroi (Αγίους Θεοδώρους) of the First Cemetery of Athens.

Biography Pearson received his bachelor’s degree in engineering from Washington University in St. Louis in 1961, and his master's degree in geology from Wright State University in Dayton, Ohio, in 1977. After serving in the U.S. Marine Corps, he became an aerospace engineer for the NASA Langley and Ames research centers during the Apollo Program. He joined the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) in 1971, and developed vibration control for high-power lasers and a kinetic-kill vehicle concept for President Reagan’s Strategic Defense Initiative in the 1980s. As Chief of the AFRL Structural Dynamics Branch, he led the development of the high-temperature acoustics test facility at Wright-Patterson AFB in Ohio, which was used for high-speed missile testing and the National Aerospace Plane development.

The world is persistent, and consequences of mining and deforestation have to be managed. Plot Set in the kingdom of Fahren, legend states that a hero will save the world. Development It is the sequel to Cross Gate, a Japanese MMORPG from 2001. The game was developed by Square Enix and Ponsbic, published by Gamescampus, and run by Nexon and OnNet USA. Yousuke Saito was the executive producer, having previously worked on Star Ocean: Till the End of Time. Freelance illustrator Sunaho Tobe worked on the character designs. The game shares the \\"super deformed\\" character style common in manga comics. The game was released in Japan in 2007 after a January beta test with 10,000 people, ending in April and launching in May. In October 2007, Square Enix announced that Nexon would publish the game in North America, doing a public beta in the first half of 2008, with release in December 2008 by OnNet. It was beta tested through North American publisher OnNet with 5,000 people from July 1 to the July 14th of 2008. In 2007 a release for China was in development, and it launched on November 10, 2008 by Shanghai Everstar. A server for Taiwan was launched on April 10, 2009 by UserJoy Technology, and another for Hong Kong on 22nd of the same month. The game service ended on April 17, 2012 in Taiwan. In 2013, the service ended in China on February 20, in Japan on March 27, and in Hong Kong on March 28. The game service relaunched for Hong Kong & Taiwan on May 28, 2014. Music The music for the game was composed by Hiroki Kikuta, and the theme song by Kenji Ito. It is made up of orchestral music with Italian names for all the tracks, reminiscent of the traditional use of Italian words to describe a musical pieces mood. Since it was made in conjunction with Ito, Kikuta found it difficult to write the last two songs to complete the album and tie it together musically. One song that required a lot of effort, \\"Overture\\", became one of Kikuta's favorites. The soundtrack was released as an album through Kikuta's Nostrilia label with the title Concerto: The Extraordinary World of Concerto Gate in 2008. Drawing from the word \\"Concerto\\" in the title, the theme of the game's music was to be \\"harmony among many people\\". The album cover used was a painting called \\"Spring\\" by Lawrence Alma-Tadema. Reception Joystiq praised Concerto Gate for attempting to bring the excitement and frustration of the random battle system to an MMORPG. In 2009, Game Campus announced that Concerto Gate and five other games would be compatible with the ONE Power-Up Game Card for video game related micro transactions.

Background  Moody was born in Belfast, to a poor family who made their living from dressmaking and iron turning and was educated from 1920 to 1926 at the Belfast Academical Institution.Hughes- Warrrington, Marnie Fifty Key Thinkers on History, London: Routledge, 2000 page 232. Moody's parents both belonged to the Plymouth Brethren.Martin, F.X \\"Theodore William Moody\\" pages 5–7 from Hermathena, No. 136, Summer 1984 page 5. As a six-year old in 1913, Moody saw the homes of Roman Catholics living down the street go up in flames during a riot against the Home Rule bill, which left him with a lifelong horror of the sectarian hatreds that so often characterised Irish life.Martin, F.X \\"Theodore William Moody\\" pages 5–7 from Hermathena, No. 136, Summer 1984 page 5. At the Royal Belfast Academical Institution, Moody's strongest subjects were the sciences and Latin, but one of his teachers, Archie Douglas turned his attention to history.Hughes- Warrrington, Marnie Fifty Key Thinkers on History, London: Routledge, 2000 page 232. At the Queen's University Belfast, a professor James Eadie Todd encouraged Moody to pursue graduate studies.Hughes-Warrrington, Marnie Fifty Key Thinkers on History, London: Routlede, 2000 page 232. In 1930 he went to the Institute of Historical Research in London, and graduated with a PhD in 1934.Helen Mulvey, 'Theodore William Moody (1907–1984): an Appreciation', Irish Historical Studies, XXIV, November 1984, pages 121 – 130. Moody's doctoral thesis was published as the 1934 book The Londonderry Plantation, 1609–41: the City of London and the Plantation of Ulster.Hughes-Warrrington, Marnie Fifty Key Thinkers on History, London: Routledge, 2000 page 232. In 1922, the Irish Public Record Office in Dublin was burned down during the course of the Irish Civil War, and as historians have traditionally used government documents, much of Ireland's 17th century history was considered lost.Hughes-Warrrington, Marnie Fifty Key Thinkers on History, London: Routledge, 2000 page 232. Moody used instead the records of The Honourable The Irish Society as the consortium of companies that granted the right to colonise Ulster in the Derry area together with the papers relating to the plantation of Ulster that were to found the records of the Irish Society.Hughes-Warrrington, Marnie Fifty Key Thinkers on History, London: Routledge, 2000 page 232. The book was generally ignored in England, but was greeted with welcome reviews in Ireland, as a trail-brazing work that opened up new avenues on studying Irish history.Hughes-Warrrington, Marnie Fifty Key Thinkers on History, London: Routledge, 2000 page 232. During his time in London, Moody met his future wife Margaret Robertson and often spoke on the subject of Irish history with R. Dudley Edwards.Hughes-Warrrington, Marnie Fifty Key Thinkers on History, London: Routledge, 2000 page 232. Both Edwards and Moody agreed that the discipline of history in Ireland needed a “revolution” in terms of methodology, goals and style.Hughes-Warrrington, Marnie Fifty Key Thinkers on History, London: Routledge, 2000 page 232. In 1932, Moody returned to Queen's University to work as a teacher's assistant to Todd, and in 1935 Moody started to deliver lectures himself.Hughes- Warrrington, Marnie Fifty Key Thinkers on History, London: Routledge, 2000 page 232. In the 1930s he Feeling historians in Ireland worked too much in isolation, Moody founded in February 1936 the Ulster Society for Irish Historical Studies, and later that same year, Edwards founded the Irish Historical Society.Hughes-Warrrington, Marnie Fifty Key Thinkers on History, London: Routledge, 2000 page 233. A man with an intense work ethic and much energy, Moody wanted to bring up the standard of history in Ireland, which he felt needed improvements.Martin, F.X \\"Theodore William Moody\\" pages 5–7 from Hermathena, No. 136, Summer 1984 page 6. Moody was sympathetic towards Irish nationalism, but he detested violence.Martin, F.X \\"Theodore William Moody\\" pages 5–7 from Hermathena, No. 136, Summer 1984 page 6. In his obituary, Father F.X Martin noted that Moody was raised in the Plymouth Brethren, but he found his true faith as an adult when he became a Quaker.Martin, F.X \\"Theodore William Moody\\" pages 5–7 from Hermathena, No. 136, Summer 1984 page 5. Moody felt Ireland was in need of major social reforms, hence his personal heroes were James Connolly, James Larkin, and above all Michael Davitt, who preached a mixture of Irish nationalism, social reformism and non-violence.Martin, F.X \\"Theodore William Moody\\" pages 5–7 from Hermathena, No. 136, Summer 1984 page 6. Despite the border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Free State, Edwards and Moody worked together and in 1938 founded the Irish Committee of Historical Studies to ensure that Ireland was a member of the Comité International des Sciences Historiques.Hughes-Warrrington, Marnie Fifty Key Thinkers on History, London: Routledge, 2000 page 233. Later in 1938, Moody and Edwards founded the journal Irish Historical Studies, to promote the study of Irish history in a properly peer-reviewed journal.Hughes-Warrrington, Marnie Fifty Key Thinkers on History, London: Routlede, 2000 page 233 In June 1939, Moody accepted an offer to teach at Trinity College, the most prestigious university in Ireland.Hughes-Warrrington, Marnie Fifty Key Thinkers on History, London: Routledge, 2000 page 233 He held the position of Erasmus Smith's Professor of Modern History at Trinity College Dublin from 1940 to 1977, when he became professor emeritus.Dictionary of Ulster Biography In 1940, Moody defined his goals to: > “teach history in various fields, including the history of Ireland to > undergraduates; to encourage and direct research on Irish history, > especially by young history graduates; to set new standards of objectivity > and technical excellence in the conduct of the research and in the > presentation of its results; to promote and assist the publication of > articles and books based on such work, and thus to bring a new > historiography to bear on the teaching of Irish history; to encourage co- > operation among historians and communications between the historians and the > concerned public; and to contribute directly to the new > historiography”.Hughes-Warrrington, Marnie Fifty Key Thinkers on History, > London: Routlede, 2000 page 233 In 1943, Moody was promoted to the head of the history department.Hughes- Warrrington, Marnie Fifty Key Thinkers on History, London: Routledge, 2000 page 233 Moody was a popular teacher with enrolments in the history department rising steadily and Trinity acquiring a worldwide reputation as a centre of research on medieval and modern Irish history.Hughes-Warrrington, Marnie Fifty Key Thinkers on History, London: Routledge, 2000 page 233 Together with Edwards who now at University College in Dublin and David Quinn at Liverpool University, Moody persuaded the publisher Faber and Faber to launch a series called “Studies in Irish History” to allow his graduate students a chance to be published.Hughes-Warrrington, Marnie Fifty Key Thinkers on History, London: Routlede, 2000 page 234 With Robert Dudley Edwards, he founded Irish Historical Studies and The Irish Committee of Historical Sciences and began publication of A New History of Ireland.Helen Mulvey, 'Theodore William Moody (1907–1984): an Appreciation', Irish Historical Studies, XXIV, November 1984, pages 121 – 130. Moody also sought to give history a higher profile in Ireland. In 1953, Moody created the Thomas Davis Lectures on Irish radio, a series of half-hour lectures on various topics in Irish history.Hughes- Warrrington, Marnie Fifty Key Thinkers on History, London: Routledge, 2000 page 234 In 1954 he gave a 12-part radio lecture series on Northern Ireland Radio which proved to be so popular that Moody published them as the book Ulster Since 1800: a Political and Economic Survey.Hughes-Warrrington, Marnie Fifty Key Thinkers on History, London: Routledge, 2000 page 234 In 1957, Moody gave a second series of lectures on Northern Ireland Radio, which again published as Ulster Since 1800, Second Series: a Social Survey.Hughes- Warrrington, Marnie Fifty Key Thinkers on History, London: Routlede, 2000 page 234 In 1967, Moody hosted the 21-part television series The Course of Irish History that was aired on the Raidió Teilifís Éireann (RTE), where he aimed \\"to present a survey of Irish history that would be both popular and authoritative, concise but comprehensive, highly selective while at the same time balanced and fair-minded, critical, but constructive and sympathetic\\".Hughes-Warrrington, Marnie Fifty Key Thinkers on History, London: Routledge, 2000 page 234 Moody served on the Irish Manuscripts Commission (1943–1984), the Irish Broadcasting Council (1953–1960), the advisory committee for cultural relations to the Irish government (1949–1963), the commission on higher education (1960–1962) and the Irish Broadcasting Authority (1960–1972).Hughes-Warrrington, Marnie Fifty Key Thinkers on History, London: Routledge, 2000 page 234 In 1962, Moody in a presidential speech before the Irish Historical Society called for a “New History of Ireland” that would take the form of a 12–14 volume work that would cover all aspects of the political, economic, cultural, social, legal, religious and military history of Ireland that would require the collaboration of dozens of scholars with financial support from the Irish state.Hughes-Warrrington, Marnie Fifty Key Thinkers on History, London: Routlede, 2000 page 235 In October 1963, Moody secured the necessary funding for “Moody’s history” as the project was popularly dubbed.Hughes-Warrrington, Marnie Fifty Key Thinkers on History, London: Routlede, 2000 page 235 However, Moody was forced to modify his plans for The New History of Ireland with the first stage to consist of two volumes giving a general overview of Irish history with the remaining ten volumes to consist of “primary narrative” and “complementary structure” with specialised chapters on subjects such as the history of the law, music, literature and art in Ireland.Hughes-Warrrington, Marnie Fifty Key Thinkers on History, London: Routlede, 2000 page 236 In 1972, the Irish government fired the entire council of the Irish Broadcasting Authority for supposedly violating a directive to not air “any matter that could be calculated to promote the aims or activities of any organisation which engages in, promote, encourages or advocates the attaining of any particular objective by violent means.”Hughes-Warrrington, Marnie Fifty Key Thinkers on History, London: Routlede, 2000 pages 234–235 Moody was broadly supportive of the directive, but felt it had been applied in a heavy-handed manner that was constricting the supply of information.Hughes-Warrrington, Marnie Fifty Key Thinkers on History, London: Routlede, 2000 page 235 At the time of his firing, Moody told the Irish Times on 27 November 1972: > “Much of our problems springs from a refusal to face unpalatable facts, an > addiction to make believe, a tendency to prefer myths to the truth. But a > new realism, a new questioning of case-hardened assumptions has emerged, and > this has been greatly, perhaps decisively, encouraged and stimulated by the > development of broadcasting. If the measure of freedom that the RTE has had > is now to be drastically reduced, one of the first casualties will be the > truth, and the process of awakening the public mind to the realities of the > Irish predicament may be disastrously halted. We need more, not less, > communication in Ireland”.Hughes-Warrrington, Marnie Fifty Key Thinkers on > History, London: Routlede, 2000 page 235 In 1976, the first volume of The New History of Ireland dealing with Irish history from 1543 to 1691 was published under the editorship of Moody, Father F. X. Martin and Francis John Byrne.Hughes-Warrrington, Marnie Fifty Key Thinkers on History, London: Routledge, 2000 page 236 The project has marred by major delays, but the critical reception to The New History of Ireland has been very favourable.Hughes-Warrrington, Marnie Fifty Key Thinkers on History, London: Routledge, 2000 page 236 In 1974, Moody published The Ulster Question, 1603–1973 detailing with the troubled relationship between the Catholic community who tended to be Irish nationalists and the Protestant community who tended to be Unionists in Ulster.Hughes-Warrrington, Marnie Fifty Key Thinkers on History, London: Routledge, 2000 page 236 As someone from Northern Ireland living in the Irish republic, Moody was greatly concerned with and saddened by “the troubles” that broke out in Northern Ireland in 1968 as the state of low- level warfare was popularly known, and in his preface written in January 1974, Moody expressed the hope that the power-sharing deal reached in the Sunningdale Agreement would end \\"the troubles\\".Hughes-Warrrington, Marnie Fifty Key Thinkers on History, London: Routledge, 2000 page 236 By the time the book was published later that year, the Sunningdale Agreement had already collapsed.Hughes-Warrrington, Marnie Fifty Key Thinkers on History, London: Routledge, 2000 page 236 In the 1970s, Moody started researching the life of Michael Davitt, who founded the Irish Land League and published a biography Davitt and the Irish Revolution, 1846–82 in 1981.Hughes-Warrrington, Marnie Fifty Key Thinkers on History, London: Routledge, 2000 page 235 In a 1977 speech Irish History and Irish Mythology, Moody called for historians to end the promoting of what Moody called the “myths”, or “received views” which mix “fact and fiction”, which Moody argued was causing the violence in Northern Ireland.Hughes-Warrrington, Marnie Fifty Key Thinkers on History, London: Routledge, 2000 page 236 Moody labelled as “myths” the popular views about the establishment of the Anglican Church of Ireland, the view that Catholicism was the driving force behind the resistance to the Elizabethan conquest of Ireland, the 1641 uprising against the English Crown, the idea of “true” Irishmen as a Catholic “race”, the Great Famine of Ireland of 1845–50, the “land war” of 1879–82, and what Moody called the most pernicious “myth” of them all, the idea of Irish history as one of a continuous struggle for freedom from Great Britain.Hughes-Warrrington, Marnie Fifty Key Thinkers on History, London: Routledge, 2000 page 236 Moody argued this “myth” of Irish history that depicted in Manichean terms the entirety of Irish history from 1169 to the present as a struggle between the morally pure Irish vs. the utterly evil British was being used by the Provisional Irish Republican Army as the main reason for its struggle in Northern Ireland, and ruled out any possibility of a compromise solution to \\"the troubles\\" of Northern Ireland.Hughes-Warrrington, Marnie Fifty Key Thinkers on History, London: Routledge, 2000 page 236 Moody argued that many Irish historians distort the struggle against Queen Elizabeth I's efforts for the conquest and colonisation of Ireland by treating the resistance as entirely Gaelic-speaking and Catholic, which ignored the role of the \\"Old English\\" community in Ireland, who were also Catholic, spoke English, and were willing to be loyal to the Crown provided the Crown respected their traditional privileges in Ireland, which it was not under Elizabeth.Moody, T.W. \\"Irish history and Irish mythology\\" pages 6–24 from Hermathena, No. 124, Summer 1978 page 8. Moody attacked the \\"Anglican\\" myth of Irish history that the Church of Ireland was the \\"true\\" church, a continuation of the church founded by Saint Patrick, which argued created a smug sense of Protestant superiority to the Catholic population that was used to justify \\"the Ascendancy\\" in Ireland.Moody, T.W. \\"Irish history and Irish mythology\\" pages 6–24 from Hermathena, No. 124, Summer 1978 page 9. Moody stated about the Irish Rebellion of 1641 that were indeed massacres of Protestant settlers from England and Scotland by the Catholic Irish who resented being pushed off their land to make way for the Anglo-Scottish colonists, but that the numbers of dead were vastly exaggerated with some contemporary pamphlets claiming about 200, 000 massacred while the real number appears to be about 4, 000 killed.Moody, T.W. \\"Irish history and Irish mythology\\" pages 6–24 from Hermathena, No. 124, Summer 1978 page 10. Moody further argued the claim there was a genocidal plan by the Irish elite to exterminate all of the Protestant settlers has no basis in fact, and the massacres were spontaneous explosions of hate.Moody, T.W. \\"Irish history and Irish mythology\\" pages 6–24 from Hermathena, No. 124, Summer 1978 page 10. Moody argued that the \\"myth\\" of the 1641 uprising had been, and was still being used by the Protestant community of Northern Ireland (who are the descendants of the Anglo-Scottish settlers) to portray the \\"wickedness and savagery\\" of all Irish Catholics who were allegedly intent upon the slaughter of Protestants at the first opportunity.Moody, T.W. \\"Irish history and Irish mythology\\" pages 6–24 from Hermathena, No. 124, Summer 1978 page 10. Moody stated the \\"myth\\" of the 1641 rebellion as a premeditated genocide organised by the Catholic Church that took hundreds of thousands of lives was being used to promote the \\"siege mentality\\" and sectarian hatred that was hindering peace efforts in Northern Ireland.Moody, T.W. \\"Irish history and Irish mythology\\" pages 6–24 from Hermathena, No. 124, Summer 1978 page 10. Moody attacked the \\"myth\\" of Orangism promoted by the Loyal Orange Order, which identified Catholicism with tyranny and Protestantism with freedom.Moody, T.W. \\"Irish history and Irish mythology\\" pages 6–24 from Hermathena, No. 124, Summer 1978 pages 11–12. Moody stated through William of Orange was indeed a Protestant, in the War of the Grand Alliance against France, his allies included the Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I and King Carlos II of Spain who were both Catholics, and argued the conflict was more of an Anglo-French war as William sought to resist the ambitions of King Louis XIV of France to dominate Europe rather than a Protestant-Catholic war as painted by the Loyal Orange Order.Moody, T.W. \\"Irish history and Irish mythology\\" pages 6–24 from Hermathena, No. 124, Summer 1978 page 12. Moody maintained the way the Loyal Orange Order used the \\"myth\\" of the Battle of the Boyne, turning a dynastic dispute into a struggle for freedom was a way of maintaining Protestant supremacy in Ireland.Moody, T.W. \\"Irish history and Irish mythology\\" pages 6–24 from Hermathena, No. 124, Summer 1978 pages 13–15. Likewise, Moody attacked the \\"myth\\" of a Protestant community that was solidly and unconditionally Unionist throughout the centuries, noting the Scottish settlers in Ulster resisted giving oaths of allegiance to King Charles I in 1639; that many of the leaders of the Society of United Irishmen were Protestant; and the ferocious denunciations of Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone by the Orange Order when he disestablished the Church of Ireland in 1869, which led to some Orange lodges to call for a repeal of the Union.Moody, T.W. \\"Irish history and Irish mythology\\" pages 6–24 from Hermathena, No. 124, Summer 1978 pages 15–16. Moody argued that the Unionism felt by most Irish Protestants was a \\"conditional\\" one, and noted in 1912–14 the Ulster Volunteers were prepared to fight the British to stay British.Moody, T.W. \\"Irish history and Irish mythology\\" pages 6–24 from Hermathena, No. 124, Summer 1978 pages 16–17. More recently, Moody noted that several Unionist groups, upset with measures by the British government, to end discrimination against the Catholic minority of Ulster, had been speaking of having Northern Ireland break away from the United Kingdom to form a new state that would guarantee Protestant supremacy, which Moody used to suggest again that most Unionists had only a \\"conditional\\" loyalty to the United Kingdom.Moody, T.W. \\"Irish history and Irish mythology\\" pages 6–24 from Hermathena, No. 124, Summer 1978 page 17. Moody was no less unsparing in his condemnation of nationalist \\"myths\\" than he was of Unionist \\"myths\\". Moody stated the nationalist thesis that Unionism in Ulster was merely something fabricated by the Crown and was not a real movement, is disapproved by the way that the Unionists had acted time after time to sabotage the efforts of the British government to come to terms with Irish nationalists, starting with the anti-Home Rule riot in Belfast in 1886 that killed 32 people to the present.Moody, T.W. \\"Irish history and Irish mythology\\" pages 6–24 from Hermathena, No. 124, Summer 1978 pages 16–17. Moody noted through the Ulster Volunteers in 1912–14 were encouraged by the leaders of the Conservative Party and the British Army to challenge the British government, the general strike by the Protestant working class in Northern Ireland in 1974 that ended the Sunningdale Agreement was clearly a mass movement directed against the efforts of the Crown to reach a compromise in Ulster.Moody, T.W. \\"Irish history and Irish mythology\\" pages 6–24 from Hermathena, No. 124, Summer 1978 page 17. Moody argued that the popular thesis that the Great Famine of Ireland of 1845–50 in which millions starved to death was deliberately planned by the British government as a part of a genocidal plot to wipe the Irish off the face of the earth is not true, arguing that the famine was the result of the social-economic system that existed in Ireland at the time.Moody, T.W. \\"Irish history and Irish mythology\\" pages 6–24 from Hermathena, No. 124, Summer 1978 page 18. Another nationalist \\"myth\\" that Moody attacked was the claim made during the \\"Land War\\" of 1879–81 that the Irish people had existed harmoniously on the land before the English conquest had imposed a \\"feudal\\" system on Ireland.Moody, T.W. \\"Irish history and Irish mythology\\" pages 6–24 from Hermathena, No. 124, Summer 1978 page 20. Moody argued that \\"land war\\" was due to combination of conditions peculiar to the late 1870s, instead of an explosion of long-running resentments as landlord-tenant relations were actually improving in the decade prior to the \\"land war\\"; the \\"Ascendancy\\" families who owned most of the land in Ireland were generally indifferent as opposed to oppressive landlords; and the claim that Ireland had no \\"feudalism\\" before 1169 was based on the mistranslation of various ancient Gaelic texts into English in the 19th century.Moody, T.W. \\"Irish history and Irish mythology\\" pages 6–24 from Hermathena, No. 124, Summer 1978 pages 20–21. Finally, Moody attacked the \\"predestine nation\\" myth of Irish history that portrayed Irish history as one long struggle for freedom from the British Crown over the course of the last 800 odd years, which he complained reduced everything down to an \\"unending war with Britain\\" and did not really address any of the social questions facing modern Ireland in the 20th century.Moody, T.W. \\"Irish history and Irish mythology\\" pages 6–24 from Hermathena, No. 124, Summer 1978 page 21. Moody argued that the mainstream Irish nationalists in the late 19th century wanted \\"home rule\\" (devolution of powers from the Westminster parliament to a new parliament in Dublin), not independence, as most people in Ireland did not wish to leave the United Kingdom.Moody, T.W. \\"Irish history and Irish mythology\\" pages 6–24 from Hermathena, No. 124, Summer 1978 page 21. Moody stated the Home Rule movement that was opposed to independence and republicanism dominated Irish nationalism until the First World War, and only a small minority wanted an independent republic.Moody, T.W. \\"Irish history and Irish mythology\\" pages 6–24 from Hermathena, No. 124, Summer 1978 page 21. Moody stated it was only the frustration caused by the inability of the government of Prime Minister H. H. Asquith to bring in home rule as he had promised in the face of opposition from Ulster unionists that led some Irish nationalists to turn to violence.Moody, T.W. \\"Irish history and Irish mythology\\" pages 6–24 from Hermathena, No. 124, Summer 1978 pages 21–22. Moody further argued the great sea-change in the public's views occurred between the Easter Rising in 1916 and the election of 1918, when Sinn Féin won the majority of seats outside of Ulster on a platform of winning independence and a republic by \\"any means necessary\\".Moody, T.W. \\"Irish history and Irish mythology\\" pages 6–24 from Hermathena, No. 124, Summer 1978 page 21. Moody argued this \\"myth\\" of Irish history that Ireland will not be \\"redeemed\\" until all of Ireland is reunited, no matter what the cost in blood, was used to justify all of the IRA's violence and mayhem, who claimed to be acting in the name of the entire Irish nation, even through they had no mandate to do so.Moody, T.W. \\"Irish history and Irish mythology\\" pages 6–24 from Hermathena, No. 124, Summer 1978 page 22. Moody argued the \\"predestine nation myth\\" used by the IRA simply ignored the Unionism felt by the much of the Protestant community in Northern Ireland as it was based on the assumption that if only the British Army withdrew from Northern Ireland, then the Protestants of Ulster would all happily join the Republic of Ireland.Moody, T.W. \\"Irish history and Irish mythology\\" pages 6–24 from Hermathena, No. 124, Summer 1978 page 22. Moody ended his speech by remarking: \\"History is a matter of facing the facts of Irish history, however painful some of them may be, mythology is a way of refusing to face the facts. The study of history not only enlarges truth about our past, but opens the mind to ever new accessions of truth. On the other hand, the obsession with myths, and especially the more destructive myths, perpetuates the closed mind\\".Moody, T.W. \\"Irish history and Irish mythology\\" pages 6–24 from Hermathena, No. 124, Summer 1978 page 24. Moody's speech generated immense controversy, which continues to this day.Hughes- Warrrington, Marnie Fifty Key Thinkers on History, London: Routlede, 2000 page 237 A number of Irish historians such as John A. Murphy, Tom Dunne, Michael Laffan, F. S. L. Lyons, Ronan Fanning, and Steven Ellis welcomed Moodys' speech as a long overdue call for a less nationalistic interpretation of Irish history.Hughes-Warrrington, Marnie Fifty Key Thinkers on History, London: Routledge, 2000 page 237 Moody's leading critics were Brendan Bradshaw and Desmond Fennell who accused him of essentially white-washing the history of British rule in Ireland.Hughes-Warrrington, Marnie Fifty Key Thinkers on History, London: Routledge, 2000 page 237 Bradshaw wrote at best, Moody was simply naïve, and his call for a more objective history served to sanitise readers to the injustices and suffering bore by the Irish people during the long rule of the Crown.Hughes-Warrrington, Marnie Fifty Key Thinkers on History, London: Routledge, 2000 page 237 Bradshaw also accused Moody of denigrating Irish nationalism, which served to not only downplay the wrongs suffered by the Irish people, but to disparage those who fought against British rule and their achievements in finally winning Irish independence in 1922.Hughes-Warrrington, Marnie Fifty Key Thinkers on History, London: Routledge, 2000 page 237 Fennell accused Moody of writing history to “meet the needs of the establishment”, and claimed the idea that the Irish history was a long struggle for freedom from the British was not a “myth”, but a fact that Moody was attempting to suppress.Hughes-Warrrington, Marnie Fifty Key Thinkers on History, London: Routledge, 2000 page 237 The Australian historian Marnie Hughes-Warrington wrote the claim that Moody \\"…hoped to bring a about a revolution simply to denigrate the claims of Irish nationalists is not true\\".Hughes-Warrrington, Marnie Fifty Key Thinkers on History, London: Routlede, 2000 page 237 Hughes-Warrington stated that Moody was aware that the present always influenced one's evaluation of the past and she argued that he was attempting to do was find a way to look at the past that was objective and to understand Irish history on its own terms.Hughes-Warrrington, Marnie Fifty Key Thinkers on History, London: Routledge, 2000 page 238 In this regard, Hughes-Warrington maintained that Moody “…looked to science, which was seen to provide methods which could combat personal bias and render historical interpretations subject to external assessment and evaluation”, comparing Moody to the historians who take a “functionalist” line on Nazi Germany and the “Final Solution”, American historians who argued for giving slavery and racism a greater prominence in the teaching of American history, the “revisionist” historians of the French revolution and those historians who argue for a greater place in women in history.Hughes-Warrrington, Marnie Fifty Key Thinkers on History, London: Routledge, 2000 page 238  References  *Mulvey H.

Unlike other County Court centres the CCBC does not physically hear cases. If any case might require a hearing it is transferred to another centre.  Creation  The increasing ubiquity of computers and Internet access led to public discussion of allowing greater use of information technology to run court proceedings. In January 1990 the Claim Production Centre (CPC) (originally called the Summons Production Centre) was created, with the power to issue and serve claims through information technology. This is currently enshrined within Rule 7.10 of the Civil Procedure Rules 1998 (CPR). This states that \\"…there shall be a Production Centre for the issue of claim forms and other related matters…\\" and that the relevant practice direction makes provision for its use and any modification or disapplication of the CPR. All claims issued through the CPC were originally issued in the name of a county court in the same way as claims issued in the traditional manner. In March 1992 the CCBC was created to remove the burden of routine matters in simple CPC cases from the other county court. The current definition of such matters is contained in Practice Direction 7C.  Location  Currently both the CPC and CCBC are located in Northampton.  Access  Use of the CCBC is available only to members. Membership is free and is available to anyone who successfully demonstrates they can meet the IT requirements of the CCBC. Continued use of the CCBC is subject to the Rules of Membership and Code of Conduct.  Use  Cases can be issued through the CCBC in two different ways.  Money Claim Online  Money Claim Online (MCOL) was created in February 2002. It provides users who wish to issue a limited number of claims to commence and manage County Court proceedings using a website, and to pay court fees online using a credit card.  Bulk issue  Instead of submitting an individual claim form along with an individual payment of the correct fee for each case, CCBC users submit a single file containing each of the claims they wish to issue on a particular day as a data record in a specified format. Fees for all of these cases can be paid in a lump sum. Files are submitted electronically in XML format via a secure API gateway using a system known as Secure Data Transfer (SDT), developed under contract to Her Majesty's Courts and Tribunals Service in 2013 by a third party supplier. Previously files could be submitted on floppy disk or magnetic tape. For this reason long-standing users of the CCBC may still refer to the data file as the \\"tape\\". In 2012 a secure email transfer system was implemented as an interim measure until the new SDT system was completed. Once this was done the secure email transfer option was removed. CCBC users may poll the SDT API to request updates on the status of their cases. Depending on the nature of the original request some information (i.e. basic validation) may be available within a few minutes of data having been uploaded, whilst other information may not be available until the request has been fully processed by the Court Service internal systems - this can take 24 hours or longer. As well as issuing claim forms, the CCBC also handles requests for judgments and warrants of execution in the same manner.  Defendant responses  Claim forms issued by the CCBC are served upon the defendant(s) in the same manner as other courts. However, the response pack also includes a password to allow the defendant to file their response via a website. Where the defendant contests some, or all, of the claim, the claimant is required (if they wish to continue) to request the case be transferred out of the CCBC.  Limitations  Rule 7 allows for limits to be placed on the types of claim that may be issued via the CCBC. These are currently: * The claim must be for issue in the County Court and not the High Court; * The claim form cannot refer to separate particulars of claim; * The claim must be for a specified sum of money less than £100,000 sterling, and expressed in sterling; * The claim cannot be against more than two Defendants; * Where there are two defendants the claim against each of them must be for the same amount; * The defendants must not be a child or patient (within the meaning of Rule 21 of the Civil Procedure Rules) or a legally assisted person (within the meaning of the Legal Aid Act 1988); * The defendant cannot be the Crown; * The defendants' address for service must be within England or Wales. In addition the CCBC cannot be used to issue claims under Part 8 of the CPR.

The sundial originally in the Giffen castle garden was sold and was moved eventually to Crummock house, Beith, now demolished. In 1959 the sundial was reported to be located at Craigbet, Renfrewshire.Ayrshire Archaeological & Natural History Collections. V.6. 1958-1960. p.248 This sundial had its horizontal plane divided by volutes, between which a lion's head alternates with a rose; it was made in 1719 and repaired in 1810. Local farmhouses were built using stone from the front wall of the castle, which was consequently entirely removed. Above the entrance, with its strong iron door,Jamieson, Sheila (1997). Our Village. Greenhills Women's Rural Institute. p. 13 there had been a carving of a man shooting with a crossbow at what has been called a wild boar. It is not unlikely that this commemorates a feat of bold hunting by a member of the family of Giffen. A similar carving at Linton parish church commemorates just such a feat, for which William the Lion knighted the bowman and bestowed upon him the lands and barony of Linton. In 1837 the castle's south wall fellJamieson, Sheila (1997). Our Village. Greenhills Women's Rural Institute. p. 12 and finally on 12 April 1838, during the silence of the night, the north and east walls of the old castle fell leaving little more than a disorderly heap of stones. The adjacent Mains of Giffen farm had been feued by Anstruther to Robert Craig in 1726. John King of 'Giffin Miln' built his house using stone from the castle and this is probably how the old carvings came to be incorporated into the walls of this building. The doorjambs are also said to have come from the old castle. Thomas Craig, grandson of Robert, passed on the feu to Thomas White in 1816, during whose possession the castle met its final fall, inspiring the following indignant poem by James Wilson, the local poet: { cellpadding=10 border=\\"0\\" align=center -  bgcolor=#f4f4f4 \\"Hard-hearted misers worship dust, Their covetous mind is little worth, Secured in chains for mammon's curse, The older they grow worse and worse!\\" } Giffen castle in the 1800s with what is probably the old Giffen Farm, just visible to the left-hand sidePaterson, James (1863–66).

In August 1956 the OS reported that the remains of Giffen Castle now consist of three fragments of rubble masonry, the largest portion measuring 4.0 m long by 2.0 m thick and 1.9 m high. The remainder of the castle was demolished in about 1920 when the adjoining quarry was dug. In June 1983 the OS visited the site again and stated that there are no remains of the castle in situ. The three fragments of masonry are in fact large tumbled blocks, and together with a mass of loose shaped stone, also from the castle, form a garden rockery. A marriage stone lintel above the doorway of the adjacent Mains house is inscribed RC MC 1758. This appears contemporaneous to the single-storey house and of doubtful association with the old castle. Mr. Robert King, the farmer of the lands near Giffen castle, reported in the 1890s that when digging drains to the north-east of the castle he came across a large number of bones, which tradition says were there as a result of a battle fought by the lord of the castle, his retainers and an attacking party. The bones were in a hollow to the west of the castle, and between it and the high ground on which the castle and hamlet of Giffen stood.Smith, John (1895). Prehistoric Man in Ayrshire. Pub. Elliot Stock. P. 83. Metal detectorists found a number of musket-balls in this area.

In 1861 his grandnephew, Henry Gardiner Patrick, son of John Shedden Patrick of Trearne and Woodside, succeeded to the property and built a large and handsome mansion-house in the Scottish Baronial style on the lands of Bankhead farm, a little over two miles (3 km) from the old Castle of Giffen.Dobie, James (1876).

The nephew sold the estate, which extended to about 885½ acres, chiefly arable and enclosed land, but it included about 54½ acres of woodland and wooded policies (grounds). It contained 4 public rooms, 6 family bedrooms, 3 dressing rooms, day and night nurseries, bathroom, 6 servants' bedrooms, and ample kitchen and domestic accommodation making 35 rooms in all. The offices included excellent stabling, garage, lodge, and coachman's house. The Castletoun of Giffen General Roy's survey of 1747-55 spells the name as 'Giffin' and indicates a cluster of buildings, a hamlet, on the southern side of the castle. The Chapels and the Chapel Well The chapel and well lay near to Giffen Castle according to John Smith,Smith, John (1895). Prehistoric Man in Ayrshire. Pub. Elliot Stock. however another chapel and well dedicated to St. Bridget existed at Trearne on a low hill, with an associated burial ground and a nook in which was set a carving of two figures, possibly a cat and a rabbit, measuring by .Reflections on Beith and District.

The quarry workers started coming across graves as they worked closer to the chapel and oddly the bodies were found buried face down.Porterfield, S. (1925). Rambles Round Beith. Beith: Pilot Press. Page 21. In the 12th century, the Laird, William de Nenham had granted land to the monastery of Dryburgh and a chapel was built to the south- east of the castle, possibly next to the well which is still marked on the 2001 OS map, known locally as the Chapel Well.Dobie, James (1876). Pont's Cunninghame topographized 1604–1608 with continuations and illustrative notices (1876). Pub. John Tweed. p. 377. William's son Richard granted more land at this site, however his brother Alexander inherited and wished for his chapel to be held by the monastery of Kilwinning and not Dryburgh. To achieve this end he gave land for a site at Trearne, next to St. Bridget's chapel which had previously been granted to the Monks of Dryburgh. The Barony chapel at Trearne was for the souls of Richard de Morville, William de Morville, Roland of Galloway, Elen de Morville and of their heirs, as well as that of Walter de Mulcaster, his ancestors and his successors. The chapel at Giffen was likely to have been for the same overlords or superiors, but also for Alexander de Nenham, his ancestors and his successors. This situation of excambied or exchanged lands has led to some confusion in that three chapels appear to have existed at one time within the Lordship of Giffen, not two as is usually stated.Paterson, James (1863–66). History of the Counties of Ayr and Wigton. V. - III - Cunninghame. J. Stillie. Edinburgh. p. 65.

Alexander gave to the monastery of Dryburgh which had a chapel and a well to St. Bridget, previously founded by the monastery of Kilwinning, the ruins of which were still to be seen, together with a burial ground. Note that Paterson's version (1866) is at odds with Dobie's (1876) account. The De Morvilles were supporters of John Baliol and upon the succession of Robert the Bruce to the Crown of Scotland they were dispossessed and Giffen reverted to the crown. Sir Hugh de Eglinton married Egidia, sister of Robert II and was given the Lordship in 1370.Millar, A.H. (1885) The Castles and Mansions of Ayrshire. Reprinted by The Grimsay Press. 2000. . pp. 84 - 85. Giffen then remained in the Montgomerie family for several centuries. The barony seems to have been more or less consistently passed to the Master or heir of Eglinton for many years, however in 1505 the first Earl took the barony into his personal care. After this time the barony passed back and forth amongst the family when cadet lines failed to produce issue. The 1764 coat of arms of the Montgomeries, Earls of Eglinton Sir Robert Montgomerie, son of Sir John de Montgomerie of Ardrossan, Baron of Parliament, had been the first Montgomerie of Giffen in around 1400. By charter, dated 9 March 1413, the Regent Albany confirmed the grants made by Sir John of Montgomerie of Ardrossan, Knight, to Robert, his son, of the lordship of Giffen in Kyle Stewart.Montgomerie genealogy Various sons inherited and in 1560 Patrick Montgomerie was a member of the Great Parliament which established the Protestant faith in Scotland. He was later banished for a time because of his reformation principles and was succeeded by a daughter who married John Montgomerie of Scotstoun and inherited part of the Giffen lands. Being without further issue the Eglinton Montgomerie's, in the person of the Hon. Robert, brother to Hugh, the murdered 4th Earl, inherited the barony, producing an heiress, Margaret. He is said incidentally to have \\"honourably revenged\\" his brother's death, killing John Cunninghame of Clonbeith at Hamilton Palace.Ker, Rev. William Lee (1900) Kilwinnning. Pub. A.W. Cross, Kilwinning. P. 161. Margaret married twice, but had no issue and the barony again reverted to the Eglinton branch. Graysteel was the appellation given to Sir Henry Montgomerie of Giffen (due to his dexterity with the sword) who inherited, however he had no issue and once again the barony reverted, as his wife sold the barony of Giffen to her father-in-law for an annuity of 2,500 merks.Robertson, William (1908). Ayrshire. Its History and Historic Families. Vols. 2. Pub. Ayr. P. 72. Henry had been born in 1614 and Anne of Denmark, James VI's Queen, stood as his godmother. The direct Montgomerie line ended with the 5th. Earl who had married his cousin-german, Margaret, eldest daughter and heiress of Robert Montgomerie of Giffen and Master of Eglinton. Their marriage was so unsuccessful that the Earl took the drastic step of revoking her heritable rights as gained through their marriage.Robertson, William (1908). Ayrshire.

Sunday Mail. Vol. 4, Part 44. P. 1232 The seventh Earl's second son, The Right Hon. Francis inherited and lived an eventful life. He was one of the Lords of the Privy Council, and a Commissioner of the Treasury, in the reign of William III and Queen Anne. He was appointed in 1706 as one of the Commissioners for Scotland for the Treaty of Union. Francis acquired the estate of Hessilhead and built an addition to the old tower as well as slating the roof, making it one of the finest properties in the district on behalf of his eldest son, Lieut.-Colonel John Montgomerie of Giffen, whilst continuing to live at Giffen for the remainder of his life. Beith Auld kirk Henry married a granddaughter of Alexander Leslie, Earl of Leven the favourite General of Gustavus Adolphus, King of Sweden. She died in her prime and a certain highly valuable jewel, given to her grandfather by the Swedish king and which was to be passed only through her family came into the possession of Henry. The 6th Earl of Leven instigated legal proceedings which eventually saw the jewel returned to the Leslie family.Dobie, James (1876). Pont's Cunninghame topographized 1604–1608 with continuations and illustrative notices (1876). Pub. John Tweed. P. 147 - 148. In 1697 Francis was made one of the commissioners looking into witchcraft following the Christian Shaw case. Five out of 24 accused persons were burned at the stake. The Act of Union was very unpopular in some quarters. A song of 1706 on the Union reads:- { cellpadding=10 border=\\"0\\" align=center -  bgcolor=#f4f4f4 \\"There's Roseberry, Glasgow, and Dupplin, And Lord Archibald Campbell and Ross, The President, Francis Montgomery, Wha ambles liked any paced horse.\\" } In another, called \\"Lines upon the Rogues in Parliament\\", is the following stanza:- { cellpadding=10 border=\\"0\\" align=center -  bgcolor=#f4f4f4 \\"Thou Francis of Giffen thou's bigot as hell, And Brodie in nonsense in this doth excell, For rebellion engrained you may each bear the bell, Wherefore sin on and be damned.\\" } Image:Giffen aisle at Beith Auld Kirk.JPGThe old Giffen aisle at Beith Auld Kirk File:Giffen aisle doorway.JPGThe blocked up Giffen Aisle doorway File:Giffen aisle, Beith, Ayrshire.JPGThe old church end of the aisle Upon the death in October 1709 of George Allardyce, Master of the Scottish Mint, John was appointed to the post. He went on to become the MP for Ayr at the 1710 General election, and became one of the Gentleman of the bedchamber to George II, when Prince of Wales. John Montgomerie seems to have been totally uninterested in the affairs of the mint and his personal finances were in some disarray. He at one point proposed an exchange of his post at the mint for a commission in the Foot Guards and ended up with both. He fought in the war against France and was at the disastrous battle of Almanza in Spain. In June 1717 he assigned his salary to a third party, having withdrawn from any active involvement. In 1727 he was appointed as Governor of New York, where he remained until his death on 1 July 1731.Murray, Athol L. (1999). The Scottish Mint after the recoinage, 1709–1836. PSAS, 129, P. 861 - 886. He had a daughter Elizabeth, and upon his death the line of the Montgomerie of Giffen became extinct. He had been forced to sell his estates and it was Sir John Anstruther of the Balcaskie family, who purchased Giffen in 1722, under the burden of liferent as Francis was still living. As Fullarton puts it the large and valuable estate of Giffen, is now broken down into a multitude of inglorious fragments, with scarcely a possibility of its ever again being restored and cemented into its original dignity and beneficial condition.Fullarton, John (1864).

Loch Brand near Gateside was once the property of the monks of Kilwinning Abbey and it is recorded that in 1482 the monks took legal action against the Montgomeries of Giffin Castle and James Ker who were accused of dangerous destruction and down-casting of the fosses and dikes of the loch called Loch Brand.Dobie, James D.

The Darien Affair The Darien Scheme was an attempt by the Scots, led by William Paterson (the founder of the Bank of England), in the 1690s to set up a trading colony in Central America in the late 1690s, however the opposition from England and elsewhere was so great that the attempt failed with huge losses and great financial implications for the country and for individuals. Half of the whole circulating capital of Scotland was subscribed and mostly lost, although the Act of Union in 1707 made provision for a degree of compensation to be paid to the Darien subscribers. In Cunninghame some examples of losses are Frances Montgomerie of Giffin (£1000), Major James Cunninghame of Aiket (£200), Sir William Cunninghame of Cunninghamhead (£1000), and James Thomson of Hill in Kilmaurs (£100). In modern terms a thousand pounds loss in the 17th century must have been a devastating blow to the family finances.  Giffen Mill  William Aiton's 1811 map showing Giffin The old feudal or barony mill, also known as Barmill, Barrmill or Baroil is at Map reference: NS 3699 5133. The remains visible today are early 19th-century, probably rebuilt on an old site, when grain prices were driven up by the Napoleonic Wars. The external stair led to the kiln for drying the corn before it was ground.Giffen Mill. Accessed: 2009-11-19 It was a three-storey, four-bay rubble building on a rectangular plan, now gutted and the upper part used as a store until recently. A small dovecot was located in the upper angle of the gable end above the miller's house yard. The mid-18th century substantial miller's house is still occupied and is in good condition. On General Roy's survey of 1747 - 55 Giffin Mill is present with a cluster of buildings nearby. The mill pond and lade are clearly marked on the 1858 OS map and a sand pit is marked nearby. The 1923 - 4 the OS map no longer marks the mill or its lade and mill pond. The machinery was adapted to drive a saw mill before final closure. Giffen would have been the thirled mill of the barony, thirlage being the feudal law by which the laird (lord) of Giffen could force all those vassals or suckeners living on his lands to bring their grain to his mill to be ground. Additionally the suckeners had to carry out repairs on the mill, maintain the lade and weir as well as conveying new millstones to the site.Gauldie, Enid (1981). The Scottish Miller 1700–1900. Pub. John Donald. .Ferguson, Robert (2005). A Miller's Tale. The Life and Times of Dalgarven Mill. . Under thirlage the suckeners had to convey new millstones to their thirled mill, sometimes over significant distances, in this case they probably came from West Kilbride. The width of some of the first roads was determined by the requirement to have at least two people on either side of a new grindstone being transported, with a wooden axle called a 'mill-wand' passed through the hole in the centre. As has already been mentioned, the miller's house had two carved stones from Giffen Castle built into its walls and a further one built into the gable end wall of the mill itself. In 2006 / 2007 the miller's house was renovated, however the other carved stones were not found during the re-roughcasting; they had been on the front.Porterfield, S. (1925). Rambles Round Beith. P. 36. The grandfather of the present owner had the stones chipped off; they were located either side of the main entrance door.

Yesterdays Beith, a pictorial guide. Beith: DoE Award Scheme. p. 117 A smithy stood at the crossroads on the Borestone farm side of the hamlet. This hamlet is named after the artificial mound, a Moot, Law or Justice hill that once stood here. The Moot or Justice hill This artificial mound or moot hill was the site where proclamations of the Giffen Castle Baronial Court's judgements were made. For serious crimes the men were hung here and women were drowned a pit which would have been nearby. This situation, known as the feudal Barony right of 'pit and gallows' existed at many other sites, such as at Beith, Kilmarnock, Aiket, Ardrossan, and Dalry. Often the mounds were wooded and a Dule Tree may have been used as the gallows. Brehons or Judges administered justice from 'Court Hills', especially in the highlands. Auchenmade had a Law hill mound nearby, possibly destroyed by the railway. The 'Green hill' stood near to Greenhill farm.Dobie, James (1876). Pont's Cunninghame topographized 1604–1608 with continuations and illustrative notices (1876). Pub. John Tweed. P.163. No sign of the moot hill seems to survive, however a bridge near to Greenhill is marked as 'Tappethillock', meaning a flat-topped hillock, which may refer to it. Borestone farm and the Bore stane Borestone Farm from Greenhills lane In 1876 Dobie recorded that the Bore Stone or Stane was a large sandstone about 11½ inches in diameter, situated on the farm of Borestone to which it gave name (Name Book 1856). It had a circular opening in which it is said the flagstaff of the lordship or barony used to be erected when vassals from the neighbourhood were summoned to battle; at this position it would have been visible to all parts of the barony and beyond. but it is more likely to be a natural cavity caused by weathering. The farmer, Mr Craig, was not sure in 1895 if the stone was genuine, we will never know as the Bore Stone was broken up in about 1950 according to Mrs Raeside of Borestone Farm. It was at map reference: NS 3742 5054.Love, Dane (2009). Legendary Ayrshire. Custom: Folklore: Tradition.

It remained in that family until at least 1876. James Wilson of Thirdpart was a notable local eccentric who wrote and published poems on such topics as the 'Trearne Cattle Shows', the 'Fall of Giffin Castle' and the 'Misfortunes of a clocking-hen'. James died in 1838.Dobie, James (1876). Pont's Cunninghame topographized 1604–1608 with continuations and illustrative notices (1876). Pub. John Tweed. P. 376. William Wilson who lived here in 1837 was a brick and tile maker. A small mansion had been present here, occupied in the 1570s by John Montgomerie of Scotstoun, a near relative of the Laird of Hessilhead.Dobie, James (1876). Pont's Cunninghame topographized 1604–1608 with continuations and illustrative notices (1876). Pub. John Tweed. P. 196. Thirdpart Farm from Bank of Giffen Hessilhead (Hasil head) castle in 1876 A dreadful series of incidents occurred in the locality, starting on 19 July 1576 when the Lady of Hessilhead slapped one Robert Kent, servant to Gabriel, brother of John Montgomerie, for some grave offence given. The servant complained to his master and Gabriel went to his brother at the old Thirdpart mansion for advice. John advised him to seek revenge and therefore the next morning Gabriel and Robert gained entry into Hessilhead castle where they found the lady alone, upon which they grabbed her by the hair, pulled her onto the floor, kicked her in the bowels, and bruised her shamefully. Gabriel intended to shoot the Laird, however the whole household was now awake and the two only just managed to escape by stealing a horse and locking the castle gate from the outside. The Laird, Hew Montgomerie, hastened to Thirdpart where John and Gabriel came out with pistols and drawn swords and attacked Hew Montgomerie, injuring him on various parts of his body and leaving him for dead. He was rescued by some neighbours who took him to Hessilhead castle where he recovered from his wounds. Soon afterwards Hessilhead men, including one named Giffen, killed Gabriel after setting up an ambush for him. On 26 August John, Kent and another brother, Walter, went to try to kill the Laird, but could not find him. Amazingly the results of the various court cases was that no one was found guilty of any of the offences, most likely because honour had been satisfied on both sides.Dobie, James (1876).

Bank of Giffen Greenhills from Bank of Giffen Bank of Giffen Farm ruins In 1858 a farm known as 'Bank of Giffen' stood below the whinstone ridge which is close to what is now the old railway line across the road from Thirdpart farm; it is shown as abandoned in 1911. General Roy's map of 1747 - 55 marks its as 'Bank' only. Some ruins of the farm are still visible today (2007). A Ley tunnel is said to run from Bank of Giffen to Giffen Castle; some years back a couple of children are said to have found he tunnel and safely made their way through. Nettlehirst House and estate Nettlehirst was a fine mansion, also known as 'Nettlehurst', a castle-like structure overlooking the old Giffen Station and Dusk Water on the high ground above the limekilns. The Burns family built Nettlehirst House in 1844. William Burns became a toy-maker.Jamieson, Sheila (1997). Our Village. Greenhills Women's Rural Institute. p. 15 In July 1932 the house burned down, possibly due to an electrical fire. The dramatic fire coincided with the return from South Beach by a special train of Barrmill Sunday School trip on the line from Ardrossan to Giffen Station. The fierce fire was clearly visible from the train and it was a talking point in the village for months. The mansion house was never restored and shortly afterwards the dangerous ruin was demolished. The unusual entrance gatepiers, apple and pear orchard, boundary walls, mausoleum, farm and the stables, with its crow stepped gable ends and an 1811 marriage stone remain. The platform of the old tennis court is still apparent.Barmill history The OS Map shows a family burial ground located near woodland to the south of the old house site.

The origin of the placename itself is unknown, however the 'Nettle' may refer to the plant and 'Hurst' may refer to harvest; meaning an area where nettles predominate. The term 'hairst' might refer to a barren hillock, knoll, or ridge. A fitting description of the site today.  Barrmill  Drumbuie House, a property in the Barony of Giffen Nettlehirst Farm in 2009 General Roy's survey of 1747 - 55 shows only the farm of High Barr. A village grew up here due to the employment provided by the several limestone quarries that were present at one time, the Dockra Ironstone pit that was located near the railway line down from Dockra quarry in 1912, and other local industries. The village (co- ordinates 55 43' 45.2 N  04 36' 3.8 W) that developed had a population of 300 in 1876 and 600 in 1951, when the threadmaking industry had just ceased, although the workers still lived in company houses and were transported daily to the threadmaking factory at Kilbirnie. The limestone works was still active, but it too closed in 1972. The whinstone quarries of Messrs. King & Co. employed a considerable number of men in 1951, but even then the quarries were almost worked out.Strawhorn, John and Boyd, William (1951). The Third Statistical Account of Scotland. Ayrshire. Pub. P. 407. Giffen coal pit (No 1) lay close to Bankhead Moss as shown on the 1897 OS map, closing not long afterwards as the following OS maps cease showing it. The 1912 OS map marks the quoiting ground which was located in what is now the park, close to the old railway embankment; a mission hall is also shown, located just the other side of the railway bridge over the Beith branchline. In 2006 a new housing estate was created on the site of the old Barrmill railway station and goods yard. The local railways The Gree Viaduct in 2007, now demolished, on the former line between Lugton and Giffen At NS 356 5111 was Giffenmill Viaduct, opened 1903 by the Lanarkshire and Ayrshire Railway. A 7-span viaduct, with semi-circular concrete arches, it became disused in 1950 and was demolished in 2006. It was also known as the Barr Mill or Dusk Water viaduct. The nearby Gree Viaduct stood until its demolition in early 2008. The local station opened on 3 September 1888 and was known as Kilbirnie Junction, however it was renamed Giffen on 1 October 1889.Butt, R. V. J. (1995). The Directory of Railway Stations. Patrick Stephens Ltd, Sparkford. Giffen closed in 1932, but it had three platforms, a small station building, and at one point at least seven members of staff. The platforms still survive (2007), but the line running through the station serving DMC Beith is no longer in use (2007). Barrmill railway station served the village of Barrmill and was originally part of the Glasgow, Barrhead and Kilmarnock Joint Railway branch from Lugton to Beith. It was the only intermediate station on the route, opening on 26 June 1873, and closing permanently to passengers on 5 November 1962. It was a single platformed station. Freight services continued on the line until 1964. On the 1897 OS map a tramway is shown running down to Barrmill station from quarries at Dockra. ;Views of Giffen station (2008) Image:Giffen railway from overbridge.JPG Looking towards Barrmill from the Giffen overbridge Image:Giffen station from overbridge.JPGGiffen railway station from the overbridge Image:Giffen station facing Barrmill.JPG Giffen station looking towards Barrmill Image:Giffen station.jpgThe Old Kilbirnie Junction station, later Giffen station in 2006 Image:Giffen station points.JPG Pointwork and an old security gate Image:Giffen station blastwall.JPG An old blast wall next to the station Image:Giffen station workmens hut.JPGWorkmen's hut near the blast wall Image:Giffen station sign.JPGOld sign for munitions traffic operations Giffen, Beith, or Nettlehirst limeworks Giffen Limeworks dated from the mid- to late 19th century and later. They were probably the last traditional limeworks to work in Scotland, closing in 1972. A substantial amount remained, the kilns being essentially intact in 2009, with a bank of two single-draw rubble kilns, reinforced with buttresses and with old rails, and heightened in brick. Progressive demolition has been taking place since 2009. Covered conveyors linked the segmental-arched draw holes with a wood-framed, corrugated-iron crushing and bagging mill. The works were at map reference: NS 3645 5073. Limekilns The remains of the old limekiln near Nettlehirst farm Detail of the old Nettlehirst lime kiln Limekilns are a common feature of farms in the area, such as Thirdpart, Foreside, Nettlehirst and the Greenhills hamlet; the necessary limestone was quarried extensively in the neighbourhood. Limekilns came into regular use about the 18th century. Large limestone blocks were used for building but the smaller pieces were burnt, using coal dug in the parishTopographical Dictionary of Scotland (1846).

What is now Burnhouse Manor hotel was present as a private house on the 1858 OS map and as the 'Manor House' in 1911. In the 1870s, whilst nearby Trearne House was being built, Mr and Mrs Ralston-Patrick lived for some time in Burnhouse Manor until the new house was ready for them. A toll house was located on the Dunlop side of the crossroads on the Lochlibo Road, on the Laigh Gree Farm side; it has been demolished. ;Burnhouse Manor and 'The Trap' village (2008) Image:Burnhouse Manor Hotel.JPGThe Burnhouse Manor Hotel Image:Burnhouse village in Ayrshire.JPGBurnhouse village looking towards Lugton Image:Burnhouse village in North Ayrshire.JPGAnother view looking towards Lugton Additional evidence from maps The 1858 OS map shows the spelling as 'Giffen' and indicates the presence of a small whinstone quarry at the bottom of the brae that runs towards Burnhouse. This quarry expanded over the years and eventually destroyed the site of the castle on the Giffen craigs. The castle ruins are clearly marked in 1858, but not afterwards. Drumbuie Drumbuie House, built in 1702, is one of the oldest inhabited houses in the Beith area and has been the home of the Boyd family for at least three generations.Recollections of Tom Boyd.

Mossend Farm Ruins of Mossend Farm The copse at Mossend Farm This may have been the site of a minor mansion house at one time, however by the 1920s only a ruin remained. A whinstone quarry was located to the east of the dwelling. The last occupants of Mossend were George and Ellen Black who used to ride into Beith on a small buggy behind a piebald pony. George was a manufacturer of curling stones, possibly using the whinstone from the Mossend quarry.Porterfield, S. (1925). Rambles Round Beith. Beith: Pilot Press. p. 24 Local history and traditions A mound near Greenhill farm Dockra and South Border Farms The Ayrshire Directory 1837 by Pigot & Co comments, a year before Giffen Castle collapsed, on ...the stately ruined castle of the Montgomeries. The same publication also lists a Land Surveyor named John Giffin and a John Giffen who was associated with the schools. A small hoard of 16th-century coins was found on 7 March 1958 by A Wilson and A M Raeside when ploughing southwest of Mains of Giffen. The coins had been placed in the bronze container of a small nest of weights, 1½ inches in diameter. This box, and 12 of the 19 coins were retained by the National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland (NMAS). All Scottish, they dated between 1558 (a billon \\"nonsunt\\" of Mary) and 1574 (a half-merk of James VI). The coins are mostly half and quarter-merks of James VI; they were probably hidden in the later 1570s.R B K Stevenson, R.B.K.(1960); Proc Soc Antiq Scot 1961. Roughwood Farm was once the caput of a barony within the Lordship of Giffen. Records show that a William Giffen was appointed councillor in 1710 at Corsehill. Trearne house was used by a small boarding school called Gresham House until it was demolished in 1954. The Lugton Ridges were part of the Barony of Giffen and one was also known as Deepstone.Dobie, James D. (ed Dobie, J.S.) (1876).

Mayr (12 October 1830 - 14 July 1908) was an Austrian entomologist and professor in Budapest and Vienna. He specialised in Hymenoptera, being particularly known for his studies of ants.1908\\\\. Obituary. Prof. Gustav Mayr. Entomological News 19:396 Bibliography In 1868, he was the first to describe the Argentine ant.Managing Linepithema Humile (Mayr), the Argentine Ant, in South Carolina by Brittany Russ Ellis He is credited with naming the harvesting ant species, Aphaenogaster treatae, for naturalist Mary Davis Treat in honor of her research on the species.Early American Nature Writers: A Biographical Encyclopedia edited by Daniel Patterson, Roger Thompson, J. Scott Bryson Life and career Mayr was born into the family of a lawyer, Ignaz Mayr, and his wife, née Rosalie Holzer in Vienna. After completing classical high school and studying at the faculty of philosophy, Mayr began studying medicine in Vienna. From 1851 he was a member of the Vienna Botanical and Zoological Society (Zoologisch-Botanische Gesellschaft). He was a doctor of medicine in 1856, then taught natural sciences and chemistry in secondary schools in Pest, but he lost his post in 1861 because of the Magyarization laws which prohibited teaching in German in Hungarian secondary schools. He moved to Vienna where he taught natural history in an Oberrealschule, until his retirement in 1892. The honorary title of imperial advisor (kaiserlicher Rat) was then awarded to him, after having received the golden cross of merit in 1876. Mayr was passionate about entomology and in particular about Hymenoptera, and specialised in the systematics of ants. He donated one of his collections of hymenoptera, bringing together 1,350 species represented by around 5,500 specimens, to the Natural History Museum, Vienna, in 1896. Another collection of 2,180 species of ant, and other collections of insects was bequeathed by him in his will to the Vienna Botanical and Zoological Society, but they later sold it to the Museum, not having the facilities to maintain it. Between 1862 and 1901 he described fifty-eight genera of ant (including Acromyrmex, Anochetus, Aphaenogaster, Camponotus, Formicoxenus, Leptothorax, Monomorium, Tetramorium) and over five hundred new species of ant. He also described unique collections of fossil ants preserved in Baltic amber (1868), ants from Tibet brought back by the expeditions of Nikolay Przhevalsky, and ants from Turkestan collected by the explorer Alexei Fedchenko. He was responsible for writing the zoological part concerning ants in the travel report of the Austrian Imperial Novara expedition that circumnavigated the world between 1857 and 1859. He died in Vienna.  Works  Mayr's works include: * Formicidae [der Novara-Expedition] (Ants of the Novara Expedition). Vienna 1865. * Die Ameisen des baltischen Bernsteins (The Ants of Baltic Amber).

Early life and legal career Shee was born in Finchley, Middlesex. His father, Joseph, was a merchant from Thomastown, County Kilkenny, Ireland, his mother, Teresa née Darell. Nicholas Wiseman was a cousin. He was initially educated at the school for French refugees founded by the Abbé Carron in Somers Town and where Hughes Felicité Robert de Lamennais taught. In 1818 he joined Wiseman as a student at St. Cuthbert's College, Ushaw. He also attended Edinburgh University where he joined The Speculative Society. In 1823 he became a pupil of Thomas Chitty at Lincoln's Inn and was called to the bar in 1828.Barker (2004) Shee enjoyed a successful career as a barrister, being made serjeant-at-law in 1840, receiving a patent of precedence in 1845, and being appointed queen's serjeant in 1857. In 1837, he married Mary Gordon (died 1861) and their children included George Darell Shee and Henry Gordon Shee QC who became Recorder of Burnley and a judge in Salford. Shee's famous cases as an advocate included the Roupell case and leading the unsuccessful defence of poisoner William Palmer in 1856. In the latter case the defence case suffered adverse comment from the judge because Shee had, against all rules and conventions of professional conduct, told the jury that he personally believed Palmer to be innocent.Knott (1912) p.267 He edited a great number of legal publications. Politics :See also Roman Catholicism in Great Britain:The Catholic Revival in the Nineteenth Century. Shee was a champion of Catholic Emancipation and addressed a protestant rally held on Penenden Heath, Maidstone as early as 24 November 1828. He failed in his first attempt to enter parliament at the 1847 general election for Marylebone but succeeded for Kilkenny County in the 1852 general election. He gave his maiden speech on 12 November 1852 during the debate on the Queen's Speech.Hansard 3, 123, 1852, 139–41 Shee became active in Irish tenants' rights. William Sharman Crawford having failed to be re-elected in 1852, Shee took charge of, and reintroduced, his Tenant Right Bill on 25 November 1852. In December, he spoke in support of Sir Joseph Napier's Improvement Compensation Bill but both bills were rejected by a select committee. Shee submitted an amended bill in February 1854 but it fared poorly. In June 1854 he failed in a controversial motion for leave to introduce a bill to amend the laws on the political administration of the Church of Ireland, and to increase funds for Irish religious education and church building. In 1855, discouraged in his exertions as to reform, Shee consulted with Sharman Crawford and drafted a new Tenants' Improvement Compensation Bill, addressing some of the objections of the select committee. It fared no better than his earlier efforts. Shee's failure cost him the support of his voters and he lost his seat in the 1857 general election. Shee was defeated in Kilkenny again in 1859 general election and declined judicial office in Madras in 1860. He stood unsuccessfully in Stoke-on-Trent at a by-election in September 1862. Judge On 19 December 1863, Shee was appointed judge of the Queen's Bench, and knighted the following year.London Gazette, 22 Dec 1863, 6645; London Gazette, 14 June 1864, 3072 He was the first Roman Catholic judge in England since the Glorious Revolution of 1688.

It is generally common in the appropriate habitats within its range. One to five males live within an area of 100 meters^2, consisting of one alpha male, one beta male, and a few gamma males. Each area has four to six display perches which are horizontal vines, branches, or lianas one meter off the ground. The main display arena is cleaned by the alpha and beta males by removing moss, leaves, or twigs from the perch, making it appear whiter.Posada, Ghislaine Cárdenas. “Display Behaviour, Social Organization and Vocal Repertoire of Blue‐Backed Manakin Chiroxiphia Pareola Napensis in Northwest Amazonia.\\" Description Lekking display from Ilhabela, Brazil Formerly, the name \\"swallow-tailed manakin\\" was used widely, but as it is misleading (the tail is unlike that of any swallow), this name has largely been abandoned for \\"superior blue manakin\\". As suggested by this common name, the male is - by far - the manakin with most blue to the plumage. The entire body is bright blue, while the wings, tail and head, except for the red cap, are black. The far duller female is greenish-brown overall. Both sexes have elongated central rectrices. Juvenile males resemble the adult female, but gradually develop first the red crown, then the black face-sides, and finally the remaining plumage of the adult male. The males form leks, typically consisting of a single adult and two sub-adult males, where they sing and \\"dance\\" to attract females. This was shown in the BBC's The Life of Birds documentary series. Due to the pronounced hypergamous nature of its females, up to 90% of male blue manakins never mate.http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/books/2017/06/evolution-beauty- reveals-true-power-sexual-attraction Status This bird has a very wide range, is common and is presumed to have a large total population. The population trend is thought to be stable and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated the bird's conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\".

It was built by the McNamaras about 1540, severely damaged in 1827, and is now restored and opened to the public. History Castlebawn was built by the McNamara chieftains during the mid to late 16th century. Records show that Castlebawn was built by Owen McNamara, but do not give the year of construction. The earliest recorded mention of Castlebawn is 1570, when Sean McNamara, Chief of eastern Clann-Cuilein, died, leaving Castlebawn to his son, Sir John McNamara. McNamaras lived there until the Cromwellian land confiscations of the 17th century when it became disused. In 1820 it became a den for illicit Poitín makers and in 1827 the authorities besieged the towerhouse to drive the occupants out. After the towerhouse was emptied the authorities attempted to demolish the building with explosives. Only the south wall and roof were destroyed. The remaining walls although damaged remained intact. The castle was so well built that three of the walls remained intact. Simon Flannery occupied the castle early in the 20th century, and locally the castle is still referred to as Simon's Castle. In 1929 the construction of the Ardnacrusha power plant caused the water level in Lough Derg to rise significantly shrinking the island on which the towerhouse stands. Restoration In 1996 Pat and Mary Cody completed the restoration of the ruin, which is now open to the public in the summer months, although access is via boat only.

There are three closely related species to this taxon: D. ensatus, (California giant salamander), D. copei (Cope's giant salamander) and D. tenebrosus (coastal giant salamander) also known as the (Pacific giant salamander).C. Michael Hogan. 2008 Description The Idaho giant salamander is the darkest and most intricately blotched of the giant salamanders.Stebbins, 2003. They vary between brown, purple, tan, grey, and a copperish color. Tiger salamanders and Idaho giant salamanders have superficial resemblance pertaining to size and shape, but the costal grooves and foot tubercles are significantly different between the two species. This salamander has a defining thick head and body and a fourth toe on the hind foot with only three segments. Adults are typically 20 cm in lengthRichard Cannings. 2007 but may vary between 7 and 11.75 inches long, but can be observed around 13 inches. Small external gills adapted for small stream living can be found on their larvae. Their larvae are usually tan with yellow blotches over their dermis. They can undergo paedomorphosis, but most become mature adults. Distribution This species of salamander is found in forested watersheds from lake Coeur d’Alene to the Salmon River, and in two locations in Montana around Mineral County. Behavior Larvae are predators but tend to sit and wait for their food to come to them. Usually they feed on small invertebrates and some small vertebrates. This can include tadpoles, fish, and other salamanders. Adults usually feed on terrestrial vertebrates and invertebrates. They will eat things as large as shrews, mice, and small snakes, along with other salamanders. They will eat anything that they can catch. Fish, weasels, water shrews, and garter snakes are a few of their predators. To help defend against these predators they have a few strong defense mechanisms to help them survive. They use toxic secretion from their skin, warning postures, a \\"bark\\" vocalization, and they will bite. An Idaho giant salamander bite can easily break the skin of a human.

Dicamptodon ensatus is endemic to California, in the western United States. The species once additionally included individuals now belonging to the species D. aterrimus (Idaho giant salamander) and D. tenebrosus (coastal giant salamander), under the common name Pacific giant salamander, which now refers to the genus and family. Taxonomy The Pacific giant salamander (D. ensatus) was thought to consist of three geographic populations, an Idaho isolate, a group in northern California, and a group in Oregon and Washington. In 1989 genetic studies showed that the D. ensatus populations consisted of three species: the Idaho giant salamander (Dicamptodon aterrimus) in Idaho, and two highly divergent species with a narrow hybrid zone in California, the coastal giant salamander (Dicamptodon tenebrosus) (ranging from northern California to Washington) and the California giant salamander (Dicamptodon ensatus) (ranging from Santa Cruz County to Mendocino County). A fourth species of Dicamptodon, Cope's giant salamander (D. copei ), lives on the Olympic Peninsula, Washington. Habitat The natural habitats of D. ensatus are temperate forests, rivers, freshwater lakes, and freshwater marshes in northern California. Terrestrial adult in Pescadero Creek County Park, San Mateo county, CA Description The adult California giant salamander can reach 17–30.5 cm (6.7–12 inches) in total length (including tail). Like most salamanders, the California giant salamander has four toes on the front feet and five toes on the back feet. The California giant salamander's tail is approximately 40% of the total length of the salamander and is laterally compressed. The head, back, and sides of the salamander have a marbled or reticulate pattern of dark blotches on a light brown or brassy-colored background. They have a broad head with a shovel-like snout and a fold of skin across the throat called the gular fold. The eyes are medium in size and have a brass-flecked iris and a large black pupil. This species is one of the few salamanders capable of vocalizing. Terrestrial adults search for prey such as snails, slugs, other invertebrates, small mice, shrews, possibly reptiles, and other amphibians under surface objects and in tunnels, whereas aquatic adults and larvae eat aquatic invertebrates, fish, and other amphibians. California giant salamanders are preyed upon by the American water shrew (Sorex palustris) and the western aquatic garter snake (Thamnophis couchi). Reproduction and development The California giant salamander breeds from March to May, with egg-laying peaking in May. Eggs are concealed several feet below the surface in cold, slowly flowing water often beneath rocks and coarse woody debris in stream bottoms. Adults sometimes stay near their nests. Larvae may lose their external gills and transform to terrestrial adults after 1 to 2 years. In permanently perennial streams, adults may retain their gills and become aquatic adults. (See Neotenes below.) Range The California giant salamander is endemic to Northern California and lives up to primarily in damp, coastal forests including coast Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii) and California coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) in both montane and valley-foothill riparian habitats. They tend to be common when they occur. The adult terrestrial form is found under surface litter and in tunnels, while the adult aquatic and larval forms are found mainly in cool, rocky streams and occasionally in lakes and ponds. It is found in two (possibly three) isolated regions. The first range includes Sonoma, Napa, and Marin Counties, southwestern Lake County, western Glenn County, and southern Mendocino County. The other documented region is south of the San Francisco Bay from central San Mateo County to southern Santa Cruz County plus western Santa Clara County. The California giant salamander does not occur in the East Bay, forming a gap between these two populations.Distribution map. iucnredlist.org There is an unconfirmed sight record from Big Sur in Monterey County, approximately 75 miles (100 km) to the south of the documented population in the Santa Cruz area. Neotenes Some California giant salamander larvae continue to grow into adults and become sexually mature without losing their external gills. This process is called neoteny. Adult-sized neotenes have a uniform brown coloring on their heads, sides, and backs and retained external gills which allow them to live in perennial streams as aquatic adults.

They held the monastery till their suppression in 1782. The Benedictines were the first to erect a library. The church is largely a reconstruction from 1498-1504; the architectural design is attributed to Francesco di Giorgio, and Pandolfo Petrucci. The cupola was completed in 1504, but the church was not consecrated till 1513. The marble portal (1519) was designed by Baldassare Peruzzi. The interior houses the Funeral monument of a number of Spaniards, including Daniel Burgos, Ferdinando Alvarez, Pietro Crispo Spagnuoli, and a chapel (Cappella degli Spagnoli) which is one of Sodoma's masterpieces. The chapel was painted (1530) in Renaissance style with tromp-d'oeil and architecture, and includes frescoes of Saints James (Patron of Spain), Anthony, and Sebastian; a canvas of the Virgin and Saints.

It occurs in mountainous regions in the central parts of Asia where it lives in open or lightly wooded habitats, often among rocks where dwarf junipers grow. It is IUCN Red Listed as Least Concern. As suggested by its name, it is a relatively long-tailed species of marmot. Description The long-tailed marmot is a large, sturdy rodent weighing up to . Its typical weight range is from , with the lower weights in the spring directly after hibernation and the higher weights in the autumn just before hibernation where more than one–quarter of its mass can be fat. Males average slightly larger than females. Its head-and-body length is and the tail is about long. The tail is 37–55% of the head-and-body length. This is considerably longer than typical of other marmots, although the proportionally longest-tailed individuals of the grey (M. baibacina) and alpine marmots (M. marmota) are comparable to the shortest-tailed individuals of the long-tailed marmot. The eyes are close to the top of the rather-flattened head, the ears are small and the neck is short. The forelegs are longer than the hind legs. Several subspecies have been described for the long-tailed marmot, but only three are generally recognised: M. c. caudata, M. c. aurea and M. c. dichrous. The last has occasionally been considered a separate species. They differ in colours and some measurements, with M. c. caudata averaging larger than the others. M. c. aurea, the subspecies found in most of its range, is relatively bright golden-buff or orange-tawny overall. Its face is brownish and the top of its head is typically brown to black, but in small parts of its range it is the same colour as its back. The tip of the tail often is blackish. M. c. caudata also has a brown face, and its flanks and undeparts are yellowish, but the rear top of its head and mid-back are black, while the tail is black or mixed yellowish and black. M. c. dichrous is black-brown below, but this subspecies is dimorphic in the colour of its upperparts: they are blackish- brown to dull brown in dark animals, and light brown to cream in pale animals. Distribution and habitat The long-tailed marmot is restricted to Afghanistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, far southern Kazakhstan (where rare), Uzbekistan, northern Pakistan, northernwestern India and western China. In China, it has only been recorded in the Tian Shan Mountains of Xinjiang. Other mountain ranges where it occurs are the Pamir, Alay, Hindukush, Kunlun-Shan, Karakoram and northwestern Himalayas. Although its distribution comes into contact with those of the Menzbier's (M. menzbieri), grey (M. baibacina) and Himalayan marmots (M. himalayana), they are not known to hybridise. Among its three subspecies, M. c. aurea is widespread and found in all countries where the species occurs, only being absent from the regions inhabited by the two remaining subspecies. M. c. caudata is from areas south of Chitral in Pakistan and adjacent parts of India, and M. c. dichrous is from highlands near Kabul and Ghazni in Afghanistan. Overall the long-tailed marmot has a very wide altitude range, occurring from , but this varies extensively depending on each mountain range with the upper limit essentially restricted by the location of the permanent snow line. The only countries where it has been recorded below are Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, but in both places it also occurs much higher. It is more tolerant of aridity than the closely related Menzbier's marmot and the more distantly related grey marmot, and where their distributions approach each other the long-tailed marmot tends to occupy drier habitats. Furthermore, where its distribution approaches that of the Menzbier's marmot the long- tailed occurs at lower altitudes from . The long-tailed marmot occurs in a wide range of open or lightly wooded habitats, including alpine meadows, foothill to highland steppes, semi-deserts, scrublands and open woodland (typically with junipers no more than high), especially in rocky areas. However, it avoids places with saline soils.  Ecology and behaviour  Marmot hunted by a 226x226px The long-tailed marmot usually forms monogamous relationships but lives in larger social groups, with up to seven adults sharing a single home range. These individuals are likely to be related to each other with young adults normally only dispersing after they have become fully grown at three or more years of age. Adult immigrants are tolerated in the group but only a single adult female normally lactates and rears young in any one season. Home ranges of the long-tailed marmot average about and contain about three burrow systems (range one to six). In a chamber in one of these burrows the marmots hibernate from about September to April or May, a period during which the ground is covered with snow for much of the time. Different burrows may be used for hibernation in different years. Mating occurs in late April and early May and may take place underground before the marmots emerge from the burrow after the winter. The gestation period is about four and a half weeks and the litter of about four pups emerges from the nest at about six weeks of age. Only about half of the pups survive the summer, some being consumed by predators and others being killed by adult males joining the group. Most adults survive the hibernation period but a rather higher proportion of juveniles die during their first winter. Females do not usually breed as three-year-olds but wait till the following year. The long- tailed marmot is diurnal and feeds on plant material. It is most active in the morning when about 40% of the time is spent foraging. After emerging from the burrow, the marmot spreads out and do not forage as a group. Food is either collected from the ground by the mouth or plucked from taller plants. Between bouts of foraging, a marmot sometimes stands on its back legs and surveys its surroundings. Group members communicate with each other, emitting complex alarm calls when predators are spotted. They also react to alarm calls of neighbouring groups.  Predators  Predators of the long-tailed marmot include the red fox (Vulpes vulpes), the grey wolf (Canis lupus), the golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) and possibly the bearded vulture (Gypaetus barbatus). On the Tibetan plateau, marmot species also form part of snow leopard prey.

Established in the late 1830s as part of lands allocated to the Cherokee Nation, this area was later leased by the federal government and known as the Leased District. The area that became known as the Quapaw Agency Lands contained 220,000 acres and was located in the northeastern corner of Oklahoma where that state adjoins Missouri and Kansas. After the Civil War, the Cherokee were forced to cede the land and the US assigned it to several other tribes. This area was settled prior to 1874 by 24 Indian groups. These range from full Indian tribes down to the remnants of several larger Indian groups whose main body settled elsewhere. The agency was disbanded in 1890 by the Oklahoma Organic Act, which was designed to extinguish tribal communal land claims. The land was attached to an Indian Territory prior to passage of the Dawes Act and distribution of plots to individual households. Another Indian reserve, the Miami Indian Agency based in Miami, Oklahoma was disbanded at the same time. All Native American claims were extinguished prior to Oklahoma's admission to statehood in the 20th century. History Among the tribes who were forcibly removed to these lands from east of the Mississippi River were people of the Algonquin and the Iroquois tribes. In the early colonial period, at the time of Samuel de Champlain, they were great enemies. Here also, plowing and harvesting their fields together and sharing each other's native ceremonials, was a tribe of the mighty Siouan nation, as well as one of the Lupuamian nation. Within the memories of their grandfathers, these old and powerful tribes had owned many hundreds of thousands of acres in Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Oregon. Since early territorial days of 1867, a federal Indian agency operated to manage the relationship between the federal government and these various tribes, supervising provision of annuities and supplies, for instance. But not all of the business handled by the agent was tribal business. The Indian Agent often found acted as a mediator in settling neighborhood and family disputes, as well. Because the land was originally given to the Quapaw Tribe, this area was renamed in the 19th century as the Quapaw Agency Lands. Prior to this, it and other nearby areas had been known as the Neosho Indian Agency, the Shawnee Indian Agency, and the Seneca Indian Agency, representing major tribes settled in the area. The agency was originally located four miles west of Seneca, Missouri, and later moved to Wyandotte in the Indian Territory as the Native Americans were settled there. In 1873, 153 surviving members of a Modoc band formerly headed by Captain Jack (Kintpuash), were relocated here from northern California after their defeat. Kintpuash was hanged, executed by the US Army for charges of war crimes. The Modoc were long colocated with the Shawnee on their reserve at what became known as the Quapaw Agency. The agency did not receive sufficient supplies and the Modoc suffered greatly in their first months. In 1920, two agencies were established; the Seneca and Quapaw. In 1922 they were combined again and became the Quapaw Agency. Due to the proximity of their reservations, there were many intermarriages among members of the tribes in this northeast area. Several tribes eventually merged their governments. Some of the individual listings below will lead the researcher to the federally recognized tribal names by which these nations are known today. Primary Tribes The Primary tribes of the Quapaw Indian Agency were: * Eastern Shawnee, from Indiana, and Ohio * Miami, from Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio * Modoc, from the California-Oregon border * Ottawa, from Michigan, Ohio, and Illinois * Peoria of the Illinois Confederation, from Illinois, * Quapaw Tribe, from Arkansas along the western bank of the Mississippi River * Seneca and Cayuga of the Iroquois Confederacy, from New York * Wyandotte, from Ohio Other Resources Daniel B.

This species of torrent salamander is found the farthest south in the region. It is a small salamander endemic to the Pacific Northwest from Northern California to Northern Oregon. It is one of four species of Rhyacotriton, along with R. cascadae, R. kezeri and R. olympicus. All species of Rhyacotriton are small, with their body lengths being less than 5 inches. The species reproduces annually, with an extended courtship and egg-laying period. The time it takes from oviposition to reach sexual maturity ranges from five to eight years, making the generation interval rather long. The larval stage, from hatching to metamorphosis, lasts 2.0-2.5 yr, with females requiring another 1.5–2.0 yr until they can first breed. They reach sexual maturity 1.0-1.5 yr after metamorphosis which occurs between 4.5 and 5.0 yr. This species feeds on small insects and spiders. Although it is found over a large area, it is not a migratory creature. It is preyed on by Pacific giant salamanders and garter snakes. Identification The species in the genus Rhyacotriton are all similar in morphology, but have high genetic diversity. R. variegatus lives in aquatic environments from egg through metamorphic stages. Through adulthood individuals live on the waters edge among pebbles and rocks. R. variegatus has the lowest desiccation tolerance of all North American salamanders, meaning they cannot easily withstand “extreme” temperatures and low moisture levels. The habitats preferred by R. variegatus are cool, shallow, high in oxygen, and slow- flowing, such as seeps and mountain brooks, with coarse, gravel-like beds. These water sources are found mostly in forests, which is where R. variegatus is most often found. All species of Rhyacotriton have aquatic eggs and larvae, and adults are semi-aquatic. R. variegatus adults can venture away from the stream, but they prefer the water, only coming out when the moisture level of the ground is high enough. Adults and juveniles are subject to moisture loss as well as heat shock. General description and taxonomy The southern torrent salamanders are small salamanders; mature adults measure from 1.5–2.4 inches snout to vent. On their dorsal sides, they are brown with darker spots. Their ventral sides are more yellow, with the same spots as the dorsal sides. The colors vary by shades; the dorsal sides range from dark olive to a dark brown. Their eyes face forwards and are large and dark, and metallic flecks surround the eyes. Males are distinguished from the females by their square cloacal lobes. Lungs of the adults are also reduced in appearance. Their bodies are slender, with long tails about the same length as their torsos. They have four legs, set in pairs – two close to the head, and two near the base of the tail. At the base of the leg, they have four toes used to grip and climb. Generally, they have blunt noses and protruding eyes. Geographic distribution The genus Rhyacotriton is found in the Pacific Northwest, extending from Northern California to the Olympic Peninsula. R. variegatus is endemic to the southernmost part of the range, extending from California to Oregon. Populations of R. variegatus are found in forests of the coastal regions of the states. Some Rhyacotriton species are found more inland, but they are still relatively close to the coast; these are mainly populations of R. kezeri. The areas with populations of R. variegatus are forests with fresh water sources that meet all of their habitat requirements. Although most of the population is in one continuous range, a smaller population separated from the main range is found in southwest Oregon. Though it is disconnected from the range, it is still close to the coastline. Ecology R. variegatus occurs in coastal coniferous forests in California and Oregon. Older forests are more likely to maintain a population of southern torrent salamanders. These forests have >80% canopy coverage due to sizeable trees, as well as large amounts of moss. Some younger forests have the proper habitat to keep a population, but it is unusual to see a population living in a young forest. Reproduction occurs in the water, where the fertilized eggs are laid and abandoned. Mating occurs after an extended courtship, and is followed by a long egg-laying process. The eggs take quite some time to hatch, and the whole larval stage lasts about 2.0-2.5 yr. Usually, the female lays one egg at a time, but occasionally clutches of eight to 11 eggs are found. Conservation Efforts have been made to conserve this species. After being assessed, it was placed in the “Least Concern” category, meaning there is no immediate threat to the survival of the species, and it has a wide distribution with an assumed large population. Though there is no immediate threat to the southern torrent salamander, urbanization is beginning to encroach on its habitat. Direct effects from logging and disturbing forests with the building of roads and other man-made features are limiting the habitable areas for these salamanders. Other indirect effects from urbanization are those that are affecting the temperature of the environment. R. variegatus is extremely sensitive to temperature fluctuations, having a very narrow range of temperatures in which it can thrive. The salamanders will begin to show temperature stress at about 63 °F. If the temperature of mountain streams and brooks rises over the next few years, the species will either have to adapt or succumb to the warm temperature. In California, R. variegatus is a Species of Special Concern. The composition of the ground in the habitat is also quite important. If the texture of the components is too fine, then the environment would not be ideal. R. variegatus needs large, pebble-like particles to be able to hide and avoid predators. Many concerned people still petition to place R. variegatus in a more at-risk category because of the previously unregulated logging that altered the population. The species will remain at least concern status until the populations become more threatened.

John Gregorie, was an eighteenth-century Scottish Enlightenment physician, medical writer and moralist. Life Gregory was born in Aberdeen, Scotland to the professor of medicine James Gregorie and Anna Chalmers, his father's second wife; his grandfather was the distinguished mathematician and astronomer James Gregory. Following the death of his father when he was eight years old, Gregory's education was conducted by Principal Chalmers, his grandfather, and his half- brother James, a professor of medicine. His cousin Thomas Reid, the moral philosopher, also guided and influenced his education. Gregory attended a local grammar school and later King's College, University of Aberdeen. In 1742 he and his mother moved to Edinburgh where he studied medicine. There he became friends with the physician and poet Mark Akenside. Gregory went to Leiden to continue his studies in 1745. In 1746, soon after receiving his degree, he was appointed professor of philosophy at King's College. He taught mathematics and moral and natural philosophy. He was also a practicing doctor and preferring patients to lecturing, he resigned his academic post in 1749. On 2 April 1752, Gregory married Elizabeth Forbes. Together they had three sons, including the physician James Gregory, and three daughters. In 1754 the family moved to London and they entered the social circle of John Wilkes, Charles Townshend, George Lyttelton and Elizabeth Montagu. It was at this time that he started spelling his name \\"Gregory\\" rather than \\"Gregorie\\". In 1756 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. Gregory subsequently returned to Aberdeen to take up another academic post. While at Aberdeen, Gregory attempted to institute a series of medical lectures, but there were too few medical students to sustain them. He also became an active member of Aberdeen Philosophical Society which he had co-founded with 5 others including Prof Robert Trail. The paper he presented there were later collected and published anonymously in A Comparative View of the State and Faculties of Man, with those of the Animal World (1765). Gregory believed in a universal human nature that could be discovered through scientific experiment. The most important elements of human nature, as he saw it, were reason and instinct. He wrote that \\"the task of improving our nature, of improving man's estate, involves the proper development and exercise of the social principle and the other principle of instinct, with reason subordinate to instinct and serving as a corrective on it\\".Qtd. in Lawrence. Studying the natural world leads to a cultivation of good taste and religious understanding for Gregory. Portrait of Dr John Gregory, painted by George Chalmers. In what would become his most famous publication, Gregory wrote A Father's Legacy to his Daughters after the death of his wife in 1761 to honour her memory and record her thoughts on female education. Originally Gregory meant only to give the text to his daughters when he died, but his son James published it in 1774; it became a best-seller, going through many editions and translations. In writing this work, he may have been influenced by the celebrated Bluestocking Elizabeth Montagu. The text advises parents and women on religion, moral conduct, friendship and interactions with men, with a focus on marriage. He suggested that women refrain from exposing any learning that they might have, as this would damage their ability to attract a husband. Mary Wollstonecraft would later attack these principles in A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792), arguing that Gregory's advice amounted to nothing more than deceit on the part of women. Gregory moved to Edinburgh in 1764, where he established a medical practice. Two years later Gregory was appointed the first physician in Scotland to George III and made a member of the faculty of Edinburgh University. His appointment was not undisputed and one professor resigned because Gregory was selected rather than William Cullen. Between 1767 and 1769, Gregory gave a series of lectures on medicine and in 1769, he and Cullen gave joint sources on medical practice and medical theory. He published some of his lectures as Observations on the Duties and Offices of a Physician and on the Method of Prosecuting Enquiries in Philosophy (1770). These writings have been called \\"the first philosophical, secular medical ethics in the English language\\". Gregory also published Elements of the Practice of Physic (1772), which investigated the nosology of disease and the diseases of children. Gregory died in Edinburgh on 9 February 1773. He is buried in Canongate Churchyard but the plot bears only the name of his son, James, also a prominent doctor and Professor of Medicine. The latter was famed for creating \\"Gregory's Powder\\" and \\"Gregory's Mixture\\", both frequently used for stomach complaints until World War I. Elizabeth Montagu wrote of John: \\"The hours I passed in his company were amongst the most delightful in my life. He was instructive and amusing, but was much more; one loved Dr Gregory for the sake of virtue and virtue (one might almost say) for the sake of Dr Gregory.\\"Lawrence, Paul. \\"John Gregory.\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography.

His debut studio album, Seeing Is Believing, was released in 1994, consisting mostly of cover versions of traditional tracks and soul songs from the 1960s and 1970s. Released in the United States only, it failed to chart on the Billboard 200 and thus, was never released in Europe. Following a fall-out with main producer Nicole Dürr, he signed with Frankfurt am Main-based Pelham Power Productions (3P) and began appearing as a background vocalist on several of his label-mates' albums. Naidoo's second studio album Nicht von dieser Welt, produced unter the guidance of Moses Pelham and Martin Haas, was released in May 1998. The album peaked at number one on the German Albums Chart and sold more than a million copies. Its singles included his debut single \\"20.000 Meilen\\", the top twenty entries \\"Nicht von dieser Welt\\" and \\"Seine Straßen\\" as well as top five hit \\"Sie sieht mich nicht\\", which served as the theme song for the feature film Asterix & Obelix Take On Caesar (1999). A gold-certified live album of his first concert tour, simply titled Live (1999), reached the top ten in Germany the following year. His third effort, the double album Zwischenspiel – Alles für den Herrn, was released on his own label Naidoo Records in March 2002 after his departure from 3P. An instant success, it debuted atop the charts in both Austria and Germany and was certified double platinum by the Bundesverband Musikindustrie (BVMI). Three of its four singles, including \\"Wo willst du hin?\\" and \\"Abschied nehmen\\", became top five hits on the singles charts. In 2003, he collaborated with American rapper RZA on his compilation album The World According to RZA; their single \\"Ich kenne nichts (das so schön ist wie du)\\" reached number-one on the German Singles Chart and the top three in Austria and Switzerland, becoming his highest-charting single up to that point. The same year, his second live album ...Alles Gute vor uns... was released to gold status and top ten success. Naidoo's fourth album Telegramm für X was released in November 2005. It reached number-one in Austria, Germany, and Switzerland was certified quadruple platinum by the BVMI. The album produced the top three singles \\"Dieser Weg\\" and \\"Was wir alleine nicht schaffen\\", while his second number-one hit \\"Danke\\", a song about the 2006 FIFA World Cup, was included on a reissue of the album. Alles kann besser werden, his fifth studio album, was released in 2009. It became his fifth number-one album in Germany, and reached the three in Austria and Switzerland. \\"Alles kann besser werden\\", its lead single, reached number six on the German Singles Chart though subsequent singles were less successful. Gespaltene Persönlichkeit, a collaboration album with rapper Kool Savas, was released in 2012. It debuted at number atop the charts in Germany and Switzerland and was certified platinum by the BVMI. Single \\"Schau nicht mehr zurück\\" entered the top three in both countries. The same year, Naidoo's first compilation album Danke fürs Zuhören – Liedersammlung 1998–2012 was released to number-one success throughout German-speaking Europe. Mordsmusik, a dubstep album produced under his pseudonym Der Xer, and Bei meiner Seele were both released the following year. The latter album peaked at number one in Austria and Germany and featured the same-titled top two hit. A highly demanded producer, songwriter and guest vocalist, Naidoo has collaborated with several musicians and musical projects, including all-male vocal group Söhne Mannheims, the Christian music project Zeichen der Zeit, the transnational anti-racism project Brothers Keepers, and the cast of the television series Sing meinen Song - Das Tauschkonzert, the German version of The Best Singers series.

A decree of Pope Pius IX (21 July 1871) canonically erected it into a religious congregation, and on 8 May 1885 Pope Leo XIII approved the constitutions. The aim of the society is to render \\"before all else solemn and perpetual adoration to Our Lord Jesus Christ, abiding perpetually in the Most Blessed Sacrament of the Altar for the love of men\\". \\"The Congregation of the Servants of the Most Blessed Sacrament devote themselves with all their souls and all their strength to propagate this same worship of adoration and love in the world, especially by means of the People's Eucharistic League in the way that was erected by a Rescript of August 2, 1872 (Bishops and Regulars), by Retreats of Adoration, and the work of the worship of Jesus Christ\\"; that is, by work for poor churches, as well as by catechetical instruction to children and to poor or ignorant adults. Each sister is required to make three adorations in the twenty-four hours, of which two are in the day and one at night. The Divine Office is said in choir. The community is contemplative and cloistered. The initial mother-house was at Angers, France. The congregation's houses at Lyon (France) was founded 29 June 1874; Paris - founded 1 May, 1876; Binche (Belgium) - founded 17 November 1894. In October 1903, at the request of Bishop Labrecqueof Chicoutimi, a house was established at Chicoutimi on the banks of the Saguenay. The first exposition took place on 22 October 1903, in the chapel of the Sisters of Good Counsel, who for several months extended hospitality to the newly arrived community. On 25 March 1906, it took possession of a new convent and on 18 June 1909 the chapel of the Eucharistic Heart of Jesus was consecrated.

Roles * Barker (spoken role) * Tom (tenor) * Mary (mezzo-soprano) * Pierre Lafitte (baritone) * Dominique You (tenor) * Gaoler (bass) * The Lady Valerie (soprano) Synopsis Prologue At The Cabildo, a tourguide (Barker) leads a group of tourists to the cell where the notorious pirate, Pierre Lafitte, was imprisoned during the War of 1812. The guide tells the story of Pierre and his beloved Lady Valerie, then leads the group on. Tom and Mary, two newlyweds, remain in the cell and sing of their love. Tom rejoins the tour group while Mary stays behind, saying that she is tired. Wondering about the pirate and his lover, she falls asleep. The Dream It is now 1812. The British hold New Orleans under siege and Pierre Lafitte awaits execution in his cell. He is wrongly accused of having ordered the destruction of his own ship, the Falcon, and of the death of his lover Lady Valerie (who was a passenger) in order to cover his supposed theft of her bracelet. Alone in his cell, he vows to find Valerie before facing the firing squad. The drunken Gaoler brings Lafitte's lieutenant, Dominique You, into the cell. Dominique tells Pierre that General (later President) Andrew Jackson has come to an agreement with Pierre's brother Jean Lafitte. Pierre will find the cell door open for his escape, in return for the pirates' full participation in breaking the British siege and defending New Orleans. Pierre, however, is more concerned about the fate of Valerie. Dominique reluctantly tells him that the Falcon is lost, and urges him to tell the truth about the bracelet, which Valerie gave him as a token of their love. Pierre refuses, then sings of his love for Valerie. Dominique gives Pierre the bracelet which, minutes earlier, he had surreptitiously removed from the Governor's desk. He leaves as Pierre invokes Valerie's name. The ghost of Valerie appears and tells of the destruction of the Falcon and her subsequent drowning by one of Lafitte's own men. Pierre now wishes only to join her in death, but Valerie insists that he clear his name by joining General Jackson. They recall the evening when she gave Pierre the bracelet, and then sing of their love in a climactic duet. As she leaves, Valerie tells Pierre she has unlocked the cell door, making way for his escape. Epilogue Tom returns to the cell to find Mary awakening from her dream. She insists that her dream was real, and that \\"it was not the General who made a hero of Lafitte. It was the Lady Valerie and love.\\" Recording * Delos DE 3170: Stephen Mo Hanan, Anthony Dean Griffey, Charlotte Hellekant, Eugene Perry, Paul Groves, Thomas Paul, Lauren Flanigan; The New York Concert Singers; Instrumental ensemble; Ransom Wilson, conductor References External links * US Opera link * Delos Records page on recording Category:English-language operas Category:Operas set in the United States Category:Operas Category:Operas by Amy Beach Category:1932 operas ","title":"Cabildo (opera)"},{"id":"12418108","text":"Correa reflexa, green form Correa reflexa var. nummulariifolia Correa reflexa, commonly known as common correa or native fuchsia, is a shrub which is endemic to Australia. Description Plants are quite variable and a large number of varieties and local forms have been identified. Heights vary from prostrate to 1.5 metres high. Leaves are generally oval in shape and range from 10mm to 50mm long. Their surfaces often have visible oil glands and short hairs. The pendant, tubular flowers occur in groups of 1 to 3 and are up to 40 mm long with 4 flaring triangular tips. Colour is variable including pale green, red with yellow tips and other variations. Taxonomy The species was first formally described in 1800 by botanist Jacques Labillardière in Relation du Voyage à la Recherche de la Pérouse based on the type from Adventure Bay in southern Tasmania. He gave it the name Mazeutoxeron reflexum and published the description in Relation du Voyage à la Recherche de la Pérouse. The species was transferred to the genus Correa as C. reflexa in 1803 by Étienne Pierre Ventenat in Jardin de la Malmaison. The following varieties are accepted by the Australian Plant Census: *C. reflexa var. angustifolia Paul G.Wilson \\\\- Grampians correa (Vic.) *C. reflexa var. insularis Paul G.Wilson (S.A.) *C. reflexa var. lobata Paul G.Wilson \\\\- Powelltown correa (Vic.) *C. reflexa var. nummulariifolia (Hook.f.) Paul G.Wilson \\\\- roundleaf correa (Tas.) *C. reflexa (Labill.) Vent. var. reflexa (S.A., Qld., N.S.W., A.C.T., Vic., Tas.) *C. reflexa var. scabridula Paul G.Wilson \\\\- western correa (S.A.,Vic.) *C. reflexa var. speciosa (Donn ex Andrews) Paul G.Wilson \\\\- eastern correa (N.S.W., Vic.) Natural hybrids have been recorded with Correa alba, C. pulchella, C. aemula and C. decumbens. Use in horticulture Correa reflexa prefers a position with good drainage and some shade. The species is generally not suited to tropical regions, although use of forms from sub-tropical areas of New South Wales may afford some success. Tip pruning after flowering promotes a more compact form and enhanced flowering in the following season. Plants are generally pest and disease free. Propagation from seed is difficult, but plants may be readily propagated from semi-mature cuttings of new seasons growth which also ensures plants are true-to-form. Correa reflexa has received the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

The system is used to deliver radiosurgery for the treatment of benign tumors, malignant tumors and other medical conditions. Device The device combines a compact linear accelerator mounted on a robotic manipulator, and an integrated image guidance system. The image guidance system acquires stereoscopic kV images during treatment, tracks tumor motion, and guide the robotic manipulator to precisely and accurately align the treatment beam to the moving tumor. The system is designed for stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). The system is also used for select 3D conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) and intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). History The system was invented by John R. Adler, a Stanford University professor of neurosurgery and radiation oncology, and Peter and Russell Schonberg of Schonberg Research Corporation. It was a development of the first 3D irradiation treatment realized with a linear accelerator producing 4 MeV X rays at that time still used only on plar dimensions as a CAT, by the physicist Renzo Carlo Avanzo in the hospital of Vicenza (Italy). The Cyberknife was the first dedicated linac (linear accelerator) increasing precision and decreasing the time of the treatment. The first system was installed at Stanford University in 1991 and was cleared by the FDA for clinical investigation in 1994. After years of clinical investigation the FDA cleared the system for the treatment of intracranial tumors in 1999 and for the treatment of tumors anywhere in the body in 2001. Since the original design, Accuray Incorporated released seven CyberKnife System models over the years: the CyberKnife G3 System in 2005, the CyberKnife G4 System in 2007, the CyberKnife VSI System in 2009, the CyberKnife M6 System in 2012, and the CyberKnife S7 System in 2020. Clinical application The system is used to treat tumors of the pancreas, liver, prostate, spine, cancer of the throat and brain, and benign tumors.

It is found in forest, woodland, second growth, plantations, and wooded savanna in southeastern Mexico, Central America, and northern and central South America (as far south as northern Argentina). Though generally uncommon, it is the most common species of Accipiter in most of its range, but it does not occur at altitudes above such as the highest parts of the Andes. Description At in length and in weight, it is significantly smaller than the northern goshawk of Eurasia and North America, and somewhat smaller than the Cooper's hawk of North America, but among the largest Accipiter hawks in Central and South America (only the rare grey- bellied hawk is larger). As in other Accipiter hawks, the female is far larger than the male. Adults are grey above with darker wings and crown, and a banded tail. The underparts typically vary from dark grey to very pale grey, but the southern subspecies can sometimes be rufescent below. The thighs are always pure rufous (not always easily seen), and the underwing coverts are white in the northern subspecies and rufous in the southern. Juveniles are very variable. They can be white, buff or rufous below, and sometimes with dark streaks. Their upperparts are browner than in adults, and the thighs are sometimes paler. Taxonomy The bicolored hawk is a species in the genus Accipiter and is included in the family Accipitridae. Three subspecies are currently recognized. The bicolored hawk is also closely related to the Cooper's hawk (A. cooperii) and the Gundlach's hawk (A. gundlachi); these three form a superspecies. Until recently, the Chilean hawk (A. chilensis) from the colder, southernmost South America was treated as a race of A. bicolor but due to its differences in habitat preferences and plumages from the bicolored hawk, A. chilensis is now considered a full species.Accipiter bicolor. Globalraptors.org (2012-07-27). Retrieved on 2013-04-03. Four subspecies of A. bicolor are acknowledged. These are: *A. b. bicolor, which is found in Southeastern Mexico and south through northern South America. Adults have a black crown, slate upper parts and a blackish tail that displays two or three pale bars. The primaries are obscurely barred. *A. b. fidens, which occurs in Eastern and Southern Mexico. It is morphologically similar to A. b. bicolor, but is larger in size and darker in color. *A. b. pileatus, living in Brazil. Adults are similar to A. b. bicolor, but are much paler and have a pearl-grey collar. Under-wing coverts and thighs are rufous. *A. b. guttifer; located in South Bolivia and northern Argentina. The underparts of the adult are grey or extensively salmon rufous with large white spots and bars. Habitat and distribution The bicolored hawk is widespread but uncommonly observed. Its range extends from Mexico to west Ecuador, the Guianas to Colombia, south to east Peru, through Amazonian Brazil to Paraguay, north- northwestern Argentina, Bolivia and to Chile. It mainly resides in forest, along forest edges and in clearings in tropical and locally subtropical zones, although its habitat is none too specialized. It may also reside in rain forest, drier, thinned forest, and palm savanna with gallery forest. Forest disturbance and fragmentation negatively affect the habitat and quantity of the bicolored hawk, which is most abundant in primary undisturbed forest or riparian forest. There are fewer hawks in disturbed habitats such as forests that have been logged, and even fewer in those fragmented habitats that provide greater than 66% forest cover. These hawks are rarely present in forests that provide less than 66% forest cover. Behaviour The bicolored hawk is difficult to detect due to its shyness and inconspicuousness. Because of this behaviour, the bicolored hawk may be more common than it seems.gavião- bombachinha-grande (Accipiter bicolor)  WikiAves – A Enciclopédia das Aves do Brasil. WikiAves (2009-07-11). Retrieved on 2013-04-03. Vocalisations Its vocalisations are mainly subdued and unnoticeable. Males have been heard to give a soft, clear whistle and females can emit a loud \\"cac cac cac\\" when around the nest and young. A barking \\"kra-kra-kra-kr-kr-kr-ka\\" may also be heard from both sexes. During incubation, males give a sharp \\"kek\\" vocalisation upon arrival to the nest with food, to which the female replies with a nasal \\"wreh\\". Diet These hawks capture prey in a stealthy manner by flying through dense vegetation to ambush unsuspecting prey. They may also capture prey through aerial pursuit after inconspicuously sitting and watching their target.Overview – Bicolored Hawk (Accipiter bicolor) – Neotropical Birds. Neotropical.birds.cornell.edu. Retrieved on 2013-04-03. At times, the bicoloured hawk may hunt in pairs. Most commonly, it feeds on smaller birds such as thrushes and small doves but has also been known to consume small mammals including bats and reptiles. Several instances where the hawks attack groups of squirrel monkeys or tamarins have been witnessed. In addition, these hawks may follow groups of monkeys in order to feed on the insects that are exposed by the monkeys. Reproduction Bicolored hawks breed in forest areas, choosing to build nests on tree branches and occasionally hanging vines. The nest is built in cooperation between the male and female and is constructed from dried sticks and leaves. Each breeding pair will normally build a new nest at the beginning of each breeding year. Copulation occurs after breeding activities such as feeding and nest building have been completed. Egg laying takes place approximately five weeks after copulation and the dull white eggs measure an average of 47.1 mm × 36.5 mm; clutches average 1–3 eggs. The eggs are brooded for about three weeks by the female while the male forages for food. Bicolored hawk chicks are categorized as semi-altricial; the eyes are open at hatching but the chicks are not immediately mobile and are fed by the parents.Parental Care. People.eku.edu. Retrieved on 2013-04-03. The young fledge around 30–36 days after hatching and the fledgling period spans nearly seven weeks, during which the young will return to the nest frequently for food until they become independent.

Description Chestnut-flanked sparrowhawk has blackish grey upperparts with a very distinctive pattern on the underparts distinctive; the breast and belly are heavily barred grey and brown, with chestnut colored flanks. The throat is white and the head is rather broad compared to similar species. The cere is yellow as is the thin eyering which surrounds the red eye. Females and juveniles are browner. They sit tall and have a wingspan of . Distribution The chestnut-flanked sparrowhawk occurs in west central Africa from southern Nigeria through Cameroon and Gabon to Democratic Republic of Congo. It is said to occur in the Upper Guinean forests west of Nigeria but this has not been confirmed. Habitat The chestnut-flanked sparrowhawk is found mainly in lowland tropical rainforest, mainly in the middle storey but it can adapt to dense secondary growth and will approach habitation in the forest. It is found up to above sea level. Habits The habits of the chestnut-flanked sparrowhawk are poorly known but it is known to lay eggs during January to April in Gabon. It probably feeds mainly on birds but has been recorded catching bats. As it is rarely seen in the open it is presumed to be a still hunter which sits in the cover of foliage and sallies out to catch prey. Has been known to enter houses after poultry and to follow driver ant columns to ambush the attendant small birds. Taxonomy Closely related to the African goshawk Accipiter tachiro and the red-chested goshawk Accipiter toussenelii, albeit smaller than either of those species. It is normally regarded as monotypic, although some authorities recognise the smaller birds in the Congo Basin as the subspecies Accipiter castanilius beniensis.

Distribution and subspecies There are currently two recognised subspecies of red-thighed sparrowhawk. *Accipiter erythropus erythropus: Senegal and Gambia west to Nigeria. *Accipiter erythropus zenkeri: Cameroon west to western Uganda, central Democratic Republic of the Congo and Gabon south to northern Angola. Habitat The red-thighed sparrowhawk is found in lowland primary rainforest, along the forest edges and in clearings, as well as in older secondary forest. Habits The red-thighed sparrowhawk is a secretive and crepuscular species that spends most of the day perched in the interior of the forest. Its main prey is small birds up to the size of pigeons as well as lizards, amphibians, and insects. Prey is captured in quick dashes from a perch in the forest understory. This species often hunts co-operatively in pairs to harass mixed-species bird flocks. The breeding behaviour is little known but it does build a small stick nest in the fork of a tree, the only record being a family of five recorded in Liberia in December 1996.

It is one of 21 endemic bird species of Cuba. The common name and Latin binomial commemorate the German-Cuban ornithologist Juan Cristobal Christoff Gundlach (1810–1896). It is threatened by habitat loss and human persecution. Description The hawk is a medium-sized forest raptor. It stands between 43–51 cm in height and has a stocky body shape. The adult hawk has a dark bluish-gray upper body and wings, with a black head. The under body of the bird is a lighter color. It also has a striped tail that is rounded in flight. Immature hawks are mostly brown on the top and paler on the bottom, but with dark streaking down the body.BirdLife International (2013) Species factsheet: Accipiter gundlachi. Compared to other raptors such as the bicolored hawk, Gundlach's hawks are shorter and faster. Behavior Breeding Typically, Gundlach's hawk nests high up in trees in the forest, such as pines, at about an altitude of 19–25 meters. Nesting high allows for hawks to prey on other birds that nest at much lower altitudes. Also, the altitude helps protect against predators. This is not uncommon to the accipiter genera. Nests are commonly made of smaller twigs from the trees that are found in the habitat. Feeding Gundlach's hawk feeds almost exclusively on birds. Because of the hawks large feet, it can feed on the Cuban Parrot, the Cuban Parakeet, and the Cuban Macaw (before it became extinct). Other birds in its diet include doves, pigeons, quail and chicken.Reynard, George B., Lester L. Short, and Orlando H. Garrido. \\"Nesting, Voice, Status, And Relationships Of The Endemic Cuban Gundlach's Hawk (Accipiter Gundlachi).\\" Wilson Bulletin 99.(1987): 73-77. General Science Full Text (H.W. Wilson). Web. 24 Oct. 2013. Voice Gundlach's hawks has two main calls the kek and the \\"squeal\\" which is usually associated with species of its type, Accipiter. The vocalizations for these calls are different for the sexes with variations in pitch, tempo and length. The male call is softer, clearer, and shallower with a higher peak compared to the female who makes most of the calls and whose call is at a softer pitch. Distribution and habitat Gundlach's hawk is found only in Cuba. At one point it was common to find them throughout the country, however, now they can only be found in five isolated areas. The bulk of the population exists primarily on the eastern half of the island, in the two larger population centers, with the other three smaller populations on the west side of the island. They are able to live in a variety of habitats up . These include humid, dry, and pine forests. It does not have highly specialized habitat preferences needing only forests to conceal its hunting approaches. 2010. Gundlach's Hawk (Accipiter gundlachi), Neotropical Birds Online (T. S. Schulenberg, Editor). Ithaca: Cornell Lab of Ornithology Its natural habitats are dry forests and lowland moist forests. The species was never a common sight, but its population was dispersed throughout Cuba. Status and conservation Gundlach's hawk has been classified as endangered since 1994, due to its small and fragmented population.BirdLife International 2012. Accipiter gundlachi. In: IUCN 2013. IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Version 2013.1. . The past five years however, has shown a stabilization in the hawk's population trends. Population totals in Cuba were estimated to be about 400, including 270 mature hawks. This may warrant Gundlach's hawks to be reclassified as vulnerable. Perhaps the stabilization of the population can be attributed to conservation efforts that increase awareness of the hawk and its struggles. These conservation efforts include the public campaigning of Gundlach's hawk, the education of humans on the hawk and its environmental needs. Additional surveys of Cuba to assess current population and trends of Gundlach's hawk are required to determine the condition of the hawk in regards to extinction. Threats Gundlach's hawk faces a loss of habitat due to deforestation and logging in Cuba. It not only relies on trees for nesting but also for concealment as they prey on other birds. In addition to the loss of habitat the hawk also faces persecution from farmers because of its liking for poultry. References *BirdLife Species Factsheet. *Global Raptor Information Network. 2013.

Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical dry forest, subtropical or tropical moist lowland forest, subtropical or tropical moist montane forest, and plantations. It is threatened by habitat loss within Madagascar.  Description  The Henst's goshawk is a large forest raptor with a body length of 52-62 cm. The average wingspan is between 96-100cm. There is a notable size discrepancy between males and females, with males weighing 609g on average and the larger females weighing 960-1140g on average. The body is mostly covered in a dark brownish-grey plumage that is quite indistinct while the underparts are lighter in colouration and have a barred pattern. Juvenile colouration will vary and can be distinguished by having large brown spots on the breast and belly. del Hoyo, J., Elliott, A. and Sargatal, J. (1994) Handbook of the Birds of the World. Vol. 2: New World Vultures to Guineafowl. Lynx Edicions, Barcelona. A strong distinguishing feature is a pale eye line on the contrasting dark head. The eyes and long legs of the species are yellow in colour. In flight, the Henst's goshawk will have its rounded wings and long, barred tail on display. Moreover, the pale coloured rump may be used to aid in identification of a flying individual. The goshawk will mainly hunt from a hidden perch within the forest and will rarely soar above the canopy cover. The species was first described by Hermann Shlegel a German Ornithologist in 1873.  Mimic  Henst's goshawk may be easily confused with an apparent mimic species also present in Madagascar, the Madagascar Serpent‐eagle (Eutriorchis astur). Negro JJ. 2008. Two aberrant serpent-eagles may be visual mimics of bird eating raptors. IBIS International Journal of Avian Science, 150(2): 307-314 These species may be distinguished using a few key features. The first being size: Henst's goshawk is a much larger bird. The barred pattern present on the breast of Henst's goshawk is also more distinct than that of the Madagascan Serpent eagle, which will have a more muted pattern with lighter colouration.  Taxonomy  Henst's goshawk is a species within the Genus Accipeter. This diverse group of birds mostly consists of goshawks and sparrowhaks. This group is morphologically distinct in that they lack a procoracoid foramen (a hole at the base of procoracoid bone) Olson, L.S. 1987. Variation in the Procoracoid Foramen in the Accipitridae. Rivista Italiana di Ornitologia, 57(3-4): 161-164 . This Genus lies within the Family Accipitridae and order Accipitriformes which together make up the majority of the diurnal birds of prey. There are two other Accipiter present on the island of Masagascar: France's Sparrowhawk (Accipiter francesii) Madagascan Sparrowhawk (Accipiter madagascariensis) Both of which are smaller relatives than the Henst's goshawk.  Habitat and distribution  The Henst's goshawk has a limited distribution within Madagascar due to specific habitat requirements. The preferred habitats of the Henst's goshawk are primary rainforests and occasionally secondary woodland. Due to the physical geography of Madagascar these areas are restricted to the North, West and East of the island and do not occur within the southern portion. The southern portion of the island contains more arid and dry forests not suitable for raptor foraging. Consequently, the distribution of the Henst's goshawk follows that of its preferred forest habitat and is not found in the southern portion of the island. The primary forests of Madagascar may be categorized as dry deciduous and humid evergreen, both of which are occupied by Henst's goshawk. Accipter Henstii is known as an obligate forest species meaning it relies on forested habitat. This poses a problem, since these habitats are quickly being lost due to development in the region. However, it has been spotted within Eucalyptus plantations in the region. And may use these plantations to supplement for lost habitat. Within this range, it is known to be a rare species that occurs at low densities, but present within all non- arid forests. The estimated range of occurrence is approximately 673000 km2. With a vertical range of occurrence ranging from sea level to 1800m above sea level. As a top predator, large area requirements are necessary for foraging, explaining why the species occurs at low densities.  Behaviour   Reproduction  Accipiter Henstii will form breeding pairs that are known as \\"socially monogamous\\". Gardner CJ, Jasper LD. 2014. Accipeter henstii(Shlegel,1873)(Falconiformed:Accipitridae): New distribution record from southwest Madagascar. Checklist 10(1):164-165 Therefore, breeding pairs may seem like monogamous pairs but only do so for chick rearing, and will actively seek extra pair copulations on the side. Little is known about the courtship process of Henst's other than a \\"switchbacking\\" display observed by Safford and Duckworth. Safford, R., and W. Duckworth. 1988. A wildlife survey of Marojely Nature Reserve, Madagascar. International Council for Bird Preservation Study Report no. 40. ICBP, Cambridge, UK. These displays constitute hairpin turns and aerial displays followed by a distinct breeding vocalization. Following copulation, egg-laying takes place in October- November. A preference has been noted for nest sites to occur in high stature forests near a water course. Watson RT, Thornstrom R. 1996. Breeding records and nestling predation of Henst's goshawks on Masoala Peninsula. Ostrich- Journal of African Ornithology 67:168-170 Both adults take part in constructing large, bulky nests within the main fork of trees. These nests may also be built within the aforementioned Eucalyptus plantations present on the island.The only observed clutch size has been 2 eggs with the measurements of 57.0 x 41.2 and 60.0 x 42.7 mm. Rand AL. 1936. The distribution and habits of Madagascar birds. Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History 72:143-500 Henst's appear to exhibit some sort of site fidelity, where the previous year's nest is re-used or another one is built only a couple of hundred meters away from the original.Global Raptor Information Network. 2018. Species account: Henst's goshawk Accipiter henstii. Downloaded from http://www.globalraptors.org on 11 Oct. 2018 Site fidelity is most likely explained by the specificity of preferred nest habitat to occur in old growth forests near water.  Nest predation  Although known as a climax predator within Madagascan rainforests, nest-predation has been observed within multiple Henst's goshawk populations. Following gestation, the female Goshawk will leave the nest unattended for long periods of time, while males only feed the chicks sporadically, leaving the nest vulnerable to predation events at the hands of Harrier-hawks, wereby chicks within unattended nests were quickly killed and consumed by a circling harrier-hawk on multiple occasions.  Diet  The Henst's goshawk is an adept forest predator whose diet mainly consists of medium to large sized birds and mammals. With powerful eyesight, large curved talons and a curved raptor beak it is an extremely adept predatory animal. Hunting occurs from a discrete tree perch or from low forest floor flight. Henst's goshawk will not leave the canopy cover while foraging. The preferred prey are lemurs and poultry that occur within primary forest habitat. The ability to hunt lemurs makes the Henst's goshawk an important part of the Madagascan food web. Henst's also does not exhibit a species preference and will hunt a large range of lemurs as well, ranging from 100g to 4kg. . Thereby Henst's plays an important role in maintaining population health in Lemurs by reducing the abundance of diseased and old individuals, keeping the population healthy.  Vocalizations  The basic call of the Accipiter Henstii is a loud, crackling and rapid \\"ang-ang-ang- ang...\\". These vocalizations can be heard crackling through the canopy when in flight. However, these calls are rarely heard as Henst's is a more secretive species. Except for the breeding season, when the Henst's goshawk can be very loud and vocal. They will utter a rapid succession of \\"keey-keey- keey' in order to communicate with potential breeding partners.  Conservation  An assessment by Birdlife International in 2016 has placed Accipiter Henstii as Near Threatened within the IUCN . The justification for this conservation status is the relatively small population size estimated at 1000–2,250 individuals. With that population, the number of breeding adults is estimated to be 670-1500 individuals. This population is estimated to be decreasing due to deforestation and human disturbance. Furthermore, as a forest dwelling species that occurs at low densities, a presumably large area is required for a healthy breeding population to be maintained. The species is quite sparse and elusive to most surveys and therefore accurate population measures are difficult to obtain. A more thorough investigation of the population is declined and most likely will lead to a higher threat category. Henst's goshawk occurs in several protected areas within Madagascar such as the Ranomafana National Park and the Tsingy de Bemaraha Strict Nature Reserve. Furthermore, the Madagascan Government has pledged to further protect the island’s unique biodiversity.

Manuscript of XVIII c. Syntagma Canonum is a canonical collection made in 1335 by Matthew Blastares, a Greek monk about whose life nothing certain is known. The collector aimed at reducing canon law to a handier and more accessible form than it appeared in the Nomocanon of Photius, and to give a more comprehensive presentation than the epitomes and synopses of earlier writers such as Stephen (fifth century), Aristenus (1160), Arsenius (1255), et al. The author arranged his matter in alphabetical order. He made 24 general divisions, each marked off by a letter of the Greek alphabet. These sections he subdivided into 303 titles, themselves distinguished by letters; for example, the third section contains such topics as: peri gamou (about marriage), peri gynaikon (about women), etc. The titles ordinarily treat of the civil law (nomoi politikoi), as well as ecclesiastical law. Some titles however are purely ecclesiastical, others purely civil. The church ordinances are quoted from previous collections, especially from the Nomocanon (883), while the extracts from the civil law are for the most part transcribed without any reference to their origin. The compilation soon came into general use among the clergy, and preserved its authority even under Ottoman rule. A translation into Serbian followed close upon its first publication. It even worked its way into the political life of the Serbian people through an abridgment which Serbian Emperor Dušan appended to his code of laws (1349). From this the purely ecclesiastical enactments were excluded, but the civil law contained in the Syntagma was reproduced whenever adaptable to the social condition of the people. In the sixteenth century the Syntagma Canonum was translated into Bulgarian; in the seventeenth century into Russian.

The cast also included Thilak, Cho, Thengai Seenivasan, Jayalakshmi, Sangeetha, Jaya and Mallika. Soundtrack for the film was composed by Ilaiyaraaja. The movie is a portrayal of the life of Santhanam (Rajinikanth), the eldest son of a poor widow who struggles to make ends meet. He spends the first half of his life toiling day and night to provide his younger siblings an education and spends second half watching them leading comfortable lives, while he continues his struggle for survival.

He values the present moment and wants to lead a luxurious life along with his family. He spends a lot of his earnings rather than saving. Suddenly, one day, when his eldest son is just 6 years old, he dies in a road accident after getting heavily drunk. The eldest boy, Santhanam (Rajnikanth), visits his father's boss and asks for a job. He gets a job at the printing press and learns a trade running the printing press. He also does many other odd jobs. He aspires to give his siblings the comfort that his father wanted for his family. All four children grow up and their mother dies suddenly. While Santhanam continues working in the print press, his siblings go to college. He seeks the help of his friend (Cho Ramasamy) and his boss, asking them for money as and when he requires for his siblings' studies. Santhanam and a co- worker fall in love, but she breaks off when she comes to know of his numerous debts and continuing responsibilities towards his siblings. Santhanam's sister falls in love with a rich man and Santhanam feels he needs to give a suitable dowry to get his sister married to the rich man. His younger brother advises him not to give a dowry as the groom did not ask for it and also because they cannot afford a dowry. Santhanam goes ahead with the dowry and finds he is short of money, despite help from his friend and boss. In desperation, he marries Lakshmi (Phataphat Jayalakshmi) when he is promised a sum of money. But it turns out to be a false promise. He then goes to a loan shark to obtain money. Later his sister ill treats him during his visit to their home mocking at his cheap gift to her new born baby. Santhanam's younger brother (L. I. C. Narasimhan) graduates and gets a good job. Santhanam believes that his brother will help improving their family condition. But he doesn't help out Santhanam financially and becomes selfish purchasing expensive dresses and a watch only for him. He says that Santhanam's money problems were brought onto himself. Santhanam and his brother get into quarrel and his brother leaves the home and marries his friend. Santhanam's situation gets worse with his friend Cho losing his job and his boss falling ill. The printing press is now managed by the son of his ex-boss who does not like Santhanam as he has borrowed so much money from his father. Santhanam's new boss ask him to repay the money he owed to his father or else resign his job. Santhanam loses his job and he half- heartedly attempts to get help from his well-off siblings and fails. Unable to pay rent, he, his wife and child move to a slum. Santhanam gets a job as a proof reader, his wife earns some money doing some sewing and they have another child. Santhanam develops an interest to write and completes his first novel. His friend Cho, who has also recovered, publishes it. On the day that the book is available, Santhanam's wife leaves her kids at home to go to the market. In her absence, a fire occurs in the slum area. She rushes back to save her children and is badly burnt in the fire. She dies and Santhanam gets a sum of money from an insurance policy that she had secretly taken up. His friend suggests that they produce their own newspaper and this goes well. Santhanam becomes a popular novelist, winning a writer's award and he becomes rich. His siblings also unite with him considering that he is a celebrity now other than being very rich. He is now 60 years old and he doesn't reject them, he knows though, that it was his wife who was there for him through the hard times. Santhanam's both children leave to abroad for their higher education thanks to Cho who managed his finances and the press they started with Santhanam bringing in the creative input. The movie ends with Santhanam dying in a chair looking at his wife's photo and thinking about the opportunistic behaviour of his siblings and the meaninglessness of life.

There is no noticeable difference between the plumage of mature females and males, which can only be distinguished by size. The tails are cross-barred with about three or four paler stripes, and the undersides of the wings with perhaps four or five. The legs are yellow, with large feet and talons.del Hoyo J, Elliott A, Sargatal J, editors. 2004. Handbook of the Birds of the World Vol. 2: New World Vultures to Guineafowl. Barcelona: Lynx Edicions. Black sparrowhawk nestling at about 3-4 weeks old Young chicks have mid-grey eyes and white down, but when the feathers erupt they are predominantly brown. The full plumage of juveniles is a range of browns and russets with dark streaks along the head and, more conspicuously, down the chest. Commonly there are white or light-colored spots and streaks as well, mainly on the wings. The brown plumage being a sign of immaturity, it does not attract as dangerously aggressively territorial behavior as a mature black- and-white bird would. As the young birds mature, their eyes change in color from mid-grey, through light brown, to dark red. Size The black sparrowhawk is one of the world's largest Accipiters, only the Henst's, Meyer's and northern goshawk can match or exceed its size. As is common in the genus Accipiter, male black sparrowhawks are smaller than females. Typically the weights of males lie between while that of females lies in the range.Koeslag, A.

The typical total length is about and wingspan about .Raptors of the World by Ferguson-Lees, Christie, Franklin, Mead and Burton. Houghton Mifflin (2001) As in most Accipiters, the tails are long (about ), as are the tarsi (about . The features of the black sparrowhawk (and Accipiters in general) are reflective of the necessity to fly through dense arboreal habitats, although this species does most of its hunting in open areas (usually from a concealed perch in a tree). Colour polymorphism The two different colour morphs (light and dark) exhibited by black sparrowhawks are inherited in a typical Mendelian manner, that suggests a one-locus, two-allele system in which the allele coding for the light morph is dominant. The frequency of the morphs varies gradually throughout the South African range of black sparrowhawks, with the frequency of dark morphs declining from over 80% in the Cape Peninsula to under 20% in the northeast. However, there are no differences of the morph distribution in relation to levels of urbanization. Dark morph black sparrowhawks might be more common on the Cape Peninsula due to pleiotropic properties of the genes that code for dark colouration, meaning that they code for an apparently unrelated trait. In the dark morph black sparrowhawk, those genes are also responsible for an improved blood parasite resistance compared to the light morph. The species breeds during the dry season in most parts of South Africa, but during the wet season on the Cape Peninsula, where blackflies and biting midges which transmit the haematozoan blood parasites (Leucocytozoon toddi and Haemoproteus nisi), may be more abundant. So, on the Cape Peninsula, black sparrowhawks gain a selective advantage from a dark colouration. When it comes to breeding on the Cape Peninsula, the morph combination of the parents also influences their productivity. Mixed‐pairs produce more offspring per year than pairs of the same morph, but this happens at the expense of the chicks' body condition. It has also been observed that dark morph black sparrowhawks have a higher hunting success in lower light conditions, while white morphs catch more prey in brighter conditions. This suggests, that the different morphs have a better crypsis (so that prey cannot detect them) at different light levels. Distribution and habitat Black sparrowhawks are relatively widespread and common in sub-Saharan Africa and listed as not globally threatened by CITES. Densities range from one pair per 13 square kilometers in Kenya to one pair per 38-150 square kilometers in South Africa. On the Cape Peninsula, however, in the southwestern corner of South Africa, the nest are typically only 500 m (550 yds) apart in the pine plantations and other continuous or semi-continuous belts of trees. Both subspecies are only found in sub-Saharan Africa; A. m. temminckii inhabit much of the northwestern section including Senegal, the DRCongo, and Central African Republic, while A. m. melanoleucus is found from northeastern Africa southwards to South Africa. They naturally inhabit patches of forest, rich woodlands and riverine strips extending into dry bush areas. They can be found in many areas as long as they have large trees, including mangrove forest in coastal Kenya. Especially in southern Africa, black sparrowhawks have adapted to stands of the non-indigenous eucalyptus, poplar, and pine, all of which are grown commercially and are able to grow up to taller than native trees. Their adaptability to secondary forest and cultivation (they are not uncommon around homesteads now) is one of the reasons why they are not as greatly impacted by deforestation as many African forest birds, and may actually increase in numbers where such stands have been placed in otherwise open country. They are found in elevations from sea-level to . In some areas, especially on the Cape Peninsula, these sparrowhawks face habitat competition with Egyptian geese (Alopochen aegyptiaca), an aggressive species known to steal the nests of the sparrowhawks. This results in a costly loss for the sparrowhawks after the time and energy spent building the nest and may also lead to the death of current offspring. However, sparrowhawks occasionally have more than 1 nest at a time, or they can readily build a new nest, so, in the event that one is usurped by an Egyptian goose, the pair will sometimes start breeding again in a nearby alternative nest; or they might wait until the geese have left the nest with their goslings, or they abandon breeding for that year. Urban habitats Following a south and westwards range expansion of black sparrowhawks in South Africa, they also colonised the urban and suburban areas of Cape Town where they have thrived in the 21st century, with none of the expected negative impacts on their health that might have been expected from the disturbances associated with a novel climate (from a subtropical, summer rainfall regimen to a Mediterranean, winter rainfall region), or other possible sources of stress in their newly urbanised environments. This is probably due to the abundance of prey, mainly various species of Columbidae (the wide variety of pigeons and doves) in these urban areas, and, therefore, their lack of nutritional stress. The level of urbanisation does not have a negative impact on their breeding success, either. Black sparrowhawks in more urbanised habitats are however more successful early in the season, while black sparrowhawks in less urbanised habitats perform better later in the breeding season. Behaviour Vocalizations They are mostly silent except during the breeding season.Sinclair, I, and Ryan, P. 2003. Birds of Africa: south of the Sahara. Struik Nature, Cape Town, South Africa Males make short, sharp \\"keeyp\\" contact calls when arriving with prey, to which the females respond with lower pitched \\"kek\\" sounds. Before the male arrives with food, however, the female will solicit food with loud, high pitched drawn out \\"kweeeeee-uw\\" sounds. Both sexes produce alarm calls, and characteristic mating cries. The chicks, but especially the juveniles, are very noisy, making high pitched \\"weeeeeeeeh\\" sounds, especially when soliciting food. Diet Black sparrowhawks prey primarily on mid-sized birds. Most prey is spotted from a foliage-concealed perch, which is then killed in flight during a short flying dash. Less often, they stoop or chase prey seen during low or high flight over open country or near the canopy of trees and, in some cases, may even pursue prey on foot. Although kills are often made in under a minute after the initial attack, occasionally this species may engage in a prolonged pursuit lasting several minutes.Del Hoyo, J., Elliott, A. and Sargatal, J. (1994) Handbook of the Birds of the World. Volume Two: New World Vultures to Guineafowl. Lynx Edicions, Barcelona. They have been known to scan for ant swarms in order to predate birds that are attracted to these. Most birds preyed on by this species are in the size range of . Doves are the primary prey of males, whereas females take a greater quantity of larger prey such as pigeons and francolins. They also feed on poultry found in rural villages,Louette M and Herroelen P. 2007. Comparative biology of the forest‐inhabiting hawks Accipiter spp. in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Ostrich 78(1): 21-28. which have inadvertently been made available by humans. They also often take species such as rock pigeons that have flourished due to urban growth and settlement. It is, in fact, one of the species that have been able to adapt to a changing habitat due to afforestation and urbanization by taking advantage of the increase in dove and pigeon populations. With some regularity, they prey on other raptor species, including shikra, Ovambo sparrowhawk, African goshawk and wood owl. Very occasionally, they may supplement their diet with small mammals, such as bats,Brown M (2006) Black Sparrowhawk takes a mid-meal nap. Gabar 17: 19–21. rodents and juvenile mongooses. Black sparrowhawks can carry their plucked and decapitated prey over a distance of up to , usually well above the canopy. Reproduction Accipiter melanoleucus - MHNT A. m. temminckii usually breed between August and November while A. m. melanoleucus breed between May and October. In Zambia, they breed at an intermediate time, between July and February. Black sparrowhawks in eastern Africa seemingly breed at almost any time of the year. These birds are particular about their nest sites; they prefer sites within the tree canopy to protect their offspring from adverse weather conditions and other predators. Nests have been found from high in trees, though (in rare cases) have been found on the ground between large tree trunks. However, the nests are usually not deep within the forest in order to stay within close proximity of the hunting habitat outside of the forest. The nests are made up of thousands of sticks collected by both parents and are usually lined with green eucalyptus leaves, pine needles, camphor leaves or other aromatic greenery possibly to deter carriers of diseases, such as mites and insects, due to the repelling smell of the leaves,Malan G, Parasram WA, Marshall DJ. 2002. Putative function of green lining in black sparrowhawk nests: mite‐repellent role? South African Journal of Science 98: 358‐360. though greenery is often put in place weeks before the first egg is laid. The nests can measure from in width and deep. Black sparrowhawks form monogamous pairs, though extra-pair matings are not uncommon.Martin, R.O., Koeslag, A., Curtis, O & Amar, A. (2014). Fidelity at the frontier: divorce and dispersal in a newly colonised raptor population. Animal Behaviour 93: 59-68. doi:org/10.1016/janbehav.2014.04.018 A nesting pair will mate regularly throughout the breeding season, starting during courtship and continuing till after the chicks have fledged. Once nest building or refurbishing starts the female becomes lethargic, and the male does nearly all the hunting and provisioning of the female and the chicks when they hatch. Typically, the female will lay 2-4 eggs and the pair will incubate them for about 34–38 days until they hatch. Most of the incubating is done by the female, but the male will take over after he has brought in prey. The female will then eat the food, and possibly bathe in a nearby stream, before taking over the incubation once again. This behavior persists into the brooding period, with intense brooding by the female lasting up to 21 days after which the female may also start to hunt for food, but only if the nest is left largely undisturbed by other predators. She remains the chief defender of the nest and the chicks. The newly hatched chicks are semialtricial in that they are fully covered in white down feathers but cannot leave the nest since they rely on the parents for food, warmth, and protection. After 37 to 50 days, the juveniles are fledged but the parents will continue to care for them for the next 37 to 47 days. The entire time from egg-laying to the juvenile independence can, therefore, be 20 weeks, or 5 months. Black sparrowhawks are known to attempt multiple brooding on occasions.Curtis O, Malan G, Jenkins A, Myburgh N. (2005). Multiple‐brooding in birds of prey: South African Black Sparrowhawks Accipiter melanoleucus extend the boundaries. Ibis 147: 11-16. This behavior is exceeding rare in birds of prey. The second brood may be raised in the same nest, or in a second nest nearby, where the fledglings from the first brood will continue to be fed by the parents. In the Cape Peninsula, South Africa, they are also known to build multiple nests in a season, and this behaviour is thought to be an adaptation to dealing with usurpation by Egyptian Geese. Nests are usually re-used year after year, frequently by the same pair. One nest is, in fact, known to have been used continuously for 32 years by a succession of pairs.

Description The little sparrowhawk is, as its name suggests a very small bird of prey which is also distinguished by two white spots on the underside of its central tail feathers and by a narrow white patch on the lower rump. It is sexually dimorphic and the male has dark grey upperparts, which can appear almost black, this colour extending on to the cheeks to contrast with the white throat. The underparts are white barred with fine rufous bars. The females are overall browner on the upperparts and the underpart bars are also browner and less fine than the male.

The length is ; the wingspan is , the male weighs and the female . Distribution and habitat The little sparrowhawk occurs in eastern and southern sub-Saharan Africa from Ethiopia south to the southern Democratic Republic of Congo and northern Angola, south as far as the eastern Western Cape in South Africa. The little sparrowhawk is a woodland bird which can be found in patches of woodland and scrub, typically along river valleys. In drier areas it can be found in open areas such as fynbos and grassland, also in suburban gardens. Behaviour Breeding A juvenile bird in South Africa The little sparrowhawk is a monogamous and territorial solitary nester. The male's display sees him perch with his body held parallel to the perch the sways his head from side to side. The female takes most of the responsibility of building the nest constructing a small stick platform which has a thin lining of green leaves. She typically places the nest in the main fork of a tree, favouring alien species, such as Eucalyptus, poplars, jacaranda and weeping willow. She will use old nest of a shikra or gabar goshawk rather than building her own nest. In southern Africa the one to three eggs are laid from September to December, with a peak in October. The eggs are incubated by both the male and the female for about 31–32 days, although the female will perform at least three quarters of the incubation. The male regularly brings food to the incubating female and he continues to do so as she takes responsibility for the brooding of the chicks, The male also defends the nest from any other birds which approach it and vigorously chases them away, very vigorously if the intruding bird is another bird of prey. The young fledge at about 25–27 days old, remaining on their parents' territory for up to a year. In other parts of Africa breeding has been recorded from March to April in north-eastern Africa and from October to November in western Kenya. Food The little sparrowhawk is a bird hunter, waiting in cover the pursuing prey in a short dash and capturing it in flight. The main prey is small birds up to the size of a thrush or a dove. Bats may also be caught and some prey is taken from the ground, including frogs, lizards and rodents. Larger insects and termites are also taken. Predation Phinda Game Reserve in South Africa The recorded predators of adult little sparrowhawks include the gabar goshawk (Micronisus gabar), while chicks have sometimes been predated by lizard buzzards (Kaupifalco monogrammicus). Taxonomic notes The little sparrowhawk forms a superspecies with the red-thighed sparrowhawk (Accipiter erythropus) and both species are part of the potential genus Tachyspiza which if Accipiter is accepted as paraphyletic is the name of the proposed genus for most of the species currently placed in Accipiter sensu lato.

It takes its name from the Ovamboland in northern Namibia. Description The Ovambo sparrowhawk is a small sparrowhawk with the typical broad winged, long-tailed shape of a member of the genus Accipiter. The adults have plain grey upperparts with white bars on the rump and white underparts which are finely barred with grey but with a plain white vent. The tail has three dark bars and a broad, dark subterminal band. The bill is black, contrasting with the red cere, the eyes are dark red and the legs are orange. There is a melanistic form which is all black except for the white barred flight feathers on the underwing. The juvenile is browner and may be white over the underparts and head or have a brown head and rufous underparts. Females are about 14% bigger than males, weighing in at to the males . The total length is about and the wingspan is . In flight Distribution and movements It occurs in Sub-saharan Africa and breeds mostly south of the equator. It is a localised and uncommon breeder in east Africa north as far as Ethiopia and Eritrea south to Tanzania. The main range is in southern Africa where it extends from the southern Democratic Republic of Congo to northern Namibia, Botswana, northern South Africa, Swaziland and Mozambique. In western Africa it is found from the Central African Republic in the east to the Ivory Coast in the west. Birds seen in the northern parts of the range, especially in west Africa, are probably nomadic non-breeding visitors. Habitat The Ovambo sparrowhawk generally favours the edges of drier forest, woodland and exotic plantations, moving into surrounding savanna and tall woodland with patches of open ground, such as riverine and broad- leaved woodland. In southern Africa its habitat is usually dominated by miombo (Brachystegia spp), Mahobohobo (Uapaca kirkiana) or Zambezi teak (Baikiaea plurijuga). Habits The Ovambo sparrowhawk is almost exclusively a hunter of birds mostly up to in weight but females will attack larger birds such as doves up to , it has even been recorded catching a budgerigar. Its hunting technique is more like that of a falcon rather than a typical sparrowhawk, hunting by soaring at a relatively high height and stooping on any prey spotted, the chasing it for . However, it often perches quietly within the canopy, when not hunting. The Ovambo sparrowhawk is territorial and the female does most of the nest-building, creating a platform of sticks lined with bark chips and occasionally green leaves. It is typically placed in the canopy of a tree, either a native tree or an alien tree such as eucalyptus. The eggs are laid in August to November, peaking in August and September and the clutch is between one and five eggs. The female incubates the eggs, while the male brings her food, usually 2-3 times a day. The male continues to be the sole provider of food for both the female and the chicks for 18 days after hatching, after which the female starts to hunt too. The young fledge after 33–39 days and become fully independent about a month after that. Taxonomy The Ovambo sparrowhawk is apparently closely related to the Madagascar sparrowhawk Accipiter madagascarensis and phylogenetic analysis supports these two species forming a well defined clade.

The hawk is also said to occur accidentally in Costa Rica, with the first adult being observed here in 2014 after reports of only juveniles. It may be expanding its range into Costa Rica with the increase in human-disturbed land, which this hawk appears to tolerate as a nesting habitat. Alongside rainforest, this hawk is also found in patches of riparian forest, other dense woodland and sometimes in secondary forest. The total area of its occurrence is estimated at .

Ecology Feeding Little is known about this hawk's feeding biology; although given its medium size, it is assumed to take fairly large prey.del Hoyo, J, Elliott A, Sargatal J. 1994. Handbook of the Birds of the World, vol. 2: New World Vultures to Guineafowl. Lynx Edicions, Barcelona, Spain. The majority of prey may comprise small passerines and tinamous (Tinamus sp.). A young armadillo was also once identified as a prey item brought to the nest for young. This hawk is thought to be a still hunter. Instead of hunting by soaring, it probably perches in the forest canopy to wait for a passing prey. Breeding Breeding in this secretive hawk species has been observed and described only once in the field, which occurred in southern Brazil. It appears to nest in a manner typical for Neotropical Accipiter species, although grey-bellied hawk nestlings appear to stay longer in the nest (about 49 days) compared to nestlings of other hawk species. The single nest observed in Brazil constituted a platform built in the upper branches of a Parana pine. This tree may be the preferred nesting site because of dense accumulations of branches on top which may conceal the nest from potential predatory raptors. The clutch size in this nest comprised two eggs, with only a single nestling surviving and leaving the nest 49 days post-hatching. Within a pair, the male hunts for food for the female to feed to the young; as for many other Accipiters. However, unlike in other Accipiter species, the female of the grey-bellied hawk does not bring food to the nestlings while they are growing. Threats The forest habitat of this hawk species is primarily threatened by increased deforestation in the Amazon Basin;Bird JP, Buchanan, JM, Lees, AC, Clay, RP, Develey, PF, Yépez I, Butchart, SHM. 2011. Integrating spatially explicit habitat projections into extinction risk assessments: a reassessment of Amazonian avifauna incorporating projected deforestation. Diversity and Distributions: doi: 10.1111/j.1472-4642.2011.00843.x. and the species’ patchy distribution makes it susceptible to population fragmentation. However, it does appear somewhat tolerant of habitat disturbance since it has been observed foraging and nesting in degraded habitat. Nevertheless, the population is projected to decline because of the species susceptibility to being hunted and trapped; and habitat disturbance may more likely negatively affect the population. Its rarity may also be partly attributable to competition with Micrastur forest falcons. Status The grey-bellied hawk is evaluated as Near Threatened by the IUCN. It was uplisted from Least Concern in 2012 given projected future population declines in view of ongoing deforestation in the Amazon. The overall population is estimated at 1000–10000 individuals.

It was once considered to be the same species (conspecific) as the brown goshawk of Australia and New Caledonia. It is endemic to Fiji, where it occurs on the larger islands of Viti Levu, Vanua Levu, Taveuni, Kadavu, Gau and Ovalau. It occupies a range of wooded habitats in Fiji, from natural rainforest to coconut plantations and urban gardens and parks. The Fiji goshawk ranges in size from 30–40 cm, making it medium-sized for its genus. It exhibits sexual dimorphism, with the females being larger than the males.Thiollay, J.M. (1994): Family Accipitridae (Hawks and Eagles) in del Hoyo, J.; Elliot, A. & Sargatal, J. (editors). (1994). Handbook of the Birds of the World. Volume 2: New World Vultures to Guineafowl. Lynx Edicions. It has long legs and a long tail. The plumage is unmistakable within its range, having a grey head, back, tail and wings and dull pink undersides and collar. The plumage of the juvenile is distinct from the adult, being all over brown with a highly streaked breast. The Fiji goshawk feeds on birds as large as pigeons, insects, introduced rodents and reptiles. and have also been recorded feeding on freshwater prawns from the family Palaemonidae, as well as freshwater fish. This species hunts both from perches or flying. Prey may be snatched with either a slow and stealthy glide or a quick flapping attack. Prey may be chased into cover and they will actively harass and attempt to flush concealed prey. Fiji goshawks are seasonal breeders, with the breeding season occurring between July and December. Most eggs are laid between September and October. The nest is a platform of sticks located high in a lightly vegetated tree. The typical clutch size is two to three eggs (occasionally four), of which up to two chicks are commonly fledged. Although the species is today considered to be endemic to Fiji, fossil bones attributed to this species have been found on the island of 'Eua in Tonga. The species may once have occurred in the Lau group of Fiji as well. Fiji goshawks will occasionally take chickens and are often shot. They are nevertheless common and live at high densities.

It is found in Angola, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Rwanda, South Africa, South Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.  Description  A small raptor, with a height of about 30 cm and wingspan of 72 cm, the rufous-breasted sparrowhawk is named for its distinctive rufous-coloured underparts, which can be seen both perching and in flight. It is dark grey slate-brown above, including the head, with a black bill and eyes that are yellow at all ages. In flight, the bold bars on both its wings and tail are clearly visible. Juvenile plumage ranges from the rufous-color of adults to more white, but all have feathers with dark shaft streaks on their underside. It can be differentiated from the similar Ovambo sparrowhawk (Accipiter ovampensis) by its lack of a dark patch behind the eyes or white eyebrow. Taxonomy The rufous-breasted sparrowhawk is in the family Accipitridae, and is a part of the genus Accipiter, which contains sparrowhawks, goshawks, and other small woodland hawks. Within this genus it forms a superspecies with the Eurasian sparrowhawk (A. nisus) and possibly the Madagascan sparrowhawk (A. madagascariensis) (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). Recent DNA barcoding research found it to be potentially conspecific with A. nisus, but did not support a superspecies with A. madagascariensis.  Habitat and distribution  The rufous-breasted sparrowhawk has the most restricted range of any southern African accipiter, though it has expanded with the introduction of non-native pine species. It occupies montane forest habitats from the Cape of Good Hope to the Ethiopian highlands, though locally its range is quite small and divided between forest patches.  Behavior  The rufous-breasted sparrowhawk shares many behavioral qualities with other African and European accipiters, but virtually nothing is known of its diet and nestling development.  Vocalization  Its call is a series of series of high, fast “kew” notes, with the male being higher-pitched than the female. A more drawn out “kieee-u” is made by the female to request food from the nearby male, and is adopted by the young as a begging call whenever adults are near.  Diet  Usually hunts on the wing for doves and other small birds, but may occasionally strike from a perch to feed on insects, small mammals (including batsBrown M (2007) Raptors eating bats. Gabar 18: 34–35.) and reptiles.  Reproduction  Undergoes courtship by flying very high above the nesting area and calling, and mating often occurs after the male presents the female with an offer of food. Nests are platforms built from small sticks 6-18m above the ground, and are built by snapping off sticks in flight with their talons or by breaking them with their beak. A new nest is usually built each year, though often very close to the previous nesting site. Two to four eggs are laid in September and October, and are white with red-brown blotches that coalesce in a cap. Incubation is undergone primarily by the female, while the male fetches food, which is given to her in a nearby tree. References * Ferguson-Lees, James and David A.

Description The African goshawk is a medium-sized to large Accipiter which is mainly grey and rufous with the typical broad winged and long tailed shape of its genus. The adult has grey upperparts which tend to be darker in males than in females, the underparts are whitish marked with rufous barring which is more rufous and heavier in the males. The underwing is pale rufous fading to white on some birds and the flight feathers and tail vary from sooty brown to grey with faint grey bars above, white with grey bars below. The bill is black, the cere is greenish-grey, the eyes are yellow and the legs and feet are yellow. Juveniles are brown above and boldly blotched with brown and with brown flank bars too. Females weigh , while smaller males weigh . They wingspan is for males and in females, the wingspan is 1.7 times the bird's total length. Voice It is noisy when displaying, when it makes its characteristic clicking call, like two stones being knocked together, which is made every 2–3 seconds. Distribution From the Western Cape of South Africa north to the southern Democratic Republic of Congo and through east Africa, Somalia to southern Ethiopia, including the islands of Mafia, Unguja (Zanzibar) and Pemba. Habitat The African goshawk generally occurs in forest and diverse dense woodland in both lowland and montane areas, but it can also be found in riverine and gallery forest, plantations of exotic trees, parks and large gardens. It can occur in both moist and dry forest, even in isolated patches. Habits The African goshawk typically soars above the canopy in the morning in a display flight involving slow wing beats interspersed with gliding, sometimes so high up that the only sign of the birds is its regular clicking call. Its main prey is birds up to the size of hornbills or francolins, it also feeds on mammals and lizards. It is an ambush hunter, waiting on a perch until the prey is observed then swooping down to catch it. Pairs occasionally hunt co-operatively at large congregations of prey, such as bat roosts or weaver colonies. Invertebrates are also sometimes recorded as prey. The African goshawk is territorial and the typical courtship display is performed by both sexes where they fly together in an undulated flight while calling loudly, sometimes finishing with a steep dive. The females builds the nest making a platform of sticks lined with fresh foliage, as well as pine needles, lichen and mistletoe. It is normally built on a branch away from the main trunk of a tree, as they prefer to nest within dense foliage but the nest may also be constructed on top of an old Hadeda ibis nest, They have also been recorded taking over the nest of a little sparrowhawk Accipiter minullus instead of building their own. The 1-3 eggs are laid in July–December, with a peak in September–November and are incubated mainly or solely by the female for about 35–37 days, while the male regularly brings food to her. The chicks are fed by both parents, fledging at about 30–35 days old but staying within the vicinity of the nest tree for another six weeks or so before becoming fully independent roughly 1–3 months after leaving the nest. They have been recorded as being preyed on by the black sparrowhawk Accipiter melanoleuca, the tawny eagle Aquila rapax, the Cape eagle-owl Bubo capensis, the lanner falcon Falco biarmicus and the peregrine falcon Falco peregrinus. Taxonomy It is often considered conspecific with the western subspecies group of Red-chested goshawk Accipiter toussenelii of western and central Africa in which case the West African goshawk Accipiter macroscelides split.

Distribution The bird is endemic to Madagascar where it is reasonably common in the west, the north, and the east of the island. However, it is rather uncommon in the south and on the Central Plateau. Habitat In Madagascar this species is found in most forest types, including commercial plantations of coconut and other palms. It has been recorded from sea level to in altitude. Most observation are made at the edges of forests or in clearings, it can also be seen in towns. It avoids the densest forests and the most arid or deforested areas in the south and the central plateau. Habits The Madagascar cuckoo-hawk spends a lot of the day perched while searching for insects and lizards and other small vertebrates. Chameleons and geckoes make up the majority of its diet but it also takes nestlings and larger insects such as locusts. It is most active at dawn and dusk but is apparently uncommon and rarely soars, being most often observed flying between patches of trees with its typical flight of deep flaps interspersed with glides. Breeding has been recorded in November and December when the nest was situated at the top of a tree which was 14m tall and located in an area of degraded forest adjacent to a marsh.

The nest is lined with green leaves. The female lays three to five eggs, dull white, spotted with pale yellow-brown or red-brown and a few darker freckles. There is no further information on its reproduction. The black-collared hawk lives on a diet mainly composed of fish. It also eats water bugs and occasionally lizards, snails and rodents. In the 1870s Ridgeway wrote that Busarellus (then known as Ichthyoborus) had the \\"general form and appearance of Buteogallus aequinoctialis\\", but that it \\"is much more nearly related to the heliatine groups\\", in which he included Milvus, Haliastur, and Haliaaetus. During the early-to-mid 20th century, Busarellus was conventionally placed near Buteogallus in taxonomic order. The black-collared hawk has the basal phalanges of the inner toe fused, which may be an adaptation to prevent the toe from bending back when catching prey. This feature is shared with Ictinia and with the group of true milvine kites and sea eagles (Milvus, Haliastur, Haliaaetus, and Icthyophaga). Research in molecular phylogenetics during the early 21st century indicates that there is a clear milvine–haliaetine clade that is related to a large group of buteonine hawks and their relatives. Within the buteonine group, Ictinia is near-basal, and Busarellus is a member of a clade shared with Geranospiza, Rostrhamus, and Helicolestes.

Description The adult grasshopper buzzard is grey brown above with a darker head and dark shaft streaks on all of its feathers. The feathers of the mantle and lesser coverts are narrowly with fringed rufous in fresh plumage, although this wears off. The grey tail has faint brown bars. The greater coverts and primary feathers are light rufous, the primaries are tipped with black, and form a conspicuous reddish patch in flight. The secondary feathers are rufous shading to dark brown towards the tip, which is white. The chin and throat are whitish, with three black streaks on either side of throat. The breast is rufous and has narrow shaft streaks of black, the belly and thighs are also rufous but lack markings. The axillary feathers are greyish brown, spotted with white or buff. The under wing coverts and wing lining are white. The eyes, legs, and cere are yellow. The bill has a black tip and a yellow base. The female is slightly larger than the male. Juveniles have a bright brownish-red head and nape with dark shaft streaks, and as they age, the crown becomes the same colour as the back, the tail acquires bars, and the rufous edges on the mantle and coverts become less distinct. The length of the grasshopper buzzard is ; the wingspan: and the weight is for the males and for the females. Habitat Grasshopper buzzards usually frequent woodland and forest edges, and arid acacia savannahs. It also can be found in marshes’ edges and over burnt areas. Distribution Afrotropical. Senegal and Gambia east to Ethiopia, migrating south to Sierra Leone, Cameroon, northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, and northern Tanzania. Movements The grasshopper buzzard is a partial migrant which moves south in the dry northern winter, i.e. September to March, and north again in summer with the rains, April to September to breed. In general, this species ranges between about 9-15° N when breeding, south to 5° N in the dry season, it only occurs south of the equator in eastern Africa. There is much local and even annual variation in distribution and abundance. Biology The grasshopper buzzard feeds mainly on insects although it will also take small birds, rodents and reptiles. It hunts from a low perch, looking for large insects, which are its main prey, catching them on the ground, or sometimes on the wing after a brief aerial chase. The grasshopper buzzard is quite sociable and is often seen in groups of 50 to 100 birds, most frequently in recently burnt areas where there are insect emergences. Grasshopper buzzards are specialise on catching grasshoppers during the non-breeding season and when breeding they consume a range of insects, mostly grasshoppers and beetles, also scorpions and sun spiders when breeding, but the bulk of their breeding season diet is dominated by reptiles and other vertebrates such as frogs, rodents, and birds are also regularly taken during this time. Breeding season for grasshopper buzzards is between March and May in the northern part of the range, but laying depends on the region. The nest is placed in a fork of tree, in low tree, or sometimes at about above the ground in taller trees. The nest is made with sticks, with a cup in the centre, lined with green leaves. One to three bluish-white eggs, with some dark markings, are laid. The details of the incubation and nesting behaviour are not known although fresh green leaves are added to the nest throughout the nesting period. Grasshopper buzzards occur at quite high densities with up to 3.3 nests per square kilometre and with distances between nests of less than in high-quality habitat. The home ranges overlap and birds regularly fly over neighboring territories on foraging flights. Taxonomy The grasshopper buzzard forms a superspecies with the white-eyed buzzard (Butastur teesa), rufous-winged buzzard (Butastur liventer), and grey-faced buzzard (Butastur indicus) all of which occur in Asia.

Description The red-necked buzzard is a medium-sized bird of prey with a distinctive rufous neck, the rufous colour extends up over the crown and down on to the upper back. The rest of the upperparts are mostly blackish, except for the rufous upper tail feathers which has a black subterminal bar. The underparts are mainly white, apart from a dark throat and dark blotches which extend along the flanks. Juveniles resemble the adults, but have a browner upperparts, creamy rather than white underparts and lack the dark throat. Distribution and movements The red- necked buzzard occurs in a broad band running from Mauritania south to Liberia then eastwards to Ethiopia and Uganda, as well as south along the Gulf of Guinea coast through Gabon to the Democratic Republic of Congo and north- eastern Angola. The red-necked buzzard is a partial migrant, the northern populations may be completely migrant which leave the savanna following the rains and spend the dry season to the south along the edge of the main forest zone. Habitat The red-necked buzzard prefers forest edges and clearings, including those within secondary and primary forests but it occurs in cultivated areas and is generally absent from the main areas of lowland rainforest up to an altitude of 2,500 metres. Habits The red-necked buzzard normally hunts by sitting in wait on a perch, scanning the ground for prey which is caught by a swooping dive down on to the prey. It is a generalist hunter and the prey taken consists of a wide variety of small animals including rodents, birds, lizards and snakes, as well as arthropods and especially termites. This species builds a stick nest which is situated in the upper fork of a large forest tree, on cliff ledges or on pylons, pairs will utilise same nest site in successive years. The clutch size is normally one or two eggs, which are probably laid in November to January in the northern part of its range and later in the south, where young have been seen in the nest in August.

It is a species from the widespread genus Buteo in the family Accipitridae. Description The Madagascar buzzard is a typical old-world buzzard, showing quite a lot of variability in plumage and which is similar to the forest buzzard of Africa and the palearctic common buzzard. They have a dark grey head, a white patch on the breast, the brownish -white vent and thighs are spotted with brown. The tail is marked with broad brownish-black bars. The bill is black with a greyish blue cere, the eyes are yellow and the legs and feet are pale yellow. Distribution and habitat Endemic to Madagascar where it is common, except for the deforested central plateau where it is less common, there is some indication that its population is increasing as the forest is fragmented. The Madagascar buzzard is adaptable as to its habitat and is found in a wide variety of habitats including forest, open woodland and regenerating, secondary forest. It can also be found on rocky hillsides up to 2300 metres above sea level. Although it is so adaptable it is still less common on the deforested central plateau. Habits The Madagascar buzzard has a breeding season which extends from July to November, It builds its nest in the fork of a tree, in a palm tree or on a cliff ledge, constructing it from sticks and lining it with fresh foliage. The clutch is normally made up of 1-2 eggs which the female lays spaced apart but starts incubating as soon as the first one is laid. Once the eggs hatched the older sibling usually kills the younger and only very rarely are two chicks raised to fledging. Incubation last 4–5 weeks and the fledging period is 6–7 weeks. This species is an opportunistic hunter which take a wide variety of prey including small mammals, birds, lizards, snakes, frogs, terrestrial crabs and other large arthropods. In addition, scientists observing the behaviour of lemurs, in particular the ruffed lemur and verreaux's sifaka, have recorded them making alarm calls at the sight of a Madagascar buzzard, suggesting that they may occasionally be preyed upon too.

The rufous-tailed hawk is found in southern Argentina and Chile, including the entire region of Tierra del Fuego. Its natural habitats are temperate forests, subtropical or tropical dry shrubland, subtropical or tropical high-altitude shrubland, and temperate grassland.  Description  The rufous-tailed hawk is similar to the red-tailed hawk. It was first recorded by Charles Darwin in Patagonia while on his voyage of the Beagle.Gould, J. and Darwin, C.R. (1839) Birds Part 3 No. 2 of The zoology of the voyage of H.M.S. Beagle. Smith Elder and Co, London. Available at: http://darwin-online.org.uk The rufous-tailed hawk is a medium-sized hawk with a wing span of 45–60 cm. The overall size range of the hawk is 54–60 cm. There are two different colorations of the rufous-tailed hawk. The more common pale version of the hawk has a blackish brown upper parts, with a darker cap and cinnamon feathers along the side of the head and neck. The belly is white with dark markings and reddish brown coloration on it.Ferguson-Lees, J. and Christie, D.A. (2001) Raptors of the World: An Identification Guide to the Birds of Prey of the World. Houghton Mifflin, New York. The dark version is basically all black with whitish edging on the feathers. The call of the rufous-tailed hawk sounds like kee-ahrr.  Habitat  The rufous-tailed hawk has been spotted living in a number of different habitat types, including evergreen beech forest,Gelain, M. A. & Trejo, A. (2001) Nuevos registros del Aguilucho Cola Rojiza (Buteo ventralis) en la Patagonia Argentina. Hornero 16: 97–99. mature forest and new growth forest that have been burned over,Blake, E.R. 1977. Manual of Neotropical birds. Vol. 1. Spheniscidae (penguins) to Laridae (gulls and terns). University of Chicago Press, Chicago, IL. and finally in open country.Venegas and Jory (1979), cited in The best theory for their ideal habitat was developed by Figueroa et al. (2000),Figueroa, R., J.E. Jiménez, C.E. Bravo, E.S. Corales. 2000. The diet of the Hawk (Buteo ventralis) during the breeding season in southern Chile. Ornitologia Neotropical Trejo et al. (2006), and Rivas et al. (2009), who all suggested that rufous-tailed hawks' ideal habitat is somewhere with high trees near open areas that are good for hunting for prey. So far, there have been no reports of the rufous-tailed hawk living in human areas like cities or abandoned buildings.  Feeding  The rufous-tailed hawk feeds on a large variety of prey. They feed on everything from other birds to mammals and reptiles. This shows that rufous-tailed hawks have a very broad diet that is similar to the red-tailed hawk. Figueroa et al. (2000) reported the rufous-tailed hawk feeding on southern lapwing, Norwegian rat, European hare, red-breasted meadowlark, Chilean flicker, short-tailed snake, and even a few unidentified beetles. Feeding or prey capture was also recorded to happen in forest and in parries.  Breeding  Rufous-tailed hawks have a longer recorded nestling period compared to other species of Buteo.Norambuena, H. V., V. Raimilla, and J. E. Jimenez. 2012. Breeding behavior of a pair of Rufous-tailed Hawks (Buteo ventralis) in southern Chile. Journal of Raptor Research 46:211-215. Rufous- tailed and red-tailed hawks have around the same nestling periods: around 49 days for rufous-tailed hawks compared to 45–46 days for red-tailed hawks.Fitch, H. S., Swenson, and Tillotson. 1946. Behavior and food habits of the Red-tailed hawk. Condor 48:205–237 The egg clutch size of a rufous-tailed hawk has only been reported to between 1-3 eggs in a nest.Rivas-Fuenzalida, T., J. Medel, and R. A. Figueroa. 2011. Reproducción del aguilucho colarojiza (Buteo ventralis) en remanentes de bosque lluvioso templado de la Araucanía, sur de Chile. Ornitología Neotropical 22:405–420  Threats  Rufous-tailed hawks are threatened by many factors, especially habitat loss. Rufous-tailed hawks have been losing their habitat because of logging, over grazing by sheep and cattle, and the growth of Pinus and Eucalyptus plantations. Pinus radiata and Eucalyptus globulus are fast-growing invasive plants that were introduced in order to spur the timber industry in Chile. The other main threat to rufous-tailed hawks are local people, who sometimes kill these birds because rufous-tailed hawks attack and eat their domesticated animals.  Population estimates  Ferguson-Lees and Christie (2001) estimated the population size to be around 100 individuals. In 2001, the IUCN ranked them at only \\"low risk\\". They were only listed as \\"vulnerable\\" in 2015 because the IUCN estimated the population to be around 299-999 mature individuals and a total of around 375-1499 individuals. If the total number of individuals drops lower than 1000, then they will be designated as \\"endangered\\" by the IUCN. But a more accurate and current population estimate is still need to get a better understanding of what danger the rufous-tailed hawk is truly in.

All members of this genus are essentially neotropical, but the distribution of a single species extends slightly into the extreme southwestern United States. Many of the species are fond of large crustaceans and even patrol long stretches of shore or riverbank on foot where such prey abounds, but some have a rather different lifestyle. Unlike many other genera of raptor, some members are referred to as \\"hawks\\", and others as \\"eagles\\". Most of the species have a characteristic tail pattern. This consists of a black base, a wide white middle band, a wide black band, and a quite narrow white band on the feathertips that is often hard to discern or may be lost when the feathers are very worn. Only the white-necked hawk and the rufous crab hawk have a very different tail patterns (see also below). Systematics and taxonomy This genus contains the following extant species, ordered according to putative relatedness: * Slate-colored hawk Buteogallus schistaceus * White-necked hawk Buteogallus lacernulatus * Rufous crab hawk, Buteogallus aequinoctialis * Common black hawk, Buteogallus anthracinus ** Mangrove black hawk, Buteogallus (anthracinus) subtilis – formerly considered a distinct species, but now considered a subspecies. * Cuban black hawk, Buteogallus gundlachii – formerly included in B. anthracinus * Great black hawk, Buteogallus urubitinga * Savanna hawk, Buteogallus meridionalis * Chaco eagle, Buteogallus coronatus * Solitary eagle, Buteogallus solitarius The solitary eagles (formerly Harpyhaliaetus) are a more inland relative of the \\"black\\" group of Buteogallus – in phenotype they are essentially hefty common black-hawks with lighter body plumage and in one species a small crest. Insofar as there are differences in anatomy, these seem to be related to the different prey they hunt (namely reptiles). Together with the savanna hawk, they seem to be close to some species that were uncomfortably placed in Leucopternis. As that genus was apparently polyphyletic, the present article follows a proposal to unite the solitary eagles as well as the slate-colored hawk (\\"Leucopternis\\" schistaceus) with Buteogallus, to agree with the morphological and mtDNA sequence data., with the addition of the white-necked hawk, \\"Leucopternis\\" lacernulatus. For a long time various systematists have proposed moving the slate-colored hawk to Buteogallus. Together with the crab hawks and solitary eagles form a sequence of plumage patterns that nicely agrees with the DNA-based phylogeny: the slate-colored hawk looks very much like a smaller, shorter-legged and lighter common black hawk. The case of the white-necked hawk is more puzzling. It is visually and ecologically almost identical to the sympatric mantled hawk (Leucopternis polionotus) and some allopatric white hawks (L. albicollis) but differs in tail color. According to the mtDNA data, it is very closely related to the savanna hawk, which is visually dissimilar, appearing like a very light Buteogallus which has an ochre-grey coloration due to abundant pheomelanins. Either there has been strong convergent evolution in plumage and ecology - perhaps a case of mimicry - between the white-necked and the mantled hawks, or the mtDNA data is misleading due to ancient hybrid introgression. In the respect, the white-necked hawk specimen sampled showed indications of heteroplasmy. The placement of the peculiarly apomorphic rufous crab hawk in regard to all these birds must be considered unresolved for the time being. Fossil record Buteogallus fragilis fossil The fossil record of Buteogallus has meanwhile turned out to be quite rich indeed, with many species being erroneously assigned to other genera at first. The genus – like many buteonines of today – probably succeeded earlier birds of prey during the Miocene and never seems to have occurred outside the Americas. From the time of the last ice age, an array of prehistoric species is known, some of them very large. On Cuba, a particularly gigantic species survived deep into the last ice age, but probably not until human settlement. *†Buteogallus enectus (Middle Miocene; Sheep Creek, Sioux County, USA) *†Buteogallus sodalis (Middle Pleistocene; Fossil Lake, Oregon) – formerly in Aquila *†Buteogallus fragilis (Late Pleistocene; Southwestern USA) – formerly in Buteo or Geranoaetus *†Buteogallus milleri (Late Pleistocene of Southwestern, USA) – formerly in Buteo or Geranoaetus *†Buteogallus royi (Late Pleistocene of Cuba) *†Buteogallus borrasi (prehistoric) – formerly in Aquila or Titanohierax *†Buteogallus daggetti (prehistoric) References Category:Hawks Category:Bird genera Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Buteogallus"},{"id":"12418574","text":"The scissor-tailed kite (Chelictinia riocourii), also known as African swallow-tailed kite or fork-tailed kite, is a bird of prey in the monotypic genus Chelictinia in the family Accipitridae. It is widespread in the northern tropics of Africa. Taxonomy and systematics The species was illustrated in 1821 for a work by Coenraad Temminck, and described in 1822 by Louis Vieillot. It had been grouped with the Elanus kites or with the larger American swallow- tailed kite; in 1843 René Lesson assigned it to a separate genus, Chelictinia. The genus name Chelictinia is possibly derived from Greek χελιδών or χελιδονι (chelidon), the swallow, with ικτινοσ (iktinos), the kite. The specific epithet riocourii honours the Count Rioucour, Antoine François du Bois \\"first president in the Royal Court of Nancy, and possessor of a beautiful collection of birds\\". The surname du Boys is also written as du Bois or Dubois. However, some sources refer to his son, Antoine Nicolas François, who was a contemporary of Vieillot., Description The scissor-tailed kite is a small, slim grey and white kite with a relatively weak bill, a broad head, long pointed wings and a deeply forked tail. The adults are generally pale grey above and white below, with a white forehead and a black patch around the eyes. In flight the dark greyish flight feathers contrast with the inner underwing edges, there is also an obvious black bar across the carpal. Juveniles are darker on the back with rufous edges to the feathers and creamier below. It has a distinctive almost tern like flight and frequently hovers into the wind like a kestrel. The red eyes of the adult are also a distinctive feature. Distribution and habitat The species inhabits the arid savannah of the Sahel region of Africa, occurring mainly in a band between 8° and 15° N that stretches from Senegal on the west coast to Sudan in the east. There are also populations breeding in Ethiopia and Kenya.\\" It is found in many countries, including: Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Ivory Coast, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Somalia, Sudan, Togo, Uganda, and is also found in Yemen. Behaviour and ecology When breeding the scissor-tailed kite feeds mainly on skinks and other lizards, as well as small snakes, rodents and arthropods. Usually hunts on the wing, dropping onto prey but does catch prey in flight, especially insects flushed by grass fires. When termites emerge or locust swarms there may be gatherings of scissor-tailed kites. Loose flocks have been known to associate with cattle, flying over the beasts and hawking any insects they flush. They breed in loose colonies of up to 20 pairs, although will do so as single pairs, mainly on May to August but breeds in December to February in the west and March- June or August in Kenya. A small stick nest is built an acacia or thorny bush at 2-8m from the ground. The nest is often sited close to the nest of a large raptor such as a secretary bird or a brown snake eagle, occasionally close to buildings. Status The species is vulnerable to degradation of the habitat and pesticides. However, populations seem to be locally common in spite of decline in some parts of the range.

It is found in West, East and southern Africa. This species is an almost obligate predator of a variety of snakes. A very solitary bird, the brown snake eagle has a prolonged breeding cycle and raises a single eaglet. Although probably naturally scarce, it is classified as a Least concern species as it continues to occur over a very broad range. Distribution and habitat This species is distributed widely in Africa. In west Africa, ranges from southeastern Mauritania, Senegal, The Gambia, Guinea- Bissau, eastern and western Guinea, Sierra Leone, the northern, inland parts of Liberia, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Togo, Benin, Nigeria as well as inland in Mali and Niger. From there they range across to southern Chad, southern Sudan, South Sudan, inland in Eritrea and northern Ethiopia and central Ethiopia and in southern Somalia through much of Kenya, Uganda and the southern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo down through southern Africa to about half of Namibia, all of Botswana and Zimbabwe and northeastern and eastern South Africa. Although it is not migratory, brown snake eagles may be somewhat nomadic, with cases of birds on territories stretching up to apart. Furthermore, ringed birds have been known to travel away (from South Africa to the Democratic Republic of the Congo). This species dwell in open woods and wooded savanna, most often preferring areas where gulley or wooded hillocks break up flat areas, apparently preferring somewhat more densely wooded areas than related snake eagles.Brown, L.

Description  Kang in central Botswana Brown snake eagle hydrating after a drink in Yankari National Park, Bauchi, Nigeria Their plumage about the body is entirely a fairly dark brown, with some claims of a purplish sheen in certain light conditions. The body colour extends to the wings but for their contrasting unmarked flight feathers which are whitish-grey. The shortish tail, which is most easily seen in flight, is at all ages barred brown and grayish cream. The juvenile is similar in appearance and colour but tends to have very sparse white feather bases, with birds from south of the range apparently showing heavier white speckling, especially on the abdomen and head. Steyn, P. (1983). Birds of prey of southern Africa: Their identification and life histories. Croom Helm, Beckenham (UK). 1983. This species has a large head and bare legs, which serve to distinguish it from other brownish medium-sized eagles in Africa, although a juvenile bateleur could be confused with one in poor light, but its colour is more varying, its eyes brown and the species has a shorter tail and shorter legs. The brown snake eagle is of medium size relative to species referred to as eagles, however it is the largest member of the Circaetus genus.

The birds of Zimbabwe. Salisbury: Quest Publishing. Even more impressive accounts are known of this species hunting adult black mambas, including specimens measuring up to at least . Hunting is typically from a tree perch or hillock, but also rarely sometimes from flight, and taken almost exclusively on the ground. Like most snake eagles, they quite often swallow their prey whole (though particularly large snakes are torn apart), but seldom do so in flight as do other snake eagles. Alternate prey is known to have included monitor lizards, toads, francolins, guineafowl and chickens as well as rats and perhaps other mammals. This species is solitary and even the breeding pair is rarely seen in the same place at any point of the year. Males do almost all known territorial display flights, which sometimes escalate from typical soaring into butterfly-like erratic flight movements and, if escalated, into interlocking of talons and cartwheeling. Breeding takes places in November to July in northern part of range and, although potentially in nearly any month, mainly December-July in Zimbabwe and February-October in Kenya. The nests are relatively small, usually about across and deep, often being on flat-topped trees such as Acacia or Euphorbia at above the ground. Sometimes the nests are infrequently on top of epiphytes, buffalo-weaver nests or on electric pylons. Old nests are other raptors are not infrequently used, from tawny eagle to gymnogene nests, and are frequently perceptibly bulkier than those built by snake eagles themselves. A single egg clutch is laid and is incubated mainly by the female for approximately 50 days (quite long for an eagle of this size).Tarboton, D. G. (1984). The status and conservation of birds of prey in the Transvaal. Transvaal Museum Monographs, 3(1). Like most birds of prey, the female largely takes on brooding and the male food deliveries. In this species, the male often arrives with a snake hanging from his mouth with only the tail extending from his throat, the female then pulls it out of his bill and throat, thereafter she tears the prey into appropriately sized bites for the single eaglet. The juvenile eagles stay around the nest for 60–100 days before exploring branches along the perimeter, until they fledge at 97-113 (mean of about 109) days. The juvenile brown snake eagle is completely independent a few weeks after fledging. Though the young eagle may continue to beg the adults, the parents soon lose interest in feeding the young eagle. Typical lifespan in this species is around 7–10 years, fairly short for an eagle. This species is somewhat scarce and is possibly declining overall per the IUCN but it is persisting fairly strongly over a large range, that includes 23.3 thousand square kilometers. It is therefore at least concern status for immediate conservation attention.

Description The Southern banded snake eagle is a rather small, stocky snake eagle with a large, rounded head which has a hooded beak. It has a grey- brown head contrasting slightly with the mainly blackish-brown upperparts and whitish underparts. The tail has a white tip and shows three distinct dark bands on the underside. The large eyes are pale yellow eyes, the feet and cere are yellow and the bill us black. The juvenile lacks the grey head, has mainly dark upperparts and the whitish pale underparts are marked with dark streaks on the face, throat and upper breast. The total length varies from 55–60 cm with females larger than males. Voice The Southern banded snake eagle is unobtrusive and is normally found due to its noisy, high-pitched call, \\"ko-ko- ko-kaw\\", repeatedly made either from a perch or while in flight. Distribution The Southern banded snake eagle occurs in a narrow band along the east African coast from southern Somalia to the north eastern Kwazulu- Natal and inland along the Save River into south eastern Zimbabwe. Habitat The southern banded snake-eagle is a forest species and it mainly occurs in evergreen coastal forest but also in dense inland forests close to wetlands, it is occasionally recorded from more open areas of woodland. Biology As its name suggests the Southern banded snake eagle mainly eats snakes, hunting from a perch, scanning the surroundings for prey. If a large snake is caught, it is torn up into bite-size pieces before feeding, however smaller snakes are swallowed whole, head-first. It has also been recorded feeding on lizards, frogs and termite alates. The nest is constructed by both sexes and is an open platform of small sticks roughly 50–70 cm wide with an inner cup which is 17 cm across and is lined with fresh foliage. The nest is normally placed in the main fork of a tree. The single egg is laid from August–October and is mainly incubated by the female for about 50 days, although the male may take over for short stints early on in the incubation period. Both parents feed the young on a diet of ripped up snakes. At first the male does the majority of the hunting, while the female looks after the nestling.

It is located in the Olympus Range on the border between Thessaly and Macedonia, between the regional units of Pieria and Larissa, about southwest from Thessaloniki. Mount Olympus has 52 peaks and deep gorges. The highest peak, Mytikas (Μύτικας Mýtikas), meaning \\"nose\\", rises to . It is one of the highest peaks in Europe in terms of topographic prominence. Olympus is notable in Greek mythology as the home of the Greek gods, on Mytikas peak. It is also noted for its exceptional biodiversity and rich flora. It has been a National Park, the first in Greece, since 1938. It is also a World Biosphere Reserve. Every year, thousands of visitors admire its fauna and flora, tour its slopes, and climb its peaks. Organized mountain refuges and various mountaineering and climbing routes are available. The usual starting point for climbing Olympus is the town of Litochoro, on the eastern foothills of the mountain, from Thessaloniki.  Geography  Mytikas: the highest peak The shape of Olympus was formed by rain and wind, which produced an isolated tower almost above the sea, which is only away at Litochoro. Olympus has many peaks and an almost circular shape. The mountain has a circumference of , an average diameter of , and of area. To the northwest lies the Vlach village of Kokkinoplou. The Makryrema stream separates Olympus from the massif of Voulgara. The villages Petra, Vrontou and Dion lie to the northwest, while on the eastern side there is the town of Litochoro, where Enipeas bisects the massif of Olympus. On its southeastern side, the Ziliana gorge divides Mount Olympus from Kato Olympos (Lower Olympus), while on its southwestern foothills, there are the villages Sykaminea and Karya. The Agia Triada Sparmou Monastery and the village Pythion lie to the west. Olympus' dry foothills, known as the Xirokampi, are covered in chaparral and provides habitat for animals such as wild boar. Further east, the plain of Dion is fertile and watered by the streams which originate on Olympus.  Geology  Mount Olympus is formed of sedimentary rock laid down 200 million years ago in a shallow sea. Various geological events that followed caused the emergence of the whole region and the sea. Around one million years ago glaciers covered Olympus and created its plateaus and depressions. With the temperature rise that followed, the ice melted and the streams that were created swept away large quantities of crushed rock in the lowest places, forming the alluvial fans, that spread out all over the region from the foothills of the mountain to the sea. The Geological Museum of Mount Olympus, located in Leptokarya, provides detailed information about the geological structure of the mountain.  Morphology  Stratospheric view of Mount Olympus The complicated geological past of the region is obvious from the morphology of Olympus and its National Park. Features include deep gorges and dozens of smooth peaks, many of them in altitude of more than , including Aghios Antonios (), Kalogeros (), Toumpa () and Profitis Ilias (). However, it is the central, almost vertical, rocky peaks, that impress the visitor. Over the town of Litochoro, on the horizon, the relief of the mountain displays an apparent V, between two peaks of almost equal height. The left limb is the peak named Mytikas (or Pantheon). It is Greece's highest peak. Then, on the right is Stefani (or Thronos Dios [Throne of Zeus]), which presents the most impressive and steep peak of Olympus, with its last sharply rising 200 meters presenting the greatest challenge for climbers. Further south, Skolio ( second highest sub-peak – ) completes an arc of about 200 degrees, with its steep slopes forming on the west side, like a wall, an impressive precipitous amphitheatrical cavity, in depth and in circumference, the 'Megala Kazania'. On the east side of the high peaks the steep slopes form zone like parallel folds, the 'Zonaria'. Even narrower and steeper scorings, the 'Loukia', lead to the peak. Οn the north side, between Stefani and Profitis Ilias, extends the Muses' Plateau, at , while further south, almost in the center of the massif, extends the alpine tundra region of Bara, at an altitude of . Olympus has numerous ravines and gullies. Most distinguishable of the ravines are those of Mavrologos-Enipeas (14 km) and Mavratzas-Sparmos (13 km) near Bara and 'cut' the massif in two oval portions. On the southern foothills the great gorge of Ziliana, 13 km long, consists of a natural limit that separates the mountain from Lower Olympus. There are also many precipices and a number of caves, even nowadays unexplored. The form and layout of the rocks favor the emergence of numerous springs, mainly lower than 2,000 m, of small seasonal lakes and streams and of a small river, Enipeas, with its springs in the site Prionia and its estuary in the Aegean Sea.Arne Strid. Wild Flowers of Mount Olympos, Introduction, p. ix.  Name and mythological associations  Muses' Plateau, with Stefani (the throne of Zeus) in the background The origin of the name Όλυμπος Olumpos is unknown and usually considered of \\"pre-Greek\\" origin. In Homeric Greek (Odyssey 6.42), the variant Οὔλυμπος Oulumpos occurs, conceived of as the seat of the gods (and not identified with any specific peak). Homer (Iliad 5.754, Odyssey 20.103) also appears to be using οὔλυμπος as a common noun, as a synonym of οὐρανός ouranos \\"sky\\". Mount Olympus was historically also known as Mount Belus, after Iliad 1.591, where the seat of the gods is referred to as βηλ[ός] θεσπεσίο[ς] \\"heavenly threshold\\". In Ancient Greek religion and mythology, \\"Olympus\\" was the name of the home of the Twelve Olympian gods. This was conceived of as a lofty mountaintop, and in all regions settled by Greek tribes, the highest local elevation tended to be so named; among the numerous peaks called Olumpos in antiquity are mountains in Mysia, Laconia, Lycia, Cyprus, Attica, Euboea, Ionia and Lesbos, and others. Thessalian Olympus is the highest peak in any territory with Greek settlement and came to be seen as the \\"Pan-Hellenic\\" representative of the mythological seat of the gods, by at least the 5th century BC, as Herodotus (1.56) identifies Olympus as the peak in Thessaly. In Pieria, at Olympus's northern foot, the mythological tradition had placed the nine Muses, patrons of the Fine Arts, daughters of Zeus and the Titanide Mnemosyne.  History  In antiquity, the Olympus massif forms the border between Thessaly and Macedon. The history of the surrounding area is consequently of interest in the context of the Rise of Macedon, the Chremonidean War and the Macedonian Wars during the 4th to 2nd centuries BC. In the period of the Ottoman Empire the mountain was a hiding place and base of operations for klephts and armatoloi. It was known as Semavatevi in Turkish during the nearly 500 years of Ottoman rule. In Olympus, the second armatoliki was founded, led by Kara Michalis in 1489. The action of the klephts in Olympus led the Turks to visit their outrage on the klephts' ally-village of Milia (in the late 17th century), which they destroyed. In that period Livadi in Olympus became the seat of the armatoliki of Olympus and Western Macedonia, with their first renowned commander Panos Zidros. In the 18th century the Turks had to replace the armatoloi (who very often joined the klephts) with Moslem Albanian armatoloi who ravaged the countryside of Macedonia. However, Olympus' armatoloi, even after their capitulation to Ali Pasha, never ceased fighting on land and at sea. Among them who were active there and in nearby regions were Nikotsaras, Giorgakis Olympios and the legendary family of Lazaioi. In the early 20th century, even for some time after the liberation from the Ottoman Empire (1912), robbers were active in the region – the best known of them the notorious Giagoulas, while during the German invasion in 1941 the Greek army fought significant battles along with units of New Zealanders and Australians. During the German Occupation (1941–1944) the mountain was one of the centers of the Greek Resistance, while a little later the Greek Civil War (1946–49) started there, in Litochoro.  Ancient and medieval sites  Mount Olympus as seen from north at Petra, Pieria The whole region of Pieria's Olympus was declared archaeological and historical site for the preservation of its monumental and historical character. Five km away from the sea is Dion, sacred city of the ancient Macedons, dedicated to Zeus and the Twelve Olympians. Its prosperity lasted from the 5th century BC to the 5th century AD. The excavations, continuing since 1928, have revealed numerous findings of the Macedonian, the Hellenistic and the Roman period. Currently there is a unique archaeological park of 200 hectares, with the ancient town and the sacred places of worship, outside its walls. Many statues and other invaluable items are kept in the nearby Dion's archaeological museum.Hellenic Republic, Ministry of culture and sports, Onassis Foundation US, 2016: Gods and Mortals at Olympus. Edited by Dimitrios Pandermalis, Pimblia and Leivithra, two other towns in Olympus' region, are related to Orpheus and the \\"Orphic\\" mysteries. According to a tradition Orpheus, son of Apollo and Calliope (one of the Muses), taught here the mystic ceremonies of worship of Dionysus (also known as Bacchus). By the sea, in a strategic position, at Macedonia's gates is located Platamon Castle, built between 7th and 10th century AD in the ancient town of Heracleia. To the north the ancient Pydna is located. Here, in 168 BC, the decisive battle between the Macedonians and the Romans took place. Between Pydna and Mount Olympus are a fortified bishop's seat from the Byzantine period called Louloudies and the Macedonian Tombs of Katerini and Korinos.  Christian monuments  Monastery Kanalon In the Olympus region, there are also several Christian monuments, among them the highest-altitude chapel of Orthodox Christianity, dedicated to Prophet Elias, in Greek tradition associated with mountaintops, on the summit of the same name (Προφήτης Ηλίας Profitis Ilias), at 2,803 m. It was built in the 16th century by Saint Dionysios of Olympus, who also founded the most significant monastery in the region. The Old Monastery of Dionysios (altitude 820 m) lies in Enipeas' gorge and is accessible by car from Litochoro. It was looted and burned by the Ottomans and in 1943 it was destroyed by the German invaders, who suspected it was a guerrilla den. Nowadays it has been partially restored and operates as a dependency of the New Monastery of Dionysios, that is outside Litochoro. On Olympus' southern foot, in a dominant position (820 m) in Ziliana gorge, there is the Kanalon Monastery, 8 km away from Karya. It was founded in 1055 by the monks Damianos and Joakim and since 2001 it has been restored and operates as a convent. Further west, in the edge of Mavratza stream, at 1,020 m, there is the Agia Triada Sparmou Monastery, that flourished in the early 18th century, possessed great property and assisted to establish the famous Tsaritsani' school. It was abandoned in 1932, but in 2000 it was completely renovated and reopened as a male monastery, affiliated to Elassona's diocese.  Climbing expeditions  The third highest peak of Mt Olympus, called Agios Antonios (Άγιος Αντώνιος \\"Saint Anthony\\", , 2,817 m), is known to have been the site of a sanctuary of Zeus in antiquity based on archaeological finds discovered in 1961. In the modern era, a series of explorers tried to study the mountain and to reach its summit. Examples include the French archaeologist Leon Heuzey (1855), the German explorer Heinrich Barth (1862), and the German engineer Edward Richter. Richter tried to reach the summit in 1911 but was abducted by klephts, who also killed the Ottoman gendarmes that accompanied him. It was just one year after the liberation of northern Greece from Ottoman rule, on 2 August 1913, that the summit of Olympus was finally reached. The Swiss Frédéric Boissonnas and Daniel Baud-Bovy, aided by a hunter of wild goats from Litochoro, Christos Kakkalos, were the first to reach Greece's highest peak. Kakkalos, who had much experience climbing Olympus, was the first of the three to climb Mytikas. Afterwards, and till his death in 1976, he was the official guide on Olympus. In 1921, he and Marcel Kurz reached the second highest summit of Olympus, Stefani. Based on these explorations, Kurz in 1923 edited Le Mont Olympe, a book that includes the first detailed map of the summits. In 1928, the painter Vasilis Ithakisios climbed Olympus together with Kakalos, reaching a cave that he named Shelter of the Muses, and he spent many summers painting views of the mountain. Olympus was later photographed and mapped in detail by others, and a series of successful climbs and winter ascents of the steepest summits in difficult weather conditions took place. Climbing Mount Olympus is a non-technical hike, except for the final section from the Skala summit to the Mytikas peak, which is a YDS class 3 rock scramble. It is estimated that 10,000 people climb Mount Olympus each year, most of them reaching only the Skolio summit. Most climbs of Mount Olympus start from the town of Litochoro, which took the name City of Gods because of its location at the foot of the mountain. From there a road goes to Prionia, where the hike begins at the bottom of the mountain.  Climate  Christos Kakalos refuge and Profitis Ilias peak Generally speaking Olympus' climate can be described as one of Mediterranean type with continental influence. Its local variations are the result of the impact of the sea and the rugged relief of the region. In the lower locations (Litochoro and the foothills) the climate is typically Mediterranean, i.e. hot and dry in the summer, while humid and cold in the winter. Higher it is more humid and severe, with more intense phenomena; in these locations it often snows all over the winter, while raining and snowing is not unusual, even in the summer. The temperature varies in the winter from −10 °C to 10 °C and in the summer from 0 °C to 20 °C, while winds are an almost everyday occurrence. Generally the temperature falls 1 °C per 200 m of altitude. As the altitude rises, the phenomena are more intense and the variations of temperature and humidity are often sudden. The coastal northeast slopes of Olympus receive more rain than the continental northwest, so, as a result, there is a clear difference in vegetation, being more abundant in the first of them. Hottest month is August, while coldest is February. The mountain's highest zone, over 2,000 metres, is snowcapped for about nine months (September to May). In some places the winds gather snow, 8–10 metres thick (anemosouria in Greek), while in some deep ravines the snow is maintained all over the year (everlasting snow). For this Olympus' alpine region, recordings have been made in the 1960s in the highest-altitude weather station in Greece, that was established on the summit of Aghios Antonios (2,815 m), providing a number of interesting data for the mountain's climate. The average temperature is −5 °C in winter and 10 °C in summer. The average annual precipitation heights vary from 149 cm at Prionia (1,100 m) to 170 cm at Aghios Antonios, about half of them rainfall and hailstorms in summer and the rest snowfall in winter. The weather may change several times in the same day. In summer rainfalls are frequent, commonly as evening thunderstorms, many times accompanied by hail and strong winds. However water springs over 2,000 metres are scarce and visitors should ensure that they have always water and of course the necessary clothing for any weather conditions.  Flora  Beech forest along the path from Prionia to Spilios Agapitos refuge The research of Olympus' plants started in 1836, when the French botanist Aucher-Éloy studied them. According to this and later studies, the National Park of Olympus is considered one of the richest flora regions in Greece, with about 1,700 species and subspecies, that represent some 25% of Greek flora. Of them 187 are characterized as significant, 56 are Greek endemic and of them 23 are local endemic, i.e. they can be found only in Olympus, and 16 are rare in Greece or/and have there the limits of their spread within Northern Greece. An important book about the plants and flowers, from the beach of the Aegean Sea up to the upper regions of Mount Olympus, was written in 1980 by the Swedish botanist Arne Strid. Most of those found in lower altitude are the common Mediterranean and central European species. Jankaea heldreichii, a plant relict of the Ice age, is of particular interest to botanists. The intense diversity of the landscape, the varying orientation of the slopes and their position in relation to the sea affect locally Olympus' climate and so a local microclimate prevails, combined with the geological background and the soil favor the growth of particular vegetation types and biotopes. Generally Olympus' northeast side is densely forested, as it receives the most rainfall, while the southwest one has significantly sparser vegetation. Moreover, there is a clear sequence of the vegetation zones in accordance to altitude, in Olympus there is no such a regularity. It is due to the great microclimate variety, caused by the region's landscape.  Flora zones  In Olympus there are generally four sequent flora zones, but not clearly separated:  Mediterranean vegetation zone  In the altitude between 300 and 500 metres occurs the evergreen broadleaf trees' zone (maquis). Along with oak (Quercus ilex) and Greek strawberry tree there occur kermes oak, strawberry tree, Phillyrea latifolia, bay laurel, cedar and others. Of the deciduous species most common are Fraxinus, Ulmus, Montpellier maple, Judas tree, terebinth, Cotinus coggygria and others.  Forest zone of beech, fir and mountain coniferous  The evergreen broadleaf trees' zone is gradually replaced by ecosystems of European black pine, that forms compact clusters, with no intermediate zone of deciduous oaks, although trees of these species occur sporadically within clusters of black pine. On the northern slopes of Xirolakos valley, at altitude between 600 and 700 metres, there is a high forest of downy oak of about 120 hectares. The black pine dominates on the eastern and northern side of the mountain, between 500 and 1,700 metres. In this zone there is also hybrid fir in small groups and scrubs or small clumps, particularly in the lower region and in the sites Naoumi (west) and Stalamatia and Polykastro (east), where it is mixed with black pine and Bosnian pine. In this zone there is also beech. While in the neighboring mountains Pierians and Ossa it creates an extended vegetation zone, in Olympus it is restricted to small clusters, appearing as islets, mainly in more humid locations and the best soils. A particularly rich variety of trees and shrubs is found in Enipeas' gorge. One can see there elm, cherry plum, European yew, hazel, holly, Cornus mas, manna ash, maple and a considerable variety of herbaceous plants. Gorges and ravines are covered by oriental planes, willows, black alders and riverside greenery.  Boreal coniferous zone  Typical species of this zone is Bosnian pine. This rare kind of pine occurs sporadically higher than 1,000 metres and gradually replaces the black pine, while over 1,400 metres it creates an almost unmixed forest. Οver 2,000 metres the forest becomes sparser, reaching to 2,750 metres, thus creating one of the highest forest tree line limit (limit of forest growth) in the Balkans and Europe. Another feature of this zone is that over 2,500 metres the trees appear in a crawling form. The region, where Bosnian pine grows, is mostly dry and its slopes are rocky. There are no springs or water streams. The vegetation growing there is adapted to specific local conditions and represented by typical shrubs, graminaceous, chasmophytes etc., while the flora includes many endemic species of the Balkans.  Treeless high mountain zone (Alpine tundra)  Beyond Bosnian pine's zone follows an extensive zone, without trees, with alpine meadows, consisted by a mosaic of grassland ecosystems, depending on the topography, the slope and the orientation of the ground. In general, this alpine flora with more than 150 plant species, contains snow accumulation meadows, grassy swamps, alpine scree and rock crevices. On the meadows, the rocks and the steep slopes live most of the endemic Olympus' plants, among them some of the most beautiful wildflowers in Greece. Half of them are found only in the Balkans and 23 only in Olympus and nowhere else.  Local endemic plants  The list of 23 local endemic plants at Mount Olympus from the Olympus National Park Management Agency: Achillea ambrosiaca, Alyssum handelii, Asprerula muscosa, Aubrieta thessala, Campanula oreadum, Carum adamovicii, Centaurea incompleta, Centaurea litochorea, Centaurea transiens, Cerastrium theophrasti, Coincla nivalis, Erysimum olympicum, Festuca olympica, Genista sakellariadis, Jankaea heldreichii, Ligusticum olympicum, Melampyrus ciliatum, Ophrys helenae (Ophrys sphegodes subsp. helenae), Poa thessala, Potentilla deorum, Rynchosinapis nivalis, Silene dionysii, Silene oligantha, Veronica thessalica, Viola striis- notata, Viola pseudograeca.  Fauna  Salamander in Enipeas' gorge Οlympus' fauna, that has not been systematically studied so far, includes considerable variety and is marked by important, rare and endangered species. Large mammals, that lived formerly in the region, like deer, have disappeared. In ancient times there were lions (Pausanias), while at least until the 16th century there were bears (Life of St. Dionysios the Later). There have been recorded 32 species of mammals, including Balkan chamois (Rυρicapra rupicapra balcanica), roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), wild boar, wildcat (Felis sylvestris), beech marten (Martes foina), red fox and red squirrel. There have also been detected 108 species of birds (like sparrowhawk, cinereous vulture, rock partridge, white stork, rock dove, European robin, lanner falcon, peregrine falcon, tree falcon, golden eagle, short-toed snake eagle, booted eagle and hoopoe). Many of them, particularly the birds of prey, are scarce. In addition there are the common reptiles of Greek fauna (22 species like snakes, turtles, lizards, etc.) and some amphibians (8 species) in streams and seasonal ponds, as well as a great variety of insects, particularly butterflies.  National Park  Greece's highest mountain, dwelling of the Twelve Gods of antiquity, has been the first region in the country to be applied specific protective rules, by its declaration as a National Park in 1938. The aim of this declaration was \\"...the preservation in perpetuity of the natural environment of the region, i.e. of wild flora, fauna and natural landscape, as well as its cultural and other values...\\". In addition the declaration has aimed promoting scientific research along with environmental education for the public and tourist development in the region. Specific laws prohibit all forms of exploitation on the eastern side of the mountain in an area of about 4,000 hectares, that is the core of the Park. A wider region, around this core, has been designated \\"peripheral zone of the National Park\\", so that its managing and exploitation to be done so as not to adversely affect the core's protection. At present, the park has been expanded to 24,000 hectares. Administratively it belongs to Pieria's and Larissa's Prefectures and specifically to the municipalities Diou-Olympou and Katerinis (Pieria) and Τempon and Elassonas (Larissa). Its lowest altitude is 600 metres and its peak, Mytikas, at 2,917 metres. In 1981 UNESCO proclaimed Olympus \\"Biosphere Reserve\\". European Union has listed Olympus in the \\"Significant for Birdlife Regions of European Union\\". It is also registered in the list of Natura 2000 European Network as a special protection area and a site of community interest. In June 2016 the Olympus National Park Information Center, located at Litochoro, opened its gates. It informs their visitors about geology, archaeological sites, mythology, monasteries, plants, animals and other subjects affecting Mount Olympus. Hikers will find help from professional rangers, a guide provides tours for groups in the mountain area.  Olympus' National Park's regulations  The Park is protected by specific legislation. Under the \\"Special Regulation\\" entrance to the Park is allowed only by the existing roads and traffic is allowed from sunrise to sunset only on formed paths. The visitor should also know that the following activities are not allowed: * Entrance to children under 14 years unescorted. * Parking in places other than the specific parking lots. * Felling, humus transportation, rooting and collecting shrubs, plants and seeds. * Hunting any animal by any means throughout the year. * Collection and destruction of nests, eggs or chicks and general disturbance and destruction of fauna species. * Damage to geological formations. * Free movement of any animals accompanying visitors.  Access  The path in the Laimou-Ghiosou passage (location Skourta) with the high Olympus peaks in the background Olympus' massif is found about in the middle of Continental Greece and is easy to approach from the national railway network on the Athens-Thessaloniki line and the secondary roads that connect towns and villages around the mountain, with the principal base for excursions being the town of Litochoro, where there are many hotels and taverns. In addition, on Pieria's coastal zone there are many camp sites and lodgings. The nearest international airport is that of Thessaloniki, and railway stations are those of Litochoro, Katerini and Leptokarya. There is frequent service by KTEL buses and a taxi stand is in Litochoro's central square. Map for an overview: More detailed map of the Olympos region:  Refuges  The \\"Spilios Agapitos\\" refuge * Spilios Agapitos, the first refuge of the region, is at the site \\"Βalkoni\\" (or \\"Exostis\\") at altitude.

They are members of the family Accipitridae, under the genus Circus which encompasses other harrier species. Its range encompasses most of South America, in grassland and wetland all across the continent. The long-winged harrier is a carnivorous bird, and will feed on many different animals found in its habitat. Like owls and other harrier species, the long-winged harrier has a distinctive facial disc, which is used to triangulate the bird's hearing while it is hunting. The long-winged harrier is classified as a species of least concern by the IUCN Red List, however their population has been observed to decline due to habitat degradation by human activity.  Description  The long-winged is mid-sized bird of prey, and like most birds of prey species, the females are larger than the males. Males will weigh from 390 g to 464 g (13.8 oz to 16.4 oz) and females will be slightly heavier, ranging from 400 g to 645 g (14.1 oz to 22.8 oz). Their length can range between 46 cm and 60 cm (18.1 in to 23.6 in) and their wingspan ranges between 120 cm and 155 cm (47.2 in to 61.0 in). As other harrier species, the lon-winged harrier can be identified by its long and narrow tail and its especially long wings. Their wings and their back are mostly grey, with the primary feathers on the wings being much darker than the rest of the wing feathers, which are streaked with variants of white, grey and brown. Male long-winged harrier, light morph The long-winged harrier can arbor 2 different morphs, a dark morph and a light morph. In dark morph individuals, the belly is all black with females having more of a brown undertone. The light morph individuals can be identified by their white underparts, which contrasts heavily with their dark morph counterpart. Juvenile long-winged harriers usually have the same colour patterns as females, but they have a more speckled chest. The long-winged harrier morphologically resembles its close relative, the cinereous harrier (Circus cinereus), which can also be found in South America, but their range rarely overlaps. As all other birds of prey species, the long-winged harrier possesses sharp talons used to catch their prey on the ground or in the air, and their legs are bright orange. The species also shares the large hooked beak of other birds of prey, which it uses to tear apart meat once it catches its prey. The long-winged harrier is part of the only diurnal bird of prey group to possess a facial disc. The facial disc is formed by a group of easily recognizable group of feathers that form a disc shape around the bird's face. These feathers can be raised in response to sounds and can improve the bird's hearing when it is hunting by triangulating sounds in its ear holes.  Taxonomy  The long-winged harrier is classified in the genus Circus alongside 15 other harrier species, and it is most closely related to the cinereous harrier, which is the only other harrier species native to South America. The genus name, penned by French naturalist Bernard Germain de Lacépède, can be translated from the Ancient Greek work kirkos meaning circle. This refers to the harrier's hunting strategy of flying in large circles in order to localize their prey. The species name buffoni, referring to French naturalist and director of the Jardin du Roi George-Louis Leclerc Comte de Buffon, was first coined by German naturalist J.F. Gmelin in 1788, when the species was mistakenly classified under the genus Falco. Female long-winged harrier, dark morph  Habitat and Distribution  The long-winged harrier's year-round range encompasses most of eastern South America, including eastern Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil and Paraguay, and extends up to Colombia, Venezuela, and the northern tips of Guyana, Suriname and French Guyana. The species has also been observed occasionally in extant areas such as Bolivia, Peru, Chile, Trinidad and Tobago, and all the way down to Tierra del Fuego in southern Argentina. It is vagrant to Panama and the Falkland Islands. This species occupies large grasslands and agricultural fields, where their wide-range active hunting technique is very effective. Their habitat also includes savanna, marshes and wetlands of South America.  Behavior   Vocalization  Little is known of the long-winged harrier's vocalization, as is not a very vocal bird. It will call mostly when in flight and some variation of the bird's call include a fast succession of \\"klee-klee-klee\\", and a more quiet \\"thrill\\" with a quickly descending pitch. Male long-winged harrier, dark morph  Diet  As all of the extended members of the family Accipitridae, the long-winged harrier is carnivorous, feeding on a large variety of animals due to its widespread distribution. Their diet includes small mammals, amphibians, reptiles and birds, with birds consisting the majority of their food intake. Its hunting strategy differs vastly from other hawks sharing the same habitat such as the Roadside Hawk (Rupornis magnirostris). Instead of opting for a passive hunting strategy consisting of the use of high perches to locate their prey, the long-winged harrier will fly slowly in large circles above its range in order to find its prey, using its keen vision and hearing.  Reproduction  The long-winged harrier nests on the ground, building its nest between September and October in the grasslands of its habitat. The nests are usually made out of rushes and grass, and are built no more than 3 meters up the ground and no less than 1 meter away from bodies of water. Their breeding season can vary vastly across their range, but it will usually take place in the summer months (September to January). During their reproduction cycle, the nests will usually hold between 3 and 4 eggs per clutch.  Conservation  Although the species population has been found to be declining, the extended range of the long-winged harrier allows it to be classified as a species of 'least concern' by the IUCN Red List. Their population decline has been attributed to the degradation of its habitat, most notably wetlands, due to drainage, pollution, and other human-caused circumstances. No conservation efforts are currently in action concerning the long-winged harrier as an individual species, but their range occurs in a wide variety of conservation sites and protected areas.

This species is distributed across the African tropical rainforest, including upper and lower Guinean forests. This serpent eagle specializes in hunting in these forests’ dark understories. It has two subspecies, the nominate subspecies Dryotriorchis spectabilis spectabilis and Dryotriorchis spectabilis batesi. Though monotypic, it appears to be very closely related to Circaetus. This hawk is a medium-sized bird with distinctive short, rounded wings and a long, rounded tail. It is varying shades of brown on its back and has a slight crest. Its breast is white with variable amounts of a rufous wash and, in the nominate subspecies, is covered in round, blackish spots. The subspecies D. s. batesi only has these dots on its flanks. The Congo serpent eagle closely resembles Cassin's hawk-eagle, and some ornithologists believe that this likeness is a rare example of avian mimicry. It is a very vocal raptor, and often is one of the most heard species in its habitat. This serpent eagle feeds on snakes, chameleons, and toads, and hunts these species by dropping onto them from a perch in the understory. Its excellent eyesight enables it to hunt in the dark forest. Very little is known about its breeding habits, though it is suspected to breed from June to December. The Congo serpent eagle is listed as a species of Least Concern due to its large range and population. This species has been kept as a pet. Taxonomy The Congo serpent eagle was first described in 1863 by Hermann Schlegel as Astur spectabilis from a specimen collected near Elmina, Ghana.Brown 1982, p. 350 Schlegel published his description in Nederlandsch Tijdschrift voor De Dierkunde and placed this species within the goshawks. In 1874 George Ernest Shelley, who had access to more specimens, realized that this bird wasn't a goshawk and moved the species into its own monotypic genus, Dryotriorchis. Dryotriorchis is a distinct genus due to its short wings, long tail, short crest, and oval nostrils. The word \\"Dryo-\\" is from the Greek for \\"oak\\" and \\"triorchis\\" from the Greek for \\"hawk\\", specifically a kind of hawk thought to have three testicles. It is believed that the genus is more closely related to Circaetus than Terathopius, and it is possibly a link between these and the Asian genus Spilornis. The syrinx morphology is distinctly like those of accipiter hawks but shows similarities to features found in Nisaetus. Two subspecies are known: the nominate subspecies Dryotriorchis spectabilis spectabilis and D. s. batesi. D. s. batesi was originally described as a separate species, Dryotriorchis batesi, by Richard Bowdler Sharpe in 1904 due to its unspotted breast. Sharpe named the subspecies in honor of G. L. Bates, who shipped him specimens from Cameroon. This species is also known as the West African Serpent eagle and the African Serpent-eagle.Ferguson-Lees 2001, p. 128Thiollay 1994, p. 134 Syrinx morphology The Congo serpent eagle is superficially similar in plumage and size to Cassin's hawk-eagle, which has an overlapping range with the serpent eagle. It has been suggested that the Congo serpent eagle evolved to mimic the Cassin's hawk-eagle, which could give the serpent eagle several advantages, possibly including the ability to trick its reptilian prey into not fleeing, lowering its own predation, and/or minimizing mobbing by birds through its resemblance to a predator of birds. D. s. spectabilis more closely resembles the immature Cassin's hawk-eagle, while D. s. batesi resembles the adult. This is one of very few suspected examples of avian mimicry. Description Adult of the nominate subspecies This hawk is a medium-sized, slender species with short, rounded wings and a long, rounded tail. It is long, with the tail contributing . The wingspan is across. The adult of the nominate subspecies, Dryotriorchis spectabilis spectabilis, has a blackish-brown crown and upper neck while the sides of the neck and a broad collar are a dark rufous-brown. The feathers on the top of the head are slightly pointed, giving this species a hint of a crest. The remaining upperparts are a dark chocolate brown. The cheeks are light brown while the throat is buffy white with streaks. The eyes are large and dark brown or grey in females and yellow in males while the beak is short but deep. It also has a black median streak. The bird's underparts are white with variable amounts of rufous wash and a number of large, round blackish spots. The serpent eagle's thighs are barred sepia-brown and white, while the undertail is white. The underwing is largely white with some black spots and brown coloration. The tail is light brown, with five to six broad black bars. The claws are short and sharp, while the legs are yellow. Sexes are similar, though the female averages about three percent larger than the male.Ferguson-Lees 2001, p. 472 Immatures have a white crown and mantle, while the upper back has rounded brown or black spots that vanish as the bird ages. The wings and tail are greyish-brown and paler than those of the adults and are more darkly barred. D. s. batesi is similar to the nominate subspecies, but is browner and paler on the back while the spots on D. s. spectabilis's chest only appear on this subspecies' flanks. The immature does possess a spotted chest, with the spots vanishing as the bird ages. This is a very vocal raptor and is one of the most frequently heard birds of prey in its range.Brown 1982, p. 351 It makes a cat-like meowing sound as well as a low, mournful, nasal \\"cow-cow-cow\\" at intervals over extended periods of time. When heard over a large distance, some ornithologists have compared its call to that of a turaco. Distribution and habitat Congo serpent eagle in Ghana. The Congo serpent eagle lives in southern Sierra Leone and Guinea, Liberia, and southern Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana.Ferguson-Lees 2001, p. 471 It is also found in southern Nigeria and the Central African Republic south through northern and eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo in the east and through Gabon into the northern Republic of the Congo in the west with an isolated population in northern Angola. D. s. spectabilis is found in upper Guinean forests from Liberia to northern Cameroon, while D. s. batesi is found in lower Guinean forests from southern Cameroon through Gabon and western Uganda. Its range covers . The species lives in dense primary forest below in elevation in the dark understory. As it is adapted for dense forest, it is not well-adapted for secondary forests and plantations. The Congo serpent eagle does not migrate, though it is unknown if it is locally nomadic. Ecology and behavior Little is known about this species' behavior. The Congo serpent eagle lives in the understory of its habitat and occasionally perches on lower boughs in tall trees. It lives either alone or in pairs. This species is known to hunt snakes, lizards, especially chameleons, toads, and potentially small mammals. It hunts by dropping to the ground from its perch in the understory, where it may strike its prey repeatedly with its feet; this serpent eagle may also grab prey from the foliage while hunting. Its large eyes enable this species to hunt in low light, though it is diurnal. Studies on the species' eyes have shown that they have about two times the visual resolution of a human's. It may breed from October to December in Gabon and from June to November in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Relationship with humans Currently, the Congo serpent eagle's population is dwindling due to deforestation. However, it is listed as a species of Least Concern due to its large population of over 10,000 adults and large range of . This species has been kept as a pet and in the 1970s was available from some pet shops. The Congo serpent eagle has been depicted on postage stamps from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Tanzania.

It is monotypic within the genus Geranospiza. In flight Taxonomy The crane hawk used to be many species that were recently lumped into one. Those species are now designated as subspecies. Color varies clinally, though, and it is now commonly accepted that they comprise one species. There are also two species of harrier-hawks in Africa of the genus Polyboroides that, while they are morphologically and behaviorally similar, are not very closely related. They serve as a good example of convergent evolution. Habitat and distribution Crane hawks occur in tropical lowlands at the edge of forests and are almost always closely associated with water. It is found in Argentina, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, French Guiana, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Trinidad, Uruguay, and Venezuela. They are an irruptive and local migrant, probably moving in response to changing water conditions. Behavior These hawks often forage by scanning from a perch or on the wing and swooping down to grab prey. However, they are notable for having “double-jointed” tarsal bones, allowing them to reach into tree cavities and extract prey, a trait they share only with the genus of African harrier-hawks Polyboroids. Their main prey are small vertebrates, especially rodents, bats, lizards, snakes, and small birds, but they have also been known to eat larger insects and other arthropods and snails. During breeding, nests are built in tree canopies, often in clumps of orchids or other epiphytes. The nest is a shallow cup of twigs, anywhere from 10–25 metres up in a tree. Clutches are usually 1-2 white-or-bluish-tinged eggs. Conservation Nowhere is the crane hawk particularly common, but it is still widely distributed. However, it is considered threatened in Mexico, endangered in El Salvador, and at low risk in Argentina.

Standing around tall, the adult black honey-buzzard has a dark head and body, with striking white bands on its tail and flight feathers. When in flight, species can be recognized by its long wings and noticeably large secondary feathers. It is thought to be sedentary, with its range limited to the island of New Britain in Papua New Guinea, where it is endemic. Due to its remote habitat and tendency to remain in densely forested areas, there is currently much to learn about this striking species. Description The black honey- buzzard is a dark grey-brown colour with pale silvery bars on the wings and tail. When perched, the wing and tail bars are clearly visible. In flight, the wing bars are notable and the wing shape is distinctive, with a narrow base and broad tips, and bulging outer primaries. Juvenile markings are unknown. Its height ranges , and wingspan ranges . Taxonomy The black honey-buzzard belongs within the subfamily Perninae, in the family Accipitridae. The family Acipitridae contains two subfamilies of kites: Elaninae and Perninae. Birds within Perninae lack the bony eye shield that characterizes those in Elaninae, and are mainly found in the tropics where they are specialized to feed on insects, bee and wasp larvae. The genus Henicopernis contains only two species: The black honey-buzzard and the long-tailed honey-buzzard (Henicopernis longicauda). The Australo-Papuan region, which encompasses Australia and Papua New Guinea, has many endemic species since the region was isolated from other land masses for millions of years. These include three closely related genera of the family Accipitridae: Henicopernis, Hamirostra and Lophoictinia. Habitat and distribution The black honey-buzzard occurs on the island of New Britain, part of the Bismarck archipelago in Papua New Guinea. Its habitat consists of primary rainforest, usually in hilly areas. Its altitudinal range extends to . The population is estimated to be between 6000 and 15 000 mature individuals. Behaviour Vocalizations Its vocalizations consist of 12 piping notes, accelerating and shortening over about three seconds. Diet The diet is largely unknown, but it is assumed that it is similar to that of the long-tailed honey-buzzard, which typically feeds on arthropods, lizards, birds and birds’ eggs. Reproduction The black honey-buzzard is unobtrusive, and is seldom sighted due to its shy nature. Although the generation length has not been studied directly, it is estimated to be approximately 10 years, based on that of two similar-sized raptors: The square-tailed kite (Lophoictinia isura) and the red goshawk (Erythrotriorchis radiatus). Status and conservation The black honey- buzzard is highly dependent on primary forest, where it nests and feeds. This species is estimated to have lost 12.5% of the primary forest within its range between the years 1990 and 2000. The island of New Britain has experienced considerable deforestation due to logging, as well as land use change as forested areas are converted to small-scale agricultural operations and oil palm plantations. In 2004, West New Britain province accounted for over 50% of Papua New Guinea's timber exports. However, a great deal of the species’ range is on steep and montane areas which are not suitable for logging or oil palm production. The black honey-buzzard is classified as Vulnerable according to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. This classification is primarily due to the continuing decline the area of available habitat.

Halfway House: Southern Book Publishers. . is a medium-sized bird of prey in the family Accipitridae. It is native to African woodlands. Its name honors South African ornithologist Thomas Ayres. Description The adult male has blackish upperparts which are mottled with white, and usually has a white forehead and supercilium. The upper-wing coverts are similar. The tail is ashy grey with a broad black tip and three to four narrower dark bars. Primary feathers and secondary feathers are black. The underparts are white, with heavy dark brown spots and blotches on the breast and belly, becoming sparser on thighs and vent. The legs are pure white. The under-wing coverts are brown marked with white, the under side of flight feathers is dark and heavily barred lacking any noticeable grey patch. The eyes are yellow to orange, the cere and feet yellow, the bill is bluish horn coloured becoming paler towards the base, with a black tip. The males are smaller than the females which are also darker and usually more densely spotted on the underparts, and have a smaller amount of white on the forehead and supercilium. There are two phases, the normal as described above and a melanistic phase, which is mostly black with white markings. Distribution and movements Ayres's hawk-eagle has a patchy sub- Saharan distribution ranging from Sierra Leone east to Somalia, and south to northern Namibia and northeast South Africa. In the rainy season moves out of denser and taller deciduous woodlands of central Africa into more open tree savanna further south, and probably into coastal East Africa; as the rains cause the leaves to emerge turning woodland into forest and tree savanna into woodland. It may then enter towns in South Africa to prey mainly on doves and feral pigeons. A similar north to south movement is expected in west Africa, where species has been recorded as a vagrant west to Senegal and Gambia, albeit unconfirmed. Biology Ayres's hawk-eagle is a bird hunter, almost to the exclusion of any other type of prey, especially doves and pigeons, it soars high above the ground to search for prey. Once a bird has been singled out, the eagle stoops to intercept it in mid air. Other than birds it has been recorded as catching a few mammals including bush squirrels, and fruit bats. Ayres's hawk-eagle is a monogamous, territorial solitary nester. The nest consists of a platform of a twigs and sticks, lined with green leaves and typically concealed in the fork within a well-leafed, large tree. Eggs are laid from April to September, peaking in April and May. A single egg is laid, female is almost solely responsible for incubation which takes about 43 days, the male brings her food every two to three days. The chick is fed almost daily, fledging at about 73 days old and becoming fully independent from its parents approximately three months after fledging. Conservation status Although Ayres's hawk-eagle is an uncommon bird throughout its range, it is classified as Least Concern (LC) by the IUCN, due to its large range and its numbers, while small, appearing stable at the present time.

Its natural habitats are primarily subtropical or tropical moist lowland forest and subtropical or tropical moist montane forest. It was the smallest species of eagle. Taxonomy The pygmy eagle was described by German naturalist Anton Reichenow as Eutolmaetus weiskei in 1900. It was subsequently considered a subspecies of the little eagle or a distinct species. Gjershaug and colleagues analysed it genetically and found it distinct enough to warrant species status. The International Ornithologists' Union (IOC) subsequently recognised it as a distinct species. \\"Pygmy eagle\\" has been designated the official name by the IOC. Description Size One of the world's smallest-known species of eagle, the pygmy eagle measures in length. The wingspan measures . The female eagle is slightly smaller than the male. Identification The pygmy eagle shares many characteristics with its counterpart the little eagle. The most notable differences are color. The pygmy eagle has darker more pronounced streaks on the nape, crown and ventral. The bird also shares characteristics with the booted eagle, both eagles have a unique underwing pattern. The plumage of the pygmy eagle can vary depending on the morph, light or dark. The dark morph is very similar to the dark morph of the little eagle, while the light morph shows the most differences that occur in the dark streaking. The dark morph seems to be rarer as 10 out of 11 field sightings have been the light morph. The feet of the eagle are described as grey or dull yellow. Voice The voice of the pygmy eagle has been described as a \\"sip sip yeeee\\" during flights. The call can also be compared to the little eagle and booted eagle. The bird has also been observed giving a weaker single tone squeal. Distribution and habitat The pygmy eagle primarily resides in lowland forests and forest edges in New Guinea. They enjoy nesting in closed forestry but have also been seen in open habitat and forest edges. The bird seems to be sparsely distributed throughout the hilly forests of New Guinea; however much of the forests of New Guinea are inaccessible so the eagle may be more abundant than it seems. One of the densely forested parts of New Guinea is Vogelkop or Bird's Head Peninsula. The pygmy eagle has been observed nineteen times in the Vogelkop over three years. It has also been observed on the island Buru and in the northern Moluccas. Food Pygmy eagles have been seen soaring and diving on prey in forest canopies. The raptor is capable of very swift dives and attacks other avians such as the brown cuckoo-dove and mountain fruit-dove. Usually, the raptor low soars over the canopy scanning for prey and then dives on other birds in the canopy.

The golden lined whiting can be more readily distinguished by its colour than other whitings in the genus Sillago, although swim bladder morphology and spine and ray counts are the most precise method of identification. S. analis is an opportunistic predator, taking a variety of crustaceans, polychaetes and molluscs, with a transition of diet seen as the fish mature. One unusual aspect about the species diet is the large amounts of molluscan siphons it takes. The species spawns between January and March, with juvenile fish inhabiting the shallow protected coastal waters. Golden lined whiting is important to fisheries centered on Shark Bay in Western Australia and also in Queensland, although makes up a relatively minor component of the whiting fishery. Taxonomy and naming The golden lined whiting is a member of the genus Sillago, which contain 29 other species. It is part of the family Sillaginidae which is a division of the Percoidei, a suborder of the Perciformes. The species was named by Whitley in 1943 as Sillago analis, designating a specimen collected at Shark Bay as the holotype. Another currently valid species of sillaginid, Sillago nierstraszi is according to McKay (1985) almost certainly a senior synonym of S. analis. The holotype for S. nierstraszi has not been examined by McKay, however, and uncertainty about this relationship remains. S. analis has a three local names used in northern Australia, with 'golden lined whiting' the most prevalent. 'Tin Can Bay whiting' is applied to the species in parts of Queensland, referring to the locality of the same name in that state, while the name 'rough-scale whiting is also used in parts of Western Australia. Description The golden lined whiting has a very similar profile to other members of the genus Sillago, with a slightly compressed, elongate body tapering toward the terminal mouth. It differs from some members of the genus in that its ventral profile is more rounded than most other species, which tend to have a flat profile. The number of spines and rays, vertebrae and swim bladder morphology are other distinguishing features. S. analis has a first dorsal fin consisting of 11 spines followed by a second dorsal fin consisting of one spine and between 16 and 18 soft rays. The anal fin has 2 spines followed by 14 to 17 soft rays. Over the distribution of the species, the vertebrae number differs, with fish in Western Australia having 33 and those in south east Queensland having one or two additional modified vertebrae. Also varying over the range is the lateral line scale count, with Western Australian fish having less than Queensland fish, with the range for the species between 54 and 61 scales. The swim bladder of the species is very similar and in some cases indistinguishable from a related species, Sillago ciliata, with the anterior part of the swim bladder having rudimentary tubules projecting anteriorly and a lateral series of tubules that diminishes in size and become sawtooth-like, projecting posteriorly. The golden lined whiting's common name is derived from its colour, having a dull golden-silver to golden- yellow band running longitudinally on the sides below the lateral line. The body is an overall silver colour, being slightly darker above. The pelvic and anal fins are pale to bright yellow, while the pectoral fin has a darker dusting of fine black-brown spots with no black spot at the base. Distribution and habitat The golden lined whiting is located in the southern Indo-Pacific along the northern coastline of Australia, from Shark Bay in Western Australia north along the coastline of the Northern Territory, around the Queensland coastline to Moreton Bay. The species also extends north to the south coast of Papua New Guinea, although inhabits a small range. The species prefers shallow, protected waters up to a maximum of 10 m depth, often inhabiting protected embayments. The juveniles tend to remain in the warmer, shallow waters of protected inlets, mangroves and estuaries, often with other species of whiting. Adults prefer to inhabit protected muddy tidal streams where they forage in the silty substrate, while other species of whiting in the range move to open tidal sand flats. Biology Diet The diet of the golden lined whiting varies along its range, however it takes similar food and shows the same transition in prey items during its lifetime throughout its distribution. Juvenile fish tend to take a mixture of polychaetes which they 'plough' from the sand, small bivalves, including Mesodesma eltanae and Glauconome virens as well as amphipods while at lengths less than 80 mm. Adult fish tend to take larger prey, predominantly larger bivalves with small quantities of penaeids and brachyuran crabs, which corresponds to a dentitional change to molariform crushing plates. Studies by Brewer et al. (1992) have shown that the Golden lined whiting is an opportunistic nocturnal hunter, taking the most vulnerable, easily accessible prey. This may because they are relatively abundant, poorly shelled or unable to escape quickly. The most commonly caught prey at night were crustaceans, while buried annelids were ignored and molluscs were left alone except for taking the unprotected siphon tips of a species of bivalve; Glauconome virens. A study on the diet of young S. analis from a mangrove tidal flat in Deception Bay in Queensland has shown that the siphon tips of this mollusc comprise the majority of most fish's diet, with very few other molluscs taken whole. Adult fish greater than 200 mm had no siphons in their diet however, electing to take larger molluscs, annelids or crustaceans. Reproduction S. analis spawns between the months of January and March. The females of the species are larger than the males when they reach maturity, attaining a length of 216 mm compared to males 184 mm. Twenty percent of the females and 60% of the males of S. analis reach maturity by the end of their second year of life, with all individuals mature by the end of the third. Juveniles of the species inhabit shallow shores including lower sections of creeks and rivers, favouring muddy-sand substrates also with less than 1 m depth. The species has been known to reach a maximum of 45 cm long. Relationship to humans The golden lined whiting is a major commercial species in some parts of its range, particularly in Shark Bay and to a lesser extent in Queensland. It is often taken alongside other species of whiting which also constitute major parts of the local fishery. The amount of fish taken by professionals fluctuates, with an example monthly 1998/1999 catch weighing 5,399 kg, a massive amount less than the 196,293 kg of western sand whiting taken in the same period. Being that the juveniles enter mangrove creeks, the species may be a future candidate for estuarine aquaculture, which has seen other species of sillaginid cultured in Asia. The species is a common target for recreational fishermen, with large catches possible. Golden lined whiting respond to bait which resembles their normal prey and are taken on yabbies, crabs, soldier crabs, mussels of many different sorts, worms and prawn, in particular jelly prawn. This species will also take a variety of wet flies and small lures. They are commonly caught over their foraging habitats, particularly sand flats, tailing sand banks, shallow and deep weed beds, over yabby beds, and particularly in muddy mangrove areas. The flesh of this whiting is sweet and although slightly softer in texture than the sand whiting, is equal to it for high eating quality. In Queensland, the minimum size for taking golden lined whiting is 23 cm, and there is a bag limit of 30 combined with sand whiting.

This low-density species has traditionally been believed to be restricted to Amazon Basin north of the Amazon River, but there are several records south of this river, in, for example, the Brazilian states of Pará and Acre, and southeastern Peru. It is closely related to the white- browed hawk and individuals showing a level of intermediacy between the two species are known, suggesting that they rarely hybridize  Description  The black-faced hawk is a medium-sized hawk with black and white plumage. It has a white underbelly, a large white head streaked with some black and a characteristic black “mask”. Below the black mask, it has a dark orange cere and a black tipped bill. The back of the hawk is dark all the way down to the tail with some mottling. However, a single white band sticks out near the base of the tail. Juvenile plumage resembles adult plumage except that juveniles have thinner streaks of black on the head, two white bands instead of a single one in the tail, and brown at the tips of the feathers. The black-faced hawk adult looks very similar to the juvenile white-browed hawk. Both hawks have a white head streaked with black, a black face mask and white mottling on the back. The key difference between the sister species is that there are two white bands in the tail of the juvenile white-browed hawk whereas there is only a single band in the adult black-faced hawk. Additionally, at any age, L. melanops has a greater amount of white in the back compared to Leucopternis kuhli.  Taxonomy  The genus Leucopternis currently is considered to contain 10 species of forest-dwelling hawks ranging from Argentina and Uruguay to Southern Mexico. L. kuhli is considered the sister species of L. melanops. Both hawks also happen to be the smallest members of their genus since their total length is < 40 cm. Analysis of mtDNA phylogenetic trees showed that there were three highly supported clades giving a polyphyletic relationship between the species of the genera Leucopternis, Buteogallus and Buteo. Within the Leucopternis lineage, L.melanops and L. kuhli were shown as a sister pair. Gene flow and/or hybridization occurring between both species would explain the similar plumage patterns.  Habitat and distribution  Despite the status of the black-faced hawk as being a rare to uncommon bird, it is widespread north of the Amazon River. Its occurrence south of the Amazon is controversial due to possible confusion with L. kuhli which occurs there. However, the consensus on the range limits for L. melanops is from lowland Peru north of the Amazon and northeastern Ecuador to Venezuela, southern Colombia, Brazil north of the Amazon and the Guyanas.  First sightings south of the Amazon  In 1931, Amadon (1964)Amadon, D. 1964. Taxonomic notes on birds of prey. American Museum Novitates 2166:1. Retrieved from http://digitallibrary.amnh.org/handle/2246/3352 reported the first sighting of one L. melanops near the lower Tapajós River. This observation was the first indication that L. melanops and L. kuhli could co-occur and that the true range of L. melanops included the southern part of the Amazon. However this sighting remains controversial due to the lack of similar sightings following this report and due to the morphological similarities between both species which could lead to a mistaken identification.Barlow, J., T. Haugasen, & Peres C. (2002). Sympatry of the Black-faced Hawk and White-browed Hawk in the Lower Rio Tapajos, Para, Brasil. Cotinga, 18, 77–79. Retrieved from http://www.avibirds.com/pdfsu/Z/Zwartmaskerbuizerd1.pdf  Habitat  The black-faced hawk's preferred habitat is within the tall lowland forest of the Amazon. It may also reside amongst the forest edges, along rivers and mangroves.  Behaviour  The black-faced hawk prefers to remain under forest cover but due to its occurrence near the forest edge, it may perch there and commonly-so in the morning.  Flight  It has not been seen soaring during flight. Instead, it will glide shortly followed by fast wing beats.  Vocalizations  The voice call is a piercing, acute and descending whistle: “KEEuuu” or “KEEler” or “KEEyer\\".  Diet  Very little information has been recorded on the diet of the black-faced hawk. Although it is assumed that the raptor must have a similar diet to that of the birds in its genus. snakes and other reptiles are the main prey of all Leucopternis species and hence possibly the main diet for the black-faced hawk as well.Del Hoyo, J., Elliot, A. & Sargatal, J. eds. (1994). Handbook of the Birds of the World. Vol. 2. New World Vultures to Guineafowl. Barcelona: Lynx Edicions  Reproduction  Currently, no direct observations have been reported on the reproductive behaviour of the species. However, it is assumed that this behaviour will resemble that of most species within the genus Leucopternis. Among this genus, raptors make a stick nest in the canopy of a tree and both parents share parental care by incubating the eggs for a period of five weeks.

Its primary purpose was to test long- range radio propagation and radar techniques in the presence of the aurora borealis. This was part of a greater ABM effort being carried out in concert with the United States Air Force, and PARL operated along with two similar instruments at the Rome Air Development Centre and MIT Lincoln Laboratory. The site continues to operate today, used as a satellite downlink station known as the Prince Albert Satellite Station (PASS). The original study that led to PARL came about as the side effect of questions about the effects of the aurora on radar systems. There was some concern that the aurora could shield incoming reentry vehicles from observation until they were too low to be effectively attacked by the long range interceptor missiles then being designed (Nike Zeus). The United States Air Force sent a request to Peter Forsyth for further information. Forsyth had done extensive research on the aurora while earning his PhD at the University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, including the first observations using radar. Forsyth was invited to a meeting at Rome, the outcome eventually led to an agreement whereby two radars would be sent to Canada, one would be placed in Churchill, Manitoba where the aurora is often at its maximum, while another would be located a distance away at a lower \\"grazing angle\\" in order to compare the returns from two different locations. Finding a suitable location was not difficult; they wanted a site near Saskatoon so travel from the University would not be onerous, but one that would have line-of-sight visibility of Churchill.The Prince Albert Radar Laboratory, 1958 – 1963 At first a site outside Dundurn was considered, but eventually Prince Albert was selected instead. This may have had a lot to do with Prince Albert being in the home riding of the Prime Minister, John Diefenbaker. After a visit to Millstone Hill Observatory, where the Lincoln Lab was developing what would become the BMEWS radar, a suitable lab for the Prince Albert site was selected. The Millstone Hill site used a prefab steel building, but a Canadian equivalent was selected in its place, and construction on the \\"silo\\" for the radar started while the buildings arrived and were assembled. The BMEWS radar operated on a frequency of 448 MHz with a peak design power of 2.5 MW and maximum average power of 100 kW. The output was fed via waveguide to an 84 foot parabolic reflector mounted on an altazimuth mount. It was equipped with a conical scanning feed, providing higher resolution and making automatic tracking easier.PARL, Del Hansen Limited operations started in 1959. The official opening was on June 6, 1959, by John Diefenbaker. For this event, a recorded message by U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower was to be broadcast from the Millstone Hill site, reflected off the Moon, and received at PARL. After some tense debugging prior to the attempt, the \\"trick\\" went off without a hitch.Message Transmitted Via the Moon to the Prime Minister and People of Canada Upon the Opening of the Prince Albert Radar Laboratory The main purpose of the instrument was radar observation of the aurora, which started in January 1960 and were carried out for some time. Rockets fired from the Churchill Rocket Research Range, often Black Brants, were tracked by PARL at angles similar to those that the BMEWS radar would be tracking over-pole missile launches from its sites in Alaska and Greenland. PARL also tracked Arcas rockets fired from Cold Lake. In order to support this work, an experimental computer built at the DRTE in Ottawa, known only as the DRTE Computer, was adapted to create the Digital Analyzer and Recorder, or DAR. The site was also used as a space radar system, starting a satellite tracking program in February 1960. The radar was used to track the decay of several satellites, including Sputnik 3, 4 and 5, Delta 2, and Epsilon 2. Sputnik 4 was the first test of the Vostok spacecraft; after launch its orbital period was 91.27 minutes, but on May 19 the PARL staff noted that the period was 94.26 minutes and it had been joined by seven new objects. It is assumed this was due to an explosion. PARL also used the Echo 1 satellite in a repetition of the earlier Moon-bounce experiments. After being operational only a short time, on January 31, 1961 a major fire broke out that destroyed the buildings. Contrary to the findings of the government, the \\"equivalent\\" building did not have nearly the same fireproofing as the US design, and the fire proved unstoppable. Some of the equipment was saved, and replacements forthcoming, and the radar was soon in operation again. DAR was one of the instruments lost in the 1961 fire, and a replacement had to be built, arriving in 1962. PARL later served a number of roles. For some time it was the major Canadian ground receiving station for satellite communications, both for US satellites, and the Canadian Alouette 1. The DRTE Computer was used in this role too, calculating the path of the satellite over the PARL site, allowing the radar dish to be steered into the proper location to receive the signals from the quickly moving source. In 1968 the distance from the Algonquin Radio Observatory to the PARL site was measured to 2,143 km +/- 20 m.Canadian Spatial Reference System, Algonquin Radio Observatory Today the Prince Albert Satellite Station is operated by Canada Centre for Remote Sensing a branch of Natural Resources Canada as a ground station for the following satellites:Prince Albert Satellite Station * Landsat-8 * RADARSAT-2 * NEOSSat * SCISAT References Category:Laboratories in Canada Category:Scientific organizations based in Canada Category:Buildings and structures in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan Category:Military research installations of Canada Category:Natural Resources Canada ","title":"Prince Albert Radar Laboratory"},{"id":"12418754","text":"The grey-backed hawk (Pseudastur occidentalis) is a species of bird of prey in the family Accipitridae.

Description The adult of this medium- sized hawk has a bulky appearance with broad “shoulders” relative to total length.Seipke SH, Kajiwara D, Albuquerque JBL. 2006. Field identification of Mantled Hawk Leucopternis polionotus. Neotropical Birding 1: 42-47. The body length measures 470-510mm, with females being slightly larger than males.Blake ER. 1977. Manual of Neotropical Birds, Vol. 1. Chicago. The head, neck, upper back and entire undersurface except for the black wing tips and basal half of the tail are white. The white round head appears disproportionately large relative to the rest of the body and sometimes projects further than the tail. There are also markings around eyes, giving a masked appearance. The ceres and lores are grey or dull yellow. The bill is pale grey, gradually turning black at the tip. The iris is brown but often appears black in the field. The toes and tarsi are orange-yellow. The wings, lower back and rump are black or dark bluish grey, with the dark primaries, secondaries, tertials and upper tail coverts having greyish bases with thin white square tips. They also have 3-4 narrow darker bands and the broad white tips form a shallow U when seen from behind. The mantle, scapulars and upper tail coverts are also black or slate grey with broad white tips, but with the coverts appearing darker than the scapulars and are tipped white, sometimes giving a barred appearance. When perched, the long primaries reach or exceed the tail tip.De la Pena MR, Rumboll M. 1998. Birds of southern South America and Antarctica. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press. The long secondaries reach halfway to the tail tip and conceal the rump and base of tail, which makes the tail appear very short. In flight, this hawk glides on level wings and soars frequently throughout the day, though it is easily spotted when perched at exposed positions at distances over 1 km. When the hawk is seen in flight from below, only the white part of the square tail is visible; but in some individuals, one or two dark bands may be visible at the tail base. Overall, it is similar to the white-necked hawk in its appearance and flight pattern, but has a broad white leading edge on the wings and tail end, whereas this is black in the white-necked hawk. The dark tail base of the latter is however not usually seen in flight, making distinction between these two species difficult in the field. Flat wing length measurement has been reported as 360-380mm in males, and 390-410mm in females. Other reported measurements include a tail length of 178-222mm, tarsus length of 95.3mm, and culmen length from cere as 29-30mm. The juvenile is similar to the adult but the plumage is fairly spotted overall, with dark streaks on the white crown and nape which are visible at a distance. The upper wing coverts are fringed whitish and there are dark bars at the base of the tail which are more numerous and noticeable than in adults. The cere ranges from whitish to dull yellow. right Habitat and distribution The mantled hawk has a small and patchy distribution within the Atlantic Forest of South America, but may generally occur at higher altitudes than similar species.Mallet-Rodrigues F, Marinho de Noronha ML. 2009.

Threats The population has become substantially reduced and fragmented through persistent deforestation of its habitat, particularly through exploitation of iron ore deposits. However, the threat from deforestation is considered to be less than for other hawk species such as white-necked hawk because of the former species’ more upland and extensive range. Although agricultural conversion and deforestation for mining and plantation production have led to large population declines, these are regarded as historical threats.Fearnside P. 1996. Brazil. In: Harcourt CS, Sayer JA (ed). The conservation atlas of tropical forests: the Americas pp. 229-248. Simon and Schuster, New York and London. Currents threats to the species include urbanisation, industrialisation, agricultural expansion, colonisation and associated road-building.Dinerstein E, Olson DM, Graham DJ, Webster AL, Primm SA, Bookbinder MP, Ledec G. 1995. A conservation assessment of the terrestrial ecoregions of Latin America and the Caribbean. World Bank, Washington, DC. However, this hawk may be able to adapt to patchworks of pine plantations and native forest. Its ability to persist in fragmented forests is a topic of ongoing investigation and an extension of the protected area network to include remaining core areas of forest, alongside increased protection of remaining forest patches, has been suggested. In culture and relation to humans This raptor displays marked territorial behaviour in human presence, defending its territory against human intruders by regurgitating stomach contents or by pursuit. In human presence, mantled hawks are fairly vocal and call repeatedly, which makes them relatively easy to detect when present a few kilometres away. Status This raptor has been evaluated as Near Threatened by the IUCN since 2004 because of the small and strongly declining population. The overall population is estimated at 3500-15000 individuals.

It has also been known as the black-chested hawk. It is found in Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Panama, and Peru. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forest and subtropical or tropical moist montane forest. 10,000 to 100,000 barred hawks are thought to exist throughout Central and South America. Barred hawks mainly live in the dense forests of the lowland and mountainous areas. Taxonomy and evolution Phillip L. Schlater first classified the barred hawk in 1865. Barred hawks are in the family Accipitridae that contains all the hawks, eagles, and old world vultures.Raposo do Amaral, Fabio S., Matthew J. Miller, Luis F. Silveira, Eldredge Bermingham, and Anita Wajntal. \\"Polyphyly of the hawk genera Leucopternis and Buteogallus (Aves, Accipitridae): multiple habitat shifts during the Neotropical buteonine diversification.\\" BMC Evolutionary Biology 6 (2006). Recent research-using mtDNA to analyze the phylogeny of this genus has been done. What researchers found was that the black and white plumage of genus Leucopternis has evolved at least twice, and the widespread occurrence of this plumage pattern may result from plumage convergence in forested. In classical taxonomy, the black and white plumage pattern was overemphasized in the grouping of Leucopternis and plumage patterns alone may not be reliable taxonomic markers in this family. Studies suggest placing it in its own genus. Physical characteristics Morphnarchus princeps appears black with a single white tail bar from above. The black barred and white belly and under-wing coverts contrast with the black throat, breast, and wing quills.Brown, Leslie and Amadon, Dean (1986) Eagles, Hawks and Falcons of the World. The Wellfleet Press. . Barred hawks have a snout- like bill that makes them look like they have a heavy head. Despite being a fairly large hawk, of similar size to a large member of the Buteo genus, its wing spread is relatively smaller than most related largish hawks, which allow them to maneuver through the thick forest canopy easier. Total length is from and wingspan is from . M. princeps weighs about Chavarría-Duriaux, L., Hille, D. C., & Dean, R. (2018). Birds of Nicaragua: A Field Guide. Cornell University Press. The female barred hawk, showing sexual dimorphism, is larger than the males. In wing chord length, males measure about and wing length is in females. They have very broad wings and short tail: wingspan is 2.2 times total length of the bird. The body of a barred hawk is dark grey with a white chest. On the chest are uniformly spaced black bars, which is where the hawk gets its name. The calls of M. princeps include high-pitched screaming or whistling, hoarse \\"whees\\", \\"yips\\", \\"dits\\", and \\"weeps\\".Slud, Paul. The Birds of Costa Rica. New York: American Museum of Natural History, 1964. Barred hawks are usually noisy when soaring in the sky. Distribution and habitat This species of hawk has a large Extent of Occurrence of 350,000 km2. The barred hawks is primarily a Caribbean species of the middle altitudes, and are found in Costa Rica, Peru, and Panama and on both sides of the Andes in northern Ecuador and western Columbia. Subtropical or tropical lowland and mountain forests are the natural habitat of the barred hawk. They live between in elevation and are most abundant in the elevation range. Behavior Morphnarchus princeps hunts mostly in the canopy and along mountain forests. The hunting technique of barred hawks contains both active and inactive activities. The hawks can be seen silently sitting on a branch looking for prey or habitually soaring noisily in the sky in a group of two or more. Barred hawks rarely leave the forest region to hunt but may hunt along the edges.Brown, Leslie. Birds of Prey: Their Biology and Ecology. New York: A&W; Publisher, 1956. They swiftly and quietly fly from branch to branch, when hunting within the forest. When perching they are usually at a mid to low height off the ground and are often on the hunt for slow prey such as frogs, snakes, small mammals and birds, and large insects. Of 104 prey items brought to a nest in Ecuador, 48% consisted of La Bonita caecilians and 35% were various snakes.Gelis, R. A., & Greeney, H. F. (2007). Nesting of Barred Hawk (Leucopternis princeps) in northeast Ecuador. Ornitología Neotropical, 18(4), 607-612. Further study supports the significance of caecilians, largely subterranean and worm-like but potentially large (exceeding when taken) amphibians, in this species' diet, especially when recent rainfall appears to draw the prey to the surface of the ground.Greeney, H.

It soon became the sixth lock proceeding upstream, as it is today. The main weir was built in 1846 when positioned below the offtake of the Abbey River, a medieval-established leat and so sited for the benefit of watermill power; the grain mills were by the end of that century superseded by large industrial granaries. Horse, cattle and crop farming tenants had conflicting interest of reducing its flow; in spate, the weirs elsewhere reduced the flow of the main river for a mile or more (such as beside Laleham Park). For a few years the leat was sourced above the main weir thus increasing the flooding of Laleham Burway and other fields of northern Chertsey; its shallow course has banks without bundings and few sluices. These interests outweighing those of the outdated mill led to start of the Abbey River being moved to below the main weir of Penton Hook, reducing the enhanced flows along the Abbey River. To resume additional flood relief channels, as of the early 2020s, the Environment Agency proposes new instances of channels below this lock and that below to act in the same way as the Jubilee River upstream which fast tracks flows from above Maidenhead to below Windsor.Lower Thames Strategy Study: Strategic Environmental Assessment environmental report, Environment Agency, 2009.

It is found in northern South America: Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, and French Guiana. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical swampland. Description It is a medium-sized to large bird, medium slate-grey in colour, with contrasting bright white horizontal banding on its tail feathers. It has a medium-white breast with vertical black markings. It has a large orange cere at the base of its beak, and large yellow eyes.  Distribution  The slate-colored hawk inhabits parts of the Amazon basin, the Orinoco region, and French Guiana. Being a hunter of water edges for frogs, crabs, snakes, small mammals, etc., its main range is in a wide corridor along the main course of the Amazon River in the central Amazon basin. This corridor is about 700 km wide, and includes the confluence areas downstream of the major rivers: Rio Negro, Madeira, Tapajós, Xingu, and the outlet section of the Tocantins River in the southeast Basin's neighbouring river system, Araguaia-Tocantins. The upstream range widens into the southwestern and northwestern Basin to the Andean foothills, and from the south includes northern Amazonian Bolivia, eastern Peru and Ecuador, and southeastern Amazonian Colombia. In the extreme northwest, the range narrows to include only central-northeastern Colombia, and a mid-river section of the Orinoco River drainage of central-southwestern Venezuela (the section of the Colombia-Venezuela border). The slate-colored hawk is absent from the north-central Amazon basin, and the Guiana Shield to the Guianan coast; the species does range into French Guiana in the northeast, from the Amazon River outlet north through Brazil's Amapá state, as well as Marajó Island.

Description The gabar goshawk is polymorphic and occurs in two distinct forms which fluctuate in relative abundance across the geographic range of the species. The more frequent, paler form has mostly grey upperparts with a conspicuous, white rump and white and grey barring on the chest, thighs and underwings, and a dark grey, barred tail. In contrast, the less frequent form, which accounts on average for approximately 25 percent of the overall population, is almost completely black. In both forms of adult the eyes are dark, and the long legs and the cere are red. The cere and the legs are yellow in immatures and the plumage is generally browner, with the pale birds having untidy barring on the chest than the adult. The females are significantly larger than the males, the male's weigh 90 - 173g and the females 167 - 240g The body length is 28–36 cm and the wingspan 63 cm. Distribution and subspecies The gabar goshawk is found in sub-Saharan Africa, extending to Arabian Peninsula. These subspecies are currently recognised: *M. g. aequatorius: highlands of Ethiopia to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Zambia, and northern Mozambique *M. g. gabar: southern Angola to Zambia, Mozambique, and South Africa *M. g. niger: Senegambia to Sudan, northern Ethiopia and southwestern Arabia Habitat The gabar goshawk occurs in open woodland, especially dry Acacia savanna and broad-leaved woodland, with miombo (Brachystegia), cluster-leaf Terminalia, and mopane (Colosphermum mopane). In the more arid regions of southern Africa such as the Karoo and Namib Desert, it is generally restricted to tree-lined watercourses, but it may also move into cities and towns. Biology The gabar goshawk is usually considered to be sedentary, but immature birds are somewhat nomadic and some small migratory movements have been recorded in parts of its range. It is most frequently observed alone, but pairs are also common, particularly during the breeding season, when the male is often observed pursuing the female through trees, or calling from his perch. The small platform nest is typically constructed using thin twigs and positioned in a vertical fork in the crown of a thorny tree, such as an acacia. One notable aspect of their nest construction is that the birds collect spider webs including the live spiders, the spiders spin new webs which may help camouflage the nest, and the spiders may consume arthropods that would parasitize the chicks. The eggs are laid from July to December, peaking in September to November. The normal clutch is two eggs, but up to four may be laid, and these are mainly incubated by the female for about 33–38 days. Once hatched, the chicks are brooded by the female for the first 19–21 days of their lives, while the male brings her food to feed to them. They leave the nest around 35–36 days old, becoming fully independent about one month later. Small birds are the major part of the gabar goshawk's diet, with small mammals, reptiles, and insects also taken on occasion. The prey is typically flushed from trees and caught following a persistent and energetic pursuit. The gabar goshawk sometimes hunts from the perch, swooping down to catch prey off the ground or in flight. They have also been recorded attacking the nests of colonial birds such as weavers by clawing their way destructively through the nest top to snatch the chicks from the nest. Known predators of the gabar goshawk include tawny eagles, Wahlberg's eagles, and Ayres's hawk-eagles.

History The old name for the site of the lock was \\"Top of Caps\\" and the first suggestion for a lock at \\"Capps\\" was in 1770. In 1822 the lock cut and lock were built by the Thames Navigation Commissioners, considerably shortening the navigation and towpath.

A small 200kW hydroelectric generation station was installed in 2011 to supply electricity to Windsor Castle.Proposals for hydro power scheme The Queen demonstrates her power Daily Telegraph, 23 November 2013 History The first proposal for a pound lock was in 1774 which was to be further upstream at Firework Ait by Windsor Bridge. However nothing happened until the lock was opened on the present site in 1797, built of oak. There was no weir at the site previously and because of protests, none was built at that time. Barges were still liable to pay the lock fee even if they used the other channel. By the following year a weir was found to be indispensable, and so it was built. The lock was rebuilt by the Thames Conservancy in 1869 and the weir was rebuilt further upstream at the beginning of the 20th century.Fred. S. Thacker The Thames Highway: Volume II Locks and Weirs 1920 - republished 1968 David & Charles The lock was rebuilt again in 1979/80. Access to the lock The lock can be reached from Windsor down a long single track road which starts from the car park behind Windsor and Eton Riverside railway station. Reach above the lock Windsor from the river Eton College is on the left bank, beyond Cutler's Ait immediately upstream of which is the compact town Eton itself where Windsor Bridge crosses. On the Windsor bank the river skirts the town centre and set close to it upstream of Windsor Bridge is an islet, the smallest named on the Thames, Firework Ait and similarly Deadwater Ait. Just upstream of the islets are the Isambard Kingdom Brunel-designed Windsor Railway Bridge for the second railway serving the town which crosses Baths Island, and the late 20th century road bridge Queen Elizabeth Bridge. Cuckoo Weir Stream is a short backwater taking a left bank route under Queen Elizabeth Bridge -- on the right bank associated with Clewer is the confluence of the Clewer Mill Stream. The main river then has a sharp Z-bend near Windsor Racecourse, then continues past open fields near the village of Eton Wick before it reaches Boveney Lock. Rowing on the reach has been reduced by the 2006 creation of Dorney Lake in the ancient and modern civil and eccesiastical parishes Dorney. ;Thames Path The Thames Path follows the track on the south bank to Windsor and then crosses Windsor Bridge to the north (Eton) side, where it continues to Boveney Lock.

It is sometimes called Isidor's eagle. It is often placed in the monotypic genus Oroaetus. However, recent genetic testing indicates that this species is fairly closely related to Spizaetus species and thus the species has been found inclusive with the latter genera.Lerner, H., Christidis, L., Gamauf, A., Griffiths, C., Haring, E., Huddleston, C.J., Kabra, S., Kocum, A., Krosby, M., Kvaloy, K., Mindell, D., Rasmussen, P., Rov, N., Wadleigh, R., Wink, M. & Gjershaug, J.O. (2017). Phylogeny and new taxonomy of the Booted Eagles (Accipitriformes: Aquilinae). Zootaxa, 4216(4), 301-320.  Description  This is a fairly large eagle at long with a wingspan of . It is largest current member of the genus Spizaetus, with the smallest males somewhat larger than the largest female ornate hawk- eagles.Vuilleumier, F., & Ewert, D. N. (1978). The distribution of birds in Venezuelan páramos. Bulletin of the AMNH; v. 162, article 2. As an adult, this species is glossy black on the head and the back and a streaky chestnut on the underside, much of the wing primaries and legs. The juvenile bird is very different, being whitish over the head and body with a buffy wash underneath and scaly gray on the back and wings.  Ecology  Nest building is February and March, laying eggs in April and May and fledgling young by August and September. It builds a huge stick nest about 2 m (6.6 ft) across and 1 m (3.3 ft) deep. Clutches include 1 to 2 fledglings. At the nest area, adults primarily bring squirrels to their young. In Argentina, it was recorded that the female visited the nest more times and invested more time into nest building than males do. The female was responsible for the incubation and incubated every night in Argentina, while the male provided preys for both and briefly incubated when the female went out of the nest. After hatching, the female does all of the chick covering, feeding and defense were only carried out by the female, whereas the male provided prey. These are typical parental behaviors by raptors and eagles, but seem somewhat more rigidly divided in this species as the male never appears to take on brooding responsibilities in the black-and-chestnut eagle.Larrea, M., Gallego, D., Aráoz, R., & Grande, J. M. First results on parental care of the black-and-chestnut eagle (Spizaetus isidori) in the Yungas area of Jujuy. They are known to prey on woolly monkeys, possibly other monkeys including capuchins, porcupines, coatis, squirrels and other small-to-mid-sized arboreal mammals.Mcgraw, W. S., & Berger, L. R. (2013). Raptors and primate evolution. Evolutionary Anthropology: Issues, News, and Reviews, 22(6), 280-293. Large birds such as guans are also seemingly often taken. They frequently have much abraded tails by plunging after prey through the branches. They overlap in range with several other large forest eagles, including other Spizaetus eagles, but few interactions have been reported and, as they often occur at slightly different altitudes than other neotropic forest eagles, the black-and-chestnut eagle is believed to be normally the top avian predator in its range. One exception is the similarly sized solitary eagle, which preliminary reports suggests mostly hunts snakes, whereas the black-and-chestnut eagle seems to prefer birds and small-to-mid-sized mammals, and the two species were observed flying near each other without aggression in southeastern Peru since prey partitioning appears to allow them to co-exist.Valdez, Ursula, and Sophie Osborn. Observations on the ecology of the Black-and-chestnut Eagle (Oroaetus isidori) in a montane forest of southeastern Peru. Ornitologıa Neotropical 15 (2004): 31-40. One species seen to be aggressively displaced by the black-and-chestnut eagles here was the turkey vulture, possibly because they sometimes steal eggs from bird's nests. Black-and-chestnut eagles sometimes hunt chickens, including standard-sized adults, which has caused some persecution of this endangered species. One small dietary study was conducted in Colombia, however, found that chickens made up 14.7% while wild Andean guans were much more frequently taken, making up 53.9% of the diet. Also, here the black-and-chestnut eagles took about the same number of western mountain coatis as they did chickens, and coatis are known predators of poultry chicks and eggs.Zuluaga, S., & Echeverry-Galvis, M.

It is generally local and rare. Widespread cutting of primary forest in foothills throughout the Andes is the primary cause of the precipitous decline of this species. There may be only 370-1500 individuals of black-and-chestnut eagles left in the wild (and 250-999 mature individuals), fewer than previously thought.

Boveney is a village a little way upstream on the same side. The lock was first built in 1838 by the Thames Navigation Commission. The lock was rebuilt in 1898 closer to the Buckinghamshire bank, and a set of boat rollers were installed on the old site. The weir is almost parallel to the lock, running across from the other side of the lock island. History Although the river below Maidenhead was supposed to be clear of weirs, there is record of a weir and flash lock at Gill's bucks a short way upstream of the present site. There were suggestions of a pound lock here as early as 1780, and various plans for a lock were proposed in 1820. These plans proposed cuts to the mouth of Clewer Mill Stream because of difficult navigation of the tight bends downstream. However, the present location was eventually chosen, with a timber lock built in 1838. With the regular traffic of boats from Eton College to Queen's Eyot, a temporary boat slide was built in 1895, which became permanent on the site of the old lock when a new lock was built immediately to the side in 1898. The weir was rebuilt in about 1913.Fred. S.

In 1947, he completed college in Zürich under Johannes Itten, the inventor of a \\"color sphere\\". Afterwards he began training until 1949 as a lithographer with Orell Fuessli (Zürich); later he studied in Italy, Greece and Czechoslovakia. Career One of the deer lamps on Ueltiberg mountain Weber extended his Bruno Weber Park (a sculpture garden) in Spreitenbach and Dietikon, where among other things, his house with a 25m high tower is situated. The park extends over a surface of 20'000 m². The sculpture park is the synthesis of the artist's life work, and is visited annually by thousands of people. From 1991 to 2003 Weber was responsible for the sculptural decorations on the Uetliberg mountain, including the street lamps leading to the top of Zürich plateau (Uto Kulm) and park benches, that still exist. Weber co-operated with Zürich architect Justus Dahinden, making sculptures for buildings in Dahinden, Vienna and Zürich. He discovered his passion for three-dimensional sculptures after thirty years of painting. On the basis of his paintings, development can be recognized contrary to his sculptures, which orients itself to Cézanne and Gubler. In 2006, the municipalities of Spreitenbach and Dietikon inaugurated a road – Bruno Weber Weg – leading from Dietikon railway station to the Bruno Weber Park.

Religious importance  Cave Temple of Amarnath The stalagmite formations present in most natural limestone caves resemble Shiva Linga, a representation of Hindu God Shiva, due to which some of the caves in India are considered of religious import. In addition, several universally known caves related to Buddhism is also exist in India. The same attraction leads local people to visit small caves as it draws tourists to large show caves. In India, Amarnath Temple caves, Vaishno Devi Mandir, Badami Cave Temples, Hulimavu Shiva cave temple, Mahakali Caves, Mandapeshwar Caves, Pandavleni Caves are some of the caves with religious importance.  Current research  Jayant Biswas and his contemporaries continue to research the biospeleology of Meghalaya, Chhattisgarh, Uttarakhand and Western Ghats to establish India amongst other notable countries on the cave map of the world. Research is also taking place on Indian cave stalagmites, to estimate the past monsoon climate. Dr Ashish Sinha of California State University is taking major steps to understand the past pattern of Indian monsoons via cave research. In addition, Prof. Rengaswamy Ramesh; Dr. M. G.

Description The Madagascan harrier-hawk is a largish raptor with long and broad wings which when folded almost reach to the tip of the tail. It has a black tail with a single broad grey band bisecting the black half way along its length, Adult birds are grey above with blackish flight feathers. The underparts are white with dense dark barring on the breast, belly and underwing coverts while the upper breast and throat are the same colour as the upperparts and form a grey hood, broken by the yellow face. The bill is yellow with a black tip and the legs are yellow. Distribution The Madagascan harrier-hawk is quite widespread and common, albeit in small numbers, in most regions of Madagascar but it is scarce on the deforested central plateau. It can be found from sea level to altitude. Habitat The Madagascan harrier- hawk occurs in a variety of habitats but seems to favour undisturbed lowland rainforest. It has also been recorded from montane rainforest, spiny desert scrub, degraded forests and other wooded habitats, including plantations of exotic trees. Habits The nest of the Madagascan harrier-hawk is a large, bulky structure which is constructed using sticks and situated approximately above the ground within the canopy of a tree. Nesting has been observed the months of September, October, and November. The eggs are brooded by both sexes and hatch asynchronously, with the older sibling often killing its younger brood mates. Fledging takes about seven weeks. On at least one occasion a nest was found within a colony of Sakalava weavers. The Madagascan harrier-hawk has a varied diet and has been recorded eating small birds, rodents, reptiles, insects, small lemurs. Like the African harrier-hawk they possess the unusual morphological adaptation of having an intertarsal joint that allows their legs to flex backwards and forwards. This means that they can use their feet to probe and remove prey from hidden sites such as holes in tree trunks, weaver nests and rock crevices where they can extract nestling birds from such normally inaccessible places. Taxonomic notes The Madagascan harrier-hawk forms a superspecies with the African harrier-hawk and has been regarded by some authorities as a subspecies of that species. However, if that is the case then the combined species would be called P. radiatus as this name has priority.

It occurs in western, central and (very locally) eastern Africa.  Description  The adult Cassin's hawk-eagle has dark brown upperparts, with white spots and a brown tail with three black bars and a broad black subterminal band. The tarsi are white with black streaks, and the underparts are white with black blotches along the sides of the lower breast. It has yellowish brown eyes, the cere and feet are pale yellowish and the bill is black. Juvenile birds are brown on the head with dark brown wings which have white-tipped secondary feathers. The underparts are white, with rufous on the breast while the belly and flanks are marked with dense black spotting. The tail is dark gray with a white tip and dark barring. In flight the juvenile shows pale underwing coverts whereas and adult has dark underwing coverts and a black band along the rear edge of the wing. This a fairly small eagle and, under current classification, is the smallest member of the Aquila genus. It measures in length and has a wingspan of , and weigh . Distribution and habitat West, central and marginally east Africa; from Sierra Leone east to western Uganda south through the Congo Basin to northern Angola. Cassin's hawk-eagle is restricted to primary rainforest. Habits The details of the ecology and behaviour of Cassin's hawk-eagle are little known as it is a secretive and rarely seen species, usually seen when soaring over the forest canopy. The nest is constructed with sticks and situated in the canopy of a tree and is lined with fresh foliage. The clutch size is 1-2 eggs which are laid from October–December in Ghana and Gabon, and in December in Uganda. When the stomach contents of collected specimens have been examined they have been found to contain the remains of birds and tree squirrels. Conservation status Cassin's hawk-eagle is currently categorised as Least Concern by BirdLife International. Despite a decreasing population, estimated at 1,000-10,000 individuals, Cassin's hawk- eagles has a large geographic range and its population decline is not severe enough for it to given Vulnerable status. Taxonomy Cassin's hawk-eagle was formerly allocated to the genera Cassinaetus, Hieraaetus, and Spizaetus. It was moved to Hieraeetus when Spizaetus was restricted to Neotropical hawk eagles. Recent molecular studies have shown that Cassin's hawk-eagle forms a clade with the larger booted eagles of the genus Aquila. There is still some work being done on booted eagle phylogeny so this may change in the future. In 2017, a group of researchers proposed that the official English name be changed from \\"Cassin's hawk-eagle\\" to \\"Cassin's eagle\\", so that the term hawk- eagle could be restricted to current members of Spizaetus and Niseatus.

It is found throughout a large part of tropical America, from southern Mexico to northern Argentina. Description As its name suggest, this is a black and white eagle, resembling the small typical eagles sometimes separated in \\"Hieraaetus\\". It is some 20–24 in (50–60 cm) long overall and weighs about 30 oz (850 g). The head, neck and body are white; a small crest forms a black spot on top of the head, and the area around the eyes, particularly towards the bill, is also black. The wings are black with a noticeable white leading edge, and the bird has a brownish tail barred black- dark grey and with white tip. The iris is orange in adults and greyish in juveniles, the feet pale to bright yellow with black talons. The bill is black with a yellow cere. The sexes are alike in color, but the female is larger. Immature birds have pale edges on the upper wing coverts and some brownish- grey feathers on the back. The black-and-white hawk-eagle is hard to confuse with any other bird in its range with the exception of juvenile Grey-headed Kites. These birds are known to mimic several species of hawk-eagles. The black-faced hawk (Leucopternis melanops) is very similar in overall coloration, but it is much smaller and has a black tail with a single bold white bar in the middle. The ornate hawk-eagle (Spizaetus ornatus), presumably a very close relative of S. melanoleucus, looks quite similar when young. However, the wings, back and tail are much lighter in young S. ornatus, and they do not have the black eye-ring. Distribution and ecology This species occurs from Oaxaca to Veracruz in southern Mexico southwards throughout Central America, with the exception of most of El Salvador and the Pacific coast of Nicaragua. In South America, it occurs on the Pacific side of the Andes south to Ecuador. The bulk of its range extends along the Caribbean coast from northern Colombia and Venezuela to the Guianas, and south through eastern Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay to NE Argentina, and from there westwards again to Beni and Santa Cruz in NE Bolivia. A black-and-white hawk-eagle population is also found in the Loreto Region of NE Peru; it is not known in how far this is isolated from the rest of the bird's range. The species is absent from the western Amazon basin, and even though it might not common in the lands to the east (e.g. in Minas Gerais), there has been at least one nest described in the region. Its natural habitats are lowland forests of any type, though very dense and humid as well as savanna-like semiarid habitat are not preferred. Habitat fragmentation is not very well tolerated; though the species prefers a diverse habitat of mixed forest and shrubland, it requires large stands of closed-canopy forest to thrive. Its range does not extend very far into the uplands, but one individual was sighted at an altitude of about 4,000 ft (c.1,200 m) ASL in the Buena Vista Nature Reserve in Colombia's Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta. The food of this carnivore consists of mammals, toads, squamates and in particular a wide variety of birds. Among the latter, it is known to prefer tree-living species, such as oropendolas, aracaris, tanagers and cotingas. But ground- and waterbirds like tinamous, chachalacas, cormorants and the highly threatened Brazilian merganser (Mergus octosetaceus) have also been recorded as its prey. The black-and-white hawk-eagle has been known to attack small monkeys, though it is not clear with which intent. For as it seems, it has not been recorded to actually kill and eat a monkey. Its preferred hunting technique is to soar high until it has spotted suitable prey, and then dive down on it, usually right into the forest canopy, but it has also been observed to catch a white woodpecker (Melanerpes candidus) that had been mobbing it in mid-air, after launching itself from its perch. It likes to hunt along ridges and forest edges where it can access the canopy- level from an oblique direction rather than just from directly above, and where ground-living prey is also more accessible. A rescued animal, photo taken in captivity in Argentina It nests in the forest canopy, building a stick nest high up in exposed trees on ridges and similar locations, from where good hunting grounds can be watched. Detailed observations on its nesting habits are escarce. In Brazil, researchers found and described a nest in 2006 in Southeast Brazil, and in 2009 researchers found and studied two nests in Belize. In Panama, birds started to construct a nest in September, during a dry spell in the rainy season. But the main nesting season may start before the onset of the rainy season as the nesting attempt was abandoned when heavy rains recommenced. The scant other data agrees with this, and at least in Central America the nesting season seems to run from March to June or so. There is a general lack of information on the black-and-white hawk-eagle's movements and population status. Each bird seems to require a hunting territory of about 3,500 acres (1,400 hectares) at least. While the variety of habitat types in which it is found suggests that it is not particularly susceptible to changes in land use, it is apparently still a rare and local species almost anywhere in its range. The IUCN until 2000 classified it as a Near Threatened species due to the uncertainties surrounding its status, but as no evidence of a marked decline has been found and as the bird is found across a wide range, it was downlisted to a Species of Least Concern. Taxonomy and systematics This species is often placed in the monotypic genus Spizastur, but has recently been moved to Spizaetus e.g. by the American Ornithologists' Union, as it appears that the ornate hawk-eagle (S. ornatus) is its sister taxon. This has created quite some taxonomic confusion, which has largely gone unnoticed however: Originally, the name Spizaetus melanoleucus was given by Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot to the black-chested buzzard-eagle in 1819, while the black-and-white hawk-eagle had been described in 1816 by the very same scientist as Buteo melanoleucus. The former species was placed in Geranoaetus – also a monotypic genus – in 1844, while the black- and-white hawk-eagle had been moved out of Buteo and into Spizastur a few years earlier. Thus, the identical specific epithets never came into direct conflict until recently. But the black-chested eagle-buzzard's placement in a monotypic genus was always disputed, and several authors treated it in Buteo. However, they overlooked that Buteo melanoleucus was the original name of the black-and-white hawk-eagle and thus as a senior homonym could not be applied to the later-described species. The correct specific name for the black- chested eagle-buzzard when placed in Buteo, Buteo fuscescens, was reestablished in the mid-20th century for a short time more by accident than anything else; as most late-20th-century researchers argued for retaining Geranoaetus, this name was dismissed as erroneous and essentially forgotten. As the black-and-white hawk-eagle has not been placed in Buteo since long, Article 59.3 of the ICZN Code applies. According to this, a junior homonym replaced before 1961 is not rendered permanently invalid (as junior homonyms usually are) if \\"the substitute name is not in use\\" – which has been the case after Amadon's 1963 revision. Hence, in this case the scientific name Buteo melanoleucus can apply to the black-chested eagle-buzzard, even though the black-and-white hawk-eagle was described under exactly that name earlier, while the senior homonym melanoleucus still applies to the latter species when placed in Spizaetus according to the usual ICZN rules. Consequently, the proper name to use for each bird has through a number of coincidences become the senior synonym of the other species.

They warn him that because of his looks, he will be shunned by the world, and an angry mob will be the last thing he will see before he dies. Some years later, an embittered, grown up Shrek is living contentedly alone in a swamp (\\"Big, Bright, Beautiful World\\"). However, his solitude is disrupted when a refugee caravan of fairytale creatures show up on his property. They explain of their banishment from the Kingdom of Duloc, by order of the evil Lord Farquaad, who sentenced them into penal transportation for being freaks, under penalty of death if they ever return (\\"Story of my Life\\"). Although hesitant, Shrek decides to travel to see Farquaad and try to regain his swamp, along with getting the Fairytale Creatures their homes back, with much encouragement from Pinocchio and the gang (\\"The Goodbye Song\\"). Along the way, Shrek rescues a talkative Donkey from some of Farquaad's guards. In return for rescuing him, and offering his friendship, Donkey insists on tagging along to show him the way to Duloc, which Shrek reluctantly agrees to, due to him being lost (\\"Don't Let Me Go\\"). Meanwhile, in the Kingdom of Duloc, Farquaad is torturing The Gingerbread Man into revealing the whereabouts of other Fairytale Creatures that are still hiding in his Kingdom so he can have them arrested as well. Just as Gingy was going to reveal what he knows, the Captain of the guards arrives and announces that they have found the Magic Mirror. Farquaad asked the mirror if Duloc was the most perfect kingdom of them all. The mirror told him that he's not truly a king yet, but he can become one if he marries a princess. For this episode of \\"This Is Your Wife\\" (a parody of The Dating Game), the mirror introduces three different princesses for Lord Farquaad to choose from: Cinderella, Snow White, and Princess Fiona; at the suggestion from his henchman, Thelonious, Farquaad chooses Princess Fiona, who is currently trapped in a castle surrounded by lava and guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Accepting this as a task, Farquaad decides to marry her to become king, and rushes out to plan a raffle to see which knight would be worthy enough to embark on a quest to retrieve Fiona before the Mirror can tell him what happens to her at night. The Mirror then shows the audience the story of Fiona's childhood. A seven-year-old Fiona dreams of the brave knight who, as her storybooks tell her, will one day rescue her from her tower and end her mysterious curse with \\"True Love's First Kiss\\". As she grows into a teenager, and then a headstrong woman, she becomes a little bit stir-crazy, but she never loses her faith in her fairytales (\\"I Know It's Today\\"). Shrek and Donkey arrive in Duloc where Farquaad expresses his love for his kingdom, accompanied by his cheerful cookie-cut army of Duloc Dancers (\\"What's Up Duloc?\\"). They approach Farquaad, with him being impressed by Shrek's size and appearance. Farquaad demands that Shrek must rescue Fiona, and in return, he will give Shrek the deed to his swamp. The two unlikely friends set off to find Fiona, with Shrek becoming increasingly annoyed with Donkey as time progresses (\\"Travel Song\\"). After crossing the rickety old bridge and arriving at the castle, Shrek sets off alone to rescue Fiona while Donkey encounters Dragon who initially wants to eat him, but then decides to spare him by keeping him for herself after Donkey manages to charm her (\\"Donkey Pot Pie\\"/\\"Forever\\"). When Shrek finds Fiona, his lack of interest in playing out her desired, romantic rescue scene annoys her, and he drags her off by force (\\"This is How a Dream Comes True\\"). The two of them reunite with Donkey, and all three attempt to escape while being chased by the angry Dragon and her skeleton minions. Shrek traps Dragon and they get to a safe point. Fiona then insists that Shrek reveal his identity and is shocked that her rescuer is an ogre and not the Prince Charming her stories indicated. Shrek explains that he is merely her champion; instead, she is to marry Farquaad. The trio begin their journey back to Duloc, but Fiona becomes apprehensive as the sun begins to set. She insists that they rest for the night and that she spend the night alone in a nearby cave. Donkey and Shrek remain awake, with Donkey asking Shrek who he would be, if he did not have to be an ogre anymore. As Shrek opens up to Donkey on who he would wish to be, Fiona transforms into an ogress as part of her curse that happens during sunset, stands apart, alone, and listens (\\"Who I'd Be\\"). Act II The next day, Princess Fiona rises early and sings with a bluebird and dances with a deer (before making the bird explode and throwing the deer off a cliff). She assists the Pied Piper in his rat-charming duties (\\"Morning Person\\"). Shrek brings down her mood by attempting to give subtle hints about her groom-to-be (\\"Men of Farquaad's stature are in short supply\\", \\"He's very good at small talk\\", etc.) and mocking her tragic childhood circumstances. The two begin a contest of trying to one-up each other to outdo the others' backstory, but end up revealing their respective pasts (\\"I Think I Got You Beat\\"). Both admit to being thrown out by their parents; this connection, as well as bonding over a love of disgusting bodily noises, kindles friendship. Back in Duloc, Lord Farquaad was in his bathtub planning his wedding, and he reveals his own sordid heritage after The Magic Mirror insists that Farquaad should invite his father, but Farquaad refuses, explaining how he abandoned him in the woods as a child (\\"The Ballad of Farquaad\\"). As Shrek and Fiona's newfound camaraderie grows into love, Donkey insists, with the help of the Three Blind Mice from his imagination, that Shrek should gather his courage and romantically engage Fiona (\\"Make a Move\\"). Shrek, finally beginning to come out of his caustic, protective shell, tries to find the words to explain his feelings to Fiona (\\"When Words Fail\\"). While Shrek is out finding a flower for Fiona, Donkey discovers that Fiona turns into an ogress at night, and she confesses that she was cursed as a child, which is why she was locked away in the tower. Only a kiss from her true love will return her to her proper form, and she asks Donkey to promise never to tell. Shrek arrives near the end of the conversation and misunderstands Fiona's description of herself as an ugly beast, and thinks she is talking about him. Hurt by her presumed opinion, Shrek storms off. The next day, transformed back to her human form, Fiona decides to tell Shrek about her curse (\\"Morning Person (Reprise)\\"). When she tries to explain, Shrek rebuffs her with his \\"ugly beast\\" overhearing, causing Fiona in turn to misunderstand. Then Farquaad arrives to claim Fiona and tells Shrek he has cleared the swamp of the Fairytale Creatures, and now belongs to Shrek again. While not very impressed with Farquaad, Fiona agrees to marry him and insists that they have the wedding before sunset. As Farquaad and Fiona ride back to Duloc, Donkey tries to explain the misunderstanding to Shrek (who is too angry and upset to listen), and Shrek rejects him as well, declaring that he will return to his swamp alone and build a wall to shield himself from the world (\\"Build a Wall\\"). Meanwhile, the Fairytale Creatures are on their way to a landfill which is to be their new home, since they were forced to relocate from the swamp. After dealing with the fact that Shrek broke his promise to them, however, Gingy rants that Farquaad's treatment of them is intolerable; just because they are freaks does not mean they deserve to be hated, so he rallies most of the other fairytale creatures into staging a coup d'état against Farquaad's rule. Unfortunately, a bitter Pinocchio (remembering they are not allowed back to Duloc) who doesn't want his friends to get killed, suggests that they should just keep going and wait until everything gets better, all the while wishing to be a real boy. Exasperated by Pinocchio's turndown, Gingy convinces him to join the protest, inspiring him to accept who he is, as all of them have accepted who they are. They gather new confidence and strength in themselves, as they declare that they'll raise their \\"Freak Flag\\" high against their tormentors (\\"Freak Flag\\"). Now realizing that they have become something more than friends, and have become a family, Pinocchio now leads his gang back to Duloc to overthrow Farquaad once and for all. Shrek has returned to his once again private swamp, but he misses Fiona. Donkey shows up attempting to seal off his half of the swamp with stone boulders, which Shrek rebuffs. In turn, Donkey angrily berates Shrek for his reclusive and stubborn habits, even to the point of driving off Fiona. An angered Shrek reveals he heard her talking about a hideous creature the night before, and Donkey retorts that they were not talking about him, but of \\"someone else\\". When a confused Shrek inquires who it was, Donkey, wanting to keep his promise, and still cross with Shrek, refuses to talk. When Shrek apologizes and extends his friendship, Donkey forgives him. The two then go back to Duloc, where Shrek objects to this marriage before Farquaad can kiss Fiona, and Fiona convinces him to let Shrek speak with her. Shrek finally finds the words to express his feelings for Fiona, and he declares his love for her (\\"Big Bright Beautiful World (Reprise)\\"). However, his declaration of love is mocked by Farquaad. Caught between love and her desire to break the curse, Fiona tries to escape the event. Just then, the Fairytale Creatures storm into the wedding and protest their banishment. They are also accompanied by Grumpy, one of the Seven Dwarfs, who reveals that he is Farquaad's father, and he kicked Farquaad out at the age of 28 when he wouldn't move out of the basement, revealing Farquaad is a freak as well. During the scuffle, the sun sets, causing Fiona to turn into an ogress in front of everyone. Farquaad, furious and disgusted over the change, orders for Shrek to be drawn and quartered along with the Fairytale Creatures and Fiona banished back to her tower. As Farquaad proclaims himself the new King, Shrek whistles for the Dragon, who has now escaped the castle (and is the reason Shrek and Donkey got to the wedding just in time). Dragon then crashes through the window with Donkey and incinerates Farquaad with her fiery breath. With Farquaad dead, Shrek and Fiona admit their love for each other and share true love's first kiss. Fiona's curse is broken, and she takes her true form: an ogress. At first, she is ashamed of her looks, but Shrek declares that she is still beautiful. The two ogres begin a new life together (along with Donkey, Dragon, and the Fairytale Creatures) as everyone celebrates their liberation against Farquaad's rule (\\"This Is Our Story\\"). In the end, Shrek and Fiona (in association with Donkey and Dragon) host their post-wedding party (\\"I'm A Believer\\").

Reception The musical has received mixed to positive reviews from critics. Ben Brantley wrote in The New York Times: \\"'Shrek,' for the record, is not bad.... As the title character, a misanthropic green ogre who learns to love, the talented Mr. James is... encumbered with padding and prosthetics.... As the evil, psychologically maimed Lord Farquaad, the very droll Christopher Sieber is required to walk on his knees, with tiny fake legs dangling before him — an initially funny sight gag that soon drags\\". He praises Sutton Foster as \\"an inspired, take-charge musical comedian.... Ms. Foster manages both to make fun of and exult in classical musical-comedy moves while creating a real, full character at the same time.\\"Brantley, Ben. \\"The Belching Green Ogre Has a Song in His Heart\\", The New York Times, December 15, 2008. Variety noted that the production had a reported budget of $24 million. Any \\"theme-park cutesiness is offset by the mischievous humor in David Lindsay-Abaire's book and lyrics. The production's real achievement, however, is that the busy visuals and gargantuan set-pieces never overwhelm the personalities of the actors or their characters. The ensemble is talented and the four leads, in particular, couldn't be better.\\"Rooney, David. \\"Shrek the Musical\\", Variety, December 14, 2008. The Associated Press said that \\"the folks at DreamWorks have done their darndest to make sure we are entertained at Shrek the Musical, the company's lavish stage adaptation of its hit animated movie. For much of the time, they succeed, thanks to the talent and ingratiating appeal of the show's four principal performers. The show's massive sets and colorful costumes (both courtesy of Tim Hatley) are so visually eye-catching that they often distract from what's going on with the story and score. Composer Jeanine Tesori has written attractive, eclectic, pop-flavored melodies that range from a jaunty 'Travel Song' to a gutsy duet called 'I Got You Beat' for Shrek and Fiona that revels in rude noises.\\" The review also noted that Lindsay-Abaire's lyrics are often fun and quite witty.Kuchwara, Michael, \\"A mean green ogre named Shrek moves to Broadway\\", Associated Press, December 14, 2008. USA Today gave the show three and a half stars out of four, writing: \\"Shrek, which draws from William Steig's book about a lovable ogre and the DreamWorks animated movie that it inspired, is nonetheless a triumph of comic imagination with a heart as big and warm as Santa's. It is the most ingeniously wacky, transcendently tasteless Broadway musical since The Producers, and more family-friendly than that gag-fest.\\" The review also noted, however, that \\"Like other musical adaptations of hit films, Shrek... leans heavily on winking satire. There are the usual nods to more fully realized shows, from Gypsy to A Chorus Line, and Jeanine Tesori's blandly ingratiating score doesn't feature any songs you're likely to be humming 20 years from now.\\"Gardner, Elysa. \\"On Broadway, 'Shrek the Musical' is a gas, gas, gas\\", Usatoday.com, December 14, 2008.

Paclitaxel kills cancer cells by preventing the normal breakdown of microtubules during cell division. In this formulation, paclitaxel is bonded to albumin as a delivery vehicle. It is manufactured and sold in the United States by Celgene under the trade name Abraxane where it is designated as an orphan drug as first-line treatment, in combination with gemcitabine, for the orphan disease \\"metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas\\". This treatment was approved in the United States in 2005, and the European Union in 2008, for breast cancer cases where cancer did not respond to other chemotherapy or has relapsed. In 2012, the FDA widened the approved uses to include treatment for NSCLC. In 2013, the FDA approved protein-bound paclitaxel for use in treating advanced pancreatic cancer as a less toxic (although less effective) alternative to FOLFIRINOX. Society and culture Abraxane is registered on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods for the treatment of metastatic carcinoma of the breast after failure of anthracycline therapy. Abraxane is also included on the Schedule of the Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme although the manufacturer was unable to convince the independent Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee that the drug warranted a higher price than existing comparator drugs. Protein-bound paclitaxel was developed by VivoRx which became Abraxis BioScience as the first in its class of drugs to use the nanoparticle albumin bound (nab) technology platform. In 2010, Abraxis was acquired by Celgene, which now markets Abraxane. Total revenue from the sales of Abraxane for 2009 were $314.5 million. In 2013, Abraxane was FDA approved for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. In 2014, Abraxane's sales were $848 million, 31 percent year-over-year increase. The British National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) announced in 2015, that it would not support the routine use of protein-bound paclitaxel in advanced pancreatic cancer on the NHS.

It is located next to the large St Helier council estate and close to the major intersection known as Rosehill. The hospital offers a full range of hospital services including a 24-hour accident and emergency department. The site is also home to the South West Renal and Transplantation Service and the Queen Mary's Hospital for Children, a dedicated children's hospital. St Helier Hospital is a major teaching hospital for St George's, University of London, and is a main teaching site for medical degrees. History A ward at St Helier Hospital in 1943 The art deco entrance of St Helier Hospital floodlit at night in 2009 The hospital was commissioned in 1934 when Surrey County Council acquired a 999-year lease of 10 acres of land on the St Helier council estate which had been named in honour of Mary Jeune, Baroness St Helier, a prominent alderman on the London County Council. Queen Mary laid the foundation stone for the new hospital on 26 March 1938. It was designed by Saxon Snell & Phillips, who were chosen for their experience in hospital design, in the thirties modernist style. It received its first patients in February 1941 during Second World War. Less than a month later, the hospital was damaged in a bombing raid by a parachute mine. John Major, the former Prime Minister was born in the hospital in 1943.There is a plaque at the main entrance of the hospital stating this. Further damage was caused in later raids and the hospital was struck by two flying bombs in June 1944. St Helier Hospital remained functional throughout the War and was painted green to make it less visible to German bombers in the latter years of the war. It joined the National Health Service in 1948. The Queen Mother visited the hospital in 1963, during the hospital's jubilee year and, in 1987, Diana Princess of Wales opened the new maternity unit. Services were transferred from Queen Mary's Hospital for Children in 1993. St Helier Hospital came under the management of the Epsom and St Helier University Hospitals NHS Trust in 1999. In November 2013, as part of the Better Services Better Value Review of NHS services in London, the Trust proposed the downgrading of the maternity and Accident and Emergency Departments. Services The main building is divided into three blocks: A, B and C. The other buildings are: * The pathology block (labelled D) which also contains the genitourinary medicine clinic * The Women's Health Block (labelled E) (which contains the maternity and gynaecology wards, gynaecology clinics and delivery suite) * Ferguson House (labelled F) (contains some outpatient clinics, administration departments and undergraduate teaching suite) * Queen Mary's Hospital for Children (labelled J) * The renal block (labelled K) Transport links The nearest London Underground station is Morden Underground station, from which there are frequent buses to the hospital via Rose Hill (about 5 minutes walk from the hospital). Some of the buses that stop outside the hospital are the 151, 157, S1 and S4. The nearest National Rail station is St Helier station which is slightly less than one mile from the hospital (about a 15-minute walk), although this is infrequently served (only 1 train every 30 minutes off-peak).

Its coordinates are 34°21'59.99\\"N 73°14'60.00\\"E. It lies along the N-15 highway and is approximately 9 kilometres from Mansehra. General The dominant religion in Chitta Batta is Sunni Islam. The people in Chitta Batta are from the Swati caste. Their history dates back to when people from Swat Valley came, found it very favorable to live in, and settled down, capturing the land for themselves. Before their arrival, the land was disputed among two unknown tribes. The Swatis are known for their wealth and cleverness. Commonly known as \\"Khans\\", they are related to \\"Pathans\\". After settling, they scattered into different areas of Mansehra Valley. This village has a legendary story called \\"Hathi Gut\\" (Elephant Rock). The legend states that a marriage ceremony was held a long time ago, and a magician converted their caravan into rocks. One of these rocks is a sculpture of an elephant which can be easily seen at the entrance of the village. There are no clear signs of others. This village is organized into housing and agricultural land. The village population is mostly closer to the roads, and people living far from the road are predominantly farmers. They possess no land, but they rent it from landlords. They are called \\"Mazaraas\\", meaning tenants. Half of the yield goes to the farmers, along with any waste food, used for cattle. At one point, there was a pine forest, but due to the non-supply of natural gas, it has vanished. Wild animals present include rabbits and chickens. The village has two streams. The larger of these is located in between Chitta Batta and Sandasar village, while the smaller stream is named \\"Paan Da Nara\\". The people eat rice, cornbread, and saag from various plants. The literacy rate of the village is high as the residents have a great interest in education. During the earthquake in 2005, its population increased when many people migrated to the village. The local people were welcoming to the immigrants and provided the necessary support. A settlement was established to help victims, which looked after 800 outpatients per day. Later, a Turkish relief organization, the Turkish Light House, launched a project to build two schools in the area.

Its population was 17,176 as of 2014.Instituto Nacional de Estadistica Accessed March 21, 2013. It is in the northeast (specifically the Cinca Medio district of the province of Huesca) and adjoins the rivers Cinca and Sosa. Historical overview Prehistory and Old Age The first signs of constant human occupation in the area of Monzón come from Neolithic. There have been found some archaeological remains of that era on the deposits Sosiles Altos and Peña Lucas. Most vestiges of civilization come from the Bronze Age, where it is assumed that people settled in the area between the rivers Cinca, Sosa and clamor. The ilergetes were the people occupying these areas, who were defeated in the 3rd century BC, producing the Romanization of the area from the 2nd century BC. In the hills of the Ermita de la Alegría (the shrine of Joy) and the cells were found remains of Roman dwellings, being this area a key point in the connections from the cities of Caesaraugusta or Osca with Italy .Galiay, J.: La dominación romana en Aragón; Zaragoza, 1946. Lostal, J.: Arqueología del Aragón romano; Zaragoza, 1980. Martín-Bueno, M.: Aragón Arqueológico; Zaragoza, 1977 Middle Ages Muslim Era At the time of Muslim domination Monzón was disputed by the Banu Sabrit from Huesca and Banu Qasi from Zaragoza. It belonged to the Banu Hud in the 11th century and was taken by El Cid in 1083. The Christians were interested to conquer Monzón in order to cut communications between the taifa kingdoms of Zaragoza and Lleida. The infant Pedro I reconquered Monzón in 1089 during the reign of his father Sancho Ramírez. Sancho Ramírez created the Kingdom of Monzón for the infant, future Pedro I, before he became king of Aragon. This situation lasted until 1126, when it reverted to Muslim hands for four years. Between 1130 and 1136 it was held by Christians, who lost the town in the period 1136-1141 to finally win her back.Ubieto 1981, p. 180. Already conquered by Sancho Ramirez and Pedro I, Ramón Berenguer III lost for treason in 1127, reconquered in 1130 1143 happened to belong to the Templars. Christian Era The Cathedral of Santa María del Romeral. The Cathedral de Santa María del Romeral (Saint Mary of the Rosemary Field), grew from the 9th century Torre del Homenaje which hosted kings and nobles. Here in 1109 Urraca of Castile married her second husband Alfonso I (\\"The Battler\\") despite the Church's objections concerning consanguinity. During medieval times Monzón was a stronghold of the Knights Templar because of its strategic location between the Segre and Cinca valleys. It was also as an important center for joint legislative sessions for the various segments of Aragon, especially between the 13th and 17th centuries because of its location between Zaragoza and Barcelona. The Teutonic Knights were also known to have had a commandery here since 1222. Dependencies of Monzón Castle During the 12th century Monzón was ruled by the infant Ramiro de Navarra, Tizón and García Ramírez before his proclamation as King of Navarre among others. When in 1143 the Knights Templar assigns its rights to the Crown of Aragon receives in exchange the Castle of Monzón among others, where the main task of the Crown of Aragon happened. The most historically important event in this period is the enforced residence of James I (\\"The Conqueror\\") who spent part of his youth in Monzón. After his father Peter II (\\"The Catholic\\") died in the Battle of Muret (1213); the Knights Templar in Monzon served as the young king's guardians and tutors. When the Pope Clement V extinguishes the Knights Templar, some parcels like Monzón resisted, and it was not until 1309 when it was conquered. In 1317 passes to sanjuanistas hands, although the hosts will lose its power gradually. Monzón also hosted numerous times the Cortes of the Crown of Aragon, between the 13th to 17th centuries. The Cathedral of Santa María del Romeral of Romanesque and the castle with its origins in the 9th century (Torre del Homenaje) welcomed the king and his nobles. Modern and Contemporary Age In this town the Cardinal Richelieu and Gaspar de Guzmán, Count-Duke of Olivares signed a treaty here, ending the conflict over Valtelline in 1626. During the Catalan Revolt Monzón was taken by the French- Catalan troops run by Philippe de La Mothe-Houdancourt in 1642 and, the following year, by the Castilian troops of Felipe da Silva. The Castle of Monzón is considered a strategic enclave, was also occupied by the French during the War of Independence and recovered in 1814 as national cause by the troops of General Copons in a bold ploy due to the Spanish military of Flemish origins John Van Halen, later Lieutenant General, who had conquered Lérida and Mequinenza by the same way. Industry and communications The industrial tradition of Monzón began early in the 20th century with the construction of a sugar factory which later was moved to Jerez de la Frontera. After the Spanish Civil War, some new industries were incorporated such Hidro Nitro Spanish (HNE), Aiscondel, Etino-Química Polidux, Monsanto-Aiscondel, among others. It also appeared a factory wire, nails and corrugated. This industrialization was possible thanks to the geographical situation of the town, an hour and a half far from the border and Zaragoza as well as by its good communications such as roads linking with Zaragoza and Lleida, the highway (A-22) communicating with Pamplona and the railway line that communicates with Barcelona, northern Spain and Zaragoza and Lleida to connect with the AVE, the high speed train. Culture Conservatory Miguel Fleta The music is represented by Grupo Folclórico de Nuestra Señora de la Alegría, Municipal Band \\"La Lira\\" the Coral Montisonense and the Conservatory of Music \\"Miguel Fleta\\" that have come new groups like Ensemble XXI. Within the panorama of rock, there are large groups such as those of black metal like Ouija, Temple Abattoir and Spellcraft. In other aspects of the culture of Monzón highlight the numerous fairs like the Aragonese book or FLA, retracts and the art fair artery. There are also noteworthy various contests of painting and narrative as well as several cultural concentrations of various kinds and the feast of Saint Barbara martyr in which it is performed the traditional Bautizo del Alcalde (Baptism of the Mayor) and the festivities in honor of Saint Matthew during the week of September 21 and pilgrimage that achieves Easter Monday to the Ermita de la Alegría (Hermitage of the Virgin of the Joy). Sports players and athletes Monzón has been home to sportsmen and women like Conchita Martínez, the first Spanish woman to win Wimbledon, and Eliseo Martín, bronze medal winner in the 3000 m steeplechase in the Paris World Championships (2003) — the only non- African athlete to get a medal in those championships since 1993. Monzón has been home to Olympic athletes, including Javier Moracho (110 m hurdles) — Spanish record holder for almost 20 years — the decathlete Álvaro Burrell, and the renowned pole vaulter Javier Gazol.  Hydrology  River Sosa passing through Monzón Monzón is crossed by the rivers Sosa and Cinca. The latter is the most important because it has higher flow thanks to the amount of snow in its head. In the first one, despite its very little flow, it is remarkable the engineering work in Siphon of the Sosa, a viaduct over the river which flows the Aragon and Catalonia Canal, which was inaugurated in early 20th century by King Alfonso XIII to extend irrigation to the eastern part of the province Monzón is one of the largest agricultural and industrial populations in the region thanks to the Aragon and Catalonia Canal.

This first military road was a beginning of government planning for overland travel, which eventually led Wisconsin, first as a territory and later as a state, and its localities to finance its own system of roadways for various purposes.The Western Upland of Wisconsin, Wisconsin Online, Retrieved July 24, 2007. Remains of the road that exist today are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  Financing and construction  Financed by Congressional action in 1832 and constructed between 1835 and 1837, the first military road in Wisconsin Territory connected three forts. From Fort Howard near Green Bay, the road extended south along the eastern shore of Lake Winnebago and then headed southwest toward Fort Winnebago (near present-day Portage along the Wisconsin River). From Fort Winnebago, the road looped further southwest toward Fort Crawford on the Mississippi River (near present-day Prairie du Chien). The road was underwater at times during wet seasons, and foot-high stumps in the road complicated travel. The 1973 work The History of Wisconsin described the road as \\"little more than a lane through the timber and a pathway over the prairie, with streams bridged and swamps ditched, the road was crude and often impassable; but it nevertheless filled the important objective of traversing Wisconsin from east to west\\". Maintenance by settlers attracted to the area kept the road passable. The cost for initial construction and maintenance for the road was $12,000.  Remains of the road  The Military Road marker in Fond du Lac. Its modern descendant follows the route from Green Bay to Fond du Lac along Wisconsin Highway 55 and U.S. Highway 151, then west on Wisconsin State Highways 68 and 33 to Madison, where it travels west via U.S. Highway 18. The name survives as one for local streets paralleling the current highways. Military Ridge State Trail runs over a portion of its alignment. An actual segment of the road in its original state is also preserved in Fond du Lac County, It is located on farmland purchased by Albert and Martha Raube in 1911; Raube Road was listed in National Register of Historic Places in 1992. Other present-day reminders of the road's legacy include Military Avenue in Green Bay and Military Road in Fond du Lac.

The film's storyline involves the 17th-century Caribbean city of Port Royal in mid-20th century. Plot The sunken Caribbean city of Port Royal had been long rumored to have been visited by pirates who rise from the ocean floor. In the mid 1600s, the port was a thriving seaport, but it was heavily damaged in 1692 and by an earthquake and had suffered numerous hurricanes which had prevented the port from regaining its former glory. A 1907 earthquake caused the city to sink beneath the waves. A scientist (Tony) believes that the older portions of the city will soon become visible due to predicted volcanic activity, and after obtaining grant funding, wants to investigate. Before arriving on the island, thugs local to the area plan to steal all the gold when Port Royal becomes visible. They attack Tony, leaving him hospitalized and steal his research material in their quest to find the rumored pirate's gold. Tony escapes the hospital, and arranges passage to the island. He is forced to take Joan with him, and she is disgruntled having been forced to accompany an exhibition whose theory she finds unlikely. The ruins are now visible as predicted and the criminals obtain the treasure. The two groups happen to meet and are suddenly attacked by giant crabs. Volcanoes begin to erupt as the two groups fight for the treasure and to escape the now sinking city. Production Pollexfen and Wisberg had already made Captive Women and Sword of Venus for RKO. Port Sinister was filmed at the RKO studios with location work at Palos Verdes California. Third and final film made by American Pictures Company by these producers.RKO Radio Pictures Horror, Science Fiction and Fantasy Films, 1929-1956 By Michael R. Pitts. The movie had the working titles of Port Royal-Ghost City Beneath the Sea, Sunken City and City Beneath the Sea. It was based on the real city of Port Royal. Reception Variety found the film to be a very mediocre melodrama. In the book RKO Radio Pictures, the movie was found to have dark filming, the lead acting insufficient and the movie otherwise boring, but it did find the villains of the movie of interest. RKO Radio Pictures Horror, Science Fiction and Fantasy Films, 1929-1956 By Michael R. Pitts Leonard Maltin gave the movie two of four stars, liking the premise of the movie, but finding the acting and the crab effects lacking. http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/86956/Port-Sinister/ References Bibliography * Warren, Bill.

The lock was first built by the Thames Navigation Commissioners in 1773. There are several weirs between the islands but the main weir is upstream between the topmost island and the Buckinghamshire bank. The weir is popular with kayakers whenever conditions are favourable, and it is very busy at weekends. History There was a Flash lock in the weir here, referred to in the 16th and 17th century as \\"New Lock\\". The pound lock was opened in 1773, being the fifth downstream of the eight original locks built after the 1770 navigation act. It was constructed of fir wood, and like the other locks, where the fir was subsequently replaced by oak, it was in decay and in need of repair in 1780 and 1785. On the latter occasion the owner of the flash lock was instructed to keep the flash lock in good repair for use by barges. Further repair was made in 1791, and in 1910 it still had timber sides.Fred. S. Thacker The Thames Highway: Volume II Locks and Weirs 1920 – republished 1968 David & Charles It has since been replaced by masonry. The timber weir winch, looking like a capstan and which was used to pull boats through the Flash Lock, is still at the lock. Access to the lock The lock and weir are easily reached by a short footpath from the free car park, which is at the end of Hurley High Street in the village of Hurley on the south bank of the river. Reach above the lock Lock cut above the lock A short way upstream on the Buckinghamshire bank is Medmenham Abbey home of the notorious Hell Fire Club. The river winds through open country with the paired Frog Mill Ait and Black Boy Island on a sharp bend in the river. Magpie Island is close to Culham Court on the way to Hambleden and Hambleden Lock. Thames Path The Thames Path remains on the Berkshire side and deviates away from the river to the village of Aston, Berkshire, before returning and continuing to Hambledon Lock. Kayaking Playboating at Hurley Weir on 2 gates Hurley is an active freestyle kayaking centre because of the favourable size and shape of the wave. The gates – those which are open – generate a standing wave. Hurley also hosts an annual rodeo competition, the Hurley Classic. Access Two paths, one on either side of the car park, lead to the river and kayakers can put-in on a flat stretch immediately as they arrive at the river, from the car park side. To reach the wave they must paddle upstream (left) and the weir will appear on the right. The first weir should be ignored, as it is un-runnable. Hurley Weir's steps can be run, but will wear the hull of a kayak, and so is advisable to get out at the island where the weir steps, start and put in at the shingle \\"beach\\" below. Gates Hurley weir with all 4 gates open Hurley weir on 4 gates. Looking Downstream Hurley Lock head gates Hurley Lock with the tail gates open The four main weir gates are opened and closed to control the river levels. The number of opened gates will also determine the nature of the wave/waves, and the suitability/difficulty level for kayakers: * 1 Gate – Medium-sized wave, normally on weir river right. Best for longer, faster boats. * 2 Gates – Big wave accompanied by a large hole. * 3 Gates – Optimum level. When the 3 gates opened on river left, classic conditions apply: a big central wave with two holes either side. Doesn't normally stay on 3 for long, and during peak periods there can be queues of 40 or more people. * 4 Gates – A powerful set of linked holes. The farthest hole away from the eddy sometimes referred to as \\"The Dark Side\\", as it is the farthest away from the only eddy. Still relatively safe, but retentive at certain levels. Capsizing results in a flush the vast majority of the time. Note: at certain levels, the wave train often \\"goes left\\" and turns the eddy in a large spinning mass. This has the effect of constantly pushing people who are queuing in the eddy into the main current. Water levels Usually more rainfall means more gates will be open, but this also depends upon the levels at weirs upstream, and as such it can be difficult to predict. For the weir to form a good wave for kayakers, it generally needs to be late autumn, winter or early spring. Hurley is known to work during the summer, but for short periods of time. 9 months is the average consistent period of use. During the winter, a vague rule of thumb is 10 mm of rain is needed to open a gate. In the summer 15 mm may be required, and persistent rain is needed to keep levels up, due to ground levels of water being lower.

It is located just upstream of Streatley on the same side of the river. The village of Cleeve is on the opposite bank near Goring . The first lock was built in 1787 by the Thames Navigation Commissioners. The lock has the smallest fall on the river at 2 ft 3 inches (0.69 m). The reach above it is the longest and the reach below it is the shortest on the non-tidal river. The weir runs to an island below the lock, and there are further weirs between islands downstream. Access to the lock The lock can be reached on foot from Streatley, or by a track which comes off the A329 road to Wallingford. History There was a flash lock recorded on the site in the 16th century. The first pound lock was built of oak in 1787 alongside a meadow which was then known as Winch Meadow. It was originally to be called Streatley Lock, but in the event took its name from the village of Cleeve on the opposite side of the river. Until 1869 Cleeve Lock and Goring Lock were usually operated a single keeper. The lock was rebuilt in 1874.Fred. S.

Much of it is open country apart from the small village of Moulsford and the larger town of Wallingford. There were formerly two ferries along the reach at Little Stoke and at Chalmore Hole near Wallingford because the towpath changed sides. Brunel's Moulsford Railway Bridge crosses at some islands near Moulsford, where there was formerly another flash lock. Winterbrook Bridge a new road bridge crosses just downstream of Wallingford, relieving traffic on the ancient multi-arched Wallingford Bridge. There were formerly two historic and interesting public houses along the river, but these have both been turned into expensive restaurants.Paul Goldsack River Thames: In the footsteps of the famous Englis Heritage/Bradt 2003 The river is an active rowing location with the Oxford University Boat Club and Oxford Brookes University boat club both having club houses on the reach near Wallingford, where Wallingford Rowing Club is also based. The Wallingford Long Distance Sculls take place on the reach in October. The Thames Path keeps on the western bank all the way, but to compensate for those situations when the towpath changed sides it goes inland at Moulsford following the main road for quite a distance before returning to the river. There is also very small diversion away from the river in Wallingford and then the path stays on the western bank to Benson Lock where it crosses over to the other side of the river. The path is paralleled on the other side of the river as far as Winterbrook Bridge by the Ridgeway. Literature and the Media In Jerome K. Jerome's Three Men in a Boat, the narrator recounts a tale of a long and anxious journey down to Cleeve Lock, caused because he had an out of date map showing an intermediate lock at Wallingford. This has a historical basis in fact. Chalmore Lock at Chalmore Hole was established in 1838 (near the current site of the Oxford University Boat Club building), being called a \\"summer or low-water lock and weir\\". Although it appears to have been in decline by 1873 the inhabitants of Wallingford petitioned for its retention. It was removed in 1883 after a damning report from Sir John Hawkshaw.

It lies on the Czarna Staszowska river, in the historic province of Lesser Poland, approximately north-west of Staszów and south-east of the regional capital Kielce. The village's history dates back to the 13th century. It had city rights from before 1400 to 1870. It has several tourist attractions, including a 14th-century palace, open for visitors, with a bison farm nearby, and a 15th-century church. The village has a population of 767. Some time in the mid 14th century, local knight Dobiesław of Kurozwęki built here a castle, which became the seat of the Kurozwęcki noble family (see szlachta). At first the castle was of defensive character, but in the course of the time it was remodeled several times. It is not known when exactly Kurozwęki received town charter, most probably it happened before the year 1400. The town belonged to several families – the Kurozwęcki, the Lanckoroński, the Potocki and the Popiel. In the 17th century, when Kurozwęki belonged to Lesser Poland's Sandomierz Voivodeship, it was one of the centers of Protestant Reformation, especially Calvinism. In 1870, the government of Russian-controlled Congress Poland (see Partitions of Poland) deprived it of the town charter.  Demography  According to the 2002 Poland census, there were 844 people residing in Kurozwęki village, of whom 44.5% were male and 55.5% were female. In the village, the population was spread out, with 15.9% under the age of 18, 28.6% from 18 to 44, 24.4% from 45 to 64, and 31.2% who were 65 years of age or older. > {  style=\\"font-size:85%; text-align:center\\" + > left\\" Table 1.

It is on a lock cut to the north of the main stream, which approaches the large village of Sutton Courtenay. The lock was built of stone by the Thames Navigation Commission in 1809. The associated weirs are on the old course of the river under the massive causeway which separates the millstream from picturesque Sutton Pools. The causeway is very old and was thought to have been built by Saxon labour. History The river originally passed close to Sutton Courtenay and under a large mill there. In 1667 occurs the first reference to a pound lock underneath this mill. This had a set of gates beneath the mill floor and included a wide pool at the back of the mill. Consequently, it required a very large volume of water to fill it and so incurred a heavy toll. There were complaints to the Thames Navigation Commission in 1772 that the floor of the mill was a great obstruction to navigation. Although it was privately owned, the Commission undertook some improvements in 1789, but complaints persisted on the grounds of inconvenience and high tolls.Fred. S. Thacker The Thames Highway: Volume II Locks and Weirs 1920 - republished 1968 David & Charles In 1803, Zachary Allnutt of Henley was appointed as Surveyor to the second and third districts of the Thames, which stretched from Mapledurham to Staines. He replaced John Clarke, who died that year, and was the son of Henry Allnutt, who was clerk to the Thames Commission from 1771 to 1820. Before his appointment, he had carried out a number of surveys for the Commission, including one for a new lock at Culham in 1802, but the scale of the works were larger than any previously undertaken, and the plan was not implemented immediately. However, he made a further survey in 1809, and work began in June, on the longest cut ever made on the Thames. It was long, with a lock at the lower end, constructed with stone walls, and with a relatively large drop for the time of . A stone bridge with a span of was built to carry a road across the cut, and the work took just over a year to complete. The total cost of the project was just under £9,000, which included the purchase of the land. The project was overseen by George Treacher, who was awarded £100 in recognition of his services, when it was completed. Part of the older towpath around the backwater fell into disuse after the lock was built.  Access to the lock  The lock can be reached from the road at Sutton Bridge, Oxfordshire or on foot across the fields from Sutton Courtenay.  Reach above the lock  The navigation follows the lock cut upstream, at the end of the cut is the main river weirstream past Sutton Pools, then the river turns sharply to the right. A new junction for the Wilts & Berks Canal has been constructed almost opposite the top end of Culham Cut as part of a restoration project. The junction was opened on 30 August 2006, and initially runs for about 150 yd (137m) to a winding hole, but will eventually link to the historic route of the canal to the west of Abingdon.Grand Opening of Jubilee Junction Abingdon riverside from the other side of the river About halfway along the river on the eastern bank the Swift Ditch rejoins the main stream. This backwater was formerly the main course of the river and is crossed by a footbridge and the ancient Culham Bridge. The Swift Ditch creates Andersey Island, one of the largest islands on the Thames. On the Thames side there is an attractive piece of parkland before Abingdon Bridge. On the opposite side here is the town of Abingdon. After the bricked-up former entrance to the Wilts & Berks Canal there is an iron bridge over the mouth of the River Ock and then the town quayside. The river is crossed by Abingdon Bridge which is divided into two (the part across the main navigation being Burford Bridge) by Nag's Head Island. Beyond this on the Abingdon side is parkland associated with Abingdon Abbey. There is a rowing club on the reach which is the site of the Abingdon Head race. The Thames Path follows the eastern bank over Culham Bridge and Andersey Island to Abingdon Lock, where it crosses over to the other side.

History Walkway across Abingdon Weir. The navigation route in the vicinity of Abingdon has been subject to change over the centuries. The Swift Ditch further to the east was the original course of the river Thames. The stream to the town was developed by the monks of Abingdon Abbey and the original weir is reputed to have been built by them during the 10th century. A pound lock was built on the Swift Ditch by the Oxford-Burcot Commission in 1635 making it then the navigation route. In 1788 several citizens of Abingdon wanted to divert navigation back to the current course, possibly taking into account the Wilts & Berks Canal which was to connect to the current navigation channel at Abingdon within ten years. As a result, Abingdon Lock was built near the town and opened at the end of 1790. The lock-keeper's house was reported in 1811 to be half a mile downstream of the lock - probably at the abbey millhouse.Fred. S. Thacker The Thames Highway: Volume II Locks and Weirs 1920 - republished 1968 David & Charles Access to the lock The lock can be reached on a track heading north from Abingdon Bridge on the Andersey Island side. Alternatively it is possible to walk along the river from the town centre through Abbey Meadows and cross the weir. Reach above the lock Nuneham House from the river Immediately above the weir towards the town is the channel cut by the monks of Abingdon Abbey in the 10th century to provide navigation and mill water to the abbey itself. For the first few hundred yards the river has turned back on itself making the northern bank temporarily on the southern side. On this side of the lock is Andersey Island created by Swift Ditch. The first outflow is the site of the old lock, and the second channel is the original weir stream. Further upstream the Nuneham Railway Bridge (known as Black Bridge) carried the railway line to Oxford. Upstream of this the river turns northwards at the heavily wooded Lock Wood Island on the eastern bank with the old Radley Boathouse on the opposite side. Beyond the island the river is flanked by Nuneham Park, belonging to Nuneham House with the Jacobean Carfax Water Tower on a hill in the grounds ahead of the Palladian house itself. On the western side the terrain is open farmland with the town of Radley beyond. Near here and on that side on the river is the Radley College boathouse. On the opposite side, meadows for grazing cattle stretch up to Sandford Lock. The Thames Path, which crosses the river at the lock, follows the western bank all the way to Sandford Lock.

The first pound lock was built in 1631 by the Oxford-Burcot Commission although this has since been rebuilt. The lock has the deepest fall of all locks on the Thames at 8ft 9in (2.69m) and is connected to a large island which is one of three at this point. The lock lies at the end of Church Lane in Sandford on Thames. Upstream from the lock, the main weir connects the second island to the opposite bank on the Kennington, Oxfordshire side. This is the location of the infamous Sandford Lasher, a treacherous weirpool where many have drowned. Another weir links the two lower islands. History There was a mill here built by the Knights Templar in around 1294. There are also records of a ferry and a fish weir in mediaeval times. In the reign of Edward III there is an account of the immemorial conflict between millers and bargemen when \\"the men of Oxon broke down the locks of Sandford\\". This was probably at the navigation weir or flash lock on the old river channel behind the second island. This was described in 1624 as ‘Great Lockes’. It was replaced in 1631 when the Oxford-Burcot Commission built one of the first pound locks in England here. The lock was passed on to the Thames Navigation Commission in 1790 and lengthened in 1795, under the direction of Daniel Harris, the Oxford gaoler, at a cost of nearly £1,800. In 1836 a new lock was built on the current site alongside the old one and a lock house was ordered in 1839. The old lock has since been filled in after an incident when a miller opened the sluices and caused damage to the embankments. Its position is still visible (the position of the upper gates can be seen in the stonework above the present upper gates). An iron bridge above the lock was built between 1866 and 1877.Fred. S. Thacker The Thames Highway: Volume II Locks and Weirs 1920 - republished 1968 David & Charles The latest rebuild of the lock was in 1972. Sandford Lasher A newspaper report of the 1921 drowning incident Sandford Lasher, or weir, is on the left bank well upstream of Sandford Lock. The pool below the weir has been notorious since the 19th century because of the number of individuals who have drowned there. Weirs, like the one at Sandford Lasher, generate powerful currents that can trap and hold a victim (and often attempted rescuers) underwater at the base of the structure; hence their reputation as \\"drowning machines\\". Henry Fawcett, a student of University College, Oxford, drowned while swimming in May 1833.Jackson's Oxford Journal  date=25 May 1833  https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/search/results/1833-05-25 John Richardson Currer, brother of Charles Savile Roundell and student of Balliol College, Oxford drowned in February 1840 while attempting to row a skiff through the lasher pool.Jackson's Oxford Journal  date=8 February 1840  issue=4528 https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/search/results/1840-02-08 A 16-year-old pupil of the Cowley Diocesan School, Edward John Templar, the son of the Vicar of Great Coxwell, drowned on 21 May 1864 after diving into the water and saving the life of another boy, a non-swimmer who had accidentally fallen into the weirpool. Clarence Sinclair Collier, a 19-year- old student of Balliol College, drowned in June 1879. He and another student were boating above the weir, but the boat overturned and both they and the boat were carried by the current over the weir and into the lasher pool, where Collier drowned. He is commemorated by a memorial on the wall of the antechapel at Baliol College. At the weir, a 19th-century obelisk records the deaths of five Christ Church students who drowned here - Richard Phillimore and William Gaisford in 1843; George Dasent in 1872 and Michael Llewelyn Davies and Rupert Buxton in 1921. William Gaisford was the son of Thomas Gaisford, the dean of Christ Church. He got into difficulties while swimming on 23 June 1843. His friend, Richard Phillimore, entered the water to save him, but both young men drowned. Richard Phillimore was the son of Dr Joseph Phillimore, the Regius Professor of Civil Law. They are buried in Christ Church Cathedral and also commemorated by two memorial tablets in the north walk of the Cathedral cloisters. Michael Llewelyn Davies was the foster son of writer J. M. Barrie, and one of the main inspirations for the character of Peter Pan. He and Rupert Buxton, the son of Sir Thomas Buxton, 4th Baronet, both drowned on 19 May 1921 in the Sandford LasherPaul Goldsack River Thames: In the Footsteps of the Famous 2003 English Heritage/Bradt in reportedly calm water. Buxton had recently celebrated his 21st birthday and Llewelyn Davies was just short of his 21st birthday. The Sandford Lasher Weir is being used again to generate hydroelectric power (see below) making the memorial obelisk inaccessible. It may be viewed from various points around Sanford Pool, easily accessible from the Kennington side of the River Thames.

On the west bank is the town of Kennington, Oxfordshire. Further upstream are Kennington Railway Bridge where the Hinksey Stream joins the Thames again and Isis Bridge carrying the Oxford southern by-pass. The Thames Path follows the western bank to Iffley Lock crossing the Hinksey Stream on the Kennington Towpath bridge. Hydroelectric power Construction of a hydroelectric power scheme began here in 2011, with the three Archimedes screws being operational from 2018. Literature and the media Sandford Lasher and its dangers are described in chapter 18 of Jerome K Jerome's Three Men in a Boat (1889). > The pool under Sandford lasher, just behind the lock, is a very good place > to drown yourself in. The undercurrent is terribly strong, and if you once > get down into it you are all right. An obelisk marks the spot where two men > have already been drowned, while bathing there; and the steps of the obelisk > are generally used as a diving-board by young men now who wish to see if the > place really IS dangerous. Jerome was a close personal friend of J.M. Barrie, and so probably knew Michael Llewelyn Davies. It is also mentioned in The Dictionary of the Thames by Charles Dickens, Jr.. > It is notorious to all rowing men and habitue's of the river that Sandford > Lasher has almost yearly demanded its tale of victims and it is almost > inconceivable that people will continue year after year to tempt fate in > this and other equally dangerous places In Tom Brown at Oxford, by Thomas Hughes, first published in 1861, the eponymous, principal character has a narrow escape after accidentally rowing a skiff over the weir and into the lasher. Sandford Lock is briefly mentioned in The Four Feathers by A.E.W. Mason (1902). It is also briefly mentioned in the poem The Burden of Itys by Oscar Wilde.

The band consists of John Thomas (drums and percussion), Clyde Rozario (bass guitar), Niranj Suresh (vocals) and Anubhav Langthasa (guitars). They have released a total of two studio albums, and five singles. Since their formation, genres like progressive rock and Carnatic music have influenced their music.  History   Formation and early days  Motherjane was formed in 1996 by drummer John Thomas, guitarist Mithun Raju and bassist Clyde Rozario to \\"fill in\\" for another band which had backed out from a college festival at St. Albert's College, Kochi. The initial line up consisted of John Thomas (drums), Clyde Rozario (bass), Mithun Raju (guitars) and Laji and Nirmal (vocals). Vocalist Laji soon left the band and Motherjane had to continue as an instrumental band without a vocalist. In 1999 lead guitarist Mithun Raju left the band and was replaced by Baiju Dharmajan. Around that time, Motherjane used to jam at a restaurant called Ancient Mariner at Marine Drive, Kochi. In 2000, Suraj Mani an HVAC engineer by training, who used to perform with Bangalore based rock bands, shifted to Kochi and chanced to meet the band at the Ancient Mariner. John invited Mani to sing with the band, but he was not satisfied with the band only doing covers and not writing original material. Mani became the band's vocalist and wrote Motherjane's first original song \\"Disillusioned\\" soon after. About the same time, Motherjane recruited yet another guitarist, Rex Vijayan. Things took a slight detour after six months, when Mani moved back to Bangalore, but they continued to meet and jam as a band.  Insane Biography (2002–2003)  Motherjane released their debut album, Insane Biography in 2002 under Kan & Will Records. The songs \\"Maya\\" and \\"Soul Corporations\\" had strong Indian musical elements which would continue in later albums. \\"Soul Corporations\\" was featured in Geki-Teki Metal, a compilation album released in Japan in 2004. Soon after the release of Insane Biography, Rex Vijayan left the band in 2003, and was replaced by Deepu Sasidharan. Sasidharan, at that time, was playing with the Kochi-based hard rock band 13AD. Insane Biography was the only Indian album to be featured in the Asian Rock Rising Festival in Japan on 1 November 2003. The band also headlined Levi's Great Indian Rock 2003.  Maktub (2008–present)  Maktub which was released in 2008, marked a change in Motherjane's musical style. Influence of Carnatic music was prominently seen in the guitar, vocals and percussion, and native instruments like the chenda were used. In 2009, Rolling Stone India named Maktub as the album of the year. In 2008, Motherjane opened for Megadeth and Machine Head in Rock in India 2008, Bangalore and for Opeth in Saarang '08 at IIT Madras. Motherjane has been a frequent headliner of college rock festivals across India. Motherjane was ranked No. 1 in Rock Street Journal's bands of the decade in 2010. In the 2010 AVIMA Awards, Motherjane won the award for the Most Popular Act of Asia, and lead vocalist Suraj Mani was awarded Best Rock Vocalist. In the 2009 AVIMA Awards, Motherjane was awarded the Best Rock Act. They has done an OST titled 'Jihad' for the movie 'Anwar' by Amal Neerad in 2010. In November 2010, Motherjane on their website announced guitarist Baiju Dharmajan's departure from the band to work with his new band Wrenz United. In January 2011 Motherjane announced that Santhosh Chandran has joined the band as the band's new guitarist. In the same year, Motherjane performed at Autumn Muse, the annual cultural festival of St. John's Medical College, Bangalore.http://nh7.in/indiecision/2011/08/30/pics- atfc-motherjane-pentagram-st-johns-college-bangalore/ Motherjane's vocalist left the band in November 2011 citing health problems. He was replaced by Vivek Thomas who joined Motherjane in December 2011. Santhosh was replaced in 2013 by Nithin Vijayanath. Towards the end of 2012 the band started work on a new single 'Clayplay' with Rex Vijayan as producer with a vision to revamp the sound of the band. Clay play was eventually released on January 10, 2015 and marked a drastic shift in the musical direction of Motherjane. The single 'Namaste' released in May 2018 is to be seen as a follow up to the change in musical style, again produced by Rex Vijayan. It hit #1 on the Apple Music rock charts in India within the 1st week of release. In June 2018 Motherjane announced on their Facebook page that they have recruited a new guitar player, Anubhav Langthasa, through auditions.

The first lock was built of stone by Daniel Harris for the Thames Navigation Commission in 1790.Davies & Robinson, 2003, pages 76-77 Across the weir pool is a large Environment Agency complex which monitors the River Thames, while a small office building exists on the front lawn opposite from the lock house. The weir is upstream of the lock alongside the navigation channel in two parts and feeds the Osney pool. To the south and southwest are Osney Mill Marina and Osney Cemetery. Oxford railway station on the Botley Road is close by to the northwest. History The main navigation channel was formerly on the branch of the river known as Bulstake Stream further west. The present stream was developed in mediaeval times by the monks of Osney Abbey on the west side of the island then known as Osney, to serve as a millstream for Osney Mill, in a manner similar to that at Abingdon. There was an ancient weir, the property of the Abbey on the site, and a pound lock was first considered in 1787. The stream became the main navigation channel when the lock was built in 1790. Daniel Harris used prisoner labour from Oxford jail to give the cheapest quote for the work.Thacker, 1920/1968, page 114-116 The last rebuilding of the lock was in 1905. Access to the lock The lock can be reached a short way down the towpath from Osney Bridge on the A420 Botley Road on the way west out of the centre of Oxford. Reach above the lock The river passes a former electricity generating station and is crossed by Osney Bridge near Oxford railway station. On the eastern bank are built up parts of Oxford. After a stretch of allotments on the western bank and the backs of houses on the eastern bank there is the curious water crossroads - \\"Four Rivers\\". This provides a link to the Oxford Canal via the Sheepwash Channel in one direction and there is Bulstake Stream in the other direction. The river runs through willow banks until it reaches Fiddler's Island. There used to be a weir and flash lock here; now there is the rainbow shaped Medley Footbridge crossing the main channel. On the other side of the island is Castle Mill Stream, an old navigation channel that runs to the east closer to the centre of Oxford rejoining the Thames below the lock. On the eastern bank is the open ground of Port Meadow as far as Wolvercote. There are navigation transit markers alongside Port Meadow upstream of Medley Boat station, to allow river users to check their speed. A powered boat should not pass between the markers in under one minute.

The main weir is a short way upstream but there is another weir at Godstow Bridge just above the Trout Inn. These feed into a backwater (Wolvercote Mill Stream) which has come from above King's Lock by Wolvercote. History Prior to the construction of the lock, Godstow Bridge served as a form of lock, which remained in service for some time after the construction of Godstow Lock in 1790. After the lock was constructed there were complaints about the raising of the water levels and the effect this had on the meadows upstream at Pixey Mead. After some years of dilapidation, the lock underwent major repair in 1872. River users would often avoid the lock by navigating up the stream past Wolvecote. The lock house was built around 1896 on condition that it sold no refreshments to protect the interests of The Trout Inn. Previously the lock- keeper had lived on a houseboat.Thacker, 1920/1968, page 101-103 The lock was last rebuilt in 1924.

It is in the centre of a triangle formed by the small villages of Shifford, Duxford and Chimney in Oxfordshire. It is at the start of a navigation cut built with the lock by the Thames Conservancy in 1898. This was the only new lock built on the non-tidal Thames in the era of falling revenue after the Thames Conservancy took over responsibilities of the Thames Navigation Commission. It replaced a flash lock in a weir about 3/4 mile downstream. There is a small weir beside the lock and a larger weir on the old course of the river upstream at the top of the lock cut. History The original flash lock was in a weir close to the entrance to Great Brook. This was removed between 1829 and 1853, and there were later complaints about the lack of draught in the river. Discussion of the possibility of the new lock only began in 1896 and two years later it was open. The lock cut was based on a pre-existing side channel which was considerably widened. After the lock was built, the towpath around the old navigation channel fell into disuse. There were moves to have it called Chimney Lock, but the name Shifford Lock was adopted.Fred. S.

History There was originally a weir and flash lock about a mile upstream called Old Nan's Weir. A survey made in 1790 concluded that the site was unsuitable for a pound lock, and it was built at Rushey instead. There is no record of an earlier weir or lock at Rushey. Keepers at Rushey had oversight of Old Nan's Weir which was finally removed in 1868. Rushey lock was reported as in a bad state of deterioration in 1857 and the weir also in 1871, repairs being needed on both occasions.

The lock was built of stone by the Thames Navigation Commission in 1790 and is the smallest on the River Thames. Like most of the Upper Thames Locks, it still has its heavy wooden beams which the lock keeper uses to open and close the gates. The new weir was created in 1979 when a cut was made through fields on the southern side of the lock. Of an unusual cresting design, it is now a National Trust picnic area. The weir was previously on the northern side of the lock. The area is rich in flora and fauna, and a frequent haunt for otters, kites and kingfishers. History Before the construction of the lock, a flash lock was in place at Buscot weir to help navigation. When the lock was built the weir was owned by Edward Loveden Loveden of Buscot Park, who was a very strong champion of Thames navigation. The pound lock was built by J. Nock who also built St John's Lock at the same time after the opening of the Thames and Severn Canal.Fred. S. Thacker The Thames Highway: Volume II Locks and Weirs 1920 - republished 1968 David & Charles At first it was often alluded to as the \\"New Lock\\".

It is currently threatened by habitat loss. Taxonomy and systematics The alternate name of singing bush lark usually refers to the species of that name, Mirafra cantillans. Other alternate names for the melodious lark include: Latakoo lark, Latakoo bush lark, melodious bushlark, singing bush lark, Southern lark, Southern singing bush lark and Southern singing lark.  Distribution and habitat  The melodious lark has a probable maximum range of , separated into many disjunct populations located in South Africa (Eastern Cape, the Free State, Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal, Limpopo, and North West Province), Botswana and Zimbabwe. At times, local populations will abandon one area for another when the regular dry-season fires occur.  Habitat  The natural habitat of the melodious lark is subtropical or tropical, seasonally wet or flooded, lowland grassland. Within these regions, it prefers the drier slopes, especially in open runs between grassy tussocks. Melodious larks select different textures of grass or grass parts to build their domed, obliquely-accessed nests. They use the harder and more fibrous grasses and stalks for an outer thatch, while the finer and softer grasses or grass leaves are used to line the nest's interior.  Behaviour and ecology   Breeding  The melodious lark is assessed as likely to be both territorial and monogamous, and lays a clutch of 2-4 eggs. It is generally resident, breeding from September to March. The level of breeding activity varies depending on locality. The most active period in South Africa is between November and January, while in Zimbabwe it is from January to March.  Food and feeding  The melodious lark forages on the ground for food, eating mostly grass seeds supplemented with insects.

Behaviour and ecology  It is generally found singly or in pairs foraging on the ground for insects and seeds. When disturbed it flies to a safe, elevated position on the branch of a tree or on the top of a bush.

Taxonomy and systematics  Formerly, some authorities considered Friedmann's lark to be a subspecies of the singing bush lark. Alternate names for the species include Friedmann's bush lark, rufous lark and Sagon lark.  Description  It is best identified by its distinctive song; a long, drawn-out singular note, hoo-ee-oo (with slight stress on the ee), repeated at 1 or 2 second intervals. It is heard more often at night, and given while atop a bush or during undulating display flights. Distribution and habitat Friedmann's lark is found in southern Ethiopia, central and south-eastern Kenya, and north-eastern Tanzania, but its population and exact range are very poorly known.Phil Benstead, et al.; Friedmann's Lark - BirdLife Species Factsheet The type specimen was collected in Ethiopia (from the Konso-Sagan area) in 1992, having been seen only one time since, in 1998; but most of what is known comes primarily from data collected in Tsavo East and West National Parks, in Kenya. There are also a few records from Tanzania, from Mkomazi Game Reserve, south of Arusha. In general, the natural habitats of Friedmann's lark are subtropical or tropical dry lowland grasslands. Being aloof and shy, it apparently chooses the moister (or less dry), ranker-growing of these areas, and where it can find it, those with more bush-cover. This is in contrast to the more dry, and more open environs preferred by many other species of lark. Behaviour and ecology It is nearly always witnessed only during certain times of year (in Tanzania, during rainy season, for example), to the exclusion of other times; and often amongst other migrant species. These observations would seem to suggest that it is a migratory bird, but more corroborating data is needed to make a definitive determination. Friedmann's lark appears to subsist mainly on small beetles, grasshoppers and other insects, as well as grass seeds.

Samuel Ampzing (24 June 1590 - 29 July 1632) was a Dutch minister, poet and purist. Biography Born to the minister Johannes Ampzing in Haarlem, in 1616 Samuel became a minister himself at Rijsoord in Strevelshoek, and in 1619 at the Sint-Bavokerk in Haarlem. Description and praise of Haarlem In 1617, he began writing a description of Haarlem in poetic form, aided by Petrus Scriverius. Its poetry was printed and published in 1628. This history of the city was not superseded until Pieter Langendijk's nearly a century later. As a foreword to this book, Ampzing wrote a dissertation on the Dutch language, in which he also wrote about the rules of rhetoric; this foreword was also sold separately in 1628 under the title \\"\\"Taelbericht der Nederlandsche spellinge\\" (\\"Treatise on Dutch spelling\\"). Later he also wrote an extra \\"Laurel Wreath to Laurens Janszoon Koster\\" at the end of it. The book includes some plates by Willem Outgertsz Akersloot after designs by Pieter Saenredam and Jan van de Velde: File:Pieter Saenredam - Berkenrode.jpgPrint of the old castle at Berkenrode, Heemstede. File:Het beleg van Haarlem in 1572 (Pieter Jansz. Saenredam, 1628).jpgPrint of the siege situation sketch at Haarlem in 1572, a bird's eye perspective from the North. Legacy Apart from the historical importance of his writing, his poetry was not considered quite lyrical, but it was striking in its groomed linguistic usage. Ampzing was notably and carefully different from his contemporaries in his choice of words, and fervently opposed to using words from different languages, such as Latin and French, in Dutch texts. He considered the influence of these languages as pernicious, and as polluting the pure Dutch language. One suspects that he was also driven to this point of view since these languages were being used by his 'religious competitors'. Ampzing's lingual struggle was reignited in 1999 by the foundation of the Ampzing Society, whose members fight - like Ampzing - against the superfluous use of English loan-words in the contemporary Dutch language. On 26 November 2006, on the Oude Groenmarkt at Haarlem, they unveiled a bust of Ampzing.

It is the first book in the Conqueror series based on the Mongols of the Asian steppes. It is titled Genghis: Birth of an Empire in the United States. After completing the Emperor series on the life of Julius Caesar, Iggulden began research for his next series of books, based on the life of Mongol warlord Genghis Khan. In the author's note of the book, Iggulden explains he traveled to rural Mongolia during his research. Plot summary The narrative follows the early life of Temujin, the second son of Yesugei, the khan of the Mongolian \\"Wolves\\" tribe. His father is attacked by assassins and soon dies from his injuries. Yesugei's first bondsman, Eeluk, assumes control of the tribe. Fearing the sons of the former khan may contest his leadership when they reach adulthood, Eeluk banishes Temujin's family from the tribe, leaving them to fend for themselves on the harsh Steppes. The expectation was that Temujin's family would perish in the unforgiving winter, but Temujin, along with his mother Hoelun, his four brothers Bekter, Khasar, Kachiun, Temüge, and his baby sister Temulun, survived against all the odds, albeit in poverty. In an argument over food, Temujin kills his older brother Bekter, much to his mother's anguish. After a few years of trading with other wandering families, the family establish a small home. But the Wolf tribe return to the area, and advanced riders, sent by Eeluk to ensure the family had perished, capture Temujin. He is taken back to the tribe where he is tortured, and kept in a pit, in preparation for a ritual murder. He is freed by Arslan and Jelme, father and son wanderers who joined the Wolves after looking for Yesugei, whom Arslan owed a debt. They join Temujin and his family and begin a new tribe, accepting other wandering families into their protection. Temujin assumes the role of khan. Temujin returns to the Olkhunut to claim his wife Borte. Shortly after, Borte is captured by a Tartar raiding party. Temujin and his brothers chase down the captors and murder them, recovering Borte. The small army retaliates with repeated raids on Tartar camps. The Tartars respond by sending armies to crush the new menace. It is then that a Chin emissary approaches Temujin with an offer from Toghrul, Khan of the Kerait. Temujin joins his small fledgling tribe with Toghrul's, and leads a joint army to advance on the Tartars. It is in the following battle that Temujin begins to show outstanding tactical abilities, as the Mongols ease to victory. Upon interrogating a Tartar prisoner, Temujin learns that the leader of the Olkhunut conspired with the Chin to lead the Tartar assassins to his father. He also learns that a massive Tartar army is advancing into Mongol lands. Temujin returns to the Kerait, then travels to the Olkhunut tribe, where he murders the khan in his ger and assumes leadership of the tribe, and takes them back to join the Kerait. The Mongol alliance prepares for battle, when they are joined by the Wolves. Temujin and Eeluk agree to settle their feud upon victory over the Tartars. Under Temujin's faultless leadership and strategy, the Tartar army is crushed. As the battle ends, Temujin and Eeluk fight, with Temujin emerging victorious. He claims leadership of the Wolves and takes the warriors back to the Kerait. Fearing an inevitable challenge to his leadership, Toghrul sends assassins to Temujin's ger. The attempt is unsuccessful, and Toghrul is banished out of the unified tribe. Temujin proclaims himself khan of all Mongol tribes and bestows the name Genghis upon himself. Historical accuracy The source material for the book is The Secret History of the Mongols. As with the Emperor series before it, Iggulden sometimes strays from historical sources for the purpose of storytelling. Some of the differences are described in an author's note at the end of the book. In addition to differences to some names of characters and tribes, some major inaccuracies include: Borte was captured by the Merkit tribe, not the Tartars; and she was held captive for several months, rather than a few weeks; Temujin's childhood enslavement by the Ta'yichiut, also lasting several months, is not described; however, some elements of his escape (being liberated by a sympathetic member of the capturing tribe, but then returning to their home to hide) is incorporated into the fictional account of his capture by the \\"Wolves\\"; Temujin's childhood friend, blood-brother, and major rival Jamuka is excluded from the story; the relationship between Temujin and Toghrul is simplified: it is not mentioned that he and Yesugei were Anda and the omission of the influence Toghrul's son Senggum had on their relationship; and the influence of the Chin emissary is entirely fictional.

Two other species, the rufous-tailed lark and the Cape clapper lark are both also sometimes referred to using the name bar-tailed lark. It is found from Morocco to Pakistan. Its natural habitat is hot deserts. This is in many places a common species, but elsewhere rather less common. It has a very wide distribution and faces no obvious threats, but surveys have shown that it is slowly decreasing in numbers. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\". Taxonomy and systematics The bar-tailed lark was originally placed in the genus Melanocorypha. Alternate names for the bar-tailed lark include: bar- tailed finch-lark, black-tailed desert lark, black-tailed lark, and black- tailed sand lark.  Subspecies  Three subspecies are recognized: * A. c. cinctura - (Gould, 1839): Found on Cape Verde Islands * A. c. arenicolor - (Sundevall, 1850): Originally described as a separate species in the genus Alauda.

Prior to the airing of the remainder of season 1, a compilation of the first 10 episodes titled Season One: Chapter One was released. Following suit, the latter half of season 1 was later compiled as Season 1: Chapter Two.

Disney, 2008.DVD. Buena Vista Entertainment, 2008.  Episodes   Season 1 (2007–08)  The first chapter of Greek opens as incoming freshman, Rusty Cartwright (Jacob Zachar) matriculates at Cyprus-Rhodes University (CRU). Rusty is the science-geek brother to social butterfly of CRU's Greek system, Casey Cartwright (Spencer Grammer). When Rusty decides to rush a fraternity, their social lives collide. Rusty discovers Casey's boyfriend, Evan (Jake McDorman), cheating on Casey with Rebecca Logan (Dilshad Vadsaria), an incoming, freshman pledge. Casey gets even with Evan by sleeping with her ex-boyfriend, Cappie (Scott Michael Foster), the president of the party fraternity, Kappa Tau, which Rusty joins. Throughout the season, Casey works to repair her relationship with Evan, and deal with Rebecca's acrimonious attempt to undermine her leadership at ZBZ. Rusty navigates the balance between being a fraternity brother and honors engineering student, with the help of Casey, Cappie, his roommate Dale (Clark Duke), friend Calvin (Paul James), and his first girlfriend, Jen K (Jessica Rose). Ashleigh (Amber Stevens) befriends Calvin, and unwittingly outs him to Omega Chi. When Jen K writes a story for the school paper exposing Greek secrets, Casey finds herself established as ZBZ's interim president. Rusty breaks-up with Jen K, and Evan breaks-up with Casey due to her ambiguous feelings for Cappie. Chapter two opens the first week of the new semester. The Greeks find themselves under the auspices of new rules and regulations, and Casey finds herself under the watchful eye of Nationals representative, Lizzie (Senta Moses), who brings a higher level of tradition and conservatism to the sisterhood. Cappie and Rebecca begin dating, Evan and Casey learn how to be friends until Evan's jealousy gets in the way, Casey forgives Frannie and lets her back into ZBZ, Rusty mourns the loss of his first relationship, and the rivalry between fraternities splinters his friendship with Calvin. Cappie, Casey, Evan, and Frannie's histories are explored in a flashback episode. Greek traditions are explored throughout chapter two, such as the Mr. Purr- fect competition, the All Greek Ball, and Parents Weekend. All this activity leads up to Spring Break when Rebecca's father's scandalous proclivities hit home, forcing a drunken confrontation with Cappie, an unplanned kiss on the beach between him and Casey, and a reconciliation between Rusty and Calvin.  Season 2 (2008–09)  The third chapter opens during Greek week, Cappie and Casey try to curb Rebecca's rebellious behavior, leading to Cappie and Rebecca's breakup. Evan continues his relationship with Frannie, begun over Spring Break, his competition with Cappie heats up, and he accepts a multimillion-dollar trust fund from his parents, despite their attached strings. Casey begins dating Rusty's RA, Max (Michael Rady), a polymer science grad student, of whom Cappie grows jealous. Frannie begins a bid for a second presidential term, competing with Casey for the title, but unbeknownst to anyone Rebecca and the other pledges vote to elect Ashleigh (Amber Stevens). The chapter ends on Hell Week, when the pledges prove themselves to their houses, Casey and Max face the dilemma of a long distance relationship, and Frannie establishes a new sorority, taking half of ZBZ with her. It's a new year at CRU, when chapter four begins. Casey's fresh off a disappointing internship in DC, but Max turns down Caltech to stay with Casey at CRU, pushing the commitment level beyond her comfort zone. When Max leaves for a month, it gives Casey time to consider their relationship. Frannie's competitive sorority, Iota Kappa Iota challenges ZBZ during rush, forcing the once prestigious sorority to accept less esteemed pledges. Rusty begins dating Jordan, but when facing a failing grade in an important class, he decides that his social life is more important to him at the moment. Cappie and Max's dislike for each other intensifies, but Evan and Cappie begin to rekindle their friendship, when pushed together as part of the Amphora Society, CRU's secret society. Evan turns down his trust fund. Frannie puts Ashleigh in the hot seat with Panhellenic, lying to get her expelled, but in a confrontation with the ZBZ president, Frannie chooses to shut IKI down, realizing it will never be ZBZ, and leaves CRU. Casey is content to commit to Max once he returns, until a near-death experience forces her to realize that she's still in love with Cappie, but Cappie's been used too many times by Casey, and turns her down.  Season 3 (2009–10)  The fifth chapter of Greek continues during the fall semester of last season, while the sixth chapter takes place during the winter semester.  Season 4 (2011)  On February 19, 2010, it was announced that Greek had been renewed for a 10-episode fourth and final season. The first episode of the final season aired January 3, 2011.

It is based on a method that links the results of subjective life-satisfaction surveys to the objective determinants of quality of life across countries along with a forward-looking element. As of 2020, 6 countries from Western Europe, 2 from Oceania, 1 from Asia and 1 from Northern America dominate the top 10, with Switzerland, Australia, Singapore and Canada leading in their respective regions. Methodology The index calculated for 2013 includes data from 80 countries and territories. The survey used ten quality of life factors along with forecasts of future GDP per capita to determine a nation's score. The life satisfaction scores for 2006 (on a scale of 1 to 10) for 130 countries (from the Gallup Poll) are related in a multivariate regression to various factors. As many as 11 indicators are statistically significant. Together these indicators explain some 85% of the inter-country variation in life satisfaction scores. The values of the life satisfaction scores that are predicted by the indicators represent a country's quality of life index. The coefficients in the estimated equation weight automatically the importance of the various factors. The estimated equation for 2006 can be utilized to calculate index values for year in the past and future, allowing for comparison over time as well across countries. The independent variables in the estimating equation for 2006 include: *Material well-being as measured by GDP per capita (in $, at 2006 constant PPPS) *Life expectancy at birth *The quality of family life based primarily on divorce rates *The state of political freedoms *Job security (measured by the unemployment rate) *Climate (measured by two variables: the average deviation of minimum and maximum monthly temperatures from 14 degrees Celsius; and the number of months in the year with less than 30mm rainfall) *Personal physical security ratings (based primarily on recorded homicide rates and ratings for risk from crime and terrorism) *Quality of community life (based on membership in social organisations) *Governance (measured by ratings for corruption) *Gender equality (measured by the share of women holding seats in national Houses of Assembly)  2020 rankings  { class=\\"sortable \\" center\\" - !

It is found across northern Africa from Mauritania through the Middle East to north-western India. Its natural habitat is dry savanna. Taxonomy and systematics The black-crowned sparrow-lark is also known as the black-crowned finch lark, white-crested finch-lark, white-crested sparrow-lark, white-fronted finch-lark and white-fronted sparrow-lark.  Subspecies  Three subspecies are recognized: * E. n. nigriceps - (Gould, 1839): Found on Cape Verde Islands * Saharan black-crowned sparrow-lark (E. n. albifrons) - (Sundevall, 1850): Found from Mauritania and Senegal to Sudan * Eastern black-crowned sparrow-lark (E. n. melanauchen) - (Cabanis, 1851): Found from eastern Sudan to Somalia, Arabia, Socotra Island, southern Iraq, Iran and Pakistan Description The adult males has a bold pied head pattern with a mainly blackhead with contrasting white forehead and white cheek patches. The upperparts are pale greyish brown with black underparts and underwings which contrast with a white patch at the sides of the breast. The tail is blackish with buff edges and grey central feathers, The bill is horn coloured. The females are very different being pale sandy brown on the upperparts with faint streaking on the crown and whitish patches around the eye and on the sides of the neck. The female's underparts are whitish with a pale cinnamon breast band and black underwing coverts, The juveniles are similar to the fameals but the feathers on the head are tipped with buff. The bird is 11.5–12.5 cm in length from bill to tail. The male's song is quite variable, typically consisting of a short series of simple, sweet notes, either sung in the flight display or from a low vantage point in a bush or on a rock. Distribution and habitat The black-crowned sparrow-lark occurs across North Africa, from the Cape Verde archipelago east through the Sahel of northern Africa, through the Arabian Peninsula and into Pakistan and India. The black-crowned sparrow-lark occurs in arid and semi-arid plains with scattered low vegetation and tussocks of grass, preferring sandy areas over areas with rocky soil, it has also been observed around salt pans. Behaviour and ecology In the heat of midday, these birds reduce water loss by staying in the shade, and it has even been recorded sheltering within the burrows of large lizards. It will also attempt to regulate its body temperature by flying with the legs dangling below it to expose the bare skin, or by perching facing into the wind, with the wings drooped to increase its surface area which is exposed to the moving air. Outside of the breeding season, they may form flocks of up to 50 birds which forage together but large flocks of several thousand have been recorded. Breeding The male black-crowned sparrow- lark performs aerial displays over the breeding territory, in which he climbs steeply up from the ground prior to circling and calling, before falling in a series of shallow dives. Sometimes both male and female will display together, the male pursuing the female in a twisting, low flight. They normally breed during the summer months, and breeding is often triggered by rain and so can take place at almost any time when conditions are favourable. The nestis a shallow depression which is lined with plant and other material, with the rim often marked out with small stones or small clods of earth. The nest is usually situated beneath a shrub or a grass tuft so that some shade is provided. Both sexes incubate the clutch of 2 to 3 eggs, for around 11 to 12 days. The chicks start to leave the nest some time before they are able to fly for short periods at around six days old and typically leave it altogether at around eight days old. Soon after the chicks leave the nest, the chicks separate and each adult becomes solely responsible for one chick, this may be behaviour which reduces the risk of predation. If there are more than two chicks the other chicks often do not survive. The chicks fledge properly at around 21 or 22 days old and reach sexual maturity at about a year old. Food and feeding The black-crowned sparrow-lark is a seed eater, but will also feed on insects and other invertebrates. The young are fed predominantly on a diet of insects while in the nest. In such a hot environment the birds do most of their foraging in the early morning and evening. Food is normally found on the ground, although flying insects are sometimes caught by the bird hawking them in the air.

Males attract attention to themselves by their bold and repeated wing-fluttering displays from prominent perches, which is accompanied by a melodious and far- carrying whistled phrase. This rudimentary display has been proposed as the precursor to the wing-clapping displays of other bush lark species. They have consistently rufous outer wings and a short erectile crest, but the remaining plumage hues and markings are individually and geographically variable. It has a straight lower, and longish, curved upper mandible. Taxonomy and systematics The rufous-naped lark is geographically very variable, and is taken to form a species complex with the allopatric red-winged lark of East Africa, and perhaps with the Somali lark. It is a smaller version of the first, with a finer bill and shorter tail, but their morphological and vocal features do not intergrade where their ranges meet. The rufous nape is an equivocal field character, being absent in the tropical races and in some individuals. Due to the inherent variability of the species, some of the 23–25 odd races are perhaps insufficiently distinct or clinal. Consequently, M. a. rostrata and M. a. zuluensis are sometimes merged with M. a. africana, and M. a. okahandjae with M. a. pallida. On the other hand, a few taxa are arguably incipient or full species. The distinctly plumaged blackish lark comprises races M. a. nyikae and M. a. nigrescens, and is altitudinally isolated from M. a. transvaalensis in nearby Tanzania. Malbrant's lark, M. (a.) malbranti, which ranges from Gabon to Angola, has a fairly distinct display flight, but may intergrade with M. a. kabalii in Zambia. Sharpe's lark, M. (a.) sharpii, of northwestern Somalia, has almost plain, coppery red upper parts and is sometimes (e.g., by Sibley and Monroe) regarded as a separate and endangered species. Its small range of some 21,200 km2 is impacted by overgrazing and conversion to croplands. It may however be conspecific with Somali lark, M. (a.) somalica, which differs by its very long bill and white edges to the outer tail feathers. The Somali lark is sometimes considered a race of rufous- naped lark, but is alternatively deemed a full species in Mirafra or Certhilauda.  Subspecies  The nominate race, M. a. subsp. africana, is native to the Eastern Cape, South Africa Blackish lark, M. a. subsp. nyikae, in Kitulo National Park, Tanzania Twenty-three subspecies are recognized: * M. a. henrici Bates, 1930 is found from Guinea to south-western Ivory Coast. * M. a. batesi Bannerman, 1923 was originally described as a separate species.

Description The rufous-naped lark is a fairly large and robust lark species, with rather heavy flight. The sexes are similar, but males average larger and heavier. Adults are individually and geographically variable. It measures 15–18 cm from bill tip to tail tip and weighs 40-44 g. The streaked upper parts, short erectile crest, creamy-buff eyebrow that merges with the lore, and the rufous flight feathers are easily discernible features. The hindcrown and nape are streaked along the feather centers while the margins vary from chestnut, rufous or pinkish buff to greyish brown. The wings appear conspicuously rufous in flight, while the outer edges of the primaries show up as a rufous panel on the closed wing. The underwing coverts are rufous, and upper coverts are broadly edged tawny or buff (or grey in race grisescens). The tail is dark brown, but the outer webs of the outer tail feathers vary from buff (cf. africana and sharpii) to tawny or bright rufous. The mantle is lighter brown than the back, and the rump still darker brown. The flanks are a shade darker than the rufous-buff belly, but regionally the plumage may also be stained red by soil. The throat is unmarked but the pale rufous upper breast is streaked and spotted darker brown. The eyes are hazel brown, the longish bill is blackish and pinkish, and the feet pink to pinkish brown. Juveniles have bold black spotting on the crown, mantle and wing coverts, all edged with buff, while the breast spotting is more blotchy or diffuse. Geographic variation M. a. athi of the Kenyan highlands is typically coloured, but like other tropical races, lacks the rufous nape. Most accepted races are distinguished based on the colour of the back or underpart plumage, or the amount of streaking on the ear coverts and flanks. High altitude races M. a. nyikae and M. a. nigrescens, which occur above 2,000 meters, have very dark upper part plumages and increased flank streaking. M. a. tropicalis which is found above 1,000 meters has a solid rufous wash over the underparts. Of the southern African races, those in the southeast are the largest and darkest (cf. M. a. africana and M. a. rostrata), with a cline towards lightly streaked and pale pinkish plumages in the northwest.  Distribution and habitat  The rufous-naped lark is found in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa. It has a very large but discontinuous range, with an estimated global extent of occurrence of 5,600,000 km2. Its range is believed to be increasingly fragmented in the north, from which a declining population is inferred. The southern African population has not contracted in range or abundance, save for areas of extensive cultivation or urbanization. Livestock ranching is believed to have created bare patches in grasslands, which they favour. The populations of southern Mozambique and Swaziland have been estimated at >50,000 and 100,000 individuals respectively. It tolerates a range of dry or mesic habitats, typically bushy grassland or sparsely wooded savannah. It also occurs along the fringes of marshes, in woodland clearings or in the fragmented ecotone of woodland and grassland. It is present from near sea level in the south, to about 3,000 meters near the equator. In Zimbabwe it occurs from 900 to 1,800 meters, and in East Africa from 1,000 to 3,000 meters. Termitaria, bushes, small trees or fence posts provide perches for display, while a combination of tall and short grass provides cover and foraging space. In southern Africa it occurs only sparsely in grassy fynbos, grassy karoo and upland sour grasslands, but has high reporting rates in the Eastern Highlands of Zimbabwe, in miombo and in sweet or mixed grasslands. Behaviour and ecology The rufous-naped lark is sedentary, territorial and monogamous. It is often sluggish, allowing a close approach. Short distances are covered in low, level or undulating flight, or it may flee an intruder by running and dodging through grass haphazardly. It may be difficult to flush from grass, and is easily overlooked when not singing. At any time of the year, but especially when the rains commence, a male will spend hours calling from a conspicuous perch. A clear, somewhat variable, whistled phrase of three to five syllables is typical, which may be rendered as tseep-tseeoo, teeoo-teewee or chiwiki- chiwi. The song may be changed after each 20 or so repetitions. During some intermissions the wings are audibly fluttered in the few seconds between phrases. This results in a quick prrrrt or phrrrp rattle, and may lift the bird off its perch. The crest is also lifted during display. It may alternatively sing a rudimentary song consisting of whistles, tweets and trills (distinguishable as imitated calls), during short flights over the grass or during an upward spiraling flight, before it planes down. Race malbranti in particular, may sing during a straight and direct display flight and clap its wings above its back. Perched males may also string together fragments of the songs of various grassland birds. It utters peewit, tweekiree or pree, pree notes in alarm. Breeding The male will courtship feed the female to reinforce their pair-bond or to secure a mating opportunity. The nest is a well concealed cup of dry grass that is positioned in a deep scrape at the base of a grass tuft or against a shrub. A flimsy or substantial grass dome (typical of Mirafra and related genera) covers the nest while leaving a front entrance. The cup is lined with finer plant material, and 2 to 3 (rarely 4) eggs are laid. The eggs are white, cream or pink in colour, and speckled brown and grey, especially near the blunter end. The chicks have bright yellow gapes, three black tongue spots, and a spot near the tip of the lower mandible. They are covered in pale grey to buff down, and are brooded by the female only. The incubation period is about 14 to 15 days, and singing by the male decreases as incubation commences. The young are fed by both parents, though mainly by the female. Surviving chicks leave the nest after about 12 days, before they are able to fly. Post-breeding moult has been recorded in mid December in Botswana and from July to August in Kenya. Food and feeding It forages at the bases of grass tufts, on bare ground including cultivated lands and fallow fields, and between ungulate droppings. It may also catch termite alates in the air or as they emerge from termitaria, or glean insects from plants. Food includes insects of various groups, spiders, solifugids, millipedes, earthworms, and in winter some seeds of grasses and forbs. It may forage in burnt grassland immediately after fires.

History The Duke of Newcastle owned mineral rights in much of north Nottinghamshire and north-east Derbyshire. After a seam of coal had been reached at Shireoaks in February 1859, the Shireoaks Colliery Company was formed, and was formally registered in December 1864. They began acquiring mining interests throughout the area, including Whitwell, Clowne and Steetley, where the sinking of a shaft began in May 1873. The miners reached a seam of coal in December 1875, and this created a turning point in the history of Worksop: from an agricultural town to an industrial powerhouse, boosting its population and creating a prosperous future. Steetley only had a single shaft, which made ventilation difficult. Shireoaks Colliery Company continued to expand their operations, and began sinking a shaft for Whitwell Colliery on Belph Moor on 24 May 1890. They intended that the two mines would work together, with the Steetley shaft used as the intake or downcast for fresh air, and Whitwell providing the return or uptake. Working 5 and a half days a week, 22 men working as two teams found coal on 23 October 1891, when they reached the Top Hard seam below Belph Moor. They continued downwards, and reached the High Hazel seam below that. From the lower level, a heading was driven towards Steetley, and the ventilation system was established when the two mines were linked in 1894. A second shaft was built at Whitwell, reaching the Top Hard seam on 15 March 1898. At this point, the ventilation system was altered, with No.1 shaft being the downcast and No.2 shaft being the uptake. Steetley was by then also connected to Shireoaks Colliery, and relied on both Whitwell and Shireoaks for its ventilation. Steetley went on to hold the record for the deepest mine in the Yorkshire coalfield. By 1950, Steetley had one of the most productive coalfaces in the area and was providing employment more than 500 people: over 40% of the total workforce in Worksop. Given its demands on the local labour force and the remoteness of the colliery, the Shireoaks Colliery Company set about establishing new housing for the Steetley workers; the pit village of Rhodesia, Nottinghamshire is one such example. By 1896, there were 340 underground workers and another 70 working on the surface. The manager was R E Jones, who was also responsible for the neighbouring Whitwell Colliery. Independent numbers for the workforce are not available for 1923, when the Colliery Year Book showed a joint figure for Steetley and Shireoaks, but in 1933, there were 460 men working underground, and the number of surface workers was the same as in 1896. H J Atkinson was the manager in both years, and again, was also responsible for Whitwell. In 1940, the number underground had decreased to 440, but those working on the surface had increased to 80, and Steetley now had its own manager, in J A Barrass. The trend continued in 1947, with a drop to 403 men underground and 83 surface workers. The manager was now L L Harrison, who had previously been the manager at Whitwell in 1940. At peak production the colliery workforce could produce up to 33,000 tonnes of coal each year. Individual coal seams were used for different purposes: the Top Hard Seam was one of the most famous in the world due to its high commercial value, while the High Hazel Seam, mined from 1956 to 1983, supplied good quality domestic fuel. Nationalisation In 1945, the Shireoaks Colliery Company was sold to United Steel Companies and on nationalisation came under the control of the National Coal Board (NCB). Together with Shireoaks, Steetley Colliery became part of the North East Division Number One Area of the NCB. Both pits were transferred to the South Yorkshire Area in March 1967, and were amalgamated in March 1983. This resulted in the closure of the surface works at Steetley, and all coal was brought up through the Shireoaks shafts. Reorganisation resulted in Shireoaks becoming part of the South Yorkshire Group in April 1990, but this was short-lived, as it closed in May. By the time the Steetley colliery was sunk, the area was also occupied by several large farms and a limestone quarry that had operated on and off for centuries. The nearby Steetley Chapel, built around 1150, is constructed of local stone from the quarry. Steetley quarry closed in the 1960s. The colliery site is in the process of being redeveloped by construction company Laing O'Rourke as an industrial complex known as Explore Industrial Park.

History  The Royal Netherlands Navy was officially founded in 1815, but existed in various forms since 1488. In the early years of the Navy, officers were trained in service aboard ships. In 1785, the 'Kweekschool voor de Zeevaart' the first land-based training school for future officers, opened. This school was the predecessor of the KIM. During the time of the Batavian Republic (1795–1806), as the Dutch Navy began to become more organized, the training school was improved as well. With the forming of the Kingdom of the Netherlands on 10 January 1816, an institute for training naval officers was founded in Delft. Twelve years later, it was moved to a site near Medemblik, and many improvements were made for the move. A boarding school system was introduced, and the institute applied for officer training. On 28 August 1829, the opening of the institute was celebrated in the great church of Medemblik. That date is now observed as the anniversary of KIM's founding. In 1854, the current campus at Willemsoord in Den Helder was opened. In 2005 the academy was incorporated in the newly founded 'Nederlandse Defensie Academy' (NLDA), which was followed by the arrival of a lot of army and air force cadets in technical studies, and the transfer of midshipmen that followed non-technical studies to Breda, effectively ending its role as a 'maritime' academy.

Taxonomy and systematics  The bird's common name and Latin binomial commemorate the British ornithologist John Sidney Ash.  Description  Ash's lark is typically in length. It has greyish-brown upperparts with paler edging to its mantle feathers, a buff- coloured underbelly and underparts with brownish streaks, a paler belly and vent, a light crest, and buff eyebrow stripes. Such a description is insufficient, however, since as with some other lark species it is difficult to definitively describe the bird without comparison to its close relatives. In the case of Ash's lark, it is smaller than the rufous-naped lark or the red-winged lark, and more greyish and marked on its mantle than either the singing lark (which has a thicker bill) or the pink-breasted lark (which has a pinkish breast). Its songs have yet to be identified.  Distribution and habitat  Population data of Ash's lark from recent decades has been greatly lacking. Political unrest has prevented accurate fieldwork in the region for many years. The only place known to be home to Ash's lark is a small area just north of Uarsciek in south-eastern Somalia, about north of Mogadishu. Even here where it is locally common, however, Ash's lark is easily overlooked because it shares the area with nine other species of lark, including both the red-winged lark and Somali long-billed lark. It is possible that Ash's lark is also present along the coast somewhat to the north of its known range since much of this land is little explored by ornithologists. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical dry lowland grassland. Behaviour and ecology Typical behaviour is to run across bare ground between bunches of grass prior to perching atop a tussock. It is threatened by habitat loss to coastal development. At present, little is known of Ash's lark's ecological relationships.

Like scissors, a board shear uses two blades to apply shear stress exceeding the paper's shear strength in order to cut. The stationary blade forms the edge of the cutting table, with the moving blade mounted on a cutting arm. Originally known as a table gauge shear because its gauge allowed the cutting of consistently-sized materials, the board shear resembles a larger version of the paper cutters commonly found in offices. The earliest known reference to a board shear comes from an 1842 supplement to Penny Magazine, titled A Day at a Bookbinder's, which included a drawing of a board shear with many of the major developments already present. An 1854 article on the history of bookbinding from The Bookbinder's Trade Circular describes early board shears, and places their development in \\"about 1836\\"; credit for the invention is ascribed to Warren De La Rue in the Reports of the Juries from the Great Exhibition of 1851. Many modifications of the basic design were made in the 19th century, with changes such as rack-and- pinion adjustment for the outer gaugeBrombacher, C.

It was the first city theatre, based on the Teatro Olimpico in Italy.In Dutch, \\"Schouwburg\\" is now often synonymous with \\"theatre\\", but not always. A schouwburg is, most often, a playhouse, lijsttheater or proscenium arch theatre. The site is now occupied by a \\"\\" hotel. The theatre was built in 1637, by Jacob van Campen, who coined the word Schouwburg for it. It replaced the Duytsche Academy of Samuel Coster previously on the site, originally set up to broaden access to science by putting on lectures in the national vernacular rather than Latin (although other activities also took place, such as painting competitions). Coster, together with playwright Bredero, had had this Academy built as a simple wooden building, to the Italian model, in 1617. Both Coster and Bredero came from the tradition of Rederijkers, and both were members been of the Rederijker \\"In Liefde Bloeyende\\". These societies developed in the early 17th century and, through their study of poetic texts, marked the beginnings of modern theatre in the Netherlands. Amsterdam was in the midst of her Golden Age, and gradually the possibility a permanent theater building began to be debated. Van Campen, known as an architect and the designer of the Royal Palace, designed a simple permanent theatre, again according to the contemporary Italian example from that time, to replace the Academy. This theatre was due to be opened on 26 December 1637 with Gijsbrecht van Aemstel, a play specially written for the occasion by Vondel. Vondel had also written the text in the architrave of the theatre's entrance: :De weereld is een speeltoneel :Elck speelt zijn rol en krijght zijn deel :(The world is a theatre, :Everyone plays his role and gets his part) This entrance still survives from the original building. The Calvinist kerkeraad (church council) of the municipality, however, attempted to stop the theatre opening, but were only temporarily successful, for the theatre was in the end still opened on 3 January 1638, with Vondel's play. The theater of Van Campen served until 1664, when it became clear it was too small and ill-keeping with the Baroque architecture of the 1660s. The theatre temporarily closed at the outbreak of the Second Anglo-Dutch War and the new building, - twice as large as the old one and adapted to the requirements of that time - finally opened May 26, 1665. This theatre burned in 1772 after a rope caught fire after a performance.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Yankees, Pittsburgh Pirates, Atlanta Braves, and Miami Marlins from 2008 through 2020. The Yankees signed Cervelli as an international free agent in 2003. He made his MLB debut with the Yankees in 2008, and played on the 2009 World Series championship team that beat the Philadelphia Phillies. He also played in the 2009 and 2013 World Baseball Classics for the Italian national team. He was acquired by the Pirates in November 2014. The Pirates traded Cervelli to Atlanta in 2019, and he played for Miami in 2020 before announcing his retirement. Early life Francisco Cervelli was born in Valencia, Venezuela, to an Italian immigrant father, Emanuele Cervelli, and a Venezuelan mother, Damelis. He also has a sister. In Venezuela, Cervelli played shortstop, second base, and sometimes pitched. The Yankees signed him as an international free agent with the understanding that he would try catching. Minor leagues Cervelli played in the Dominican Summer League in 2003. Initially a switch hitter, the Yankees had Cervelli focus on right- handed hitting. After struggling to adjust to professional baseball in 2004 and 2005, Cervelli batted .309 for the Staten Island Yankees of the Class A-Short Season New York–Penn League in 2006. In 2007, he played for the Tampa Yankees of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League, where he batted .279 with an on-base percentage of .387 and two home runs. Baseball America rated him the Yankees' 23rd-best prospect prior for the 2008 season. On March 8, 2008, Cervelli fractured his wrist on a controversial play during a spring training game against the Tampa Bay Rays, when Rays infielder Elliot Johnson collided with him at home plate in the ninth inning. Joe Girardi, the Yankees manager said, \\"I think it was uncalled for, it's spring training and you are going to get people hurt and we got Cervelli hurt.\\" He did not return to action until June. Cervelli began the 2009 season with the Trenton Thunder of the Class AA Eastern League. Major league career New York Yankees Following the completion of the 2008 minor league season, Cervelli was called up to the Yankees. He made his major league debut on September 18, 2008, as a defensive replacement. He batted 0-for-5 in his brief time in the majors. Cervelli with the Yankees After starting the 2009 season in the minors, Cervelli was called up by the Yankees on May 5, 2009, when Jorge Posada was placed on the 15-day disabled list, though he was batting only .190, with a .266 on-base percentage and .310 slugging percentage at Trenton at the time of the call-up, and had not played in Class AAA. He made his first major league start on May 7, after José Molina injured his quad. He recorded his first major league hit, a single, on May 8, against the Baltimore Orioles, while also catching starting pitcher CC Sabathia during a complete game shutout. Cervelli asserted himself as a reliable defensive catcher for the New York Yankees, and received praise from his teammates.Will the Yankees Have the Courage to Give Francisco Cervelli a Long-Term Shot? Bleacher Report Though Cervelli was sent to the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees of the Class AAA International League on July 8, 2009. when Molina was activated off of the disabled list, Yankees' manager Joe Girardi made clear that he was impressed with Cervelli's performance. On June 24, 2009, Cervelli hit his first major league home run against Kris Medlen of the Atlanta Braves, breaking up a no- hitter. On September 16, Cervelli had his first walk-off hit – a single in the bottom of the ninth inning against the Toronto Blue Jays. Cervelli was a member of the Yankees roster in the 2009 MLB postseason, as the Yankees won the 2009 World Series, but he was not on the World Series roster. Cervelli started the 2010 season on the Yankees' 25-man roster to serve as the backup catcher to Posada, and served as the Yankees' starting catcher while Posada recovered from a foot injury.Francisco Cervelli Running Out of Gas, Jorge Posada's Return To Help Bleacher Report On March 6, Cervelli was hit in the head by a pitch. He was removed from the game with a concussion. Shortly after, citing another concussion Cervelli suffered while playing winter ball, the Yankees suggested he begin wearing the Rawlings S-100 protective helmet, a bulkier model made to withstand 100 mph fastballs. This briefly earned him the nickname \\"Gazoo\\", a reference to a character in The Flintstones. Cervelli (right) with Rafael Soriano In 2011, Cervelli entered spring training as the backup to Russell Martin. Cervelli broke his foot in early March, and missed the beginning of the 2011 season. On April 29, 2011, the New York Yankees activated Cervelli from the disabled list,King of the Fist Pumps returns from the DL River Avenue Blues and on May 8, he hit his first home run of the season, also the first grand slam of his career, in a series tiebreaker on the road against Texas. Cervelli was optioned to Scranton/Wilkes-Barre to begin the 2012 season, with Chris Stewart winning the job as Martin's backup. Cervelli admitted that he moped following the demotion, until his parents visited him during the season and refocused him on improving his game. The Yankees recalled Cervelli to the majors when rosters expanded on September 1. When Martin signed with the Pittsburgh Pirates, Cervelli became the starting catcher for the Yankees in 2013. In a game against the Blue Jays on April 26, Cervelli suffered a fractured right hand after getting hit by a foul tip by outfielder Rajai Davis; he then underwent surgery the next day and was placed on the 60-day disabled list. On August 5, 2013, Cervelli was suspended for 50 games after being linked with the Biogenesis scandal. Cervelli competed with John Ryan Murphy and Austin Romine to be the backup catcher for the Yankees in spring training in 2014. Cervelli won the job, but suffered a hamstring injury on April 13, and was placed on the 60-day disabled list. He returned to the Yankees on June 17.

This flightless species is only known from bones and was presumably driven extinct by visiting sealers and the rats they introduced. A 1696 sighting by William de Vlaming of \\"four-footed animals\\" in the reeds of Amsterdam Island may have been of this duck, as there are no native land mammals on the island. No naturalist visited Amsterdam Island until 1874, by which time it was infested with rats from visiting ships, and the duck was extinct. The first bones of this species to be discovered, in 1955–56, were thought to most closely resemble those of a garganey. In 1987 bones of at least 33 individuals were recovered from rock cavities, revealing a very small duck with a short pointed bill like a wigeon's. Strong legs and reduced breastbone and wings show it was flightless. The skull's reduced salt glands indicate it was drinking little seawater, and its bones were recovered from sea level up to 500 m, suggesting it was not living on the coast. It was named Anas marecula, after the former wigeon genus Mareca. During his visit to Île Saint-Paul (St Paul Island) on 2 February 1793, explorer John Barrow mentioned the presence of \\"a small brown duck, not much larger than a thrush\\" that was \\"the favourite food of the five sealers living on the island\\". Because Amsterdam Island is 80 km away, these ducks would represent an independent case of dispersal and flightlessness, similar to the Amsterdam wigeon, but a different species.

Her purpose was to aid ships, usually by towing, on the high seas or in combat or post-combat areas, plus \\"other duties as assigned.\\" She served in the Atlantic Ocean performing various tasks. Seneca was laid down at Philadelphia on 7 September 1942 by the Cramp Shipbuilding Co. and launched on 2 February 1943. The vessel was commissioned at the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 30 April 1943, Lt. Herman B. Conrad commanding.  World War II North Atlantic operations  The tug completed fitting out and post-commissioning availability on 19 May and departed for trials, drills, and calibrations in the Delaware Bay. Three days later, she cleared the Delaware Capes and arrived at Norfolk, Virginia, for shakedown training. Seneca next stood out of Norfolk on 18 June, towing a target raft to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. From 27 June until 7 July, she conducted anti-submarine warfare (ASW) training in the Guantanamo Bay operating area; then she headed for Trinidad to begin a tour of duty with the U.S. 4th Fleet.  Rescuing German U-boat survivors  For the next 21 months, Seneca was assigned target towing, general rescue, and salvage duties in the waters off the coast of Brazil. During one of her early rescue missions, Seneca captured two survivors of a German U-boat sunk by Allied ASW patrols. Seneca was re-designated ATF-91 on 15 May 1944. On 9 April 1945, she departed Bermuda for Norfolk with a dual tow. Upon arrival, she entered the Norfolk Navy Yard for overhaul. On 25 May 1945, she cleared Norfolk for a tour of duty at Port Everglades, Florida, and Key West, Florida, with the Surface Group of the Anti-submarine Development Detachment. She towed targets and recovered torpedoes until her departure from Key West on 19 February 1946. Seneca towed a large floating crane to Philadelphia, arrived on the 26th, and later shifted to Norfolk for overhaul.  Post-war operations  Following overhaul, Seneca commenced 25 years of operations out of Norfolk and Little Creek, Virginia. Her routine during this time consisted of target towing, rescue and salvage work, and ship towing; most often these were reserve ships moving from one berthing area to another or former Navy ships to be sunk as targets. Her sphere of operations consisted of the Atlantic seaboard, the Caribbean, and the Gulf of Mexico. She spent much of her career in the Guantanamo Bay area and in the British West Indies, but also frequented the New England, Canadian, and Greenland coasts. On one occasion, she even made a tow to Reykjavík, Iceland. Between 1946 and 1971, Seneca only ventured out of the western Atlantic three times. On 1 May 1961, she departed Mayport, Florida, with AFBD-7 in tow and made Holy Loch, Scotland, a month later. Leaving her charge at Holy Loch, Seneca sailed to Penzance, England, on 5 June. She stood out of Penzance on 13 June and arrived in Norfolk, Virginia, on 24 June. In the summer of 1964, she participated in the tow of and YFNB-36 from Norfolk to Rota, Spain. She sailed to the Mediterranean in 1966 for a five-month deployment with the U.S. 6th Fleet after which she resumed her normal routine in the western Atlantic. Three of her more important evolutions before decommissioning were the tows of the Aircraft Carriers Essex and Randolph from the Boston Army Piers in Boston to the Brooklyn Navy Yard and tows of WW II Vessels from the Hudson River Reserve Fleet in the ongoing effort to clean up the Hudson encouraged by President Nixon.  Decommissioning  Decommissioned in July 1971, Seneca was transferred to the Maritime Administration on 18 November 1971 for lay up with the James River Group, National Defense Reserve Fleet, Fort Eustis, Virginia. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 30 October 1985. In the late 1980s, the ship was modified at the United States Coast Guard Yard for use as floating laboratory space. The ship was moored at the former Engineering Experiment StationNSWC Carderock Division, George W. Melville in Annapolis, Maryland, later part of the Carderock Division of the Naval Surface Warfare Center. She continued to serve in this capacity until 18 June 1997, when she was towed to Portsmouth, Virginia. She was finally sunk as a target along with the submarine tender and the destroyer tender in the Atlantic Ocean off North Carolina on 21 July 2003.

To the fifth month of the lunar calendar, the festival of the Pure Qingming Light is specifically devoted to the ancestors. On the family furnace bridge and the tombs, the ancestors of the family receive food offerings. Candles are lit, of the incense sticks are consumed. Very followed with the Meeting, this worship is one of the bases of the Chinese culture. One finds it in all the religious and spiritual practices of old China: Taoism, Buddhism, Confucianism. Qingming jie is intended to honour the spirits with the members missing from the family so that they continue to rest in peace and take care on their descent. *Chinese New Year's Day. The festival of the Chinese New Year's Day is most known of all réunionnais them (at the end of January). And due: it is marked as of the morning and until late in the night by the din of the detonators. By this backfire, the children endeavour to their larger cheek to frighten and draw aside the bad spirits of the festivities. The Chinese New Year's Day is marked by public cultural activityc(ap)s, processions, spectacles of dance which contribute to make it very popular. The midnight supper takes place in family or, more and more often, outside in a restaurant under the aegis of one of the Chinese religious organizations. The New Year's Day is one of the rare moments of the year, if not only, where the Chinese shops are closed. *The festival of Guan Yu.

It has been designated an Important Bird Area in the Middle East (BirdLife International, 1994), is included in the Directory of Wetlands in the Middle East (IUCN, 1995), was declared Ramsar Convention site number 978 in 1999, and most recently (2005) was designated, with Al Shouf Cedar Nature Reserve, a “Biosphere reserve” by UNESCO.  Description  The swamp lies on one of the most important bird migration routes in the world, and over 250 species of birds have been recorded in the area, including the globally vulnerable greater spotted eagle (Aquila clanga), eastern imperial eagle (Aquila heliaca), and lesser kestrel (Falco naumanni). Records of globally near-threatened bird species at the wetland include great snipe (Gallinago media), ferruginous duck (Aythya nyroca) and pallid harrier (Circus macrourus). In addition to the great diversity of birds in the area, there are a wide variety of animals living in and around the marsh. Twenty-three species of mammals have been recorded, including jungle cat (Felis chaus) and European otter (Lutra lutra). Five species of amphibians and twelve species of reptiles have been recorded, and a two-year weekly butterfly survey found fifty-three species of butterflies in the area. The wetland lies 7 km SSW of the city of Qab Elias on the eastern edge of Mount Lebanon. The main area of reedbeds and open pools covers 253 ha, stretching east from the foot of the mountains to the Litani River in a long strip. Rain and snow falling on the high ridge of Barouk mountain to the west provide water for the wetland. Most rain falls between December and March, soaking quickly through layers of limestone in the mountains and emerging as springs in the valley floor. The water is particularly pure, as it has not been polluted by agricultural fertilizers, pesticides, etc. In recent years the marsh dried out by mid-July (with the exception of a few deep pools and ditches) and did not fill up again until January or February. However, the introduction by A Rocha's involvement of improved management techniques, such as the reduced pumping of water for irrigation of nearby farmland, and changes to less “thirsty” crops, has helped the marsh remain wet throughout the year. This has resulted in a significant increase in wintering and breeding water birds since 2002. Surrounding the open water and reed bed are areas of rough grazing, cultivated land, drainage ditches, and an avenue of trees, all adding to the diversity of habitats in the area. On the nearby mountain slopes, small wooded areas and rocky shrubland give an even greater variety of habitats and species. Behind the nearby village of Aammiq are woods where Syrian woodpecker (Dendrocopus syriacus) and Syrian serin (Serinus syriacus) can be found. In spring and summer, shrubby hillsides are home to assorted buntings, wheatears, warblers and shrikes, and rocky gorges host western rock nuthatch (Sitta neumayer) and Eurasian eagle owl (Bubo bubo). Mammals present include Caucasian squirrel, wildcat, wild boar and the elusive Indian porcupine. Long- eared owl caught during ringing activity The Aammiq Wetland and some of the surrounding area is in the process of being declared a National Reserve. The main landowning family is fully engaged in the preservation of this very important ecosystem and initial plans to develop the area for ecotourism are underway.  Scientific studies  Since the founding of A Rocha Lebanon in 1996, a great deal of scientific study has been undertaken and much has been learned about the flora and fauna of Lebanon and in particular the West Bekaa. Research has been conducted in the form of preliminary studies, short- and long-term projects and an ongoing monitoring program. A number of short-term research projects have been carried out which have greatly increased the knowledge of bird life in Lebanon, such as an autumn migrant bird survey (1998), a survey of birds on the mountain slopes above Aammiq (1999/2000), and a study of the autumn routes of migrating raptors and other soaring birds in Lebanon (2000). Various archaeological studies have been carried out on the site of Aammiq including pollen core analysis.  Fauna  Mammals: The following descriptions of mammals of the Ammiq wetlands have all been recorded by A Rocha personnel in the Aammiq region from 1997 onwards. The region covered includes not just the valley floor wetlands but also the adjacent farmlands and the slopes of Mount Barouk. In addition to these, other mammal species are probably present but have not yet been positively identified. One mammal of interest is the European otter Lutra lutra which was reported in the Aammiq wetlands prior to 1975; its reappearance was confirmed in June 2003. Water buffalos were introduced to the swamp in order to maintain the health of the vegetation cover and the swamp itself, since buffalo graze wetlands in a more efficient way than other herbivores. The mammals recorded in the region include: southern white-breasted hedgehog (Erinaceus concolor), Cape hare (Lepus capensis), Caucasian squirrel (Sciurus anomalus), Indian porcupine (Hystrix indica), gray wolf (Canis lupus), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), European otter (Lutra lutra), European badger (Meles meles), striped hyena (Hyaena hyaena), mountain gazelle (Gazella gazella), wild boar (Sus scrofa). File:Water_buffalo.jpgWater buffalo File:Mountain_gazelle.jpgMountain gazelle File:Lebanon Deers.jpgEuropean fallow deer Birds: Nearly 260 bird species have been recorded in the Aammiq region either by A Rocha personnel or people working with A Rocha from 1996 onwards. The Aammiq region includes not just the valley floor wetlands but also the adjacent farmlands and the sometimes wooded rocky slopes of Mount Barouk. The listing of these birds does not give any idea of their abundance or status. While some of the birds recorded below are residents, others are passage migrants. Some of these, such as the white stork and the lesser spotted eagle, may pass over Aammiq in flocks of hundreds at a time. Other migrants fly over in far smaller numbers. Species include: pygmy cormorant (Phalacrocorax pygmeus), white pelican (Pelecanus onocrotalus), greater flamingo (Phoenicopterus rubber), ferruginous duck (Aythya nyroca), osprey (Pandion haliaetus), Verreaux's eagle (Aquila verreauxii), peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), common crane (Grus grus), rock pigeon (Columba livia).

As with the other species lists, the Aammiq region is here taken to include not just the valley floor wetlands, which are very rich in reptiles, but also the adjacent farmlands and the rocky slopes of Mount Barouk. Herpetology, the study of reptiles and amphibians, is a specialised field and as yet there has been no systematic A Rocha herpetological survey of this area. Far more species are known to exist in the area than the ones reported. Species include: European green toad (Bufo viridis), Levantine frog (Pelophylax bedriagae), Levant green lizard (Lacerta media), European worm snake (Typhlops vermicularis), Levant viper (Macrovipera lebetina). Image:1315p.jpg European green toad Image:Mediterranean tree frog (Ammiq Wetland, Lebanon).jpg Mediterranean tree frog Moths, butterflies, and dragonflies: As with many other groups, the moths of the Aammiq region are poorly known. The list below represents an incomplete and provisional list of species so far recorded, though the Aammiq region is rich in butterflies. A Rocha personnel recorded several new records of species since 1998 such as: Oriental marbled skipper (Carcharodus boeticus), swallowtail (Papilio machaon), scarce swallowtail (Iphiclides podalirius), false Apollo (Archon apollinus), large white (Pieris brassicae), plain tiger (Danaus chrysippus), long-tailed blue (Lampides boeticus).Scarce swallowtailScarlet dragonfly Also the Aammiq region has a surprising diversity of dragonflies which can be divided into two groups, the Zygoptera (damselflies) and the Anisoptera (the insects commonly referred to as dragonflies), species include: azure damselfly (Coenagrion puella), blue- tailed damselfly (Ischnura elegans), emperor dragonfly (Anax imperator), southern darter (Sympetrum meridionale), scarlet dragonfly (Crocothemis erythraea).  Environmental education  A Rocha Lebanon has run the environmental education programme at the Aammiq Wetland since 1998. Aimed at school and university students, it has seen nearly 6000 young people come through the program to date. The program is tied in with the Lebanese schools' national curriculum and provides an opportunity for students to learn about wetland ecosystems first hand. Supporting learning in the classroom is important, but an educational visit to the marsh aims to provide students with \\"hands on\\" experiences for them to get a physical appreciation of the beauty and complexity of this unique environment.

It is home to the Hong Kong Open, a tournament co-sanctioned by the European and Asian Tours. Founded in 1889 as the Royal Hong Kong Golf Club, the Club originally played in Happy Valley, a location shared with many other activities. As the Club expanded, the need for a more permanent home was addressed with the building of a small 9-hole course at Deep Water Bay, before the Club eventually moved to its current location in Fanling, most of which is leased from the Hong Kong government.Agence France-Presse (7 August 2013). \\"Elite Hong Kong golf club could be bulldozed for flats\\". Bangkok Post. According to the Club annals, the Deep Water Bay location opened in 1898; and the 18-hole Old Course was completed in 1911. To expand the facility, in 1968, the Club negotiated the lease of around 30 acres of land at Beas River with which it expanded the Eden Course into a full 18-hole championship course. The 'Royal' was dropped from the name of the club in 1996, in advance of the transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong from the United Kingdom to the People's Republic of China. The Club paid a one-off premium to lease the land, and is wrongly labelled to pay only a peppercorn rent annually. In 2012, the Club paid HK$1.9 million for rent and HK$3.2 million for rates.Hong Kong Golf Club has proud tradition In Year 2013/2014, the Government Rent Payable is HK$2,538,000.LC Paper No. CB(2)285/13-14(01)  History  1889–1910 On 8 May 1889, a notice was published on the Hong Kong Daily Press: The first meeting of Hong Kong Golf Club was held at the first Hong Kong Club clubhouse at the corner of Wyndham Street and Queen's Road in 1889. Then, the \\"Royal Hong Kong Golf Club\\" was started in 1889 by \\"thirteen golfing enthusiasts\\" in a shared location in Happy Valley. According to \\"History of the Royal Hongkong Golf Club\\", which was written by T.F.R. Waters, of these thirteen, with the exception of Robert Murray Rumsey R.N. (then Hong Kong Harbour Master and the Rumsey Street was named after his name.) and Gershom Stewart (afterwards Knighted and a member of parliament for Hoylake) very few had much notion of the game but readily agreed to do what they could to established a foothold for it in the Colony. Although Captain Rumsey and Stewart had clubs and balls and had in fact been driving these balls within the race track at Happy Valley before 1889, the opinion of the Meeting was that attempts should be made to acquire land then in possession of the military in Kowloon. Rumsey had been elected captain of the new club and had secured the consent of His Excellency the Governor – Sir William Des Voeux – to accept the presidency. Despite this influence at Court the military authorities could not be persuaded to become cooperative, and after some months the proposition had to be dropped. However, on 30 September 1889 permission was eventually obtained from Hong Kong Government to use ground at Happy Valley. Money was raised and work was started making the greens and tees. The architect of the course at Happy Valley was Captain (afterwards Colonel) H. N. Dumbleton R.E. The work progressed rapidly, and it is recorded that in May 1890 a match of six a side was played between the Club and the 91st Regiment of the Argyle and Sutherland Highlanders, which the Club won easily.Waters, T.F.R., \\"History of the Royal Hong Kong Golf Club\\", p.5-6 In 1896, Captain Rumsey and Captain Dumbleton examined the possibilities of Deep Water Bay as a possible solution to the ever-increasing pressure from the ladies for extension of their very restricted privileges at Happy Valley as imposed by Commodore Boyes. Negotiations were opened with Government in June 1897 and with the not inconsiderable assistance of the Governor himself, Sir William Robinson, \\"the best friend the Club ever had\\", a lease of land for a small nine-hole course at Deep Water Bay was concluded with Hong Kong government in 1898.Waters, T.F.R., \\"History of the Royal Hong Kong Golf Club\\", p.9 Deep Water Bay golf course On 1 September 1897 as a result of a letter addressed to Her Majesty Queen Victoria's Lord Chamberlain the following reply was addressed to Sir William Robinson G.C.M.G. Governor of Hong Kong: \\"Sir, With reference to your dispatch of 20th July addressed to the Right Honorable The Lord Chamberlain, The Earl of Lothian, I have the honour to inform you that on your application being laid before The Queen, Her Majesty was graciously pleased, in view of your recommendations, to give Her permission to the Hong Kong Golf Club being called 'The Royal Hong Kong Golf Club'.\\" This announcement was received with great acclaim and duly celebrated by a banquet at which Sir William was an honoured guest.Waters, T.F.R., History of the Royal Hong Kong Golf Club, p.10 In 1903, the Club obtained exclusive use of Happy Valley ground except for Wednesdays and Saturdays, when soccer and cricket were played. From the start, use by ladies was heavily restricted. And when the club gained exclusive use of Happy Valley in 1903, ladies were allowed to play on Sundays only. In connection with this sharing of the ground at Happy Valley there is on record this remark made by the Captain at the Annual General Meeting of 1903 in connection with the playing of the final of the Club Championship at Happy Valley \\"The thanks of the Players are due to the Cricketers who so kindly stopped their game to let the Golfers through on each round.\\" The proximity of the Golf Course to the football ground on occasions lead to misdirected shots landing in the football arena but no one seems to have been hit. There was however one occasion when the late \\"Auntie\\" Maitland misdirected her drive from the 1st tee and caused serious injury to the eye of a Marine.Waters, T.F.R., \\"History of the Royal Hong Kong Golf Club\\", p.12 1911–1945 According to the Club annals, \\"protracted negotiations\\" with the government and local farmers resulted in sufficient land being obtained in Fanling, its current location, to build its first full 18-hole course that was completed in 1911. The first idea was to use the Sun Wei valley but the Army Authorities opposed this. Messrs. T. S. Forrest, K. M. Cumming, L. S. Greenhill and M. A. Murray were appointed by the Club to view this grazing land. Their report was enthusiastic and favourable. Negotiations with Government were opened (1908) for a lease of sufficient land for a full- size 18-hole course to be constructed. These negotiations with Government were protracted despite the Club receiving a great deal of assistance from the Governor, Sir Henry May, in dealing with the local farmers in the matter of acquiring certain extra pieces of land considered essential by the course architects. It was said that E.R. Hallifax, the then Tai Po District Officer, was the man more than any other responsible for the construction of a course at Fanling golf course. The relationship of the District Officer with the village elders everywhere was avuncular or, indeed, almost paternal.Robinson, S. (1989), Festina Lente: A History of the Royal Hong Kong Golf Club, p.11 In 1916, Sir Henry May arranged for the Club to acquire additional land to form a Relief Course for the use of the Ladies. At the time the Old Course was laid out, there were no trees at all on the course except down by the 3rd green and one or two near the clubhouse site. Much forestry work was undertaken during the period 1915–1919 but there was still very little to show yet except beautiful clumps of lilies and cannas on the hillsides. Grave mounds, or \\"pimples\\", as they were known, plus innumerable jars of human bones, existed on many of the fairways, but these were for the most part removed in 1920 as the result of a generous grant through Sir Henry May of $50,000, which was paid out as compensation to the families owning them. There was a particularly large number of the \\"jars\\" at the base of the \\"saddle\\" or, as it is known today, \\"Tommy Tucker\\" (derived from the Cantonese \\"Mm ta-ka ()\\" – don't strike). These jars unfortunately were in direct line from the tee and got broken one by one by duffed tee-shots. The penalty for picking out was one stroke but the picking was usually left to the caddie.Waters, T.F.R., \\"History of the Royal Hong Kong Golf Club\\", p. 16 Trees were conspicuous by their absence, but then so was the grass on the fairways which were more rolled mud than anything else. This made the fairways very dusty especially on a windy day. The Greens were turfed with local grass, much of it 'cabbage', which made putting difficult whilst a great deal of trouble was constantly experienced from worms which fed upon the young fresh roots and didn't give the Green keepers a chance. The course was almost devoid all that there was a great deal of room for improving the original layout. The Committee appointed Mr. L.S. Greenhill to work out with Mr. Kerr (who had been general manager of the Club since 1914 and resided in the Orme Bungalow) on a new lay out and new bunkering.Waters, T.F.R., \\"History of the Royal Hong Kong Golf Club\\", p. 17–18 In 1919, a caddies union was discovered called \\"Po Tai Ngoi Yue\\" – Golf Caddies Club – which turned out to be a semi-triad society. The first caddie strike took place in April 1922 and was eventually settled.Robinson, S. (1989) \\"Festina Lente, A History of the Royal Hong Kong Golf Club\\", p. 81 On 2 November 1931, the New Course which had been designed by L.S. Greenhill some years before, was officially opened by His Excellency Sir William Peel.Waters, T.F.R., \\"History of the Royal Hong Kong Golf Club\\", p. 20 It was said that Sir William Peel, the Governor of Hong Kong in early 1930s, was a keen golfer. Little was allowed to interfere with his weekly round of golf or his regular rides with the Fanling Hunt. He rode hard, plunging across the terraced rice fields, bogging down at times in the waterlogged mud.Spurr, Russell; \\"Excellency: Governors of Hong Kong\\", p.162 In 1933, George Bernard Shaw visited the Club.Hong Kong Golf in the 1960s – Part Two In 1936, Mr. Stanley H. Dodwell presented a \\"Captain's Chair\\" for the bar room to commemorate the disappearance of the last of the Pimples on the Old Course. Whenever the Captain is at Fanling and any other member or subscriber sits in the chair by mistake, the penalty will be one round of drinks at that particular table in memory of the departed pimples. It was fortunate that although this Chair was looted during WWII, it was spotted being used as a Sedan Chair slung between two poles and recovered for the Club.Waters, T.F.R., \\"History of the Royal Hong Kong Golf Club\\", p. 23 1945–1989 During the 1950s, all the greens remodelled and planted with Gezira or Uganda grass. This grass has all come from a shoebox full of seeded soil taken from Uganda to Cairo during the war and one more sod of this grass was flown from Cairo to Hong Kong in 1951.Waters, T.F.R., \\"History of the Royal Hong Kong Golf Club\\", p. 27–28 Sir Sidney Gordon, C.B.E., J.P., former President of the Club, recalled his stopover at Cairo airport in 1951. \\"During the usual one-hour stopover and, as relations between the United Kingdom and Egypt were rather strained, the customs officer was somewhat suspicious of this damp, sackcloth-wrapped, parcel and insisted on it being opened. The contents made him even more suspicious but the intervention of the air crew enabled us to get it on board just before take-off.\\"Robinson, S. (1989) \\"Festina Lente, A History of the Royal Hong Kong Golf Club\\", p.1 By the end of 1956, the indebtedness of the Club had been reduced to $40,000 – a reduction of $387,000 in eight years.Waters, T.F.R., \\"History of the Royal Hong Kong Golf Club\\", p. 26 The first Hong Kong Open took place at the club in 1959.Riding Sign at Eden CourseNegotiations with the Jockey Club started in 1967 and, in due course, the Stewards of the Jockey Club agreed to recommend to their members that approximately 30 acres of land at Beas River, between the Jockey Club's West Paddock and Hang Tau Village Road, should be leased to the Golf Club. In return, the Golf Club would provide a 'ride' of about four or five miles, which would be laid out around the perimeter of the Golf Club property and would be available at all times for members of the Jockey Club. During the autumn of 1968, John Harris's proposals for the extension of the Eden Course were considered. The members approved expenditure of HK1.3 million on improvements to the Eden Course. On 10 October 1971, the 6,142-yard par-71 Eden Course was officially opened by Sir David Trench.Robinson, S. (1989) \\"Festina Lente, A History of the Royal Hong Kong Golf Club\\", p.40–46 Sir David Trench, Governor of Hong Kong from 1964 to 1971, was keen on golf. He had insisted on his regular game of golf even during the political turmoils in late 1960s.Spurr, Russell; \\"Excellency: Governors of Hong Kong\\", p.221 In October 1968, Sir David Trench was pairing with Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew to play a round of golf against Mr Gordon Macwhinnie, the Club’s Captain and Mr W.C. Choy at Fanling. 1990–now In 1996, in advance of the transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong from the United Kingdom to the People's Republic of China, the club dropped 'Royal' from its name. In the same year, Mr. Cheng Yuen, who acted as a caddie for golfers at the Deep Water Bay course of the Club from 1986 to 1995, brought a claim against the Club before the Labour Tribunal. He claimed that he was an employee of the Club and he asked for 26 days' wages in lieu of notice and a long service payment in view of his length of service. The Club's defence was that he was not an employee but an independent contractor so that he could not take advantage of the Employment Ordinance (Cap. 57) which in section 2 defines \\"contract of employment\\" as \\"any agreement, whether in writing or oral, express or implied, whereby one person agrees to employ another and that other agrees to serve his employer as an employee ...\\". The Tribunal found in his favour and awarded him HK$33,840; Mrs. Justice Bokhary in the High Court upheld that decision.Cheng Yuen v. The Royal Hong Kong Golf Club, HKLA 37/1996 The Court of Appeal allowed the Club's appeal and set aside the award in favour of Mr. Cheng.Cheng Yuen v. The Royal Hong Kong Golf Club, CACV 146/1996 On 20 May 1987 he was given special leave to appeal to the Privy Council. Despite Lord Hoffmann's dissenting opinion, the Council dismissed Cheng's appeal.Yuen v. The Royal Hong Kong Golf Club (Hong Kong) 1997/UKPC40 (28 July 1997) In 2015, the Club celebrated its 125th anniversary by offering Hong Kong residents a special HK$125 green fee rate on selected days.Anniversary Special, Community Outreach, HkGC The first Hong Kong Ladies Open took place at the club in June 2015. Tiffany Chan, a member of Hong Kong Golf Club, was qualified to play 2016 Summer Olympics. She finished for a four over total of 288 (71-75-73-69) and ranked 37 among the 60 players. Membership In 1897, the Club's membership reached 250.Waters, T.F.R., \\"History of the Royal Hong Kong Golf Club\\", p. 10 By 1923, the Club's membership reached 800. In July 1964, it was decided to close the membership. All applicants, regardless of nationality, were put on the waiting list. The policy was to put the emphasis on giving membership to established golfers as opposed to beginners.Robinson, S. (1989) \\"Festina Lente, A History of the Royal Hong Kong Golf Club\\", p.38 The Club currently has 2,510 members, including 365 corporate nominee memberships.Tearing up Fanling will destroy a unique asset St. George's v St. Andrew's St George flag at Old Course St Andrews flag at Old Course Prior to 1921, there had been several matches of Scotland versus the Rest with usually very unsatisfactory results for the members of Scottish origin. In 1921, the first St. George's versus St. Andrew's Match was played in the month of January with, until 1926, a return match in December. After 1926, the December game was dropped probably due to the many other competition taking place in that month.

The trees had been cut down for fuel and parts of the course including most of the greens had been used for vegetable cultivation. The New Course had been used for training and a large number of fox holes had been built. The clubhouse was requisitioned by the British Army after the war. The rehabilitation was as expensive as had been forecast. The Club not only spent all its account balances but had to arrange for an overdraft which at one time was over $400,000. (The price of daily newspaper in Hong Kong was 20 cents in 1947/48.) To reduce this liability a debenture issue was authorised on the basis of HK$500 per member. A few of the long established firms such as the Hong Kong Bank and Jardines also took up a number of the debentures to aid the Club.Waters, T.F.R., \\"History of the Royal Hong Kong Golf Club\\", p.25 In 1963, an EGM was called and a Fanling Development Scheme was approved. Two resolutions were passed authorising the Committee to proceed with a scheme for the extension of the Fanling clubhouse and the issue of debentures to the amount of HK$900,000 to cover the costs. A building levy of HK$5 per month for all members was also introduced. Actual and estimated capital expenditure on the improvement to the clubhouse totalled HK$1,214,000.Robinson, S. (1989) \\"Festina Lente, A History of the Royal Hong Kong Golf Club\\", p.36 In early 1970s, to raise capital for the new complex, including the swimming pool and the mixed accommodation, a scheme of Nominee Memberships was introduced. On payment of HK$5,000 – soon raised to HK$10,000 – a firm became entitled, after approval by the Club, to nominate an employee to membership. The Nominee Memberships were transferable, again subject to the Club's approval, on payment of a commission to the Club.Robinson, S. (1989) \\"Festina Lente, A History of the Royal Hong Kong Golf Club\\", p.45 At the AGM in 1980, it was decided to issue 30 Nominee Memberships to meet the expense of a redevelopment scheme to include a swimming pool and squash courts in Deep Water Bay. The new building at Deep Water Bay was completed in early 1983 at a cost of about HK$25 million.Robinson, S. (1989) \\"Festina Lente, A History of the Royal Hong Kong Golf Club\\", p.55 The financial problems were eventually overcome. Following many years of loss, a profit was reported in 1984 for the third year running. Since then, the Club has remained in the black.Robinson, S. (1989) \\"Festina Lente, A History of the Royal Hong Kong Golf Club\\", p. 47 In 1986, 10 Nominee Memberships were issued in the price of HK$1.1 million to raise fund for the building of the automatic irrigation system, which piping secondary treated effluent from the sewage treatment plant belonging to one of those estates of the new town, Shek Wu Hui. This was the last time that the Club issued Nominee Membership.張建東談「救亡」歷程 粉嶺高球場無地可取代 Visitors and green fees The Club welcomes non-member Hongkongers on weekdays at HK$1,200 per round and HK$500 if they play after 3 pm.

Happy Valley Club House In 1896, the Club House was officially opened by Commodore Boyes. This Club House had been designed by Major Edward Albert Ram, entirely on a voluntary basis, as a keen golfer. It was built of stone with the main entrance facing the racecourse; lockers lined the walls and at one end there was a stone tablet recording the Club Champions since 1894. There was a Dressing room, bar and a caretaker's room. Mrs. Rumsey unfurled the Club flag and as a special gesture a Ladies' competition was played after the opening despite the heavy rain which was falling. The women who played in this historic event were Mesdames O'Gorman, Dalrymple, Eccles, Boyes and Miss Boyes and Miss Gordon. The winner was Mrs. O'Gorman. A few months later, portraits of Sir William Des Voeux and Sir William Robinson were presented to the Club and hung in the main entrance.Waters, T.F.R., \\"History of the Royal Hong Kong Golf Club\\", p. 8-9 In 1918, the disastrous fire broke out in matsheds near the Club House at Happy Valley. The flames spread so rapidly that it proved impossible to save any of the Club's records or stocks. Nothing but ashes.Waters, T.F.R, \\"History of the Royal Hong Kong Golf Club\\", p.16 From that date the Club had been lent club room space once again by the Jockey Club but notice that this particular building was to be pulled down was given to the Golf Club at the end of 1928 and these rooms were consequently handed back to the owners in February 1929. The Club decided to build a new club House at Happy Valley at a cost of HK$30,000 and this was duly completed in November 1930 and officially opened early in 1931.Waters, T.F.R., \\"History of the Royal Hong Kong Golf Club\\", p. 20-21 After the World War II, the Club House had been thoroughly looted by the mobs during the hand-over interval as had every unoccupied residence in the Hong Kong and the Club decided to surrender this property to Government for many reasons not the least of which was financial. Deep Water Bay Club House At the Annual General Meeting in 1898, it was decided to erect a single story Club House at Deep Water Bay and this was built in 1899. Major Edward Albert Ram, who designed the Happy Valley one, once more came to the Club's aid as he had by that time become a partner of Messrs Dennison, Ram and Gibbs' architects.Waters, T.F.R., \\"History of the Royal Hong Kong Golf Club\\", p.11 During the war and after the fall of Hong Kong on Christmas Day 1941, Deep Water Bay was used by the Japanese for various purposes for the most part as a transport depot but they also built piggeries and these provided the excellent flagstones which now surround the south and east sides of the Club House. The rehabilitation of Deep Water Bay was not undertaken until 1947/48 when Frank Groves and Hector Mundy did an excellent job.Waters, T.F.R., \\"History of the Royal Hong Kong Golf Club\\", p.24 Fanling Club House Fanling clubhouse Lily Pond inside Hong Kong Golf Club By 1911, the old course had been laid out and once more Edward Albert Ram of Messrs. Dennison, Ram & Gibbs designed the clubhouse, which was not however completed until 1914 and was originally known as the Dormie House.Waters, T.F.R., \\"History of the Royal Hong Kong Golf Club\\", p14 Half Way House The Half Way House at Fanling is a Grade III historic building.Brief Information on Proposed Grade III Items. Item#805, p.430 It is located on Fanling Golf Course. Inscriptions on a board over the entrance indicate that the building was erected in 1916 by Sir Henry May and T.S. Forrest Esq. Frank Hunter, Club Captain in 1950, donated money to form the garden at the Half-way House on the occasion of his retirement from Hong Kong. The pavilion is built in traditional Chinese Qing Vernacular style consisting of a partly open-sided structure formed of columns spaced at regular internals supporting a pitched and hipped Chinese tiled roof. One end of the pavilion has been enclosed to form a kitchen. The roof is decorated with curving end ridges to the hips, and a colourful ridge-board supporting two green dragons competing for the Pearl for Wisdom. Ornamental finials in the shape of fish, dripper tiles and a colourful eaves board complete the decorations to the roof which is supported on traditional Chinese roof trusses. The plinth is formed of unusual knapped stones. There are three flights of steps. The pavilion is a rare piece of Qing architecture. It was restored in 1998 and some alternations have been made.

Environmental Stewardship and Heritage Trees According to the Club's tree survey, there are nearly 100 different species of tree on the property including three species that are deemed by the Hong Kong Government as being Old and Valuable ones. Some of the tree species at Fanling include banyan, many of which are over 80 years old, eucalyptus (there are some particularly special examples of these by the right side of the 16th tee of the Old Course) as well as indigenous camphor trees, acacias, ironwoods, Norfolk pines and paper barks. In 2015, the Club launched educational guided tours for local schools and organizations on specially designed tree trails over the three courses in Fanling. Besides, the Club also announced to join the Audubon Cooperative Sanctuary Programme for Golf.

The Maquis du Vercors used the prominent scenic plateau known as the Massif du Vercors (Vercors Plateau) as a refuge. Initially the maquis carried out only sabotage and partisan operations against the Germans, but after the Normandy Invasion on 6 June 1944, the leadership of an army of about 4,000 maquis declared the \\"Free Republic of Vercors,\\" raised the French flag, and attempted to create a conventional army to oppose the German occupation. The allies supported the maquis with parachute drops of weapons and by supplying teams of advisors and trainers, but the uprising was premature. In July 1944 as many as 10,000 German soldiers invaded the massif and killed more than 600 of the maquis, known as maquisards, and 200 civilians. It was German's largest anti-partisan operation in Western Europe during World War II. In August 1944, shortly after the battle for the Vercors, the area was liberated from German control by the American army allied with the FFI. Geography The Vercors Massif is a roughly triangular-shaped plateau with a maximum north-south length of and a maximum width of . The area is . The lowlands surrounding the steep-sided plateau average about in elevation above sea level while the top of the massif has an average elevation of about with a maximum elevation of at Grand Veymont.Le Grand Veymont, Peakbagger.com, retrieved 27 February 2012Google Earth Unlike a flat-topped mesa, three ridges run along the top of the massif from north to south. Only a few roads climb the steep slopes to access the massif and the population lives in a few small villages. The porous limestone rocks and karst terrain result in an extensive system of caves and caverns and a scarcity of surface water in the form of streams, springs, and shallow wells. These characteristics would be important during the battle as the Germans took control of the water sources and ambushed maquis seeking water. The city of Grenoble, which had a large German military presence, is situated at the foot of the steep cliffs of the Vercors Massif at its northeastern edge. An important German air force base was located at Chabeuil, just below the southwestern rim of the Vercors. Background Beginning in 1942, the Service du Travail Obligatoire (STO) (Compulsory Work Service) resulted in the deportation of hundreds of thousands of young French men to Nazi Germany to work as labour for the German war effort. To avoid the STO tens of thousands of men fled to the mountains and forests of France and joined the maquis, the rural resistance fighters against the German occupation. In 1943, three men, mountaineer Pierre Dalloz, soldier Alain Le Ray, and writer Jean Prévost developed a plan to use the Vercors as a redoubt and a staging area for resistance to the German occupation. In August 1943, Francis Cammaerts, code named Roger, an agent of the United Kingdom's clandestine Special Operations Executive (S0E) organization, journeyed to the Vercors and met with French soldier Eugène Chavant. Cammaerts liked the Vercors plan. He foresaw the Vercors and other nearby mountainous areas as drop zones for allied paratroopers who would work with the local maquis to tie down German military forces and assist the Allied forces in the contemplated invasion of southern France (Operation Dragoon) which was then in the planning stages. Cammaerts arranged for the first airdrop of arms and supplies by the SOE to the Vercors maquis on 13 November 1943. On January 6, 1944, a three-man \\"Union\\" mission, including US Marine Peter Ortiz from the American Office of Strategic Services (OSS), Colonel Pierre Fourcaud, of the French secret service, and Harry Thackthwaite of the SOE, to evaluate the capabilities of the Resistance in the Alpine region of France. Along with Cammaerts they organized, trained, and armed the maquis to prepare them for an important role in support of the allied invasion of southern France. The Union group departed France in May 1944. The Germans had no soldiers stationed on the Vercors Massif, but in response to sabotage activities of the maquis conducted periodic raids usually launched from Grenoble. The first raid was on 25 November 1943 and resulted in a wireless operator captured and another wounded. The Germans also used the Milice (a pro-German French paramilitary militia) to suppress the growing strength of the resistance on the Vercors massif. On April 15, 1944 a caravan of 25 Milice vehicles attacked the village of Vassieux, burning several farms and shooting or deporting some of the inhabitants. Mixed signals In the weeks leading up to the invasion of Normandy (D-Day) on 6 June 1944, the guidance and instructions given by the Allies to the maquis on the Vercors Massif were contradictory and inconsistent. One issue was whether the maquis should rise in armed opposition to the Germans immediately after D-Day or wait until later when they could be of maximum help to the allies. The contradictions are illustrated by the differences in the D-Day messages of allied commander Dwight D. Eisenhower and Free French leader Charles de Gaulle. Eisenhower urged all the maquis in France to be cautious and patient; De Gaulle's emotional message was interpreted by the maquis as a call to take up arms immediately. On D-Day, Cammaerts on the Vercors Massif, gave the message to the maquis that, while clandestine sabotage should continue, they should remain hidden as \\"it would be at least two months before they would be needed.\\" Cammaerts knew also that similar uprisings in other areas had been crushed by the Germans. To the contrary on June 8, Marcel Descour, the regional leader of the French Resistance, instructed Francois Huet, the newly-named commander of the Vercors marquis, to mobilize. When Huet objected that he had neither the men nor the arms to defend Vercors, Descour assured him that the allies would send reinforcements. The expectations of the Vercors maquis were that the invasion of southern France would be shortly after D-Day, when in reality it took place more than two months later. The maquis also anticipated incorrectly that allied paratroopers would land on the massif to assist them and that they would be supplied with anti-tank and other heavy weapons to fight the Germans. \\"We shall not forget the bitterness of having been abandoned alone and without support in time of battle,\\" wired the French Forces of the Interior (FFI) commander to London. The priorities of the allied forces were the Normandy front and the upcoming Operation Dragoon landing in Southern France, not the maquis of Vercors. German attacks German repression of the maquis on the Vercors Massif began on 11 June with a reconnaissance-in-force from the city of Grenoble to the village of Saint-Nizier-du-Moucherotte. The small German force was repulsed by the maquis controlling the only road leading up the massif to Saint-Nizier. On 15 June the Germans returned with artillery and a larger force and forced the maquis to withdraw. During the remainder of June, the Germans sent several more probing attacks onto the Vercors. The allies parachuted arms and supplies to the maquis on 27 June and the allies sent two teams to help them: An OSS team of 15 American soldiers commanded by Lt. Vernon G. Hoppers and a four-man SOE team headed by Major Desmond Longe. Longe spoke little or no French and Cammaerts took offense at the unannounced arrival of Longe's team, calling them \\"unprofessional voyeurs\\" and asserting his authority as the senior British official on the ground in southeastern France. Free Republic of Vercors While François Huet was attempting to create a conventional army from the maquis, journalist and De Gaulle supporter Yves Farge was organizing the politics of the Vercors resistance. On 3 July 1944 Farge and a committee proclaimed the founding of the Free Republic of Vercors, the first independent territory in France since the beginning of the German occupation in 1940. The Free Republic had its own flag, i.e., the French Republic tricolour featuring the Cross of Lorraine and the \\"V\\" for Vercors and Victory (both used as a signature by General Charles de Gaulle's Free French Forces), and its coat of arms, the French Alpine Chamois. It was a short-lived republic; it ceased to exist before the end of the month.The Vercors in History through a few dates – Vercors Memorial website Bastille Day B-17s dropping supplies to maquis, July 14, 1944. On 14 July, 72 American B-17's dropped by parachute 870 CLE Canisters containing weapons, including anti-tank bazookas, and supplies to the Maquis of Vercors. It was a daylight drop and the Germans quickly detected it and launched air strikes to bomb the canisters, the maquis attempting to recover them, and the village of Vassieux, destroying one-half of the 85 houses in the village. Working with the maquis to collect the canisters was a newly-arrived SOE courier, Christine Granville (Krystyna Skarbek), \\"World War II's most glamorous spy.\\"Garmen, Emma, \\"World War II's Most Glamorous Spy,\\" , accessed 3 Jan 2020 The large, daytime drop of weapons, instead of the usual smaller night drops, were criticized by the maquis leaders as igniting German worries that the Vercors would become a serious threat to their forces and lines of communications. The German response was to organize one of their largest anti-resistance military operations in France during World War II. Battle Gotha Go 242 glider in flight The road over Col de Tourniol on the western flank of the massif. The village of Vassieux. German Lt. General Karl Ludwig Pflaum was the commander of the German forces attacking the Vercors maquis. With eight to ten thousand soldiers, Pflaum established a cordon of soldiers around the massif to prevent the escape of maquis and on 21 July launched a full scale attack. German columns advanced south along a road from Saint-Nizier in the northeast and from the south along a road from the town of Die. Alpine troops crossed the formidable, but thinly defended, eastern ramparts of the massif. The preparations being made for these assaults were readily visible to the maquis; the surprise element in the offensive was the landing of 200 airborne soldiers by glider near the village of Vassieux in the rear of the maquis defense. The glider landings were supported by warplanes bombing and strafing maquis positions. By that first evening it was clear that the German assault was succeeding. The maquis commander Huet had a meeting of his leaders and they decided to continue to fight until defeat was inevitable and then disperse to the forest and mountains of the massif, anticipating that the Germans would soon withdraw. It was also decided that Huet's superior officer in the FFI, Henri Zeller who was present at the meeting, would escape the Vercors with SOE agents Cammaerts, Granville, and wireless operator Auguste Floiras to coordinate the resistance in other areas. The maquis sent a bitter message to the Free French authorities in Algiers and to the SOE in London telling them that they were \\"criminals and cowards\\" for not sending help. The last gasps of the organized resistance were on 23 July with the surviving maquis taking refuge in the forests or escaping to the lowlands surrounding the Vercors. The American team led by Hoppers and the SOE team led by Longe both escaped. Huet hid in the forests until 6 August when he attempted to rally his surviving forces and, reverting to guerilla tactics, on 8 August the maquis carried out several raids, claiming they killed 27 Germans. The long-expected allied landing in southern France took place on 15 August and the allied forces advanced rapidly northward, aided by the maquis. On 22 August the city of Grenoble was liberated from German control and maquis from the Vercors marched in the victory parade. Casualties among the maquis during the battle were heavy with estimates of 659 maquis fighters and 201 civilians killed. German losses were 65 killed and 18 missing. German order of battle According to the order of battle of 8 July 1944 from General Niehoff, Kommandant des Heeresgebietes Südfrankreich (military region of southern France), about operation Bettina against Maquis du Vercors, it appears that the Germans deployed nearly 10,000 soldiers and policemen under General Karl Pflaum:Bundesarchiv-Militärarchiv RW 35/47 Almost all the 157.

I./98, II./98, 99 and 100 from the Reserve-Gebirgsjäger-Regiment 1); 2 reserve infantry battalions (Btl. 179 and 199 from the Reserve-Grenadier-Regiment 157 – Btl. 217 remained in the southern Alps at Embrun); 2 reserve artillery batteries (from Res.Geb.Art.Abt. 79 out of the Reserve-Artillerie-Regiment 7).Georg Tessin, \\"Verbände und Truppen der deutschen Wehrmacht und Waffen-SS im Zweiten Weltkrieg 1939 – 1945\\" Other units: Kampfgruppe \\"Zabel\\" (1 infantry battalion from the 9. Panzer-Division and 1 Ost-Bataillon); 3 Ost-Bataillonen (Ostlegionen); about 200 Feldgendarmen; 1 security battalion (I./Sicherungs- Regiment 200); 1 police battalion (I./SS-Polizei-Regiment 19); about 400 paratroopers (special units from Fallschirm-Kampfgruppe SchäferGeoffrey J. Thomas and Barry Ketley, KG 200: The Luftwaffe’s Most Secret Unit, Hikoki Publications Ltd, Crowborough (East Sussex), 2003). According to the daily reports of OB West on 23 and 24 July 1944, forwarded by the Militärbefehlshaber in Frankreich, the following troops landed at Vassieux-en- Vercors on 21 and 23 July 1944:NARA T78 Roll 313 On 21 July 1944 about 200 men from Fallschirmjäger-Bewährungstruppe (probationary troops) forming the Fallschirm-Kampfgruppe \\"Schäfer\\", with several French volunteers (from the Sipo-SD of Lyons or from the 8th company of the 3rd regiment \\"Brandenburg\\"), were airborne in 22 DFS-230 gliders (each with 1 pilot and 9 soldiers) towed by bombers Dornier-17 out of I/Luftlandegeschwader 1, from Lyons-Bron to Vassieux-en-Vercors.Georg Schlaug, Die deutschen Lastensegler-Verbände 1937–1945, Motorbuch Verlag, 1985 According to Peter Lieb, two gliders crashed and eight of them landed a bit further on, so the first wave of assault consisted only of about a hundred soldiers.Peter Lieb, Vercors 1944. Resistance in the French Alps, Osprey, Oxford, 2012 Peter Lieb spécifies that the commander of the Sipo-SD of Lyon (KDS), SS-Obersturmbannführer (SS Lieutenant Colonel) Werner Knab, was also airborne on Vassieux on 21 July. Shot and wounded, he was evacuated in a Fieseler Fi 156 Storch on 24 July. He would have played an important part in the torture and the slaughter of the Maquisards of Vercors and the inhabitants of Vassieux. On 23 July 1944, 3 Go-242 gliders (each with 2 pilots and 21 soldiers, or weaponry and supplies) towed by Heinkel-111 bombers, and 20 DFS-230 gliders transported one Ost- Kompanie (Ostlegionen: Russian, Ukrainian and Caucasian volunteers) and a paratrooper platoon from Valence-Chabeuil to Vassieux. According to Peter Lieb, at least two DFS-230 and two Go-242 gliders landed a further on, only one Go-242 with weaponry and supplies landed on Vassieux, so the second wave of assault consisted only of about a hundred and fifty soldiers. Thomas and Ketley wrote that the Fallschirm-Kampfgruppe \\"Schäfer\\" was detached from Kampfgeschwader 200 on 8 June 1944. It was made up of volunteers out of Fallschirmjäger-Bewährungstruppe (probationary troops), mustered at Tangerhütte and trained for three months at Dedelstorf in order to launch an attack from gliders. Günther Gellermann says that the Fallschirm-Kampfgruppe \\"Schäfer\\" was under Luftflotte 3 command and no longer under Kampfgeschwader 200 command.Günther W. Gellermann, \\"Moskau ruft Heeresgruppe Mitte: Was nicht im Wehrmachtbericht stand - Die Einsätze des geheimen Kampfgeschwaders 200 im Zweiten Weltkrieg\\", Bernard & Graefe, Koblenz, 1988 In fiction The Maquis du Vercors is depicted and veterans act in Pierre Schoendoerffer's 2002 feature film Above the Clouds (Là-Haut), and in the third season of the British TV programme Wish Me Luck, which first aired in 1990.

Description Bates's swift is a small, slender swift with a deeply forked tail which is often held closed to form a point. It has a glossy black plumage with an indistinct pale patch on the throat. It is normally silent but makes a high-pitched trill near the nest. They are 14 cm in length. Distribution Bates's swift is found from Liberia and Guinea then patchily eastwards to Ghana, Nigeria and Cameroon, south to Gabon and the northern Congo. Its presence in Sierra Leone is unconfirmed, as are reports from the eastern democratic Republic of Congo. Habitat Bates's swift is a rainforest species and is found in areas close to cliffs and crags. Habits Bates's swift forages above the canopy of the rainforest using a fluttering flight, with short periods of gliding occasionally interrupting the rapid wing beats. It may be seen singly, or in small flocks and in mixed flocks with other swifts and hirundines. It nests solitarily in the old nests of hirundines and other swifts, mainly forest swallow and possibly mottled spinetail and lesser striped swallow. Breeding has been recorded in September to March in Gabon and egg laying has been noted in Cameroon in May and June. Taxonomy and naming Recent molecular studies have placed this species in a clade with white-rumped swift, horus swift, house swift and little swift.

It was previously considered conspecific with the smaller ashy- tailed swift, but Marín (1997) found that Sick's swift was closer to the chimney swift. It is a migratory species that breeds in central South America and overwinters in northern South America. The IUCN has listed it as being of \\"Least Concern\\". Description The upperparts dark smoky brown. The tail is ashy grey with dark shafts and protruding spines, The throat is grey, lower underparts dark brown, bill and legs black. Behaviour Breeding The nest, typically placed in a chimney or a hollow tree, is an open cup similar in construction to that of the chimney swift. Constructed almost entirely of one type of dry leaf stalks having a length of 5 cm. The structure of the nest lacks density and is transparent. Adhesive saliva is used on the place of the attachment of the nest and to a lesser degree on its front side. The nest does not have a rear wall, which is represented by the side of the tree. the breeding period of the Chaetura corresponds with the end of the dry season to the beginning of the rainy period. Theis reused until it falls down, on which occasion the same location is used to build a new nest. Clutch size is 3-5 eggs, the female incubates but both parents feed the young. Feeding Sick's swift feeds in flight on flying insects. It often flies low over roads or clearings in the morning or evening, rising high above the forest, often with other swifts, in the middle of the day. Distribution and habitat It breeds in south-eastern Brazil and adjacent parts of Argentina, Paraguay and Bolivia, but is believed to spend the Austral winter further north in the Amazon basin, northern South America and Panama. Its exact wintering range is, however, poorly known due to the highly complex matter of field identification of a number of very similar Chaetura swifts found in central and northern South America. In addition to the previously mentioned countries, there are records from Colombia, Venezuela, Suriname and French Guiana. It is generally common, but confirmed records outside its breeding range (where it is the only large Chaetura swift, and therefore relatively easy to identify) are infrequent. Its preferred habitat is lowland evergreen forest edge, secondary forest, open woodland and second-growth scrub but it can be seen flying over virtually any habitat during its annual migration. Status The population size for the Sick's swift has not been estimated but it is said to be common within its breeding range, which covers over , and less common in its wintering range. There is no evidence that the population is declining nor are there any particular threats to this bird apparent, so the IUCN has listed this species as being of \\"Least Concern\\".

The genus previously contained fewer species. Seven subspecies of the glossy swiftlet were promoted to species status based on a detailed analysis of the swiftlets in the genus Collocalia published in 2017.

Taxonomy It was formerly lumped with the island swiftlet (Aerodramus inquietus). Description The swiftlet is about 11 cm in length with a dark grey-brown head and upperparts. Its throat and upper breast are grey-white with the rest of the underparts darker grey. The tail has a shallow fork and the plumage lacks gloss. Distribution and habitat The swiftlet is found in Guam as well as in Saipan and Aguiguan in the Northern Mariana Islands, and is locally extinct on Rota and Tinian. It was also introduced successfully to Oahu in the Hawaiian Islands in the early 1960s, though the population there remains small. Its natural habitats are tropical moist lowland forest, mangrove forest and grassland. Behaviour In its natural range the swiftlet builds shallow nests high on the interior walls and ceilings of limestone caves, including sites in zones of complete darkness, in colonies of a few to several hundred birds. A single egg constitutes a clutch, but the birds may breed more than once a year. The swiftlets utter twittering and chirping sounds as well as the echolocation clicks used to navigate inside the nesting and roosting caves. Most birds in a colony leave their cave at dawn to forage, returning at sunset to roost. They are aerial feeders that capture small insects in flight over forest and other vegetation. Status and conservation The Mariana swiftlet is considered to be Endangered. The population on Guam declined because of predation by brown tree snakes and the use of agricultural pesticides, though it is believed to have subsequently increased to an estimated 900 individuals in 2006. The population on Saipan was estimated in 2005 to consist of about 5400 individuals, though this population is at risk if the brown tree snake becomes establishment on the island. The estimated size of the Aguiguan population is about 400. The single known breeding colony on Oahu was estimated in 1997 to contain a minimum of 17 breeding pairs. Proposed conservation measures include continued population monitoring and limiting cave disturbance, the prevention of the establishment of brown tree snakes in the Northern Marianas Islands, control of introduced mud dauber wasps and cockroaches where they damage nests, and the reintroduction of birds to Rota whence they were extirpated in the 1970s.

Like other members of the genus this species is able to echolocate, a trait it uses to navigate itself in the caves it breeds in. Like the rest of its genus it breeds in caves, constructing nests of vegetation such as ferns, rootlets and grasses, or lichens, held together with saliva.Tarburton, Michael K.

The peak of the breeding season is October through to December, but there are occupied nests through most of the year. The clutch size is a single egg for this species. The nestling period, between 57–74 days, is one of the longer chick raising periods of any swifts.

It is found on the Indonesia islands of Sumatra, Java and Bali. It is a woodland species and nests in caves. The Bornean swiftlet was considered a subspecies, but is now usually considered distinct. Taxonomy The cave swiftlet was described by the naturalists Thomas Horsfield and Frederic Moore in 1854 under the present binomial name Collocalia linchi. The specific epithet linchi is the Javanese word for a swiftlet. There are four recognised subspecies: HBW Alive * C. l. dedii Somadikarta, 1986 - Bali and Lombok * C. l. linchi Horsfield & Moore, F, 1854 - Bawean and Java * C. l. ripleyi Somadikarta, S, 1986 - Barisan Mountains, Sumatra * C. l. dodgei Richmond, 1905 - Mt Kinabalu (Sabah), in N Borneo. Description This bird is shiny blackish-brown above with a greenish gloss, including its rump; sometimes looks black and hooded. Chest black; belly to flanks pale grey with fine black speckles at margins. Wing tips are rounded; underwing is black. Tail black, rounded with shallow notch but lacking the white specks found in the very similar glossy swiftlet (Collocalia esculenta). A distinguishing feature between the two species is that the glossy swiftlet has a tuft of feathers on its hind toe but the cave swiftlet has a naked toe. It is in length. The call is a high-pitched \\"cheer-cheer\\". Distribution and habitat The cave swiftlet is native to Malaysia and Indonesia. It is found in the Sundaic region, in Java, Madura Island, Bawean, Kangean Island, Nusa Penida, Bali and Lombok, parts of Sumatra, and the western slopes of Mount Kinabalu on Sabah, Borneo. Evidence of it occurring in Malaysia rests on a single specimen in the British Museum labelled \\"Molacca\\". Its natural habitat is lowland and upland forest and open woodland. Behaviour The cave swiftlet is highly gregarious and flies with all the other species of swift that are sympatric with it. It often circles and flies through the branches of trees emerging through the canopy such as fruiting figs. It breeds in the lighter parts of caves, building a nest of stringy vegetation and cementing the materials to the rock with saliva. Two white, somewhat elongated eggs are laid.

Unable to finish her novel, Waverly turned to short stories, submitting several to Seventeen, all of which were quickly rejected. She earned a B.A. in English from Stonehill College, where she served as the editor of the school's literary magazine during her senior year. Shortly after her graduation she married her college sweetheart, and then embarked on a brief career as a school teacher. Waverly was a stay-at-home-mother while her son and daughter were young. When her children were teenagers she worked as a temporary secretary, giving her the opportunity to research different fields and careers. After plotting four romance novels, Waverly finally sold her fifth manuscript to Harlequin books. The novel was published in 1990 as part of the Harlequin Romance category line. Some of her subsequent novels have been published within the Harlequin Superromance line instead.

He was named after his direct ancestor Sir Charles Hobby who was knighted by Queen Anne in 1705. Biography Born in Milford, Connecticut on April 26, 1781, Pond was the son of Captain and Martha (Miles) Pond. Prepared by his pastor, he attended college beginning at age seventeen and graduated from Yale University in 1802. He studied law with Hon. Roger Minot Sherman, of Fairfield, for two years and admitted to the bar in Fairfield County. Instead of beginning practice, he took a long sea voyage for his health and it suited him so well that he took another. The result was he followed the sea for several years as an employee of his father's shipping business; first as a supercargo, then as captain. Regaining his former health he took up his residence on land again. He was married in 1809 to Catherine Dickinson and they had seven children. Career Pond served as an associate judge of New Haven County Court from 1818 to 1819, sheriff of New Haven from 1820 to 1834, and again as judge of New Haven County Court from 1836 to 1837. Pond was elected Lieutenant Governor of Connecticut in 1850, 1852, and 1853. On October 13, 1853, Governor Thomas H. Seymour resigned from office, and Pond, who was Lieutenant Governor at the time, assumed the duties of Governor. During his tenure, the U.S. Senate passed the Kansas-Nebraska Bill, which caused great controversy throughout the state. (The act made slavery legally possible in a vast new area and revived the bitter quarrel over the expansion of slavery, which had died down after the Compromise of 1850, hastening the start of the Civil War.) Pond did not seek reelection and left office, retiring from public service. Death and legacy The same month and year of the bombardment of Fort Sumter, Pond died on April 28, 1861 (age 80 years, 2 days). He is interred at Milford Cemetery, Milford, Connecticut. He is memorialized on the Milford Founding Fathers Memorial in Milford. References External links * National Governors Association biography *F.C.

He led several thousand men to protest against the high taxes which were imposed on the poor farmers and fishermen of Norway.  Biography  Jochum de Lange was a former sailor who settled down as a farmer on the island of Flatøy, Norway. He was said to be a charismatic man, who was married three times, and who easily gained other peoples trust. He was a visionary and a man of experience, but adventurous with a longing to return to the sea. Jochum de Lange would die in a Bergen prison. Strilekrigen In autumn 1762, the national government in Copenhagen established an extra per capita tax for every person over twelve years, which was later reduced to a charge per household. These extra taxes were intended to help pay loans from foreign governments and to support the price of the Danish-Norwegian currency at the stock market in Hamburg. Strilekrigen took place in Bergen on 18 April 1765, when about 2,000 common people from Nordhordland poured into Bergen to protest against the harsh action of the extra tax. The extra tax had hit the poor farmers and fishermen in rural areas around Bergen particularly hard. The protests, which became violent, were particularly directed at Ulrik Fredrik de Cicignon (1698–1772), the local sheriff (stiftamtmann) . Rebellions of this magnitude was unprecedented in the 18th century, and officials in Copenhagen were appalled. The authorities send an inquiry north consisting of top officials on a warship. The leaders of the rebellion were indicted by the general court and were convicted of disturbance of public order. The result was that a few farmers ended in prison for life after being pardoned from the death sentence. The extra tax was later abolished in Norway in 1772 but continued in force in Denmark. Ulrik Fredrik de Cicignon sought and received dismissal in May 1766. He moved to Sønderborg in the Duchy of Schleswig. Legacy Olav Flatøy, a businessman and writer from Flatøy, wrote a novel concerning life on Flatøy in the mid-18th century. It was called Anne Cathrine, and told the story of Jocum de Lange, his third wife and her struggles after his death. This novel was printed as a serial in Bergens Tidende in 1961. In 2013 the music festival Flatøy Rock introduced Jochum de Lange as the mascot and theme for the festival. This was done in an effort to raise awareness to the history and heritage of the people in Nordhordland.

Some types of aquaria such as reef aquariums and planted aquariums require specialized high intensity lighting to support photosynthetic life within the tank. Freshwater Aquarium with LED lighting Freshwater aquarium lighting is commonly provided by screw-in incandescent bulbs, fluorescent tubes and LED lamps. Incandescent lighting is becoming less popular because it uses much more energy and produces more heat than the other lighting types. Compact fluorescent lighting with a compatible screw-in base is frequently used as a direct replacement for incandescent bulbs. Freshwater planted aquariums require more specialized light sources. High-intensity compact fluorescent bulbs, high output fluorescent bulbs or metal halide lamps are often used over such aquariums to encourage plant growth. In addition to providing a much stronger light source, these light sources also offer a better spectrum for plant and algae growth than standard lighting. However, this metal halide lighting often uses more electricity and can produce excessive heat. Other newer sources for planted aquariums that use less electricity and produce less heat include the T2, T5, SHO, and LED. The LED aquarium light fixtures generally are the most efficient, although the T2, T5, and in particular the SHO, have their positive planted aquarium applications as well. Brackish Brackish aquarium lighting is similar to freshwater and planted tank lighting, depending on the species included. Brackish aquariums may also include infrared or UVB bulbs (or both types) for basking animals such as turtles. Marine Fish only In fish-only marine aquariums, lighting is intended only for illumination. Lighting is chosen primarily with aesthetic considerations for optimal viewing of the fish. The lighting is generally of much lower intensity than is used in reef aquariums to limit algae growth. Reef The lighting used for reef aquariums is the highest intensity of all aquarium types. Typical light sources types include LED, fluorescent, metal halide, and sometimes plasma lamps. Simple lighting setups use a single lamp or multiple lamps of a single type. More advanced setups can include several lamp types and can also include lamps of different colours. Lamp colour plays an important role in reef aquarium lighting for both aesthetic preference and to optimally sustain the photosynthetic life within the aquarium. Many corals require a deep blue or actinic spectrum of light to thrive. T5 High Output fluorescent bulbs which are thinner than traditional T8 bulbs and provide a much brighter, more powerful light are commonly used as are the older VHO (Very High Output) fluorescent tubes and compact fluorescent lighting. Another light source in reef aquariums is metal halide lighting. These high output lights closely recreate the shimmering effect of bright tropical sun over a patch of coral reef. Metal halide bulbs come in a variety of spectra from 5000k on up to 20,000k and allow for a variety of light-hungry corals to survive under them. Many aquarists will use metal halide bulbs in conjunction with either power compact fluorescents or T5 fluorescents since halide lighting does not have the overall balanced effect of other light types. While very useful to reef aquarium keepers, halide lighting also uses a lot of electricity (150-400 watts being common) and produces copious amounts of heat. Most reef keepers mount halide bulbs at least one foot above their tank and some, due to the lights' heat output have had to add chillers to keep aquarium water cool. Many light fixtures come as all-in-one units with light for both daylight hours and nighttime viewing. LED lamps of 3/4 to 2 watts can be implemented to come on at night, simulating the glow of the moon over the tank. All in one fixtures require large fans to cool the bulbs and achieve maximum light efficiency. LED lighting is also becoming more common for not only lunar lighting but also to simulate daylight conditions, LEDs have a higher initial cost than other lighting sources but utilize much less energy. They are also dimmable. LEDs produce a very narrow color spectrum that is limited to a narrow band of wavelengths. For this reason an array of different colored LEDs is required to be used in combination to simulate spectral coverage that is suitable for coral growth. Early adopters of pure LED based systems have reported that the limited color spectrum provided by LEDs may not produce optimal coral growth.

Its unusual geographic location was a result of glaciation during the previous Ice Age. It is known for its high steep sandstone cliffs along the river, its biodiversity and abundant Native American rock art. Fountain Bluff is named for the numerous natural springs within its hills. There is also a large spring called the \\"Fountain\\" on the north side of the hills. Fountain Bluff is sometimes called Big Hill by locals with the name \\"Fountain Bluff\\" referring to the sandstone cliffs themselves. Physical characteristics Fountain Bluff is located in western Jackson County between the Illinois towns of Gorham to the north and Grand Tower to the south, and across the river from Wittenberg, Missouri. Tower Rock, a major Mississippi River landmark, is also located nearby. Here, the Mississippi River is squeezed into a narrow channel between Fountain Bluff and the Missouri shore, where it forms bedrock rapids. During an 1864 survey the range from low to high water was determined to be . The 478 megawatt Grand Tower Energy Center is located next to the Mississippi River at the base of Fountain Bluff. The hill is part of the Shawnee National Forest with the exception of a small portion of private property. The hill is about long and up to wide, covering . The highest elevation on Fountain Bluff is near the north end, which is more than above the level of the Mississippi River valley. Illinois Route 3 follows an alignment along the eastern edge of Fountain Bluff; the Big Muddy River, a tributary of the Mississippi, flows a short distance to the east. A fire tower, open to the public, was long located on the summit and offered \\"a far- flung view of Illinois and Missouri, of the hills and the river, the fields, forests and farms of the vast bottom lands.\\" As of 1985, the tower was reported to have been dismantled. In the 1939 Illinois: A Descriptive and Historical Guide Fountain Bluff is described as a \\"freak formation... which juts from the level flood plain like a huge loaf on a table top.\\" The west and south sides of Fountain Bluff are flanked by sandstone cliffs high. The rest consists of wooded hills interspersed with large rock formations: \\"some sections are as smooth as polished ivory; others are rough and fissured. Large expanses are covered with lichens, moss and small-leaved vines.\\" The area is dotted with small streams, waterfalls and natural springs, and many caves and rock shelters are formed in the exposed sandstone. There are two named streams flowing from the summit: Trestle Hollow and Happy Hollow. Due to its geographic isolation (despite its relatively low topographic prominence, it can be considered a minor sky island), the Fountain Bluff has been described as a \\"refugium for an assemblage of uncommon plants and animals\\". The northern harebell (Campanula rotundifolia) has been recorded to grow here, far south of its normal range; it may have become established here during the Wisconsinian glaciations. Mohlenbrock (1975) recorded a total of 991 taxa of plants. The major plant communities on Fountain Bluff are found in floodplain woods/swamps, \\"limestone woods\\" (established on shallow soil over limestone), mesic woods, \\"hill prairies\\" at exposed summits, and cliff faces. Geology Although it is located east of the Mississippi River, Fountain Bluff was once part of the west bank of the Mississippi valley. During the Wisconsinian Ice Age period from 85,000–11,000 years ago, the Cordilleran Ice Sheet advanced over much of North America and blocked the main channel of the Mississippi River. Swollen with glacial meltwater, the Mississippi River was forced to rise and carve a new channel to the west. When the ice sheet retreated, Fountain Bluff was left as an isolated \\"island\\" in the middle of the valley. During periods of heavy glacial melt, Fountain Bluff would have been a true island surrounded with water on all sides. After the ice was gone, the Mississippi may have changed course multiple times to flow around the west or east sides of Fountain Bluff, although it is currently locked in the deeper western channel. The Big Muddy River flows through the original Mississippi valley to the east as an underfit stream. The west and south edges of Fountain Bluff consists of exposed rock bluffs created by erosion from the Mississippi River. The hills are composed of Upper Chesterian limestone overlaid by Lower Pennsylvanian (Caseyville Formation) sandstone. Sandstone comprises most of the exposed (visible) strata. A smaller sandstone formation known as the \\"Devil's Bake Oven\\", which includes a natural arch, is located downstream and was formed from the same rock and glacial action that created Fountain Bluff. Two fault zones, the Pomona to the north and the Rattlesnake Ferry to the south, cross the area. History Indigenous peoples Native Americans of the Mississippian culture inhabited the area between 850–1500 AD. Archaeologists believe that petroglyphs found at Fountain Bluff were carved sometime between 1000 and 1250 AD. Rock carvings at Fountain Bluff were mentioned as early as the late 19th century, though they did not come to widespread public attention until 1953, when a group of volunteers led by local archaeologist Irvin Peithmann trespassed on private property and cleared a trail to a rock shelter on the north end of Fountain Bluff where over 40 carvings were publicly discovered without the owner's knowledge or permission. It is believed that these carvings are related to ceremonial activities around the time of the spring equinox. Known as Painted Rock, the site has been damaged by Peithmann and vandalism since its discovery; however, most of the petroglyphs remain intact. These petroglyphs are on private property and are not open to the public. Another \\"solstitial observatory\\" petroglyph site has been found in Trestle Hollow on the west side of Fountain Bluff. After 1800 The Kaskaskia people lived in the area during the initial period of European settlement. On August 13, 1803 the Kaskaskia officially ceded their traditional lands to the US government and received a reservation at Sand Ridge, about northeast of Fountain Bluff. They lived here until 1832 when the federal government relocated them to reservations in Kansas. In the 1830s, white immigrants (many of German origin) began to settle in the Fountain Bluff area. During the 1870s, Fountain Bluff was considered as a site for a Mississippi River bridge due to the narrowness of the river channel in this area. In 1917 the Illinois Rivers and Lakes Commission proposed the construction of a canal, lock and dam connecting the Mississippi and Big Muddy Rivers at Fountain Bluff, mainly for the purpose of transporting coal from the Southern Illinois coal fields. The project would have cost $1 million ($ in dollars). Fountain Bluff forms a natural barrier to floodwaters of the Mississippi River and is part of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Degognia and Fountain Bluff Levee and Drainage District, which protects about of farmland from flooding. In the early 1900s, Fountain Bluff was a popular recreation area, \\"the best known and most visited picnic area in southern Illinois.\\" The now defunct Illinois Central Railroad ran weekend excursion trains from Chicago to Fountain Bluff. However, the area has declined in popularity over the years. Before and during the Great Depression, Jackson County saw a large decrease in population as rural citizens moved to urban areas. Today, Fountain Bluff is \\"virtually unknown to tourists.\\" During the Depression, the Civilian Conservation Corps established Camp Glenn (November 1933–April 1937) next to Fountain Bluff and was occupied by 174 men engaged in road and bridge building and other construction work. Fountain Bluff's abundant sandstone was quarried for use in many CCC projects, and a major rock crushing facility was established here. The fire lookout tower that for many years stood atop Fountain Bluff was built by CCC crews in 1933. By the 1960s, the tower and others in the region were functionally obsolete, their use having largely been superseded by aircraft. Several hiking trails still exist in the area today, including the one providing access to the petroglyphs.

He became the first American to win a motorcycling world championship when he won the Speedway World Championship in 1937 (defeating brother Cordy Milne into third place). Milne finished as runner-up in the World Championship in 1938.Bamford, R. & Shailes, G. (2002). A History of the World Speedway Championship. Stroud: Tempus Publishing. Early life Milne's family moved to Pasadena, California, while he was still young. By the early 1930s, Cordy Milne had started to earn some decent money in racing. Jack decided that if he and his brother raced and shared expenses, they could earn a living from the sport. Jack sold his service station and purchased a pair of Comerford-JAP Speedway racing machines from England. Career The Milne brothers were invited to England, where speedway was very popular. Cordy signed up to ride for the Hackney Wick Wolves,Fenn, C.(2003). Hackney Speedway, Friday at Eight. Stroud: Tempus Publishing. Jack for the New Cross Tamers.Jacobs, N. Out of the Frying Pan, They became celebrities, appearing on trading cards and being featured in advertisements for a variety of products. Milne won the London Riders' Championship in 1937 and 1939.

Jack Milne also won the 1937 Australian 3 Lap Championship as well as the 1937 New South Wales State Championship at the famous Sydney Showground Speedway. Milne reached the final of the Speedway World Championship three times, never finishing lower than tenth place and was in fifth place after the semi-finals in 1939 when World War II broke out and the final was never run. He returned to Pasadena with his brother and opened a bicycle shop with $4,000 from their racing earnings. The business grew to include a motorcycle dealership and later the Milnes expanded to a major car dealership in the Los Angeles area. Legacy After the war, the brothers helped revive American Speedway racing in Southern California including Costa Mesa Speedway which has been operating continuously since 1969 to this day, and Milne won his last two American National titles.

Synopsis  This skeleton was one of the most famous dinosaur skeletons ever discovered. Named diplodocus carnegii for Andrew Carnegie, the Scottish-American industrialist, it is arguably the first complete dinosaur ever seen by millions of people. The fossil was discovered and eventually acquired by a team from the Carnegie Museum of Natural History during an expedition to the badlands of Wyoming. Uncovered on July 4, 1899, team member Arthur Coggeshall joked that the fossil should be called \\"Star- Spangled Dinosaur\\" because of its July 4 \\"birthday\\". Andrew Carnegie's friends dubbed it \\"Dippy\\". The name has stuck ever since. The paleontologist John Bell Hatcher (1861-1904) oversaw the study of the fossil and its preparation for display. His illustration of the skeleton hung on a wall at Carnegie's Skibo Castle in Scotland. When in 1902 the English King Edward VII (1841-1910) visited, he asked if Carnegie could obtain another dinosaur like Dippy for him to place in the British Museum. It was a rare find, of course, but Carnegie offered the king a plaster copy, which was installed May 12, 1905 in London. The original bones, however, were not prepared and erected at the Carnegie in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania until 1907. Kaiser Wilhelm II and other European royalty followed suit and asked for Diplodocus carnegii copies for their national museums. During the next 25 years replicas were installed in Berlin, Germany; Paris, France; Vienna, Austria; Bologna, Italy; St. Petersburg, Russia; La Plata, Argentina; Madrid, Spain; and Mexico City, Mexico, making Dippy the first dinosaur specimen to be duplicated so frequently and internationally for viewing by the masses. For more than a century Dippy has remained the Carnegie Museum's most iconic specimen. In 1999, to pay tribute to the 100th anniversary of its discovery, the Carnegie created a life-size fiberglass sculpture of Diplodocus carnegii weighing 3,000 pounds, standing 22 feet, and measuring 84 feet in length. The sculpture is sited prominently on Schenley Plaza outside the museum, while the original fossil still stands indoors in Dinosaur Hall.  Reception  The book received reviews from publications including Isis, Rocks & Minerals, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, and Booklist.

A strong local tradition states that he was a priest of Rome appointed by Pope Sixtus II to evangelize this area at the request of the Christians resident in that part of Gaul. He preached at Marseilles, Lyon, and converted most of the inhabitants of Auxerre to Christianity. At Intaranum –present-day Entrains-sur-Nohain– Peregrine angered the governor after the saint appealed to the populace to abandon pagan idols; the inhabitants had been dedicating a new temple to Jupiter. The Martyrologium Hieronymianum states that he was tortured and beheaded at vicus Baiacus (Bouhy) (in present- day Nièvre) during the persecutions of Diocletian. His lector Jovinian, venerated as a saint, was also martyred with him. Other companions included Marsus, his priest; Corcodomus, his deacon; and Jovian his subdeacon. Veneration St. Peregrine is said to have founded Auxerre's cathedral, Saint-Etienne. Historians postulate that he was probably not a bishop at all, but rather a missionary who had been sent to the rural areas of this region. In the ninth century, churchmen of Auxerre made this local martyr the first bishop of their city. In the 7th century, some of his relics were translated from Bouhy to the Abbey of Saint-Denis. Pope Leo III ordered the construction of the church of San Pellegrino in Naumachia dedicated to Saint Peregrine in Rome near the Hospitale Francorum, which served French pilgrims. A street near the church was named San Pellegrino after the saint; it later gave its name to the Porta San Pellegrino. In 1645, while work was being carried out underneath the altar of the church of Bouhy, a human cranium was discovered. After an investigation, this was declared a relic of Peregrine and it was solemnly brought back to Auxerre.

It was formerly classified in the thrush family Turdidae but is now placed in the Old World flycatcher family Muscicapidae. It was described by the German biologist Eduard Friedrich Eversmann who is commemorated in the bird's English name. It is one of the larger redstarts, 15 to 16 cm long with a wingspan of 25.5 to 27 cm. The bill and legs are black. The male in breeding plumage has a black mask and grey crown and nape. The back and rump are rufous and the tail is also rufous apart from the darker central feathers. The wings are dark with white patches on the scapulars and primary-coverts. The underparts are mainly rufous with white on the belly and undertail-coverts. Non-breeding and first-winter males are similar but much duller and browner. Females are mostly grey-brown. They have a rufous tail with a dark centre, a pale eye-ring, two buff wingbars and buff edges to the tertials. The song is loud and lively. The birds also have a soft, croaking call and a whistling call. The tail is often flicked up and down. It breeds in the mountains of Central Asia and southern Siberia from the Tien Shan range to the Tarbagatay and Altay Mountains and near Lake Baikal. Some birds move downhill for the winter while others, especially in the north-east of the range, migrate longer distances. The wintering range extends from southern Iraq through Iran and Pakistan to the western Himalayas of Kashmir. A few birds reach eastern Arabia. It has occurred as a vagrant in the State of Israel and Turkey. It inhabits forest and woodland during the breeding season, reaching 5400 metres above sea-level. In winter it is seen in more open and arid habitats. Insects form the bulk of its diet during the breeding season but fruit and seeds are important in winter.

The forehead and crown of the head are black and this black extends down to the eye region and up to the pointed crest hanging down the nape. There is also black streaking on the neck and black patches on sides of the lower breast and abdomen. Leg colour has been reported as black, brownish-greyKenefick M. 2011.

In Argentina, breeding cocoi herons have been observed to have bright yellow bills with a red tinge at the base and dusky pink legs. In flight, its large wings make it a slow but sturdy and graceful flyer. The voice is a deep croak.Kushlan JA. 2011. The terminology of courtship, nesting, feeding and maintenance in herons. Heron Conservation. Overall, the cocoi heron is similar in appearance to the grey heron; but the former has slightly darker colouration and a longer neck and crest. In the juvenile, the underparts are ash grey and streaked with buff. The neck and upper body surface are pale brownish with some ash grey tinge on the neck. Compared to the adult, the crown is duller and the under-tail coverts have a dusky streaking. Juveniles also lack the long plumes and occipital crest typical of the adult. Despite the paler colouration, the downy chick already shows the contrast between the dark head and pale neck typical of the adult.Hancock J, Kushlan J. 2005. The Herons. Bird Families of the World.

The habitat comprises almost any body of water or wetland away from dense forest; including lake shores, swamps, rivers and estuaries. Gallery forest, grassland and beaches have also been reported to be suitable feeding grounds. Pastures appear to be disfavoured probably because these habitats harbour a large proportion of insects, which are less favoured as prey than fish and mammals. In the Falkland Islands, the habitat appears to comprise small streams. In one study in the Parana river, water with aquatic vegetation was found to be the most preferable, followed by open waters, with the lowest preference for beaches. This heron is found at elevations up to 2550 m above sea level.

In Colombia, chicks have also been observed being fed predominantly fish and less frequently with amphibians and crustaceans. Cocoi heron hunting in Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden The cocoi heron catches prey by striking its head into the water and thrusting its bill to stab downwards. It may also tilt its head downward above the water so that only its bill is immersed. During feeding, the head and neck move rapidly while the body remains immobile. Feeding is usually diurnal and solitary, especially in Argentina, although in Chile, it is considered to be a largely nocturnal feeder, with diurnal roosting taking place in trees overlooking the water. In Venezuela, it has also been seen foraging in large groups. Where feeding is diurnal, there appears to be a peak in feeding activity at noon and a reduction at dusk. The cocoi heron appears able to use alternative food sources by exploring foraging sites distant from its breeding colonies, since terrestrial rodents and reptiles and marine organisms have been found in the diet of individuals from freshwater colonies. Some colonies also reside near to estuarine coastland and individuals from these colonies are more reliant on marine prey. Foraging individuals often stay near to colonies and colony site choice has been found to be strongly linked to proximity to high-quality foraging habitats. The heron may also sometimes exploit dead whitemouth croaker discarded by recreational fisheries. Breeding Generation length in years has been estimated as 10.5 years, with a maximum longevity of 24.4 years. This heron is primarily non-migratory, but may move toward the equator during winter to seek warmer temperatures. The onset of the nesting season varies geographically. In Suriname, it begins in July; whereas it begins in August to November in Brazil and Argentina,Wildscreen 2017. Cocoi heron. http://arkive.org/cocoi-heron/ardea-cocoi/ . October in Uruguay and November in the Buenos Aires region. The cocoi heron nests colonially in trees. The large, deep nest is constructed from branches and sticks with grass, usually situated in trees. Near Buenos Aires, nests consisted of branches of Solanum glauca and dry thistles. They were roughly circular, 65 cm in diameter and very deep. In Chile, cocoi herons have been observed to construct their nests on weeping willow trees in standing water with rushes. The eggs are pale blue with paler speckles and some whitish traces. Egg dimensions from various clutches in South America lie in the range 62-69 x 45–48 mm. Eggs from one Argentinian clutch weighed 70-80 g. From one colony in Buenos Aires, incubation was estimated as 24–26 days. However, in one Chilean colony where eggs hatched in September (spring), incubation period was estimated as 27 days, ranging 26–29 days.Gonzalez-Acuna D, Figueroa RA, Gonzalez A, Barrientos C, Ardiles K, Moreno L. 2008. Biologia reproductiva de la garza cuca (Ardea cocoi) en el centro-sur de Chile. Ornitologia Neotropical 19: 485 – 493. Clutch size is 1 to 4 eggs. Juveniles may remain in the nest for up to 12 to 13 weeks, but most leave at 6 to 7 weeks. Threats Alongside human inference, one natural threat may be posed by southern crested caracara. In one colony in Buenos Aires, the young in a caracara nest hatched before that of the cocoi heron in a nearby nest and the former were reared largely on the heron chicks. Conservation The cocoi heron is classified by the IUCN as least concern because of its extensive geographical range, apparently increasing population trend and large population size. Individuals in some territories are affected by agrochemicals, environmental modification and human interference with nests and eggs; but these issues do not constitute damaging threats and therefore do not threaten the species with extinction.

They are primarily seen in the outer islands of the Seychelles, Madagascar, and on the east coast of Africa including Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. Being native to Madagascar, this species is often referred to as the Madagascar pond heron or Madagascar squacco heron. The population of this heron is estimated at 2,000–6,000 individuals, with only 1,300–4,000 being mature enough to mate.  Taxonomy  The Malagasy pond heron was first described in 1860 by German physician and ornithologist Gustav Hartlaub. His first sighting occurred on the east coast of Madagascar and as such the scientific name of Ardeola idae was formulated thereafter. Being a monotypic taxon, it does not include subspecies or smaller, infraspecific taxa.  Description  Malagasy pond herons grow to in height and anywhere from in weight. There is not a large variation in weight between the sexes as they are quite similar in bone body structure. feather, eye, and bill colour are determined by life stage (chick, juvenile, and adult) and reproductive status. The adults appearance can be split into the non-breeding plumage and the breeding stage. When the species is not breeding, the crown and the posterior are a colour mixture of buff and black with brown prominent over the other parts of the body. The bill is predominately green with a black tip whilst the iris is yellow. The flight feathers are clearly seen in flight and for the most part are white. The feathers on the lower mantle and upper scapulars are loosely structured and elongated. Moreover, the lower foreneck feathers are split into fine elongated tips which cover the upper breast. The primary difference of appearance in the breeding stage is the dominance of a snow white colour over the body a bill of a deep azure blue. When coming out of breeding, an intermediate plumage emerges on the back, and dense plumes sprouting on areas such as the neck and breast. Prior to adulthood, the Malagasy pond heron will possess a juvenile plumage just before leaving the nest, lasting a few weeks. The juvenile differs from the adult in having a dull orange bill and pale green eyes. The one distinguishing feature of the chick is its thick buff yellow down.  Vocalisation  As they often hide in trees and shrubs at the sight of a human disturbance, distinguishing calls between species is often difficult. The Malagasy pond heron possesses two calls: a flight call and a burr call. The flight call has a duration of 0.5 s and is used at 5 second intervals as a means to keep distances between other birds in flight. The burr call is used when rival herons approach the nest.  Distribution and habitat  The Malagasy pond heron is distributed throughout the east of Africa, in Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda and Zambia. They also range from the Seychelles to Madagascar although they are rare in the south of the latter. In Madagascar, they are mostly observed at Lake Alarobia and Tsimbazaza Park (both in Antananarivo), wetlands around Ampijoroa and at Berenty. As a result, their estimated area of occurrence is . They occupy a broad range of Madagascan habitats that include small grassy marshes, lakes, ponds, streams, and rice fields. Those that populate the Aldabra region are commonly located in mangroves, inland pools, and lagoon shores. In the east of Africa it can inhabit fresh water marshes and streams of elevation levels up to . They are believed to inhabit anywhere from 11 to 100 locations in Madagascar and East Africa.  Behaviour  One of the key behavioural habits of the Malagasy pond heron is its yearly migratory pattern. It migrates from Madagascar to the eastern mainland of Africa in May and journeys back to its breeding range in October. Those that have not matured into adult life remain in the non-breeding areas, as there is no benefit in travelling to the breeding zone. In terms of interaction, this species is very territorial and communication with other rival birds is limited. As such, they will remain at least apart if nesting or in flight due to their inconspicuous nature. One observation found two Malagasy pond herons fighting, grasping at each other's bills in the motion of flight. In Africa, instances such as this are scarce as there is rarely more than two on the same body of water. Nesting tends to be done along the coast and foraging for food is performed well inland, away from the nests. In fact, the closest that an individual heron will get to another apart from breeding is during roosting in their nests. Habitat degradation has resulted in closer roosting and has become integrated with other heron species such as cattle egrets and squacco herons.  Diet  There is very limited knowledge on the feeding habits of the Madagascan pond heron but it is thought to feed solely on fish, insects and small invertebrates. It may occasionally eat small reptiles such as skink and geckos. A small study of a single Malagasy heron in Madagascar showed a diet that included frogs, dragonflies, beetles and grasshoppers. Amphibians are for the most part absent on Aldabra and Mayotte, so feeding on frogs is rare in those locations.  Threats  The main threat for survival of this species is the continual loss of habitat due to the clearing, drainage, and conversion of their wetland environments to rice fields. Moreover, the exploitation of eggs and young is prevalent at many of the breeding sites poses generational problems. As a result, their population has declined dramatically over the last 50 years. However, a recently established resource management process labelled GELOSE has helped significantly decrease activity in this species habitat. An equally dangerous threat to their survival is competition with the squacco heron, which is spreading vigorously and seems to be more adaptable to man-made structures and icons that encroach on their habitat. This form of heron greatly outnumbers the Malagasy pond heron in Madagascar and appears to have increased while endemic species has declined. Although they are vastly outnumbered, the Malagasy pond heron is presumed to dominate in the interspecific interactions.  Breeding  The breeding of the Malagasy pond heron is colonial, meaning that a large congregation occurs at a particular location for mating. However, both colony size and location numbers have dwindled over the past thirty years. Colony size has dropped from 700 individuals to around 50 whilst breeding locations are limited to only a few colony sites. In Madagascar, colonies are located in phragmite reedbeds, typha, papyrus and Cyprus stands with coastal islands also being of extreme importance. Moreover, breeding in Madagascar has resulted in a mixed colony of heron species that include the black-crowned night heron, little egret, cattle egret, great egret, and the squacco heron. The largest colony of the Malagasy pond heron on record was around 500 pairs in Imerimanjaka Cyperus marsh, near Antananarivo. These 500 pairs were also mixed with 1,500 pairs of squacco herons, resulting in the largest breeding colony of African herons in 1940. Unfortunately, current day pairs usually never exceed 10. Like many other bird species, the Malagasy pond heron faces an abundance of predators and as such must nest in trees and bushes in hard-to-access ponds and marshes. The main predator of this heron include the various species of crocodile that inhabit the range and also snakes, should they grow large enough. To ward off ground threats, the breeding nests are built 1 to 4 metres above the ground. Should the population colony be mixed with other avian species, they will always occupy the higher nests. Breeding usually starts in the month of October and can extend through to March should the heron be able to lay two clutches. On the coral atoll of Aldabra, breeding increases markedly when the rains arrive during November and December. Whilst the Malagasy pond heron has a large range of habitat, it will only breed in Madagascar and the aforementioned Aldabra. In Madagascar, the area to the west near Antananarivo is the preferred breeding location whereas the nature conservation sites of Ile aux Aigrettes and Ile aux Cedres of Aldabra are used. Successful breeding usually results from appropriate courtship displays, which include features such as aerial chases, duets, and crest raising. The incubation period is similar across all the breeding ranges and lasts anywhere from 21–25 days. Normal young possess a green down which can be observed about 2 weeks after hatching, which is when they leave the nest for the first time.  Conservation status  The conservation status of the Malagasy pond heron has changed dramatically over the last 30 years. In 1988, this species was classified as near threatened according to IUCNs red list but changes to their habitat resulted in a move to the vulnerable category in 2000. Consequently, as a result of further population decline their status ever since 2004 has been endangered.

Identification This is a small dark species of heron with a dark grey head, back and breast contrasting with a rufous belly, wings and tail. When seen in flight the bright yellow legs and feet contrast with the dark feathers of the underside of the body. Juveniles are paler and browner, darkening as they mature.Sinclair, I. & Ryan P.(2003), A Comprehensive Illustrated Field Guide Birds of Africa South of the Sahara, Struik, Behaviour This is a skulking species which when hiding assumes a bittern-like posture but with its bill in a horizontal rather than vertical position. It usually prefers to hunt on the landward side of well vegetated wetlands and in the shallow water. It is a largely sedentary species, which may make partial migratory movements to follow rainy season inundations of flood-plains. Breeding occurs during the rainy season, or when flooding is at a peak where this occurs early in the dry season. It nests colonially in mixed colonies, typically in small groups of 6-30 pairs, although at Lake Bangwelu in Zambia, groups of 60-80 pairs have been recorded. Rufous-bellied herons feed during the day but will sometimes forage at night, normally they hunt alone or in small flocks of no more than five individuals, although aggregations of over 120 have been recorded. It prefers to roost in trees.Brown, L.H., Urban, E.K, Newman K.

Negative reactions, called inamyloid or nonamyloid, are for structures that remain pale yellow-brown or clear. A reaction producing a deep reddish to reddish-brown staining is either termed a dextrinoid reaction (pseudoamyloid is a synonym) or a hemiamyloid reaction.

Taxonomy The German naturalist Johann Wagler described the white-backed night heron as Ardea leuconotus in 1827. Today the IOC World Bird List places it in the genus Gorsachius, while BirdLife International and the Handbook of the Birds of the World place it in Calherodius. Its name derives from a patch of white feathers that form a triangle on its back. Description The white-backed night heron is in length with a black head and a short crest, or prominent feather display on the top of its head. The heron has large red eyes with white-ringed markings around them, and the lores, or the region behind the eye, are a pale yellow hue. The throat feathers are white, whereas the neck and breast are rufous, or a reddish-brown hue. There is a notable white triangular patch along the back formed by the white scapulars, or small feathers, on the shoulder of the bird. The belly feathers are a whitish-brown and the legs are yellow. An immature heron can be identified by its streaked breast and the white spots on the upper-wing coverts. Chicks are covered with olive-brown down. Distribution and habitat The white-backed night heron is located throughout central and southern Africa, with a range estimated at . Its primary habitat is dense forests with neighboring waterways, particularly streams, lakes, mangroves and marshes. Behavior and ecology The white- backed night heron can be found living individually or in pairs. Nocturnal by nature, they roost in the dense vegetation of marshes and forests during the daylight hours, often nesting high within the trees. Their nests are well- hidden, usually built in vegetation near water and sometimes in reedbeds, mangroves, rocks and caves. The nest is built resembling a platform of sticks or reeds, wide. They usually breed during the rainy season or early in the dry season. There are two to three greenish-white eggs in a clutch, and incubation lasts roughly 24 to 26 days. The chicks leave the nest after six to seven weeks. The white-backed night heron seems to be sedentary, but it has been observed in some circumstances to have migrated to locations with heavy rain. White-backed night herons are known foragers, meaning they search for food primarily along waterways. They have been observed to eat fish, amphibians, mollusks and insects. Though usually quiet, they let out a loud kroak call when alarmed and a taash call when disturbed. Status The population of the white-backed night heron is believed to be stable because it does not appear to undergo significant population declines or experience any notable threats. Due to these factors and its large range, the IUCN Red List has assessed the species to be of least concern. The species is currently experiencing a small number of threats, including habitat loss in southern Africa and hunting in Nigeria, where they are used for traditional medicine.

It is found in southern China and northern Vietnam. It is threatened by habitat loss and habitat fragmentation. Taxonomy The white- eared night heron was collected in Hainan by John Whitehead. It was described as Nycticorax magnifica by William Robert Ogilvie-Grant in 1899. The species is monotypic. Distribution and habitat This heron is found in southern China and northern Vietnam. Its range size is estimated at . By 2001, the species had only been recorded from about 20 localities; in the ten years from 2001 to 2011, surveys discovered it in more than 30 localities, making its known range much larger. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical forests and rivers. It has also been found in human-modified habitats. Description The length is . The male is mostly blackish-brown. The neck- sides are chestnut. The lores are yellow, and the beak is black. The eyes are yellow-orange. The head and nape are blackish. The postocular stripes and throat are white. The underparts are brown, with white streaks. The tarsi are green. The female is similar to the male, but its head and neck are less distinctly patterned. The female also has whitish streaks on its back and wings. The juvenile is similar to the female, but has a browner plumage and buff spots. Behaviour and ecology Like other night herons, this species is mostly nocturnal. It feeds on fish, shrimps and invertebrates. Its territorial call is a deep, raspy whoaa, lasting about 0.3 seconds and repeated every 5–15 seconds. Breeding has been recorded in both Vietnam and China. The clutch size is 3–5 eggs. In China, hatching has been observed in May, with an incubation period of about 25 days. In Vietnam, fledging has been observed in late April. Breeding seems to occur earlier in Vietnam than in China. The nest is in the shape of a circular tray. A study found that fledging occurred more than two months after hatching, longer than most other species of heron. Status and conservation The IUCN Red List has listed the white-eared night heron as an endangered species because its population is small, fragmented and declining. In the 1990s, the species was considered very rare and listed as a critically endangered species. It was downlisted to an endangered species in 2000. Its population is estimated at 250–999 mature individuals and 350–1500 total individuals. It is threatened by deforestation, hunting, overfishing and water pollution. It has been discovered in many new localities, but the population is probably declining because of the threats. The species is listed as a Class II protected species in China. It occurs in protected areas in China and Vietnam, such as the and Ba Be National Park.

It was endemic to New Zealand and was last recorded alive in the 1890s. Common names for this species include New Zealand little bittern, spotted heron, and kaoriki (Maori). The scientific species name also has numerous junior synonyms. Taxonomy The species has sometimes been regarded as a subspecies of little bittern (Ixobrychus minutus), or conspecific with the black-backed bittern (Ixobrychus dubius) of Australia and old Guinea, though it was first described by Alexander Callender Purdie in 1871 as Ardeola novaezelandiae. In 1980, New Zealand palaeontologist Peter L. Horn found subfossil bones of a bittern from Lake Poukawa, which he named Dupetor flavicollis. In 1991, Philip Millener identified Horn's material as remains of the New Zealand bittern. Description Although a small bittern, the species was larger (length about 14.75 inches (38 cm)) than the little bittern (25–36 cm). Few specimens are known, and of these doubt exists even about the sex of some, making published descriptions unreliable. Differences from the little bittern include a larger buff patch on the upper wing, black upper parts streaked light brown, under parts streaked dark brown and rufous-buff. Distribution and habitat In recent times, the bird is only known with certainty to have inhabited the South Island of New Zealand, with most records from Westland. Although subfossil remains have been found in the North Island, reports of living birds may have been of misidentified Australasian bitterns. The first scientific specimen was reportedly obtained at Tauranga in the North Island by a Reverend Mr Stack in 1836, but is now untraceable. The holotype specimen in the Museum of New Zealand was taken from the head of Lake Wakatipu in Otago. The recorded habitat for the species includes the wooded margins of saline lagoons and creeks. Behaviour Walter Buller quotes a Mr Docherty, who was familiar with the bird in Westland: > They are to be found on the salt-water lagoons on the seashore, always > hugging the timbered side of the same. I have seen them in two positions, > viz.:— standing on the bank of the lagoon, with their heads bent forward, > studiously watching the water; at other times I have seen them standing > straight up, almost perpendicular; I should say this is the proper position > for the bird to be placed in when stuffed. When speaking of lagoons as the > places where they are to be found, I may mention that I caught one about two > miles in the bush, on the bank of a creek; but the creek led to a lagoon. > They live on small fishes or the roots of reeds; I should say the latter, > because at the very place where I caught one I observed the reeds turned up > and the roots gone. They are very solitary, and always found alone, and they > stand for hours in one place. I heard a person say that he had opened one > and found a large egg in it. They breed on the ground in very obscure > places; I never heard their cry. Feeding The bittern is recorded as eating mudfish and worms in captivity, when given in water. Voice Two calls were recorded by Buller, a \\"peculiar snapping cry\\" as an alarm call, and a \\"cry not unlike that of a kingfisher, though not so loud\\".

Systematics and evolutionary relationships among the herons (Ardeidae). Museum of Zoology, University of Michigan. Taxonomy The capped heron was described by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in 1780 in his Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux from a specimen collected in Cayenne, French Guiana. The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by François-Nicolas Martinet in the Planches Enluminées D'Histoire Naturelle which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon's text. Neither the plate caption nor Buffon's description included a scientific name but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name Ardea pileata in his catalogue of the Planches Enluminées. The capped heron is now the only species placed in the genus Pilherodius that was erected by the German naturalist Ludwig Reichenbach in 1853. The genus name combines the Ancient Greek πιλος pilos \\"cap\\" and ερωδιος erōdios meaning \\"heron\\". The specific epithet pileatus is Latin for \\"capped\\". There is little known about the relationship of P. pileatus with the other species of the family Ardeidae, because of its lack of inclusion in genetic studies.Sheldon, F. H., Jones, C. E., & McCracken, K. G. (2000). Relative patterns and rates of evolution in heron nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. Molecular Biology and Evolution, 17(3), 437-450.Sheldon, F. H., & Slikas, B. (1997).

With the little information available it is believed that its closest living relative is the whistling heron (Syrigma sibilatrix).  Description  This species is very distinct from other herons, being the only one with a blue beak and face, and a black crown. The belly, chest, and neck are covered with yellowish-white or light-cream feathers. The wings and back are covered with white feathers. Three to four white long feathers extend from the black crown.Wetmore, A., Pasquier, R. F., & Olson, S. L. (1965).

Although there are no migrations registered to this species and it is believed that is sedentary, there may be seasonal movements in Darien, Panama.Hancock, J., & Kushlan, J. A. (2010). The herons handbook. A&C; Black.  Habitat  The capped heron normally inhabits swamps and ditches in wet grasslands or rainforests. Sometimes it can venture into deeper ponds and rivers. They prefer to forage on the shore or in floating vegetation,Kushlan, J. A., Hancock, J. A., Pinowski, J., & Pinowska, B. (1982). Behavior of Whistling and Capped Herons in the seasonal savannas of Venezuela and Argentina. Condor, 255-260. but have also been observed in trenches of coffee plantations and flooded rice fields.Haverschmidt, F. (1952). More bird weights from Surinam. The Wilson Bulletin, 234-241.  Feeding  Capped herons hunt mainly for fish, but also aquatic insects and larvae, tadpoles, and frogs. Fish taken as prey tend to be between 1 and 5 cm long. The insects are hunted in the nearby vegetation along the river or pond, and the fish in the shallow waters. In a typical hunting sequence the heron will stand erectly searching for potential prey; after locating it they will crouch slowly and extend their neck; finally they will introduce their beak into the water at a great speed to catch the prey. The frequency of success observed is 23%. They can also use the same sequence while walking in the shallows. They usually walk slowly, covering the same area repeatedly pausing for a few seconds, then slowly moving one foot to take a new step. There are reports of individuals doing aerial hunting, peaking, gleaning, foot paddling, dipping, swimming feeding, and bill-vibrating. Capped herons move frequently between feeding sites, sometimes flying up to 100m. They may be crepuscular, but have been observed foraging during broad daylight, unlike the night-herons.Haverschmidt, F. (1958). The feeding habits of the Capped Heron (Pilherodius pileatus). The Auk, 75(2), 214-214. They usually hunt solitarily.Ogden, J. C., & Thomas, B. T. (1985). A colonial wading bird survey in the Central Llanos of Venezuela. Colonial Waterbirds, 23-31.  Behaviour   Territoriality  Capped herons are strongly territorial; the same bird may be seen at a foraging site for weeks at a time.Heckman, C. W. (2013). The Pantanal of Poconé: biota and ecology in the northern section of the world’s largest pristine wetland (Vol. 77). Springer Science & Business Media. One capped heron was seen chasing another away from a foraging site, until the other bird settled high in a tree.  Interspecific and intraspecific behaviour  The capped heron is normally solitary, although there are cases where they have been found in couples or groups. Birds may be seen with other species such as snowy egrets (Egretta thula) and scarlet ibis (Eudocimus ruber), however other studies have found that they avoid large mixed-species flocks, appearing in fewer than 1% of 145 observed feeding aggregations. Capped herons appear to be submissive to great egrets (Ardea alba), but dominant to snowy egrets (Egretta thula) and striated herons (Butorides striatus).  Reproduction  There is very little known about the reproduction of this species. Captive breeding in Miami, USA indicates that a female may lay 2-4 dull white eggs, incubation lasts 26–27 days, and that the chick has white down.Martinez-Vilalta, A., & Motis, A. (1992). Family Ardeidae (Herons). Handbook of the Birds of the World, 1, 376-429. However, these captive individuals failed to have any young survive, possibly due to a deficient diet or abnormal behavior in the adults. Based on birds with a similar biology, it is likely that they maintain family groups and care for young even after the young have reached the fledgling stage. There may be a two-cycle breeding pattern, with northern and southern populations breeding at different times of the year.  Conservation  This species has an extremely large range, and hence does not approach the thresholds for a Vulnerable rating under the range-size criterion. The population size has not been quantified, and the trend is not known, but it is not believed to approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size or trend criteria. For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern. Nevertheless, it occurs in very low densities and is considered \\"rare\\" in Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, and Panama.Hilty, S. L., & Brown, B. (1986). A guide to the birds of Colombia. Princeton University Press. The capped heron appears to be adaptable and may be expanding its use of man-made habitats. People have found some individuals in pools along the Transamazonian Highway Brasil.Sick, H. (1993). Birds in Brazil. Princeton Univ. Press, Princeton, New Jersey. However, given that it is mainly a riverine forest species, the loss of this habitat due to logging and conversion of forest to pasture might pose long-term threats.

It is present in southern Central America and parts of northern and central South America, where its natural habitat is rivers. In 1988 the fasciated tiger heron was categorized by the IUCN as Near Threatened but as of 2004 they have been recategorized as Least Concern. Taxonomy First described as Ardea fasciata by George Such in 1825 from a specimen collected in Serro do Imbé, Brazil, the fasciated tiger heron is now one of three species assigned to the genus Tigrisoma. In the past, it has sometimes been considered as a subspecies of the rufescent tiger heron. It has three subspecies: * T. f. fasciatum, described by Such in 1825, is found in extreme northeastern Argentina and southeastern Brazil. * T. f. pallescens, described by Claes C. Olrog in 1950, is found in northwestern Argentina. * T. f. salmoni, described by Philip Lutley Sclater and Osbert Salvin in 1875, is the most widespread of the subspecies, found on the Caribbean slope in Costa Rica and Panama, east and west of the Andes in Colombia, south through eastern Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia, and in northern Venezuela. The genus name Tigrisoma is a combination of the Greek words tigris, meaning \\"tiger\\" and somā, meaning \\"body\\". The species name fasciatum is a late Latin word meaning \\"banded\\". Both the scientific name and the common names refer to the fine barring on the upperparts of both adult and immature birds. Description Tigrisoma fasciatum illustrated by Joseph Smit At in length, the fasciated tiger heron is the smallest of the three tiger herons. The adult's crown is black, and the sides of its face are slaty gray. Its neck and upperparts are black, with widely spaced, fine, pale buff stripes. Its abdomen is grayish-cinnamon to warm brown, and its flanks are gray. Its beak, which is shorter and stouter than those of other tiger herons, is black above and yellowish-green below, with a slightly arched culmen. Its irides are yellow. Range and habitat The fasciated tiger heron is typically found along fast-moving streams. The fasciated tiger heron is found primarily in foothills, along rocky, quickly- moving streams. Its range extends from Costa Rica through northwestern Argentina, southeastern Brazil, and Guyana; it has been recorded as a vagrant in Nicaragua. Although it occurs from sea level to , it is generally found at higher elevations than the rufescent tiger heron where the two species occur together. Behavior The fasciated tiger heron is typically solitary, though multiple birds may gather at intervals of several hundred yards (meters) in favored fishing areas. Food and feeding It hunts along rivers, standing on the shore or on rocks in the watercourse with its neck partly extended. Its prey is primarily fish, which it catches by stabbing with its beak, though it also takes large insects. Breeding It builds a platform nest of sticks and lianas. Voice Nothing is known about the vocalizations of this species. Conservation status and threats When the International Union for the Conservation of Nature released its first listing of the conservation status of the world's species in 1988, the fasciated tiger heron was included as a near threatened species. The bird held that ranking until the 2000 list, when its status was changed to least concern. The estimates of its population are quite low: , some are thought to be mature adults. Its population trend is unknown, due in part to the poor quality of data regarding its numbers, and in part to uncertainty surrounding the impact that habitat modifications might have on the species. However, its range is considerable, spanning foothill regions in southern Central America and much of western South America, with isolated lowland populations in Guyana and eastern South America. In human culture There is some evidence that the fasciated tiger heron served as a food item for indigenous peoples in Panama (and possibly elsewhere) in the past. Remains possibly from this species have been found at multiple archeological sites around Panama's Parita Bay. In recent years, it has become a target of the pet trade, with both adults and juveniles being collected from the wild.

Personal life Despite being romantically linked to Syed Noor, it was not officially revealed that whether she has married him or not. In 2007, during a press conference, Saima publicly stated that she married Syed Noor in July 2005, during the making of their mutual film Majajan. In 2018, some media publications and online websites reported that Syed Noor has divorced Saima and the two are living separately. However, the couple denied these rumours and released a short clip on social media stating that they are happily married and will never separate.  In the media  Saima was one of the most popular and leading film actresses of Pakistan during 1990s and early 2000s. In 2017, The Express Tribune published an article on the topic of lack of new heroines in revival of Lollywood, in which Saima was cited as being lucky for the industry as she belongs to Southern Punjab. Film critic Omair Alavi from The News International praised her acting credibility and wrote that, \\"You can see why directors have continued to cast her over the years\\". In 2010, BBC News dubbed her as the \\"reigning queen of Pakistan's silver screen\\" and noted that she is \\"now one of the biggest names in the industry\\". After the decline of Pakistani film industry, Saima made her television debut and went on to become one of the highest-paid actresses of television medium along with actress Resham who was her contemporary from the 1990s.

In 1995 he became the first known Romanian explorer to reach the North Pole. Biography Negoiță was born on September 27, 1947 in the commune of Sascut in Bacău County, Romania. His parents were both teachers, and their home library included many old books on travel. From a young age, he was fascinated by descriptions of expeditions in the most difficult-to- traverse regions of the globe. Negoiță attended the Industrial Chemistry College of Iaşi, graduating as a chemical engineer. He was also interested in engineering, trying to modify large installations. He later transferred to a design and research institute in Bucharest. Negoiță died on March 23, 2011.The first Romanian who reached North Pole has died Speleological science  Negoiţă had a passion for ethnology, and was most interested in the equatorial forests, the Amazon Rainforest and New Guinea. In his free time, he studied a group of pygmies from Equatorial Africa. He also corresponded with a Catholic institute in Paris that sent him needed literature, but it was impossible for Negoiţă do field research. He found refuge in a field that he felt he could improve on in his country: speleological science. He was 33 when he learned about alpine speleology. His major field of interest was vertical caves, which with depths of 200-300 meters were not well researched. His passion for speleology later evolved into an interest in ice caves. He obtained what he considered to be the best speleology equipment, brought in from Czechoslovakia, and started to embark on a more coherent project than solitary hobby speleology. In 1987 he founded the first Romanian Institute of Polar Research, but it took three years to obtain the funding he needed. Arctic expeditions Negoiţă organized several Romanian expeditions in the Arctic: in Greenland, the northern areas of Canada, and Spitsbergen island in the (Svalbard) archipelago. He assembled teams of experts including geographers, geologists, engineers, doctors and biologists. These teams may have been the first Romanian teams to participate in cross-border expeditions. In his first expedition, however, five Romanians were lost in a helicopter crash. He also did some exploration on his own in Greenland and the Spitsbergen (Svalbard) archipelago, travelling approximately on skis. Negoiţă established contact with Danish, Norwegian, Canadian and Russian researchers, wanting to obtain information on other countries' work so that his Romanian team would be conducting original research. In 1994 he established the Romanian Institute of Polar Research as a private institution, intending to gather scientists from different fields who had a passion for polar exploration. He obtained funding for the institute's research projects from private sponsors, the Romanian government and European sources. After 1995 he returned to heading Romanian polar expeditions. Negoiţă trained for more than a year to make an expedition to the North Pole on skis during a Russian \\"last degree\\" research expedition. This training improved his physical condition to the point that he was able to ski for hundreds of kilometers, resist the cold and pull a sled that weighed . He trained eight hours a day pulling two tires to simulate the sled he would take to the North Pole. On April 21, 1995, Negoiţă became the first known Romanian explorer to reach the North Pole on skis during the Russian expedition. Antarctic expeditions After the North Pole expedition Negoiţă turned his attention to Antarctica. > Antarctica is the only harsh environment on the planet. Here we find the > driest atmosphere on the planet, this provide high quality astronomical > studies, atmospheres studies, research regarding climate changes, magnetism > research.

In December 2000 Romanian President Emil Constantinescu awarded Negoiţă the Star of Romania Medal - degree of officer. Founder of the first Romanian research station in Antarctica Negoiţă’s began the groundwork for building a Romanian exploration station in Antarctica in 1997, when he began to publish research essays at the Antarctic Treaty, of which Romania became a member in 1971. Map showing \\"Law-Racovita Station\\" on Antarctica's Larsemann Hills In 2000 Negoiţă gave the opening speech at the Antarctic Treaty meeting in London, before representatives of 43 countries. The goal of the meeting was to regulate naval rules in the Antarctic Seas, and the main arguments centred on the Romanian, American and British essays. Negoiţă presented the study “Directions concerning maritime Antarctic transport and environment pollution”. At the 2005 Antarctic Treaty meeting in Stockholm, Sweden, an agreement was signed with Australia that gave the Romanian Antarctic Foundation one of Australian's research bases on the Antarctic east coast. > After more than 100 years, I brought Racoviţă back in Antarctic regions. The > greatest achievement of my career was when I took from the base from the > Australians. I got so emotional, that I couldn’t even sign.Gândul, 12 august > 2005 - Cercetătorul Teodor Negoiţă pleacă spre unica baza românească din > Antarctica Planning to reopen the station in Antarctica, Negoiţă made his 13th polar expedition, spending 2-1/2 months in Antarctica. His exploration team included two women, a biologist and a biochemist, who were the first Romanian women to visit Antarctica. In addition to reopening the station, the expedition's purpose was to obtain ground samples, sediments and micro-organisms. On January 13, 2006, the Law-Racovita Station was re-opened, becoming Romania's first research and exploration station in Antarctica. The base was named after the first Australian researcher that explored east Antarctica, Phillip Law, and the first biologist that studied living in Antarctica, Emil Racovita. It was founded in 1989 by the Australian Government. \\"It is a first time in the Romanian Antarctic research, the country that signed the 1971 Antarctic Treaty which gives us the right to use the far south of Antarctica, in peaceful purposes. It is much easier for a country with a global position like Romania to reopen an older base than building a new one,\\" Negoiţă said at the opening of the station.Australia oferă României o bază de cercetare în Antarctica The yearly travel and maintenance for Romania as a result of the station are estimated at about $20,000US. The station is in the Princess Elisabeth region near the Larsemann Hills of East Antarctica, 2 km from the Russian and Chinese stations. The Romanian expedition cooperates closely with the researchers of these countries, exchanging information. The region is rocky, not icy, and offers numerous access points to the Antarctic icecap. The Romanian research team intends to do bioprospecting, ecological and weather forecasting, measurement of seismic and geomagnetic activity and gathering of data regarding radio communication interference. The station is built from anti- corrosive and thermo-isolating materials, and it consists of a laboratory, a radio station, five bedrooms and a fuel depot. Future plans Of the 13 polar expeditions he participated in, eight were led and organized by Negoiţă. Negoiţă expressed desires to do research on the Larsemann hills by gathering samples from the soil and lakes and carrying out medical tests, pollution studies and climate change surveys. He was also interested in gathering micro- organisms and meteorite samples from the ice. Negoiţă was disappointed, however, that he had trouble funding Antarctic expeditions. The total expedition cost for three researchers to mobilise for three months could be 25,000 euro. He said, \\"I started to cry on my own in the middle of the frozen ice land – thinking of the luck the Chinese and Russian researchers were having. From the point of view of the attention that we are given from the state, we are behind even Bulgarians. They get 300,000 dollars per each year from the Bulgarian Minister of Foreign Affairs.\\" Most European countries, including the former communist countries Russia, Ukraine and Bulgaria, have research institutes funded by a local academic institution and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Romania has no government institute for polar exploration, only the private Romanian Institute of Polar Research, which has a staff of just 10 researchers. For this reason, the Romanian Academy refused to fund the institute, although Negoiţă claimed that there were twenty researchers available in the country. Published papers Negoiţă published more than 28 scientific papers. To promote his research he used a style that was meant to appeal to the Romanian people rather than just scientists. His book Science on ice: With Chinese people in Antarctica (2005), was based on the journal he kept for 130 days in the winter of 2002-2003 during the 19th Chinese expedition to Antarctica. Honours and awards Negoiţă was appointed an officer in the Order of the Star of Romania in December 2000. In 2008 he was promoted to the rank of Commander in that Order.

It is found in wetlands from Central America through much of South America. Juvenile - Sacha Lodge - Ecuador T. l. lineatum, young adult, Panama Taxonomy The rufescent tiger heron was described by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in 1780 in his Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux from a specimen collected in Cayenne, French Guiana. The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by François- Nicolas Martinet in the Planches Enluminées D'Histoire Naturelle which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon's text. Neither the plate caption nor Buffon's description included a scientific name but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name Ardea lineata in his catalogue of the Planches Enluminées. The rufescent tiger heron is now placed in the genus Tigrisoma that was erected by the English naturalist William Swainson in 1827. The genus name Tigrisoma combines the Ancient Greek tigris, meaning \\"tiger\\" and somā, meaning \\"body\\"; the specific epithet lineatum is from the Latin lineatus meaning \\"marked with lines\\". Two subspecies are recognised: * T. l. lineatum (Boddaert, 1783) – Honduras south to northeast Bolivia and Amazonian Brazil * T. l. marmoratum (Vieillot, 1817) – southeast Bolivia to south Brazil and north Argentina Description The rufescent tiger heron is a medium-sized heron, measuring in length, with a mass between . The sexes are similarly plumaged. The adult's head, neck and chest are dark rufous, with a white stripe down the center of the foreneck. The remainder of its upperparts are brownish with fine black vermiculations, its belly and vent are buffy-brown, and its flanks are barred black and white. Its tail is black, narrowly barred with white. Its stout bill is yellowish to dusky, and its legs are dull green. Its irides, loral skin and orbital ring are bright yellow. Unlike other tiger herons, it has no powder down feathers on its back. The juvenile bird is rusty-buff overall, coarsely barred with black; the buff and black banding on its wings is especially pronounced. Its throat, central chest and belly are white. It takes some five years to acquire adult plumage. Similar species The adult rufescent tiger heron is relatively easy to distinguish from fasciated and bare-throated tiger herons, as it is rufous (rather than primarily gray) on the head and neck. Young birds, however, are much more difficult to identify. Distribution and habitat The rufescent tiger heron is found in wetlands from Central America through much of South America. It generally occurs below , though it has been recorded as high as in Colombia. Behavior It is largely crepuscular and generally solitary. Food and feeding As might be expected of a species that spends most of its time by the water, much of the rufescent tiger heron's diet is aquatic-based, including fish, crustaceans, water beetles and dragonfly larvae. It also takes adult dragonflies and grasshoppers. It typically hunts alone, standing hunched in shallow pools or wet areas of forest while it waits for prey. Voice The rufescent tiger heron's main call is a low-pitched paired hoot, often given at night. It also gives a fast series of sharp wok notes, which decrease in volume and speed, and a prolonged hoot, transcribed as ooooooo-ooh which rises markedly at the end. Juvenile Conservation Although the rufescent tiger heron's population size and trend has not been quantified, its range is huge, so the International Union for the Conservation of Nature lists it as a species of least concern.

The husband of novelist and biographer Elizabeth Gaskell, he was himself a writer and poet. His personal theology was Priestleian rationalism; he rejected the doctrine of original sin, believing humans to have an innate capacity for good, and this belief seems to have underpinned his lifelong commitment to charitable and educational projects.Uglow pp.Hughes P. 'William Gaskell', Unitarian Universalist Historical Society (accessed 24 July 2007) Unlike many of his Manchester contemporaries, Gaskell always favoured social and educational work above political lobbying for free trade or factory reform. His personal philosophy can perhaps be summarised in his dedication which he penned at the publication of his poetry collection Temperance Rhymes: 'to the working men of Manchester ... in the hope that they may act as another small weight on the right end of that lever which is to raise them in the scale of humanity.' Early life and education Gaskell was born in Latchford, a suburb of Warrington, the eldest of six children.Brill pp. 3–4 The Gaskell family were prominent Dissenters. His father, also William, was a sailcloth manufacturer with a business on Buttermarket Street and also a Unitarian theology teacher; according to one source, his mother, Margaret Jackson, was a housemaid. He was tutored by a local minister, Joseph Saul.Brill p. 12 Barred as a non-conformist from attending Oxford or Cambridge, Gaskell studied at Glasgow University (1820–25), taking his BA and MA in 1825. He then trained for the Unitarian ministry at Manchester New College (1825–28), at that time located in York, where his tutors included Charles Wellbeloved and James Turner.  Work  Ministry Cross Street Chapel c. 1835 Gaskell became the minister of Cross Street Chapel in Manchester in 1828, a position he held until his death.A Brief History of Cross Street Chapel Retrieved before 10 December 2016. Founded in 1694,Cross Street Chapel website (accessed 25 July 2007) Cross Street was the major Unitarian chapel of the city, and its congregation contained many influential Manchester figures, at one time including five MPs. The prominent public health reformers James P. Kay (later Sir James Kay-Shuttleworth), Benjamin Heywood and Samuel and William Rathbone Greg were all associated with the chapel. Contemporaries considered Gaskell to be a brilliant preacher, though he never spoke extemporaneously; he was certainly a hard-working one, often preaching three times on Sundays. The Ministers of the Chapel by and large abstained from overt political involvement, but they were active in social work, underpinning the thrust of their laypeople. William Gaskell led the congregation from 1828 to 1884, exercising wide influence within and outside the Unitarian movement. He supported the Manchester Domestic Mission Society, which assisted the poor “in such a way that at no time should any denominational or sectarian name or test be introduced”. He championed the Lower Mosley Street Schools, which the Cross Street Chapel sponsored to serve the areas near the River Medlock. A Fellowship Fund supported congregations in poorer locations. A nurse superintended by a lady of the congregation was financed to visit poor families near the town centre. Gaskell worked for education opportunities for the area's working class, and advocated for the Mechanics Institute movement. He was chairman of the Portico Library from 1849 to his death in 1884. Gaskell was legendary in humanitarian efforts. To honor his fifty-year point in the Cross Street ministry, a soirée has held in Manchester Town Hall; it was attended by over one thousand people. The congregation honored him with a gift of silverware, and during the festivities a large sum of money was raised for the founding of a scholarship for ministerial students at Owen's College (now Manchester University). William Gaskell was supported in his educational and humanitarian work by his wife, the novelist Elizabeth Gaskell. He came to be numbered among the most prominent Unitarians in the country; in 1859, he was offered the ministry at Essex Street Chapel in London, the leading post in the British Unitarian ministry, but turned it down, preferring to remain at Cross Street. From 1865, he served as President of the Assembly of Presbyterian and Unitarian Ministers of Lancashire and Cheshire. In 1861 he co-founded the Unitarian Herald, a publication aimed at the working-class audience, and was an editor until 1875. Charitable works Throughout his life, Gaskell worked for numerous local charitable concerns to alleviate poverty, improve living conditions and reduce the transmission of disease, particularly epidemic cholera and typhus. During the 1830s–1860s, some of the worst conditions for the poor in England were to be found in Manchester.Briggs A. Victorian Cities (2nd ed.) (Pelican Books; 1968) In 1845, Engels described one of the poorest slums, not far from the Gaskells' house:Engels F The Condition of the Working Class in England (1845) > 'ruinous cottages behind broken windows, mended with oilskin, sprung doors, > and rotten doorposts, [...] dark wet cellars, in measureless filth and > stench...' It was also a city of extreme social inequality between the so-called 'millocracy' and the workers; Elizabeth Gaskell once described an acquaintance attending a ball wearing £400 of lace and £10,000 in diamonds.Letter to Marianne Gaskell (December 1863) in Chapple & Pollard The Gaskell family moved between the two worlds, allowing Gaskell not only to collect charitable subscriptions from their wide circle and promote longer-lasting changes from within the local bureaucracy, but also to understand the real concerns of those living in poverty, with whom he was probably more at ease. In 1833 he helped to found the non-denominational Manchester Domestic Home Mission, and he acted as its secretary for many years. Inspired by a visit from Boston minister Joseph Tuckerman, the mission gave practical assistance such as food and blankets to the poor. He was also active in the District Provident Society, an organisation founded by James Kay and William Langton with similar pragmatic aims. Gaskell supported public health measures and housing reform, sitting on the committee of the Manchester and Salford Sanitary Association, as well as another committee formed to regulate beer halls in the area. Education and societies Gaskell was a gifted teacher and lecturer, with a lifelong determination to expand the educational opportunities available to the working classes in Manchester. Such opportunities were limited in the 1830s; a Manchester Statistical Society report of 1834 showed that, with the exception of Manchester Grammar School and Chetham's Hospital, the main establishments involved in educating the poor were Sunday Schools. These schools gave children of 5–15 years a few hours of education each Sunday, with two-thirds of children benefitting. Two-thirds of the Sunday Schools worked outside the Church of England.Shercliff WH. Manchester: A Short History of its Development, pp. 35–38 (Municipal Information Bureau, Town Hall, Manchester; 1960) Both the Gaskells taught at the two Mosley Street Sunday Schools, which instructed young mill workers. Lessons covered basic numeracy and literacy in addition to traditional Biblical teaching, and Gaskell defended the practice of giving non-religious instruction on a Sunday, saying that they were doing 'their Father's business' by teaching reading. He and others lobbied successfully in 1832 for the two schools to be moved to improved premises, and some 400 pupils had been enrolled by 1847. Manchester Mechanics' Institute, Cooper Street (1825) In 1836, Gaskell started to give evening classes at the Manchester Mechanics' Institute, which was later to become the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology. Founded in 1824 to teach the poorest mill workers the institute was the first of its kind in the country.Stevens THG. Manchester of Yesterday, p.102 (John Sherratt & Son; 1958) Its principal goal was to give mill workers sufficient knowledge so they might keep pace with the rapid technological progress of the time. From the first, however, Gaskell seems to have embraced the idea of a broader education: his initial lecture series was entitled 'The Poets and Poetry of Humble Life'. Elizabeth wrote that her husband's lectures aimed to increase appreciation of 'the beauty and poetry of many of the common things and daily events of life in its humblest aspect'.Letter to Mary Howitt (18 August 1838) in Chapple & Pollard The lectures were popular, and Gaskell repeated them in several other venues. Who those 'humble poets' actually were no one knows but he is known to have studied J. F. Bryant and many other contemporary poets living in Manchester, including his friend, Samuel Bamford. Gaskell became renowned for his reading, which a former student described as 'clear and sweet'; his reading of poetry was recalled to have 'a peculiar charm, for while he had a keen ear for the subtleties of rhyme, rhythm and metre, nothing was ever lost of the meaning or the beauty of the words'. When the New College moved to Manchester in 1840 Gaskell continued to lecture on literature. In 1846, he was appointed Professor of history, English literature and logic. (Another professor was Gaskell's contemporary from his studies at York, the prominent Unitarian James Martineau.) When the college later moved to London, he served as Chairman of the Trustees. He also lectured at the Owens College, founded in 1846 with a legacy from John Owens (it became the Victoria University of Manchester in 1904). Beginning in 1858, Gaskell taught literature at the Manchester Working Men's College. He also gave private tutoring to both men and women; notable pupils included hymn translator Catherine Winkworth and her sister, the translator Susanna Winkworth. In 1854 Gaskell co-founded (with John Beard) the Unitarian Home Missionary Board, which trained working-class Unitarian ministers. He taught literature, history, and New Testament Greek, initially from his study at Plymouth Grove. He became its Principal in 1874. In addition to his tutoring and lecturing, Gaskell campaigned for better education for the working classes, co-founding the Lancashire Public Schools Association in 1847. He served on the committee of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society, which gave public lectures and campaigned for social change; in 1849, he became the Chairman of the Portico Library, a subscription lending library. In 1861, he helped to organise a meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science which brought scientists from across the world to Manchester. Gaskell seemed to relish the immense teaching burden he accumulated in later life. Elizabeth Gaskell complained that 'you might as well ask St Pauls to tumble down, as entreat him to give up this piece of work; which does interest him very much, & which no one could do so well certainly...'Letter to Anne Robson (10 May 1865) in Chapple & Pollard Though she was referring specifically to his Owens College lectures, he seems to have diligently pursued all his various projects, and found excuses to avoid giving up any obligation he had once started. Literature and writings Gaskell had a fascination with language and was an expert on the Lancashire dialect. Extracts from his lectures on dialect were published in The Examiner, and the 1854 edition of Elizabeth Gaskell's first novel, Mary Barton, was accompanied by his notes on dialect. He published numerous pamphlets and sermons, and wrote or translated over seventy hymns, some of which are still sung. His poem, \\"Sketches among the Poor, No. 1\\" (co-written with his wife in the manner of Crabbe), was published in Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine in 1837, and his poetry collection Temperance Rhymes (1839) won the approval of Wordsworth. His poetry varied in form, but always employed plain language and attempted sensitive portrayals of characters drawn from the working classes. The poem \\"Manchester Song\\" supplies two of the chapter epigraphs to Mary Barton.Gaskell E. Mary Barton (Chapman & Hall; 1848) Religious writings *The Person of Christ 1853A Lecture on the Person of Christ, delivered in Bridge Street Chapel, Manchester, 9 February 1853. By Rev. W. Gaskell, MA, being one of a course on \\" The True and the False in Religion.\\"The Religious Opinion of Milton, Locke and Newton, p. 91. \\"Seventy years later William Gaskell protested against Manchester Unitarians being called \\" Socinians \\" Personal life and Elizabeth Gaskell 84 Plymouth Grove, Gaskell's home from 1850 Gaskell married Elizabeth Cleghorn Stevenson, daughter of the late Unitarian minister William Stevenson, in 1832. The couple had four surviving daughters. Despite differences in personality, the couple seem to have had a strong relationship, although they frequently spent long periods apart, and Elizabeth Gaskell's biographer Jenny Uglow describes her as breathing more freely when William was away, but still always longing for his return. Unfortunately, none of Elizabeth's many letters to him survives. Gaskell is said to have encouraged his wife to write her first novel as a distraction from her grief at the death of their infant son from scarlet fever in 1845. Elizabeth Gaskell's industrial novels Mary Barton and North and South were directly inspired by her experiences as a minister's wife in the cotton-manufacturing city of Manchester. Gaskell always encouraged his wife's writing, advising her on dialect, editing her manuscripts and acting as her literary agent. He also supported her when some of her novels, particularly Mary Barton and Ruth, drew strong criticism for their radical views, as well as through the threatened lawsuits over her biography of Charlotte Brontë. Elizabeth died suddenly in 1865. William Gaskell survived his wife by almost two decades, working full-time until six months before his death, aided by his two unmarried daughters. He died of bronchitis in Manchester in 1884, and is buried beside Elizabeth at Brook Street Chapel, Knutsford.Brill pp. 117–8 Legacy Rev.

It is in the monotypic genus Zebrilus. It is found in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Peru, Suriname, and Venezuela. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical swamps. Sani Lodge - Ecuador The zigzag heron is a species of the entire Amazon Basin, east of the Andes cordillera, and the five bordering countries on the basin's western periphery, Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia. The range does not extend beyond the Orinoco River basin of Venezuela in the northwest, and in the east-northeast encompasses the Guianas; in the southeast Amazon Basin the range does not extend east of the Tapajós River drainage. They are reclusive birds, staying hidden in thick cover even while foraging. The adult plumage is gray with fine zigzag barring, with a pale underside, standing about 32 cm(12.6 in) in height. Juveniles have a dark back with a brown head and underside. Due to its appearance it was often assigned to the tiger herons (Tigrisoma and allies). But in fact, it is a true bittern, having like these only 10 rectrices (other Ardeidae have 12) and being unequivocally placed in the bittern lineage by DNA sequence data too. Short legs and necks and cryptic plumage may thus be plesiomorphic among Ardeidae in general.

PAPB is specifically bactericidal at very low concentrations (10 mg/l) and is also fungicidal. Biocidal activity It has a unique method of action: the polymer strands are incorporated into the bacterial cell membrane, which disrupts the membrane and reduces its permeability, which has a lethal effect to bacteria. It is also known to bind to bacterial DNA, alter its transcription, and cause lethal DNA damage. Disinfectant PAPB solutions are sold for use as a general disinfectant solution to be applied onto skin. As it is not cytotoxic, it can be applied directly into wounds. It is also not irritating like more traditional disinfectants such as alcohols (ethanol, isopropanol) and oxidizers (iodine).

Description It is a small, roundish dark brown bird with a short narrow tail and a dull whitish breast. It is a bright multicolored bird, named for its cap, which is a deep chestnut. A medium orange, narrow collar on the upper back borders the chestnut cap and ends at the side of the neck in a spot. A second collar, similar to that of the collared puffbird, is on the upper breast, wider on the sides, narrow under the throat, and deep black. The black collar is parallel to a second deep black stripe, an eye-stripe across the lower eye from the side to the bill. The deep chestnut cap and two black stripes enclose two parallel bright white stripes. The bill is stout, short and medium black, with a decurved tip. The bird has black eyes, black legs, and also short light-buff whiskered-feathers surrounding the base of its bill (moustachial). These bright head colors contrast with a duller colored body and breast. Distribution and habitat It is found in northwestern South America in the western Amazon Basin of Brazil, in Amazonian Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, northern Bolivia, and in the eastern Orinoco River Basin of Venezuela. Its natural habitats are subtropical and tropical moist lowland forests and subtropical or tropical swamps. Range: western Amazon Basin The chestnut-capped puffbird is found in the western Amazon Basin, and in the north in Venezuela, the upper and eastern reaches of the Orinoco River Basin and eastwards into Brazil's Roraima state, in the west. It is not found east of Roraima's south-flowing Branco River. On the Amazon River its range starts upstream of the Madeira River confluence, but the entire Madeira is its eastern limit in the Basin's southwest quadrant, extending upstream into its tributaries in northern Bolivia. Likewise it is at the confluence of the Amazon River and the Rio Negro, but its range skips to above the Branco River-Rio Negro confluence. This contiguous range in the northeast goes northwards into southern-central Venezuela bordering Roraima state in Brazil, then southwards through Amazonian southeast Colombia, eastern Ecuador, eastern Peru, and extreme northern Bolivia.

Ironclad floating battery of the , spending the winter of 1855–1856 in the Crimea. The floating battery Paixhans (1862), designed for war in Cochinchina French armoured floating battery Arrogante (1864) A floating battery is a kind of armed watercraft, often improvised or experimental, which carries heavy armament but has few other qualities as a warship.  History  An early appearance was in 1782 at the Great Siege of Gibraltar, and its invention and usage is attributed to Spanish Lieutenant General Antonio Barceló. A purpose-built floating battery was Flådebatteri No. 1,. designed by Chief Engineer Henrik Gerner in 1787; it was long, wide and armed with 24 guns, and was used during the 1801 Battle of Copenhagen under the command of Peter Willemoes. The British made limited use of floating batteries during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, with the two-vessel and -class floating batteries, and some individual vessels. The most notable floating batteries were built or designed in the 19th century, and are related to the development of the first steam warship and the ironclad warship. Demologos, the first steam-propelled warship, was a floating battery designed for the protection of New York Harbor in the War of 1812. In the 1850s, the British and French navies deployed iron- armoured floating batteries as a supplement to the wooden steam battlefleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmoured mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used their batteries in 1855 against the defenses at Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. The British planned to use theirs in the Baltic Sea against Kronstadt, and may have been influential in causing the Russians to sue for peace.Lambert A., \\"Iron Hulls and Armour Plate\\"; Gardiner, Steam, Steel and Shellfire, pp. 47–55 However, Kronstadt was widely regarded as the most heavily fortified naval arsenal in the world throughout most of the 19th-century, continually upgrading its combined defences to meet new changes in technology. Even as the British armoured-batteries were readied against Kronstadt in early 1856, the Russians had already constructed newer networks of outlying forts, mortar batteries of their own, and submarine mines against which the British had no system for removing under fire. Traditional floating battery called kotta mara was used by the Banjar and Dayak against the Dutch during the Banjar war (1859-1906). The battery is made by adding walls (sloped and unsloped) to a raft made by large logs. Some of them shaped like a castle and had bastions with 4 cannons on each bastion. The kotta mara could resist the Dutch 30-pounder cannons until 24.5 m range, the range which the cannon could effectively penetrate it.van Rees, Willem Adriaan (1867). De Bandjermasinsche Krijg van 1859-1863 nader toegelicht. Arnhem: D.A. Thieme. Floating batteries were popularly implemented by both the Union and the Confederacy during the American Civil War. The first was the Confederate Floating Battery of Charleston Harbor, which took an active part in the bombardment of Fort Sumter in April 1861. Experimental ironclad vessels that proved too cumbersome or were underpowered were often converted into floating batteries and posted for river and coastal waterway control. Here too, Civil War batteries and even ironclads such as the famed monitors, were acutely vulnerable to mines protected in turn by forts. As a result, the combined defences of Charleston, South Carolina, for example, were never overwhelmed by the Union Navy.

Her purpose was to aid ships, usually by towing, on the high seas or in combat or post-combat areas, plus \\"other duties as assigned.\\" She served in the Pacific Ocean and had a very successful career marked by the winning of three battle stars during World War II, two during the Korean War, and seven campaign stars during the Vietnam crisis. Tawasa was laid down on 22 June 1942 at Portland, Oregon, by the Commercial Iron Works; launched on 22 February 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Thomas F. Sullivan, mother of the five Sullivan brothers; and commissioned on 17 July 1943, Lt. Fred C. Clark in command.  World War II Pacific Theatre operations  Tawasa held her shakedown cruise off the lower California coast in late August and returned to Portland. The tug steamed to San Pedro, California, in October and departed there on the 20th for Hawaii, towing two fuel oil barges. She arrived at Pearl Harbor on 4 November and was assigned to Service Force, Pacific Fleet. The next day, the tug headed for the Ellice Islands and arrived at Funafuti on the 20th.  Supporting invasion forces  Tawasa was routed onward to the Gilbert Islands and arrived on 26 November at Abemama, which, only the day before, had been taken by American marines. On 3 December, she moved to Tarawa. The tug made round trips between Tarawa and Funafuti in December 1943 and January 1944. On 21 January, she stood out of Tarawa and rendezvoused with Task Force (TF) 52, the Southern Attack Force, for the invasion of the Marshall Islands. Off Kwajalein Atoll on the 31st, Tawasa took soundings enabling to approach the shore for close bombardment. The tug then performed salvage, towing, and screening duty until 18 February when she moved to Eniwetok to assist in the assault that was to strike that atoll the next morning. She supported operations until the atoll was secured and remained in the area for almost two months, providing services to American ships using this new base. Tawasa departed the Marshalls on 12 April for a tender availability at Pearl Harbor and to have a radar installed. The tug returned to the Marshalls on 25 May. On 11 June, she was in the transport screen of TF 52, the Northern Attack Force, when it sortied for the Mariana Islands. Four days later, she was detached to assist LST's as they landed marines and equipment on Saipan. On 7 July, she got underway for Eniwetok. Tawasa operated with ServRon 10 from 31 July to 24 August 1944 when she joined ServRon, South Pacific. The ship operated in the South Pacific until 9 May 1946 when she departed Nouméa for the United States.  Post-war activity  From San Pedro, her home port, she operated along the California coast until returning to Pearl Harbor on 27 December 1946. On 23 February 1947, Tawasa headed for Japan and an eight-month tour at Yokosuka before returning home on 30 October 1947. The tug headed for Alaska on 15 June 1948 and operated out of Adak until October when she steamed to Guam for four months. She then remained on the west coast until 10 August 1950 when she got underway for a five-month tour in Alaska. During the next decade, her operations on the west coast were broken by seven deployments to the Far East for operations with the 7th Fleet.  Korean War operations  On the first of these deployments, from 4 June 1952 to 1 March 1953, Tawasa operated with task force TF 92, the Logistics Support Force which supplied United Nations forces in Korea. She also performed services at the Korean ports of Cho Do, Sokcho, and Chinhae.  Operation Wigwam  Tawasa towed a nuclear bomb used as a depth charge as it was detonated in Operation Wigwam in 1955. Wigwam involved a single test of the Mark 90 Betty nuclear bomb, a cold war nuclear depth charge, developed by the United States in 1952. The test was conducted on May 14, 1955, about southwest of San Diego, California, with 6,800 personnel aboard 30 ships involved. The purpose of Wigwam was to determine the vulnerability of submarines to deeply detonated nuclear weapons, and to evaluate the feasibility of using such weapons. The test device was suspended to a depth of by a cable attached to a barge. A tow line connected the 205 ft. Tawasa fleet tug with the shot barge itself. Suspended from the tow lines of other tugs were three miniature unmanned submarines named \\"Squaws\\", each packed with cameras and telemetry instruments. The time of detonation was 1300 hrs Pacific Time. The test was carried out without incident, and the device yielded 30 kilotons. Three personnel received doses of over 0.5 rem (5 mSv). Other sailors on (another Cherokee-class fleet tug) were tasked with measuring radiation and said that the ocean water boiled and churned, and radiation meters went off the charts when they held them over the side. The sailors wore no protection, only their standard cotton clothes. One sailor on the Cree had three cornea transplants without any official recognition by the U.S. government. The feeling on the feet of the sailors when it went off was like a sledge hammer hitting the deck of the ship.  1962 and later  Tawasa deployed to the western Pacific again from 13 February 1962 to 3 July 1962. On 29 December 1962, she took in tow at San Francisco, California, and delivered the submarine to Pearl Harbor before returning to San Diego, California, on 1 February 1963. She operated with the 7th Fleet from April to November 1964, and with the Alaskan Sea Frontier from June to September 1965. In December 1965, the tug towed from San Francisco, California, to San Diego. This was the largest operational tow made by a tug of the Pacific Fleet — . She returned to Alaska from 8 February to 11 April 1967.  Vietnam War operations  Tawasa's next deployment to the western Pacific placed the ship in a combat zone for the third time in her naval career. On 5 February 1968, she stood out of San Diego for San Francisco to pick up YFN-1126 and deliver the covered lighter to Hawaii. She left her charge at Pearl Harbor on 17 February 1968, and headed for the Philippine Islands the following week to provide target services for ships at Subic Bay until 13 April 1968 when she headed for Vietnam. Tawasa arrived at Da Nang on 17 April 1968, and departed the next day for special operations that lasted for a month. She returned to Subic Bay on 21 May 1968 for a week and then steamed to Sattahip, Thailand, to provide drone services for the Royal Thai Navy. The tug called at Da Nang on 19 June 1968 and began special operations that lasted until 10 July 1968. Upon conclusion of the mission, the tug called at Hong Kong and Yokosuka, Japan, before returning to San Diego, California, on 26 August 1968. She entered the Campbell Machine Yard there the following month for an overhaul which lasted until 21 January 1969. On 5 March 1969, Tawasa got underway for the Philippines and Vietnam. She called at Da Nang and then proceeded to \\"Yankee Station\\" for surveillance duty. The ship was relieved on 22 May 1969 and sailed, via Hong Kong, for Singapore. However, on 3 June 1969 the tug went to the assistance of destroyer which had collided with the Australian aircraft carrier . Evans had been cut in two and only the stern section was afloat. Tawasa took the section in tow and returned it to Subic Bay before continuing on her original voyage. She was at Singapore on 16 June and 17 June 1969, and left for Vũng Tàu with YF-866 in tow. She dropped off the lighter on 19 June 1969, and picked up a repair barge the next day before proceeding via Subic Bay to Guam. After returning to Subic Bay on 8 July, Tawasa made two additional voyages to Vũng Tàu before returning to San Diego on 24 September 1969.  North Pacific operations  Tawasa was deployed to the western Pacific again from 16 March to 4 October 1970, and from 8 November 1972 to 15 June 1973. In 1971, the tug deployed to Kodiak from July to November to serve as a search and rescue vessel.  Final decommissioning  After returning to San Diego in 1973, Tawasa remained in California waters until 1 April 1975 when she was decommissioned and struck from the Navy List. She was sold for scrapping by the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service (DRMS), 1 August 1976.  Awards  Tawasa received three battle stars for World War II service: * Gilbert Islands operation; 26 November to 8 December 1943 * Marshall Islands operation; Occupation of Kwajalein and Majuro Atolls, 31 January to 18 February 1944; Occupation of Eniwetok Atoll, 18 February to 2 March 1944 * Marianas operation; Assault and occupation of Saipan, 11 June to 7 July 1944 Two battle stars for Korean operations: * Korean Defense Summer-Fall 1952; 19 July to 10 August 1952, 3 November to 30 November 1952 * Third Korean Winter; 1 December to 5 December 1952, 29 December 1952 to 3 January 1953 Seven campaign stars for Vietnam Crisis: * Vietnamese Counteroffensive - Phase IV; 15 April to 20 May 1968, 30 May to 30 June 1968 * Vietnamese Counteroffensive - Phase V; 1 July to 13 July 1968 * Tet 69/Counteroffensive; 20 April to 24 May 1969, 2 June to 4 June 1969 * Vietnam Summer-Fall 1969; 13 June to 14 June 1969, 18 June to 21 June 1969, 25 July to 28 July 1969, 5 August to 7 August 1969 * Sanctuary Counteroffensive; 23 May to 26 May 1970, 18 June to 20 June 1970 * Vietnamese Counteroffensive - Phase VII; 30 July to 3 August 1970 * Consolidation II Consolidation II; 21 February to 28 March 1972  See also  * List of United States Navy ships * Tugboat  References   External links  * * Photos of Boat and Crew Circa 1943-1948?

It is seldom found near forest edges, and is more restricted to forests than its close relatives, but is often found near running water. The species is usually uncommon, but may be overlooked frequently due to its habit of remaining motionless for hours. It is assumed to be non-migratory. It is usually found in high foliage in the canopy, but will descent to the forest floor to pursue prey flushed by army ants, and even follow swarms of them. The Black-fronted puffbird takes a range of prey species, including centipedes and millipedes, scorpions, spiders, cockroaches, praying mantises, grasshoppers, beetles and lizards. It hunts by watching for prey at a perch before diving down to take it, then returning to the perch to beat the prey prior to eating it. Little is known about its breeding. Both parents excavate the nesting burrow in the arboreal termitariums. Three eggs are laid, and both parents incubate the eggs.

This bottom-dwelling species is found across the North Atlantic and adjacent parts of the Arctic Ocean from north of Russia and the Scandinavian Peninsula to the Scotian Shelf, off Nova Scotia, Canada. In Canada the population declined by about 90% from the late 1970s through the early 1990s, particularly in the northern part of its range. In Canada it is classified as a threatened species.  General description  They have prominent canine-like teeth in the front of both jaws; a heavy head with a blunt, rounded snout; small eyes; a long, stout body with no pelvic fins; a long dorsal fin extending to the base of caudal; flexible spiny rays; a small, slightly rounded caudal fin; rounded pectoral fins; firm musculature; colours variable from pale olive to deep brown with upper parts sprinkled with irregularly shaped blackish-brown spots; maximum length to over and weight to .Department of Fisheries and Oceans, Spotted Wolffish: A Species at Risk in the North, Government of Canada, 2005.  Similar species  The spotted wolffish can be distinguished from the northern (A. denticulatus) and Atlantic wolffish (A. lupus) by its dark spots.  Distribution  Spotted wolffish occur in the Arctic Ocean and on both sides of the North Atlantic Ocean from Labrador to the Barents Sea. Its northern limit in Canada is Baffin Bay, although its presence is rare. In the western North Atlantic, it is found off east and west Greenland, on the Labrador Shelf and Grand Banks and less commonly on the Scotian Shelf.  Habitat and life history  This species is found offshore in cold, deep water, usually below and between in depth but as shallow as in Canadian Arctic populations. They prefer a coarse sand and sand/shell hash bottom with rocky areas nearby for shelter and nest-building. Spawning occurs in summer to late fall/early winter. As many as 54,600 large eggs [up to in diameter] are laid in deep water in clusters on the sea floor, and are guarded primarily by males. Growth rate is slower for this species than for the Atlantic and northern wolffish (Barents Sea). Fish become mature at seven years of age or older and can live to 21 years. The species does not form large schools and migrations are local and limited.  Diet  The diet of this fish consists primarily of hard-shelled invertebrates found on the bottom, such as crustaceans and mollusks. Echinoderms, tube worms, seaweeds and fish have also been reported in the gut contents of the spotted wolffish.  Conservation status  This species has been identified as threatened by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC). It is listed under the Canadian federal Species at Risk Act and was afforded protection under it as of June 2004.Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada According to the 2001 COSEWIC assessment of this species, it has not been given international protection status. As of 2020, it is not listed or categorized on the IUCN Red List.  Threats  Overfishing and habitat alteration are believed to have played a role in the observed declines in wolffish abundance. In Canadian waters, this species is not targeted by the fishing industry, but bycatch mortality by offshore trawlers and long-liners is considered a threat. In addition, activities that disturb the ocean bottom, such as trawling, may damage spawning habitat.  References  Further reading *Scott and Scott 1988; Stock Status Report 2004/031 2003.

As with an initiative, a popular referendum is held after a given number of signatures supporting it have been submitted to the authorities; in some cases, such a referendum may also be initiated by regional authorities. Depending on local legislation, the popular referendum may be implemented only in a short window of time after the legislation has been passed; in others it may be used to defeat any existing legislation.Referendums, ACE Encyclopedia, Electoral Knowledge NetworkDavid Butler, Austin Ranney, Referendums around the world: the growing use of direct democracy, American Enterprise Institute, 1994, , Google Print, p.63 Specific details on the applicable procedure (such as the number of signatures, whether there is a time limit and its duration on when the popular referendum may be passed, and the body to which they must be submitted) vary from country to country (and in the United States, from state to state). Supporters of the popular referendum point out that it is a safeguard against special interests taking over, and protects the rights of minorities. Critics point out that direct democracy votes are dominated by people who have strong feelings about the issue at hand, and as such, it empowers special interests.

It is found in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Panama, Peru, Suriname, and Venezuela. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forest and heavily degraded former forest. Taxonomy The pied puffbird was described by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in 1780 in his Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux from a specimen collected in Cayenne, French Guiana. The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by François- Nicolas Martinet in the Planches Enluminées D'Histoire Naturelle which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon's text. Neither the plate caption nor Buffon's description included a scientific name but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name Bucco tectus in his catalogue of the Planches Enluminées. The pied puffbird is now placed in the genus Notharchus that was introduced by the German ornithologists Jean Cabanis and Ferdinand Heine in 1863. The generic name combines the Ancient Greek nōthēs meaning \\"sluggish\\" and arkhos meaning \\"leader\\" or \\"chief\\". The specific epithet tectus is Latin for \\"covered\\" or \\"concealed\\". Three subspecies are recognised: * N. t. subtectus (Sclater, PL, 1860) – east Costa Rica to central Colombia and southwest Ecuador * N. t. picatus (Sclater, PL, 1856) – east Ecuador and east Peru * N. t. tectus (Boddaert, 1783) – south Venezuela, the Guianas and north Brazil Gallery Image:Pied Puffbird RWD3.jpgIn Panama Image:Pied_Puffbird.png Sacha Lodge, Ecuador Image:Pied_Puffbird_2.png Sacha Lodge, Ecuador References pied puffbird Category:Birds of Costa Rica Category:Birds of Panama Category:Birds of Colombia Category:Birds of the Tumbes-Chocó-Magdalena Category:Birds of the Amazon Basin Category:Birds of the Guianas pied puffbird Category:Birds of Brazil Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Pied puffbird"},{"id":"12421226","text":"The white-eared puffbird (Nystalus chacuru) is a species of bird in the Bucconidae family, the puffbirds. It is found in Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay, Argentina, and Peru. Its natural habitats are subtropical and tropical dry forests, subtropical and tropical moist lowland forests, dry savanna, and heavily degraded former forest. Description Like some other puffbirds, the white-eared puffbird is a round, plump bird with a short, very narrow tail. It has a large head and orange, black-tipped bill, the head appearing almost too large for its body. The sit-and-wait feeding strategy, for insects or opportunistic prey, may explain this body shape. The bird has a medium brown back and wings, white and black flecked on the breast. The upper breast is white, extending to a narrow-to-medium-width white collar surrounding the neck. The species is named for its distinctive, medium-sized bright white ear patch. It has blackish eyes, black surrounding the white ear patch, and the same brown on its crown as on the wings and back. Distribution Range: SE Cerradan Brazil The white-eared puffbird's range is in south-eastern Brazil, centered on the Cerrado region, and on the southeast Atlantic coast from northern Bahia state south to the Paraná-Santa Catarina state borders. It covers much of the eastern and northern Pantanal, and southern areas of the Caatinga. The north and west parts of its range include the upstream headwaters of some Amazon Basin river systems, encompassing nearly all of northern Bolivia, the Madeira River's many headwater tributaries, and the extreme headwaters of the Tapajós River. East of the Tapajós, the range expands into the Cerrado, the upper half of the Xingu River drainage, and the entire drainage system of the Araguaia-Tocantins River (the eastward system, generally considered part of the Amazon Basin). The bird is found in Peru on the very western border region of Bolivia and in some localities in north- central Peru. Another second locale is mid-river on the downstream Madeira River in southern Amazon Basin Amazonas state.

Synopsis The film opens with an overhead shot of a sprawling railroad yard in the morning, where all the trains are \\"fast asleep\\". The shot begins to focus on a single train with Johnny, an American Standard 4-4-0 (#2), where Casey is revealed to be \\"slow asleep\\" in his engine's cab. He quickly awakens and realizes that he is fully behind schedule and ends up hurriedly readying the engine to depart. Mail is loaded aboard the mail car on the train and with a toot on the whistle, Casey sets off at a high speed through the maze of switches and sidings, nearly T-boning two other trains in the process before making it safely out of the yard with the Narrator shouting loudly. At first the trip is uneventful. Further on, however, the weather becomes nasty, flooding the tracks and all but swamping the entire train. Eight hours late, but nonetheless undaunted, Casey climbs up onto the cab roof and uses his coal shovel as a paddle. Before long, when the flood has cleared, Casey is on his way again. No sooner has the train been back up to full speed than Casey is forced to bring it screeching to a halt: a large brown cow is standing in the middle of the tracks grazing. After much shouting and whistle blowing on Casey's part, the cow clears and the train speeds onward as Casey starts shoveling the coal into the furnace. Yet another problem presents itself: a stereotypical villain with a black handlebar mustache has tied a lady to the tracks in front of Casey's train where Casey screams in terror. Unwilling to waste any more time stopping, Casey rushes forward, stands on Johnny's cowcatcher, and scoops up the terrified woman just seconds in the moment in which the train is about to run her over. Casey is in such a hurry now, that he doesn't have time to even stop to let her off, depositing her (rope and all) in the arms of a pleasantly surprised stationmaster as he rushes past the next platform at full speed. Nightfall has come and Casey's engine is found steaming full-bore through a narrow, snow- covered mountain pass. As the train passes over a high trestle spanning a gorge however while Casey is stoking the boiler and blowing into the firebox to make the train go faster, another stereotypical villain nearly brings things to an explosive end. Once again undaunted, Casey's engine struggles, huffing and puffing, up the side of the gorge and continues on his way. A short while later, a group of armed gangsters on horseback watch the train from up on a hillside in a desert and charge down toward the train. The gang is soon in the cab, brandishing their guns and knives menacingly at Casey, who, while shoveling coal into the furnace, is oblivious to their very presence. It is in the next moment that he accidentally picks up one of the bandits standing on his shovel-full of coal that he finally notices the uninvited company for almost shoveling one into the engine's furnace. Even then, Casey is extremely annoyed by this new distraction than anything else, and begins to fight the train bandits, hitting them repeatedly with his shovel, while continuing to stoke the boiler with coal from the coal tender. After quickly throwing the last of the would-be thieves away from the train, Casey and his train continue onward when Casey checks his watch and screams when realizes that he is put way behind schedule with the thugs. Determined to make up for lost time whatever the cost, he opens the throttle so wide that he actually rips the handle from its mount and throws it away. The night time changes to day, and as the train speeds onward, the scenery outside quickly becomes a blur as the train travels faster and faster. When running out of coal, Casey throws in his shovel and rocking chair, and soon a myriad of structural problems arise which Casey addresses with frenzied skill and speed and bravely gives Johnny some running while the train is roaring down a hill. While otherwise occupied, Casey doesn't notice that another train, a slow freight train, double-headed by Zeb and Zeek, a pair of 4-8-0 tender engines, (#77 and 5) is coming toward him on the very same track in the opposite direction. Casey is blind to anything but his repairs and is too busy fixing the dome to take notice, and as the other train approaches him, Casey's engine's dome falls off and is fitted back by the brave engineer. The other engineer, an elder one, with a corn-cob pipe in his mouth, and on the other train, but even on spying Casey's train while piloting Zeb, and in fear of Casey's blind and furious approach, screams in fear, and blows Zeb's whistle to alert the others that Casey's train is heading toward them like a bullet in shock. The brake-man, upon seeing the double-headed slow freight train approaching, gasps, climbs out of the caboose, and runs up over the mail car, but heads up toward Johnny, and warns Casey about the oncoming train, but Casey can't hear him and says that they won't be late when he thinks that the train will be late. This annoys the conductor, who ends up trying to tell Casey about looking out behind him for the approaching train. As the other train approaches, the brake-man blows the whistle, but Casey scoffs 'So what?' to the conductor, who now fails to get the message through. But when the conductor says 'So long,' he jumps off the train, and in the far away next shot, a far away view from Casey's train, he is back on the train and is shown still standing there on Johnny's roof. The workers of the double header, who are approaching Casey's train, all gasp in terror, and quickly abandon their train as well by jumping out of Zeb and Zeek's cabs, and run for cover, and just as Casey now notices, he finally yelps in surprise before the two trains begin to collide with a violent chain reaction of large explosions in a cloud of black smoke. Afterwards, we are taken to a station, presumably the one Casey is meant to terminate at, and, with Casey being late, the Porter fears the worst. Then, much to his joy and surprise, Casey rolls down the hill in the remains of Johnny carrying a bag of mail. A beaten-up Casey then shows his watch with pride, which states he is 'ON TIME—ALMOST'. And the Narrator says 'Next time, take the train!' Differences between the cartoon and real life *The Brave Engineer depicts the wreck near Vaughan, Mississippi as a head-on collision with Casey's train steaming one way and another train steaming the other way, in an Ozark-like mountain range. In the real accident, Casey's engine had struck the rear end of a train, which was stopped on the tracks, due to a broken air line, and didn't occur in a mountain area. *The accident takes place in broad daylight and clear conditions in the cartoon. The real- life wreck occurred at night during a rain storm. *The Brave Engineer ends with Casey looking a little beat-up after the wreck, but very much alive. In real life, Casey was critically injured, and did not survive the accident for slamming on the brakes and making the wheels reverse. *The cartoon shows that Johnny is carrying the number 2, and being an old American Standard 4-4-0, also known as an American type steam locomotive. Such steam trains of this most common wheel arrangement were used on American railroads during the 1800s and 1830s until 1928, and were given the name \\"American\\" in 1872, because of all the work they did on every railroad in the United States. In reality, since his real engine, on the fateful trip, was number 382, a Ten-Wheeler 4-6-0, Clinchfield Railroad 4-6-0 #99, which is dolled up as a replica of No. 382, is currently on display at the Casey Jones Home & Railroad Museum in Jackson, Tennessee. *The two other locomotives, that are double-heading a slow freight train toward Casey, are Zeb and Zeek, a pair of Mastodon 4-8-0 engines numbers 77 and 5, who are struggling to take a lot of freight over the other side of the mountain, and have somehow ended in Johnny and Casey Jones' way. And when the workers jump off the train by jumping out of their engines' cabs, and run for cover, Casey, still fixing his engine, notices and gasps and crashes his train into the oncoming train with a large explosion and in a cloud of black smoke. *Casey is depicted operating the engine single-handedly in the cartoon. The real-life Casey Jones had an African-American fireman, Simeon \\"Sim\\" Webb, who was with him until mere seconds before the crash and was not in the 1950 cartoon. *These types of engines, that Casey pilots, are very different and have different wheel arrangements, such as the 4-6-0s having ten wheels (four leading, six driving wheels, and no trailing wheels), and the 4-4-0s having eight wheels (four leading, four driving wheels, and no trailing wheels).

The concept offered several advantages. Communities were more likely to accept the smaller squadrons than the large wings and the location of separate squadrons in smaller population centers would facilitate recruiting and manning. Continental Air Command (ConAC)'s plan called for placing Air Force Reserve units at fifty-nine installations located throughout the United States. When these relocations were completed in 1959, reserve wing headquarters and wing support elements would typically be on one base, along with one (or in some cases two) of the wing's flying squadrons, while the remaining flying squadrons were spread over thirty-five Air Force, Navy and civilian airfields under what was called the Detached Squadron Concept.Cantwell, pp. 156, 169 Although this dispersal was not a problem when the entire wing was called to active service, mobilizing a single flying squadron and elements to support it proved difficult. This weakness was demonstrated in the partial mobilization of reserve units during the Berlin Crisis of 1961 To resolve this, at the start of 1962, Continental Air Command, (ConAC) determined to reorganize its reserve wings by establishing groups with support elements for each of its troop carrier squadrons. This reorganization would facilitate mobilization of elements of wings in various combinations when needed. However, as this plan was entering its implementation phase, another partial mobilization occurred for the Cuban Missile Crisis, with the units being released on 22 November 1962. The formation of troop carrier groups occurred in January 1963 for units that had not been mobilized, but was delayed until February for those that had been.Cantwell, pp. 189-191 Activation of 911th Troop Carrier Group As a result, the 911th Troop Carrier Group was established at Greater Pittsburgh International Airport on 17 January 1963, as the headquarters for the 758th Troop Carrier Squadron, which had been stationed there since November 1957.Maurer, p. 740 Along with group headquarters, a Combat Support Squadron, Materiel Squadron and a Tactical Infirmary were organized to support the 758th. The group mission was to organize, recruit and train Air Force reserve personnel in the tactical airlift of airborne forces, their equipment and supplies and delivery of these forces and materials by airdrop, landing or cargo extraction systems. The group was equipped with Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcars for Tactical Air Command airlift operations. The 911th Group was one of three C-119 groups assigned to the 459th Troop Carrier Wing in 1963, the others being the 909th Troop Carrier Group at Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland, and the 910th Troop Carrier Group at Youngstown Municipal Airport, Ohio. The 911th trained for and participated in air transport of airborne forces, equipment and supplies with delivery by airdrop, extraction, and airlanding, as well as air evacuation within a theater of operations. It provided airlift to Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War and for other contingency operations, such as the Dominican Republic crisis in 1965, as well as numerous humanitarian flights. Beginning in 1973, it periodically rotated flight crews and other personnel to Panama, and later Puerto Rico, to support United States Southern Command commitments. Since the early 1990s it has frequently deployed personnel in support of contingency operations in Southwest Asia and the Balkans. A news story in the 10 April 2012 edition of the Air Force Times stated the 911th's base is being considered for closure by 2013.AF: Pittsburgh base closing will save $354M As of November, 2014, the future of the base is on solid ground. There are no plans to close it.http://triblive.com/news/allegheny/7141197-74/base-911-airlift Modern Era During the first week of April 2019, three out of the eight C-17s assigned to the 911th AW were delivered to the unit, to replace the wing's elderly C-130s. As of April 2020, seven C-17s are based in Pittsburgh with the final aircraft in depot maintenance. In April 2020, the 911th AW was one of 25 reserve units deployed to Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, New Jersey to participate in relief efforts amid the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City. Ten airmen from the 911th AW were part of a 125-member team mobilized to assist with medical support.

This law is one of the most primary anti-terrorism law that brings the Philippines in line with its Southeast Asian neighbors battling Islamist militants. It is aimed at tackling militants in the southern Philippines. The law defines terrorism a crime of \\"caus[ing] widespread and extraordinary fear and panic among the populace\\" and allows authorities to arrest terror suspects without warrants and temporarily detain them without charges for a maximum of three days. Under the law, detained terrorists are entitled to see a lawyer, a priest, a doctor, or family members.  Background  The first anti-terror bill was sponsored in Congress by Senator Juan Ponce Enrile in 1996; the bill that passed was close to Senator Enrile's proposal. The final version included many amendments by Senator Aquilino Pimentel, Jr. These revisions introduced several amendments and safeguards that have caused the law to be called \\"toothless\\" and \\"watered down\\". It was ratified by the Senate on February 8, then approved by the House of Representatives during a special session two weeks later on February 19, 2007. It was later signed into law by President Gloria Macapagal- Arroyo on March 6. It took effect on July 20, 2007. The Philippines had long been urged by the United States and other Western countries to bring in stricter anti-terror legislation, citing the presence of al Qaeda-linked extremists who have been blamed for bombings, beheadings, and kidnappings.  Summary  1\\\\. The State recognizes that the fight against terrorism requires a comprehensive approach, comprising political, economic, diplomatic, military, and legal means duly taking into account the root causes of terrorism without acknowledging these as justification for terrorist and/or criminal activities. Such measures shall include conflict management and post- conflict peace-building, addressing the roots of conflict by building state capacity and promoting equitable economic development.Republic of the Philippines House of Representative Bill on Human Security This statement elucidates that the Philippines government has realized that a strict military approach cannot be adequate solution when dealing with terrorist groups. In this sense, the Philippines government has decided to adopt a broader and more comprehensive approach rather than only applying a military approach. 2\\\\. Terrorism is the premeditated or threatened use of violence or force or any other means that deliberately cause harm to persons, or of force and other destructive means against property or the environment, with the intention of creating or sowing a state of danger, panic, fear, or chaos to the general public or segment thereof, or of coercing or intimidating the government to do or refrain from doing an act. Republic of the Philippines House of Representatives Bill on Human Security Section 3 The law provides for a clearer definition of terrorism allowing police and security services a better understanding of the crimes at stake.\\"Analysis and review of the Philippines Human Security Act 2007\\"(March 16, 2007), Kenneth Pereire, Research Analyst of International Centre for Political Violence and Terrorism Research This statement can act as a potential deterrent to future terrorists as they will know that it is no longer possible to commit an attack and escape without being charged. 3\\\\. Arrest and Detention. Any peace office or a private person may, without warrant, arrest a person: (a)when, in his presence, the person to be arrested has committed, is actually committing, or attempting to commit any of the offense under this Act; or (b)when any of said offense has in fact been committed and he has reasonable ground to believe that the person to be arrested has committed the same. Any person arrested under this Section may be detained for a period of not more than three(3)days following his arrest for custodial investigation. Republic of the Philippines House of Representatives Bill on Human Security In previous laws related to anti-terrorism, there were many loopholes that prevented terrorists suspects from being detained.Analysis and review of the Philippines Human Security Act 2007\\"(March 16, 2007), Kenneth Pereire, Research Analyst of International Centre for Political Violence and Terrorism Research However, this bill clarifies to Philippines Law Enforcement Agencies to arrest suspected terrorists without warrant and bestows the authority to detain suspects for 3 days.  Supreme Court ruling  In a 2010 ruling under Southern Hemisphere Engagement Network et. al. v. Anti-Terrorism Council et. al., the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the Human Security Act was constitutional. The court ruled that the petitioners had no legal standing because none of them have been charged under the said law. The Supreme Court ruled with finality on the matter in 2011, affirming its constitutionality.  International reaction  Allies in the United States-led War on Terrorism expressed confidence in the Philippines with the signing of the law. In a statement, the US Embassy said \\"this new law will help provide Philippine law enforcement and judicial authorities with the legal tools they need to confront the threats posed by international terrorism, while ensuring protection and civil liberties and human rights\\". Australian ambassador Tony Hely hailed the signing of the law and called the Philippines \\"a key regional counter-terrorism partner\\" for Australia. However, the Special Rapporteur of the UN on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, Martin Scheinin, issued the following statement; that the Philippine Government should reconsider \\"Human Security Act of 2007\\" since implementation of this law can negatively affect the human rights. He stated that even though there are some positive aspects of this law, an overly broad definition can be incompatible with Article 15 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).  Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020  During the presidency of Rodrigo Duterte, the Senate approved Senate Bill No. 1083 on February 26, 2020 and later the House of Representative approved House Bill No. 6875 on June 3, 2020. Both bills sought to amend the Human Security Act by imposing stronger measures to combat terrorism but has garnered criticism from human rights advocates who say the law will curtail civil liberties and be prone to constitutional abuse.
