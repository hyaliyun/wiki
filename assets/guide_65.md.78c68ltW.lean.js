Nixon, and again from May 12, 1986 to April 8, 1989, under President Ronald Reagan. As such, he was responsible for the early planning of the Space Shuttle program, and later for its recovery and return to flight after the Space Shuttle Challenger accident. Prior to this, he was president of the University of Utah from 1964 to 1971. ==Biography== President Nixon (right) with NASA Administrator James C. Fletcher in January 1972 Star Trek in front of the Space Shuttle Enterprise at the Palmdale manufacturing facility Fletcher was born in Millburn, New Jersey to Harvey Fletcher and Lorena Chipman. His father, Harvey is known as the \\"Father of Stereophonic sound\\". Fletcher earned a bachelor's degree in physics from Columbia College of Columbia University and a Ph.D in physics (1948) from the California Institute of Technology. After holding research and teaching positions at Harvard and Princeton Universities, he joined Hughes Aircraft in 1948 and later worked at the Guided Missile Division of the Ramo-Wooldridge Corporation. In 1958, Fletcher co-founded the Space Electronics Corporation in Glendale, California, which, after a merger, became the Space General Corporation. He was later named systems vice president of the Aerojet General Corporation in Sacramento, California. In 1964, he became president of the University of Utah, a position he held until he was named NASA Administrator by President Richard M. Nixon in 1971. During his first administration at NASA, Fletcher was responsible for beginning the Space Shuttle effort, as well as the Viking program that sent landers to Mars. He oversaw the Skylab missions and approved the Voyager space probes and the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project. When he left NASA in 1977, Fletcher became an independent consultant in McLean, Virginia, and served on the faculty of the University of Pittsburgh. For nine years, he was active as an advisor to key national leaders involved in planning space policy. Among other activities, he served on an advisory board involved in developing the Strategic Defense Initiative. In 1986, President Ronald Reagan selected Fletcher to administer NASA for a second time, to help the agency recover from the Space Shuttle Challenger accident. Shuttle flights went into a two-year hiatus while Fletcher ensured that NASA reinvested heavily in the program's safety and reliability, made organizational changes to improve efficiency, and restructured its management system. He oversaw a complete reworking of the components of the Shuttle to enhance its safety, including a redesign of the solid rocket boosters, and added an egress method for the astronauts. The Space Shuttle returned to flight on September 29, 1988. Fletcher also approved the Hubble Space Telescope program. He served as Administrator until April 8, 1989, into the term of Reagan's successor, President George H. W. Bush. Fletcher died in December 1991 of lung cancer at his home in suburban Washington, DC. He was buried at Salt Lake City Cemetery. He was a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. He was posthumously inducted into the International Space Hall of Fame in 1992. ==References== ==Sources== *Portions of this article are based on public domain text from NASA ==External links== * * Category:1919 births Category:1991 deaths Category:California Institute of Technology alumni Category:Columbia College (New York) alumni Category:Harvard University faculty Category:Princeton University faculty Category:Latter Day Saints from New Jersey Category:Administrators of NASA Category:People from Millburn, New Jersey Category:Presidents of the University of Utah Category:Burials at Salt Lake City Cemetery ","title":"James C.

He is one of the most loved Icelandic poets ‚Äì not least for his verse for children and how beautifully his words flow in the Icelandic language ‚Äì making them ideal for songs. Indeed, his poems have been a constant inspiration for composers, songwriters and musicians in Iceland. More than two hundred songs and compositions have been written based on his poems/lyrics, some even performed by internationally recognised artists such as Bj√∂rk here performing the song about The Christmas Cat. One of the salient figures of modern Icelandic poetry, J√≥hannes mastered both the intricate traditional forms and the modern, but as an outspoken, idealistic and sometimes scathing critic of political institutions, he courted controversy and often drew the ire of political opponents. J√≥hannes began his career as a neo-romantic poet in the 1920s, but later became a leading force among the radical poets of the depression era. After WWII he revolted against the traditional form, renewing his poetry through his originality and artistry. He was a spokesman for peace throughout his life and fought vigorously against Iceland‚Äôs occupation by foreign armies. ==Life== J√≥hannes was born in 1899 at Goddasta√∞ir farmstead, near the head of Hvammsfj√∂r√∞ur in the Dales of Northwestern Iceland. Despite poverty, J√≥hannes was educated and graduated as a primary school teacher in 1921, a profession he practised for more than a decade, first in the countryside and then in Reykjav√≠k. From then on he worked as an editor and an author, first in Reykjav√≠k and then in 1940 when he moved to Hverager√∞i, a small town in the South of Iceland which became known as the Artists Colony in the 1940s. He moved back to Reykjav√≠k in 1959 where he lived from then on. ==Works== In 1932, J√≥hannes √∫r K√∂tlum published his best-loved children's book: J√≥lin koma (Christmas is Coming ‚Äì Verse for Children). One of the poems in the book, \\"The Yuletide-Lads,\\" reintroduced Icelandic society to Yuletide folklore and established what is now considered the canonical thirteen Yuletide-lads or Yule Lads, their personalities and connection to other folkloric characters. Since then Christmas is Coming has been an integral part of Icelandic Christmas traditions and helped preserve age-old folklore in modern culture. A seasonal bestseller from the start, few other books have been reprinted as many times in Iceland. ==Awards and nominations== J√≥hannes received awards for his celebratory verses in the Parliament Millennium Celebrations of 1930 and the Republic of Iceland Festivities in 1944. He was awarded the Silver Horse, the Icelandic Newspapers Literature Award, in 1970. He was nominated twice for the Nordic Council Literature Prize; in 1966 and 1973. ==BibliographyPoetry=== * 1926: B√≠ b√≠ og blaka * 1929: √Ålftirnar kvaka, poems * 1932: √âg l√¶t sem √©g sofi, poems * 1932: J√≥lin koma, poems (for children) - established what is now considered the canonical thirteen Yule Lads * 1933: √ñmmus√∂gur (for children) * 1935: Samt mun √©g vaka * 1937: Hr√≠mhvita m√≥√∞ir * 1939: Hart er √≠ heimi * 1940: Eil√≠f√∞ar sm√°bl√≥m * 1941: Bakkabr√¶√∞ur (for children) * 1945: S√≥l t√©r sortna * 1946: Lj√≥√∞i√∞ um Labbak√∫t (for children) * 1949: Lj√≥√∞asafn I-II selected poems * 1952: S√≥leyjarkv√¶√∞i * 1952: Hli√∞ hins himneska fri√∞ar * 1955: Sj√∂d√¶gra * 1959: V√≠sur Ingu D√≥ru (for children) * 1962: √ìlj√≥√∞ * 1964: Tregaslagur * 1966: Mannssonurinn * 1970: N√Ω og ni√∞ * 1972-76: Lj√≥√∞asafn I-VIII, selected poems * 1984: Lj√≥√∞asafn IX, selected poems * 1987: Saga af Su√∞urnesjum (for children) * 1988: Segja vil √©g s√∂gu af sveinunum √æeim (for children) * 2001: J√≥lin okkar (for children) * 2010: Lj√≥√∞a√∫rval, selected poems ===Novels=== * 1934: Og bj√∂rgin klofnu√∞u * 1943: Verndarenglarnir * 1949: Dau√∞smannsey * 1950: Siglingin mikla * 1951: Frelsis√°lfan ===Stories=== * 1938: Fuglinn segir (for children) ===Essays=== * 1958: Ro√∞asteinninn og ritfrelsi√∞ * 1965: Vinaspegill === Translations === * 1934: Kak I (with Sigur√∞ur Thorlacius) Vilhjalmur Stefansson and Violet Irwin * 1935: Kak II (with Sigur√∞ur Thorlacius) Vilhjalmur Stefansson and Violet Irwin * 1935: Mamma litla I (with Sigur√∞ur Thorlacius) √âlise de Pressens√© * 1936: Mamma litla II (with Sigur√∞ur Thorlacius) √âlise de Pressens√© * 1938: Himalajaf√∂rin (with Sigur√∞ur Thorlacius) Queling * 1946: Salam√∂ndrustr√≠√∞i√∞ Karel ƒåapek * 1946: Fimm synir Howard Fast * 1948: Annarlegar tungur (various selected poets) * 1955: Saga af s√∂nnum manni Boris Nikolaevich Polevoƒ≠ * 1957: Vegurinn til l√≠fsins I Anton Semyonovich Makarenko * 1957: Vegurinn til l√≠fsins II Anton Semyonovich Makarenko * 1958: Fr√∫ L√∫na √≠ sn√∂runni Agnar Mykle ==References== ==External links== *J√≥hannes Bjarni J√≥nasson Encyclop√¶dia Britannica entry * johannes.is - Ritaskr√°r Kotlum, Johannes ur Kotlum, Johannes ur Category:Icelandic poets Category:Icelandic communists Category:20th-century Icelandic people Johannes ur Kotlum ","title":"J√≥hannes √∫r K√∂tlum"},{"id":"524957","text":"Amos Abbott (September 10, 1786, Andover, Massachusetts ‚Äì November 2, 1868, Andover, Massachusetts) was a United States Congressman from Massachusetts.

As of 1996, 25.2% of all independent countries were island countries. Island nations, because of their geography, tend to be significantly more vulnerable to climate change than other nations, in part because of sea level rise, saltwater intrusion, and impacts on food supply. ==Politics== Historically, island countries have been less prone to political instability than their continental counterparts. The percentage of island countries that are democratic is higher than that of continental countries. ==War== Island countries have often been the basis of maritime conquest and historical rivalry between other countries. Island countries are more susceptible to attack by large, continental countries due to their size and dependence on sea and air lines of communication. Many island countries are also vulnerable to predation by mercenaries and other foreign invaders, although their isolation also makes them a difficult target. ==Natural resources== Many developing small island countries rely heavily on fish for their main supply of food. Some are turning to renewable energy--such as wind power, hydropower, geothermal power and biodiesel from copra oil--to defend against potential rises in oil prices. ==Geography== Some island countries are more affected than other countries by climate change, which produces problems such as reduced land use, water scarcity, and sometimes even resettlement issues. Some low-lying island countries are slowly being submerged by the rising water levels of the Pacific Ocean. Climate change also impacts island countries by causing natural disasters such as tropical cyclones, hurricanes, flash floods and drought. === Climate change === ==Economics== Many island countries rely heavily on imports and are greatly affected by changes in the global economy. Due to the nature of island countries their economies are often characterised by being smaller, relatively isolated from world trade and economy, more vulnerable to shipping costs, and more likely to suffer environmental damage to infrastructure; exceptions include Japan and the United Kingdom. The dominant industry for many island countries is tourism. ==Composition== Island countries are typically small with low populations, although some, like Indonesia and Japan are notable exceptions. Some island countries are centred on one or two major islands, such as the United Kingdom, Trinidad and Tobago, New Zealand, Cuba, Bahrain, Singapore, Iceland, Malta, and Taiwan. Others are spread out over hundreds or thousands of smaller islands, such as Indonesia, the Philippines, The Bahamas, Seychelles, and the Maldives. Some island countries share one or more of their islands with other countries, such as the United Kingdom and Ireland; Haiti and the Dominican Republic; and Indonesia, which shares islands with Papua New Guinea, Brunei, East Timor, and Malaysia. Bahrain, Singapore, and the United Kingdom have fixed links such as bridges and tunnels to the continental landmass: Bahrain is linked to Saudi Arabia by the King Fahd Causeway, Singapore to Malaysia by the Johor‚ÄìSingapore Causeway and Second Link, and the United Kingdom has a railway connection to France through the Channel Tunnel. Geographically, the country of Australia is considered a continental landmass rather than an island, covering the largest landmass of the Australian continent. In the past, however, it was considered an island country for tourism purposes (among others) and is sometimes referred to as such. == List == ==See also== *Archipelagic state *Effects of climate change on island nations *Landlocked country *List of Caribbean island countries by population *List of island countries *List of islands by area *List of islands (by country) *List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Oceania *List of sovereign states and dependent territories in the Indian Ocean *Microstate *City state *Pacific Islands Forum *Small Island Developing States *Thalassocracy ==References== Island nation Category:Country classifications is:Eyr√≠ki ","title":"Island country"},{"id":"525001","text":"Aleut islander (19th Century) Alaska Natives or Alaskan Natives are indigenous peoples of Alaska, United States and include: I√±upiat, Yupik, Aleut, Eyak, Tlingit, Haida, Tsimshian, and a number of Northern Athabaskan cultures. They are often defined by their language groups. Many Alaska Natives are enrolled in federally recognized Alaska Native tribal entities, who in turn belong to 13 Alaska Native Regional Corporations, who administer land and financial claims. Ancestors of Alaska Natives migrated into the area thousands of years ago, in at least two different waves. Some are descendants of a third wave of migration in which people settled across the northern part of North America. They never migrated to southern areas. For this reason, genetic studies show they are not closely related to Native Americans in South America. Throughout the Arctic and the circumpolar north, the ancestors of Alaska Natives established varying indigenous, complex cultures that have succeeded each other over time. They developed sophisticated ways to deal with the challenging climate and environment, and cultures rooted in the place. Historic groups have been defined by their languages, which belong to several major language families. Today, Alaska Natives constitute over 15% of the population of Alaska. ==List of peoples== Alaska Native Languages American Indians and Alaska Natives in Alaska. Below is a full list of the different Alaska Native peoples, which are largely defined by their historic languages (within each culture are different tribes): *Ancient Beringian *Alaskan Athabaskans *Ahtna *Deg Hit'an *Dena'ina *Gwich'in *H√§n *Holikachuk *Koyukon *Lower Tanana *Tanacross *Upper Tanana *Upper Kuskokwim (Kolchan) *Eyak *Tlingit *Haida *Tsimshian * Eskimo *I√±upiat, an Inuit group *Yupik *Siberian Yupik *Yup'ik *Cup'ik *Nunivak Cup'ig *Sugpiaq ~ Alutiiq *Chugach Sugpiaq *Koniag Alutiiq *Aleut (Unangan) == Demographics == The Alaska Natives Commission estimated there were about 86,000 Alaska Natives living in Alaska in 1990, with another 17,000 who lived outside Alaska. A 2013 study by the Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development documented over 120,000 Alaska Native people in Alaska. While the majority of Alaska Natives live in small villages or remote regional hubs such as Nome, Dillingham, and Bethel, the percentage who live in urban areas has been increasing. In 2010, 44% lived in urban areas, compared to 38% in the 2000 census. As of 2018, natives constitute 15.4% of the overall Alaskan population. ==History== The modern history of Alaskan natives begins with the arrival of Europeans. Unusual for North America, it was the Russians coming from Siberia in the eighteenth century, who were the first to make contact. British and American traders generally did not reach the area until the nineteenth century, and in some cases missionaries were not active until the twentieth century. ===Russian colonial period=== Arriving from Siberia by ship in the mid-eighteenth century, Russians began to trade with Alaska Natives. New settlements around trading posts were started by Russians, including Russian Orthodox missionaries. These were the first to translate Christian scripture into Native languages. In the 21st century, the numerous congregations of Russian Orthodox Christians in Alaska are generally composed mostly of Alaska Natives. Rather than hunting the marine life, the Russians forced the Aleuts to do the work for them.Taylor, Alan (2001) American Colonies: The Settling of North America Penguin Books, New York p.452 As word spread of the riches in furs to be had, competition among Russian companies increased and they forced the Aleuts into slavery. Catherine the Great, who became Empress in 1763, proclaimed good will toward the Aleut and urged her subjects to treat them fairly. The growing competition between the trading companies, merging into fewer, larger and more powerful corporations, created conflicts that aggravated the relations with the indigenous populations. Over the years, the situation became catastrophic for the natives. As the animal populations declined, the Aleuts, already too dependent on the new barter economy created by the Russian fur trade, were increasingly coerced into taking greater risks in the dangerous waters of the North Pacific to hunt for more otter. As the Shelikhov-Golikov Company and later Russian-American Company developed as a monopoly, it used skirmishes and systematic violence as a tool of colonial exploitation of the indigenous people. When the Aleut revolted and won some victories, the Russians retaliated, killing many and destroying their boats and hunting gear, leaving them no means of survival. The most devastating effects were from disease: during the first two generations (1741/1759-1781/1799 AD) of Russian contact, 80 percent of the Aleut population died from Eurasian infectious diseases. These were then endemic among the Europeans, but the Aleut had no immunity against the new diseases.\\"Aleut History\\", The Aleut Corporation === Impact of colonization === Yupik mother and child on Nunivak Island Geopolitical reasons drove the Tsarist government to expand into Indigenous territory in present-day Alaska, spreading Russian Orthodoxy and consuming the natural resources of the territory along their way. Their movement into these populated areas of Indigenous communities altered the demographic and natural landscape. Historians have suggested that the Russian-American Company exploited Indigenous peoples as a source of inexpensive labour. The fur trade led the Russian American Company to not only use Indigenous populations for labour, but to also use them as hostages to acquire iasak. Iasak, a form of taxation used by the Russians, was a tribute in the form of otter pelts. It was a taxation method the Russians had previously found useful in their early encounter with Indigenous communities of Siberia during the Siberian fur trade. Beaver pelts were also customary to be given to fur traders upon first contact with various communities. The Russian American Company used military force on Indigenous families as they were taken hostage and held until the male community members brought forth furs. Otter furs on Kodiak Island and Aleutian Islands enticed the Russians to start these taxations. Robbery and maltreatment in the form of corporal punishment and the withholding of food was also present upon the arrival of fur traders. Catherine the Great dissolved the giving of tribute in 1799, and instead instituted a mandatory conscription of Indigenous men between the ages of 18 to 50 to become seal hunters strictly for the Russian American Company. Mandatory service of Indigenous men gave the Russian American Company grounds for competition with American and British fur traders. The conscription of mandatory labour separated men from their families and villages, thus altering and breaking down communities. With able-bodied men away on the hunt, villages were left with little protection as only women, children, and the elderly remained behind. In addition to changes that came with conscription, the spread of disease also altered populations of Indigenous communities. Although records kept in the period were scarce, it has been said that 80% of the pre-contact population of the Aleut people were gone by 1800. Relationships between Indigenous women and fur traders increased as Indigenous men were away from villages. This resulted in marriages and children that would come to be known as Creole peoples, children who were Indigenous and Russian. To reduce hostilities with Aleutian communities, it became policy for fur traders to enter into marriage with Indigenous women which also helped grow a strong Creole population in the territory controlled by the Russian American Company. The growth of the Russian Orthodox Church was another important tactic in the colonization and conversion of Indigenous populations. Ioann Veniaminov, who later became Saint Innocent of Alaska, was an important missionary who carried out the Orthodox Church's agenda to Christianize Indigenous populations. The church brought up Creole children following Russian Orthodox Christianity, while the Russian American Company provided an education to them. Creole people were considered to have high levels of loyalty towards the Russian crown and Russian American Company. After completing their education, children were often sent to Russia, where they would study skills such as mapmaking, theology, and military intelligence. ===ANCSA and since (1971 to present)=== A Koyukon in traditional tribal dress In 1971, with the support of Alaska Native leaders such as Emil Notti, Willie Hensley, and Byron Mallot, the U.S. Congress passed the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA), which settled land and financial claims for lands and resources which the Alaska Natives had lost to European-Americans. It provided for the establishment of thirteen Alaska Native Regional Corporations to administer those claims. Similar to the separately defined status of the Canadian Inuit and First Nations in Canada, which are recognized as distinct peoples, in the United States, Alaska Natives are in some respects treated separately by the government from other Native Americans in the United States. This is in part related to their interactions with the U.S. government which occurred in a different historic period than its interactions during the period of westward expansion during the 19th- century. Europeans and Americans did not have sustained encounters with the Alaska Natives until the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, when many were attracted to the region in gold rushes. The Alaska Natives were not allotted individual title in severalty to land under the Dawes Act of 1887 but were instead treated under the Alaska Native Allotment Act of 1906. It was repealed in 1971, following ANSCA, at which time reservations were ended. Another characteristic difference is that Alaska Native tribal governments do not have the power to collect taxes for business transacted on tribal land, per the United States Supreme Court decision in Alaska v. Native Village of Venetie Tribal Government (1998). Except for the Tsimshian, Alaska Natives no longer hold reservations but do control some lands. Under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, Alaska Natives are reserved the right to harvest whales and other marine mammals. ==Subsistence== Gathering of subsistence food continues to be an important economic and cultural activity for many Alaska Natives.Elizabeth Barrett Ristroph, \\"Alaska Tribes' Melting Subsistence Rights,\\" 1 Arizona Journal of Environmental Law & Policy 1, 2010, Available at In Utqiagvik, Alaska in 2005, more than 91 percent of the I√±upiat households which were interviewed still participated in the local subsistence economy, compared with the approximately 33 percent of non-I√±upiat households who used wild resources obtained from hunting, fishing, or gathering.URS CORP., BARROW VILLAGE PROFILE 4.3-6 (2005), available at http://www.north- slope.org/information/comp_plan/BarrowVillageProfile06.pdf But, unlike many tribes in the contiguous United States, Alaska Natives do not have treaties with the United States that protect their subsistence rights, except for the right to harvest whales and other marine mammals.

Outstanding aptitude can be considered \\"talent.\\" An aptitude may be physical or mental. Aptitude is inborn potential to do certain kinds of work whether developed or undeveloped. Ability is developed knowledge, understanding, learnt or acquired abilities (skills) or attitude. The innate nature of aptitude is in contrast to skills and achievement, which represent knowledge or ability that is gained through learning. According to Gladwell (2008) and Colvin (2008), often it is difficult to set apart an outstanding performance due merely to talent or stemming from hard training. Talented people as a rule show high results immediately in few kinds of activity,Multitalented Creative People but often only in a single direction or genre.Greatest Comedic ActorsFamous People in Dramatic Film == Intelligence and aptitude == Aptitude and intelligence quotient are differing but related views of human mental ability. Unlike the original idea of IQ, aptitude often refers to one of the many different characteristics which can be independent of each other, such as aptitude for military flight, air traffic control, or computer programming. This approach measures a variety of separate skills, similar to the theory of multiple intelligences and Cattell‚ÄìHorn‚ÄìCarroll theory and many other modern theories of intelligence. In general, aptitude tests are more likely to be designed and used for career and employment decisions, and intelligence tests are more likely to be used for educational and research purposes. However, there is a great deal of overlap between them, and they often measure the same kinds of abilities. For example, aptitude tests such as the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery measure enough aptitudes that they could also serve as a measure of general intelligence. A single construct such as mental ability is measured with multiple tests. Often, a person's group of test scores will be highly correlated with each other, which makes a single measure useful in many cases. For example, the U.S. Department of Labor's General Learning Ability is determined by combining Verbal, Numerical and Spatial aptitude scores. However, many individuals have skills that are a lot higher or lower than their overall mental ability level. Aptitude subtests are used intra-individually to determine which tasks that individual is more skilled at performing. This information can be useful for determining which job roles are the best fits for employees or applicants. Often, before more rigorous aptitude tests are used, individuals are screened for a basic level of aptitude through a previously-completed process, such as SAT scores, GRE scores, GATE scores, degrees, or other certifications. == Combined aptitude and knowledge tests == Tests that assess learned skills or knowledge are frequently called achievement tests. However, certain tests can assess both types of constructs. An example that leans both ways is the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB), which is given to recruits entering the armed forces of the United States. Another is the SAT, which is designed as a test of aptitude for college in the United States, but has achievement elements. For example, it tests mathematical reasoning, which depends both on mathematical ability and education received in mathematics. Aptitude tests can typically be grouped according to the type of cognitive ability they measure: # Fluid intelligence: the ability to think and reason abstractly, effectively solve problems and think strategically. It is more commonly known as ‚Äòstreet smarts‚Äô or the ability to ‚Äòquickly think on your feet‚Äô. An example of what employers can learn from one's fluid intelligence is one's suitability for the role for which one is applying. # Crystallised intelligence: the ability to learn from past experiences and to apply this learning to work-related situations. Work situations that require crystallised intelligence include producing and analysing written reports, comprehending work instructions, using numbers as a tool to make effective decisions, etc.The Too Many Aptitudes ProblemMultipotentiality: multiple talents, multiple challenges Personal Reflections on Testing == See also == *General Learning Ability *Skill *Spatial visualization ability *Learning disability == References == == Bibliography == * * Category:Skills Category:Educational psychology eu:Gaitasun pt:Habilidade ","title":"Aptitude"},{"id":"525010","text":"A German garden gnome Garden gnomes () are lawn ornament figurines of small humanoid creatures known as gnomes. Traditionally, the figurines depict male dwarfs wearing red pointy hats. Typically, gnomes stand between . A recent trend has introduced miniature gnomes of only a few inches in height. Originating as a decoration for the wealthy in Europe, garden gnomes are now prevalent in gardens and lawns throughout the western world, among all social classes, and often regarded as kitsch. ==GnomesHistory=== In ancient Rome, small stone statues depicting the Greco-Roman fertility god Priapus, also the protector of floors, were frequently placed in Roman gardens. Gnomes as magical creatures were first described during the Renaissance period by Swiss alchemist Paracelsus as \\"diminutive figures two spans in height who did not like to mix with humans\\". During this period, stone \\"grotesques\\", which were typically garishly painted, figurines, were commonly placed in the gardens of the wealthy. Among the figures depicted were ' (Italian for hunchbacks). In particular, Jacques Callot produced 21 versions of ', which he engraved and printed in 1616. ===Pre-twentieth century=== By the late 1700s, gnome-like statues made of wood or porcelain called \\"gnomes\\" became popular household decorations. The area surrounding town of Brienz in Switzerland was known for their production of wooden house dwarfs. In Germany, these garden figurines became conflated with their traditional stories and superstitions about the \\"little folk\\" or dwarfs that they believed helped around the mines and on the farm. The Dresden company Baehr and Maresch had small ceramic statues of dwarfs or \\"little folk\\" in stock as early as 1841, and although the claim has been contested, some credit Baehr and Maresch with the first garden dwarfs (). Replica of Lampy, Charles Isham's 1847 terracotta gnome from Germany. The original is on display at Lamport Hall. Within less than 10 years, statues of dwarfs had spread from the provinces of Saxony and Thuringia across Germany to France and, in 1847, Sir Charles Isham, brought 21 terracotta gnomes manufactured in Germany by Philip Griebel back to Britain where they were called \\"gnomes\\" in English and placed in the gardens of Isham's home, Lamport Hall in Northamptonshire. Nicknamed \\"Lampy\\", the only gnome of the original batch to survive is on display at Lamport Hall and insured for . The manufacture of gnomes spread across Germany, with numerous other large and small manufacturers coming in and out of the business, each having its own particular style of design. From around 1860 onwards, many statues were made in Gr√§fenroda, a town in Thuringia known for its ceramics. Garden gnomes spread to other countries in Europe in the 1840s and became particularly popular in France and Britain. The term \\"garden gnome\\" may originate from the term \\"Gnomen-Figuren\\" (miniature figurines), used in the original German catalogues. ===Twentieth century=== Garden gnomes were further popularized when Sir Frank Crisp, the owner of the second largest collection of garden gnomes in the UK opened his Friar Park, Henley-on-Thames estate to the public at least once a week from 1910-1919. It was here where garden enthusiasts and visitors from around the world perhaps saw garden gnomes for the first time. The reputation of German gnomes declined after World War I, but they became popular again in the 1930s following Disney's animated film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, when more working-class people were able to purchase them. Tom Major-Ball (father of former British prime minister John Major) was the most notable producer at that time with his company Major's Garden Ornaments. World War II and the years following were also hard on the industry, and most producers gave it up then. Garden gnomes saw a resurgence in popularity again in the 1970s with the creation of more humorous types of gnomes. In the 1990s travelling gnome and garden gnome pranks became popular and made national news at times, where people steal a garden gnome from an unknowing person's lawn and then send the owner photos of the gnome as a practical joke before returning it. ===Twenty-first century=== Philip Griebel's descendants are still producing garden gnomes in Germany. , there were an estimated 25 million garden gnomes in Germany. ==Types of garden gnomes== Garden gnomes are typically male, often bearded, usually wear red phrygian caps and often have pipes. They are often shown pursuing leisurely pastimes such as fishing or napping. Gnomes may be made from terracotta clay slip (runny clay) poured into molds. This is allowed to set up and the excess emptied from the centre, leaving a clay shell. The gnome is removed from the mold when firm, allowed to dry and then fired in a kiln until hard. Once cooled, the gnome is painted. More modern gnomes are made from resins and similar materials. Today, many different variations of garden gnomes exist, including humorous ones ranging from the lighthearted biker or barbecuing gnome, to the more dark, such as one stabbed in the back or wearing an executioner's hood. ==In popular culture and politics== Coolmen garden gnomes Gnomes have become controversial in serious gardening circles in the UK, and were for a time banned from the prestigious Chelsea Flower Show, as the organisers claimed that they detract from the garden designs. Gnome enthusiasts accused the organisers of snobbery, as garden gnomes are popular in the gardens of working class and suburban households.

He graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1947. After leaving the Navy in 1954, he earned a Master of Business Administration from Harvard Business School in 1955. == Career == Beggs served as an executive Vice President and director of General Dynamics. He worked with NASA between 1968 and 1969 as an Associate Administrator of the Office of Advanced Research and Technology. He was an Undersecretary of Transportation from 1969 to 1973. He had served in managerial roles for various such corporations as Summa Corporation, General Dynamics, and Westinghouse prior to his work in NASA. ===NASA Administrator=== Beggs was appointed by President Ronald Reagan as NASA Administrator on June 1, 1981, and took office on July 10. He served until December 4, 1985, when he took an indefinite leave of absence due to an indictment for contract fraud related to activities alleged by the United States Department of Defense to have taken place prior to his tenure at NASA. This indictment was later dismissed, and the United States Attorney General apologized to Beggs for any embarrassment. Deputy Administrator William Graham took over as Acting Administrator until the appointment of James C. Fletcher, who had previously served as Administrator between 1971 and 1977, to a second term. Beggs formally resigned on February 26, 1986, in the aftermath of the Challenger disaster. He denied knowledge of the problems related to the disaster, stating that he \\"had no specific concerns with the joint, the O-rings or the putty\\". ==Personal life and death== Beggs married Mary Harrison, and they had five children. After his NASA career Beggs worked as a consultant from his offices in Bethesda, Maryland, and was involved with the NASA Alumni League and the Potomac Institute for Policy Studies.

He was an instructor at the University of Chicago as well as Columbia University, where he received his Ph.D. in Germanic Studies in 1939. Alexander Gode died of cancer in hospital. He was preceded in death by his first wife, Johanna. Gode was survived by two daughters from his first marriage, his second wife Alison, and their two children. ==Interlingua== Gode was involved with the International Auxiliary Language Association (IALA) from 1933 on, sporadically at first. In 1936 the IALA began development of a new international auxiliary language and in 1939 Gode was hired to assist in this work. After Andr√© Martinet was brought in to head the research in 1946, the two men's views came into conflict as Gode thought that Martinet was trying to schematize the new language too much, conflating it with Occidental. Gode saw no need to invent a language, as a product of some a-priori design. Instead, he and the former director of research, Ezra Clark Stillman, wanted to record the international vocabulary that, in their view, already existed. This would be done - and was being done before Martinet - by systematically extracting and modifying words from the existing control languages in such a way that they could be seen as dialects of a common language, with their own specific peculiarities. When Martinet resigned in 1948 over a salary dispute, Gode took up leadership and got full reign in implementing this vision. The result was Interlingua, the dictionary and grammar of which were published in 1951.Gode's Interlingua Manifesto published in 1959 In 1953, the role of IALA was assumed by the Interlingua Division of Science Service, and Gode became the division director. He continued his involvement with Interlingua until his death by translating scientific and medical texts into it. He won awards for this from the American Medical Writers Association and the International Federation of Translators.A history of Interlingua in Interlingua Union Mundial pro Interlingua ==American Translators Association== Gode was one of the founders and first president of the American Translators Association (1960‚Äì1963).

It aired weeknights at 10:22 pm, following The National at 10 pm, and expanding on stories presented on there with in- depth interviews, documentaries, and televised \\"town hall\\" meetings. The division of the 10:00 hour into two entirely separate programs, and the length of each, reflect the separation and political tension between the CBC's then- separate news and public affairs production units.Knowlton Nash, Prime Time at Ten (McClelland & Stewart, 1987), . The program premiered on January 11, 1982.CBC Archives: \\"The Journal: Episode One\\", accessed 4 February 2007 In its first season, it was hosted by Barbara Frum and Mary Lou Finlay, and was the first network news program in the world hosted by two women without a male co- anchor. However, after the first season Frum became the program's sole host, although Finlay remained with the program as a reporter and documentary producer. Frum anchored on her own until her death in 1992. The program was produced for its entire run by Mark Starowicz, who had produced As It Happens for CBC Radio, which also featured Frum. Guest hosts when Frum was absent from The Journal included Bill Cameron, Peter Kent, Keith Morrison, Lyn Whitham and Brian Stewart. Interviews were generally conducted in the early years of the program using a technique known as the double-ender, wherein guests were interviewed earlier in the day on videotape and later presented as live using a split screen. As satellite television technology progressed and became more commonplace, interviews were instead conducted using satellite uplinks. Beginning in the late 1980s, Friday night's edition of The Journal was frequently given over to arts and literature, under the rubric Friday Night Arts. The Friday arts program was anchored by Daniel Richler or David Gilmour. At other times, an entire show‚Äîor even, in one case, an entire week of shows‚Äîwould be devoted to a single topic, usually in the form of the \\"full- edition documentary\\"; documentary topics ranged from the serious (aboriginal land claims and the Oka crisis) to the mundane (a 30-minute expos√© on feet). One of the most memorable documentaries was a two-part travelogue by Allen Abel driving from Budapest to Bucharest two days after the fall of the Ceau≈üescu regime in Romania. The Journal was based on CBC Winnipeg's successful suppertime program, 24Hours. It also bore many similarities in its format to the American program Nightline which premiered three years earlier, in 1979. ==Cancellation== Following Frum's death in 1992, and with plans underway to move their daily news and current affairs hour to 9 pm, the CBC chose to also revamp its entire approach to TV news programming. In the fall of 1992, CBC Prime Time News debuted with Peter Mansbridge and Pamela Wallin as equal cohosts of a package that mixed news and Journal-type features into a single program. That format lasted only two years before reverting to the old National/Journal format, although the name Prime Time News persisted for another year. When the news program returned to the name The National in 1995, the current affairs program became The National Magazine. This subsequently was renamed The Magazine. It was again reintegrated into the first half news program, as The National, in 2001. ==References== Category:1982 Canadian television series debuts Category:1992 Canadian television series endings Category:CBC Television original programming Category:CBC News Category:1980s Canadian television news shows Category:1990s Canadian television news shows ","title":"The Journal (Canadian TV program)"},{"id":"525022","text":"Jesse Crowell (November 19, 1797 Bridgewater, Oneida County, New York ‚Äì September 28, 1872 Albion, Calhoun County, Michigan) was a pioneer settler in Michigan, who platted Albion, Michigan, in 1836, was its first postmaster, and played an important role in the public affairs and the development of Albion. He is renowned as Albion's Greatest Benefactor. ==Life== His parents died when he was young. He removed to Albion, Oswego County, New York. He was a member of the New York State Assembly (Oswego Co.) in 1835. Crowell came to Albion in 1835 with the intention to find water power and build a mill. He found the site at the forks of the Kalamazoo River. Crowell was the main organizer, along with fellow pioneer settlers Tenney Peabody, Issachor Frost and D. L. Bacon, of the Albion Company - a firm which laid the plat for the town in 1836. In 1837, he negotiated for a post office and became the first postmaster. Through the Albion Company, Crowell sold property to other early settlers, donated land to establish churches, and established the Albion Burying Ground - later to become Riverside Cemetery. In 1838, he donated 60 acres (240,000 m¬≤) of land and an additional 3 block for the Wesleyan Female Seminary, which later became Albion College. In its first years, Crowell served on the school's board of directors and contributed liberally to the institution. Crowell operated his Stone Mill from 1845 until his death, exporting products throughout the country. In 1917 this building was converted for use as a bank, removing the upper story, and applying a neoclassical front on the Superior St facade. The south wall of the Stone Mill may still be seen to this day. He never married, he had no children, but gave generously of his time, money, and energy for the building of Albion. Crowell is associated with many places in Albion. Crowell's Michigan Avenue home was purchased by Dr. Stephen Munroe in 1873. A retired physician, Munroe added a mansard roof and third floor to the structure. The family of Albion State Bank president David A. Garfield were the final residents of the house. Mrs. Garfield was the niece of Dr. Munroe. The Garfield's lived there until the house was demolished in 1926 to make way for Wesley Hall, a girls' dormitory for Albion College, later expanded for the use of all Albion College freshmen. Crowell Park is located on North Superior Street. Named Washington Square in the original 1836 plat map and later known as Washington Park, this park was at one time extensively landscaped. Albion's water tower is located on this hill-top location. In the center of the park is the cornerstone from Crowell's stone mill. Crowell School was named in his honor and opened in 1955 in the northwest corner of town. Because of declining student enrollment, this elementary school was converted for use as administrative offices in 2004. Finally, the Crowell Block (303-307 Superior) in the Superior Street National Commercial Historic District downtown (listed on the National Register of Historic Places), was built by Crowell (c.1858) and was part of a row of three story commercial buildings between the Albion Opera House and the Brockway block on the corner of Superior and Erie.

Shown in ‚Äì choline and phosphate group; ‚Äì glycerol; ‚Äì monounsaturated fatty acid; ‚Äì saturated fatty acid. Lecithin (, from the Greek lekithos \\"yolk\\") is a generic term to designate any group of yellow-brownish fatty substances occurring in animal and plant tissues which are amphiphilic ‚Äì they attract both water and fatty substances (and so are both hydrophilic and lipophilic), and are used for smoothing food textures, emulsifying, homogenizing liquid mixtures, and repelling sticking materials. Lecithins are mixtures of glycerophospholipids including phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidic acid. Lecithin was first isolated in 1845 by the French chemist and pharmacist Th√©odore Gobley. In 1850, he named the phosphatidylcholine l√©cithine. Gobley originally isolated lecithin from egg yolk--ŒªŒ≠Œ∫ŒπŒ∏ŒøœÇ lekithos is \\"egg yolk\\" in Ancient Greek--and established the complete chemical formula of phosphatidylcholine in 1874; in between, he had demonstrated the presence of lecithin in a variety of biological matters, including venous blood, in human lungs, bile, human brain tissue, fish eggs, fish roe, and chicken and sheep brain. Lecithin can easily be extracted chemically using solvents such as hexane, ethanol, acetone, petroleum ether or benzene; or extraction can be done mechanically. It is usually available from sources such as egg yolk, marine sources, soybeans, milk, rapeseed, cottonseed, and sunflower oil. It has low solubility in water, but is an excellent emulsifier. In aqueous solution, its phospholipids can form either liposomes, bilayer sheets, micelles, or lamellar structures, depending on hydration and temperature. This results in a type of surfactant that usually is classified as amphipathic. Lecithin is sold as a food additive and dietary supplement. In cooking, it is sometimes used as an emulsifier and to prevent sticking, for example in non-stick cooking spray. ==Production== Commercial lecithin, as used by food manufacturers, is a mixture of phospholipids in oil. The lecithin can be obtained by water degumming the extracted oil of seeds. It is a mixture of various phospholipids, and the composition depends on the origin of the lecithin. A major source of lecithin is soybean oil. Because of the EU requirement to declare additions of allergens in foods, in addition to regulations regarding genetically modified crops, a gradual shift to other sources of lecithin (such as sunflower lecithin) is taking place. The main phospholipids in lecithin from soy and sunflower are phosphatidyl choline, phosphatidyl inositol, phosphatidyl ethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidic acid. They often are abbreviated to PC, PI, PE, PS and PA, respectively. Purified phospholipids are produced by companies commercially. ===Hydrolysed lecithin=== To modify the performance of lecithin to make it suitable for the product to which it is added, it may be hydrolysed enzymatically. In hydrolysed lecithins, a portion of the phospholipids have one fatty acid removed by phospholipase. Such phospholipids are called lysophospholipids. The most commonly used phospholipase is phospholipase A2, which removes the fatty acid at the C2 position of glycerol. Lecithins may also be modified by a process called fractionation. During this process, lecithin is mixed with an alcohol, usually ethanol. Some phospholipids, such as phosphatidylcholine, have good solubility in ethanol, whereas most other phospholipids do not dissolve well in ethanol. The ethanol is separated from the lecithin sludge, after which the ethanol is removed by evaporation to obtain a phosphatidylcholine-enriched lecithin fraction. ===Genetically modified crops as a source of lecithin=== As described above, lecithin is highly processed. Therefore, genetically modified (GM) protein or DNA from the original GM crop from which it is derived often is undetectable - in other words, it is not substantially different from lecithin derived from non-GM crops. Nonetheless, consumer concerns about genetically modified food have extended to highly purified derivatives from GM food, such as lecithin. This concern led to policy and regulatory changes in the EU in 2000, when Commission Regulation (EC) 50/2000 was passed which required labelling of food containing additives derived from GMOs, including lecithin. Because it is nearly impossible to detect the origin of derivatives such as lecithin, the European regulations require those who wish to sell lecithin in Europe to use a meticulous, but essential system of identity preservation (IP). ==Properties and applications== Soy lecithin for sale at a grocery store in Uruguay Lecithins have emulsification and lubricant properties, and are a surfactant. They can be completely metabolized (see inositol) by humans, so are well tolerated by humans and nontoxic when ingested; some other emulsifiers can only be excreted via the kidneys. The major components of commercial soybean- derived lecithin are: * 33‚Äì35% Soybean oil * 20‚Äì21% Phosphatidylinositols * 19‚Äì21% Phosphatidylcholine * 8‚Äì20% Phosphatidylethanolamine * 5‚Äì11% Other phosphatides * 5% Free carbohydrates * 2‚Äì5% Sterols * 1% Moisture Lecithin is used for applications in human food, animal feed, pharmaceuticals, paints, and other industrial applications. Applications include: * In the pharmaceutical industry, it acts as a wetting agent, stabilizing agent and a choline enrichment carrier, helps in emulsification and encapsulation, and is a good dispersing agent. It can be used in manufacture of intravenous fat infusions and for therapeutic use. * In animal feed, it enriches fat and protein and improves pelletization. * In the paint industry, it forms protective coatings for surfaces with painting and printing ink, has antioxidant properties, helps as a rust inhibitor, is a colour-intensifying agent, catalyst, conditioning aid modifier, and dispersing aid; it is a good stabilizing and suspending agent, emulsifier, and wetting agent, helps in maintaining uniform mixture of several pigments, helps in grinding of metal oxide pigments, is a spreading and mixing aid, prevents hard settling of pigments, eliminates foam in water- based paints, and helps in fast dispersion of latex-based paints. * Lecithin also may be used as a release agent for plastics, an antisludge additive in motor lubricants, an antigumming agent in gasoline, and an emulsifier, spreading agent, and antioxidant in textile, rubber, and other industries. ===Food additive=== The nontoxicity of lecithin leads to its use with food, as an additive or in food preparation. It is used commercially in foods requiring a natural emulsifier or lubricant. In confectionery, it reduces viscosity, replaces more expensive ingredients, controls sugar crystallization and the flow properties of chocolate, helps in the homogeneous mixing of ingredients, improves shelf life for some products, and can be used as a coating. In emulsions and fat spreads, such as margarines with a high fat content of more than 75%, it stabilizes emulsions, reduces spattering (splashing and scattering of oil droplets) during frying, improves texture of spreads and flavor release. In doughs and baking, it reduces fat and egg requirements, helps even out distribution of ingredients in dough, stabilizes fermentation, increases volume, protects yeast cells in dough when frozen, and acts as a releasing agent to prevent sticking and simplify cleaning. It improves wetting properties of hydrophilic powders (such as low-fat proteins) and lipophilic powders (such as cocoa powder), controls dust, and helps complete dispersion in water. Lecithin keeps cocoa and cocoa butter in a candy bar from separating. It can be used as a component of cooking sprays to prevent sticking and as a releasing agent. Lecithin is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for human consumption with the status \\"generally recognized as safe\\". Lecithin is admitted by the EU as a food additive, designated as E322. ===Dietary supplement=== Because it contains phosphatidylcholines, lecithin is a source of choline, an essential nutrient. Clinical studies have shown benefit in acne, in improving liver function, and in lowering cholesterol, but older clinical studies in dementia and dyskinesias had found no benefit. An earlier study using a small sample (20 men divided in 3 groups) did not detect statistically significant short term (2‚Äì4 weeks) effects on cholesterol in hyperlipidemic men. La Leche League recommends its use to prevent blocked or plugged milk ducts which can lead to mastitis in breastfeeding women. Egg-derived lecithin is not usually a concern for those allergic to eggs since commercially available egg lecithin is highly purified and devoid of allergy-causing egg proteins.Discussion Forum: American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology Similarly, soy lecithin does not contain enough allergenic proteins for most people allergic to soy, although the US FDA only exempts a few soy lecithin products from its mandatory allergenic source labeling requirements. ===Religious restrictions=== Soy- derived lecithin is considered by some to be kitniyot and prohibited on Passover for Ashkenazi Jews when many grain-based foods are forbidden, but not at other times. This does not necessarily affect Sephardi Jews, who do not have the same restrictions on rice and kitniyot during Passover.(Reb Yehonatan Levy, Shomer Kashrut Mashgiach - based upon halachic rulings of CRC - Chicago Rabbinic Council, and from shiurim/lessons by Rabbi D. Raccah on \\"Pesach Preparations\\" following commentary from former Rishon-LeTzion Rav Ovadia Yosef). OK Kosher Certification, Keeping Kosher for Pesach. Retrieved on September 10, 2008. Muslims are not forbidden to eat lecithin per se; however, since it may be derived from animal as well as plant sources, care must be taken to ensure this source is halal. Lecithin derived from plants and egg yolks is permissible, as is that derived from animals slaughtered according to the rules of dhabihah.Islamic Food and Nutrition Council of America FAQ, IFANCA: Consumer FAQ. Retrieved on July 7, 2010. The practice of consuming Halal products is not widespread among Muslims, the practice is common with Muslims who follow Sharia laws. == Research == Research suggests soy-derived lecithin has significant effects on lowering serum cholesterol and triglycerides, while increasing HDL (\\"good cholesterol\\") levels in the blood of rats. However, a growing body of evidence indicates lecithin is converted by gut bacteria into trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), which is absorbed by the gut and may with time contribute to atherosclerosis and heart attacks.Wendy R Russell WR et al. (2013) Colonic bacterial metabolites and human health (Review). Current Opinion in Microbiology 16(3):246‚Äì254 There is also some preliminary evidence suggesting that excessive consumption of lecithin, either via foodstuffs or supplements, may promote depression in sensitive individuals.pdf. ==See also== *Phytosome == References == == External links == *Introduction to Lecithin (University of Erlangen) *FDA Industry guideline for soy lecithin labeling * Category:Cholinergics Category:Food emulsifiers Category:Phospholipids Category:Membrane biology Category:Nootropics Category:Soy products Category:Zwitterionic surfactants Category:E-number additives ","title":"Lecithin"},{"id":"525024","text":"Joseph Paul Trippi (born June 10, 1956) is an American political strategist who has worked on several gubernatorial, United States Senate, and Congressional campaigns, including Jerry Brown for Governor of California and Doug Jones for U.S. Senate in Alabama. He has worked for several Democratic presidential campaigns, most notably as manager of the Howard Dean 2004 presidential campaign. He currently serves as a political commentator for CNN. == Early life and education == Trippi was born in Jamestown, New York and raised in Los Angeles, California. Trippi began his career in the mid-1970s working on several local elections in San Jose, California while he was attending San Jose State University, before leaving college a few credits shy of graduation to join the Ted Kennedy 1980 presidential campaign. ==Career== Trippi served as Deputy Campaign Manager for Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley's successful reelection bid in 1981 Bradley's unsuccessful run in the 1982 California gubernatorial election. During Bradley's gubernatorial campaign, Trippi installed one of the first in-house computers for a political campaign, the DEC-PDP11. Trippi used it for fundraising and targeting. === National === In 2010, Trippi was a senior strategist and media consultant in Jerry Brown‚Äôs successful run for reelection as California Governor. The Brown ads Trippi & Associates produced received four Pollie awards for excellence in political media and TIME magazine named one ad, \\"Echo,\\" the best ad of 2010. Andrew Romanoff, who challenged the incumbent Senator Michael Bennet in the 2010 Colorado Senate election, announced his campaign had hired Trippi as one of its four new consultants. Trippi worked on a number of recent House victories for Representatives Tulsi Gabbard, Janice Hahn, Mark Takano, and Seth Moulton. Moulton, a former Marine from Massachusetts, won in a shocking come-from- behind upset. The campaign overcame millions in outside spending to beat 18-year incumbent John Tierney in the primary and Richard Tisei in the targeted general election. In a recent article from The Boston Globe, Moulton recalls nationally renowned pollster Mark Mellman telling him to quit the race because it would be \\"statistically impossible\\" to win. In 2017, Trippi worked on the special election to fill the Senate seat vacated by Jeff Sessions on behalf of former US Attorney for the Northern District of Alabama Doug Jones. In his victory speech, Jones referred to Trippi as the \\"greatest political consultant in the world\\". After the historic come from behind victory in Alabama, Trippi worked for Democratic candidates in both of the 2018 United States Senate elections in Mississippi Trippi worked with Howard Sherman for seat currently held by incumbent Roger Wicker, and with former Secretary of Agriculture Mike Espy in the special election for the Senate seat vacated by Thad Cochran who decided to resign for health reasons.In 2018, Trippi worked on the campaign of Janet Garrett, a retired schoolteacher and union leader running to unseat the conservative founder of the Freedom Caucus, U.S. Rep. Jim Jordan, in Ohio's 4th congressional district.https://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2018/06/opponent_jan_garrett_reports_f.html Trippi currently serves as senior adviser to Senator Doug Jones and Senate candidate Teresa Tomlinson. === International === Trippi has also worked on international political campaigns over the years. In 1993, Trippi worked for then-PASOK leader Andreas Papandreou‚Äôs successful campaign of Prime Minister of Greece, as well as for his son, George Papandreou in 2007. Trippi advised former British Prime Minister Tony Blair in 2005. In 2006, he worked for Romano Prodi on his winning race for Prime Minister of Italy. In 2008, Trippi helped Morgan Tsvangirai and Zimbabwe‚Äôs opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change receive the most votes over Robert Mugabe in elections marred by violence. He also brought media attention to Mugabe‚Äôs democratic subversion and violence which led to a unity government and Tsvangarai becoming the Prime Minister of Zimbabwe. As part of the unity government, Tsvangirai designated Roy Bennett as Deputy Minister of Agriculture on February 10, 2009. But Mugabe refused to swear Bennett into office, and three days later Bennett was arrested and charged with treason. Tsvangirai‚Äôs party reported that Bennett was being denied food in prison. Trippi led an international campaign to put pressure on Mugabe to release Bennett, and days after his release on March 12, Bennett thanked Trippi for his efforts. Trippi was hired by the Libertas political party to work on their campaign for the 2009 European Parliament election. In January 2010, Michael Hastings reported that Joe Trippi was working in Iraq to help launch a secular moderate Shiite party: the Ahrar party headed by Iyad Jamal Al-Din. A day later, Hastings also reported that 20 of Ahrar‚Äôs candidates had been struck from the ballot. Beginning in October 2011, Trippi advised on the implementation of the recommendations of the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry, which was tasked with looking into the incidents that occurred during the period of unrest in Bahrain in February and March 2011, saying he \\"had no problem working for them\\" because they were \\"one of the progressive countries in the Middle Eastern Gulf.\\"U.S. not \\"standing idly by\\" in Bahrain - Salon.com The commission released a 500-page report which criticized security forces and provided various conclusions, observations, and recommendations to the government. Trippi ended his work in Bahrain in April 2012. In 2011, Trippi provided strategic support for the campaign of Goodluck Jonathan in the Nigerian presidential election. In 2015, Trippi helped guide the new media strategy for the election of Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan, helping him build a following of over 800,000 Nigerians and leading CNN to declare Jonathan the ‚ÄúFacebook President.‚Äù Trippi served as a senior strategist for Cyril Ramaphosa‚Äôs successful bid for African National Congress President in 2017, leading to Ramaphosa becoming the President of South Africa. ==Political campaigns1984 presidential election=== Trippi remained in California to hold his first and only government position as Lieutenant Governor Leo T. McCarthy's Deputy Chief of Staff, before overseeing several successes in Vice President Walter Mondale‚Äôs 1984 campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. Starting with a come-from-behind victory at the Maine State Convention, Trippi eventually managed operations as the state director in Iowa and Pennsylvania, where Mondale won by 30 and 14 points respectively. ===1984‚Äì88=== Following the Mondale campaign, Trippi joined Senator Ted Kennedy‚Äôs PAC, the Fund for a Democratic Majority, as Deputy Director under Paul Tully. At the time, Bob Shrum was chairman of the committee, but he soon resigned to start the media firm Caddell, Doak and Shrum, taking Trippi with him to be Vice President of the firm. During Trippi‚Äôs tenure at what became Doak and Shrum, the firm worked on several media campaigns for gubernatorial and senatorial candidates including those of Virginia Governor Gerald Baliles, Senator Alan Cranston of California, Senator Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, and Pennsylvania Governor Bob Casey. Shrum has attributed Trippi with conceiving and producing the famous spot on Cranston‚Äôs campaign, \\"Zschau‚Äôs Greatest Hits\\". ===1988 presidential election=== In 1987, Trippi left Doak and Shrum to work on Gary Hart‚Äôs 1988 presidential bid with former colleague Paul Tully as deputy political director, later joining Dick Gephardt's team as deputy campaign manager after Hart withdrew from the race. There, Trippi was instrumental in the creation of the \\"Hyundai\\" ad, a television spot which received praise for launching Gephardt from last place in the polls to winning the Iowa caucuses. ===1992 presidential election=== During the 1992 election cycle, Trippi consulted on the Presidential campaigns of Governor Douglas Wilder of Virginia and Jerry Brown of California. For Brown's campaign, Trippi and colleague Joe Costello orchestrated the first successful use of an 800 number in politics, raising $8 million by advertising the number on television and during debates. ===1992‚Äì2004=== Throughout the rest of the 1990s, Trippi worked as a media consultant and producer for multiple successful congressional races, including Ron Wyden‚Äôs run for Oregon's Senate seat, Jim Moran's in Virginia‚Äôs 8th district, and Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky's in Pennsylvania‚Äôs 13th district, which had been held by a Republican for almost 90 years. In 2002, when five Democratic congressmen were redistricted into Republican majority districts and forced in contests against Republican incumbents, Trippi worked as a strategist and media consultant for Congressman Tim Holden, the only one of the five to win. ===2004 presidential election=== As national campaign manager for Vermont Governor Howard Dean‚Äôs presidential campaign in 2004, Trippi used online technology to organize what he envisioned would become \\"the largest grassroots movement\\" in presidential politics at the time. One of these methods included the blog entitled Blog for America where the campaign could communicate directly with supporters. Another was DeanTV, an online streaming platform playing videos and clips from the campaign trail. The campaign also developed technology for a social media site that enabled supporters to connect and campaign for Dean together. Through this innovative use of the Internet for small-donor fundraising, \\"Dean for America\\" raised more money than any Democratic presidential campaign to that point ‚Äì all with donations averaging less than $100. ===2004‚Äì2017=== Trippi discussing technology and civic engagement in 2014 at a 25th anniversary celebration of George H.W. Bush's presidency Trippi joined Jerry Brown again in 2006 serving as media consultant and strategist for his successful bid for California Attorney General. During this cycle he also produced the media for John Hall‚Äôs winning campaign for New York‚Äôs 19th district congressional seat. John Edwards hired Trippi in 2007 as a senior adviser for his 2008 presidential campaign. He also worked as media strategist and a senior adviser for Doug Jones' successful campaign in the 2017 U.S. Senate special election in Alabama, running for the seat left open when Jeff Sessions was appointed as Attorney General. ==Other work and advocacy== Apart from campaign politics, Trippi has been involved in many other facets of the political world. He was named a fellow at the Harvard Institute of Politics and at the New Politics Institute, a think tank of the New Democrat Network. He also serves on the advisory board to nonpartisan organization Why Tuesday? that encourages increased voter participation. He founded the consultancies Trippi & Associates and Trippi International in 2004. He has had roles on various cable and broadcast networks, previously as a contributor on MSNBC and Fox News, and a political analyst on CBS News.

The chief editor of the book was Scott Dikkers, with specific sections edited by Robert D. Siegel, Maria Schneider and John Krewson. It was awarded the 1999 Thurber Prize for American Humor. The book, spun off from The Onion weekly-newspaper format of dryly satirizing current events, features mocked-up newspaper front pages from the entire 20th century, presented as though The Onion had been continuously in print since before 1900. The publication of the book is in itself a parody of other end of the century retrospectives that had been published in 1999, notably Time magazine and The New York Times. ==Summary== The book satirizes many common beliefs, trends, and perceptions. For instance, in response to the John F. Kennedy assassination theories, one headline declares, \\"Kennedy Slain By CIA, Mafia, Castro, LBJ, Teamsters, Freemasons\\" and that he was shot \\"129 times from 43 different angles.\\" \\"Kennedy Slain By...\\", http://www.theonion.com/articles/november-22-1963,10584/, retrieved 10/18/07 This is later followed up by an article proclaiming that the \\"Warren Commission admits to killing JFK.\\" The book often takes a cynical look at American foreign policy over the ages, describing past events with revisionist, modern-day perspectives. For example, the Pearl Harbor attacks are described as being an attack on a \\"colonially-occupied US non-state\\" and President Woodrow Wilson encourages Americans to fight in World War I in order to \\"make the world safe for corporate oligarchy.\\" The article on the 1920 granting of women's suffrage states \\"Women Finally Allowed to Participate in Meaningless Fiction of Democracy.\\" The article on the beginning of World War II is \\"WA- (headline continued on page 2),\\" with \\"WA-\\" in especially large print. Articles on major historical events are often preceded by ironic articles criticizing the irresponsibility that led to such events: For example, an issue dated a week before the 1929 crash of the American stock market heralds the market as \\"invincible\\" and urges readers to \\"put everything they have into the stock market\\". In similar fashion, an issue that precedes one announcing the outbreak of World War I shows Archduke Franz Ferdinand (whose assassination sparked the war) declaring that \\"no man can stop [him]\\". Smaller stories in the book satirize social and pop-cultural trends of their respective eras, such as the faux-advertisements and gimmicks that abound in the top and bottom corners of the pages. For example, from the 1920s: No, No, Nanette Fever Bonus! Sheet Music from \\"Tea for Two\\" Inside. Since the book was written before the year 2000, its prediction for that year satirized Y2K and religious prophecies, including \\"Christian Right Ascends to Heaven,\\" \\"All Corporations Merged Into OmniCorp,\\" and a small graphic listing meteors headed for Earth by size. ==Running gags== There are a number of running gags through this supposed history of the twentieth century, which are not immediately apparent. One is the existence of a piece of farmyard equipment called 'The Chicken Raper'. Another is that every major celebrity trial, from Fatty Arbuckle to O.J. Simpson, is referred to as \\"the trial of the century.\\" A third is the newspaper fear-mongering by drawing a caricature of America's enemy du jour (among them, Spaniards, Nazis, and hippies) sexually assaulting the Statue of Liberty. Three consecutive pages show a fictionalized end to Richard Nixon's presidency which loosely parallels the end of Gary Tison's life: First Nixon is arrested for his connection to the Watergate scandal; the next week's headline says he then escaped and is on the run; the third says he was gunned down in a shootout with cops (but Spiro Agnew is still at large). A more subtle satire is the rise of a (fictional) company called 'Global Tetrahedron', which first appears as a small business in the first decade of the century and gradually grows into a multinational behemoth. Publisher Emeritus, T. Herman Zweibel, writes frequent editorials, growing more and more erratic until he's removed from power by the board of directors in the 1950s. Article titles from 1905 and from 2000 both read 'Arabs, Jews Forge New Age of Peace.' ==Cultural references== Several events from the classic film It's a Wonderful Life are also used as stories, such as the Bedford Falls High School class drowning in a \\"jitterbugging accident\\", \\"Mr. Potter To Pay Fifty Cents on the Dollar\\" during the Great Depression and \\"Harry Bailey Wins Congressional Medal of Honor\\" in the World War II section, with Harry S. Truman quoted in the latter story as saying \\"we owe a great debt to George Bailey for pulling Harry out of the ice when he was 9\\" and saying George was declared 4-F because of his ear. Eventually, in the 1980s, George Bailey is indicted as part of the Savings and Loan scandal. Also present is the frequent theme of moral outrage at the amount of sex in popular culture, beginning with a depiction of women's undergarments reproduced from a Sears catalogue, then extending to jazz music (also thought to have sunk the Titanic), Clara Bow appearing sleeveless in a film, and culminating in \\"Hippies Celebrate Fuck Summer '67\\". The space race is repeatedly covered, including such articles as \\"Bleeping Two-Foot Tin Ball Threatens Free World\\" about the Sputnik launch, \\"Soviets Ahead in Dog-Killing Race\\" about the flight of experimental animals, and finally \\"Holy Shit, Man Walks on Fucking Moon\\", a recreation of the Apollo 11 landing, complete with a radio transcript filled with profanity. ==Critical reaction== The book became a number one New York Times best-seller shortly after its publication on April 1, 1999. ==Other formats== An audio version of the book was produced by Scott Dikkers and adapted by Tim Harrod, and was presented as excerpts from the (real-life) nationally syndicated The Onion Radio News throughout the same time period and covering many of the same subjects. ==See also== * Our Dumb World ==References== Category:1999 non- fiction books Category:Parody books Category:The Onion ","title":"Our Dumb Century"},{"id":"525039","text":"Robert Alan Frosch FREng (born May 22, 1928), is an American scientist who was the fifth administrator of NASA from 1977 to 1981 during the Carter administration. ==Biography== Born in New York City, Frosch was educated in the public school system in The Bronx. He earned undergraduate and graduate degrees in theoretical physics at Columbia University. Between September 1951 and August 1963, Frosch worked as a research scientist and director of research programs for Hudson Laboratories of Columbia University in Dobbs Ferry, New York, an organization under contract to the Office of Naval Research. Until 1953, he worked on problems in underwater sound, sonar, oceanography, marine geology, and marine geophysics. Frosch was first associate and then director of the laboratories, where he managed 300 employees, two ocean-going research vessels, and a $3.5 million annual budget for fundamental research and engineering. During this period he was also Technical Director of Project Artemis, a very large experimental active sonar system development. In September 1963, Frosch went to Washington, DC to work with the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) in the U.S. Department of Defense, serving as Director for Nuclear Test Detection (Project VELA), and then as deputy director of the Advanced Research Projects Agency, sharing responsibility for managing a $270 million per year program of research and development. In July 1966 he became Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research and Development, responsible for all Navy programs of research, development, engineering, test and evaluation averaging $2.5 billion annually.

The headquarters of the district is Erode. It is divided into two revenue divisions, Erode and Gobichettipalayam, and is further subdivided into 10 taluks. Erode District, then known as, was a part of Coimbatore District before its division into two on 17 September 1979. It covers an area of , and as of 2011, had a population of 2,251,744 . ==History== The region belonging to present-day Erode District was ruled successively by several South Indian dynasties, including the Cheras, Cholas and Pandyas. During the first millennium, it was under the rule of the Chera Dynasty and various other rulers. Between the 10th to 12th centuries, the region was part of the larger Chola Empire. The region became part of Vijayanagara empire in the 14th century, then under the Nayaks of Madurai until the 17th century. Under the Madurai Nayaks, the Polygar system of administration was established. The Polygar system continued after the region became part of the Kingdom of Mysore in the mid-17th century. The Polygar chieftain Dheeran Chinnamalai, a governor of the region, played a major role in the early struggle for Indian Independence in the late 18th-century Polygar Wars against the British East India Company. After the Polygar and Mysore Wars in the late 18th century, the area came under the control of the British until the achievement of Indian independence in 1947. It was a part of the erstwhile Coimbatore district until its split in 1979. ==Demographics== According to the 2011 census, Erode District had a population of 2,251,744 with a sex-ratio of 993 females for every 1,000 males, above the national average of 929. A total of 195,213 were under the age of six, constituting 99,943 males and 95,270 females. Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes accounted for 16.41% and 0.97% of the population, respectively. The literacy rate of the district was 66.29%, compared to the national average of 72.99%. The district had a total of 658,071 households. There were 1,195,773 workers: 173,376 cultivators, 331,414 main agricultural labourers, 48,960 in household industries, 557,301 other workers, 84,722 marginal workers, 38,798 marginal agricultural labourers, 5,362 marginal workers in household industries, 4,794 marginal cultivators and 35,768 other marginal workers. ==Geography== Map of Erode region during 1955 To the north of Erode District lies Chamarajanagar district in Karnataka State. To the east, across the Kaveri River, lies Salem and Namakkal districts. To the southeast lies Karur district. Tirupur District lies immediately to the south. Coimbatore and Nilgiris districts lie to the west. Erode District is landlocked, and is situated at between latitude 10 36\\" and 11 58\\" north and between longitude 76 49\\" and 77 58\\" east. The district forms the meeting point of the Western Ghats and Eastern Ghats mountain ranges, separated by the Bhavani River. The district comprises a long undulating plain, sloping gently towards the Kaveri River in the south-east. The three major tributaries of the Kaveri, the Bhavani, Noyyal and Amaravati, run across the long stretch of mountains in the north. In combination with these rivers, numerous canals, the Bhavanisagar Dam and the Kodiveri Dam provide irrigation and drainage for Erode. Bhavanisagar Dam across Bhavani River Kaveri River at Erode === Bhavani River === The Bhavani River rises in the Western Ghats of the Silent Valley National Park in the Palakkad District of Kerala. It is joined by the Siruvani River, a perennial stream of Coimbatore District, and is joined by the Kundha River before entering Erode District in Sathyamangalam. The Bhavani is perennial river, mostly fed by the southwest monsoon but also supplemented by the northeast monsoon. It runs for over one hundred miles through Erode District, crossing Bhavani and Gobichettipalayam taluks. Near Gobichettipalayam lies the Kodiveri Dam, a mini-dam constructed for agricultural purposes. The river eventually feeds the Bhavanisagar reservoir, and then takes an easterly course after crossing Sathyamangalam taluk. Along with another tributary, the Amutha Nathi River, the Bhavani River ultimately joins the Kaveri River in Bhavani, Tamil Nadu. A confluence of three rivers, such as this one, is known as a Triveni Sangam in Hindu belief. The place where the Bhavani River joins with the Kaveri River is famous for the Sri Sangameshwara Temple of Lord Shiva, where, in accordance to Hindu customs, people perform the last rites for deceased friends and family. === Kaveri River === The Kaveri River rises in the Western Ghats of Kodagu (Coorg) District in Karnataka, and is joined by many small tributaries. It runs eastward through Karnataka, and is joined by its main tributary, the Kabini River, before taking a sharp southbound turn at Hogenakkal Falls. From here, it runs towards the southeast, forming the boundary between Bhavani taluk of Erode District and Tiruchengode taluk of the neighbouring Namakkal District. The Bhavani River joins the Kaveri River at the town of Bhavani. ==Climate== Western Ghats as seen from Gobichettipalayam Unlike nearby Coimbatore District, Erode District's climate is characterized by dry weather throughout the year, except during the monsoons, when it receives high rainfall. The cool, moist wind that passes through the Palghat Gap in the Western Ghats has a moderating effect on the climate of neighbouring Coimbatore district, but the air loses its coolness and becomes dry by the time it reaches Erode. Generally, the first two months of the year are pleasant, but in March the temperature begins to rise, which persists until the end of May, when the highest temperatures are normally recorded. The few rain showers during this period do not provide much relief from the heat. However, the temperature reverses its rising trend during the pre-monsoon period, between June and August. By September, the monsoon rains begin to fall. The northeast monsoon sets in vigorously during October‚ÄìNovember. By December, the rains end, returning the climate to its dry and cold state. ==Administration== Erode District Collector's Office For administrative purposes, Erode District is divided into ten taluks under two revenue divisions. * Erode division : Erode taluk, Kodumudi taluk, Modakurichi taluk, Perundurai taluk * Gobichettipalayam division : Anthiyur taluk, Bhavani taluk, Gobichettipalayam taluk, Sathyamangalam taluk, Nambiyur taluk, Thalavadi taluk Erode District consists of one municipal corporation and four other municipalities: * Erode Municipal Corporation * Gobichettipalayam Selection Grade Municipality * Sathyamangalam Grade-I municipality * Bhavani Grade-II municipality * Punjai Puliampatti Grade-II municipality ==Politics== Erode District is divided into 3 Parliamentary Constituencies of the Lok Sabha: Erode, Nilgiris and Tirupur. The district consists of eight Assembly Constituencies of the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly: Anthiyur, Bhavani, Bhavani Sagar, Erode East, Erode West, Gobichettipalayam, Modakurichi and Perundurai. ==Economy== Paddy fields near Gobichettipalayam rugs made in Erode are famous Agriculture is the most important source of income in Erode District. Paddy, plantain, silk, cotton, turmeric, coconut and sugarcane are some of the major products from agriculture and its associated industries. Erode is the top turmeric producer in Tamil Nadu, making up 43% of statewide production. Erode is an important market centre for turmeric, being known as \\"Turmeric City.\\" March 2019, turmeric from Erode received a Geographical Indication tag from the Geographical Indication Registry, making Erode Manjal Vanigarkal Matrum Kidangu Urimaiyalargal Sangam the registered proprietors of the Geographical Indication Erode Manjal (Erode Turmeric). Erode is also the leading producer of plantain, coconuts and white silk in Tamil Nadu. Gobichettipalayam is well known for its white silk, cotton, plantain and coconut production. Erode is one of the major producers of food products in the state. The country's first automated silk reeling unit is located near Gobichettipalayam. Erode (city), Bhavani and Chennimalai are well known for handloom and powerloom textile products and ready-made garments. In 2005, Bhavani Jamakkalam (Bhavani Bedsheets) was registered as a Geographical Indication. Anthiyur and Modachur (Gobichettipalayam) towns are famous for cattle. ==Transport== Erode Junction railway station Meenakshi Sundaranar Salai in Erode NH 544 Bypass near Chithode The transportation system in Erode is well-developed. Erode, being a prominent trading center in Tamil Nadu, is well-connected with all modern means of transport, except air transport. The district is accessible by both road and rail from the state capital Chennai and other major cities. The district is divided into four Regional Transport Office (RTO) sub-divisions, namely Erode East (TN 33), Gobichettipalayam (TN 36), Perundurai (TN 56) and Erode West (TN 86). Gobichettipalayam RTO has two sub-offices, namely Bhavani (TN 36W) and Sathyamangalam (TN 36Z). ===Railways=== The district has one major railway station, Erode Junction. It was built by the British to connect the western and eastern coasts of India. There are ISO-certified diesel and electric locomotive sheds at Erode Junction. Erode Junction, which has the distinction of being the third cleanest railway junction in India, serves as the hub for water filling facilities and food provisions. ===Roadways=== The district is well-connected by road. The following is a list of major arterial roads: National Highways * NH-544 connecting Salem ‚Äì Coimbatore ‚Äì Cochin ‚Äì Kanyakumari passes via Bhavani, Chithode and Perundurai * NH-948 connecting Bangalore ‚Äì Coimbatore passes via Sathyamangalam *NH-544H connecting Erode ‚Äì Bhavani ‚Äì Mettur Dam ‚Äì Thoppur * NH 381A connects Vellakoil on NH-81 with Erode and further to Sankagiri on NH-544.

The State Express Bus Corporation (SETC) operates express bus services from Erode and Gobichettipalayam to major cities across the state. Erode Central Bus Terminus, which serves as a major hub, is one of the largest in the state. Due to its proximity to the states Karnataka and Kerala, Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation and Kerala State Road Transport Corporation buses also operate in the district. ===Airways=== The nearest airport is the Coimbatore International Airport located in the nearby Coimbatore district. ===Waterways=== Navigable waterways are available in the district at Nerinjipettai and Nattatreeswarar Temple. ==Communication== The district is served by extensive postal, telegraph and telephone networks. The district is divided into two postal divisions, namely Erode and Gobichettipalayam. There are three head post offices at Erode, Bhavani and Gobichettipalayam, in addition to 319 other post offices. The district is serviced by almost all leading mobile phone operators in India. ==Education== Erode district has several facilities for higher education,The district is divided into two educational districts, Gobichettipalayam and Erode. Former Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu Dr.M.G.Ramachandran started IRT Perundurai Medical College which is now renamed as Erode Medical College at Perundurai and an Engineering College \\"Institute of Road and Transport Technology\\" as the Automobile Research oriented Institute for the welfare of workers of Tamil Nadu State Transport Coorporation in 1984. IRTT is one of the top 10 Government Engineering Colleges in Tamil Nadu.

It is part of the Skagerrak strait, connecting the North Sea and the Kattegat sea area, which leads to the Baltic Sea. The Oslofjord is not a fjord in the geological sense ‚Äî in Norwegian the term can refer to a wide range of waterways. The bay is divided into the inner () and outer () Oslofjord at the point of the Dr√∏bak Sound. Summer houses in the Oslofjord ==Name== In the period 1624‚Äì1925 the name of the fjord was (or ), since Christiania was the name of the capital in this period. The old Norse name of the fjord was , giving names to the counties of Vestfold ('the district west of Fold') and √òstfold ('the district east of Fold') ‚Äî and also the district Follo. ==Geography== Each of the islands in the innermost part of the fjord has its own identity and distinguishing history. Among them are Hoved√∏ya, Lind√∏ya, Nakholmen, Bleik√∏ya, Gressholmen, and Lang√∏yene. These islands can be reached with the Oslo-boats from Aker Brygge. Hoved√∏ya contains monastery ruins, Gressholmen for its rabbits, Nakholmen, Bleik√∏ya, Lind√∏ya for their cosy cabins at the water's edge, and finally Lang√∏yene for its camping possibilities and beach. The inner part of the Oslofjord has steep and forest covered hill slopes down towards the fjord. ===Climate=== Satellite image by Sentinel-2 The Oslofjord has Norway's highest all year temperature: 7.5 degrees Celsius. February is the coldest month in the fjord with -1.3 degrees Celsius, while July normally has 17.2 degrees Celsius. The islands in the middle of the fjord are among Norway's warmest with high summer temperatures and moderate winters. Oslofjord's relatively high temperatures enable various flora to flourish. ==History== The oldest settlements in the area surrounding the Oslofjord date from the Stone Age and the Bronze Age. It was here on the eastern and western shores that three of the best preserved Viking ships were unearthed. In historical times, this bay was known by the current name of the region, Viken (the bay). Oslofjord has been an important body of water strategically due to its proximity to Oslo. During WWII, there were German installations at several points on its coastline. One installation in Hoved√∏ya held 1,100 Wehrmacht soldiers and later women deemed Nazi collaborators at the National Internment Camp for Women in Hoved√∏ya. Norwegian painter Edvard Munch had a cottage and studio in √Ösg√•rdstrand on the fjord and the Oslofjord appears in several of his paintings, including The Scream and Girls on the Pier. ==Second World War== German cruiser Bl√ºcher The fjord was the scene of a key event in the German invasion of Norway in April 1940, the Battle of Dr√∏bak Sound. The invasion plan envisaged landing of 1,000 troops transported by ship to Oslo. Colonel Eriksen, Commander of the Oscarsborg fortress near Dr√∏bak, mainly maintained for historical purposes, sank the German heavy cruiser Bl√ºcher in the Dr√∏bak narrows. The fortress's resistance blocked the route to Oslo, thus delaying the rest of the invading group long enough for the Norwegian royal family, government, parliament, and national treasury to evacuate. Thus Norway never surrendered to the Germans, leaving the Quisling government illegitimate and permitting Norway to participate as an ally in the war, rather than as a conquered nation. False-colour image of middle parts of Oslofjorden. North is to the left ==Demographics== The entire population situated around the Oslofjord including Oslo is about 1.96 million, and the total population of all the counties situated around the fjord is approximately 2.2 million. More than 40% of Norway's population resides under 45 minutes of driving from the Oslofjord. The Oslofjord has Norway's busiest traffic of ferries and cargo boats. Although the Oslofjord contains hundreds of populated islands, most of the population of the fjord resides on the mainland. ==Recreation== In the summer there are boats of all sizes on the fjord, and it is possible to go kayaking, canoeing, fishing, and sailing. The Oslofjord is one of the nine venues of the Class 1 World Powerboat Championship. ==Image gallery== File:Oslofjord Holmenkollen 2008.jpgOslofjord seen from Holmenkollen.

It was commonplace in such news programs as The Journal on CBC Television. It worked as follows: an interviewer, usually in a television studio, would be videotaped conducting an interview via a long-distance phone call to the interviewee in another part of the world. This interviewee, often in a studio in front of a background representing the city in which he was, would be videotaped as he was being interviewed. This videotape would then be sent to the interviewer's city and synchronized with the videotape of the interviewer. Cuts between shots of the interviewer and interviewee would be made accordingly, and the higher-quality sound of the videotapes would be used instead of the telephone audio. For effect, the interviewer might have been taped looking into a bluescreen or greenscreen, into which the video of the interviewee would at this point be resized if necessary and inserted using chroma key. The double-ender technique has become much less commonplace with the proliferation of live satellite television feeds and video over Internet (Skype, etc.), but is still used today when such technology is not available. The double-ender technique can also be done with audio-only mediums, such as radio or podcasting.

This species is mostly white, with a reddish-pink face and forehead, and has a long, pale beak, which is used to dig for roots and seeds. It has reddish-pink feathers on the breast and belly. ==Taxonomy== The long-billed corella is a monotypic species. The first formal written description was by German naturalist Heinrich Kuhl in 1820 (obviously the First Nations peoples knew of it long before then). It is one of several related species of cockatoos called corellas and classified in the subgenus Licmetis within the genus Cacatua, members of which are known as \\"white cockatoos\\". == Description == The adult long-billed corella measures from 38 to 41 cm in length,Birds in Backyards - Long-billed Corella has a wingspan around 80-90 cm, and averages 567 g in weight. It has a long, bone-coloured beak, and a rim of featherless, bluish skin around the eyes. The plumage is predominantly white with reddish feathers around the eyes and lores. The underside of the wings and tail feathers are tinged with yellow. == Distribution and habitat == The long-billed corella can be found in the wild in Victoria and southeastern New South Wales. It has extended its range in the past 20 years and can now be found in Tasmania, Adelaide and southeast Queensland. A feral population resides in Perth which has implications, as this species may hybridize with the endangered western corella. The long- billed corella is found in grassy woodlands and grasslands, including pasture, fields of agricultural crop, and urban parks. == Ecology and behaviour == Feral parrots in Perth: The bird on the right is using its long beak to dig for food in short grass. Wild bird in a coachwood/native daphne rainforest at Ourimbah, NSW === Call === The call of the long-billed corella is a quick, quavering, falsetto !, ', or ' combined with harsh screeches. === Breeding === Breeding generally takes place from July to November. Long-billed corellas form monogamous pairs and both sexes share the task of building the nest, incubating the eggs, and caring for the young. Nests are made in decayed debris, the hollows of large old eucalypts, and occasionally in the cavities of loose gravely cliffs. 2-3 dull white, oval eggs are laid on a lining of decayed wood. The incubation period is around 24 days and chicks spend about 56 days in the nest. === Feeding === The long-billed corella typically digs for roots, seeds, corms, and bulbs, especially from the weed onion grass. Native plants eaten include murnong Microseris lanceolata, but a substantial portion of the bird's diet now includes introduced plants. They also eat sunflower seeds. ==Relationship with humans As pets === Many feeding in Melbourne, Australia Long-billed corellas are now popular as pets in many parts of Australia, although they were formerly uncommon, and their captive population has stabilised in the last decade. This may be due to their ability to mimic words and whole sentences to near perfection. The long-billed corella has been labeled the best \\"talker\\" of the Australian cockatoos, and possibly of all native Psittacines. === As pests === Long-billed corellas are viewed as agricultural pests, particularly in western Victoria and Western Australia. They can create significant crop damage and are also well known for tearing up pieces of asphalt along roadsides and even damaging power lines. Permits are regularly issued in Western Australia and sometimes issued in Victoria for the culling of this species. Within NSW, the corellas are the most common pest among sporting fields and golf courses, as they can dig holes in the ground up to 3 in across and 6 in deep. In July 2019, in a scene that was said to resemble a \\"horror movie\\", about 60 corellas in Adelaide, South Australia, died in a suspected case of poisoning, after \\"falling from the sky\\", bleeding from their mouths, and wailing. At least 57 of the birds were long-billed corellas, and a few of them were short-billed corellas. It was hoped that whoever poisoned them would get traced after doing a report on toxicology, which could nevertheless take several weeks to complete, because in Australia, people were required to register if they purchase poisons, according to Sarah King, founder of Casper's Bird Rescue, who witnessed the deaths, and also said that the type of poison was a slow one that takes several weeks to work. Additionally, the local Alexandrina council had beforehand called for short- billed corellas to be culled for damaging crops and chewing on streetlights, damaging built infrastructure such as buildings and sporting equipment, and displacing other native species of birds and bees, possums, and other organisms. ==References== ==External links== long-billed corella Category:Birds of New South Wales Category:Birds of Victoria (Australia) Category:Endemic birds of Australia Category:Talking birds long-billed corella ","title":"Long-billed corella"},{"id":"525061","text":"Markeaton is a suburban village within Derby in the East Midlands of England.

Derby: Breedon Books After the Norman conquest the manor of Markeaton which had been held by the Anglo-Saxon Siward, the Fairbairn Earl of Northumbria, was given to Hugh d'Avranches, 1st Earl of Chester, along with chevinetum, Mackworth and Allestree. It finally passed to John the Earl of Huntingdon and Cambridge who died in 1237, his only heirs being his sisters. To prevent the estate passing to women, it was bought by the Crown in 1246. It was held by various members of the Royal family, including the Black Prince until his death in 1376 when it returned to the Crown.Turbutt, G., (1999) A History of Derbyshire.

The village land was enclosed by the Mundys during the 18th century, forcing many of the villagers to move their homes (literally \\"Up Sticks\\") outside the enclosed land. ==Markeaton Hall== A grand house, Markeaton Hall was built in a traditional half timbered style, this was replaced by a new hall during the late 18th century. In 1929, the Markeaton Hall and twenty acres (81,000 m¬≤) of its gardens were given to the Corporation of Derby by the Reverend Clarke Maxwell who had inherited the estate from the late Mrs Mundy, on condition that the whole area would be used as a public park and that the mansion would be maintained for cultural purposes, for example a museum or and art gallery. Unfortunately the hall was used by the Army during World War II and allowed to fall into disrepair after the war. The Council had continually neglected the building, which eventually was declared to be unsafe. The council decided to demolish it, leaving only the Orangery and stable yards. ==The Church== Markeaton shares its church with the nearby village of Mackworth. This 13th-century church was fortified, one of the rare examples of such a church, to protect the villagers and their farm stock from raids by the Meynells, who lived at Langley Meynell. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Areas of Derby Category:Villages in Derbyshire Category:Former civil parishes in Derbyshire ","title":"Markeaton"},{"id":"525062","text":"The Jo≈æef Stefan Institute (IJS) () is the largest research institute in Slovenia.

It is meant to protect the batter's head from errant pitches thrown by the pitcher. A batter who is \\"hit by pitch,\\" due to an inadvertent wild pitch or a pitcher's purposeful attempt to hit him, may be seriously, even fatally, injured. ==Early concepts (1905‚Äì1920s)== In 1905, Mogridge\\"Baseball Batting Helmets - A History\\" Sports Safety Blog, September 2009 created the first crude protective head gear and was granted patent No. 780899 for a \\"head protector.\\" This first attempt at a batting helmet was said to look like an \\"inflatable boxing glove that wrapped around the hitters head.\\"\\"Searching for the History of the Batting Helmet\\" Wezen Ball - A Baseball Blog, March 2011 Roger Bresnahan, Hall of Fame catcher who was injured after being struck in the head with a pitch, developed a leather-batting helmet in 1908 which he began using. The helmets were not so much helmets as they were protective earmuffs. They did not protect the actual head of the batter but rather protected the ear and temple region. In 1908, Chicago White Sox shortstop Freddy Parent wore a head protector of some sort and Chicago Cubs' first baseman-manager Frank Chance did the same thing in 1913, though Chance‚Äôs headgear was \\"little more than a sponge wrapped in a bandage.\\" In 1914, minor leaguer Joe Bosk, playing for the Utica Utes, wore a protector after being severely injured when he was struck in the head by a pitch in 1911. The first known case of a manager issuing head protectors to his players on a large scale was Philadelphia Phillies' manager Pat Moran who gave cork-cushioned hats to his players in 1921. ==Revived interest (1930s‚Äì1950s)== Despite the fatal beaning of Ray Chapman in 1920, protective headgear was still used only rarely in the major leagues. After Mickey Cochrane, a Hall of Fame catcher for the Detroit Tigers, suffered a career- ending and near-fatal skull fracture on May 25, 1937 on a pitch by New York Yankees' pitcher Bump Hadley, there was a strong call for batter helmets. Cochrane himself went on record saying that players should \\"absolutely\\" be required to wear protective helmets. In 1936, Willie Wells, a Negro League player, was knocked unconscious with a pitch to the temple. Disregarding the doctor's advice, Willie Wells wore a modified construction hard hat as protective gear in a game the next day. https://www.mlb.com/news/negro-league- innovations-adopted-by-mlb Only one week after Cochrane's injury, on June 1, 1937, the Cleveland Indians and Philadelphia Athletics became the first teams to test helmets, using leather and polo helmets respectively. Managers of both teams decided to use batting practice as a test run for helmet use on their players, before a game between the two teams. Though there is picture evidence of the polo helmets being worn in batting practice, there is no evidence of their being used or worn in a game. The first documented team to wear helmets in a game was the Des Moines Demons of the Western League. They also used polo helmets but the idea did not stick, as they only wore the helmets for one game. The first professional baseball league to fully adopt the baseball helmet was the International League, which did so in 1939 when the list of official equipment used began to include a \\"safety cap or helmet\\". Buster Mills was the first player in the league to use a helmet. Bob Hunter modeling a new baseball helmet in 1939. The helmet's design is similar to earmuffs and fits over the baseball cap. The idea of making helmets a required part of Major League Baseball was discussed by officials of the National League in a meeting at the 1940 MLB All-Star Game in Chicago. Ford Frick, president of the National League, showed the helmet he designed with the hopes that the league would adopt it. Though the National League at this meeting did not adopt it, Jackie Hayes became the first player to wear the helmet in a game on August 22, 1940. In 1941, the National League adopted the use of a helmet, designed by George Bennett, a Johns Hopkins University brain surgeon, for use by all teams in spring training. On March 8, 1941 the Brooklyn Dodgers announced that the team‚Äôs players would be wearing the helmets during regular season games. On April 26, 1941 the Washington Senators joined the Dodgers as the only two teams to fully adopt the batting helmet for regular season use. The New York Giants on June 6 and the Chicago Cubs on June 24 also joined the list of teams to fully adopt the use of protective helmets during games. Though many thought this would be the time when support would be strong enough to develop widespread usage, again tradition won out, and it was not until 1953 that the Pittsburgh Pirates mandated their players wear helmets. The helmet required by Pittsburgh General Manager Branch Rickey (formerly the Dodgers General Manager and President) was created by Charlie Muse and was based on the hard hats used by miners. Soon after, the Ottawa Citizen wrote that \\"Major League clubs are becoming quite interested in a new type of plastic protective cap which has been put on the market recently.\\" This became even more prevalent when on August 1, 1954, Joe Adcock, a first baseman for the Milwaukee Braves, was struck with a pitch on his head. He was wearing a helmet and, though he was taken off the field on a stretcher, he was uninjured as his helmet took the brunt of the impact and was visibly dented. In the early 1950s, the governing body of Little League Baseball mandated the use of protective headgear during games for all players. In 1956 the National League followed suit and required the use of batting helmets by all players on all teams. After Little League Baseball announced a better helmet for the use of all players, the American League passed the rule, on March 1, 1958 which required all players to wear helmets. However, though unlike in the NHL in the same era, helmets were widely accepted, it was not until December 1970\\"Baseball Committee Set Rules\\", Schenectady Gazette; December 2, 1970; p. 54 that Major League Baseball enforced strictly mandatory use of the batting helmet for all batters. Veteran players, however, were given the option of choosing to wear a helmet or not, as they were grandfathered into the rule. The last Major League player who did not wear a helmet while batting was Bob Montgomery, who last played for the Boston Red Sox in 1979 Incidentally, the same year the NHL finally made helmets compulsory with a similar grandfather clause for veteran players. ==Modifications (1960‚Äì2000)== Larry Bowa wears the flapless helmet formerly used by players (but still used by some catchers) and now used by coaches. In 1960, Jim Lemon became the first player to wear the new Little League helmet in a Major League game. These helmets were made with earflaps on both sides and were capable of withstanding a ball traveling at up to . One month later, Jimmy Piersall became the second player to wear the helmet in the Major Leagues. With the helmet being worn league wide in Major League Baseball, alterations began in 1961. On July 23, 1961, catcher Earl Battey was hit in the face with a pitch, fracturing a bone, and 10 days later returned to the field with a makeshift earflap to protect the injured area, though he only wore it for one game because he complained of difficulty seeing while wearing it. Tony Oliva also wore a makeshift face protector during batting practice, as did the Twins‚Äô Jimmie Hall in the 1965 World Series.\\"The Ear-flap Chronicles Continued\\" Uni-Watch Blog, August 2011 In 1964, the Phillies' Tony Gonz√°lez was the first to wear a batting helmet with a pre-molded earflap. Prior to this, earflaps had been improvised. Gonz√°lez was in the league top- ten in hit by pitches and the special helmet was constructed for his use. Shortly after this, Major League Baseball adopted the use of a helmet with a pre-molded earflap. Ron Santo was also an early pioneer of wearing earflap helmets at the major league level, upon returning to action after having his left cheekbone fractured by a pitch in 1966. Although helmets with earflaps were common at the amateur levels in baseball, they were slow to gain popularity at the professional level. Some batters felt that seeing the earflap out of the corner of an eye was distracting. Tony Conigliaro was wearing a helmet without an earflap when he was seriously injured by a pitch in August 1967. Robert Crow was a plastic and reconstructive surgeon working for the Atlanta Braves in the 1970s when he invented a device that could protect players who were coming back from facial injuries. He called it a \\"C-Flap\\" after his last name and what it protected ‚Äî the cheek. The device could be attached to the ear flap of the standard helmet to offer the added protection. The device did not become mainstream until decades later and in the meantime, players tried various things for the same purpose. For example, in 1978, the Pirates Dave Parker wore a hockey mask at the plate after he broke his cheek and jaw bones in a collision at home plate.\\"Aggh! It‚Äôs Dave Parker at the Plate\\" ESPN.com: Page 2, July 2008 This lasted only one game and Parker then tried to use a helmet with an attached two-bar football facemask. He also tried a helmet with another football facemask, the Dungard 210 facemask, screwed into his helmet. Other notable players to utilize non-C-flap modified batting helmet include Gary Roenicke (1979), Ellis Valentine (1980), Charlie Hayes (1994), and Otis Nixon (1998). The first known player to wear the C-flap was Oakland A‚Äôs catcher Terry Steinbach after breaking an orbital bone due to a freak pregame accident in May 1988. Steinbach had facial surgery and returned to action about a month later wearing a C-Flap. Other players would follow C-flap utilization, including [David Justice , Kevin Seitzer, Mike Devereaux, Marlon Byrd, Chase Headley, and Jason Heyward. Heyward was the first player to begin wearing the C-flap permanently (2013) after enduring a facial injury, and Yadier Molina (2016) was the first player to begin permanently wearing the C-flap to prevent a facial injury where he had not previously had one. In 1983, it was made mandatory for new players to use a helmet with at least one earflap. Players who were grandfathered in could choose to wear a helmet without ear flaps, if they so desired. Players can choose to wear double earflap helmets in the major leagues; however, this is not mandatory. Tim Raines was the last player to wear a helmet without earflaps, during the 2002 season. His flap-less Florida Marlins helmet is currently at the Baseball Hall of Fame. Gary Gaetti, who retired in the year 2000, plus Ozzie Smith and Tim Wallach, who both retired in 1996, also wore flapless helmets until they retired.\\"La Point of It All\\"; in Newsday; April 11, 1993; p. 07 Julio Franco, who retired from baseball in May 2008, was the last active player eligible to wear a helmet without flaps, but he chose to wear a helmet with an earflap throughout his career. Some players, mostly switch hitters, also decide to wear double earflap helmets while batting. Players to do this include Willie McGee, Terry Pendleton, Chuck Knoblauch, Shane Victorino, Orlando Hudson, Chin Soo Choo, Trot Nixon, and Jed Lowrie (all of which are switch hitters).\\"Orlando Hudson Batting Helmet\\" in Alright Hamilton!, February 2010 On April 8, 2004, celebrated as \\"Hank Aaron Day\\" in Atlanta because it is the 30th anniversary of Hank Aaron‚Äôs record-breaking 715th home run, Braves shortstop Rafael Furcal came to the plate in the sixth inning with a helmet without an earflap, as a tribute to Hank Aaron, who played his entire career in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, and therefore did not wear a helmet with an earflap during his playing career. Umpire Bill Welke made him get one with a flap. On May 28, 2018 Philadelphia Phillies slugger Rhys Hoskins fractured his jaw when he fouled a ball off his own face against the Los Angeles Dodgers. Hoskins, 25, was given a choice: miss four to six weeks or return after 10 days on the disabled list with a C-Flap on both sides for complete armament. Hoskins opted to return early with the double-C-Flap look, and just 12 days later, Hoskins made his return from the disabled list. Currently, all leagues up to and including Minor League Baseball require the use of a double earflap batting helmet, with certain state amateur leagues being one exception (e.g., South Dakota Amateur Baseball Association). In Major League Baseball, however, only one earflap is required (for the ear closest to the pitcher). ==Recent developments (Since 2000)== Jason Heyward wears a helmet with a protective guard during a 2014 game. Heyward started wearing the guard after being hit by a pitch in his face, which caused him to suffer a broken jaw. In 2005, Major League Baseball tested a new batting helmet for the first time in nearly three decades. At the All-Star Game in Detroit, players were seen wearing a new \\"molded crown\\" helmet that featured side vents, back vents and larger ear holes.\\"\\"MLB midseason fashion report\\" ESPN.com: p. 2, July 2005 The majority of players now wear these new helmets but some including Ryan Howard stayed with the older style. The no-flap helmet is still utilized in baseball. Catchers often wear a flapless helmet along with a facemask to protect the head when receiving pitches. Occasionally, players other than catchers will wear a batting helmet without earflaps while playing a defensive position in the field. This is usually done by a player who has a higher-than-normal risk of head injury. One example is former major- league player John Olerud, who started doing so after undergoing emergency surgery for a cerebral aneurysm while attending Washington State University. An earlier example was Richie Allen, who decided to wear a helmet in the field after at least one incident of being hit by objects thrown by fans. Major League bat-boys/bat-girls and ball boys/ball girls are required to wear a helmet rather than a cap while performing their duties while on the field of play. They are allowed to use the no-flap helmet for this purpose, and many do. Following the 2007 death of Tulsa Drillers first base coach Mike Coolbaugh after being hit by a batted ball, there has been debate as to whether base coaches should wear helmets. Following the incident, the Oakland Athletics' Rene Lachemann decided to wear a helmet out to his third base coaching position. After the 2007 season, Major League Baseball made it mandatory for coaches to wear helmets beginning with the 2008 season,\\"MLB GMs: Base coaches must wear helmets in 2008\\" in USA Today, November 11, 2007 although some coaches, such as the Los Angeles Dodgers‚Äô Larry Bowa, have disagreed with the decision.\\"Larry Bowa will not wear your stupid helmet\\" in USA Today, February 29, 2008 In 2009, Major League Baseball decided to take action and protect players from the increasing number of concussions and head injuries.\\"Better to look good than feel good?\\" ESPN.com: Page 2 , August 2009 Rawlings came out with the S100 baseball helmet, named for its impact capabilities.

In 2013, per the new MLB-MLBPA Collective Bargaining Agreement, MLB players were required to wear the new Rawlings S100 Pro Comp.\\"MLB Players to Debut New Rawlings S100 Pro Comp‚Ñ¢ Batting Helmet This Season\\" PRNewswire, April 2012 In 2018, several Major League Baseball players including Mike Trout and Bryce Harper began wearing the C-flap, an attachment to the earflap covering the jaw, invented by Markwort.

It is named for its large horns. A pair of horns might weigh up to ; the sheep typically weigh up to . Recent genetic testing indicates three distinct subspecies of Ovis canadensis, one of which is endangered: O. c. sierrae. Sheep originally crossed to North America over the Bering Land Bridge from Siberia; the population in North America peaked in the millions, and the bighorn sheep entered into the mythology of Native Americans. By 1900, the population had crashed to several thousand, due to diseases introduced through European livestock and overhunting. ==Taxonomy and genetics== Ovis canadensis is one of three species of mountain sheep in North America and Siberia; the other two species being O. dalli, which includes Dall sheep and Stone's sheep, and the Siberian snow sheep, O. nivicola. Wild sheep crossed the Bering land bridge from Siberia into Alaska during the Pleistocene (about 750,000 years ago) and subsequently spread through western North America as far south as Baja California and northwestern mainland Mexico. Divergence from their closest Asian ancestor (snow sheep) occurred about 600,000 years ago. In North America, wild sheep diverged into two extant species‚ÄîDall sheep, which occupy Alaska and northwestern Canada, and bighorn sheep, which range from southwestern Canada to Mexico. However, the status of these species is questionable given that hybridization has occurred between them in their recent evolutionary history. ===Subspecies=Former=== In 1940, Ian McTaggart-Cowan split the species into seven subspecies, with the first three being mountain bighorns and the last four being desert bighorns: * Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep, O. c. canadensis, found from British Columbia to Arizona. * Badlands bighorn sheep or Audubon's bighorn sheep, O. c. auduboni, occurred in North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, and Nebraska. This subspecies has been extinct since 1925. * California bighorn sheep, O. c. californiana, found from British Columbia south to California and east to North Dakota. The definition of this subspecies has been updated (see below). * Nelson's bighorn sheep, O. c. nelsoni, the most common desert bighorn sheep, ranges from California through Arizona. * Mexican bighorn sheep, O. c. mexicana, ranges from Arizona and New Mexico south to Sonora and Chihuahua. * Peninsular bighorn sheep O. c. cremnobates, occur in the Peninsular Ranges of California and Baja California * Weems' bighorn sheep, O. c. weemsi, found in southern Baja California. ===Current=== Female Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep (O. c. canadensis) in Yellowstone National Park Starting in 1993, Ramey and colleagues, using DNA testing, have shown this division into seven subspecies is largely illusory. Most scientists currently recognize three subspecies of bighorn. This taxonomy is supported by the most extensive genetics (microsatellite and mitochondrial DNA) study to date (2016) which found high divergence between Rocky Mountain and Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep, and that these two subspecies both diverged from desert bighorn prior to or during the Illinoian glaciation (about 315‚Äì94 thousand years ago). Thus, the three subspecies of O. canadensis are: * Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep (O. c. canadensis) ‚Äì occupying the U.S. and Canadian Rocky Mountains, and the Northwestern United States. * Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep (O. c. sierrae) ‚Äì formerly California bighorn sheep, a genetically distinct subspecies that only occurs in the Sierra Nevada in California. However, historic observer records suggest that bighorn sheep may have ranged as far west as the California Coastal Ranges which are contiguous to the Sierra Nevada via the Transverse Ranges. An account of \\"wild sheep\\" in the vicinity of the Mission San Antonio near Jolon, California and the mountains around San Francisco Bay dates to circa 1769. * Desert bighorn sheep (O. c. nelsoni) ‚Äì occurring throughout the desert regions of the Southwestern United States and Northwestern Mexico. The 2016 genetics study suggested more modest divergence of this desert bighorn sheep into three lineages consistent with the earlier work of Cowan: Nelson's (O. c. nelsoni), Mexican (O. c. mexicana), and Peninsular (O. c. cremnobates). These three lineages occupy desert biomes that vary significantly in climate, suggesting exposure to different selection regimens. In addition, two populations are currently considered endangered by the United States government: * Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep (O. c. sierrae), * Peninsular bighorn sheep, a distinct population segment of desert bighorn sheep (O. c. nelsoni) ==Description== A juvenile (lamb) Bighorn sheep are named for the large, curved horns borne by the rams (males). Ewes (females) also have horns, but they are shorter with less curvature. They range in color from light brown to grayish or dark, chocolate brown, with a white rump and lining on the backs of all four legs. Males typically weigh , are tall at the shoulder, and long from the nose to the tail. Females are typically , tall, and long. Male bighorn sheep have large horn cores, enlarged cornual and frontal sinuses, and internal bony septa. These adaptations serve to protect the brain by absorbing the impact of clashes. Bighorn sheep have preorbital glands on the anterior corner of each eye, inguinal glands in the groin, and pedal glands on each foot. Secretions from these glands may support dominance behaviors. Bighorns from the Rocky Mountains are relatively large, with males that occasionally exceed and females that exceed . In contrast, Sierra Nevada bighorn males weigh up to only and females to . Males' horns can weigh up to , as much as the rest of the bones in the male's body. ==Natural historyEcology=== Bighorn rams The Rocky Mountains and Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep occupy the cooler mountainous regions of Canada and the United States. In contrast, the desert bighorn sheep subspecies are indigenous to the hot desert ecosystems of the Southwestern United States and Mexico. Bighorn sheep generally inhabit alpine meadows, grassy mountain slopes, and foothill country near rugged, rocky cliffs and bluffs. Since bighorn sheep cannot move through deep snow, they prefer drier slopes, where the annual snowfall is less than about per year. A bighorn's winter range usually lies at lower elevations than its summer range. Bighorn sheep are highly susceptible to certain diseases carried by domestic sheep, such as psoroptic scabies and pneumonia; additional mortality occurs as a result of accidents involving rock falls or falling off cliffs (a hazard of living in steep, rugged terrain). Bighorns are well adapted to climbing steep terrain, where they seek cover from predators. Predation primarily occurs with lambs, which are hunted by coyotes, bobcats, lynxes, and golden eagles. Bighorn sheep of all ages are threatened by bears, wolves, and especially mountain lions, which are perhaps best equipped with the agility to prey on them in uneven, rocky habitats. They are considered good indicators of land health because the species is sensitive to many human- induced environmental problems. In addition to their aesthetic value, bighorn sheep are considered desirable game animals by hunters. Bighorn sheep graze on grasses and browse shrubs, particularly in fall and winter, and seek minerals at natural salt licks. Females tend to forage and walk, possibly to avoid predators and protect lambs, while males tend to eat and then rest and ruminate, which lends to more effective digestion and greater increase in body size. ===Social structure and reproduction=== A bighorn ram following a juvenile ewe Bighorn sheep live in large herds, and do not typically follow a single leader ram, unlike the mouflon, the ancestor of the domestic sheep, which has a strict dominance hierarchy. Prior to the mating season or \\"rut\\", the rams attempt to establish a dominance hierarchy to determine access to ewes for mating. During the prerut period, most of the characteristic horn clashing occurs between rams, although this behavior may occur to a limited extent throughout the year. Bighorn sheep exhibit agonistic behavior: two competitors walk away from each other and then turn to face each other before jumping and lunging into headbutts. Rams' horns can frequently exhibit damage from repeated clashes. Females exhibit a stable, nonlinear hierarchy that correlates with age. Females may fight for high social status when they are integrated into the hierarchy at one to two years of age. Rocky Mountain bighorn rams employ at least three different courting strategies. The most common and successful is the tending strategy, in which a ram follows and defends an estrous ewe. Tending takes considerable strength and vigilance, and ewes are most receptive to tending males, presumably feeling they are the most fit. Another tactic is coursing, which is when rams fight for an already tended ewe. Ewes typically avoid coursing males, so the strategy is not effective. Rams also employ a blocking strategy. They prevent a ewe from accessing tending areas before she even goes into estrus. Bighorn ewes have a six-month gestation. In temperate climates, the peak of the rut occurs in November with one, or rarely two, lambs being born in May. Most births occur in the first two weeks of the lambing period. Pregnant ewes of the Rocky Mountains migrate to alpine areas in spring, presumably to give birth in areas safer from predation, but are away from areas with good quality forage. Lambs born earlier in the season are more likely to survive than lambs born later. Lambs born late may not have access to sufficient milk, as their mothers are lactating at a time when food quality is lower. Newborn lambs weigh from and can walk within hours. The lambs are then weaned when they reach four to six months old. The lifespan of ewes is typically 10‚Äì14 years, and 9‚Äì12 years for rams. ===Infectious disease=== Skull Many bighorn sheep populations in the United States experience regular outbreaks of infectious pneumonia, which likely result from the introduction of bacterial pathogens (in particular, Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae, and some strains of Mannheimia haemolytica) carried asymptomatically in domestic sheep. Once introduced, pathogens can transmit rapidly through a bighorn population, resulting in all-age die-offs that sometimes kill up to 90% of the population. In the years following pathogen introduction, bighorn populations frequently experience multiple years of lamb pneumonia outbreaks. These outbreaks can severely limit recruitment and likely play a powerful role in slowing population growth. ==Relationship with humans== Bighorn sheep ===Conservation=== Two hundred years ago, bighorn sheep were widespread throughout the western United States, Canada, and northern Mexico. The population was estimated to be 150,000 to 200,000. Unregulated hunting, habitat destruction, overgrazing of rangelands, and diseases contracted from domestic livestock all contributed to the decline, the most drastic occurring from about 1870 through 1950. In 1936, the Arizona Boy Scouts mounted a statewide campaign to save the bighorn sheep. The scouts first became interested in the sheep through the efforts of Major Frederick Russell Burnham. Burnham observed that fewer than 150 of these sheep still lived in the Arizona mountains. The National Wildlife Federation, the Izaak Walton League, and the National Audubon Society also joined the effort. On January 18, 1939, over of land were set aside to create the Kofa National Wildlife Refuge and the Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge. Restoration of bighorn sheep has been pursued actively by many state and federal agencies since the 1940s, although these efforts have met with only limited success, and most of the historical range of bighorns remains unoccupied. Hunting for male bighorn sheep is allowed, but heavily regulated, in Canada and the United States. === In culture === A petroglyph of a caravan of bighorn sheep near Moab, Utah, United States, a common theme in glyphs from the desert southwest Bighorn sheep were among the most admired animals of the Apsaalooka (Crow) people, and what is today called the Bighorn Mountain Range was central to the Apsaalooka tribal lands. In the Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area book, storyteller Old Coyote describes a legend related to the bighorn sheep. A man possessed by evil spirits attempts to kill his heir by pushing the young man over a cliff, but the victim is saved by getting caught in trees. Rescued by bighorn sheep, the man takes the name of their leader, Big Metal. The other sheep grant him power, wisdom, sharp eyes, sure-footedness, keen ears, great strength, and a strong heart. Big Metal returns to his people with the message that the Apsaalooka people will survive only so long as the river winding out of the mountains is known as the Bighorn River. Bighorn sheep are hunted for their meat and horns, which are used in ceremonies, as food, and as hunting trophies. They also serve as a source of ecotourism, as tourists come to see the bighorn sheep in their native habitat. The Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep is the provincial mammal of Alberta and the state animal of Colorado and as such is incorporated into the symbol for the Colorado Division of Parks and Wildlife. Bighorn sheep were once known by the scientific identification \\"argali\\" or \\"argalia\\" due to assumption that they were the same animal as the Asiatic argali (Ovis ammon). Lewis and Clark recorded numerous sightings of O. canadensis in the journals of their exploration‚Äîsometimes using the name argalia. In addition, they recorded the use of bighorn sheep horns by the Shoshone in making composite bows. William Clark's Track Map produced after the expedition in 1814 indicated a tributary of the Yellowstone River named Argalia Creek and a tributary of the Missouri River named Argalia River, both in what is today Montana. Neither of these tributaries retained these names, however. The Bighorn River, another tributary of the Yellowstone, and its tributary stream, the Little Bighorn River were both indicated on Clark's map and did retain their names, the latter being the namesake of the Battle of the Little Bighorn. ==References== ==External links== *U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service Species Profile *Photos & Information on Wild Rocky Mountain Bighorn Sheep in Nevada. *Animal Diversity site *BIGHORN-SHEEP.com *Texas Bighorn WebCam *BIGHORN.org *Rocky Mountain bighorn research *Greater Yellowstone Resource Guide ‚Äì Bighorn Sheep *Desert Bighorn Sheep Facts California Department of Fish and Game * Smithsonian Institution ‚Äì North American Mammals: Ovis canadensis Category:Ovis Category:Mammals of Canada Category:Mammals of Mexico Category:Mammals of the United States Category:Fauna of the Western United States Category:Fauna of the California chaparral and woodlands Category:Native American cuisine Category:Provincial symbols of Alberta Category:Symbols of Colorado Category:Mammals described in 1804 Category:Extant Middle Pleistocene first appearances Category:Taxa named by George Shaw sah:–ß—É–±—É–∫—É ","title":"Bighorn sheep"},{"id":"525075","text":"Conor Mullen Oberst (born February 15, 1980) is an American singer-songwriter best known for his work in Bright Eyes. He has also played in several other bands, including Desaparecidos, The Faint (previously named Norman Bailer), Commander Venus, Park Ave., Conor Oberst and the Mystic Valley Band, Monsters of Folk, and Better Oblivion Community Center. Oberst was named the Best Songwriter of 2008 by Rolling Stone magazine. ==Early life and education== Conor Mullen Oberst was born on February 15, 1980, as the youngest boy in a family of three boys, and raised in Omaha, Nebraska, to Matthew Ryan Oberst, Sr., an information manager for Mutual of Omaha, and Nancy Oberst, an elementary education director for Omaha Public Schools. Oberst had two older brothers, Matthew Ryan Oberst, Jr. and Justin H. Oberst. Matthew was a teacher and part-time musician until his death in 2016, and helped finance one of Oberst's self-released independent albums. Matt was also in the indie band Sorry About Dresden, which Conor played in from time to time. Justin Oberst is a graduate of the University of Nebraska College of Law and managing partner of a law firm. Conor has been writing and releasing music from a very young age, releasing his first solo album when he was 13. Oberst was educated at St. Pius X/St. Leo School in Omaha, Nebraska, where he was in the school choir and other musical groups, and Creighton Preparatory School, also in Omaha, Nebraska. He briefly was enrolled at the University of Nebraska and dropped out after three semesters to tour. ==CareerEarly career=== One night in 1992, Ted Stevens (of Mayday and Cursive) invited Oberst onstage to play. Bill Hoover, who was in attendance, invited Oberst to come back to play with him a couple of weeks later. In that short amount of time, Oberst wrote enough songs to fill out the set, establishing himself as an artist.Lazy-I Interview: Bright Eyes (December 1998) Retrieved on January 4, 2008. Shortly thereafter, Oberst began committing his new repertoire to tape in his parents' basement with his father's four track cassette recorder and an acoustic guitar. In mid-1993, Oberst self-released his debut album Water on cassette tape.Norris, Chris\\" (June 25, 2009), \\"CONOR OBERST'S MYSTICAL AWAKENING\\". Rolling Stone (1081): The release of the album was financed by his brother Justin on what they called Lumberjack Records, the indie label that would become Saddle Creek Records, making them founders and present day executives of the label. Shortly after his two solo recordings, Oberst began playing with four friends; they formed Commander Venus in mid-1995. Here's to Special Treatment was followed by 1996's The Soundtrack to My Movie, a cassette only released on Sing Eunuchs!. Kill the Monster Before It Eats Baby, a split 7\\" vinyl with Bill Hoover, was also released around this time. ===The Faint (1994‚Äì1995)=== In 1994, following a Slowdown Virginia show, Oberst, along with Joel Petersen and brothers Todd Fink and Clark Baechle, formed a band called Norman Bailer, later known as The Faint. A few days later, Oberst told the other members of the band that they had a show in two weeks at Kilgore's. Despite having never performed together, they produced nine songs to perform. An album, Sine Sierra, was released (on cassette only) in 1995. ===Commander Venus (1994‚Äì1998)=== Oberst formed the rock band Commander Venus in 1994 with Tim Kasher, Ben Armstrong, and Robb Nansel. They recorded two albums: Do You Feel at Home? (1995) and The Uneventful Vacation (1997). Kasher later went on to form Cursive and Nansel was the co-founder of Saddle Creek Records. Kasher left the group to focus on Cursive as they were about to go into the studio to record their second album, and was replaced by Todd Baechle. Commander Venus disbanded in 1998. ===The Magnetas (1996)=== The Magnetas were only active for a very brief period of time in 1996 in Omaha. Along with Oberst, band members included Todd Fink (The Faint) and Chris Hughes (Beep Beep). They recorded three songs, only one of which (\\"Anex Anex\\") was released on Ghostmeat Records Parts compilation album. Two other confirmed recordings exist: \\"Clatter\\" and \\"Science Fiction in Schools.\\" ===Park Ave. (1996)=== In January 1996, Oberst began playing drums in a group named Park Ave., alongside Clark Baechle, Jenn Bernard, Neely Jenkins (now in the band Tilly and the Wall), and Jamie Williams (also in Tilly and the Wall). The group only played between 10 and 15 shows and made a handful of recordings (several of them with Mike Mogis as producer). The group disbanded in 1998 when Williams, the singer and primary songwriter, moved to London, England. In 1999, Urinine Records released their only album, When Jamie Went to London ... We Broke Up, which has also now been re-released under Team Love. ===Bright Eyes (1995‚Äì2011, 2020‚Äìpresent)=== Conor Oberst performing in 2005 with Bright Eyes at Schlachthof, in Wiesbaden, GermanyOberst in 2010 performing at the Hardly Strictly Bluegrass music festival in San Francisco Oberst founded Bright Eyes as a solo project in 1995, and after the disbanding of Commander Venus, released A Collection of Songs Written and Recorded 1995‚Äì1997 in January 1998. This was followed quickly by Letting Off the Happiness, released in November of the same year. It featured members of numerous bands and was recorded in the Oberst family basement. One year later, Bright Eyes released its first EP, Every Day and Every Night. Bright Eyes' third album, Fevers and Mirrors was released in May 2000; it was ranked 170 on Pitchfork's list of the top 200 albums of the 2000s. With the release of 2002's Lifted or The Story Is in the Soil, Keep Your Ear to the Ground, Bright Eyes received national attention and Oberst was proclaimed a breakthrough artist by several notable magazines. On January 25, 2005 Bright Eyes simultaneously released two new albums: the folk I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning and more electronic-pop Digital Ash in a Digital Urn. Time listed I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning as one of the top ten albums of 2005. The Four Winds EP was released in March 2007, followed by their seventh album, Cassadaga in April. The song \\"Four Winds\\" was named a top 100 song of 2007 by Rolling Stone and was performed by Oberst with Gillian Welch and Dave Rawlings, along with \\"Man Named Truth\\" on the Another Day, Another Time concert album commemorating the music of the film Inside Llewyn Davis. Oberst spent the next two years focusing on other music projects, and in June 2009 told Rolling Stone he wanted to make one final album with Bright Eyes before retiring the group. The band subsequently released The People's Key on Conor's 31st birthday, February 15, 2011. In January 2020 the band announced their return to both touring and recording after a nine-year hiatus, and released their tenth album Down in the Weeds, Where the World Once Was on August 21, 2020. ===Desaparecidos (2001‚Äì2002, 2012‚Äìpresent)=== Oberst is a guitarist and singer for Desaparecidos. The music and lyrics of Desaparecidos differ greatly from Bright Eyes, having more in common with punk rock than Oberst's usual folk rock. The lyrics are generally social commentary on the state of affairs in America and the pitfalls of the suburban lifestyle, as opposed to the more introspective lyrics of Bright Eyes. Desaparecidos was active as a band between 2001‚Äì2002 but have regrouped to play shows in the Omaha area. They had two releases in 2002: a single for \\"The Happiest Place on Earth\\" and the full- length Read Music / Speak Spanish, on Saddle Creek Records. In 2012, the band regrouped and self-released the 7\\" single \\"MariKKKopa/Backsell\\", as well as continuing to tour. In 2013, they released two more 7\\"s independently, \\"Anonymous / The Left is Right\\" and \\"Te Amo Camila Vallejo / The Underground Man\\" (dedicated to the Chilean student activist Camila Vallejo), and complimented these releases with yet another tour. In 2015, the band announced the release of a new studio album, Payola, on June 23 on Epitaph Records. On October 28, 2015, it was announced that Conor Oberst had been hospitalized due to \\"laryngitis, anxiety, and exhaustion,\\" according to a press release. The entirety of Desaparecidos' remaining tour dates were cancelled and Oberst returned to his hometown of Omaha to recuperate. ===Conor Oberst and the Mystic Valley Band (2007‚Äì2012)=== In November 2007, it was reported that Oberst would work on a solo record with Jake Bellows, and that he and M. Ward would start a band and perform two late December shows in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Contrary to what was believed, the shows were not played with M. Ward, but rather with Nik Freitas and Jason Boesel. They also played a show in February in Mexico City, Mexico. On March 31, 2008, it was announced that Conor Oberst would play at the 2008 Reading and Leeds Festivals. He also performed at the Electric Picnic, in County Laois, Ireland, on August 31, 2008, the Cains Ballroom in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and Austin City Limits in late September 2008, shows across Australia in early October 2008, and the Warfield Theater in San Francisco October 24. Oberst also headlined the Friday night slot of the End of the Road Festival at the Larmer Tree Gardens in Wiltshire, held over the weekend of September 12‚Äì14, 2008. Conor Oberst released the self-titled album Conor Oberst, which was recorded in Tepoztl√°n, Morelos, Mexico, with Taylor Hollingsworth on guitar and Macey Taylor on bass, on August 5, 2008, on Merge Records. In about mid-October, the band sold a new EP, Gentleman's Pact. It was limited to 1000 copies and was only available on tour. The band placed limitations on how many were sold at shows. It has four unreleased tracks. Three of them are pre-album songs while \\"Corina, Corina\\" is a cover of a traditional folk song. Oberst and the band released their second album, Outer South, on May 5, 2009, on Merge Records. They have also released a documentary, One of My Kind, following the band from Conor's solo album to their most recent album One of My Kind. ===Monsters of Folk (2009)=== Conor Oberst is one of the four members of the band Monsters of Folk. Other band members include Jim James of My Morning Jacket, M. Ward and fellow Bright Eyes member Mike Mogis. The band members swap instruments and share vocal duties. The quartet released their self-titled debut album on September 22, 2009. ===Solo work (2012‚Äìpresent)=== Oberst released his first solo album, Water, in the form of a cassette tape when he was just 13. However, this album is difficult to find and is no longer sold. Throughout the end of 2012 and the beginning of 2013, Oberst embarked on a solo tour of North America and Europe performing with Ben Brodin on guitar and vibraphone. On the tour, he played songs from Bright Eyes, Mystic Valley Band, and Monsters of Folk as well as playing new songs. Oberst released a new solo record, titled Upside Down Mountain, on May 19, 2014. He has been working with producer Jonathan Wilson (Dawes, Father John Misty) and Swedish duo First Aid Kit. On October 14, 2016, Oberst released his seventh studio solo record, titled Ruminations, on Nonesuch Records. On January 18, 2017, Oberst announced a companion album to Ruminations, called Salutations. ===Better Oblivion Community Center (2019)=== Oberst and Phoebe Bridgers revealed their oft rumored new band, Better Oblivion Community Center, on the Late Show with Stephen Colbert on January 23, 2019 and released their eponymous debut album at midnight on January 24, 2019 (out via Dead Oceans). Band members include guitarist Nick Zinner from Yeah Yeah Yeahs and drummer Carla Azar from Autolux. ==Personal life== In 2010, Oberst married Corina Figueroa Escamilla, whom he met in 2008 while recording music in Mexico. Oberst and Figueroa Escamilla separated amicably in 2017. In December 2013, Oberst was accused of sexual assault by a fan, leading to widespread media coverage. However, by July 2014, the fan had retracted the accusation, stating that the accusations were \\"100% false\\" and that \\"my actions were wrong and could undermine the claims of actual sexual assault victims, and for that I also apologize\\". Of the period in his life, Oberst said \\"I'm not violent towards anyone ... And for a second, to have the whole world think that [the allegations were] true about me just did a number on my psyche.\\" He also went on to emphasize that he didn't want to minimize how frequently women are sexually assaulted, citing the statistic that one in four women will experience sexual assault at some point and saying that \\"as painful and surreal and fucked up as my situation was, I don't ever want to use this as an example to justify anything.\\" Oberst's brother Matthew died suddenly on November 27, 2016, in Cary, North Carolina, where he was a schoolteacher. He was 42. Oberst didn't elaborate on his brother's death, except to say, \\"[he] basically fucking drank himself to death,\\" a comment for which he has since expressed regret: \\"I guess [Vice] caught me on a day where I just didn't really give a fuck. I remember feeling bad afterwards when I had described the way my brother passed away, not thinking about [...] my niece and nephew. They're definitely old enough to read an article.\\" In the same 2020 interview, Oberst clarified the circumstances of Matthew's death: \\"It was kind of inconclusive. He had sleep apnea and he obviously struggled with addiction, but I came to find out it wasn't quite as clear cut as I made it seem.\\" ==Other projectsSaddle Creek records=== Oberst is one of the founding members of the independent record label Saddle Creek Records, an integral part of Omaha's indie rock scene, which hosts bands such as Cursive, Desaparecidos, The Faint (who left to start their own label Blank.wav), Rilo Kiley (who left to start their own label Brute/Beaute Records), Bright Eyes, Two Gallants, Son, Ambulance, Azure Ray, The Good Life, and Sorry About Dresden, among others. ===Team Love records=== Oberst co-founded the Team Love record label (along with Nate Krenkel, longtime manager of Bright Eyes) to \\"do different things, or smaller things, that we couldn't get everyone to be into at the same time\\" at Saddle Creek. such as Tilly and the Wall, Willy Mason, The Felice Brothers, David Dondero, Taylor Hollingsworth and Jenny Lewis' solo album with The Watson Twins. ===Pageturners Lounge=== Oberst opened Pageturners Lounge, a bar, with Philip Schaffart in 2012. Pageturners Lounge is located in the Dundee neighborhood in Omaha. The business name is a holdover from the bookstore that formerly occupied the space. ==ArtistryMusic style and influences=== Oberst was drawn to music at a very early age, due in part to his brother Matt's penchant for bands like The Smiths, R.E.M., Fugazi, and The Cure. He has cited The Cure's first singles collection, Staring at the Sea, as the first record he ever bought, as well as being one of his favorites. \\"It must have been third grade...I bought the cassette at a local record store chain called Homer's in Omaha. I just loved the sound of Robert Smith's voice. It just sounded good.\\"RollingStone.com ‚Äì Conor Oberst of Bright Eyes on the Cure's Standing on a Beach. Retrieved on January 4, 2008. Some of his biggest influences and favorite songwriters are local musicians David Dondero and Simon Joyner.Comes With A Smile ‚Äì Interview: Bright Eyes (Conor Oberst) by Mariko Sakamoto Retrieved on January 4, 2008. Joyner wrote the song \\"Burn Rubber\\", which Bright Eyes covered on the \\"Take It Easy (Love Nothing)\\" single. The two used to do mini-tours together, usually on weekends due to Joyner having a family. Oberst has also been heavily influenced by the 1960s folk revival, mentioning Neil Young, Leonard Cohen, and country singers Emmylou Harris, John Prine and Townes Van Zandt. Harris sang on a few tracks on Bright Eyes' I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning. As a prolific and well-known musician in the folk genre, he has sometimes been defined as \\"a new Bob Dylan.\\" He covered Neil Young's \\"Out on the Weekend\\", collaborating with Mike Mogis, Jim James and M. Ward in concert. He performed the Townes Van Zandt song \\"Rex's Blues\\" live with fellow musician Steve Earle. He has also performed two of John Prine's songs live, \\"Crazy as a Loon\\" and \\"Wedding Day in Funerville\\". Oberst was greatly influenced by Daniel Johnston, whose \\"Devil Town\\" was covered and featured on Noise Floor, and profoundly influenced by Elliott Smith, stating in an October 22, 2003 All Things Considered interview that, \\"sometimes when you're not feeling good, you have to listen to really sad music like Elliott Smith's\\" and that [Smith] \\"wrote the sweetest, saddest, most gentle songs\\". Oberst also said he liked to \\"listen to Elliott Smith's songs when he [couldn't] find anyone to talk to on the phone\\" and thought that it was sad that \\"through his music, [Smith] had the ability to answer feelings in others that he was unable to answer in himself\\".Singer Elliott Smith Dead in Apparent Suicide Retrieved on May 30, 2009.

This represented the largest single donation to USC and the largest to any film school in the world.John Zollinger, George Lucas Donates $175 Million to USC , USC Public Relations, September 20, 2006 His previous donations resulted in the naming of two buildings in the school's previous complex, opened in 1984, after him and his then-wife Marcia, though Lucas was not fond of the Spanish Colonial Revival architecture used in those buildings. An architectural hobbyist, Lucas laid out the original designs for the project, inspired by the Mediterranean Revival Style that was used in older campus buildings as well as the Los Angeles area. The project also received another $50 million in contributions from Warner Bros., 20th Century Fox and The Walt Disney Company. In fall 2006, the school, together with the Royal Film Commission of Jordan, created the Red Sea Institute of Cinematic Arts (RSICA) in Aqaba, Jordan.Jordan Signs Cinema Pact With USC, USC Public Relations, September 20, 2006 The first classes were held in 2008, and the first graduating class for the university was in 2010. ==Facilities== Donations from film and game industry companies, friends, and alumni have enabled the school to build the following facilities:Facilities * School of Cinematic Arts Complex, completed in 2010, which includes: ** 20th Century Fox soundstage ** George Lucas and Steven Spielberg Buildings, featuring the Ray Stark Family Theatre, which is equipped for 3D presentation, as well as two digital theatres, the Albert and Dana Broccoli Theatre and Fanny Brice Theatre ** Marcia Lucas Post-Production Center ** Marilyn & Jeffrey Katzenberg Center for Animation ** Sumner Redstone Production Building ** Interactive building (SCI), home the USC Interactive Media & Games Division, the USC Division of Media Arts and Practice, and several research labs (the Game Innovation Lab, the Mobile and Environmental Media Lab, the Mixed Reality Lab and the Creative Media & Behavioral Health Center, among others) * Robert Zemeckis Center for Digital Arts, home of Trojan Vision, USC's student television station * Eileen Norris Cinema Theatre Complex, featuring a 365-seat theatre that also serves as a classroom with USC faculty member and Academy Award winner Tomlinson Holman's THX audiovisual reproduction standard used in film venues worldwide.

He was at once a merchant, architect and builder. His firm, Morgan and Company, was one of the largest wholesale importers of dry goods and a manufacturer of clothing; the business was sufficiently sound and respected to be permitted to issue script money during the Panic of January 30, 1844. He was appointed to the new commission charged with planning a new State Capitol for Tennessee, becoming its president in 1854, Morgan was instrumental in choosing William Strickland of Philadelphia as the architect of this monumental structure. In 1856 his firm built the Italianate style Morgan-Reeves Building at 208-210 Public Square; the building survived until 1975. (Building photos and details‚Äîexternal link) During the American Civil War, Morgan engaged in manufacturing munitions for the Confederates until Nashville's occupation by Union forces. He was also a Confederate official, serving as chairman of the Central Bureau of Military Supplies in Nashville during the War. Morgan had two sons killed during the war serving in the Confederate States Army. His nephew, Brig. Gen. John Hunt Morgan of Alabama, served with the Confederate cavalry and gained fame as the leader of Morgan's Raiders. He was killed in 1864. ==Personal life== Morgan was married on November 2, 1819, to Matilda Grant Rose Mackintosh of Staunton. They had 12 children.Genealogy webpage ==Death and legacy== Morgan died in Nashville and his remains were interred in the southeast corner of the State Capitol. Morgan Park in the historic Germantown section of Nashville was named in honor of Morgan. On June 10, 1980, the hundredth anniversary of Samuel Morgan's death, a ceremony was held at the Tennessee Capitol Building in his honor. The State Legislature declared that day to be \\"Samuel Dold Morgan Day\\" (Senate Joint Resolution 351). ==References== ==External links== * UNC Library Category:1798 births Category:1880 deaths Category:American Civil War industrialists Category:People from Nashville, Tennessee Category:People from Staunton, Virginia Category:People of Tennessee in the American Civil War Category:Businesspeople from Tennessee ","title":"Samuel Morgan"},{"id":"525086","text":"The Fijian coups of 1987 resulted in the overthrow of the elected government of Fijian Prime Minister Timoci Bavadra, the deposition of Elizabeth II as Queen of Fiji, and in the declaration of a republic. The first coup, in which Bavadra was deposed, took place on 14 May 1987; a second coup on 28 September ended the monarchy, and was shortly followed by the proclamation of a republic on 7 October. Both military actions were led by Lieutenant Colonel Sitiveni Rabuka, then third in command of the Royal Fiji Military Forces. Depending on perspective, one may view the event either as two successive coups d'√©tat separated by a four-month intermission, or as a single coup begun on 14 May and completed with the declaration of the republic. ==Background== Both before and after Fiji gained its independence from the United Kingdom in 1970, tensions between the indigenous Fijian and Indo-Fijian ethnic groups (comprising an estimated 46% and 49% of the 1987 population, respectively) continually manifested themselves in social and political unrest. The Fijian general election of April 1987 resulted in the replacement of the indigenous- led conservative government of Prime Minister Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara with a multi-ethnic Labour-led coalition supported mostly by the Indo-Fijian plurality and Rabuka claimed ethnic Fijian concerns of racial discrimination as his excuse for seizing power. Many authorities doubt the veracity of this, however, given existing constitutional guarantees. ==Coups d'etat May coup === On the morning of 14 May, around 10 am, a section of ten masked, armed soldiers entered the Fijian House of Representatives and subdued the national legislature, which had gathered there for its morning session. Lieutenant Colonel Sitiveni Rabuka, dressed in civilian clothes, approached Prime Minister Timoci Bavadra from his position in the public gallery and ordered the members of parliament to leave the building. They did so without resisting. The coup was an apparent success and had been accomplished without loss of life. At around 11 am, Radio Fiji announced the news of the military takeover. Rabuka was reported to have gone to Government House to see the Governor-general, Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau. He was seeking recognition of the military action and the overthrow of the Bavadra government. A caretaker government was to be named shortly, and the public was urged to \\"remain calm and continue with their daily work.\\" At the meeting, the Governor-General (who was Rabuka's paramount chief) gave a mild rebuke to Rabuka. He asked him \\"What have you done?\\" and \\"You mean I have no job?\\" He added that Rabuka should have given the deposed government more time. The meeting ended with Sir Penaia stating \\"Good luck, I hope you know what you are doing.\\" Following the coup, the Governor-General commissioned a Constitution Review Committee, led by Sir John Falvey to look at the \\"deficiencies\\" of Fiji's 1970 constitution. The commission was to begin hearings on 6 July and deliver its recommendations to the Governor General by 31 July. Its terms of reference were to \\"strengthen the representation of indigenous Fijians, and in so doing bear in mind the best interests of other peoples in Fiji.\\" The Commission received 860 written and 120 oral submissions, and produced a report recommending a new unicameral legislature comprising 36 Fijians (28 elected and 8 appointed by the Great Council of Chiefs), 22 Indo-Fijians, 8 General electors, 1 Rotuman, and up to four nominees of the Prime Minister. National constituencies, ethnically allocated and elected by universal suffrage, were to be abolished, and all voting was to be communal. The Prime Minister's post was to be reserved for an indigenous Fijian. The Governor-General dissolved parliament and granted amnesty to Rabuka, while promoting him to the position of commander of the Royal Fiji Military Forces. The actions of the Governor-General were viewed with suspicion by the deposed government and Bavadra challenged Ratu Sir Penaia's decision in the Supreme Court of Fiji. === September coup === From independence in 1970, Fiji's head of state was the Queen of Fiji, Elizabeth II. The Fijian Supreme Court ruled the coup unconstitutional, and the Governor-General attempted to assert executive power. He opened negotiations known as the Deuba Talks with both the deposed government and the Alliance Party, which most indigenous Fijians supported. These negotiations culminated in the Deuba Accord of 23 September 1987, which provided for a government of national unity, in which both parties would be represented under the leadership of the Governor-General. Fearing that the gains of the first coup were about to be lost, Rabuka staged a second coup on 25 September. Rabuka then declared Fiji a republic on 7 October 1987, abrogating the Constitution of Fiji and stating that he had removed the Governor-General from office, and declaring himself Head of the Interim Military Government. Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau resigned as Governor-General on 15 October, although he was made the first President of Fiji on 6 December 1987. ==International involvement== Australia and New Zealand, the two nations with foremost political influence in the region, were somewhat disquieted by the event, but ultimately took no action to intervene. They did, however, establish a policy of non-recognition regarding the new government, suspending foreign aid in concert with the United States and the United Kingdom. The Australian labour movement, taking the ousting of a Labor Party-led government as an affront to the worldwide labour movement, instituted an embargo against shipments to Fiji. As Australia was Fiji's largest foreign trading partner, this resulted in a large diminution in Fiji's international trade. ==Aftermath== In the immediate aftermath of the second coup, the United Nations denounced the coup, demanding that the former government be restored. The Commonwealth responded with Fiji's immediate expulsion from the association. Fiji's economy contracted by as much as 7.8% between 1987 and 1988, due to a major downturn in tourism and sugar production. A new constitution was ratified in 1990, in which the offices of President and Prime Minister, along with two-thirds of the Senate, a substantial majority of the House of Representatives were reserved for indigenous Fijians. These discriminatory provisions were eventually overturned by a constitutional revision in 1997. The coups triggered much emigration by Indo-Fijians (particularly skilled workers), making them a minority by 1994.

Born and raised in Madison, Wisconsin, Schneider moved to New York City with the staff of The Onion in 2001. Her contributions include writing humor columns as a variety of characters: T. Herman Zweibel, Jean Teasdale and Herbert Kornfeld. Schneider's comic strip, Pathetic Geek Stories, illustrates tales of pain and humiliation, usually during adolescence, sent to her by readers. In 2004, Pathetic Geek Stories formally ceased to be a feature in The Onion, moving to its own website. As of September 2013, the site had not been updated since November 2008. ==Books== In 2010, The Onion Presents A Book of Jean's Own!, a book- length collection of new material written by Schneider as Jean Teasdale, was published by St. Martin's Griffin.

A hypersurface is a manifold or an algebraic variety of dimension , which is embedded in an ambient space of dimension , generally a Euclidean space, an affine space or a projective space. Hypersurfaces share, with surfaces in a three-dimensional space, the property of being defined by a single implicit equation, at least locally (near every point), and sometimes globally. A hypersurface in a (Euclidean, affine, or projective) space of dimension two is a plane curve. In a space of dimension three, it is a surface. For example, the equation :x_1^2+x_2^2+\\\\cdots+x_n^2-1=0 defines an algebraic hypersurface of dimension in the Euclidean space of dimension . This hypersurface is also a smooth manifold, and is called a hypersphere or an -sphere. ==Smooth hypersurface== A hypersurface that is a smooth manifold is called a smooth hypersurface. In , a smooth hypersurface is orientable.Hans Samelson (1969) \\"Orientability of hypersurfaces in Rn\\", Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society 22(1): 301,2 Every connected compact smooth hypersurface is a level set, and separates Rn into two connected components; this is related to the Jordan‚ÄìBrouwer separation theorem. ==Affine algebraic hypersurface == An algebraic hypersurface is an algebraic variety that may be defined by a single implicit equation of the form :p(x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n)=0, where is a multivariate polynomial. Generally the polynomial is supposed to be irreducible. When this is not the case, the hypersurface is not an algebraic variety, but only an algebraic set. It may depend on the authors or the context whether a reducible polynomial defines a hypersurface. For avoiding ambiguity, the term irreducible hypersurface is often used. As for algebraic varieties, the coefficients of the defining polynomial may belong to any fixed field , and the points of the hypersurface are the zeros of in the affine space K^n, where is an algebraically closed extension of . A hypersurface may have singularities, which are the common zeros, if any, of the defining polynomial and its partial derivatives. In particular, a real algebraic hypersurface is not necessarily a manifold. ===Properties=== Hypersurfaces have some specific properties that are not shared with other algebraic varieties. One of the main such properties is Hilbert's Nullstellensatz, which asserts that a hypersurface contains an algebraic set if and only if the defining polynomial of the hypersurface has a power that belongs to the ideal generated by the defining polynomials of the algebraic set. A corollary of this theorem is that, if two irreducible polynomials (or more generally two square-free polynomials) define the same hypersurface, then one is the product of the other by a nonzero constant. Hypersurfaces are exactly the subvarieties of dimension of an affine space of dimension of . This is the geometric interpretation of the fact that, in a polynomial ring over a field, the height of an ideal is 1 if and only if the ideal is a principal ideal. In the case of possibly reducible hypersurfaces, this result may be restated as follows: hypersurfaces are exactly the algebraic sets whose all irreducible components have dimension . ===Real and rational points === A real hypersurface is a hypersurface that is defined by a polynomial with real coefficients. In this case the algebraically closed field over which the points are defined is generally the field \\\\mathbb C of complex numbers. The real points of a real hypersurface are the points that belong to \\\\mathbb R^n \\\\subset \\\\mathbb C^n. The set of the real points of a real hypersurface is the real part of the hypersurface. Often, it is left to the context whether the term hypersurface refers to all points or only to the real part. If the coefficients of the defining polynomial belong to a field that is not algebraically closed (typically the field of rational numbers, a finite field or a number field), one says that the hypersurface is defined over , and the points that belong to k^n are rational over (in the case of the field of rational numbers, \\"over \\" is generally omitted). For example, the imaginary -sphere defined by the equation :x_0^2 +\\\\cdots+x_n^2 +1=0 is a real hypersurface without any real point, which is defined over the rational numbers. It has no rational point, but has many points that are rational over the Gaussian rationals. ==Projective algebraic hypersurface== A of dimension in a projective space of dimension over a field is defined by a homogeneous polynomial P(x_0, x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n) in indeterminates. As usual, means that all monomials of have the same degree, or, equivalently that P(cx_0, cx_1, \\\\ldots, cx_n)=c^dP(x_0, x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n) for every constant , where is the degree of the polynomial. The of the hypersurface are the points of the projective space whose projective coordinates are zeros of . If one chooses the hyperplane of equation x_0=0 as hyperplane at infinity, the complement of this hyperplane is an affine space, and the points of the projective hypersuface that belong to this affine space form an affine hypersurface of equation P(1, x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n) = 0. Conversely, given an affine hypersurface of equation p(x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n)=0, it defines a projective hypersurface, called its , whose equation is obtained by homogenizing . That is, the equation of the projective completion is P(x_0, x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n) = 0, with :P(x_0, x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n) = x_0^dp(x_1/x_0, \\\\ldots, x_n/x_0), where is the degree of . These two processes projective completion and restriction to an affine subspace are inverse one to the other. Therefore, an affine hypersurface and its projective completion have essentially the same properties, and are often considered as two points-of- view for the same hypersurface. However, it may occur that an affine hypersurface is nonsingular, while its projective completion has singular points. In this case, one says that the affine surface is . For example, the circular cylinder of equation :x^2+y^2-1=0 in the affine space of dimension three has a unique singular point, which is at infinity, in the direction . ==See also== * Affine sphere * Coble hypersurface * Dwork family * Null hypersurface * Polar hypersurface ==References== * * Shoshichi Kobayashi and Katsumi Nomizu (1969), Foundations of Differential Geometry Vol II, Wiley Interscience * P.A.

Ettinger founded the Cryonics Institute and the related Immortalist Society and until 2003 served as the groups' president. His body has been cryopreserved, like the bodies of his first and second wives, and his mother. ==Personal background== Ettinger was born in Atlantic City, New Jersey, the son of Russian Jewish immigrants. Raised Jewish, he later became an atheist. He served as a second lieutenant infantryman in the United States Army during World War II. Severely wounded in battle in Germany, he received the Purple Heart and recovered after several years spent in a Michigan hospital. He earned two master's degrees from Wayne State University (one in physics, one in mathematics) and spent his working career teaching physics and mathematics at both Wayne State University and Highland Park Community college in Michigan. Ettinger had two children with his first wife, Elaine, David (1951) and Shelley (1954). David gave his first cryonics interview to journalists at the age of 12 and was an attorney. He served as legal counsel to the Cryonics Institute and the Immortalist Society. Robert Ettinger's daughter, who has had no interest in cryonics, is a writer and revolutionary socialist. Ettinger met his second wife, Mae Junod, in 1962 when she attended one of his adult education courses in basic physics. Junod typed and assisted with editing the manuscripts for both The Prospect of Immortality and Man into Superman. She became active in the Cryonics Society of Michigan (CSM) and edited and was production manager for the CSM monthly newsletter, The Outlook. In the 1970s The Outlook was renamed The Immortalist and Junod continued editorship until the mid-1990s. The Outlook is the longest continuously published cryonics magazine. Junod was an author, feminist, and marriage counselor. Ettinger married Junod in 1988 after the death of his first wife. Ettinger described his time with Junod as one of the most satisfying and tranquil times in his life. The couple moved to Scottsdale, Arizona in 1995 and enjoyed a period of domestic life during which time the couple began to ease into retirement from over 30 years of cryonics activism and the attendant burdens of work and controversy. Mae Ettinger suffered a debilitating stroke in 1998 from which she never fully recovered followed by a lethal stroke in 2000, which resulted in her cryopreservation. Ettinger died on July 23, 2011 in Detroit, Michigan of natural causes, and was cryopreserved. ==Roots of cryonics in science fiction== Ettinger grew up reading Hugo Gernsback's Amazing Stories. Ettinger was particularly affected when he was 12 years old by a Neil R. Jones story, \\"The Jameson Satellite,\\" which appeared in the July 1931 issue of Amazing Stories, in which one Professor Jameson had his corpse sent into earth orbit where (as the author mistakenly thought) it would remain preserved indefinitely at near absolute zero. And so it did, in the story, until millions of years later, when, with humanity extinct, a race of mechanical men with organic brains chanced upon it. They revived and repaired Jameson's brain, installed it in a mechanical body, and he became one of their company. Ettinger assumed that one day ‚Äî long before he grew old ‚Äî biologists would learn the secret of eternal youth. As he grew out of boyhood in the 1930s, he began to suspect it might take a little longer since no scientists were yet working on this particular endeavor. If immortality is achievable through the ministrations of technologically advanced aliens repairing a frozen human corpse, then Ettinger thought everyone could be cryopreserved to await later rescue by our own medically more sophisticated descendants. ==Launching the cryonics movement== Ettinger waited expectantly for prominent scientists or physicians to come to the same conclusion he had, and to take a position of public advocacy. By 1960, Ettinger finally made the scientific case for the idea, which had always been in the back of his mind. Ettinger was 42 years old and said he was increasingly aware of his own mortality. In what has been characterized as an historically important mid-life crisis, Ettinger summarized the idea of cryonics in a few pages, with the emphasis on life insurance, and sent this to approximately 200 people whom he selected from Who's Who in America. The response was very small, and it was clear that a much longer exposition was needed ‚Äî mostly to counter cultural bias. Ettinger correctly saw that people, even the intellectually, financially and socially distinguished, would have to be educated into understanding his belief that dying is usually gradual and could be a reversible process, and that freezing damage is so limited (even though fatal by present criteria) that its reversibility demands relatively little in future progress. Ettinger soon made an even more troubling discovery, principally that \\"a great many people have to be coaxed into admitting that life is better than death, healthy is better than sick, smart is better than stupid, and immortality might be worth the trouble!\\" In 1962, Ettinger privately published a preliminary version of The Prospect of Immortality, in which he said that future technological advances could be used to bring people back to life. This finally attracted attention of a major publisher, which sent a copy to Isaac Asimov; Asimov said that the science behind cryonics was sound, and the manuscript was approved for a 1964 Doubleday hardcover and various subsequent editions which launched cryonics. The book became a selection of the Book of the Month Club and was published in nine languages. Ettinger became an \\"overnight\\" media celebrity, discussed in The New York Times, Time, Newsweek, Paris Match, Der Spiegel, Christian Century, and dozens of other periodicals. He appeared on television with David Frost, Johnny Carson, Steve Allen, and others. Ettinger also spoke on radio programs coast-to-coast to promote the idea of human cryopreservation. Since the commercial publication of The Prospect of Immortality, all those active in cryonics today can trace their involvement, directly or indirectly, to the publication of one or both of Ettinger's books. While Ettinger was the first, most articulate, and most scientifically credible person to argue the idea of cryonics, he was not the only one. In 1962, Evan Cooper had authored a manuscript entitled Immortality: Scientifically, Physically, Now under the pseudonym Nathan Duhring. Cooper's book contained the same argument as did Ettinger's, but it lacked both scientific and technical rigor and was not of publication quality. ==Books by Ettinger== *The Prospect of Immortality (1962, 1964 & later editions) **Available online at The Prospect of Immortality *Man into Superman (1972 & later editions) **Available online at Man Into Superman *Youniverse (new edition, 2009) **Available at Youniverse ==References== Category:1918 births Category:American atheists Category:American army personnel of World War II Category:Jewish atheists Category:Wayne State University alumni Category:Wayne State University faculty Category:Life extensionists Category:2011 deaths Category:United States Army officers Category:Cryonically preserved people Category:American people of Russian- Jewish descent Category:American transhumanists Category:People from Clinton, Macomb County, Michigan Category:Cryonicists ","title":"Robert Ettinger"},{"id":"525124","text":"Drug overdose is the ingestion or application of a medication or other substance in a quantity greater than that recommended.

It was developed and built by the British aircraft manufacturer Fairey Aviation Company. Development of the Firefly can be traced back to pair of specifications issued by the British Air Ministry in 1938, calling for new naval fighter designs. Designed to the contemporary FAA concept of a two-seat fleet reconnaissance/fighter, the pilot and observer were positioned at separate stations. In flight, the Firefly was superior in terms of both performance and firepower to its predecessor, the Fairey Fulmar. Due to a protracted development, the type only entered operational service towards the end of the conflict, at which point it was no longer competitive as a fighter. The limitations of a single engine in a relatively heavy airframe reduced its performance, but the Firefly proved to be a fairly sturdy, long-ranged, and docile aircraft during carrier operations. The Fairey Firefly served in the Second World War as a fleet fighter. During the post-war era, it was soon superseded in the fighter role by the arrival of more modern jet aircraft, thus the Firefly was adapted to perform in other roles, including strike operations and anti-submarine warfare. In these capacities, it remained a mainstay of the FAA until the mid-1950s. Both British and Australian Fireflies routinely performed ground‚Äìattack operations from various aircraft carriers during the Korean War. In foreign service, the type was in operation with the naval air arms of Australia, Canada, India and the Netherlands. As late as 1962, Dutch Fireflies were used to carry out attack sorties against Indonesian infiltrators in Dutch New Guinea. Its final uses were in various secondary roles, such as trainers, target tugs and drone aircraft. ==Design and development== During 1938, by which point British authorities were preparing for the likelihood of a major conflict, the Air Ministry issued a pair of specifications calling for naval fighters, a conventional and a \\"turret fighter\\". The performance requirements for both was to be able to attain a speed of 275 knots while flying at 15,000 ft and carrying an armament, for the conventional fighter, of eight 0.303 Browning machine guns or four 20mm Hispano cannon. This aircraft would replace the Fairey Fulmar, which had been viewed as an interim design. These specifications were updated during the following year, while several British manufacturers tendered their ideas. Further changes to the official specification followed, such as the turret fighter specification being eliminated entirely, while a modified specification was issued to cover single and dual-seat fighters capable of 330 and 300 knots respectively. Fairey offered designs that could accommodate either a single or twin-seat arrangements, either powered by the Rolls-Royce Griffon engine, or combining a larger airframe with a Napier Sabre engine. After consideration of the manufacturer's responses, Specification N.5/40 replaced the earlier specifications. Due to the necessity of navigating over open sea, it was decided to opt for a two-seater aircraft alone.Buttler 2004 . For defence of naval bases, a separate single seater design would lead to the Blackburn Firebrand.Buttler, Tony. Blackburn Firebrand ‚Äì Warpaint Number 56. Denbigh East, Bletchley, UK: Warpaint Books Ltd., 2000. . The Firefly was designed by H.E. Chaplin at Fairey Aviation; the design team reportedly used the Fulmar as a starting point.Dunstan, Kim. \\"Heritage ‚Äì The Fairey Firefly.\\" Fleet Air Arm Association of Australia, Retrieved: 39 June 2019. During June 1940, the Admiralty placed an initial order for 200 aircraft \\"off the drawing board\\", the first three of which were to function as prototypes. On 22 December 1941, the first prototype of the Firefly performed its maiden flight.Thetford 1978, p. 164. Although the aircraft was 4,000 lb (1,810 kg) heavier than the preceding Fulmar (largely due to the adoption of the heavier Griffon engine and the armament of two 20 mm Hispano cannon in each wing), the Firefly was 40 mph (60 km/h) faster due to improved aerodynamics, as well as the increased power of the Griffon IIB engine, being capable of generating a maximum of 1,735 hp (1,294 kW). The Firefly was a low-wing cantilever monoplane, featuring an oval-section metal semi-monocoque fuselage and a conventional tail unit with forward-placed tailplane. It was powered by a Rolls-Royce Griffon liquid-cooled piston engine, which drove a four-blade Rotol-built propeller. A large chin-mounted radiator was present to provide cooling for the engine. The Firefly had retractable main undercarriage and tail wheel, the hydraulically-actuated main landing gear retracting inwards into the underside of the wing centre-section. This undercarriage was widely- set, a highly useful feature for carrier landings. The aircraft was also fitted with a retractable arrester hook mounted underneath the rear fuselage. The pilot's cockpit was located above the leading edge of the wing while the observer/radio-operator/navigator was positioned aft of the wing's trailing edge; these positions provided for better visibility for operating and landing. Both crew were provided with separate jettisonable canopies. The Firefly was equipped with an all-metal wing which could be folded manually, the wings ending up along the sides of the fuselage when folded; when in the flying position, the wings were hydraulically locked in place.Bridgman 1988, pp. 118‚Äì119. The wing itself featured square tips and large Fairey-Youngman flaps, which provided relatively good handling while flown at low speeds.\\"A Servicing Innovation: Details of a Recent Modification to the Fairey Firefly.\\" Aircraft Engineering and Aerospace Technology, 1950. Vol. 22 Issue: 3, pp. 84‚Äì84. A total of four 20mm cannon were buried within the wings, which was considered to be relatively heavy armament for the era. According to pilots, the general handling of the Firefly was relatively well-balanced, but a level of physical strength was required to effectively execute aerobatics. During 1942, handling and performance trials were first undertaken at RAF Boscombe Down; by 1944, the Firefly had been cleared to use underwing rocket projectiles and, by April 1944, tests involving a double-underwing load of 16 rockets and a pair of 45 gallon (205 l) drop tanks still provided acceptable handling.Mason 1998, p. 277. Further testing with two 90 gallon (410 l) drop tanks or two 1,000 lb (454 kg) bombs deemed acceptable albeit with \\"...a small adverse effect on handling...\\" while \\"...handling with a single 1,000 lb (454 kg) bomb was unpleasant, but manageable.\\" Performance trials at 11,830 lb (5,366 kg) indicated a maximum speed of 315 mph (508 km/h) at 16,800 ft (5,121 m); a climb to 20,000 ft (6,096 m) took 12.4 minutes, along with a maximum climb rate of 2,140 fpm (10.87 m/s) at 3,800 ft (1,158 m), and a service ceiling of 30,100 ft (9,174 m).Mason 1998, p. 306. ==Operational history== Firefly FR.4 of the Netherlands Navy in 1952 Firefly U.8 target drone aircraft in 1955 The primary variant of the aircraft used during the Second World War was the Firefly Mk I, which was operated in all theatres of operation. During March 1943, the first Firefly Mk Is were delivered to the FAA; however, these did not enter operational service until July 1944, at which point they equipped 1770 Naval Air Squadron aboard . The first operations were flown in the European theatre where Fireflies carried out numerous armed reconnaissance flights and anti-shipping strikes along the Norwegian coast. That same year, Fireflies also provided air cover and aerial reconnaissance during strikes on the German battleship .\\"Fairey Firefly FR.1.\\" Ingenium, Retrieved: 29 June 2019. Throughout its operational career, the Firefly took on increasingly demanding roles from fighter to anti-submarine warfare while being stationed mainly with the British Pacific Fleet in the Far East and Pacific theatres. In these theatres, the type was interchangeably used against both Japanese ground targets and fighter aircraft. FAA Fireflies carried out attacks on oil refineries and airfields; it was repeatedly dispatched against several Japanese-controlled islands up until Victory over Japan Day. The Firefly gained a level of public renown when the type became the first British- designed and -built aircraft to overfly the Japanese capital of Tokyo.Thetford 1978, p. 168.Fredriksen 2001, p. 108. During May 1945, in anticipation of a major naval offensive against the Japanese mainland, the Canadian government accepted a British offer to loan a pair of Colossus-class aircraft carriers to the Royal Canadian Navy.Pigott 2005, p. 114. To equip these carriers, it was necessary to procure naval fighters; based upon the feedback of veteran pilots, Canada opted to acquire the Firefly over opposition that favoured procuring American aircraft instead. As a stop-gap measure, Royal Navy Fireflies were loaned while more advanced purpose-built aircraft were being constructed.Pigott 2005, pp. 114‚Äì115. Between 1946 and 1954, the Canadian Navy employed 65 Fireflies of the Mk AS 5 type onboard its own aircraft carriers; the service also flew a handful of Mk I Fireflies; during the 1950s, Canada decided to sell several of its Fireflies, buyers included the armed forces of Ethiopia, Denmark, and the Netherlands.Pigott 2005, p. 115. After the Second World War, the Firefly remained in front line service with the Fleet Air Arm, continuing in this capacity until the mid-1950s. During this time, British- built Fireflies were also supplied to a number of overseas nations, including Canada, Australia, Denmark, Ethiopia, the Netherlands, India and Thailand. During 1947, the Australian government approved of formation of the Royal Australian Fleet Air Arm and the acquisition of a pair of Majestic class aircraft carriers from Britain. Following a consultation with the Royal Navy, the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) opted to procure both the Firefly and the Hawker Sea Fury to equip its new aircraft carriers. These two types formed the backbone of the newly-formed Australian Carrier Air Groups (CAGs), which would operate a total fleet size of 108 Fireflies, acquired across multiple orders. During May 1949, the first aircraft was delivered; the final Firefly arrived during August 1953. Early RAN operations revolved around aircrew training ahead of achieving operational status during 1950. During the Korean War of the 1950s, both British and Australian Fireflies carried out anti-shipping patrols and ground strikes from various aircraft carriers positioned offshore.Smith 2008, p. 359. Additional missions roles including anti- submarine patrols and aerial observation, as well as assisting battleships in providing effective naval gunfire support. Numerous FAA Fireflies were loaned to the Australian Navy during the conflict as many of its aircraft did not feature cannons when configured for anti-submarine warfare. Despite several incidents of aircraft being struck by anti-aircraft fire, the Firefly provided to be relatively rugged. The type was routinely used for strike operations against targets such as bridges and railway lines to damage North Korean logistics and communications; as the war went on, pilots developed new low- level dive-bombing techniques to achieve greater accuracy. Combat use of the Firefly in the theatre continued until the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement on 27 July 1953, although post-armistice patrols involving the type continued for several years afterwards.\\"Fairey Firefly AS.5/AS.6.\\" navy.gov.au, Retrieved: 29 June 2019. FAA Fireflies were again deployed in the Far East amid the Malayan Emergency, where it was used conduct to ground- attack operations against Malayan Communist Party insurgents. The Firefly's front line career with the FAA came to an end shortly following the introduction of the newer and larger Fairey Gannet, which effectively replaced the type. The RAN also decided to relegate their Fireflies to secondary duties following the adoption of newer aircraft, such as the Gannet and the jet- powered de Havilland Sea Venom. Several versions of the type were developed later in its career to serve in a number of secondary roles, including as trainers, target tugs and drone aircraft. As an example, the Indian Navy acquired a batch of 10 aircraft during the mid-50s for target tug purposes.\\"Fairey Firefly TT.1 & TT.4.\\" bharatrakshak.com. Retrieved: 9 August 2010. By the end of the 1950s, many operators were disposing of their remaining Fireflies, typically as scrap. In the late 1940s, the Royal Netherlands Navy deployed a Firefly squadron to the Dutch East Indies, as part of the forces countering Indonesian nationalists. When talks broke down in July 1947, the Dutch launched multiple air strikes. Three Fireflies were shot down by ground fire.Oliver, D. British Combat Aircraft in action since 1945 1987 pp17-18 During 1960, in response to territorial demands and threats issued by Indonesia, the Netherlands chose to deploy a number of Firefly AS.Mk 4s to Dutch New Guinea. As Indonesian forces began to infiltrate the territory, the Fireflies carried out attack operations during early 1962; these strikes continued until a political settlement was negotiated between the two countries.Bishop and Moeng 1997, p. 73. ==Variants== ; Firefly I / FR.I : Two variants of the Mk I Firefly were built; 429 \\"fighter\\" \\"Firefly F Mk I\\"s, built by Fairey and General Aircraft Ltd, and 376 \\"fighter/reconnaissance\\" Firefly \\"FR Mk I\\"s (which were fitted with the ASH detection radar).

WB518 was then purchased by American Eddie Kurdziel, a Northwest Airlines captain and former U.S. Navy pilot. WD518 was extensively restored and made its first public appearance at Oshkosh in 2002. Restoration of WD518 used parts salvaged from WD828 which was written off after a crash into a cabbage field in Camden, New South Wales in 1987.WB518 as of July 2015 was then undergoing extensive rebuilding and is now in flying condition out of Gillespie Field, El Cajon, California. Other survivors include ‚Äì in Australia: * AS 5 VX388 is owned by the currently closed to public access Camden Museum of Aviation at Harrington Park, New South Wales. * AS 6 WD826 is displayed at the Royal Australian Navy's Fleet Air Arm Museum (Australia). This Firefly was restored to airworthy condition in the 1980s and flew for three years before its return to the museum. * AS 6 WD827 which was once owned by the Australian Air League, Blacktown, New South Wales, is now on display in the Australian National Aviation Museum, Melbourne, Victoria. * AS 6 WD828 is displayed on a pole outside the Returned Services Leagues Club in Griffith, Australia. It has been repainted as WB518 which was the original aircraft displayed in Griffith but is now the flying example restored by Captain Kurdziel. The swap was made in 1991. * AS 6 WJ109 is stored for eventual exhibition at the Australian War Memorial, Canberra. This aircraft was previously at the Fleet Air Arm Museum (Australia), Nowra, New South Wales. The Royal Thai Air Force Museum in Bangkok, Thailand has a Firefly Mk I on display.\\"Building 1: Aircraft flown by RTAF after WW2.\\" Royal Thai Air Force Museum. Retrieved: 10 April 2012. A sole remaining Firefly of the 10 acquired by India is displayed at the Naval Aviation Museum in Goa. Two ex-Swedish Fireflies moved to IWM Duxford, Cambridgeshire in 2003. Acquired by the Aircraft Restoration Company, they were in Royal Navy service from 1944 and 1946, and then converted to target tugs for gunnery training in 1950 and 1954. One is being restored to flying condition, and the other was traded to the Aviodrome Museum in the Netherlands for a Spitfire. As well as the Canadian Warplane Heritage's ex-Australian Firefly, two other Fireflies are known to exist in Canada: one is at the Canada Aviation and Space Museum in Ottawa and another is being restored at the Shearwater Aviation Museum at Eastern Passage (near Dartmouth), Nova Scotia. Both are Mk I models that served in the Canadian Navy from 1946 to 1954, after which they were sold to the Ethiopian Air Force. Following their discovery in the Ethiopian desert in 1993, they were repatriated to Canada in exchange for medical supplies. AS 6 WD833, another ex-Australian Firefly, is owned by Henry \\"Butch\\" Schroeder who moved the aircraft to Danville, Illinois, USA for restoration. The present whereabouts of this aircraft are unclear. ==Specifications (Mk.4 / Mk.5 / Mk.6)== thumb ==See also== ==ReferencesCitations=Bibliography=== * Bridgman, Leonard.

The tribe lived in modern Dorset, south Wiltshire, south Somerset and Devon east of the River Axe and the discovery of an Iron Age hoard in 2009 at Shalfleet, Isle of Wight gives evidence that they lived in the western half of the island. After the Roman conquest, their main civitates, or settlement-centred administrative units, were Durnovaria (modern Dorchester, \\"the probable original capital\\") and Lindinis (modern Ilchester, \\"whose former, unknown status was thereby enhanced\\"Bruce Eagles, \\"Britons and Saxons on the Eastern Boundary of the Civitas Durotrigum\\" Britannia 35 (2004:234-240) p. 234.). Their territory was bordered to the west by the Dumnonii; and to the east by the Belgae.__NOTOC__ == Etymology == The tribe's name can probably be broken down into two parts. 'Duro' may come from 'dubro', which derives from the British word for water ('dour' or 'dwr'), although it is much more likely to be 'duro', which means 'hard', and 'trig' means inhabitant. That would produce something along the lines of 'the inhabitants of the hard [ground]' or the 'hill-top dwellers'. Both meanings would seem to be very appropriate for the chalky soil of the Dorset Downs and the region's many hill forts. However, it is unknown if the tribe referred to themselves as the Durotriges before they arrived in the area now known as Dorset.British Celts, gold stater from the Durotriges. Chute type with strongly Celticized, disjointed horse left and abstract head of Apollo on the right. == Territory == The area of the Durotriges is identified in part by coin finds:Cunliffe 2005: fig. 8:2. few Durotrigan coins are found in the \\"core\\" area, where they were apparently unacceptable and were reminted. To their north and east were the Belgae, beyond the Avon and its tributary Wylye: \\"the ancient division is today reflected in the county division between Wiltshire and Somerset.\\"Eagles 2004: 234 and map, fig. 5. Their main outlet for the trade across the Channel, strong in the first half of the 1st century BC, when the potter's wheel was introduced, then drying up in the decades before the advent of the Romans, was at Hengistbury Head. Numismatic evidence shows progressive debasing of the coinage, suggesting economic retrenchment accompanying the increased cultural isolation. Analysis of the body of Durotrigan ceramics suggests to Cunliffe that the production was increasingly centralised, at Poole Harbour (Cunliffe 2005:183). The Durotriges were more a tribal confederation than a tribe.\\"The Durotriges were a close-knit confederacy of smaller units centred on modern Dorset,\\" writes Barry Cunliffe, Iron Age Communities in Britain: An Account of England, Scotland and Wales from the Seventh Century BC Until the Roman Conquest, 4th ed. 2005:178, in beginning his Part II.8 \\"The tribes of the periphery: Durotriges, Dobunni, Iceni and Corieltauvi\\" (pp 178-201). They were one of the groups that issued coinage before the Roman conquest, part of the cultural \\"periphery\\", as Barry Cunliffe characterised them, round the \\"core group\\" of Britons in the south. These coins were rather simple and had no inscriptions, and thus no names of coin-issuers can be known, let alone evidence about monarchs or rulers. Nevertheless, the Durotriges presented a settled society, based in the farming of landsSeveral homestead sites have been excavated in Cranborne Chase. surrounded and controlled by strong hill forts that were still in use in 43 AD. Maiden Castle is a preserved example of one of these hill forts. == Settlements == The destruction of the Durotriges' ruling families and the extent of Romanisation makes documenting the names of settlements and hillforts occupied by the Durotriges before the Roman conquest difficult, but from a variety of sources several settlements are known. Ptolemy's Geography lists Dunium, speculated to be Hengistbury Head, as an important tribal centre near their Belgae neighbours, but it is unknown whether if it was considered the capital of the tribal confederation, especially as several other settlements appear to be equally important from archaeological evidence. Known places of pre-conquest settlement include: *Woolsbarrow Hillfort *Maiden Castle *Cadbury Castle *Ham Hill *Abbotsbury Castle, Allington, Dorset, *Badbury Rings, Banbury Hill, Bindon Hill, Buzbury Rings *Chalbury Hillfort, Coney's Castle, *Dungeon Hill, *Eggardon Hill, *Flower's Barrow, *Hambledon Hill, Hod Hill, *Lambert's Castle, Lewesdon Hill, *Pilsdon Pen, Poundbury Hill *Rawlsbury Camp *Duropolis == Culture == Burial of Durotriges was by inhumation, with a last ritual meal provided even under exiguous circumstances, as in the eight burials at Maiden Castle, carried out immediately after the Roman attack. Most Durotrigian burials are laid down in crouched positions within shallow, oval graves. One such inhumation of a young Durotrigian woman was found at Langton Herring in Dorset in 2010. The burial, which was laid down with a decorated mirror, had a radiocarbon date of between AD 25 ‚Äì 53. Not surprisingly, the Durotriges resisted Roman invasion in AD 43, and the historian Suetonius records some fights between the tribe and the second legion Augusta, then commanded by Vespasian. By 70 AD, the tribe was already Romanised and securely included in the Roman province of Britannia. In the tribe‚Äôs area, the Romans explored some quarries and supported a local pottery industry.

The Durotriges, and their relationship with the Roman Empire, form the basis for an ongoing archaeological research project directed by Paul Cheetham, Ellen Hambleton and Miles Russell of Bournemouth University. The Durotriges Project* has, since 2009, been reconsidering the Iron Age to Roman transition through a detailed programme of field survey, geophysical investigation and targeted excavation. To date the programme of work has concentrated upon an enclosed late Iron Age banjo enclosure containing round houses, work surfaces and storage pits, a Late Iron Age cemetery and two Roman villas.Cheetham, P, Hambleton, E, Russell, M, and Smith, M 2013 'Digging the Durotriges' CURRENT ARCHAEOLOGY 281, 36-41Maiden Castle, Dorset was in the territory of the Durotriges ==See also== *Abbotsbury Castle *Castle Rings, Wiltshire *List of Celtic tribes ==Notes== ==Further reading== *Martin Papworth, (2011), The Search for the Durotriges: Dorset and the West Country in the Late Iron Age.

For affine and projective algebraic varieties, the codimension equals the height of the defining ideal. For this reason, the height of an ideal is often called its codimension. The dual concept is relative dimension. ==Definition== Codimension is a relative concept: it is only defined for one object inside another. There is no ‚Äúcodimension of a vector space (in isolation)‚Äù, only the codimension of a vector subspace. If W is a linear subspace of a finite-dimensional vector space V, then the codimension of W in V is the difference between the dimensions: :\\\\operatorname{codim}(W) = \\\\dim(V) - \\\\dim(W). It is the complement of the dimension of W, in that, with the dimension of W, it adds up to the dimension of the ambient space V: :\\\\dim(W) + \\\\operatorname{codim}(W) = \\\\dim(V). Similarly, if N is a submanifold or subvariety in M, then the codimension of N in M is :\\\\operatorname{codim}(N) = \\\\dim(M) - \\\\dim(N). Just as the dimension of a submanifold is the dimension of the tangent bundle (the number of dimensions that you can move on the submanifold), the codimension is the dimension of the normal bundle (the number of dimensions you can move off the submanifold). More generally, if W is a linear subspace of a (possibly infinite dimensional) vector space V then the codimension of W in V is the dimension (possibly infinite) of the quotient space V/W, which is more abstractly known as the cokernel of the inclusion. For finite-dimensional vector spaces, this agrees with the previous definition :\\\\operatorname{codim}(W) = \\\\dim(V/W) = \\\\dim \\\\operatorname{coker} ( W \\\\to V ) = \\\\dim(V) - \\\\dim(W), and is dual to the relative dimension as the dimension of the kernel. Finite-codimensional subspaces of infinite-dimensional spaces are often useful in the study of topological vector spaces. ==Additivity of codimension and dimension counting== The fundamental property of codimension lies in its relation to intersection: if W1 has codimension k1, and W2 has codimension k2, then if U is their intersection with codimension j we have :max (k1, k2) ‚â§ j ‚â§ k1 \\\\+ k2. In fact j may take any integer value in this range. This statement is more perspicuous than the translation in terms of dimensions, because the RHS is just the sum of the codimensions. In words :codimensions (at most) add. :If the subspaces or submanifolds intersect transversally (which occurs generically), codimensions add exactly. This statement is called dimension counting, particularly in intersection theory. ==Dual interpretation== In terms of the dual space, it is quite evident why dimensions add. The subspaces can be defined by the vanishing of a certain number of linear functionals, which if we take to be linearly independent, their number is the codimension. Therefore, we see that U is defined by taking the union of the sets of linear functionals defining the Wi. That union may introduce some degree of linear dependence: the possible values of j express that dependence, with the RHS sum being the case where there is no dependence. This definition of codimension in terms of the number of functions needed to cut out a subspace extends to situations in which both the ambient space and subspace are infinite dimensional. In other language, which is basic for any kind of intersection theory, we are taking the union of a certain number of constraints. We have two phenomena to look out for: # the two sets of constraints may not be independent; # the two sets of constraints may not be compatible. The first of these is often expressed as the principle of counting constraints: if we have a number N of parameters to adjust (i.e. we have N degrees of freedom), and a constraint means we have to 'consume' a parameter to satisfy it, then the codimension of the solution set is at most the number of constraints. We do not expect to be able to find a solution if the predicted codimension, i.e. the number of independent constraints, exceeds N (in the linear algebra case, there is always a trivial, null vector solution, which is therefore discounted). The second is a matter of geometry, on the model of parallel lines; it is something that can be discussed for linear problems by methods of linear algebra, and for non-linear problems in projective space, over the complex number field. ==In geometric topology== Codimension also has some clear meaning in geometric topology: on a manifold, codimension 1 is the dimension of topological disconnection by a submanifold, while codimension 2 is the dimension of ramification and knot theory. In fact, the theory of high- dimensional manifolds, which starts in dimension 5 and above, can alternatively be said to start in codimension 3, because higher codimensions avoid the phenomenon of knots. Since surgery theory requires working up to the middle dimension, once one is in dimension 5, the middle dimension has codimension greater than 2, and hence one avoids knots. This quip is not vacuous: the study of embeddings in codimension 2 is knot theory, and difficult, while the study of embeddings in codimension 3 or more is amenable to the tools of high-dimensional geometric topology, and hence considerably easier. ==See also== *Glossary of differential geometry and topology ==References== * Category:Algebraic geometry Category:Geometric topology Category:Linear algebra Category:Dimension ","title":"Codimension"},{"id":"525151","text":"Diane Dufresne, (born 30 September 1944) is a French Canadian singer and painter, and is known for singing a large repertoire of popular Quebec songs.

The album was credited with connecting the band, known for its jam band concerts and devoted cult following, with a more mainstream audience. The first single, \\"Free\\", was the band's most successful song on two Billboard rock charts, peaking at #11 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks Chart and at #24 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks Chart. Billy Breathes was produced by Steve Lillywhite and recorded at Bearsville Studios in Bearsville, New York between February and June 1996, following Phish's landmark fall 1995 tour. The songs \\"Free\\", \\"Taste\\", \\"Cars Trucks Buses\\", \\"Theme from the Bottom\\", \\"Billy Breathes\\" and \\"Prince Caspian\\" were debuted in concert by Phish over the course of 1995, with the remaining songs not appearing in the band's concert repertoire until after the album's release. \\"Bliss\\" was not played live by the band until December 30, 2018, 22 years after the release of the album. The album and its title song were named after guitarist Trey Anastasio's daughter Isabella, who was nicknamed \\"Billy\\" as an infant. The album's cover is a close-up shot of bass guitar player Mike Gordon, the first time that any member of Phish had appeared on an album cover. Phish frontman Trey Anastasio recalled in a 1997 interview that the cover came together very quickly on the last day of recording. Upon release, Rolling Stone said that Billy Breathes is \\"a quiet gem of an album\\" that confirms Phish \\"is much more than a jam band from Burlington, Vermont.\\"Gehr, Richard. Billy Breathes Review. Rolling Stone. Online. Accessed: August 23, 2011. The album was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America on January 8, 1999. The album was reissued on LP by Phish's label JEMP Records for Record Store Day in 2018. == Recording == Early song ideas came from a scuba diving trip that Trey Anastasio and Tom Marshall went on in the Cayman Islands in January 1996. They then produced a demo which was given to the other band members at the start of the Billy Breathes sessions. Other songs such as \\"Free\\" and \\"Taste\\" had already been in the band's live rotation since 1995. The album was recorded between February and June 1996 at the now defunct Bearsville Studios in the Catskills region of New York state. Early recording started February 1, with the band intending to produce the album themselves with engineering by John Siket. The first recording project was an attempt to create a sonic \\"blob\\" that filled an entire reel of tape. Each band member contributed on several instruments. This idea was later abandoned but elements were used on the tracks \\"Swept Away\\" and \\"Steep\\". Rough mixes of songs were made after recording for most of February and March. The band took a break from recording beginning on March 20, and each listened to the rough mixes during their time off. Rough mixes included the songs \\"Free\\", \\"Grind\\", two versions of \\"Strange Design\\", \\"Swept Away/Steep\\", \\"Talk\\", \\"Waste\\" and \\"Weekly Time\\". Phish performed at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival in April and then returned to Bearsville on May 1 to resume recording.Kevin Shapiro Phish.com. This Month In Phish History (February‚ÄìJune 1996). Accessed: July 9, 2012. With the resumption of recording, Steve Lillywhite joined as producer on the recommendation of Dave Matthews. Lillywhite had never heard of Phish before he joined the Billy Breathes sessions. He reflected in February 2011: > \\"Phish, for me, are the musical equivalent of watching a flock of birds fly > across the sky: They don't scatter every which way, but rather, they move > with each other; they dip and dive, they go up and down; but at all times, > they seem to have this radar, this instinct, for where the bird in front or > in back of them is going. Musically, each member of Phish knows what the > other is doing, which then carries over to the whole. The band can play > anything, which then raises the question: Well, what should they play? With > Billy Breathes, it's the closest they got to making what I would say is a > good stoner album. You know what I mean: you put on the CD, you fire up a > big one and you just go down that road.

Production legend Steve > Lillywhite on 16 career defining records: No. 15 Musicradar.com. Online. > Accessed: August 24, 2011. After Lillywhite joined, many of the songs were recorded in the early morning hours. \\"We did a lot of that album at five in the morning, when the sun was coming up. It kind of sounds like that, especially the stuff on side two like 'Billy Breathes' and 'Prince Caspian', 'Swept Away' all that stuff was recorded as the sun was coming up,\\" said Trey in a 1997 interview. On June 6, 1996, near the end of the sessions, the band played a surprise show in the neighboring town of Woodstock at a local bar called Joyous Lake. In a 2011 interview, Anastasio recalled his method for composing the guitar solo for the track \\"Billy Breathes\\": > On the song \\"Billy Breathes\\" there's a guitar solo I like a lot. That's a > composed solo. I didn't labor over it. What I did is, I walked around the > kitchen‚Äîmy daughter had just been born and we were living out in the woods > in Vermont.

The song \\"Strange Design\\", which the band had been playing live since May 1995, was recorded during the Billy Breathes sessions but was left off the album. The band recorded several versions of the track before settling on a final version. This was later included on the Free European single CD release. Phish lyricist Tom Marshall spoke of the \\"Strange Design\\" outtake in 1996: > \\"It was scrapped at the last second.

AD 43) was king of the British Catuvellauni tribe, whose capital was at St. Albans, at the time of the Roman conquest. He can probably be identified with the legendary British king Guiderius. He is usually thought to have led the fight against the Romans alongside his brother, but to have been killed early in the campaign. However, some authorities now argue that he sided with the Romans and is one and the same person as the client-king Tiberius Claudius Cogidubnus, whose original name may have been Togidubnus or Togodumnus. ==Career== Togodumnus is known only from Cassius Dio's Roman History, according to which he was a son of Cunobelinus.Cassius Dio, Roman History 60.20-21 He probably succeeded his father to the kingship of the Catuvellauni, who were the dominant kingdom in the south-east of Britain at this time. Their territory took in the lands of several other nations, including their neighbours the Trinovantes, and possibly the Dobunni further west. He had two notable brothers, Adminius and Caratacus. In Cunobelinus's later days Adminius gained control of the Cantiaci in Kent, but was driven from Britain in 40 AD, seeking refuge with the Roman emperor Caligula. Caligula planned an invasion of Britain in response, but called it off at the last minute.Suetonius, Caligula 44-46; Dio Cassius, Roman History 59.25 Based on coin distribution it appears that Caratacus, following in the footsteps of his uncle Epaticcus, completed the conquest of the Atrebates, the main rival to the Catuvellauni, in the early 40s.John Creighton, Coins and power in Late Iron Age Britain, Cambridge University Press, 2000; Philip de Jersey (1996), Celtic Coinage in Britain, Shire Archaeology The Atrebatian king, Verica, fled to Rome and gave the new emperor, Claudius, a pretext to conquer Britain in 43.Cassius Dio, Roman History 60:19 ==Death== According to Dio's account, Togodumnus led the initial resistance to the invasion alongside Caratacus, but was killed after the battle on the Thames. The Roman commander Aulus Plautius then dug in at the Thames and sent word for Claudius to join him for the final march on the Catuvellaunian capital, Camulodunum (Colchester). Dio says that this was because the resistance became fiercer as the Britons tried to avenge Togodumnus, and Plautius needed the emperor's help to complete the conquest; however, as Claudius was no military man and in the end spent only sixteen days in Britain, it is likely the Britons were already as good as beaten. Leadership passed to Caratacus, who took the fight outside Roman-controlled territory and remained at large until 51. ==Togodumnus and Togidubnus== Tacitus mentions a king who ruled several territories as a loyal ally of Rome into the later part of the first century,Tacitus, Agricola 14 called Cogidumnus in most manuscripts but Togidumnus in one.Charles E Murgia (1977) \\"The Minor works of Tacitus : a study in textual criticism\\", Classical Philology 72, p.339 A damaged inscription, naming him \\"..gidubnus\\", places him in Chichester.J. E. Bogaers (1979) \\"King Cogidubnus in Chichester: another reading of RIB 91\\", Britannia 10, pp. 243-254 The similarity of name has led some, including Barry Cunliffe of Oxford University,Barry Cunliffe (1999), Fisbourne Roman Palace, Tempus to suggest that they may be one and the same. John Hind argues that Dio was mistaken to write that Togodumnus died after the battle on the Thames: that the Greek word œÜŒ∏Œ±œÅŒµŒΩœÑ·Ω∏œÇ, \\"perished\\", may be Dio's mistranslation of a more ambiguous Latin word, amisso, \\"lost\\", in one of his hypothetical sources, that in fact Togodumnus was defeated rather than killed, and that the Britons wanted to avenge his defeat rather than his death. He goes on to propose that Togodumnus, having submitted to the Romans, was appointed by them as a friendly king over the territories of the Regini, the Atrebates, the Belgae and the Dobunni, becoming the loyal king referred to by Tacitus.J. G. F. Hind, \\"A.

Created by Otto Binder and Al Plastino, the character debuted in Action Comics #242 in July 1958. He is usually depicted as an extraterrestrial android who serves as one of Superman's greatest enemies and a frequent adversary of the Justice League. Brainiac is known for shrinking and stealing Kandor, the capital city of Superman's home planet Krypton, and is even responsible for Krypton's destruction in some continuities. The character's name is a portmanteau of the words brain and maniac. In 2009, Brainiac was ranked by IGN as the 17th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time. He has been substantially adapted into various forms of media, having been voiced by Corey Burton in various television shows set within the DC animated universe, by John Noble in animated film Superman: Unbound, and by Jeffrey Combs in the video game Injustice 2. In live-action television, Brainiac has been portrayed by James Marsters on Smallville and by Blake Ritson on Krypton. ==Fictional character biographySilver Age=== Brainiac's first appearance in Action Comics #242 (July 1958); art by Curt Swan and Stan Kaye The first Brainiac/Kandor comic book story in Action Comics #242 (July 1958) was based on a story arc in the Superman comic strip from April through August 1958. In the comic strip story, Superman's foe was named Romado, who traveled the cosmos with an alien white monkey named Koko, shrinking major cities and keeping them in glass jars. The strip's Kryptonian bottled city was named Dur- El-Va. This cross-continuity conflict was not unprecedented; in 1958 and '59, editor Mort Weisinger used the comic strip to prototype a number of concepts that he planned to introduce in the book, including Bizarro and red Kryptonite. Brainiac is a bald, green-skinned humanoid who arrives on Earth and shrinks various cities, including Metropolis, storing them in bottles with the intent of using them to restore the then-unnamed planet he ruled. He was originally notable only for having shrunk the bottle city of Kandor with his shrinking ray and for using a force field. In his initial story, he also traveled with an alien monkey named Koko; the monkey also appears in a 1960 Superman story retelling the story of Kandor's disappearance (Superman #141, Nov 1960). Koko was quickly dropped from Brainiac's stories but a version of the monkey has made sporadic appearances as the villain's pet in the series Justice and the 2008 storyline \\"Brainiac\\" in Action Comics. The villain's descendant Brainiac 5 also had a pet named Koko for several stories in the 1990s. In subsequent appearances in this early period, Brainiac was used mostly as a plot device rather than as a featured villain of the month. Brainiac's next appearance was mostly behind the scenes, when he tried to kill Lois Lane and Lana Lang, prompting Superman to give Lois and Lana superpowers. But the villain remained unseen except as a plot twist at the end of the story. Brainiac's next appearance was in \\"Superman's Return to Krypton\\" in Superman #141 (November 1960), in which the villain stole the bottle city of Kandor, the only city on Krypton that believes Jor-El's warning of doom for the planet, and which had already built a space ark within the city to save the population. Brainiac's next present-day appearance was in Action Comics #275 (April 1961), which showed the villain planning to defeat Superman by exposing him to both red and green kryptonite, giving Superman a third eye on the back of his head, forcing him to wear various hats to hide it. Superman soon defeated Brainiac and sent him off into the distant past. This was the first in-story appearance of Brainiac's iconic red diode/electrode-like objects atop his head, which had previously appeared on the cover of his first appearance in Action Comics #242 (July 1958), but were not shown in the actual story. In \\"Superboy\\" #106 (July 1963), an infant Superman meets Brainiac, and it is explained that Brainiac looks the same due to his 200-year life span. In superman issue #93, Brainiac regenerates himself. It is revealed that he came from a planet called Bryak and, after a voyage in space, he returned to find everybody dead from a plague. He intended to get people from other planets (in shrunken cities to be enlarged with his growth ray) to repopulate Bryak, where he would rule them. Brainiac's legacy was revealed in Action Comics #276 (May 1961), in a Legion of Super-Heroes back-up story. This story introduced a green-skinned, blond-haired teenager named Querl Dox (Brainiac 5), who claimed to be Brainiac's 30th-century descendant. Unlike his ancestor, Brainiac 5 used his \\"twelfth-level intellect\\" for the forces of good and joined the Legion alongside Supergirl, with whom he fell in love. His home planet was given variously as Bryak, Yod or Colu. In Superman #167 (February 1964), it was retconned that Brainiac was a robotic entity created by the Computer Tyrants of Colu to spy on and invade other worlds. Brainiac's distinctive gridwork of red diodes on his head are explained as \\"electric terminals of his sensory 'nerves'\\" necessary for him to function. To explain the 1961 introduction of the villain's living descendant Brainiac 5, the story reveals the Computer Tyrants provided the villain with an assistant, a young Coluan boy named Vril Dox tasked with masquerading as his \\"son\\" so others would believe Brainiac to be a trustworthy organic alien scientist with a family rather than a deadly robot. The young boy Vril Dox was designated \\"Brainiac 2\\". In the same issue, the letter column contained a \\"special announcement\\" explaining that the change in the characterization of Brainiac was \\"in deference\\" to the \\"Brainiac Computer Kit\\", a toy computer created by Edmund Berkeley (and based on the Geniac) that predated the creation of the comic book character. In this same story, Luthor discovers the Computer Tyrants could have given their robot villain a twelfth-level intellect but only gave him a tenth-level, the same as them, so he would not dominate them. Luthor frees Brainiac from imprisonment and increases his intelligence to a twelfth-level. He also implants a device to temporarily disable him or destroy him if necessary. The two join forces, but Brainiac later removes the device and blocks out Luthor's memory of his inner workings and the fact that he is a machine. This story becomes the first of many Brainiac/Luthor team-ups. Meanwhile, Vril Dox leads a revolt against the Computer Tyrants, eventually destroying them and freeing Colu. Brainiac sees a monument to this when he returns to Colu later on. 30th century (Pre-Crisis) At some indeterminate point in time, Brainiac fled into the 30th century. Developing the ability to absorb and manipulate massive amounts of stellar energy, he remade himself as \\"Pulsar Stargrave\\".As revealed in Superboy and the Legion of Super-Heroes #226-227 (April‚ÄìMay 1977) He became a powerful enemy of the Legion of Super-Heroes, and once masqueraded as Brainiac 5's biological father.Superboy and the Legion of Super-Heroes #224, #226 (February/April 1977) In current continuity, Brainiac's connection to Pulsar Stargrave remains an open question, one even Brainiac 5 has yet to resolve.Adventure Comics (vol. 2) #9 (late May 2010) ===Bronze Age=== Brainiac's robotic incarnation in Action Comics #544; art by Ed Hannigan After being revealed to be a robotic being, some Brainiac stories would end with the villain seemingly destroyed only for him to appear again in a repaired body or having transmitted his consciousness into a new robotic form. Since he was essentially a living computer program that could be housed in different forms if \\"killed,\\" Brainiac was sometimes referred to on comic book covers as \\"the villain who won't die!\\" In the 1980s, DC Comics attempted to re-define several aspects of Superman's stories to boost sagging sales. In Action Comics #544-546 (June‚ÄìAugust 1983), Lex Luthor acquires a renewed sense of purpose and dons high-tech \\"warsuit,\\" while Brainiac is reimagined by writer Marv Wolfman and artist Gil Kane and given a new appearance designed by Ed Hannigan. In a previous story, Brainiac had constructed a giant, computer- controlled planet to destroy Superman only to then be defeated by the hero and then trapped in the planet's core. In Wolfman and Kane's story \\"Rebirth\\", published in Action Comics #544, Brainiac attempts to free himself by causing the nearby star to go nova and utilize its energy. Instead, his body is converted into energy; his living program, his consciousness, experiences a strange journey before returning to his technology where a new body is created for him over the next few months. As Brainiac recollects, during his journey he saw a great hand reach out from a void, ensnaring him briefly before releasing him. He also remembers seeing Superman's face at the same time. Reborn in a new body, the villain believes he has seen the Master Programmer, the divine force behind the universe's creation, and that this entity created Superman as an \\"angel of death\\" to destroy Brainiac. More determined than ever to kill and study Superman, Brainiac now has a colder, more merciless, and robot-like personality than before (he claims he is without emotions yet shows signs of hatred and fear in regards to Superman). His new body is overtly robotic with a skull-like face and a reflective, iridescent honeycomb- patterned \\"braincase.\\" He also creates a starship shaped like his new skull and adorned by metal tendrils, often referred to by fans and comic creators as the \\"skull ship.\\" The ship acts as an extension Brainiac himself. Brainiac retains this robotic appearance until after the Crisis on Infinite Earths miniseries ends in 1986, rebooting DC Comics continuity. This incarnation of Brainiac meets his final end in the \\"Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?\\" storyline that ended the Pre-Crisis Silver/Bronze Age Superman chronology. Lex Luthor finds Brainiac's robotic head unit, barely with any power left. He hopes to team-up with the evil living program again, only to become an unwilling host body for Brainiac instead. Fighting Brainiac's control, Luthor begs a superpowered Lana Lang to kill him, who complies by breaking his neck. Luthor dies and Brainiac retains control of the body for a short time until rigor mortis sets in. \\"Propelled by sheer malice\\", Brainiac's head unit crawls a few inches before finally running out of power. ===Modern Age=== In the Post-Crisis DC Universe, Brainiac's history was completely rewritten. The Post-Crisis version of Brainiac was now a radical Coluan scientist called Vril Dox who, having attempted to overthrow the Computer Tyrants of Colu, was sentenced to death. In his last moments before disintegration, his consciousness was attracted light years away to Milton Moses Fine, a human sideshow mentalist who worked under the alias \\"The Amazing Brainiac\\". Needing cranial fluid to maintain his possession of Fine, Dox went on a murder spree. He discovered that Fine had genuine psychic powers and was thus a metahuman, which he frequently wielded against Superman.Adventures of Superman #438 (March 1988) \\"Panic in the Sky\\" In 1990, Brainiac is able to take over the minds of several LexCorp staffers. He makes the scientists create a new version of the skull ship (saying he thought of the design \\"in a dream\\") and use advanced genetic science to grow a new body for himself, resembling Milton Fine's form but taller, more physically fit, and with the green skin of a Coluan. He also has a new braincase helmet that resembles his Silver Age diodes. Now free of Fine's body and consciousness completely but still possessing the man's metahuman telepathic powers, Brainiac confronted Superman and then left Earth to plan another attack. Brainiac returned in the \\"Panic in the Sky\\" storyline after seizing control of the mobile planetary fortress Warworld and recruiting assistance from Maxima and the alien warrior Draaga. Discovering a lost and confused Matrix (an artificial life form who at this time operates as Supergirl), Brainiac brainwashes her into becoming his soldier. He clashes with the New Gods and then launches a pre-emptive strike on Earth.Action Comics #674 (February 1992). Superman: The Man of Steel #9 (March 1992). Superman (vol. 2) #65 (March 1992) Rather than wait for an invasion, Superman gathers a large group of superheroes and allies, one team attacking Warworld directly while the other remains on Earth to counter further attacks.Adventures of Superman #488 (March 1992)Superman: The Man of Steel #10 (April 1992) Through duplicates of his braincase, Brainiac briefly takes control of some of Earth's heroes, but ultimately he fails. Supergirl and the other heroes are freed from mental control and the villain is rendered catatonic.Action Comics #675 (March 1992). Superman (vol. 2) #66 (April 1992) His vegetative body is taken back to New Genesis for observation.Adventures of Superman #489 (April 1992) \\"Dead Again\\" A year after the seeming death and then return of Superman, a dead body matching the Kryptonian's appearance is found in his abandoned tomb, leading some to wonder if the hero's return was a deception.Superman the Man of Steel #38 (November 1994) It is revealed that Brainiac is no longer on New Genesis but revived and returned to Earth, leaving behind an illusion that he remained in a coma. While hidden, he created more delusions to turn the public against Superman and make the hero question his own sanity.Action Comics #705 (December 1994). Superman the Man of Steel #40 (January 1995) The two battle and Superman taunts the villain by insisting he is just Milton Moses Fine, a cheap entertainer. Fine's personality seemingly emerges and shuts down the Brainiac persona. Fine was then escorted off to a psychiatric facility.Superman (vol. 2) #96 (January 1995) The Doomsday Wars During a later skirmish with Superman, Fine's body is irreparably damaged, leaving Brainiac with only a short time to live. With help from a new Coluan assistant named Prin Vnok, Brainiac retrieves Doomsday, the monster that seemingly killed Superman before, and uses him as a new host body. Now a cunning psychic with a super-strong, near-indestructible body, Brainiac attacks the Justice League. But Doomsday's own raging mind fights back and Brainiac realizes he still needs a suitable host. Hoping to create a clone Doomsday form by manipulating human DNA, Brainiac attempts to steal a prematurely born baby Superman is transporting to a Neo-Natal Intensive Care Unit, the newborn child of Pete Ross and Lana Lang. Brainiac sees this as an opportunity for revenge, correctly concluding that Ross and Lang are close to him. Using a 'psi- blocker' device, Superman thwarts Brianiac's plans and the villain is forced to house his consciousness within a completely robotic body. Dubbing his new form Brainiac 2.5, the villain fears he is now trapped in this form.Superman: The Doomsday Wars #1-3 (1998) Brainiac 13 Brainiac 13. Art by Ed McGuinness, Steve Kim, and Tommy Yune. At the turn of the millennium, Brainiac 2.5 revealed that he had placed a sleeper virus in LexCorp's Y2K bug safeguards. This virus was intended to dramatically boost his abilities. However, the virus instead allowed his upgraded future self, Brainiac 13 (or \\"B-13\\"), to travel from the 64th century to the present day and take control of Brainiac 2.5's body. Brainiac 13 then began transforming Metropolis into the 64th-century version of the city, which he controlled, and also began upgrading Metallo into a giant-sized version of himself. Brainiac 13 then took control of several android superheroes, such as the Red Tornado and Hourman, and used them against Superman. The Metal Men's responsometers were able to protect them from his programming, and allowed them to help defeat Metallo. During a fight with the Eradicator (who was attempting to 'hijack' the B13 virus and use it for its own ends), Superman discovered that Brainiac 13 could not cope with Kryptonian technology, due to incompatibility issues. This gave Superman a plan to stop Brainiac 13's scheme. With the aid of the rebuilt Kelex, Superman tricked Luthor into connecting a Kryptonian battlesuit to one of Brainiac 13's power conduits. Kelex then reactivated the Red Tornado to help Superman break Brainiac 13 down into his respective nanobots and trap him in the suit. Brainiac 13 was able to work with Brainiac 2.5‚Äînow transferred into the aged body of Lena Luthor‚Äîand prepared a tactic against Imperiex for the upcoming Imperiex War. The Brainiacs successfully engineered Imperiex's defeat, allowing Brainiac 13 to absorb Imperiex's power and use it to overpower the combined heroes and villains of the universe while simultaneously devastating both Earth and Apokolips. Brainiac 13 planned to use the power he stole from Imperiex to conquer the universe and reshape it in his image, and is made so powerful by the absorption that none of the heroes, not even Superman, can hope to damage him.Superman the Man of Steel #117 (October 2001). However, with help from Lex's temporal displacement technology and Darkseid's Boom Tube technology boosted by magic supplied by Tempest and the Amazons, Superman was able to destroy Brainiac 13 and Imperiex by sending them through a temporal Boom tube where they were annihilated in the Big Bang. Brainiac 13 had his body disintegrated and the remnants of his mind scattered across sixty trillion light years, finally killing the chronologically last known version of Brainiac.Action Comics #782 (October 2001). After the death of Brainiac 13, Superman discovered that the version of Krypton he previously visited via the Phantom Zone was, in fact, a trap created by Brainiac 13. Having been defeated by Kryptonian technology, Brainiac 13 had traveled back in time to the real Krypton prior to its destruction. There, he stole the Eradicator matrix and Jor-El's diaries, and created a false Krypton based on Jor-El's favorite period in history. Sometime later, Superman traveled into the future and battled Brainiac 12. He learned that everything Brainiac 13 did in the past was designed to ensure things reached the point where Brainiac 13 would be created. Brainiac 12's defeat before his upgrade apparently reversed the advances Brainiac 13 had made to Metropolis.Superman (vol. 2) #200 (February 2004) The Insiders Brainiac with his descendant Brainiac 8, as they discuss his use of organics; art by Matthew Clark Around the time of the Graduation Day event, a future version of Brainiac, called Brainiac 6, used his \\"granddaughter\\", Brainiac 8 (also known as Indigo), to kill Donna Troy in order to ensure the fate of Colu. Indigo then infiltrated the Outsiders until she attacked the team, along with Brainiac 6 and his allies, Lex Luthor, and a brainwashed Superboy, who had attacked the Teen Titans. In the ensuing battle, Indigo died and Superboy broke away from the brainwashing, while Luthor escaped. While his ship was destroyed, Brainiac's condition and whereabouts after the battle are unknown.Outsiders (vol. 3) #24-25 (July- August 2005)Teen Titans (vol. 3) #24-25 (July - August 2005) Silver Age Brainiac in the Post-Crisis universe Later stories revealed that elements of Brainiac's Pre-Crisis history occurred in the Post-Crisis character's history prior to his possession of Milton Moses Fine and his first encounter with Superman. The citizens of Kandor recall that Brainiac stole their city from Krypton, and not the alien wizard Tolos. History of the DC Universe mentions his defeat by the Omega Men, although this is not seen in Crisis on Infinite Earths itself, and noted a second Brainiac was created in a laboratory on Earth two years later. In the Silver Age: JLA one-shot, the Injustice League discovered numerous shrunken alien cities found in Brainiac's abandoned spaceship. Brainiac's updated mechanical form Brainiac battles Superman during the Infinite Crisis event. Cover of Superman (vol. 2) #219 (September 2005). Art by Ed Benes. Brainiac later reappeared as a swarm of interlinked nanotechnological units. Its operation was to sabotage a Waynetech research facility accomplished by infecting Metallo with a computer virus and controlling him from orbit. Superman and Batman tracked Brainiac's signal to an orbital facility and attacked. Brainiac's nanoswarm body was destroyed, though he had infected the Metal Men during their previous encounter with Metallo. Brainiac proceeded to use them to acquire a prototype OMAC unit, which Bruce Wayne had developed through the use of Brainiac 13 nanotechnology. Superman and Batman destroyed the OMAC body with the aid of the Metal Men, after the Metal Men overcame Brainiac's control.Superman/Batman #34-36 (May‚ÄìAugust 2007) Return Following revisions to Superman's continuity in Infinite Crisis and Action Comics #850, Brainiac reappeared in a self-titled five-part story arc in Action Comics. In Action Comics #866 (August 2008), a Brainiac robot probe (resembling his skeleton-esque Pre- Crisis incarnation, and mistaken for the real Brainiac by Clark) arrives on Earth and battles Superman. After the probe is defeated, information about Superman's blood is sent to the original Brainiac. As Brainiac wakes up, his computer announces \\"Attempt #242 in progress\\", a reference to Brainiac's first appearance in Action Comics #242, and to the many encounters between Brainiac and Superman. In the following issue, Supergirl reveals to Superman that Brainiac shrunk the Kryptonian city of Kandor and placed it in a bottle, and that all previous incarnations of Brainiac that Superman has encountered were just probes, clones, and nanite-controlled bodies. She notes that no one has ever actually seen Brainiac. Inspired by Supergirl's story, Superman attempts to find Brainiac and stop him. He heads to a world under attack by Brainiac just in time to be caught in a supernova as Brainiac destroys the system's star and the populated world along with. The supernova knocks Superman out, and he is caught and brought onto Brainiac's ship. Superman escapes from his imprisonment and sees Brainiac emerging from his \\"bio-shell\\". This version of Brainiac resembles a much larger and more muscular version of the original, Pre-Crisis Brainiac, and has motives similar to the Superman: The Animated Series incarnation of the character in that he travels the universe and steals the knowledge of various alien cultures, abducting and shrinking cities from each planet as samples, and then destroys the planet so that the value of the destroyed civilization's knowledge is increased. Superman attacks Brainiac, but Brainiac manages to overpower the Man of Steel before restraining him with the help of his ship's internal systems. Brainiac inserts the subdued Superman into a machine that allows him to read the Kryptonian's mind, with the intent of assimilating his brain. Brainiac's ship then travels to Earth and prepares to abduct the city of Metropolis. Brainiac successfully steals Metropolis, and prepares to fire a missile that will destroy the Sun and the Earth itself. Supergirl ends up captured along with the rest of Metropolis, but Superman breaks out of his restraints again and frees her. Supergirl stops the missile, while Superman battles Brainiac. Brainiac appears to have the advantage in physical combat yet again, but Superman knocks Brainiac out of his ship and into a swamp, where Brainiac is overwhelmed by the microscopic organisms covering his body. Superman uses this distraction to defeat Brainiac. While Superman frees the cities of Metropolis and Kandor, the villain launches a missile to the Kent farm in an act of spite. The farm is destroyed, and Jonathan Kent suffers a fatal heart attack because of it.Action Comics #866-870 (June‚ÄìOctober 2008) Brainiac is brought to a top-secret military base, where the imprisoned Lex Luthor is assigned to discover his secrets. Luthor eventually manages to use Brainiac's connection to his ship to kill the soldiers assigned to watch him. Brainiac manages to free himself from Luthor's control, forcing him on board the ship, and the two make their escape.Adventure Comics (vol. 2) #0 (April 2009) Notably, upon learning of Brainiac's modus operandi of destroying planets by destabilizing nearby stars when he is done collecting cities and knowledge from said planets, Superman openly speculates that Brainiac destroyed Krypton, which was destroyed when its sun went nova soon after Brainiac abducted Kandor and Argo. He also asks the alien what he did to Krypton's sun.Action Comics #868 (October 2008). Brainiac ignores the query, neither confirming or denying his responsibility, though he does heavily imply it (\\"In fifty-seven minutes, my solar aggressor will reach your sun. It will flare up, and the Earth will be incinerated. Just like Krypton.\\"). Superman still believes Brainiac had a part in Krypton's destruction after the end of this story arc.Superman Secret Files and Origins 2009 New Krypton Following this, Brainiac, now in possession of his ship again, unleashes his robot army against the newly created planet of New Krypton, and the Kryptonian citizens rise up to fight the drones. General Zod's army proves totally unable to fend them off, as the Brainiac's ship's force fields are seemingly invulnerable and his drones are equipped with red sunray guns, allowing them to kill tens of thousands of Kryptonians. Superman, being the only one who knows how to penetrate his force fields (having learned the trick in the previous story arc), manages to enter Brainiac's ship. Supergirl leads the Kryptonians against the drones, but is attacked by an anti-Kryptonian Brainiac probe. Superboy, Mon-El, and the Legion of Super- Heroes join the fight and save Supergirl. After this, Brainiac shrinks Kandor again and re-bottles it, including a miniature red sun to de-power all the Kryptonians inside. The Legion, Supergirl, Superboy, Zod, and Superman all make it on to Brainiac's ship, thanks to Brainiac 5 hacking his ancestor's force fields and allowing them entry. The Legion explains to Zod that, just as Krypton's city of Kandor is held in a bottle onboard Brainiac's ship, other planets' cities are also imprisoned, and, therefore, Zod cannot destroy Brainiac's ship until the cities can be rescued. Zod sends Supergirl off and then arrests the Legionnaires, branding them terrorists. Meanwhile, Superman is about to face off against Brainiac when he is knocked down by a kryptonite energy blast fired by Lex Luthor and subsequently captured. Brainiac locks him in captivity with the intent to experiment on him, but Superman escapes and meets up with the rest of the superheroes and Zod on a separate section of the ship. Zod enters the scene and engages Brainiac in combat while Supergirl, Superboy, and the Legion recover the bottled cities on Brainiac's ship, including Kandor. Zod seems to be losing his fight with Brainiac, when suddenly Superman gets up and tackles Brainiac from behind. Before the battle between the two Kryptonians and the villain can continue, Brainiac's ship starts to destabilize and descend towards the planet. It is revealed that Lex Luthor sabotaged the ship and re-sized one of the cities while inside. Luthor's intervention causes the ship to crash into New Krypton, destroying it while Supergirl and the Legion re-size Kandor. However, the city that Luthor expanded is still growing, now putting Kandor at risk. As Brainiac 5 works on the problem, Supergirl is shocked to discover Superman impaled by pieces of Brainiac's ship as a result of the explosion. Superman appears to have been fatally stricken. Luthor, though reeling from the explosion, is pleased with all the destruction he has caused. Brainiac confronts Luthor in the ruins of the ship and is furious that Lex sabotaged his ship. Luthor mocks him and spits in his eye before Brainiac angrily snaps Luthor's neck, killing him. Now deprived of his ship and technology, and seemingly depowered by his ship's destruction, Brainiac finds himself faced by an entire city of angry, solar- powered Kryptonians. Zod is eager for a final showdown with Brainiac, who calls Zod a coward for confronting Brainiac with his powers intact and an army of super-powered Kryptonians at his back. In response, Zod fires the red sun radiation from an Archer rifle at himself, to remove his powers and thus supposedly level the playing field as he prepares to take Brainiac down. Brainiac 5 gives Superman a transfusion of Conner's blood and exposes him to a very large dose of concentrated synthesized yellow sun rays. Using these techniques, Brainiac 5 is able to revive Superman. Despite the loss of his powers, Zod is able to get the upper hand on the similarly powerless Brainiac and force him to his knees. Zod is about to shoot Brainiac when Superman intervenes. This causes a heated argument between Superman and Zod. Zod commands his soldiers to restrain Kal-El so Zod can proceed with the execution of Brainiac. Brainiac 5, sensing that this is his moment of destiny, steps in and teleports himself and Brainiac off of New Krypton. It is revealed that Lex used a Luthor robot, supplied by the Toyman, to accomplish his mission on New Krypton, and that Brainiac killed the robot instead. Lex is very much alive and discussing with General Lane how his objective, to bring chaos to New Krypton, was achieved. Lex has been working as an agent of General Lane all along. The disarray that Lex caused provides Lane with a window of opportunity as he prepares for the impending war with New Krypton. Lex receives a Presidential pardon for his efforts. The story ends with Zod rallying his people as he declares war on the planet Earth. The story concludes in the next miniseries, Superman: War of the Supermen. Mon-El plants the many bottled cities that Brainiac has captured over the years on various planets across the galaxy. These cities will one day become the United Planets by the 31st century, the same planets that will produce the members of the Legion of Super-Heroes. Brainiac 5 takes Brainiac to their homeworld of Colu where he hands him over to Vril Dox II, a.k.a. Brainiac 2. Vril Dox happily turns his \\"father\\" over to his people for his crimes. However Lyrl Dox, a.k.a. Brainiac 3, releases his \\"grandfather\\" with a weapon called Pulsar Stargrave. What then occurs is an all-out battle for Colu between all three present-day Brainiacs. Vril Dox even calls in Lobo for help. Brainac breaks out of his prison and, after causing much damage on Colu, escapes with Pulsar Stargrave in tow for parts unknown.R.E.B.E.L.S. (vol. 2) #15-20 (May‚ÄìSeptember 2010) The New 52 Brainiac's origin in The New 52 is revealed in Superman #23.2. Vril Dox was acknowledged as the greatest scientist on his homeworld, Yod-Colu, given his advances in force field technology and miniaturization. He developed an artificial intelligence, C.O.M.P.U.T.O., allowing him to discover the fifth dimension. Dox discovered the fifth dimension was in a state of war, and a group of its inhabitants, the Multitude, had entered their dimension and destroyed over a hundred planets. Realizing Yod-Colu was next in the Multitude's path, Dox tried to find a way to save his planet, even performing experiments on his son. The magistrates of Yod-Colu sentenced Dox to exile, but Dox used C.O.M.P.U.T.O. to take control of Yod-Colu's computer networks. Copying the planet's database, Dox constructed an army of robot servants called Terminauts and miniaturized the city his wife and son lived on and bottled it in a force field, while the rest of Yod-Colu was destroyed by the Multitude. After the destruction of Yod-Colu, Dox constructed an army of starships and distributed his consciousness across a series of robots that would each travel the universe in order to preserve planets from the Multitude, becoming known as the Collector of Worlds. One of these robots attacked Krypton. Dox became fascinated by Jor-El, a Kryptonian scientist who actually saved his homeworld from the Multitude. Upon returning to Krypton, however, Brainiac discovered Krypton had been destroyed.Superman (vol. 3) #23.2 (September 2013) Referred to at first as 'The Collector of Worlds', Brainiac is first seen as the mysterious informant that supplies Lex Luthor information of Superman and his alien nature.Action Comics (vol. 2) #2 (October 2011) Clark is having a dream of Krypton's final moments in which an artificial intelligence that controls the planet wakes up robots in an attempt to preserve the Kryptonian culture. Later, while Clark conducts an interview in a robotic factory, the same harvester robots appear. John Corben (the soon- to-be supervillain Metallo) is suddenly possessed by the artificial intelligence. It demands Superman.Action Comics (vol. 2) #3 (November 2011) The robots create havoc throughout Metropolis, but Superman soon realizes that they are really after him. Superman fights the possessed Corben with the help of John Henry Irons. Although they managed to defeat him, the alien sentience had already miniaturized and bottled the city of Metropolis and took it to his ship in space.Action Comics (vol. 2) #4 (December 2011) Superman travels to the ship to find many alien bottled cities, Kandor included. The alien identifies himself as a being from the planet Colu where he was known as C.O.M.P.U.T.O and on Krypton he was called Brainiac 1.0. He claims that, without Superman and the ship that brought him to Earth, his Kryptonian collection is incomplete. The alien intelligence demands Superman make a choice: the intelligence will disable life support in both the Kandor and Metropolis bottles, and Superman must choose which city to save using indestructible Kryptonian armor found on the ship. Superman decides on neither and wears the armor (which changes instantly into the current Superman costume design). Brainiac sends Metallo to attack Superman, but due to Superman reasoning with him over his feelings for Lois Lane, he breaks free of Brainiac's control and joins Superman in his attack. Superman then uses his rocket from Krypton that had also been miniaturized with Metropolis to attack Brainiac's mind, which the rocket was able to do since its primary mission was to protect Kal-El. In doing so, Metropolis was returned to Earth and Superman took possession of Brainiac's ship and made it his new super citadel.Action Comics (vol. 2) #8 (April 2012) Notably, the ship Clark was placed into as a child was described as having \\"Brainiac AI\\", leaving the identity of the Collector of Worlds in doubt.Action Comics (vol. 2) #5 (January 2012) The Colony of the Collector of Worlds told Superman that its AI technology went by different names, beginning on Yod-Colu as C.O.M.P.U.T.O. On Noma, he was called Pneumenoid; on Bryak it was Mind2; on Krypton he was called Brainiac 1.0; and, finally on Earth, he is the Internet.Action Comics (vol. 2) #7 (March 2012) After this defeat, Brainiac retreated to deeper parts of the cosmos, and eventually came across the planet Tolerance, the setting of a bounty hunting glimmernet game show called The Hunted. Striking a deal with Lady Styx, overlord of the Tenebrian Dominion, he bottles a portion of the Sh'diki Borough of Tolerance to add to his collection. He encounters Jediah Caul, a former member of the Green Lantern Corps, who combats and infects Brainiac's ship. Ultimately, Brainiac abandons his plans with the Sh'diki Borough and ejects Caul and the bottled city before leaving for parts unknown.Threshold #5-6 (July‚ÄìAugust 2013) Convergence Back on Earth, during an investigation of 20 kidnapped people who developed metahuman powers after being kidnapped by Brainiac, one of these 20 infects Lois Lane, thereby giving Brainiac control over a close ally of Superman.Action Comics Annual (vol. 2) #2 (August 2013) Brainiac plots his return to Earth, using Lane to infiltrate Earth's defense systems to allow an easier path for his physical return.Superman/Wonder Woman #8 (July 2014) and even upgrading her body to contain his 12th level intelligence. His minion Cyborg-Superman (a reconstructed Zor-El, father of Supergirl)Supergirl (vol. 6) #21 (August 2013) constructs a portal to allow Brainiac's command ship and \\"daughter ships\\" to travel to Earth from throughout the galaxy.Superman/Wonder Woman Annual #1 (September 2014) Superman, whom Brainiac had conspired to 'infect' with the monster Doomsday in order to drive him away from Earth, uses his augmented power to attack Brainiac's gigantic mothership and break through to its core and, finally, Vril Dox himself. The Coluan appears still-humanoid, and explains his reasoning for stealing minds from throughout the universe: he has concluded that if he can 'unite' the minds of a certain critical number of people, he will be able to change reality itself. His motivation for this appears a desire to right the wrongs he feels responsible for: the loss of his wife and child back on Colu. His plan is undone when Superman drags him, mothership and all, into a black hole. But then, Vril Dox is snatched away to safety, it seems, by a being who appears to be the true Brainiac: an immensely powerful entity from outside the universe itself.Superman: Doomed This version of Brainiac, a composite of Brainiac from around the Multiverse, is revealed to be the pre-Flashpoint era Brainiac who, having found his way into the Source Wall and into the Multiverse, was thrown back in the timestream and mutated by the effects of \\"crisis\\" events such as Crisis on Infinite Earths, Zero Hour, and 52, creating a godlike being.Convergence #0 He then uncovered the location of Vanishing Point from nearly killing New 52 Earth-0's Michelle Carter, from which he could roam the complete history of the Multiverse, collecting doomed cities from defunct timelines, alternative futures, and parallel worlds to add to his collection, in Convergence, leaving behind an agent, Telos, to rule a planet of the same name containing the cities. Brainiac's attempt to do this to a future timeline of Earth-0 was narrowly averted by the heroes in the story The New 52: Futures End; Brainiac was contained in a T-sphere, leaving Telos stranded without his master, prompting the events of Convergence in which the planets are bid to fight each other. When the events of Convergence nearly end in an irreversible destruction of the Multiverse, the time traveller Waverider, formerly the pre-Flashpoint Booster Gold, frees Brainiac, who reveals he is sick from his mutations and only wishes to return to normal, to being Brainiac of Colu. He sends most of the heroes home, and with help from the Zero Hour Parallax and the pre- Flashpoint Superman, averts the collapse of the Multiverse from Crisis on Infinite Earths, and is returned to the normal Brainiac. His actions also allow various parallel universes and alternate timelines to exist as the new Multiverse.Convergence #1-8 Green Lantern Corps Brainiac's name is first referenced in an issue of Hal Jordan and the Green Lantern Corps. The entirety of the Green and Yellow Lanterns (including Hal Jordan, Guy Gardner, and John Stewart), along with Starro the Conqueror, are lured into a trap and subsequently hit with a shrink ray while on the planet Xudar, leaving them tiny and helpless. In the next issue, they are trapped in a bottle, and their jailer is revealed to be a robot claiming to run on \\"Brainiac 2.0\\" software. The robot heavily resembles both Brainiac's 1983 skeleton-esque incarnation and the robotic drones utilized by the post-2008 version of Brainiac. It has a collection of shrunken bottled planets, and travels in a ship resembling Brainiac's skullship. At the time it was not clear if this was the true Brainiac after Rebirth or yet another one of his drones.Hal Jordan and the Green Lantern Corps #8-9 (2016). The machine's victory is short-lived, however, as it is revealed that Larfleeze was able to reprogram it to his side using an Orange Lantern ring, having rebooted its life systems after finding it inactive on his homeworld with its ship. Larfleeze is impressed that the machine was able to capture the Green Lanterns and Starro, and even more impressed with the machine's shrinking technology, and plans to hijack its technology to put together his own collection. He takes the ship and collection to his homeworld of Okaara. However, upon being informed that the Yellow and Green Lanterns are still fighting inside the bottle and trying to kill each other, Larfleeze's own greed for having everything gets the best of him and he ends up breaking the container. This frees the Lanterns, and somehow restores them to their normal size and strength, after which they immediately start rampaging inside the ship and trashing Brainiac/Larfleeze's collection. Hal, Kyle, John and Guy go on to lead the attack on the Orange Lantern Corps. With everyone fighting together, the Orange Lantern Corps are quickly overwhelmed. Larfleeze accuses the robot of playing him; when it responds that it simply did what he programmed it to do, Larfleeze destroys it in a rage.Hal Jordan and the Green Lantern Corps #10-12 (2016). The Superman storyline \\"New World\\" later confirmed via a flashback cameo that the Post- Crisis, post-2008 version of Brainiac (the tall, muscular, green-skinned cybernetic alien scientist) still exists in the post-Rebirth continuity, and has encountered Superman in the past. Thus, the robot that defeated Starro, the Green Lantern Corps, and the Yellow Lantern Corps before subsequently being dispatched by Larfleeze was, in fact, one of his drones.Action Comics #978 (June 2017) No Justice Brainiac later arrived on Earth again and battled the Justice League, who proved no match for him and his ship, until Superman arrived. However, he did not come to destroy the Earth, but to deliver a warning: that there is a cosmic-level threat in the universe coming to Earth, one that the heroes of Earth are woefully ill-prepared for. Brainiac thinks he can defeat the threat, but it means teaming up with Superman and the Justice League and combining members of the League with some of the most dangerous supervillains in the DC Universe and sending them into battle against this extinction-level menace. Four teams outfitted with Brainiac's technology are formed (including among other members, Lex Luthor, Batman, Wonder Woman, and Sinestro), with Brainiac himself working directly alongside his nemesis, Superman.Scott Snyder Joins Forces With James Tynion IV and Joshua Williamson. The No Justice miniseries begins with the Omega Titans, the aforementioned threat, attacking Colu, Brainiac's homeworld, which explains Brainiac's kidnapping of Earth's superheroes and supervillains. Brainiac claims to have developed a plan to defeat the Omega Titans and the superheroes only need to follow his orders to win, but Amanda Waller uses the hidden Protocol XI, which involves kidnapping the world's most dangerous psychics, to probe Brainiac's mind and find out what he knows. The strain of the psychic attack causes Brainiac's head to explode, apparently killing him. In Scott Snyder's Justice League run, in order to fill in the gap left by Black Manta and the Joker, Lex Luthor sets Professor Ivo to work reconstructing Brainiac, with the intention of him joining the Legion of Doom. Despite teaming up with them, Brainiac does have his own motivations, including planning his revenge against Waller. Brainiac 6 He is the gang version of Brainiac and first appears in Adventures of the Super Sons #1. ==Powers and abilities== Brainiac's most consistent power (endemic to all versions) is his \\"twelfth- level intellect\\", allowing calculation abilities, enhanced memory and advanced understanding of mechanical engineering, bio-engineering, physics, and other theoretical and applied sciences, as well as extensive knowledge of various alien technologies. For comparison, the population of 20th century Earth as a whole constitutes a sixth-level intelligence and the population of 31st century Earth as a whole is a ninth-level intelligence. His Post-Crisis incarnation claims that his brain can process and sort the knowledge of over four hundred ninety octodecillion beings (490 √ó 1057), which is an enormous number, about five billion times the estimated number of atoms of the Earth. The character has created devices such as a force field belt capable of withstanding Superman's most powerful blows,Action Comics #242 (July 1958) and a shrinking ray capable of reducing cities. Brainiac's advanced mental powers have shown him capable of possessing others, absorbing information from other beings, transferring his consciousness,Action Comics #544-546 (June‚ÄìAugust 1983) creating and manipulating computer systems, replicating multiple versions of himself, and exerting powers to traverse or control space and time. Among organic beings, Brainiac views only his frequent partner Lex Luthor as a peer intellect. Brainiac is usually depicted with an incredibly high degree of super strength and durability; the exact level varies, but usually hovers at around Superman's strength. Brainiac's exact abilities vary drastically throughout his various incarnations. ===Pre-Crisis=== Originally, Brainiac was a scientist with no superhuman abilities aside from his intellect. He fought Superman via the use of his advanced technology and cunning, similar to Lex Luthor. Among these were a forcefield belt which projected a shield that made him immune to all harm (even Superman's blows), a shrinking ray, and a headpiece consisting of a cluster of diode/electrode-like objects. His cybernetic headpiece lets him interface with technology and project energy blasts from his head, which were powerful enough to significantly harm Superman. Superman described the blasts as \\"blindingly painful... almost unbearable\\" and as a threat to his life.Superman #338 (August 1979) The Pre-Crisis Brainiac was referred to by an omniscient narrator as \\"the super-computer space pirate-- Superman's most powerful nemesis.\\"Action Comics #443 (January 1975) Brainiac being unpowered and reliant on external weaponry was largely still the case even when he was retconned as an android, but in the 1980s, this changed and he gained the abilities that would stick to all subsequent incarnations: superstrength and durability, technopathy, and super longevity. His technopathic abilities extend to control of his ship, with which he shares a symbiotic relationship. The android version of Brainiac was capable of downloading his consciousness to spare, robotic bodies in the event that his original was destroyed or damaged. He could also possess organic beings in certain circumstances, as he did to Luthor during Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?. The final body utilized by the Pre-Crisis Brainiac (resembling a robotic skeleton) was technopathic, had superstrength and durability, could discharge energy blasts capable of hurting Superman, and knew of how to \\"spin\\" the psychokinetic energies he generated into a web-like net which could hold Superman at bay. Among the knowledge he absorbed was extensive information on hand-to-hand combat techniques, making him a very skilled combatant. Despite this, he saw physical confrontation as beneath him, and preferred to defeat foes with his mind.Who's Who: The Definitive Directory of the DC Universe #3 ===Post- Crisis=== Probes John Byrne's re-imagining of the character possessed telepathy and telekinesis, as well as the ability to discharge energy blasts. He was an alien consciousness who had possessed the body of a powerful human psychic and awakened his powers, further augmenting them with an implanted electrode head-piece. His vast psychic powers allowed him to seriously challenge Superman, and defeat multiple members of the New Gods (including Orion) with a single psionic energy blast,Action Comics but the body's lack of Superman-level durability was a major liability and eventually led to it being rendered useless in a gasoline explosion. After this organic body was destroyed, Brainiac's consciousness built and possessed various robotic bodies and occasionally hijacked other organic bodies (such as Doomsday's). His abilities were dependent on the body he was inhabiting at the time, which could vary from as weak as a normal human to far stronger than Superman. His nanoswarm incarnation, for instance, could shapeshift, regenerate, project energy blasts and force fields, and match Superman blow for blow; Superman stated Brainiac to have physical strength on par with Doomsday's in this form.Superman/Batman #36 (August 2007). His strongest incarnation was Brainiac 13, who, even prior to absorbing Imperiex, was so physically formidable that Superman could not remotely affect, much less damage, him. By contrast, Brainiac was easily able to kill Superman, and would have done so in a short time had he not been devoted to torturing the Man of Steel.Action Comics #763 (March 2000) True form It was later revealed that this version of Brainiac (like the previous ones) was merely a mentally-controlled probe of the real Brainiac, who was a living Coluan that had genetically and cybernetically enhanced himself. The true Brainiac lacked psychic powers, but still possessed super physical attributes, intelligence, and technopathy. He possesses a level of strength vastly surpassing that of a full-powered Superman; capable of easily overpowering the Kryptonian in a grapple and flooring him with a single punch, breaking his near-invulnerable skin by squeezing Superman's head with his fingers,Action Comics #868 (October 2008) and catching one of Superman's punches and crushing his hand until it bled, forcing Superman to his knees.Action Comics #870 (December 2008) His durability is also far greater than Superman's, shown when he absorbs several consecutive blows to the face from the Man of Steel without visible harm and later claims that Superman's punches did not hurt him at all.Superman: Last Stand Of New Krypton #3 (April 2010). Even a concentrated and sustained burst of heat vision directly to Brainiac's eyes did not seriously debilitate him, though it inflicted noticeable damage. At one point Brainiac 5 warns that Superman would most likely die against Brainiac in a straight fight.Superman #699 (June 2010) Superman Secret Files and Origins 2009 further state that Brainiac is \\"as strong and invulnerable as a Kryptonian.\\"Superman: Secret Files and Origins 2009 (October 2009) Despite his enormous physical enhancements, Brainiac had several weaknesses. Like the Pre-Crisis Brainiac, he is mentally connected to his ship in such a way that he can be disabled for a short period if separated without warning. Initially, he had the weakness of being disabled by his mysophobia and sensory overload when dumped into Earth's atmosphere, though he does not seem to have this defect in his later battles on Earth, such as when he defeated Superboy,Adventure Comics (vol. 2) #6 (March 2010). suggesting that he had fixed it, or that he is only overloaded in particularly dirty environments. Finally, being separated from his ship for prolonged periods causes him to physically deteriorate and become far less powerful, as Lex Luthor observed while studying his unconscious body over the course of several days when it was in the custody of the U.S. government. This Brainiac is an incredibly powerful physical fighter, but like his Pre-Crisis counterpart is most dangerous due to the advanced technology he wields, much of it of his own invention. These include his classic shrinking ray and force fields, as well as other gadgets such as missiles capable of causing stars to go into a premature supernova state.Action Comics #867 (September 2008) His force fields are so impregnable that a direct hit from an energy weapon that kills several fully powered Kryptonians as collateral damage did not leave so much as a single scratch on his ship.Superman: Last Stand of New Krypton #1 (May 2010) Brainiac also possesses an army of at least tens of thousands of humanoid robotic \\"probes\\". These probes are strong enough to draw blood from SupermanAction Comics #866 (August 2008) and tough enough to survive some of his powerful blows. During the New Krypton story arc, Brainiac upgraded his probes with red-sun ray guns for the purpose of fighting Kryptonians. When Brainiac orders these drones to attack New Krypton, they quickly kill over eleven thousand solar-powered Kryptonians. He is a biological creature that has altered his body to acquire more knowledge to become \\"better\\". With his ship, his vast knowledge, and his powerful technology, Brainiac has captured thousands of cities and has assimilated and destroyed just as many civilizations, making him the worst mass murderer in the history of the Milky WayR.E.B.E.L.S. (vol. 2) #19 (August 2010) and one of the most feared beings in the known universe. He is considered one of the most powerful villains Superman has ever faced. ===The New 52=== Brainiac, in The New 52, seems to have kept most of the powers and equipment of his Post-Crisis incarnation (including his shrinking ray, force fields, and robot army), with notable additions. Brainiac's ship has been massively upgraded in this incarnation; it is now larger than the entire Earth & Moon planet system,Pak, Greg (w). Action Comics Annual vol. 2 #3 (August 2014), DC Comics and carries within it a massive invasion fleet of many types of smaller ships. He still appears to possess the physical strength and near-invulnerability of his Post-Crisis counterpart, as shown when he easily defeats the Cyborg Superman.Supergirl (vol. 6) #24 (December 2013). By the Superman: Doomed story arc, Brainiac has used his twelfth-level intellect to become an enormously powerful psychic and telepath, augmented by the minds that he has stolen and digitized from across the galaxy, and capable of taking control of all seven billion minds on Earth at the same time. He also demonstrates considerable reality-warping abilities; he claims that the combined psionic power of all the minds he has captured throughout the universe can allow him to change reality to his will, and plans to use this power to remake the universe in his image. However, this plan is prematurely ended when Superman battles him telepathically and crashes his ship into a black hole. Following the Doomed story arc, it is further revealed that the Pre-Crisis Brainiac somehow escaped the Crisis on Infinite Earths itself, and mutated from the various crises since, becoming a godly being. This version of Brainiac is nigh-omnipotent and omniscient, with the ability to warp universes and time travel. Using this newfound power he either recreated or interacted with all the different iterations of himself throughout the multiverse, using his New 52 incarnation as yet another one of his many probes. He has grown so much in power that now he can collect cities from other universes at will. At the end of the Convergence story arc, Brainiac recreates the DC Multiverse.(27 May 2015). \\"Decoding Convergence With Jeff King: The Finale\\". ComicBook.com. Retrieved 29 May 2015. ==Other versions== The character has been depicted in various out-of-continuity stories. In the Amalgam Comics line, which was a joint venture between DC and Marvel Comics, readers are introduced to Galactiac, a combination of Brainiac and Marvel Comics antagonist Galactus.Challengers of the Fantastic #1 (June 1997) Brainiac also appears in Superman: Red Son,Superman: Red Son #1-3 (June‚ÄìAugust 2003) JLA: Shogun of Steel,JLA: Shogun of Steel (2002) and the novel The Last Days of Krypton by author Kevin J. Anderson. ===Superman: Red Son=== In the Superman: Red Son graphic novel, Brainiac (here depicted as an alien AI) serves as the main antagonist. He first appears working with Luthor in 1978 to undermine Superman, eventually shrinking and bottling the city of Stalingrad. Superman defeats Brainiac soon after, but his inability to restore Stalingrad becomes his one failure and a recurring source of guilt. After his defeat, Superman has Brainiac reprogrammed in order to serve him and the Earth, and help run Superman's Global Soviet Union, a task he takes to for the next four decades. While serving Superman, Brainiac repeatedly advises him to take more drastic courses of action to resolve his problems, such as suggesting he merely invade Luthor's United States, though Superman always rebuffs his most extreme suggestions. At the climax of the story, after Luthor infiltrates his capitol, Superman does decide to invade the United States, defeating a futuristic U.S. Pacific Fleet and an army of superbeings (including Wonder Woman, Green Lantern and Doomsday) along the way. Luthor himself is yanked down deep into the recesses of the Fortress by Brainiac to be converted surgically into a Superman robot. Brainiac and Superman storm the White House after defeating all the U.S.'s defenders. They are greeted by Lois Luthor with the last weapon, a small note written by President Lex Luthor that reads, \\"Why don't you just put the whole world in a bottle, Superman?\\". Superman, realizing the error of his ways, is horrified by the revelation that he has essentially become another Brainiac- \\"an alien bullying a less- developed species.\\" He calls off the invasion, but Brainiac objects; he reveals that his twelfth-level intellect let him easily subvert any attempts at reprogramming him, and that he has never been under Superman's control. He attacks Superman with a kryptonite beam weapon, nearly killing him while boasting about how he will conquer the entire universe after finishing off all his foes on Earth. However, he is finally defeated when Luthor (having escaped surgery through undisclosed means) hacks and shuts off Brainiac from the inside. His body is promptly destroyed by Superman. In one last act of spite, Brainiac's death automatically triggers his ship's self-destruct, which, according to Luthor, would eradicate the entire Earth and everything within a 15,000,000 mile radius. As the gravitational singularities powering Brainiac's ship threaten to explode, Superman rockets it into outer space, where it blows up. The Earth is saved, but Superman is thought to have been caught in an explosion and killed. In the epilogue at Lex Luthor's funeral a thousand years in the future, it is revealed that unbeknownst to the rest of the Earth, Superman survived the destruction of Brainiac's ship. He walks quietly away from the ceremony, planning to live among humans rather than ruling over them. ===JLA: Earth-2=== In the JLA: Earth 2 one-shot, the Justice League are drawn to the anti-matter universe to defeat the Crime Syndicate of America, their villainous anti-matter counterparts, with Brainiac apparently acting as the robotic servant of Ultraman. However, after the Syndicate travel to the League's universe, it is revealed that the true mastermind of the scheme was Brainiac, who is revealed to be an organic life form trapped in a tank acting as Ultraman's servant, having manipulated both teams into a position where they will be trapped in each other's worlds and thus unable to win, as the nature of each world means that 'good' and 'evil' will always win in each world. However, Brainiac is defeated when the League deliberately walks away so that the Syndicate can return in time to stop him. ===Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again=== In Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again, set in a world where heroes have been publicly 'retired' for years as Lex Luthor took over and blackmailed assorted heroes into acting as his discreet 'servants', Brainiac is working with Luthor to keep the city of Kandor contained, the two destroying one Kryptonian family each time Superman defies them. He is eventually destroyed by Lara, the daughter of Superman and Wonder Woman, who claims to be surrendering to him only to allow the Atom to break the bottle from inside and allow the Kryptonians within to access their powers, decimating Brainiac with their heat vision.Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again #1-3 (November 2001-July 2002) ===Bizarro Brainiac=== Bizarro #1 created this doppelganger of Brainiac to live on Bizarro World. Since Brainiac shrunk the city of Kandor, his Bizarro counterpart felt compelled to do the opposite, and expanded a city in Antarctica, creating Big City.Supergirl and the Legion of Super-Heroes #20 (September 2006) ===Flashpoint=== In the alternate timeline of the Flashpoint event, Brainiac is the ruler of 31st century Earth, and has captured Kid Flash, whom he then placed in stasis, but Hot Pursuit managed to rescue the young speedster.Flashpoint: Kid Flash Lost #1 (June 2011) Escaping from Brainiac's base, Kid Flash and Hot Pursuit formulate a plan to return to the 21st century. Kid Flash then allows himself to be recaptured by Brainiac and put into stasis. Kid Flash uses his super-speed in the virtual reality access port to shut down the security program and Hot Pursuit then blasts Brainiac from behind. While they used his orb energy to return to the past, Brainiac impaled Hot Pursuit and attacked Kid Flash. Hot Pursuit breaks the orb energy projector to allow Kid Flash's super-speed to return. Kid Flash then returns to the 21st century, promising to rescue Hot Pursuit from Brainiac.Flashpoint: Kid Flash Lost #2 (July 2011) ===Justice League/Power Rangers=== Brainiac is one of the villains in the Justice League/Power Rangers crossover, when the Power Rangers and Lord Zedd accidentally travel to the DC Universe through a teleportation accident, with the Rangers arriving in Gotham City,Justice League/Power Rangers #1 while Zedd finds himself in one of the trapped cities on Brainiac's ship. Escaping from the bottle, Zedd proposes an alliance with Brainiac in exchange for providing Brainiac with a city from his Earth, Zedd releasing a wave of monsters across the world to distract the Justice League.Justice League/Power Rangers #2 Using the distraction of Zedd's monsters, Brainiac dispatches his drones to take control of the Rangers' zords, stealing their powers and fleeing back to their world, forcing the Rangers and the Justice League to 'borrow' the Hadron Collider to create a temporary dimensional transporter that will allow them all to get back to the Rangers' world.Justice League/Power Rangers #3 Back in the Rangers' world, Brainiac nearly takes control of Cyborg, but Billy Cranston is able to regain his powers in time to take Cyborg downJustice League/Power Rangers #4 so that Batman can reboot him. Brainiac has captured Alpha 5, officially to question him as the only other example of independent artificial sentience he has ever met, but Alpha, although speculating that Brainiac abducted him because the villain is lonely, rejects the idea that the two are similar, arguing that Brainiac's actions show a selfishness and an inability to grow where true sentience relies on making oneself open to working with others. After regaining their powers, the Rangers are able to rescue Alpha and force Brainiac into retreat.Justice League/Power Rangers #5 ===Adventures of Supergirl=== In the Adventures of Supergirl comic, which takes place in the universe of the Supergirl TV series, a very different version of Vril Dox appears as a recurring villain. In this series, he is a greedy, green-skinned alien hacker from the planet Yod who was hired by an as- yet-unknown individual to frame Supergirl's ally Winn Schott for funding and aiding terrorism. When Supergirl accesses Winn's computer, he presents himself falsely as an A.I. system called V.R.I.L., and pretends to be a creation of Schott's. He figures out Supergirl's real identity and plans to expose her, then he electrocutes her ally James Olsen from through Winn's computer. Eventually, Vril is tracked down by Supergirl with the aid of Winn and an expert hacker he knew, and Supergirl easily defeated him, after which he was arrested.Adventures of Supergirl #2 (print) (or Adventures of Supergirl #4-5 (digital)) ==In other mediaTelevision=== Live-action * James Marsters primarily played Brainiac in Smallville, while additional portrayals have also been done by John Schneider (Jonathan Kent in season five), John Glover (Lionel Luthor in season seven), Laura Vandervoort (Kara Zor-El in season seven) and Allison Mack (Chloe Sullivan in season eight). Acting as a central antagonist for seasons five and seven and a supporting villain for season eight, Brainiac is mostly referred to by his assumed name of \\"Milton Fine\\", but Jor-El refers to him as the BRAIN InterActive Construct. The Smallville interpretation is similar to the DC animated universe version; a self-aware computer in humanoid form with a Kryptonian origin who had a part in the planet's destruction (having destabilized Krypton's core alongside Zod) but is portrayed as a shapeshifting AI created by Dax-Ur (who abandoned the project) and completed by Jor-El but corrupted by Zod. Introduced in season five (though alluded in season four's finale where he was part of the Ship carrying the Disciples of Zod), he first appears under the Milton Fine name, posing as a history professor at (fictional) Central Kansas A&M; University and presenting himself as a Kryptonian ally to trick Clark Kent into releasing Zod. Proclaiming Jor-El was a murderer and the one who infected Mrs. Kent with a virus while Zod was the hero of all Krypton. But after Clark learns the truth, Brainiac fights off with his own Kryptonian-esque powers and then manipulates Lex Luthor into creating a 'vaccine' that will make Luthor's body suitable to act as Zod's new host after temporarily shutting down all of Earth's electronics with a virus. Although apparently destroyed, Brainiac is restored in season seven. The weakened humanoid manipulated Clark into helping regain his full power by locating Dax-Ur, to which he killed by downloading his creator's memories before convincing Luthor that Clark is a threat by impersonating Kara Zor-El and revealing Clark's secret identity to Luthor, but is defeated in battle by Clark and seemingly killed. However, Brainiac returns in season eight, possessing Chloe Sullivan to use as a means of unleashing Doomsday through Davis Bloome on Earth, as part of Zod's contingency plan. The Legion of Super-Heroes assist Clark in extracting Brainiac from Chloe and taking him to the future, but are too late to stop him from releasing Doomsday. A reprogrammed version of Brainiac returns in season ten from the future, offering Clark advice on his future growth as a superhero. ** An alternate version of Brainiac/Milton Fine appears in the season seven episode \\"Apocalypse\\". Living in a universe where Kal-El never arrived on Earth, Brainiac is Chief of Staff, under President Lex Luthor and alongside Kara Zor- El (under the name \\"Agent Danvers\\"). When the appearance of Kal-El from another universe exposed Brainiac to those around him, Lex shot Clark and Kara and activated a Nuclear football to destroy most of the planet to remake. With his directives of destroying humanity and with Lex as the vessel for Zod, Brainiac was about to kill Clark, when Jor-El brought Clark back to his native reality. * Brainiac is referenced multiple times in Supergirl. His Coluan descendant Indigo appears as a villain in the first season, who is referred to as \\"a member of the Brainiac clan\\". Another of his descendants, the heroic Brainiac 5 is later featured as a member of the 31st century's Legion of Super-Heroes. In the episode \\"Battles Lost and Won\\", Brainiac 5, reveals that in stopping the Blight in the present day timeline, the original Brainiac has been resurrected in the future. * Brainiac appears as the main antagonist of the first season of Krypton, portrayed by Blake Ritson. Feared throughout the universe as \\"The Collector of Worlds\\", Brainiac targets Krypton and seeks to steal the capital city of Kandor before destroying the entire planet. To prevent him from doing so, Seg-El sacrifices himself and banishes Brainiac to the Phantom Zone. In season two, Brainiac transfers his consciousness into Seg's mind while they are trapped together. During the finale, Brainiac manages to separate himself from Seg and leaves in his starship. The character, sporting a look similar to his post-2008 incarnation, was created via a combination of extensive makeup/prosthetics and CGI.Here's your first look at Superman villain Brainiac on the Syfy prequel series 'Krypton'. USA News. Animation * Brainiac made his first television appearance in six episodes of the 1966 Filmation animated series The New Adventures of Superman, voiced by Cliff Owens. * Brainiac appears as a member of the Legion of Doom in Challenge of the Super Friends voiced by Ted Cassidy. * Brainiac appears in a Super Friends short episode \\"Superclone\\", voiced by Stanley Ralph Ross. * The mechanical version of Brainiac appeared in Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show in the episodes \\"The Wrath of Brainiac\\" and \\"The Village of Lost Souls\\" again voiced by Stanley Ralph Ross. * Brainiac appears in the The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians episode \\"Brain Child\\", once again voiced by Stanley Ralph Ross. Brainiac as he appears in the DC animated universe. Brainiac merged with Lex Luthor as seen in Justice League Unlimited. * Brainiac is prominently featured in the DC animated universe, voiced by Corey Burton. ** The character first appears in the pilot episode of Superman: The Animated Series \\"The Last Son of Krypton\\", in which he is depicted as the supercomputer that runs Krypton. He dismisses Jor-El's warnings about the planet's imminent destruction while secretly working to save himself by transferring his consciousness into a satellite and creating an android body. Brainiac then travels to other planets and assimilates their information before destroying them, believing that the universe's vast knowledge would be more precious if only he possessed it. In \\"Stolen Memories\\", Brainiac arrives on Earth decades later under the pretence of a peaceful exchange of knowledge with Lex Luthor. Jor-El's son Kal-El, who also survived Krypton's destruction and has since lived on Earth as Metropolis' hero Superman, discovers Brainiac's true intentions to betray Luthor and seemingly kills him by destroying his starship. In \\"Ghost in the Machine\\", it is revealed that Brainiac downloaded into LexCorp's computers prior to his defeat, and he subsequently forces Luthor to build him a new body. In \\"Knight Time\\", Brainiac is revealed to have entered Wayne Enterprises' technological database during Bruce Wayne's business partnership with LexCorp, and he uses nanites to brainwash Bruce into commissioning the construction of a spaceship so he can leave Earth. In \\"New Kids in Town\\", a version of Brainiac from the year 2979 travels back in time to kill a teenage Clark Kent in Smallville before he can become Superman, only for his plot to be foiled by the Legion of Superheroes. ** Brainiac returns in Justice League. In the two-part episode \\"Twilight\\", he attacks the planet Apokolips intending to assimilate its knowledge before destroying it. However, Darkseid strikes a deal with Brainiac; in exchange for the former's help in luring Superman and the Justice League, the latter would spare Apokolips. Upon capturing Superman in his massive asteroid headquarters, Brainiac attempts to extract the Kryptonian's DNA and create an organic body for himself but Darkseid overrides his circuitry to find the Anti-Life Equation instead. In the ensuing battle with the Justice League, both Brainiac and Darkseid are destroyed when the asteroid implodes. ** Brainiac also appears in Static Shock. In the two-part crossover episode \\"A League of Their Own\\", a circuit board of Brainiac is kept in stasis on the Watchtower. He is reactivated during an anomaly and gains control of the facility. When Static and Gear attempt to rid the Watchtower of his program, Brainiac transfers his consciousness into Gear and brainwashes him into rebuilding his body. Brainiac's voice was pitched down for this show, as the producers of Static Shock wanted a more \\"monstrous\\" performance from Corey Burton as opposed to his usual cold and remorseless depiction of the character. ** Brainiac once more returns in Justice League Unlimited. The second season's two-part finale reveals a major plot twist that dates back to the Superman: The Animated Series episode \\"Ghost in the Machine\\", in which Brainiac secretly implanted a nanotech payload of his program into Lex Luthor's body as a failsafe. Since then, he has remained dormant within Luthor while subtly influencing his actions, curing his Kryptonite cancer and giving him super strength. Intending to transfer his consciousness into a duplicate of Amazo, Brainiac manipulates Luthor into funding Project Cadmus to obtain the nanotechnology needed to create this new body. He only reveals himself when the Justice League and Amanda Waller attempt to apprehend Luthor. As the two escape, Luthor convinces Brainiac to use the alien Dark Heart technology at Cadmus to merge and recreate the universe in their shared image. Although they manage to defeat the League, their plan is ultimately foiled when the Flash taps into the Speed Force to purge Brainiac from Luthor's body. The third and final season reveals that Brainiac's consciousness survives and is able to communicate with Luthor. Obsessed with remerging with Brainiac, Luthor joins the Secret Society in order to obtain the last piece of him on Earth, which has fallen into Gorilla Grodd's possession. Luthor overthrows Grodd and travels to the ruins of Brainiac's asteroid headquarters with the intention of siphoning his essence from the debris but inadvertently revives Darkseid instead. * Brainiac appears in season two of Legion of Super Heroes, with Corey Burton reprising his role. In the episode \\"Message in a Bottle\\", his descendent Brainiac 5 reveals that his abduction of the capital city of Kandor is what caused Krypton's destruction. In the two-part series finale \\"Dark Victory\\", Brainiac takes control of Brainiac 5 and kills Imperiex, intending to conquer the universe himself. After being defeated by the Legion, Brainiac is revealed to have survived and begins rebuilding himself. While Legion of Super-Heroes is not set within the same continuity as the DC Animated Universe, this version of Brainiac shares the same voice actor and musical leitmotif as his DCAU counterpart. * Brainiac is featured in Batman: The Brave and the Bold, voiced by Richard McGonagle. * Brainiac makes a cameo appearance in the Teen Titans Go! episode \\"Laundry Day\\". * In The Looney Tunes Show episode \\"SuperRabbit\\", Marvin the Martian portrays Brainiac. * Brainiac appears in Justice League Action, voiced by John de Lancie. ===Film=== Live action * During the early development of Superman III, Ilya Salkind wrote a script in that Brainiac was featured as the main antagonist. However, when Leslie Newman and David Newman rewrote the script, Brainiac was cut from the film. Late actor Richard Pryor was considered for the role. * Brainiac was considered as a villain in the scrapped Superman Reborn and Superman Lives film projects. Most notably, the villain was featured with Doomsday in Kevin Smith's version of the script, which was later discarded by director Tim Burton. Burton's own script included Brainiac's intellect bonding with Lex Luthor, as would later happen in Justice League Unlimited (and which had previously been seen in the comic book story Superman: Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?). Christopher Walken, Jim Carrey and Gary Oldman (the three portrayed different characters in Batman films) were considered for the role. * In 2007, film director Bryan Singer reported that he wanted to use Brainiac, along with Bizarro, as an antagonist in the cancelled Superman: The Man of Steel, the planned sequel to Superman Returns. However, the project was finally scrapped by Warner Bros. * Brainiac has been suggested as \\"definitely down the road\\" as a villain in the DC Extended Universe and future Man of Steel sequels by director Zack Snyder. There are nods to Brainiac in Man of Steel such as the skull shape of the codex, the tentacles attached to the World Engine, and General Zod experiencing sensory overloads when exposed to Earth's atmosphere, similar to Brainiac's weakness. Animation * Brainiac appears as the titular antagonist in the 2006 direct-to-video animated feature Superman: Brainiac Attacks voiced by Lance Henriksen. The movie begins with Brainiac landing on Earth in a meteor. Brainiac goes around absorbing information until Superman destroys him with his Arctic-breath. However, Lex Luthor is able to save a piece of Brainiac and forms an alliance with the Kryptonian robot. Luthor gives Brainiac a new body, made from his satellite weapon. Brainiac is also equipped with a kryptonite beam and the ability to track Superman by his Kryptonian DNA. Luthor and Brainiac's bargain revolves around Brainiac using his new body to destroy Superman, and afterwards, Brainiac would allow himself to be \\"defeated\\" by Luthor and leave for another planet so that Luthor would appear as a hero. However, Brainiac betrayed Luthor after he believed Superman was destroyed, but in the end, Superman returned to defeat Brainiac after a lengthy battle. This time, Superman made sure that this copy of Brainiac was completely destroyed. * Brainiac appears as the main antagonist in the animated film Superman: Unbound, based on the story arc Superman: Brainiac by Geoff Johns and Gary Frank. Brainiac is voiced by John Noble. Originally a scientist on his home world of Colu, Vril Dox became obsessed with learning everything there was to know in the universe. He subjected himself to extensive genetic and cybernetic enhancements, transforming his Coluan body into the towering cyborg the universe would come to know as Brainiac. He constructed a ship, designed to interface with his cybernetic implants and become an extension of his own body and will, and began to travel through space, absorbing information on other planets and civilizations. A flaw in his cybernetic brain made Brainiac incapable of accepting that, since living planets were always changing and civilizations evolving, learning everything was impossible. To remedy this, Brainiac created an army of robotic soldiers he would use to attack cities on inhabited planets, killing anyone they deemed redundant, before using a special force field projector to shrink the cities down to the size of a model he would keep stored on his ship. After capturing a city from a planet, Brainiac would launch a missile he called a Solar Aggressor into the planet's sun, causing it to go supernova and consume the rest of the planet, preventing any new data from ever entering the universe. To prevent his prisoners from trying to escape, Brainiac used his robots to maintain the cities and quell any signs of rebellion. After capturing the city of Kandor on the planet Krypton, Brainiac detected activity in the planet's core that showed the world was about to explode on its own, and thus saved himself the trouble of using a Solar Aggressor. This would ultimately prove to be his undoing. * Brainiac makes a cameo appearance in the animated film Lego Batman: The Movie - DC Super Heroes Unite, an adaptation of the video game of the same name, with Troy Baker reprising his role. * Brainiac appears in Lego DC Comics Super Heroes: Justice League: Cosmic Clash, voiced by Phil LaMarr. This version miniaturizes, bottles and collects entire planets, rather than cities. He plans to do so to Earth in order to complete his collection. He uses a weapon to scatter Superman, Wonder Woman and Green Lantern throughout time to support his plans. Although Batman and Flash succeed in sending their fellow Justice Leaguers to the present and Cyborg and Supergirl manage to slow down Brainiac's forces, Brainiac succeeds in shrinking and bottling Earth. However, the League use a massive mech to release Earth and restore it to its normal size. Feeling he has no purpose, Brainiac sets himself to self- destruct. Due to the large blast radius, Batman convinces Brainiac to collect coins to avoid Brainiac from detonating. Brainiac is then arrested and put in prison. * Brainiac appears as the final villain in DC Super Hero Girls: Intergalactic Games, voiced by Fred Tatasciore. He appears as the mastermind behind Lena Luthor. After she fails to kill the heroes, Brainiac leave her to drown and use the robots (including Platinum, one of the Metal Men) she used to build himself a giant body with all weapons needed to counter the superheroes' powers. His robotic body is destroyed with the combined efforts of the heroes through Platinum, who sacrifices herself to destroy him. However at the end, he is still alive and takes off to places unknown. * Brainiac appears as the main antagonist of the animated film Superman: Red Son, based on the graphic novel of the same name. Brainiac is voiced by Paul Williams. ===Video games=== * Brainiac served as the final boss in the Superman arcade game published by Taito Corporation in 1988. * Brainiac was the final boss in the 1992 Sunsoft game Superman. * In Superman 64, Brainiac from the DCAU appears not only as a level boss, but also as a playable character in multiplayer. However, when the player faces Brainiac in the game's final level, Brainiac simply stands in place unless the player attempts to use heat vision on him. * Superman was forced to stop Brainiac and save the world after Brainiac kidnapped Lois Lane in the Sega Master System and Sega Genesis video game Superman: Man of Steel. * In the Xbox video game Superman: Man of Steel, Brainiac 13 is the game's final boss. Players must compete against B13 drones throughout the game, before facing the android on the final level. * Brainiac was featured in the concept art in the console versions and as a main boss in the Nintendo DS version of Superman Returns, looking vastly different from other incarnations. * Brainiac is a featured in the video game Justice League Heroes voiced by Peter Jessop. In the game, Brainiac first invaded S.T.A.R. Labs and ordered a huge legion of robots to seal off the area. Batman and Superman head for S.T.A.R. Labs, destroy Brainiac's robots, and battle Brainiac. Later the League infiltrates his underground fortress on earth and engages Brainiac in combat. Brainiac, defeated, is later resurrected/possessed by the villain Darkseid. * Corey Burton reprises his role as Brainiac in DC Universe Online. Here, Brainiac returns to Earth and both superheroes and other supervillains of the DC universe appeal to a truce to combat Brainiac. He is also (indirectly) the source of the player characters' powers, as a future version of Lex Luthor used his technology to create \\"exobytes\\", highly advanced nanorobots with the ability to infuse an organic host with superpowers. Brainiac also appears to be able to create Avatars and Sub- Avatars from the digitized information on superhuman powers, enormous robots that use technological, meta- or magical abilities. * In the video game Scribblenauts Unmasked: A DC Comics Adventure, Brainiac is the secret leader of the supervillains and the main antagonist. With the help of the Scribblenauts' Doppelg√§nger, he wants to use the Starites and Lily's globe to summon and merge with the other 51 Brainiacs and become a \\"perfect\\" being. He unites with other DC Comics villains to obtain the Starites, each failing to do so. When the Justice League arrives, he hacks Cyborg and uses Lex Luthor, the Joker, Harley Quinn, the Cheetah, Professor Zoom, the Ocean Master and the Sinestro Corps to fight their respective nemeses, again, each failing. When the Justice League reach Brainiac, he steals Lily's globe, adds the last Starite, teleports the Justice League away and puts his plan into action. After betraying Doppelganger, Brainiac and his clones begin to merge. Maxwell manages to summon alternate versions of the Justice League to defeat him and retrieve the globe. * Brainiac will appear in Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, likely as the game's primary antagonist, as the trailer implies he is behind the brainwashing of the Justice League. Injustice series * Brainiac makes a cameo appearance in the IOS/Android versions of Injustice: Gods Among Us as a support card. * Brainiac appears as the central antagonist and a playable character in Injustice 2, voiced by Jeffrey Combs. This version of Brainiac has destroyed billions of populated worlds, including Krypton‚Äîa departure from most versions, where he merely collects Kandor and moves on, leaving the planet to die a natural death. Before destroying Krypton, he manages to add both Kandor and Argo City to his collection (as revealed in Supergirl's ending). Alerted to Earth and the existence of Superman, whom he believes is the last Kryptonian, after Superman's Regime kills many members of the Green Lantern Corps, Brainiac arrives on Earth to collect its cities, putting him in conflict with both the Regime and Batman's Insurgency. He conspires with Gorilla Grodd and the Society, who assist Brainiac in his invasion, though once it becomes apparent that Brainiac plans to destroy Earth the Society disbands. Gorilla Grodd continues to serve Brainiac, plotting to overthrow and kill Brainiac and take control of his ship, but is killed by Aquaman and Black Adam during the invasion of Kahndaq before he can do so. He is surprised to learn that Kara Zor-El survived the attack on Krypton alongside her cousin‚Äîher ship was knocked off course and she was put into suspended animation, to later be found by Black Adam and taken in by the surviving remnants of the Regime‚Äîand seeks to add her to his collection as well. The superheroes and supervillains of the Insurgency and Regime are all forced to band together in order to have a chance at stopping him. After Superman defeats Batman and the Insurgency and restores the Regime's rule over Earth, he kills Brainiac, and frees all of the warriors trapped in Brainiac's collection, giving him an army of billions of Kryptonian, Daxamite, and Czarnian soldiers to use to maintain his control over Earth. Superman also bonds with Brainiac's ship, and uses its technology to turn Batman into a mindless slave. Superman then confronts an imprisoned Supergirl, and, to her horror, threatens to do the same thing to her if she does not join the Regime. In Brainiac's own ending, the version that defeated Brainiac will turn out to be his descendant. The other characters' endings will either have Brainiac killed or handed over to the authorities. The Injustice version of Brainiac is mostly based on the post-2008 version of the character, being a genetically and cybernetically enhanced Coluan scientist with a twelfth-level intellect, his signature skull ship, an army of robotic probes, a fleet of mentally- controlled smaller ships, and the strength/durability to physically match Superman. In addition to Brainiac 5, Brainiac 6 is referenced in his pre- battle dialogue if Brainiac fights Brainiac, with one of them revealing he is the other's descendant and the other challenging him to prove his worth as an heir. Lego series * Brainiac makes an appearance in Lego Batman 2: DC Super Heroes, voiced by Troy Baker. He is seen briefly in the final scene of the main story watching Earth from an orbiting spaceship, and after witnessing Green Lantern shoot a green beam summoning others to the planet, Brainiac mutters \\"I have located it.\\" Brainiac is also a boss fight and unlockable character, found in Gotham Park. * Brainiac appears in Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham as the main antagonist, now voiced by Dee Bradley Baker. He summons representatives of all known Lantern Corps (such as Sinestro, Atrocitus, Star Sapphire, and Hal Jordan) in order to claim their energies, which will power a crystal that will shrink Earth. According to him, he has lost his appetite for simple cities and plans to claim entire worlds. The Justice League and the Legion of Doom defeat him on his ship, but the villain escapes as his ship crashes in Gotham. Brainiac returns once Earth is returned to normal size, mind-controlling a giant-sized Superman, but is eventually defeated and shrunk himself, placed next to Lex Luthor and the Joker in Arkham Asylum. However, Luthor inadvertently breaks the bottle holding him, freeing him once again, after which Brainiac, as shown with a clenched fist, prepares to vengefully attack them. * Dee Bradley Baker reprises his role for a brief cameo in Lego Dimensions. Brainiac is summoned to Middle-Earth by the Riddler to battle the heroes with mind-controlled Orcs. * Brainiac appears as a playable character in Lego DC Super-Villains, with Corey Burton reprising his role from the DC Animated Universe. He is unlocked by collecting his token in the final level. Brainiac is also mentioned in the game's story, when Gorilla Grodd, Killer Frost, Scarecrow, and the Rookie travel to Smallville in search for something to get them to space and suggest using Brainiac's ship. ===Web series=== Brainiac appears in the second episode of Justice League: Gods and Monsters Chronicles (a companion to Justice League: Gods and Monsters), voiced by Tara Strong. This version is depicted as a contingency plan set by Doctor Sivana to take down Superman. Brainiac is shown to have lost control over his immeasurable psychic powers, creating an energy dome around himself in Metropolis. The effects are shown to take down attack helicopters and send cars flying. As stated by his creator, only a small nuclear warhead could stop him, or Superman. Superman shows up and penetrates the dome, seeing Brainiac for who he is: a crying, blue-skinned child with three diodes on his head, missing his left arm. Despite his attempts to reason with him and talk Brainiac into controlling his powers, Superman reluctantly kills Brainiac with his heat vision, at the boy's behest, to put him out of his misery, much to his regret. ===Books=== * Brainiac appears in The Last Days of Krypton, a novel by Kevin J. Anderson. This version of Brainiac is known as the Brain InterActive Construct, later renamed Brainiac by Commissioner Zod. Brainiac had admired the beauty and architecture of Kandor, and wanted to preserve the city from destruction should disaster strike Krypton as it did on his home planet of Colu. Zod permitted Brainiac's taking of Kandor, stating that Brainiac could have the city, as the rest of Krypton belonged to him. Brainiac's ship fired three lasers that pummeled the surrounding crust around Kandor and literally upheaved the city from Krypton's surface. A force field was then erected around the city which contracted, shrinking the city and its inhabitants. Brainiac departed without causing further destruction or seizing other Kryptonian cities. * Brainiac (referred to again as \\"The Collector of Worlds\\") is introduced in issue #20 of the Young Justice comic series, based on the show.Young Justice (vol. 2) #20 (November 2012) ==ReferencesCategory:Animated series villains Category:Comics characters introduced in 1958 Category:DC Comics aliens Category:DC Comics characters who can move at superhuman speeds Category:DC Comics characters with superhuman strength Category:DC Comics robots Category:DC Comics telepaths Category:Extraterrestrial supervillains Category:Fictional androids Category:Fictional artificial intelligences Category:Fictional characters who can duplicate themselves Category:Fictional characters with spirit possession or body swapping abilities Category:Fictional computers Category:Fictional inventors Category:Fictional mass murderers Category:Fictional robots Category:Fictional scientists Category:Fictional shapeshifters Category:Fictional technopaths Category:Kryptonians Category:Robot supervillains Category:Robots in television Category:Fictional amorphous creatures Category:Fictional professors Category:Characters created by Otto Binder Category:Fictional cyborgs Category:Male characters in comics Category:DC Comics male supervillains Category:Video game bosses ","title":"Brainiac (character)"},{"id":"525161","text":"Brainiac (sometimes stylized as 3RA1N1AC) was an American Indie rock band formed in 1992, and disbanded after the sudden death of lead singer Tim Taylor in 1997. ==Biography== Brainiac was formed in Dayton, Ohio, United States in January 1992 with vocalist, guitarist and keyboard player (particularly Moog synthesizers) Tim Taylor (July 20, 1968 - May 23, 1997), bassist Monostereo (Juan Monasterio), guitarist Michelle Bodine and drummer Tyler Trent. On March 12, the band played its first show at Wright State's University Cafeteria, under the name We'll Eat Anything. After a slew of singles, they released their debut album, Smack Bunny Baby, on Grass/BMG Records in 1993. Bonsai Superstar, now with John Schmersal on guitar in place of Bodine, followed the next year. In 1995 they played on the Lollapalooza side stage and recorded four songs in the UK for the BBC Radio 1 Peel Sessions. They joined Touch and Go Records and released Internationale, produced by Kim Deal (of the Pixies). The following year, their third album, Hissing Prigs in Static Couture, was released on the Touch & Go label. All three of their albums were produced by Eli Janney (of Girls Against Boys). Brainiac generated a buzz as the live act to see that resulted in opening tours for Beck, the Breeders and the Jesus Lizard and receiving offers from major labels. In 1997, they released an electronic-based EP called Electro-Shock for President which turned out to be their last record: Taylor was killed in a car accident on May 23, 1997, during the pre-production for their fourth album, which was due out on Interscope Records. The group soon disbanded. A benefit show featuring The Breeders and Guided By Voices took place a few months later. ==Aftermath and legacy== After recording a solo album under the name John Stuart Mill,[ Bio John Stuart Mill], AllMusic guitarist John Schmersal later went on to form Enon. Monasterio directs music videos, including two for Enon, and released in 2008 an EP with a new band called Model/Actress with Curtis Mead and Charlie Walker from Chamberlain and ex-Bullet LaVolta drummer Philips; Schmersal makes appearances on this album. Trent briefly joined the Breeders and most recently played with The Dirty Walk. Bodine became the guitarist and singer of O-matic and Shesus. In early 2019, a documentary entitled Transmissions After Zero was released by directed Eric Mahoney to favorable reviews. This included several live performances at various locations, with friend Tim Krug including New York, Los Angeles and their hometown of Dayton, Ohio. The film was released on DVD and streaming on February 21, 2020. The surviving members of Brainiac also appeared on an episode of Conan Neutron's Protonic Reversal to discuss the career of the band, the death of Tim Taylor and the documentary. ==Members== * Tim Taylor - vocals, guitar, keyboards (1992-1997, his death) * Juan \\"Monostereo\\" Monasterio - bass (1992-1997) * Michelle Bodine - guitar (1992-1994) * John Schmersal - guitar (1994-1997) * Tyler Trent - drums (1992-1997) ==DiscographyStudio albums=== *Smack Bunny Baby (1993, Grass/BMG) *Bonsai Superstar (1994, Grass/BMG) *Hissing Prigs in Static Couture (1996, Touch & Go) ===Singles/EPs=== *Superduperseven 7\\" (1992, Limited Potential) *I Could Own You (Live) 7\\" (split single with Bratmobile, 1993, 12x12 Records) *Dexatrim 7\\" (split single with Lazy, 1994, Simple Solution) (John Schmersal's debut as new guitarist) *Cookie Doesn't Sing 7\\" (split single w/Today Is The Day, Chrome Cranks, and Steel Pole Bathtub Vol. 10/ CD Comp., 1995, Dope-Guns-'N-Fucking In The Streets Vols. 8-11, Amphetamine Reptile Records) *Internationale (7\\" single/EP {features new recording of \\"Simon Says\\" off Superduperseven 7\\"}, 1995, Touch & Go) *Go! 4x7\\" single (Jabberjaw Vol. 6, CD Comp., 1996, Mammoth Records) *Electro-Shock for President EP (1997, Touch & Go) *Petrified single (Ubu Dance Party: A Tribute To Pere Ubu, CD Comp., 1997, Datapanic) ==Influence== Chris Walla of Death Cab for Cutie claimed Brainiac influenced his work on Narrow Stairs.

The party and its rival, the Liberals, have alternated in power since responsible government was granted in 1851. ==History== The policies of the Liberals and Progressive Conservatives (PCs) are very similar. The major differences are in their allegiances to federal parties and in personalities. The PC Party began as the Conservative Party of Prince Edward Island, and changed its name in 1942 to reflect the development of the federal Progressive Conservative Party. The Progressive Conservatives formed the government in Prince Edward Island under Premier Pat Binns, starting in 1996. The party lost its bid for a fourth mandate in 2007. In October 2010, following the resignation of Binns as party leader (in 2007), a leadership election was held. Jim Bagnall became interim leader of the party in 2010 when rookie MLA Olive Crane decided to seek the permanent leadership of the party. Crane won the PC leadership in October 2010, and served for over two years. She resigned as party leader on 31 January 2013, and was succeeded by Steven Myers as interim leader. Rob Lantz was elected leader of the party at a leadership election on February 28, 2015 at the University of Prince Edward Island Sports Centre, but resigned on September 23, 2015 after failing to win a seat in the 2015 provincial election.\\"P.E.I.

The field organizes languages on the basis of how those languages form words by combining morphemes. Analytic languages contain very little inflection, instead relying on features like word order and auxiliary words to convey meaning. Synthetic languages, ones that are not analytic, are divided into two categories: agglutinative and fusional languages. Agglutinative languages rely primarily on discrete particles (prefixes, suffixes, and infixes) for inflection, while fusional languages \\"fuse\\" inflectional categories together, often allowing one word ending to contain several categories, such that the original root can be difficult to extract. A further subcategory of agglutinative languages are polysynthetic languages, which take agglutination to a higher level by constructing entire sentences, including nouns, as one word. Analytic, fusional, and agglutinative languages can all be found in many regions of the world. However, each category is dominant in some families and regions and essentially nonexistent in others. Analytic languages encompass the Sino-Tibetan family, including Chinese, many languages in Southeast Asia, the Pacific, and West Africa, and a few of the Germanic languages. Fusional languages encompass most of the Indo- European family‚Äîfor example, French, Russian, and Hindi‚Äîas well as the Semitic family and a few members of the Uralic family. Most of the world's languages, however, are agglutinative, including the Turkic, Japonic, and Bantu languages and most families in the Americas, Australia, the Caucasus, and non-Slavic Russia. Constructed languages take a variety of morphological alignments. The concept of discrete morphological categories has not been without criticism. Some linguists argue that most, if not all, languages are in a permanent state of transition, normally from fusional to analytic to agglutinative to fusional again. Others take issue with the definitions of the categories, arguing that they conflate several distinct, if related, variables. ==History== English), fusional (French), and agglutinative (Plains Cree) The field was first developed by brothers Friedrich von Schlegel and August von Schlegel. ==Analytic languages== Vietnamese\\" in Vietnamese. Note the tonal, single- syllable nature of the words; this is frequent in analytic languages, i.e. ones in which there is little to no inflection and words stand on their own. Analytic languages show a low ratio of morphemes to words; in fact, the correspondence is nearly one-to-one. Sentences in analytic languages are composed of independent root morphemes. Grammatical relations between words are expressed by separate words where they might otherwise be expressed by affixes, which are present to a minimal degree in such languages. There is little to no morphological change in words: they tend to be uninflected. Grammatical categories are indicated by word order (for example, inversion of verb and subject for interrogative sentences) or by bringing in additional words (for example, a word for \\"some\\" or \\"many\\" instead of a plural inflection like English -s). Individual words carry a general meaning (root concept); nuances are expressed by other words. Finally, in analytic languages context and syntax are more important than morphology. Analytic languages include some of the major East Asian languages, such as Chinese, and Vietnamese. Note that the ideographic writing systems of these languages play a strong role in regimenting linguistic continuity according to an analytic, or isolating, morphology (cf. orthography). Additionally, English is moderately analytic, and it and Afrikaans can be considered as some of the most analytic of all Indo-European languages. However, they are traditionally analyzed as fusional languages. A related concept is the isolating language, one in which there is only one, or on average close to one, morpheme per word. Not all analytic languages are isolating; for example, Chinese and English possess many compound words, but contain few inflections for them. ==Synthetic languages== Synthetic languages form words by affixing a given number of dependent morphemes to a root morpheme. The morphemes may be distinguishable from the root, or they may not. They may be fused with it or among themselves (in that multiple pieces of grammatical information may potentially be packed into one morpheme). Word order is less important for these languages than it is for analytic languages, since individual words express the grammatical relations that would otherwise be indicated by syntax. In addition, there tends to be a high degree of concordance (agreement, or cross-reference between different parts of the sentence). Therefore, morphology in synthetic languages is more important than syntax. Most Indo-European languages are moderately synthetic. There are two subtypes of synthesis, according to whether morphemes are clearly differentiable or not. These subtypes are agglutinative and fusional (or inflectional or flectional in older terminology). ===Fusional languages=== Polish, noun declension collapses several factors into one ending: number (only plural is shown), gender, animacy, and case. Morphemes in fusional languages are not readily distinguishable from the root or among themselves. Several grammatical bits of meaning may be fused into one affix. Morphemes may also be expressed by internal phonological changes in the root (i.e. morphophonology), such as consonant gradation and vowel gradation, or by suprasegmental features such as stress or tone, which are of course inseparable from the root. The Indo-European and Semitic languages are the most typically cited examples of fusional languages. However, others have been described. For example, Navajo is sometimes categorized as a fusional language because its complex system of verbal affixes has become condensed and irregular enough that discerning individual morphemes is rarely possible. Some Uralic languages are described as fusional, particularly the Sami languages and Estonian. On the other hand, not all Indo-European languages are fusional; for example, Armenian and Persian are agglutinative, while English and Afrikaans lean more analytic. ===Agglutinative languages=== Chechen, an agglutinative language. Agglutinative languages have words containing several morphemes that are always clearly differentiable from one another in that each morpheme represents only one grammatical meaning and the boundaries between those morphemes are easily demarcated; that is, the bound morphemes are affixes, and they may be individually identified. Agglutinative languages tend to have a high number of morphemes per word, and their morphology is usually highly regular, with a notable exception being Georgian, among others. Agglutinative languages include Finnish, Hungarian, Turkish, Mongolian, Korean, Japanese, and Indonesian. ===Polysynthetic languages=== In 1836, Wilhelm von Humboldt proposed a third category for classifying languages, a category that he labeled polysynthetic. (The term polysynthesis was first used in linguistics by Peter Stephen DuPonceau who borrowed it from chemistry.) These languages have a high morpheme-to-word ratio, a highly regular morphology, and a tendency for verb forms to include morphemes that refer to several arguments besides the subject (polypersonalism). Another feature of polysynthetic languages is commonly expressed as \\"the ability to form words that are equivalent to whole sentences in other languages\\". The distinction between synthetic languages and polysynthetic languages is therefore relative: the place of one language largely depends on its relation to other languages displaying similar characteristics on the same scale. Many Amerindian languages are polysynthetic; indeed, most of the world's polysynthetic languages are native to North America. Inuktitut is one example, for instance the word-phrase: tavvakiqutiqarpiit roughly translates to \\"Do you have any tobacco for sale?\\". However, it is a common misconception that polysynthetic morphology is universal among Amerindian languages. Chinook and Shoshone, for instance, are simply agglutinative, as their nouns stand mostly separate from their verbs. ===Oligosynthetic languages=== Oligosynthetic languages are ones in which very few morphemes, perhaps only a few hundred, combine as in polysynthetic languages. Benjamin Whorf categorized Nahuatl and Blackfoot as oligosynthetic, but most linguists disagree with this classification and instead label them polysynthetic or simply agglutinative. No known languages are widely accepted as oligosynthetic. ==In constructed languages== The rigidly defined, analytic words of Lojban make the language useful for describing logic ‚Äì in this case, discrete mathematics. Constructed languages (conlangs) take a variety of morphological alignments. Most universal auxiliary languages based on the Indo-European family take on the family's typical fusional alignment, such as Ido, Novial and Interlingua. A notable exception, however, is Volap√ºk, which is strongly agglutinative. Another exception is Esperanto, which tends to be agglutinative as well. Zonal constructed languages such as Interslavic tend to follow the language families they are based on. Fictional languages vary: among J. R. R. Tolkien's languages for the Middle-earth universe, for example, Sindarin is fusional while Quenya is agglutinative. The language Newspeak from 1984 is a variant of English derived from the very concept of agglutination. Among engineered languages, Toki Pona is completely analytic, as it contains only a limited set of words with no inflections or compounds. Lojban is analytic to the extent that every gismu (basic word, not counting particles) involves pre-determined syntactical roles for every gismu coming after it in a clause, though it does involve agglutination of roots when forming calques. Ithkuil, on the other hand, contains both agglutination in its addition of affixes and extreme fusion in that these affixes often result from the fusion of numerous morphemes via ablaut. ==Interconnectedness== While the above scheme of analytic, fusional, and agglutinative languages dominated linguistics for many years‚Äîat least since the 1920s‚Äîit has fallen out of favor more recently. A common objection has been that most languages display features of all three types, if not in equal measure, some of them contending that a fully fusional language would be completely suppletive. Jennifer Garland of the University of California, Santa Barbara gives Sinhala as an example of a language that demonstrates the flaws in the traditional scheme: she argues that while its affixes, clitics, and postpositions would normally be considered markers of agglutination, they are too closely intertwined to the root, yet classifying the language as primarily fusional, as it usually is, is also unsatisfying. ===Cyclical evolution=== A clock face has been used as a metaphor for the evolution amongst analytic, agglutinative and fusional states R. M. W. Dixon (1998) theorizes that languages normally evolve in a cycle from fusional to analytic to agglutinative to fusional again. He analogizes this cycle to a clock, placing fusional languages at 12:00, analytic languages at 4:00, and agglutinative languages at 8:00. Dixon suggests that, for example, Old Chinese was at about 3:00 (mostly analytic with some fusional elements), while modern varieties are around 5:00 (leaning instead toward agglutination), and also guesses that Proto-Tai-Kadai may have been fusional. On the other hand, he argues that modern Finno-Ugric and Dravidian languages are on the transition from agglutinative to fusional, with the Finno-Ugric family being further along. Dixon cites the Egyptian language as one that has undergone the entire cycle in three thousand years. Other linguists have proposed similar concepts. For instance, van Gelderen sees the regular patterns of linguistic change as a cycle. In the unidirectional cycles, older features are replaced by newer items. One example is grammaticalisation, where a lexical item became a grammatical marker. The markers may further grammaticalise, and a new marker may come in place to substitute the loss of meaning of the previous marker.van Gelderen, Elly. (2011). The Linguistic Cycle: Language Change and the Language Faculty. New York, NY: Oxford University Press.van Gelderen, Elly. (2013). The Linguistic Cycle and the Language Faculty. Language and Linguistics Compass, 7(4), 233‚Äì250. ===WALS=== The World Atlas of Language Structures (WALS) sees the categorization of languages as strictly analytic, agglutinative, or fusional as misleading, arguing that these categories conflate multiple variables. WALS lists these variables as: *Phonological fusion ‚Äì how intrinsically connected grammatical markers are phonologically to their host words *Formative exponence ‚Äì the number of categories expressed in a single marker (e.g. tense + number + gender for verbs in some languages) *Flexivity ‚Äì allomorphy and inflectional classes such as possessive classification These categories give rise to highly non-traditional distributions of typological traits. For example, high exponence for nouns (e.g. case + number) is typically thought of as a trait of fusional languages. However, it is absent in many traditionally fusional languages like French, Spanish, and Arabic but present in many traditionally agglutinative languages like Finnish, Yaqui, and Cree. ==References== ==External links== * , chapter 9 of Halvor Eifring & Rolf Theil: Linguistics for Students of Asian and African Languages * The book Language: An Introduction to the Study of Speech by Edward Sapir (1921) contains a classic introduction to the subject. * Japanese Morphological Analysis API Japanese Morphological Analysis API by NTT Resonant typology ","title":"Morphological typology"},{"id":"525185","text":"Lincoln Hall may refer to one of the following: ==People== * Lincoln Hall (climber) (1955 ‚Äì 2012), Australian mountain climber and author ==PlacesEngland=== *Lincoln Hall, one of the University of Nottingham Halls of Residence in Nottingham, England. *Lincoln Hall, a student residence at Lincoln College, Oxford in Oxford, England. *Lincoln Hall, a student residence at Wymondham College in Norfolk, England. === United States === * Lincoln Hall, a classroom building at Danville Area Community College in Danville, Illinois. * Lincoln Hall, a middle school in the Lincolnwood School District 74 in Lincolnwood, Illinois. * Lincoln Hall (University of Illinois) in Urbana, Illinois, United States. * Lincoln Hall, Berea College, a National Historic Landmark at Berea College, Berea, Kentucky. * Lincoln Hall, a classroom building at Ozarks Technical Community College in Springfield, Missouri. * Lincoln Hall, a classroom building at Cornell University College of Arts and Sciences in Ithaca, New York. * Lincoln Hall, a student residence at Bluffton University in Bluffton, Ohio. * Lincoln Hall, a student residence at the University of Nevada, Reno in Reno, Nevada. * Lincoln Hall, a former high school and current performing arts building at Portland State University in Portland, Oregon. * Lincoln Hall, a concert hall in Chicago, Illinois.

Words spelled with silent letters (e.g. island, knife), or traditionally pronounced with reduced vowels or omitted consonants (e.g. cupboard, Worcester), may be subject to a spelling pronunciation. If a word's spelling was standardized prior to sound changes that produced its \\"traditional\\" pronunciation, a spelling pronunciation may reflect an even older pronunciation. This is often the case with compound words (e.g. waistcoat, cupboard, forehead). It is also the case for many words with silent letters (e.g. oftenoften in the American Heritage Dictionary), though not all‚Äîsilent letters are sometimes added for etymological reasons, to reflect a word's spelling in its language of origin (e.g. victual, rhyming with littlevictuals in the Merriam-Webster Dictionaryvictual in Oxford Dictionaries but derived from Late Latin victualia). Some silent letters were added on the basis of erroneous etymologies, as in the cases of the words islandisland in the American Heritage Dictionary and scythe. Spelling pronunciations are often prescriptively discouraged and perceived as incorrect next to the traditionally accepted, and usually more widespread, pronunciation. If a spelling pronunciation persists and becomes more common, it may eventually join the existing form as a standard variant (for example waistcoat and often), or even become the dominant pronunciation (as with forehead and falcon). ==Prevalence and causes== A large number of easily noticeable spelling pronunciations occurs only in languages such as French and English in which spelling tends to not indicate the current pronunciation. Because all languages have at least some words which are not spelled as pronounced, even those such as Finnish with most words being written phonetically, spelling pronunciations can arise in any language in which most people obtain only enough education to learn how to read and write but not enough to understand when the spelling fails to indicate the modern pronunciation. In other words, when many people do not clearly understand the relationship between spelling and pronunciation, spelling pronunciations are common. On the other hand, spelling pronunciations are also evidence of the reciprocal effects of spoken and written language on each other.Michael Stubbs, Language and Literacy: the Sociolinguistics of Reading and Writing. London: Routledge & Kegan Paul, p. 31-32 Many spellings represent older forms and corresponding older pronunciations. Some spellings, however, are not etymologically correct. Though many people may believe (to various degrees of accuracy) that the written language is \\"more correct\\", that, in turn, can become a self- fulfilling prophecy, with the written language affecting and changing the spoken language and resulting in a pronunciation that is similar to an older pronunciation or even to a new pronunciation that is suggested by the spelling but had never occurred before. ==Examples of English words with common spelling pronunciations== * kiln with a fully pronounced \\"n\\" (rather than a silent \\"n\\") is a reversion to an older pronunciation, only accepted as standard since the early 20th century.

Today, spelling pronunciation has shifted the word's pronunciation predominantly to . ==Opinions== Spelling pronunciations give rise to varied opinions. Often, those who retain the old pronunciation consider the spelling pronunciation to be a mark of ignorance or insecurity. Those who use a spelling pronunciation may not be aware that it is one and consider the historically-authentic version to be slovenly since it \\"slurs over\\" a letter. Conversely, the users of some innovative pronunciations such as \\"Febuary\\" (for February) may regard the historically- and phonetically- authentic version to be a pedantic spelling pronunciation. Henry Watson Fowler (1858‚Äì1933) reports that in his day, there was a conscious movement among schoolteachers and others encouraging people to abandon anomalous traditional pronunciations and to \\"speak as you spell\\". According to major scholars of early modern English (Dobson, Wyld et al.), in the 17th century, there was already beginning an \\"intellectual\\" trend in England to \\"pronounce as you spell\\". That presupposes a standard spelling system, which was only beginning to form at the time. Similarly, quite a large number of \\"corrections\\" slowly spread from scholars to the general public in France, starting several centuries ago.Peter Rickard, A History of the French Language: 1989 A different variety of spelling pronunciations are phonetic adaptations, pronunciations of the written form of foreign words within the frame of the phonemic system of the language that accepts them: an example of this process is garage ( in French) sometimes pronounced in English. Such adaptations are quite natural and often preferred by speech-conscious and careful speakers. ==Children and foreigners== Children who read a great deal often have spelling pronunciations because if they do not consult a dictionary, they have only the spelling to indicate the pronunciation of words that are uncommon in the spoken language. Well-read second language learners may also have spelling pronunciations. In some instances, a population in a formerly non-English speaking area may retain such second language markers in the now native- English speaking population. For example, Scottish Standard English is replete with spelling pronunciations from when Scots was subsumed by English in the 17th century. However, since there are many words that one reads far more often than one hears, adult native-language speakers are also affected. In such circumstances, the \\"spelling pronunciation\\" may well be more comprehensible than any other. That, in turn, leads to the language evolution mentioned above. What is a spelling pronunciation in one generation often becomes the standard pronunciation in the next. ==In other languages== In French, the modern pronunciation of the 16th-century French author Montaigne as , rather than the contemporary , is a spelling pronunciation. When English club was first borrowed into French, the approved pronunciation was , as being a reasonable approximation of the English. The standard then became on the basis of the spelling, and later, in Europe, , deemed closer to the English original. The standard pronunciation in Quebec French remains . Similarly, shampooing \\"product for washing the hair\\" at the time of borrowing was but it is now In Modern Hebrew, the word ◊ó÷µ◊ò÷∞◊ê (, meaning 'sin') is sometimes pronounced , as suggested by its spelling, especially by children. Other examples of spelling pronunciations are the Sephardic Hebrew ◊õ÷∏÷º◊ú (, meaning all) being pronounced as and ◊¶÷∏◊î÷≥◊®÷∑◊ô÷¥◊ù (, meaning noon) being pronounced as because of how the kamatz katan vowel point (◊ê÷∏), which indicates , is visually identical to the kamatz, which indicates . In Italian, a few early English loanwords are pronounced according to Italian spelling rules such as water ('toilet bowl', from English water (closet)), pronounced , and tramway, pronounced . The Italian word ovest ('west') comes from a spelling pronunciation of French ouest (which, in turn, is a phonetic transcription of English west); that particular instance of spelling pronunciation must have occurred before the 16th century, when the letters u and v were still indistinct. A few foreign proper names are normally pronounced according to the pronunciation of the original language (or a close approximation of it), but they retain an older spelling pronunciation when they are used as parts of Italian street names. For exame, the name of Edward Jenner retains its usual English pronunciation in most contexts, but Viale Edoardo Jenner (a main street in Milan) is pronounced . The use of such old-fashioned spelling pronunciations was probably encouraged by the custom of translating given names when streets were named after foreign people: Edoardo for Edward, or Giorgio for George for Via Giorgio Washington. In Spanish, the \\"ch\\" in some German words is pronounced or ,instead of . Bach is pronounced , and Kuchen is , but Rorschach is , rather than , Mach is or , and Kirchner is or . Other spelling pronunciations are club pronounced , iceberg pronounced in Spain (in the Americas, it is pronounced ), and folclor and folclore as translations of folklore, pronounced and . Also in Spanish, the acute accent in the French word √©lite is taken as a Spanish stress mark, and the word is pronounced . When Slavic languages like Polish or Czech borrow words from English with their spelling preserved, the pronunciation tends to follow the rules of Polish. Words such as \\"marketing\\" are pronounced as spelled, instead of the more faithful \\"markytyng\\". In Vietnamese, initial \\"v\\" is often pronounced like a \\"y\\" () in the central and southern varieties. However, in formal speech, speakers often revert to the spelling pronunciation, which is increasingly being used in casual speech as well. ==See also== * Folk etymology * Heterography * Hypercorrection * Hyperforeignism * Orthography * Spelling reform * Padonkaffsky jargon ==References== ==Sources== * See the index entries under \\"spelling pronunciation\\" from Leonard Bloomfield, Language (originally published 1933; current edition 1984, University of Chicago Press, Chicago; ). * Most of the etymologies and spelling histories above are taken from the Oxford English Dictionary. * Neuman, Yishai.

During his administration at NASA, the first manned lunar landing by Apollo 11 was flown as were three other Apollo missions. Paine was also deeply involved in preparing plans for the post-Apollo era at NASA. ==Early life and education== Born in Berkeley, California, Paine attended public schools in various cities and graduated from Brown University in 1942 with an A.B. degree in engineering. At Brown, Paine joined Delta Kappa Epsilon Fraternity. In World War II, he served as a submarine officer in the Pacific and in the subsequent Japanese occupation. In late 1945, Paine became the executive officer of the prize crew which sailed the Japanese aircraft-carrying submarine I-400 from Japan to Pearl Harbor. He qualified as a Navy deep-sea diver and was awarded the Commendation Medal and Submarine Combat Insignia with stars. From 1946‚Äì1949, Paine attended Stanford University, receiving an M.S. degree in 1947 and Ph.D. degree in 1949 in physical metallurgy. During his career, Paine received honorary doctor of science degrees from Brown, Clarkson College of Technology, Nebraska Wesleyan University, the University of New Brunswick, Oklahoma City University, and an honorary doctor of engineering degree from Worcester Polytechnic Institute. ==CareerResearch scientist=== Stanford University Paine began his career as a research associate at Stanford University from 1947 to 1949, where he made basic studies of high- temperature alloys and liquid metals in support of naval nuclear reactor programs. General Electric Paine joined the General Electric Research Laboratory in Schenectady, New York, in 1949 as a research associate, where he started research programs on magnetic and composite materials. In 1951, Paine transferred to the Meter and Instrument Department of G.E. in Lynn, Massachusetts, as the manager of materials development, and later as a laboratory manager. Under Dr. Paine's management, this lab received the Award for Outstanding Contribution to Industrial Science in 1956 from the American Association for the Advancement of Science for its work in fine-particle magnet development. From 1958 through 1962, Dr. Paine was a research associate and manager of Engineering Applications at the Research and Development Center of the General Electric Company in Schenectady, N.Y., From 1963 to 1968, Paine was manager of TEMPO, the Center for Advanced Studies of General Electric located in Santa Barbara, California. ===NASA Administrator=== Dr. Paine was appointed Deputy Administrator of NASA on January 31, 1968. Upon the retirement of James E. Webb on October 8, 1968, he was named Acting Administrator of NASA. He was nominated as NASA's third Administrator on March 5, 1969, and confirmed by the Senate on March 20, 1969. Paine was recruited to succeed Webb by President Lyndon Johnson. He was tasked with the responsibility of getting the Apollo program back on track in the wake of the Apollo 1 disaster, and fulfilling President Kennedy's goal \\"before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth.\\" During his administration at NASA, the first seven Apollo manned missions were flown, highlighted by the first manned lunar landing by Apollo 11. In all, 20 astronauts orbited Earth, 24 traveled to the Moon, and twelve walked upon its surface. Many automated scientific and applications spacecraft were also flown in U.S. and cooperative international programs. Paine was also deeply involved in preparing plans for the post-Apollo era at NASA. Along with George Mueller and others, Paine developed an ambitious plan calling for the establishment of a lunar base and a massive space station in Earth orbit before the end of the 1970s, culminating in a manned mission to Mars as early as 1981. President Richard Nixon rejected these plans, however. He was awarded the NASA Distinguished Service Medal. Apollo 11 Goodwill Messages Paine was instrumental in acquiring the sentiments of world leaders that became the Apollo 11 Goodwill Messages which now rests on the lunar surface. He personally corresponded with the heads of what became seventy-three participating nations, and coordinated the efforts to enshrine their messages on a tiny silicon disc manufactured by the Sprague Electric Company of North Adams, Massachusetts. Paine's name is also etched onto the disc. Paine proposed the idea of the messages to the State Department's Under Secretary for Political Affairs U. Alexis Johnson. A high level committee determined that a plaque declaring that \\"We Came in Peace for all Mankind\\" and the planting of a U.S. flag on the Moon were to be part of the ceremonial activities for Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on the lunar surface. ===Post- NASA=== General Electric Paine resigned from NASA September 15, 1970, to return to the General Electric Co. in New York City as Vice President and Group Executive, Power Generation Group, (worldwide ship propulsion, nuclear power and steam and gas turbine generators), and later became Senior Vice President for Science and Technology (oversight of GE's research and development). Northrop corporation Paine left GE in 1976 to become the President and Chief Operating Officer of Northrop Corporation, where he also served as a Director. Paine retired as President of Northrop in 1982. National Commission on Space flag of Mars in 1984 On October 12, 1984, President Ronald Reagan issued Executive Order 12490 that commissioned a panel of experts to investigate and evaluate the future of the national space program. President Ronald Reagan appointed Dr. Paine to be the chairman of this investigation. Rather than naming the commission after himself, as is customary, he chose instead to name it The National Commission on Space. Members of the 15-member commission included Dr. Luis Alvarez (a winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics), Neil Armstrong (NASA astronaut and the first man on the Moon), Dr. Gerard K. O'Neill (American physicist and space activist), Dr. Kathryn D. Sullivan (Space Shuttle astronaut and first American woman to walk in space), Dr. Jeane Kirkpatrick (political scientist and former United States Ambassador to the United Nations) and Brigadier General Charles E. \\"Chuck\\" Yeager (rocket plane pilot and first man to break the sound barrier). Since leaving NASA fifteen years earlier, Dr. Paine had been a vocal spokesman for an expansive future of Space exploration. The National Commission on Space took most of a year to prepare its report, conducting public hearings throughout the United States. The Commission report, Pioneering the Space Frontier, was published in May 1986. It espoused \\"a pioneering mission for 21st-century America... to lead the exploration and development of the space frontier, advancing science, technology, and enterprise, and building institutions and systems that make accessible vast new resources and support human settlements beyond Earth orbit, from the highlands of the Moon to the plains of Mars.\\" The report also contained a \\"Declaration for Space\\" that included a rationale for exploring and settling the solar system and outlined a long-range space program for the United States. Thomas O. Paine Associates In 1982, Paine established Thomas Paine Associates - High Technology Enterprises (TPA) in Westwood, CA, and relocated it in Santa Monica, CA, in 1986. TPA also housed Paine's 3400-volume Submarine Warfare Library, which was later donated to the Nimitz Library, U.S. Naval Academy. Corporate directorships Dr. Paine served as a director for many corporations, including the RCA, NBC, Eastern Air Lines, Nike, Arthur D. Little, Inc., Orbital Sciences, and Quotron Systems (a division of the Citicorp company). Paine also served as a Director of the Planetary Society, the National Space Institute, the International Academy of Astronautics, and the Pacific Forum CSIS Honolulu Hawaii. The Planetary Society honored his commitment to Mars by establishing The Thomas O. Paine Award for the Advancement of Human Exploration of Mars. University trustee Paine also served as a Trustee of Occidental College and Brown University and was a member of the National Academy of Engineering. ==Personal life== Paine was married to Barbara Helen Taunton Pearse of Perth, Australia. They had four children: Marguerite Ada, George Thomas, Judith Janet, and Frank Taunton. Paine died of cancer at his home in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles, California in May 1992. In 1972, Paine donated his papers to the Library of Congress where they are currently open and available in the Manuscript Division. Although there is one container of classified material, the other 183 are open and available to researchers. ==In media== In the 1966 BBC TV PANORAMA documentary California 2000, Paine is interviewed and offers predictions on how technology will impact society. In the 1995 movie Apollo 13, Paine is played by Joe Spano. In the 1996 TV movie Apollo 11, he is played by Carmen Argenziano. In the 1998 TV miniseries From the Earth to the Moon, he is played by Sam Anderson. In the 2019 web television series For All Mankind he is played by Dan Donohue. ==References== *Portions of this article are based on public domain text from NASA. * * Category:Brown University School of Engineering alumni Category:Administrators of NASA Category:Deputy Administrators of NASA Category:1921 births Category:1992 deaths Category:Deaths from cancer in California Category:People from Berkeley, California Category:Stanford University alumni ","title":"Thomas O.

After rising in Wyoming County, the stream flows through Genesee County before forming part of the boundary between Erie County and Niagara County. ==Description== The length of Tonawanda Creek is . Its drainage basin is nearly in area. It flows on a meandering course for most of its length, first northerly until reaching the City of Batavia where a sweeping bend takes it westerly. Tonawanda Creek rises in Wyoming County and enters the Niagara River between Niagara County and Erie County, forming a boundary between them. Tonawanda Creek passes through the Village of Attica, the City of Batavia, flows between the City of North Tonawanda to its north and the Town of Amherst to its south, the Town of Clarence, the Town of Tonawanda, and the City of Tonawanda. Just after being joined by Ellicott Creek, it enters the Niagara River. The creek has a small waterfall at Indian Falls where the stream descends from the Onondaga Escarpment. During the spring of each year, some sections of Tonawanda Creek flood to varying degrees. These floods are more of an inconvenience than a danger, but can be more serious, especially when ice jams dam up the water. The larger flooding can cause property damage. Tonawanda Creek is also part of the Erie Canal, which joins the creek southwest of Lockport and allows canal traffic to proceed into the Niagara River. In its upper reaches, Tonawanda Creek and the Little Tonawanda, which is a tributary, are trout streams. ==History== The name Tonawanda (') or (') derives from the Iroquois (Haudenosaunee) language meaning swift water. Tonawanda Creek flows through the ancient lake bed of Glacial Lake Tonawanda, a prehistoric lake that existed approximately 10,000 years ago at the end of the last ice age; many of the swamp lands surrounding Tonawanda Creek also date back to this lake. Downstream of Indian Falls, Tonawanda Creek flows through the Tonawanda Indian Reservation, and there is a NYS historical marker where George Washington made a troop fording across the stream.

Under the Treaty of Amsterdam, member states agreed to transfer certain powers from national governments to the European Parliament across diverse areas, including legislating on immigration, adopting civil and criminal laws, and enacting foreign and security policy (CFSP), as well as implementing institutional changes for expansion as new member nations join the EU. ==Background== The treaty was the result of long negotiations which began in Messina, Italy, on 2 June 1995, nearly forty years after the signing of the Treaty of Rome, and reached completion in Amsterdam on 18 June 1997. Following the formal signing of the Treaty on 2 October 1997, the Member States engaged in an equally long and complex ratification process. The European Parliament endorsed the treaty on 19 November 1997, and after two referendums and 13 decisions by parliaments, the Member States finally concluded the procedure. ==Contents== The treaty of Amsterdam comprises 13 Protocols, 51 Declarations adopted by the Conference, and 8 Declarations by Member States, plus amendments to the existing Treaties set out in 15 Articles. Article 1 (containing 16 paragraphs) amends the general provisions of the Treaty on European Union and covers the CFSP and cooperation in criminal and police matters. The next four Articles (70 paragraphs) amend the EC Treaty, the European Coal and Steel Community Treaty (which expired in 2002), the Euratom Treaty, and the Act concerning the election of the European Parliament. The final provisions contain four Articles. The new Treaty also set out to simplify the Community Treaties, deleting more than 56 obsolete articles and renumbering the rest in order to make the whole more legible. By way of example, Article 189b on the codecision procedure became Article 251. The most pressing concerns of ordinary Europeans, such as their legal and personal security, immigration, and fraud prevention, were all dealt with in other chapters of the Treaty. In particular, the EU became responsible for legislating on immigration, civil law or civil procedure, insofar as this is necessary for the free movement of persons within the EU. At the same time, intergovernmental co-operation was intensified in the police and criminal justice field so that Member States should be able to coordinate their activities more effectively. The Union aims to establish an area of freedom, security and justice for its citizens. The Schengen Agreements have now been incorporated into the legal system of the EU (Ireland and the United Kingdom remained outside the Schengen agreement, see Common Travel Area for details). The Treaty lays down new principles and responsibilities in the field of the common foreign and security policy, with the emphasis on projecting the EU's values to the outside world, protecting its interests, and reforming its modes of action. The European Council will lay down common strategies, which will then be put into effect by the Council acting by a qualified majority, subject to certain conditions. In other cases, some Member States may choose to abstain \\"constructively\\", i.e. without actually preventing actions being taken. The treaty introduced a High Representative for EU Foreign Policy who, together with the Presidents of the Council and the European Commission, puts a \\"name and a face\\" on EU policy to the outside world. Although the Amsterdam Treaty did not provide for a common defence, it did increase the EU's responsibilities for peacekeeping and humanitarian work, in particular by forging closer links with Western European Union. === Institutions === As for the institutions, there were two major reforms concerning the co-decision procedure (the legislative procedure involving the European Parliament and the Council), affecting its scope--most legislation was adopted by the co-decision procedure--and its detailed procedures, with Parliament playing a much stronger role. The President of the Commission will also have to earn the personal trust of Parliament, which will give him the authority to lay down the Commission's policy guidelines and play an active part in choosing the Members of the Commission by deciding on their appointment by common accord with the national governments. These provisions make the Commission more politically accountable, particularly vis-√†-vis the European Parliament. Finally, the new Treaty enables, under very strict conditions, closer co-operation between Member States which so wish. Closer co-operation may be established, on a proposal from the Commission, in cases where it is not possible to take joint action, provided that such steps do not undermine the coherence of the EU or the rights and equality of its citizens. ==Challenges== The Amsterdam Treaty did not settle all institutional questions. Work was still in progress on reforming the institutions to make them capable of operating effectively and democratically in a much enlarged EU. The most pressing issues were the composition of the Commission and the weighting of Member States' votes upon qualified majority voting. These questions were addressed in the Treaty of Lisbon. == Signatures == { width=100% style=\\"margin:0em 0em 0em 0em; font-size:.95em; border:1px solid #CCCCCC; background:#FFFFFF; vertical-align:top;\\" -  align=\\"center\\" height=\\"85px\\"  100px  align=\\"center\\"  100px  align=\\"center\\"  100px  align=\\"center\\"  100px  align=\\"center\\"  100px  align=\\"center\\"  100px  align=\\"center\\"  100px  align=\\"center\\"  100px  align=\\"center\\"  100px -          -  align=\\"center\\" height=\\"85px\\"  100px  align=\\"center\\"  100px  align=\\"center\\"  100px  align=\\"center\\"  100px  align=\\"center\\"  100px  align=\\"center\\"  100px  align=\\"center\\"   align=\\"center\\"   align=\\"center\\"  -          - } ===Withdrawal=== On 31 January 2020, the United Kingdom left the European Union and so withdrew from the treaty. == EU evolution timeline == ==See also== *Common Travel Area *Enhanced cooperation *Schengen Treaty ==References== ==External links== * The Amsterdam Treaty - official site * The Amsterdam treaty: a comprehensive guide * Full text of the Amsterdam Treaty * The Treaty on European Union (as amended by the Treaty of Amsterdam - pdf 203Kb) * The Treaty establishing the European Community (as amended by the Treaty of Amsterdam - pdf 488Kb) * The History of the European Union - The Treaty of Amsterdam * European Disability Forum: Guide to the Amsterdam Treaty (Single page) * The Amsterdam Summit in retrospect: Maastricht II and corporate lobby successes (UNICE) * The Amsterdam Treaty - How Industry Got Its Way(ERT) * Amsterdam Treaty European NAvigator Amsterdam Category:Treaties concluded in 1997 Category:Treaties entered into force in 1999 Category:1997 in the European Union Category:1999 in the European Union ","title":"Treaty of Amsterdam"},{"id":"525212","text":"In the sport of cricket, a bouncer (or bumper) is a type of short-pitched delivery, usually bowled by a fast bowler, which bounces once and then reaches the batsman at head-height. ==Usage== Bouncers are used to drive the batsman back on to his back foot if he has been freely playing front foot scoring shots, such as drives. To this end, bouncers are usually directed more or less at the line of the batsman's body. Aiming at the batsman is legal provided the ball bounces on the pitch; or upon reaching the batsman, the ball is below the batsman's waist. Aiming at the batsman's head without bouncing on the pitch, known as a beamer, is illegal. hook shot against a bouncer. A batsman may play a bouncer in either a defensive or an attacking way. If the batsman plays it defensively he aims primarily to avoid getting out, and secondarily to avoid being hit by the ball. For a head-high bouncer, these goals are achieved most easily by ducking under the ball. If the ball is at chest height, the batsman's best defence is to move on to his back foot, raise his bat vertically to chest height, and attempt to block the ball and direct it downwards to the pitch so as to avoid presenting a catch to a fielder. Sometimes the batsman will need to jump into the air to gain the necessary height to defend with the bat. He may also sway out of the way. Given these approaches, the bowler can hope to both intimidate the batsman somewhat, and possibly have the ball deflect off the bat at an awkward angle and produce a catch for a nearby fielder. Bouncer in purple. Conversely, the bouncer can be a very productive ball for the batsman, if he plays it in an attacking manner. The shot that is used to attack the bouncer is the hook shot. To play the hook shot the batsman moves his back foot backwards and towards the off side as the ball is being delivered. As the ball approaches, the batsman swivels from facing the off side to facing the leg side, while holding the bat horizontally. The batsman's aim is to hit the ball at high speed towards, into or over the leg side boundary. However, despite their run-scoring potential, hook shots frequently lead to wickets falling, particularly through balls hitting the top edge of the bat and being caught by leg side fielders. However, if the bouncer is misdirected by the bowler, and reaches the batsman on the off side of his wicket, the cut, uppercut or late cut can be played, either with the intention of guiding the ball along the ground, through a gap in the field setting, or over the infield for four or six. There is an unspoken agreement, particularly in the time before the widespread use of batting helmets, that fast bowlers will not bowl bouncers at each other, because less skilled batsmen are less likely to effectively defend and therefore more likely to be struck. Breaking of this rule can lead to \\"bouncer wars\\" ‚Äì that is, the targeted bowler engaging in retaliatory hostile short- pitched bowling at his opponent during the following innings. ==ICC rules== Because of the potential danger to batsmen of being hit and to stop bowlers bowling bouncers all the time, there are Laws in the Laws of Cricket governing how frequently a bowler may bowl bouncers, as well as how many fielders may field backward of square leg. These laws take into account the relative skill of the batsmen. During the 1970s to 1980s, bouncers were used as part of a team's intimidatory tactics, especially by the West Indies team. In 1991, the International Cricket Council (ICC) introduced a \\"one bouncer per batsman per over\\" rule in an attempt to discourage use of intimidation. However, the ruling was not well received by players and umpires alike, with English umpire Dickie Bird describing it as \\"farcical\\" as he felt that calling intimidatory tactics should be left to the umpire. The ICC changed it to two bouncers per over in 1994, with a two-run no-ball penalty (rather than one-run no-ball) if the bowler exceeded two bouncers an over. One Day International cricket allowed one bouncer per over in 2001 (and a one-run no-ball in case a bowler exceeded the limit). On 29 October 2012 the ICC increased the number of bouncers that could be bowled during a One Day International to two per over. The number of bouncers per over allowed in T20s was kept to one. ==Controversies== Fast leg theory, the deliberate and sustained bowling of bouncers aimed at the body, coupled with a cordon of legside catching fieldsmen to catch deflections, was a tactic used by England against Australia in 1932/33, dubbed the Bodyline series by the Australians. This controversial tactic caused the Laws of Cricket to be reformed to prevent any recurrence. In 1954‚Äì55 in Sydney, England fast bowler Frank Tyson bowled bouncers at Australian Ray Lindwall, who returned the favour by hospitalising Tyson with one of his own. An angry Tyson returned with a large lump on his head and took 6/85 in the second innings to give England a 38-run victory. In 1994 at the Oval Devon Malcolm was hit on the helmet by a bouncer from Fanie de Villiers. The incensed Malcolm told the South Africans \\"You guys are history\\" and took apart their second innings with 9/57. ==Injuries and deaths caused by bouncers== Justin Langer spent time in hospital in 2006 after being struck in the head by a bouncer The bouncer is an aggressive delivery and the very nature of the delivery by a fast bowler and aimed at the head can lead to batsmen being hit in the chest, neck or head. In 1962, Indian captain Nari Contractor was hit above his right ear by a Charlie Griffith bouncer which resulted in severe loss of blood and left Contractor critically ill. He regained full consciousness after six days and returned to first-class cricket ten months later. In 2006, playing in his 100th test, Australian opener Justin Langer was struck on the head by a bouncer from Makhaya Ntini and hospitalised. In 2008 West Indies batsman Shivnarine Chanderpaul was knocked out for several minutes after being hit by a bouncer from Australian fast bowler Brett Lee during a test match. Shoaib Akhtar injured both Gary Kirsten (2003) and Brian Lara (2004) with fast bouncers. Both batsmen had to be taken off the field. In November 2014, Australian cricketer Phillip Hughes was knocked unconscious by a bouncer from Sean Abbott, which hit the side of his head, between the grille and shell of his helmet, during a Sheffield Shield match. He was taken to hospital in a critical condition, suffering from a subarachnoid haemorrhage, but died from his injuries two days later, never having regained consciousness. During the semifinal of the 2019 Cricket World Cup, against England, Alex Carey injured his chin from a deadly bouncer of Jofra Archer. During the second test of the 2019 Ashes Series, Australian batsman Steve Smith was hit on the neck by a 92.4mph(148.7 Kmph) delivery from England fast bowler Jofra Archer. After retiring concussed, Smith returned to play 45 minutes later. The Australian medical team's decision to let him play was criticised by the brain injury charity Headway, as \\"incredibly dangerous\\". Smith's replacement, Marnus Labuschagne, became the first concussion substitute in a Test match. ==See also== *Cricket terminology ==References== Category:Cricket captaincy and tactics Category:Bowling (cricket) Category:Cricket terminology fr:Lexique du cricket#B ","title":"Bouncer (cricket)"},{"id":"525215","text":"traditional Shamoji Shamoji and a table spoon for size comparison in the Buddhist temple (Kumamoto, Japan) A shamoji (ÊùìÊñáÂ≠ó, „Åó„ÇÉ„ÇÇ„Åò) or rice paddle is a large flat spoon used in East Asian cuisine.

This big- game fish was caught near Cabo San Lucas, on the Pacific coast of Mexico. Big- game fishing, also known as offshore sportfishing, offshore gamefishing, or blue-water fishing is a form of recreational fishing, targeting large fish such as tuna and marlin which game fisherman regard as having \\"sporting qualities\\". ==History== Big-game fishing started as a sport after the invention of the motor boat. Charles Frederick Holder, a marine biologist and early conservationist, is credited with founding the sport in 1898. He went on to publish many articles and books on the subject, noted for their combination of accurate scientific detail with exciting narratives.The history of game fishing Purpose built game fishing boats appeared early in the 20th century. An example is the Crete, in use at Catalina Island, California, in 1915, and shipped to Hawaii the following year. According to a newspaper report at that time, the Crete had \\"... a deep cockpit, a chair fitted for landing big fish and leather pockets for placing the pole.\\"First game fishing boat arrives in Hawaii Honolulu Star-Bulletin, 13 March 1916 ==Big-game species== The billfish (broadbill swordfish, marlin and sailfish), larger tunas (bluefin, yellowfin, and bigeye) and sharks (mako, great white, tiger, hammerhead and other large species) are the main species recognized as big-game fish, with many anglers considering the Atlantic tarpon also a big-game species. Smaller game fish, such as dolphinfish, wahoo, smaller tuna species such as albacore and skipjack tuna, plus barracuda, are commonly caught as by-catch or taken deliberately for use as live or dead bait. ==Locations== Historically most of the locations where the sport was developed, such as Avalon, California; Florida; Bimini in the Bahamas; Cairns, Queensland, Australia; northern New Zealand; Panama; Wedgeport in Nova Scotia and Kona in Hawaii, benefited from the presence of large numbers of gamefish relatively close to shore, within range of the boats of that era. As the vessels used for sportfishing became larger, faster, longer-ranged and more seaworthy, big-game species are now pursued on grounds ranging from 60 or 70 miles' distance from port, such as the submarine canyons of the United States continental shelf, to hundreds of miles as in the case of the San Diego long range fishery, where large live-aboard vessels range far out into the Pacific searching for tuna schools. Today big-game fishing is carried out from ports in tropical and temperate coasts practically worldwide. ===Anglo-America=== The United States has the world's largest saltwater fishing industry and along the entire length of the East Coast, from Key West to the Gulf of Maine, big-game anglers pursue a variety of tropical and temperate sportfish ranging from sailfish and dolphinfish in the Florida Keys to giant bluefin tuna in Massachusetts and in Canadian waters. The West Coast lacks the influence of the warm Gulf Stream current, and most big game species are mainly confined to California, a birthplace of the sport. Some of the same species that were fished for by the pioneers of the sport - Pacific bluefin tuna, broadbill swordfish and striped marlin - are still fished for today. ===Latin and South America=== Billfish and tuna are pursued in almost all the Latin American coastal nations, many of which are renowned for the excellence of their fishing. Mexico, Panama, Costa Rica, Venezuela, Ecuador and Guatemala have the largest fleets of sport fishing boats. Costa Rica's pacific coast, especially the coast of the Guanacaste Province, is famous for its fishing because of the ocean currents and the government catch and release laws. Rio San Juan in Nicaragua is famous for sport fishing for giant tarpon (fresh water tarpon fishing). The government presently enforces catch and release. An annual International tarpon fishing tournament has been held for many years. The 55th annual tournament was held September 13th & 14th 2015. ===Europe=== In the United Kingdom big-game tunny fishing off Scarborough was in fashion in the 1930s for a few years. Tunny was the name used in Britain at that time for Atlantic bluefin tuna. Colonel Edward Peel landed a world-record tunny of , capturing the record by from one caught off Nova Scotia by the American champion Zane Grey. ===Land-based game fishing=== In some areas big-game species can be caught by land-based anglers practicing land-based game fishing, with the rock platforms of Jervis Bay in New South Wales, Australia being probably the most well-known. Black marlin of up to 200 lbs have been caught here by anglers floating out baits on balloons. ==Boats== Big-game fishing requires a boat of sufficient seaworthiness and range to transport the crew to the fishing grounds and back. Boats that fit these requirements may be as small as the 18 to 21-foot trailerable boats commonly used along the Australian coast, in New Zealand and on the lee coasts of the Hawaiian Islands where they are known as the \\"mosquito fleet\\". At the other extreme the 100-foot and larger vessels of the San Diego long range fleet and similar, although less refined \\"party boats\\" operating from New England, transport 25, 30 or more anglers in search of yellowfin, bluefin and bigeye tuna. The cost of a suitable boat, electronics, tackle and the operating costs (fuels and other consumables, insurance, mooring fees and maintenance) can be very substantial. Consequently, many big-game anglers prefer to use charter services where they hire the use of a boat and equipment, and the fish-finding expertise of a captain, in preference to maintaining their own. Either way, big-game fishing can be an extremely expensive pursuit, and one in which the wealthy have tended to feature prominently. The classic sport fisherman Most of the features of the classic sport fisherman were gradually developed in the 1920s and 1930s as existing motor cruisers and commercial fishing vessels were adapted for fishing with outriggers, fighting chairs and other ancillaries such as bait boxes and flybridge helm stations. These boats, though crude by modern standards, scored many pioneering big game catches of huge bluefin tuna, broadbill swordfish and marlin. Through the 1930s and 1940s sportfishermen in Florida, amongst them John Rybovich and Ernest Hemingway, continued to innovate and refine, and in 1946 the Rybovich yard launched the Miss Chevy II, a 34-footer that crystallized all the innovations that had gone before into a design whose features - raised foredeck, flybridge controls and roomy cockpit - are still closely followed by today's leading sportfish builders. The need for greater range and speed as anglers sought gamefish further and further offshore resulted in the development of bigger boats powered by larger engines, but the basic layout of a dedicated big game fishing vessel has remained largely the same since the late 1940s. Smaller sportfishing boats The development of outboard power opened up many big game fishing grounds to smaller craft in the 18 to 25 foot range. Various boats designs may fit this category but in recent times the center console has become popular due to the ability to fish from all edges of the boat, providing the angler flexibility when fighting or landing fish. San Diego Long Range fleet and other partyboats Electronics Electronics technology developed for commercial fishermen has become increasingly used by recreational anglers. Fishfinders, also known as bottom machines or echo sounders, are now commonplace. Other electronics used to narrow down the search for fish may include radar, forward or side-scanning sonar, water temperature sensors and sea surface temperature imagery obtained from satellites. ==TechniquesTrolling=== Fish are enticed by trolling fishing lures (designed to resemble squid or other baitfish) or baits behind the boat. Multiple lines are often used. Outriggers were designed to spread the lines more widely. The outrigger holds the lines further away from the boat's wake, setting lures into more clear water thus making it easier for fish to target in on available lures. ===Chumming=== Chumming, or chunking, is the process of throwing pieces of bait fish overboard to attract larger game fish. This is called Berley in Australia. ===Fighting the fish=== Once a fish is properly hooked on a line, a somewhat tricky task as often initial nibbles only partly hook the fish, one of the fishermen attempts to reel it in. The captain assists by maneuvering the boat so that the fish remains astern (behind the boat), while other members of the crew race to reel in the other lines so as to avoid tangling with the angler reeling in the fish. Most of the time, the fishing line used for sport fishing has a breaking strain less than the maximum force the fish can apply to the line. The fishing reels therefore have sophisticated drag mechanisms which allow the line to escape if the fish pulls on it, but keep the specified tension on the line. When hooked, most fish will circulate in different directions, and when they are not pulling away from the boat the fisherman can take the opportunity to reel in some of the line. Eventually, if the fish tires and has not broken the line, they will be reeled in; however, the challenge does not end there. Hauling a heavy, powerful, and still very much alive fish on board the boat represents a considerable challenge, unless the fish is tagged and released. Strategies include: gaffing, pulling it in with ones hands, and if it is a smallish game fish, a net. The fish can be fought with or without a game-chair. With a game-chair, the angler sits in a specially designed chair at the stern of the boat, and places the butt of the rod into a gimbaled mount. Most rods used in this manner are quite long. The older and more classic models had straight rod butts. More contemporary models have bent rod butts, which give a more convenient angle for fighting the fish when the rod is placed in the mount. With large fish, this can still represent a considerable challenge, but \\"stand-up\\" game fishing, without the assistance of a chair and with the seat mount replaced by a harness, requires a good deal of strength and endurance, as well as body mass. ===Kite fishing=== Big Game fishing has evolved from a heavy tackle to a light tackle sport in many regions. Using a fishing kite has opened the door to fishing for Billfish, especially Sailfish with tackle as light as 8 or 12 lb but normally 20 - 30 lb gear is used. The kite is also effective on Tuna, Dolphin fish (Mahi Mahi), Sharks, Marlin, Swordfish & all sorts of other Big Game fish. The idea behind the kite is that a smaller live bait can be fished on lighter tackle and positioned away from the boat and placed right on the surface. The Bait fish will try to run away or fight to get deeper in the water column, but the kite will hold the bait in place. The fighting action and stress of the bait will \\"turn on\\" big game fish and cause them to strike. This method of fishing not only presents a bait to the Big Game Fish but drives the fish to strike the bait. ===Bait fishing=== Bait fishing is fishing while using bait. Bait is usually alive for catching better fish. ==See also== * Anglers * Sport fishing * Marlin fishing ==Notes== ==References== * Combs, Trey (1996) Bluewater Fly Fishing.

More precisely, the solution cannot be uniformly approximated by an asymptotic expansion :\\\\varphi(x) \\\\approx \\\\sum_{n=0}^N \\\\delta_n(\\\\varepsilon) \\\\psi_n(x) \\\\, as \\\\varepsilon \\\\to 0. Here \\\\varepsilon is the small parameter of the problem and \\\\delta_n(\\\\varepsilon) are a sequence of functions of \\\\varepsilon of increasing order, such as \\\\delta_n(\\\\varepsilon) = \\\\varepsilon^n. This is in contrast to regular perturbation problems, for which a uniform approximation of this form can be obtained. Singularly perturbed problems are generally characterized by dynamics operating on multiple scales. Several classes of singular perturbations are outlined below. The term \\"singular perturbation\\" was coined in the 1940s by Kurt Otto Friedrichs and Wolfgang R. Wasow. ==Methods of analysis== A perturbed problem whose solution can be approximated on the whole problem domain, whether space or time, by a single asymptotic expansion has a regular perturbation. Most often in applications, an acceptable approximation to a regularly perturbed problem is found by simply replacing the small parameter \\\\varepsilon by zero everywhere in the problem statement. This corresponds to taking only the first term of the expansion, yielding an approximation that converges, perhaps slowly, to the true solution as \\\\varepsilon decreases. The solution to a singularly perturbed problem cannot be approximated in this way: As seen in the examples below, a singular perturbation generally occurs when a problem's small parameter multiplies its highest operator. Thus naively taking the parameter to be zero changes the very nature of the problem. In the case of differential equations, boundary conditions cannot be satisfied; in algebraic equations, the possible number of solutions is decreased. Singular perturbation theory is a rich and ongoing area of exploration for mathematicians, physicists, and other researchers. The methods used to tackle problems in this field are many. The more basic of these include the method of matched asymptotic expansions and WKB approximation for spatial problems, and in time, the Poincar√©‚ÄìLindstedt method, the method of multiple scales and periodic averaging. For books on singular perturbation in ODE and PDE's, see for example Holmes, Introduction to Perturbation Methods,Holmes, Mark H. Introduction to Perturbation Methods. Springer, 1995.

Cambridge University Press, 1991. or Bender and Orszag, Advanced Mathematical Methods for Scientists and Engineers.Bender, Carl M. and Orszag, Steven A. Advanced Mathematical Methods for Scientists and Engineers. Springer, 1999. == Examples of singular perturbative problems == Each of the examples described below shows how a naive perturbation analysis, which assumes that the problem is regular instead of singular, will fail. Some show how the problem may be solved by more sophisticated singular methods. === Vanishing coefficients in ordinary differential equations === Differential equations that contain a small parameter that premultiplies the highest order term typically exhibit boundary layers, so that the solution evolves in two different scales. For example, consider the boundary value problem :\\\\begin{matrix} \\\\varepsilon u^{\\\\prime \\\\prime }(x)+u^{\\\\prime }(x) =-e^{-x},\\\\ \\\\ 0 Its solution when \\\\varepsilon=0.1 is the solid curve shown below. Note that the solution changes rapidly near the origin. If we naively set \\\\varepsilon=0, we would get the solution labelled \\"outer\\" below which does not model the boundary layer, for which x is close to zero. For more details that show how to obtain the uniformly valid approximation, see method of matched asymptotic expansions. File:Matching (perturbation).jpg === Examples in time === An electrically driven robot manipulator can have slower mechanical dynamics and faster electrical dynamics, thus exhibiting two time scales. In such cases, we can divide the system into two subsystems, one corresponding to faster dynamics and other corresponding to slower dynamics, and then design controllers for each one of them separately. Through a singular perturbation technique, we can make these two subsystems independent of each other, thereby simplifying the control problem. Consider a class of system described by following set of equations: :\\\\dot{x}_1 = f_1(x_1,x_2) + \\\\varepsilon g_1(x_1,x_2,\\\\varepsilon), \\\\, :\\\\varepsilon\\\\dot{x}_2 = f_2(x_1,x_2) + \\\\varepsilon g_2(x_1,x_2,\\\\varepsilon), \\\\, :x_1(0) = a_1, x_2(0) = a_2, \\\\, with 0<\\\\varepsilon <\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!< 1. The second equation indicates that the dynamics of x_2 is much faster than that of x_1. A theorem due to TikhonovTikhonov, A. N. (1952), \\"Systems of differential equations containing a small parameter multiplying the derivative\\" (in Russian), Mat. Sb. 31 (73), pp. 575‚Äì586 states that, with the correct conditions on the system, it will initially and very quickly approximate the solution to the equations :\\\\dot{x}_1 = f_1(x_1,x_2), \\\\, :f_2(x_1,x_2) = 0, \\\\, :x_1(0)=a_1,\\\\, on some interval of time and that, as \\\\varepsilon decreases toward zero, the system will approach the solution more closely in that same interval.Verhulst, Ferdinand. Methods and Applications of Singular Perturbations: Boundary Layers and Multiple Timescale Dynamics, Springer, 2005. . === Examples in space === In fluid mechanics, the properties of a slightly viscous fluid are dramatically different outside and inside a narrow boundary layer. Thus the fluid exhibits multiple spatial scales. Reaction‚Äìdiffusion systems in which one reagent diffuses much more slowly than another can form spatial patterns marked by areas where a reagent exists, and areas where it does not, with sharp transitions between them. In ecology, predator-prey models such as :u_t = \\\\varepsilon u_{xx} + uf(u) - vg(u), \\\\, :v_t = v_{xx} + vh(u), \\\\, where u is the prey and v is the predator, have been shown to exhibit such patterns.Owen, M. R. and Lewis, M. A. \\"How Predation can Slow, Stop, or Reverse a Prey Invasion\\", Bulletin of Mathematical Biology (2001) 63, 655-684. === Algebraic equations === Consider the problem of finding all roots of the polynomial p(x) = \\\\varepsilon x^3-x^2+1. In the limit \\\\varepsilon\\\\to 0, this cubic degenerates into the quadratic 1 - x^2 with roots at x = \\\\pm 1. Substituting a regular perturbation series :x(\\\\varepsilon) = x_0 + \\\\varepsilon x_1 + \\\\varepsilon^2 x_2+\\\\cdots in the equation and equating equal powers of \\\\varepsilon only yields corrections to these two roots: :x(\\\\varepsilon) = \\\\pm 1 + \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\varepsilon \\\\pm \\\\frac{5}{8}\\\\varepsilon^2+\\\\cdots . To find the other root, singular perturbation analysis must be used. We must then deal with the fact that the equation degenerates into a quadratic when we let \\\\varepsilon tend to zero, in that limit one of the roots escapes to infinity. To prevent this root from becoming invisible to the perturbative analysis, we must rescale x to keep track with this escaping root so that in terms of the rescaled variables, it doesn't escape. We define a rescaled variable x= \\\\frac{y}{\\\\varepsilon^{ u}} where the exponent u will be chosen such that we rescale just fast enough so that the root is at a finite value of y in the limit of \\\\varepsilon to zero, but such that it doesn't collapse to zero where the other two roots will end up. In terms of y we have :y^3 -\\\\varepsilon^{ u-1}y^2 + \\\\varepsilon^{3 u - 1} = 0 . We can see that for u < 1 the y^3 is dominated by the lower degree terms, while at u =1 it becomes as dominant as the y^2 term while they both dominate the remaining term. This point where the highest order term will no longer vanish in the limit \\\\varepsilon to zero by becoming equally dominant to another term, is called significant degeneration; this yields the correct rescaling to make the remaining root visible. This choice yields :y^3 -y^2 + \\\\varepsilon^2 = 0 . Substituting the perturbation series :y(\\\\varepsilon) = y_0 + \\\\varepsilon^2 y_1 + \\\\varepsilon^4 y_2+\\\\cdots yields :y_0^3 - y_0^2 = 0. We are then interested in the root at y_0 = 1; the double root at y_0 = 0 are the two roots that we've found above that collapse to zero in the limit of an infinite rescaling. Calculating the first few terms of the series then yields :x(\\\\varepsilon) = \\\\frac{y(\\\\varepsilon)}{\\\\varepsilon} = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\varepsilon} - \\\\varepsilon - 2\\\\varepsilon^3+\\\\cdots. ==References== Category:Differential equations Category:Nonlinear control Category:Perturbation theory ","title":"Singular perturbation"},{"id":"525236","text":"Expander may refer to: *Dynamic range compression operated in reverse *Part of the process of signal compression *Part of the process of companding *A component used to connect SCSI computer data storage, devices together *Turboexpander, a turbine for high-pressure gas *Expander graph, a sparse graph used in the combinatorics branch of mathematics *StuffIt Expander, a computer file decompressor software utility *\\"Expander\\" (song), a 1994 song by The Future Sound of London *Orthodontic expander, a device to widen the upper jaw *Disclosure widget, a widget that hides non-essential settings or information, also known as an expander ==See also== *Xpander (disambiguation) ","title":"Expander"},{"id":"525237","text":"James Edwin Webb (October 7, 1906 ‚Äì March 27, 1992) was an American government official who served as the second appointed administrator of NASA from February 14, 1961, to October 7, 1968.

With Webb's assistance, Pou was influential in pushing through the first legislation of Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal during the first hundred days of Roosevelt's term. In addition to his secretarial duties, Webb provided physical assistance to the aging and ailing Pou.Lambright, p. 18. ===Assistant to private attorney=== Webb next served as an assistant in the office of Oliver Max Gardner, an attorney, former governor of North Carolina and friend of President Roosevelt, from 1934 to 1936. Gardner supported Webb in finishing his law degree.Lambright, p. 20. During the Air Mail scandal of 1934, the government halted the carrying of airmail by private airline companies. A group of airline executives, led by Thomas Morgan, the President of the Sperry Gyroscope Company in Brooklyn, hired Gardner's firm to represent them. The successful resolution resulted in the resumption of contracts to private airlines. ===Personnel director for Sperry Gyroscope=== As a result of their interactions, Sperry Gyroscope hired Webb as the personnel director and assistant to Thomas Morgan, the president of Sperry. Between 1936 and 1944, Webb became the secretary-treasurer and later the vice president of Sperry. During his tenure, Sperry expanded from 800 employees to more than 33,000 and became a major supplier of navigation equipment and airborne radar systems during World War II.Lambright, pp. 20‚Äì22. ===Marine re-enlistment=== Although he wished to re-enlist in the Marines at the start of the war, Webb was deferred because of the importance of his work at Sperry to the war effort. By 1944, however, he was allowed to re-enlist in the Marines, where he became the commanding officer, Marine Air Warning Group One, 9th Marine Aircraft Wing, first as a captain and later as a major. He was put in charge of a radar program for the invasion of the Japanese mainland. He had orders to leave for Japan on August 14, 1945, but his orders were delayed, and the Surrender of Japan on September 2, 1945, meant that he did not see combat.Lambright, pp. 28‚Äì29. ===Bureau of the Budget=== After World War II, Webb returned to Washington, DC and served as executive assistant to Gardner, now the Undersecretary of the Treasury, for a short while before he was named as the director of the Bureau of the Budget in the Office of the President of the United States, a position that he held until 1949. Webb was recommended for the appointment to Truman by Gardner and Treasury Secretary John Snyder. Because of Webb's association with the Treasury Department, his appointment was seen as subordinating the BoB to the Treasury. His appointment surprised Webb, who had not been told of the final decision to appoint him. (During the appointment announcement, Truman forgot Webb's name and had to look it up.)Lambright, p. 32. The Bureau of the Budget prepared the President's proposed budget each year for presentation to Congress. Truman's objective for the budget was to bring it to balance after the large expenditures of World War II.Lambright, pp. 34‚Äì35. ===State Department=== President Harry S. Truman next nominated Webb to serve as an undersecretary of state in the U.S. Department of State, which he began in January 1949. Webb's first assignment from Secretary Dean Acheson was to reorganize the Department, adding 12 new Presidential appointees and reducing the power of subordinate officers. Webb also consolidated the flow of foreign policy information and intelligence through the secretariat. When the new organization became law in June 1949, the Department, which had been losing power and influence to the military, strengthened its ties to the President.Lambright, pp. 50‚Äì51. Webb joined the State Department during McCarthyism, and the Department was under considerable pressure from Congress to root out communists, anarchists and others deemed un-American and a security risk. Webb met with Truman in 1950 to discuss the administration's response to the Congressional hearings. Webb testified to a Senate committee that most of the people removed from the government for moral turpitude were homosexuals.Edsall, Nicholas (2003). Toward Stonewall: Homosexuality and Society in the Modern Western World, University of Virginia Press. Although the White House was not politically able to quell Congressional fervor, it implemented a strategy to emphasize the medical aspects and play down the security concerns of homosexuals in the government.David K. Johnson, The Lavender Scare: The Cold War Persecution of Gays and Lesbians in the Federal Government (University of Chicago Press, 2004), 104‚Äì107 One of the biggest questions facing the Department of State at the time was whether the Soviet Union could be contained through only diplomatic means or whether the military would be needed. Paul Nitze, as Director of Policy Planning, wrote a classified memo, NSC 68, arguing for a military build-up of NATO forces. Although Secretary of Defense Louis A. Johnson opposed an increase in the Defense budget, Webb got Truman to convince him to support the recommendations of NSC68.Lambright, p. 59. On 25 June 1950, the North Korean Army invaded South Korea. Webb and Secretary Acheson devised three recommendations: involve the United Nations, send the Navy Pacific Fleet into the Yellow Sea, and authorize an Air Force strike on the Korean tanks.Lambright, pp. 60‚Äì61. Truman implemented the first two recommendations immediately but delayed the use of force by several days. The Defense Department was blamed for the lack of US preparedness, and Johnson tried to blame Acheson. Webb worked with his contacts in Congress and others to convince Truman to replace Johnson, and George Marshall was called out of retirement to become the new Secretary of Defense. Pursuing his scientific interest, Webb sought to increase the propaganda role in the Cold War. He set up an alliance with university scientists, Project Troy, to study radio propagation behind the Iron Curtain. With the attention of the Department focused on the Korean War, Webb's influence weakened. As the author of NSC68, Nitze became the principal advisor to Secretary Acheson, and a misunderstanding between Webb and Nitze led to Nitze outwardly calling for Webb's resignation. Although the rift blew over, Webb started suffering from migraine and resigned in February 1952. Webb left Washington for a position in the Kerr-McGee Oil Corp. in Oklahoma City, but he was still active in government circles, for instance in serving on the Draper Committee in 1958. ==NASA== Webb presents NASA's Group Achievement Award to Kennedy Space Center Director Kurt H. Debus, while Wernher von Braun (center) looks on. Webb, Vice President Lyndon Johnson, Kurt Debus, and President John F. Kennedy receive a briefing on Saturn I launch operations during a tour of Launch Complex 34, September 1962. On February 14, 1961, Webb accepted President John F. Kennedy's appointment as Administrator of NASA, taking the reins from interim director, Hugh L. Dryden, Deputy Administrator. Webb directed NASA's undertaking of the goal set by Kennedy of landing an American on the Moon before the end of the 1960s through the Apollo program. For seven years after Kennedy's May 25, 1961, announcement of the goal of a manned lunar landing until October 1968, Webb lobbied for support for NASA in Congress. As a longtime Washington insider and with the backing of President Lyndon B. Johnson, he was able to produce continued support and resources for Apollo. During his administration, NASA developed from a loose collection of research centers to a co-ordinated organization. Webb had a key role in creating the Manned Spacecraft Center, later the Johnson Space Center, in Houston. Despite the pressures to focus on the Apollo program, Webb ensured that NASA carried out a program of planetary exploration with the Mariner and Pioneer space programs. After the Apollo 1 accident in 1967, Webb told the media, \\"We've always known that something like this was going to happen sooner or later... Who would have thought that the first tragedy would be on the ground?\\" Webb went to Johnson and asked for NASA to be allowed to handle the accident investigation and to direct its recovery, according to a procedure that was established following the in-flight accident on Gemini 8. He promised to be truthful in assessing blame, even to himself and NASA management, as appropriate. The agency set out to discover the details of the tragedy, to correct problems, and to continue progress toward the Apollo 11 lunar landing. Webb reported the investigation board's findings to various congressional committees, and he took a personal blaming at nearly every meeting. Whether by happenstance or by design, Webb managed to deflect some of the backlash over the accident away from both NASA as an agency and from the Johnson administration. As a result, NASA's image and popular support were largely undamaged.NASA Distinguished Service Award/Medal, November 1, 1968 Webb was a Democrat tied closely to Johnson, and since Johnson chose not to run for reelection, Webb decided to step down as administrator to allow the next president, Republican Richard Nixon, to choose his own administrator.http://www.lbjlibrary.net/assets/documents/archives/oral_histories/webb-j/webb.pdf Webb oral biography. Transcript, James E. Webb Oral History Interview I, 1969/04/29, by T. H. Baker, Internet Copy, LBJ Library. Accessed May 28, 2009. Webb was informed by CIA sources in 1968 that the Soviet Union was developing its own heavy N1 rocket for a manned lunar mission, and he directed NASA to prepare Apollo 8 for a possible lunar orbital mission that year. At the time, Webb's assertions about the Soviet Union's abilities were doubted by some people, and the N-1 was dubbed \\"Webb's Giant\\". However, later revelations about the Soviet Moonshot, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, have given support to Webb's conclusion. Webb left NASA in October 1968, just before the first manned flight in the Apollo program. In 1969, Webb was presented with the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Johnson. He is a 1976 recipient of the Langley Gold Medal from the Smithsonian Institution. ==Later life== After retiring from NASA, Webb remained in Washington, DC, serving on several advisory boards, including serving as a regent of the Smithsonian Institution. In 1981, he was awarded the Sylvanus Thayer Award by the United States Military Academy at West Point for his dedication to his country. Webb died in 1992 and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery. ==Personal life== Webb married Patsy Aiken Douglas in 1938, and they had two children: Sarah Gorham Webb (b. 1945), and James Edwin Webb Jr. (b. 1947). Webb was a Freemason.https://freemasonscommunity.life/famous-freemasons-a-z-the-end/ ==Legacy== Webb was played by Dan Lauria in the 1998 miniseries, From the Earth to the Moon. Webb was played by Ken Strunk in the 2016 film, Hidden Figures. NASA's planned James Webb Space Telescope was renamed in Webb's honor in 2002. This telescope, to be launched in 2021, is referred to as \\"the Hubble successor\\". ==See also== ==References== Bibliography * W. Henry Lambright, Powering Apollo: James E.

In the figurative sense, it is used to describe a situation in which an agreement has been made that is open-ended or vague, and therefore subject to abuse, or in which a party is willing to consider any expense in the pursuance of their goals. == Literal meaning == Cheque writers are advised to specify the amount of the cheque before signing it. A blank cheque can be extremely expensive for the drawer who writes the cheque, because whoever obtains the cheque could write in any amount of money, and might be able to cash it (if the current account (US: checking account) contains sufficient funds, and depending on the laws in the specific country). Under American law, a blank cheque is an example of an \\"\\" as defined in the Uniform Commercial Code's Article 3, Section 115 (a). Writing an amount in a blank cheque, without the authority of the signer, is an \\"alteration\\". It is legally equivalent to changing the numbers on a completed (non-blank) cheque. In finance, a \\"blank cheque company\\" refers to a company in development that has no specific business plan, such as a special purpose acquisition company. ==Metaphorical meaningIn politics=== * On July 5, 1914, Germany gave Austria a \\"blank cheque\\" in handling its punishment of Serbia regarding the assassination of the heir to the Austrian throne. It led to the start of the First World War. German Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg told the Austrian ambassador in Berlin that the Austrian Emperor had the support of the German Kaiser: ::Finally, as far as concerns Serbia, His Majesty, of course, cannot interfere in the dispute now going on between Austria- Hungary and that country, as it is a matter not within his competence. The Emperor Francis Joseph may, however, rest assured that His Majesty will faithfully stand by Austria-Hungary, as is required by the obligations of his alliance and of his ancient friendship. *In March 2003, Gordon Brown, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, \\"effectively offered a blank cheque for war against Iraq\\", and would thus '\\"spend what it takes\\" to tackle Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.' ===In literature=== Sir Arthur Conan Doyle used the term carte blanche in several of his Sherlock Holmes stories. * \\"A Scandal in Bohemia\\": > \\"Then, as to money?\\" \\"You have carte blanche.\\" \\"Absolutely?\\" \\"I tell you > that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to have that > photograph.\\" * \\"The Adventure of the Beryl Coronet\\": > \\"I understand that you give me carte blanche to act for you, provided only > that I get back the gems, and that you place no limit on the sum I may > draw.\\" \\"I would give my fortune to have them back.\\" == See also == * Blank endorsement * List of political metaphors * Cheque#United States * Tabula rasa * ==References== Category:Financial regulation Category:Cheques Category:Political metaphors ","title":"Blank cheque"},{"id":"525260","text":"This is a list of common political metaphors. ==Relating to the executive== * eminence grise: literally, \\"grey man,\\" from French.

During his career he was studio manager of Paramount Pictures, and Samuel Goldwyn Studios, and was briefly on the staff of Vega Aircraft Corporation. Glennan joined the Columbia University Division of War Research in 1942, serving throughout World War II, first as Administrator and then as Director of the U.S. Navy's Underwater Sound Laboratories at New London, Connecticut. At the end of the war, Glennan became an executive of the Ansco Corp. in Binghamton, New York. From this position he was called to the presidency of the Case Institute of Technology in Cleveland, Ohio. During his administration, Case rose from a primarily local institution to rank with the top engineering schools in the United States. From October 1950 to November 1952, concurrent with his Case presidency, he served as a member of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. ==Administration== As NASA Administrator, Glennan presided over an organization that had absorbed the earlier National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) intact; its 8,000 employees, an annual budget of US$100 million, and three major research laboratories--Langley Aeronautical Laboratory, Ames Aeronautical Laboratory, and Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory--and two small test facilities made up the core of the new NASA. Within a short time after NASA's formal organization, Glennan incorporated several organizations involved in space exploration projects from other federal agencies into NASA to ensure that a viable scientific program of space exploration could be reasonably conducted over the long-term. He brought in part of the Naval Research Laboratory in NASA and created for its use the Goddard Space Flight Center. He also incorporated several disparate satellite programs, two lunar probes, and the research effort to develop a million pound force (4.4 MN) thrust, single-chamber rocket engine from the U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Department of Defense's (DOD) Advanced Research Projects Agency. In December 1958 Glennan also acquired control of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a contractor facility operated by the California Institute of Technology. In 1960, Glennan obtained the transfer to NASA of the Army Ballistic Missile Agency, located at Huntsville, Alabama, and renamed it the Marshall Space Flight Center. By mid-1960, Glennan had secured for NASA primacy in the U.S. federal government for the execution of all space activities except reconnaissance satellites, ballistic missiles, and a few other space-related projects, most of which were still in the study stage, that the DOD controlled. ==Later career== Upon leaving NASA in January 1961, Glennan returned to the Case Institute of Technology, where he continued to serve as president until 1966. During this period he helped to negotiate the merger of Case with Western Reserve University, creating Case Western Reserve University. After his retirement in 1966, Glennan spent two years as president of Associated Universities, Inc., a Washington-based advocate for institutions of higher education. A resident of Reston, Virginia for twenty years after his retirement, he moved to Mitchellville, Maryland in the late 1980s. He died at Collington Life Care Community in Mitchellville in April 1995, after a stroke. He was survived by his wife, Ruth (n√©e Adams) Glennan. ==References== *Portions of this article are based on public domain biographical text from NASA. ==External links== *Diary of T.

Ace worked as a roller skating messenger for Montgomery Ward while he studied journalism at Kansas City Polytechnic Institute. He also wrote a weekly column called \\"The Dyspeptic\\" for the school's newspaper. After working at the post office and a local haberdashery to support his mother and sisters after his father's death, he became a reporter and columnist for the Kansas City Journal-Post. Jane Epstein was his high school sweetheart. Jane wanted to attend the sold-out performance of Al Jolson in Kansas City; her boyfriends were unable to get tickets, but Ace had access to the concert via his press pass. The Jolson concert was the couple's first date; they married six months later, in 1922. ==Radio aces== In 1930, Ace took on a second job reading the Sunday comics on radio station KMBC (anticipating the famous newspaper strike stunt, almost two decades later, by legendary New York mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia) and hosting a Friday night film review and gossip program called Ace Goes to the Movies. Ace was not initially a volunteer for the job. An editor at the Journal-Post had the idea that having an employee read the newspaper's comics on the air for children would increase circulation for the paper. Taking the job meant an extra $10 per week in one's paycheck, but none of the newsroom staff was interested. The editor, reasoning that since Ace's current assignment was covering local theater he would be the perfect man for the job, insisted he take it. Ace suggested a second radio show, this one dealing with films, thus collecting an additional $10 per week. But one night the recorded fifteen-minute show scheduled to air after Ace's timeslot failed to feed. With an immediate need to fill fifteen minutes' more airtime and his wife having accompanied him to the station that night, Ace slipped into an impromptu chat about a bridge game the couple played the previous weekend and invited Jane to join the chat which soon enough included discussion of a local murder case in which a wife murdered her husband over an argument about bridge. Loaded with Goodman's wry wit and Jane's knack for malaprops (\\"Would you care to shoot a game of bridge, dear?\\"), the couple's surprise improvisation provoked a response enthusiastic enough to convince KMBC to hand them a regular fifteen-minute slot, creating and performing a \\"domestic comedy\\" of their own. At first, the show that became known as Easy Aces centered around the couple's bridge playing, according to John Dunning in On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998): \\"Ace was not wild about Jane's bridge game, on the air or off, and he kept picking at her until she lost her temper and threatened to quit. The show settled into a new niche, a more universally based domestic comedy revolving around Jane's improbable situations and her impossible turns of phrase.\\" Written by Goodman Ace, who cast himself as a harried real estate salesman and the exasperated but loving husband of the scatterbrained, malaprop-prone Jane (\\"You've got to take the bitter with the better\\"; \\"Time wounds all heels\\"), Easy Aces became a long- running serial comedy (1930‚Äì1945) and a low-keyed legend of old-time radio for its literate, unobtrusive, conversational style and the malaprops of the female half of the team. The show was never a rating blockbuster, but according to Dunning it \\"was always a favourite of Radio Row insiders. Like Fred Allen and Henry Morgan, Ace was considered an intelligent man's wit. His show limped along [but] . . . lasted across several formats for more than fifteen years and was one of radio's fondest memories.\\" The radio show was popular enough to get to the big screen; in 1934, the couple signed with Educational Pictures for some two-reel comedies. Dumb Luck was released 18 January 1935, with Goodman and Jane playing their radio characters. While writing Easy Aces, Ace also wrote for other radio shows, earning $3,000 per week in this way. During World War II, he participated in the selection of music for the War Department's Hit Kit song book series as part of a carefully selected group of writers, composers, and show business personalities known collectively as the \\"Committee of 25\\". In 1945, Ace signed on as one of the writers of The Danny Kaye Show. Previously he and Jane had been part of a series of celebrity guests who filled in for Kaye while he entertained the armed forces troops who were overseas. When Kaye moved his show from New York to Hollywood, Ace resigned.(subscription required) Whether writing for himself and Jane or for another performer, Ace's rating system of how well a script would do was based on the number of cigars he smoked while writing it. One cigar meant the show would do very well, while four cigars meant this program or episode was most likely hopeless.(subscription required) Ace was sued in 1940 because of the name he selected for a character. He used the first name of one of his staff coupled with the last name of another. Unknown to Ace, this resulted in the name of a real person who was publicly embarrassed by the use of his name on the show. He then began the practice of having those on the program use their own names for their characters. In 1948, Ace created a new, half-hour version of the show, mr. ace and JANE; this expanded version, perhaps because a live studio audience detracted from its quiet style (a point made especially vivid by its audience-less, quiet audition show, and when new episodes expanded upon some of the old show's vintages), didn't last beyond a single season. And it fared no better on television. In 1956, both Ace and NBC thought seriously enough about another try for the television series to announce Ernie Kovacs and his wife Edie Adams would play the Aces in a pilot for the show; it is unknown whether the pilot took place. The husband and wife team returned to network radio with the debut of NBC's Monitor; the Aces were announced as \\"Communicators\\" just after Dave Garroway's joining the show. They were also part of NBC Radio's Weekday, which was a Monday through Friday network offering aimed at women that premiered not long after Monitor. Ace branched out by writing commercials, featuring himself and Jane. The couple also voiced some commercials used on NBC's Startime, while other actors played the visual roles. ==\\"Terrible Vaudeville\\" and You Are There== Ace needled television in a 1953 letter to Groucho Marx: \\"...TV‚Äîa clever contraction derived from the words Terrible Vaudeville. However, it is our latest medium‚Äîwe call it a medium because nothing's well done.\\"Groucho Marx, The Groucho Letters: Letters From and To Groucho Marx, (NY: Simon & Schuster, 1967) p. 114. Nonetheless, he hadn't been averse to giving television a try. Goodman and Jane Ace adapted Easy Aces to television in December 1949, with a fifteen-minute filmed version on the DuMont network (also syndicated in some areas through Ziv Television Programs) that ended in mid-June 1950, after airing Wednesday nights from 7:45‚Äì8:00 p.m. \\"As on radio,\\" authors Tim Brooks and Earle Marsh wrote, \\"Ace was his witty, intelligent self, and his wife, Jane, was a charming bundle of malapropisms\\". The television show included Betty Garde as Jane Ace's friend, Dorothy. What it didn't include was an audience equal to the ones who kept Easy Aces on radio for all those years. The demise of the show also meant the demise of the Aces' career in front of a microphone or camera. Jane Ace retired almost completely; Goodman Ace merely retired as a performer, becoming mainly a writer from 1949 forward. Ace did have a serious side, too, and he melded it to his sense of the absurd to create a radio show with the twist of taking listeners to re-created historical events described by actual CBS News reporters. The problem, as revealed by CBS historian Robert Metz (in CBS: Reflections in a Bloodshot Eye), was that Ace didn't get official credit for his creation for many years; a CBS executive vice president named Desmond Taylor gained the original credit for the show born on radio as CBS Was There and famed (especially on television, with future anchor Walter Cronkite narrating) for its introduction, which leapt into the American vernacular: \\"All things are as they were then, except you... are... there!\\" == \\"You Gentlemen, The Authors\\" == Ace and Perry Como confer before the start of The Perry Como Show on 17 September 1955. By this time, however, Ace began writing for other performers; Milton Berle, Perry Como, Danny Kaye, Robert Q. Lewis, and Bob Newhart were some who engaged this witty man with a winking inability to take himself too seriously. (He would be nominated for Emmy Awards twice during his term as Como's head writer, in 1956 and 1959.) Ace rationalized his work by saying, \\"I'm not in television. I'm with Perry Como.\\" Perhaps his best turn of writing in these years, however, was his collaboration with Frank Wilson on The Big Show, considered NBC's last-gasp attempt to keep classic radio alive. This 90-minute variety program was hosted by Tallulah Bankhead and featured a rotating cast that included some of America's and the world's greatest entertainers, including Fred Allen, Groucho Marx, Jimmy Durante, Joan Davis, Bob Hope, Louis Armstrong, George Jessel, Ethel Merman, Jos√© Ferrer, Ed Wynn, Lauritz Melchior, Ezio Pinza, √âdith Piaf, Ginger Rogers, Ethel Barrymore, Phil Silvers, Benny Goodman, and Danny Thomas. The show was ripened by Ace's wry style, adapted to Bankhead's diva-blunt style and the differing ways of the various guests who joined in the show. (Ace said years later that one of his secrets was isolating particular interests of the guests ‚Äì for example, Ginger Rogers' passion for playing golf ‚Äì and write comic routines around those interests.) For his part Ace remembered working with Bankhead fondly in later years. \\"'You gentlemen, the authors,' she would say\\", Ace once told author Robert Metz. \\"We gag writers felt pretty good about that.\\" What he didn't necessarily feel good about, as he told radio interviewers Richard Lamparski and John Dunning two decades later, was the writers' non-mention in Bankhead's memoir recollection about The Big Show. Ace had known Jack Benny since his Kansas City years. Radio historian Arthur Frank Wertheim recorded (in Radio Comedy) that, as a young newspaper reporter and columnist, Ace had written a witty gossip column that moved Benny himself to ask the young writer for some jokes for his stage act. Benny asked for more and paid Ace $50 for one packet of jokes. \\"Your jokes got lots of laughs\\", said the note Benny sent with the check. \\"If you have any more, send them along\\". Ace, according to Wertheim, returned the check with a note: \\"Your check got lots of laughs. If you have any more, send them along\\". Ace ended up supplying Benny with gags on the house for years, Wertheim noted. Benny was inadvertently responsible for a very funny exchange of letters between Ace and the owner of the Stork Club, Sherman Billingsley. Benny invited him to lunch at the Stork; when Ace got to the club, Benny had not yet arrived. The staff at the Stork Club did not recognize Ace and he received a very cool reception. When Benny finally did get to the Stork, he was told Ace didn't want to wait and left. Soon Billingsley's notes began to arrive in Ace's mailbox, inviting him to come to the club for the marvelous air conditioning. Ace wrote back that he was well aware of how cool it was at the Stork, having received the cold shoulder there. Billingsley's response was a gift‚Äîbow ties for Ace. Ace's reply was to ask Billingsley for some matching socks so he would be well-dressed when he was refused admittance again.(subscription required) Ace wrote one screenplay, I Married a Woman, in 1957. Calling it the best thing he had ever written, but the worst thing he had ever seen after viewing the film, Ace never tried his hand at screenwriting again. When the couple's Miami hotel room was robbed in 1966, Ace managed to find humor in the situation. Ace's influence went further. He revealed in the mid-1960s that CBS once developed a kind of school for young comedy writers, with Ace himself \\"placed in charge of a group of six or seven young writers who wanted to make all that easy money\\", as he recalled in a later magazine column. All became television writers and two eventually became successful playwrights: George Axelrod (The Seven Year Itch) and Neil Simon (Barefoot in the Park, The Odd Couple, The Goodbye Girl). == The Saturday Reviewer == Ace became a regular columnist for Saturday Review (formerly The Saturday Review of Literature; he liked to suggest cause-and- effect in the magazine's name changing two weeks after his debut in its pages) in the early 1950s. At first, he focused‚Äîin what a publisher described (considering his parallel employment writing for television) as \\"nibbling the hand that feeds him\\"‚Äîon television criticism in his usual droll style; a collection of this criticism was published in 1955 as The Book of Little Knowledge: More Than You Want to Know About Television. Later, Ace shifted to more broad contemporary concerns and called the column \\"Top of My Head\\"; these essays became as well-read as his old radio show had been, without being either too frivolous or too overbearing. Sometimes, they were gentle; sometimes, they were more tart, always they were without genuine malice. Often they included his beloved Jane, and they were strongly enough received to provoke two published collections, The Fine Art of Hypochondria; or, How Are You? and The Better of Goodman Ace. As if suggesting that radio had never really left him, Ace assembled and published a collection of eight complete Easy Aces scripts, with new essays and comments from the Aces, as Ladies and Gentlemen ‚Äì Easy Aces in 1970. He also held a small regular slot offering witty commentaries on New York station WPAT for a time, before going out over the full National Public Radio network during the 1970s. Also around that time, two decades after the brief, unsuccessful television adaptation of Easy Aces, someone else was willing to give the concept a fresh television try: a number of the original Easy Aces radio scripts were adapted for the Canadian CTV Television Network show The Trouble with Tracy in 1970. However, though 130 episodes of this series were produced (all in 1970/71), and the show was re-run well into the 1980s on Canadian TV, The Trouble With Tracy was regarded as an almost unqualified disaster on a creative level. This had less to do with the scripts, however, and more with the incredible cheapness of the production. Seven episodes were filmed every five days on wobbly sets, with almost no time for rehearsal for either the actors or the technical crew‚Äîflubbed lines and bloopers sometimes ended up airing in finished episodes, because the show could not afford retakes. Ultimately, The Trouble With Tracy is often cited, especially in Canada, as the worst sitcom ever made. Note, though, that while Ace had a hand in the modern adaptation of the scripts, neither he nor Jane Ace appeared in it, and neither played any part in the actual production of the series. Jane Ace died after a long illness in 1974, just days before what would have been their fiftieth wedding anniversary. Her husband's tribute to her in the 8 February 1975 issue (\\"Jane\\") provoked hundreds of letters from his regular readers and from the couple's old radio fans. > \\"...now alone at a funeral home...the questions...the softly spoken > suggestions...repeated, and repeated... because ...because during all the > arrangements, through my mind there ran a constant rerun, a line she spoke > on radio...on the brotherhood of man ...in her casual, malapropian style ... > \\"we are all cremated equal\\" ... they kept urging for an answer...a wooden > casket? ... a metal casket? ...it's the name of their game ... a tisket a > casket...and then transporting it to Kansas City, Mo. ...the plane > ride...\\"smoking or non-smoking section?\\" somebody asked ... the non-thinking > section was what I wanted.... \\"...a soft sprinkle of snow as we huddled > around her...the first of the season, they told me ... lasted only through > the short service ...snow stopped the instant the last words were spoken. He > had the grace to celebrate her arrival with a handful of His confetti ...\\" == Death == Goodman Ace died eight years after his wife, in their New York City home in March 1982; the couple is interred together in a suburb of their native Kansas City. \\"Mr. Ace\\", wrote The New York Times's obituarist, David Bird, \\"liked to scoff at ratings. He said that neither the writer nor a star alone could make or break a comedy show. It took, he said, a good time spot and teamwork. 'The whole thing has to be a kind of partnership‚Äîa marriage between writer and performer,' he explained, 'If there is no marriage‚Äîwell you know what the brainchild has to be'.\\" The author of CBS: Reflections in a Bloodshot Eye, Robert Metz, recalled that, once, a relative of Ace's had wired him to say, \\"Send me $10,000 or I'll jump from the fourteenth floor of my building\\", and Ace was said to have wired back, \\"Jump from seven‚ÄîI'll send $5,000.\\" Whether or not this was a true story or an Ace gag, it was understatedly madcap enough that it could have been true. When CBS fired Ace as the head of its \\"comedy workshop\\" in the late 1940s, according to Time, a sympathetic network vice president told him afterward, \\"I'll tell you a secret‚Äîwe haven't got a man who understands comedy.\\" Ace wryly replied, \\"I'll tell you a secret‚Äîthat's no secret.\\" Ace offered his own epitaph when Saturday Review ran a poll asking well-known Americans to nominate members of a contemporary Hall of Fame. \\"I respectfully suggest the name of Goodman Ace...if he's still around\\", Ace replied. \\"If he isn't, I wouldn't dig him up just for this.\\" The National Radio Hall of Fame respectfully ignored that suggestion, inducting Easy Aces in 1990. == References == ==Further reading== *Goodman Ace, The Book of Little Knowledge; Or, More Than You Want to Know About Television (New York; 1955). *Goodman Ace, The Fine Art of Hypochondria; or, How Are You?

Roadside sign in the Nubra Valley, Ladkah, India Interfaith dialogue refers to cooperative, constructive, and positive interaction between people of different religious traditions (i.e., \\"faiths\\") and/or spiritual or humanistic beliefs, at both the individual and institutional levels. It is distinct from syncretism or alternative religion, in that dialogue often involves promoting understanding between different religions or beliefs to increase acceptance of others, rather than to synthesize new beliefs. The Archdiocese of Chicago's Office for Ecumenical and Interreligious Affairs defines \\"the difference between ecumenical, interfaith, and interreligious relations\\", as follows: *\\"ecumenical\\" as \\"relations and prayer with other Christians\\", *\\"interfaith\\" as \\"relations with members of the 'Abrahamic faiths' (Jewish and Muslim traditions),\\" and *\\"interreligious\\" as \\"relations with other religions, such as Hinduism and Buddhism\\".

Similarly, pluralistic rationalist groups have hosted public reasoning dialogues to transcend all worldviews (whether religious, cultural or political), termed transbelief dialogue.\\"Promising Practice: Finding Common Ground Through Difference,\\" Harvard Pluralism Project. Retrieved November 02, 2012. To some, the term interreligious dialogue has the same meaning as interfaith dialogue. Neither are the same as nondenominational Christianity. The World Council of Churches distinguishes between 'interfaith' and 'interreligious'. To the WCC, interreligious refers to action between different Christian denominations. So, interfaith refers to interaction between different faith groups such as Muslim and Christian or Jew for example. Throughout the world there are local, regional, national and international interfaith initiatives; many are formally or informally linked and constitute larger networks or federations.

Friar James L. Heft, in a lecture on \\"The Necessity of Inter-Faith Diplomacy,\\" spoke about the conflicts among practitioners of the three Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity and Islam). Noting that except for the Convivencia in the 14th and 15th centuries, believers in these religions have either kept their distance or have been in conflict, Heft maintains, \\"there has been very little genuine dialogue\\" between them. \\"The sad reality has been that most of the time Jews, Muslims and Christians have remained ignorant about each other, or worse, especially in the case of Christians and Muslims, attacked each other.\\" In contrast, The Pluralism Project at Harvard University says, \\"Every religious tradition has grown through the ages in dialogue and historical interaction with others. Christians, Jews, and Muslims have been part of one another's histories, have shared not only villages and cities, but ideas of God and divine revelation.\\" The importance of Abrahamic interfaith dialogue in the present has been bluntly presented: \\"We human beings today face a stark choice: dialogue or death!\\" More broadly, interfaith dialogue and action have occurred over many centuries: *In the 16th century, the Emperor Akbar encouraged tolerance in Mughal India, a diverse nation with people of various faith backgrounds, including Islam, Hinduism, Sikhism, and Christianity. *Religious pluralism can also be observed in other historical contexts, including Muslim Spain. Zarmanochegas (Zarmarus) (ŒñŒ±œÅŒºŒ±ŒΩŒøœáŒ∑Œ≥·Ω∞œÇ) was a monk of the Sramana tradition (possibly, but not necessarily a Buddhist) from India who journeyed to Antioch and Athens while Augustus (died 14 CE) was ruling the Roman Emprire.Strabo, xv, 1, on the immolation of the Sramana in Athens (Paragraph 73) .liv. Cassius Dio, Roman History, 9. *\\"Disputation of Barcelona ‚Äì religious disputation between Jews and Christians in 1263. The apostate Paulus [Pablo] Christiani proposed to King James I of Aragon that a formal public religious disputation on the fundamentals of faith should be held between him and R. Moses b. Nahman (Nachmanides) whom he had already encountered in Gerona. The disputation took place with the support of the ecclesiastical authorities and the generals of the Dominican and Franciscan orders, while the king presided over a number of sessions and took an active part in the disputation. The Dominicans Raymond de Pe√±aforte, Raymond Martini, and Arnold de Segarra, and the general of the Franciscan order in the kingdom, Peter de Janua, were among the Christian disputants. The single representative for the Jewish side was Na·∏•manides. The four sessions of the disputation took place on July 20, 27, 30, and 31, 1263 (according to another calculation, July 20, 23, 26, and 27). Na·∏•manides was guaranteed complete freedom of speech in the debate; he took full advantage of the opportunity thus afforded and spoke with remarkable frankness. Two accounts of the disputation, one in Hebrew written by Na·∏•manides and a shorter one in Latin, are the main sources for the history of this important episode in Judeo-Christian polemics. According to both sources the initiative for the disputation and its agenda were imposed by the Christian side, although the Hebrew account tries to suggest a greater involvement of Na·∏•manides in finalizing the items to be discussed. When the ecclesiastics who saw the \\"not right\\" turn the disputation was taking, due to Nahmanides persuasive argumentation, they urged that it should be ended as speedily as possible. It was, therefore, never formally concluded, but interrupted. According to the Latin record of the proceedings, the disputation ended because Nahmanides fled prematurely from the city. In fact, however, he stayed on in Barcelona for over a week after the disputation had been suspended in order to be present in the synagogue on the following Sabbath when a conversionist sermon was to be delivered. The king himself attended the synagogue and gave an address, an event without medieval precedent. Nahmanides was permitted to reply on this occasion. The following day, after receipt of a gift of 300 s√≥lidos from the king, he returned home.\\" :\\"While the Disputation may have been a great achievement for Paulus Christiani in his innovative use of rabbinic sources in Christian missionary efforts, for Na·∏•manides it represented an additional example of the wise and courageous leadership which he offered his people.\\"A History of the Jews in Christian Spain, Volume 1 Gleanings : Essays in Jewish History, Letters, and Art by Cecil Roth.

The congress was the first organized, international gathering of religious leaders. Since its first meeting in 1893, there have been eight meetings including one in 2015. ===20th-century initiatives=== *In 1900, the International Association for Religious Freedom (IARF) was founded under a name different from its current one. In 1987, its statement of purpose was revised to include advancing \\"understanding, dialogue and readiness to learn and promotes sympathy and harmony among the different religious traditions\\". In 1990, its membership was enlarged \\"to include all the world's major religious groups\\". In 1996, IARF's World Congress included representatives of Palestinian and Israeli IARF groups and Muslim participants made presentations. *In December 1914, just after World War I began, a group of Christians gathered in Cambridge, England to found the Fellowship of Reconciliation (FOR) \\"in hopes of bringing people of faith together to promote peace, and it went on to become a leading interfaith voice for non-violence and non-discrimination\\". It has branches and affiliated groups in over 50 countries on every continent. The membership includes \\"Jews, Christians, Buddhists, Muslims, Indigenous religious practitioners, Bah√° º√≠, and people of other faith traditions, as well as those with no formal religious affiliation\\". *In 1936, the World Congress of Faiths (WCF) formed in London. It is \\"one of the oldest interfaith bodies in the world\\". One of its purposes is to bring \\"people of faith together to enrich their understandings of their own and others' traditions\\". It does this by offering opportunities \\"to meet, explore, challenge and understand different faith traditions through events from small workshops to large conferences, partnership working, online conversation, and publications\\". *In 1949, following the devastation of World War II, the Fellowship In Prayer was founded in 1949 by Carl Allison Evans and Kathryn Brown. Evans believed that unified prayer would \\"bridge theological or structural religious differences,\\" would \\"open the mind and heart of the prayer to a new understanding of and appreciation for the beliefs and values of those following different spiritual paths,\\" and would \\"advance interfaith understanding and mutual respect among religious traditions,\\" *In 1952, the International Humanist and Ethical Union (IHEU) was founded in Amsterdam. It serves as \\"the sole world umbrella organisation embracing Humanist, atheist, rationalist, secularist, skeptic, laique, ethical cultural, freethought and similar organisations world-wide\\". IHEU's \\"vision is a Humanist world; a world in which human rights are respected and everyone is able to live a life of dignity\\". It implements its vision by seeking \\"to influence international policy through representation and information, to build the humanist network, and let the world know about the worldview of Humanism\\". *In 1958, the Center for the Study of World Religions (CSWR) at Harvard Divinity School (HDS) began. Since then, it \\"has been at the forefront of promoting the sympathetic study and understanding of world religions. It has supported academic inquiry and international understanding in this field through its residential community,\\" and \\"its research efforts and funding, and its public programs and publications\\". *In 1960, Juliet Hollister (1916‚Äì2000) created the Temple of Understanding (TOU) to provide \\"interfaith education\\" with the purpose of \\"breaking down prejudicial boundaries\\". The Temple of Understanding \\"over several years hosted meetings that paved the way for the North American Interfaith Network (NAIN)\\". *In the late 1960s, interfaith groups such as the Clergy And Laity Concerned (CALC) joined around Civil Rights issues for African-Americans and later were often vocal in their opposition to the Vietnam War.Give Peace a Chance: Exploring the Vietnam Antiwar Movement *In 1965, \\"about 100 Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish clergy\\" formed Clergy Concerned about Vietnam (CCAV).

To do this, Pope Paul VI established a special secretariat (later a pontifical council) for relationships with non-Christians. The papal encyclical Ecclesiam Suam emphasized the importance of positive encounter between Christians and people of other faith traditions. The Declaration on the Relationship of the Church to Non-Christian Religions (Nostra Aetate) of 1965, spelled out the pastoral dimensions of this relationship. *In 1967, the World Council of Churches conference \\"proved to be a landmark both as the beginning of serious interest in interfaith dialogue as such in the WCC, and as the first involvement in the ecumenical discussion of the Vatican Secretariat for Non-Christians\\". *In 1970, the first World Conference of Religions for Peace was held in Kyoto, Japan. Religions for Peace is \\"the world's largest and most representative multi-religious coalition advancing common action for peace\\".

The Pluralism Project posts the information on the Pluralism Project website. C*In 1993, on the centennial of its first conference, the Council for a Parliament of the World's Religions hosted a conference in Chicago with 8,000 participants from faith backgrounds around the world. \\"The Parliament is the oldest, the largest, and the most inclusive gathering of people of all faith and traditions.\\" The organization hosts meetings around the world every few years. Its 2015 conference decided to hold meetings every two years. *In 1994, the Interfaith Alliance was created \\"to celebrate religious freedom and to challenge the bigotry and hatred arising from religious and political extremism infiltrating American politics\\". As of 2016, the Interfaith Alliance has 185,000 members across the country made up of 75 faith traditions as well as those of no faith tradition. The Interfaith Alliance works to (1) \\"respect the inherent rights of all individuals‚Äìas well as their differences\\", (2) \\"promote policies that protect vital boundaries between religion and government\\", and (3) \\"unite diverse voices to challenge extremism and build common ground\\". *In 1995, the Interfaith Center at the Presidio was founded with \\"a multi-faith Board\\". The Center is a San Francisco Bay Area \\"interfaith friendship-building\\" that welcomes \\"people of all faiths\\". The Center is committed to \\"healing and peacemaking within, between, and among religious and spiritual traditions\\". * In 1996, the Center for Interfaith Relations in Louisville, Kentucky established the Festival of Faiths, a multi-day event that promotes interfaith understanding, cooperation and action.Hershberg, Ben Z. ‚ÄúReligious Gathering Hailed as Model.‚Äù The Courier-Journal, 18 Nov. 1996, p. 9 *In 1996, Kim Bobo founded the Interfaith Worker Justice (IWJ) organization.

James Parks Morton, former Dean of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine. ICNY's historic partners have included the New York State Unified Court System, Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York, UJA-Federation of New York, the Center for Court Innovation, the Harlem Community Justice Center, CONNECT and the city's nine Social Work Schools. ICNY works with hundreds of grassroots and immigrant religious leaders from fifteen different faith and ethnic traditions. Its \\"long-term goal is to help New York City become a nationally and internationally-recognized model for mutual understanding and cooperation among faith traditions\\". *In 1998, the Muslim Christian Dialogue Forum was formed \\"to promote religious tolerance between Muslims and Christians so that they could work for the promotion of peace, human rights, and democracy\\". On December 8, 2015, the Forum sponsored a seminar on the subject of \\"Peace on Earth\\" at the Forman Christian College. The purpose was to bring the Muslim and Christian communities together to defeat \\"terrorism and extremism\\". *In 1998, Interfaith Power & Light (IPL) began as a project of the Episcopal Church's Grace Cathedral, San Francisco, California. Building on its initial success, the IPL model has \\"been adopted by 40 state affiliates\\", and IPL is \\"working to establish Interfaith Power & Light programs in every state\\". Ecological sustainability is central to IPL's \\"faith-based activism\\".

In particular, the Forum is interested in \\"pluralism, peace building and conflict resolution, intercultural and interfaith dialogue, social harmony and justice, civil rights and community cohesion\\". ===21st- century initiatives=== *In 2000, the United Religions Initiative (URI) was founded \\"to promote enduring, daily interfaith cooperation, to end religiously motivated violence and to create cultures of peace, justice and healing for the Earth and all living beings\\". It now claims \\"more than 790 member groups and organizations, called Cooperation Circles, to engage in community action such as conflict resolution and reconciliation, environmental sustainability, education, women's and youth programs, and advocacy for human rights\\". *In 2001, after the September 11 attacks, \\"interfaith relations proliferated\\".Anny Bakalian and Medhi Bozorgmehr, Backlash 9/11: Middle Eastern and Muslim Americans Respond (University of California Press, 2009), 230. \\"Conversations about the urgency of interfaith dialogue and the need to be knowledgeable about the faith of others gained traction in new ways.\\" *In 2001, the Children of Abraham Institute (\\"CHAI\\") was founded \\"to articulate the 'hermeneutics of peace' ... that might be applied to bringing Jewish, Muslim, and Christian religious, social, and political leaders into shared study not only of the texts of Scripture but also of the paths and actions of peace that those texts demand\\". *In 2001, the Interfaith Encounter Association (IEA) was established in Israel. Its impetus dates from the late 1950s in Israel when a group of visionaries (which included Martin Buber) recognised the need for interfaith dialogue. IEA is dedicated to promoting \\"coexistence in the Middle East through cross-cultural study and inter-religious dialogue\\". It forms and maintains \\"on-going interfaith encounter groups, or centers, that bring together neighboring communities across the country. Each center is led by an interfaith coordinating team with one person for each community in the area.\\" *In 2002 the Messiah Foundation International was formed as \\"an interfaith, non-religious, spiritual organisation\\". The organisation comprises \\"people belonging to various religions and faiths\\" who \\"strive to bring about widespread divine love and global peace\\". *In 2002, the World Council of Religious Leaders (WCRL) was launched in Bangkok. It is \\"an independent body\\" that brings religious resources to support the work of the United Nations and its agencies around the world, nation states and other international organizations, in the \\"quest for peace\\". It offers \\"the collective wisdom and resources of the faith traditions toward the resolution of critical global problems\\". The WCRL is not a part of the United Nations. *In 2002, Eboo Patel, a Muslim, started the Interfaith Youth Core (IFYC) with a Jewish friend and an evangelical Christian staff worker. The IYYC was started to bring students of different religions \\"together not just to talk, but to work together to feed the hungry, tutor children or build housing\\". The IFYC builds religious pluralism by \\"respect for people's diverse religious and non-religious identities\\" and \\"common action for the common good\\". *In 2003, the Jordanian Interfaith Coexistence Research Center (JICRC) was founded by The Very Reverend Father Nabil Haddad. It \\"focuses on grassroots interfaith dialogue and coexistence\\". JICRC provides \\"advice to government and non-government organizations and individual decision makers regarding questions of inter- religious understanding\\" and \\"participates in interfaith efforts on the local, regional, and international levels\\". *In 2006, the Coexist Foundation was established. Its mission is \\"to advance social cohesion through education and innovation\\" and \\"to strengthen the bond that holds a society together through a sustainable model of people working and learning together\\" in order to reduce \\"prejudice, hate and violence\\". *In 2007, the Greater Kansas City Festival of Faiths put on its first festival. The festival's goals include: increased participation in interfaith experience and fostering dialogue. Festivals include dramatic events and speakers to \\"expand interaction and appreciation for different worldviews and religious traditions\\" One-third of the attendees are 'first-timers' to any interfaith activity. *On October 13, 2007 Muslims expanded their message. In A Common Word Between Us and You, 138 Muslim scholars, clerics and intellectuals unanimously came together for the first time since the days of the Prophet[s] to declare the common ground between Christianity and Islam. *In 2007, the biennial interfaith Insight Film Festival began. It encourages \\"filmmakers throughout the world to make films about 'faith'\\". The Festival invites \\"participants from all faith backgrounds\\" as a way contributing \\"to understanding, respect and community cohesion\\". *In 2008, Rabbi Shlomo Riskin established the Center for Jewish-Christian Understanding and Cooperation (CJCUC). The center was founded to \\"begin a theological dialogue\\" between Jews and Christians with the belief that in dialogue the two faiths will \\"find far more which unites\\" them than divides them.CJCUC Statement on a Jewish Understanding of Christians and Christianity - Council of Centers on Jewish-Christian Relations - May 24, 2011] and Shaping the Future of Dialogue . Retrieved August 6, 2016. The center, currently located at the Bible Lands Museum in Jerusalem, engages in Hebraic Bible Study for Christians, from both the local community and from abroad, has organized numerous interfaith praise initiatives, such as Day to Praise, and has established many fund-raising initiatives such as Blessing Bethlehem which aim to aid the persecuted Christian community of Bethlehem, in part, and the larger persecuted Christian community of the Middle East region and throughout the world. *In 2008, through the collaboration of the Hebrew Union College, Omar Ibn Al-Khattab Foundation, and the University of Southern California, the Center for Muslim-Jewish Engagement was created. The Center was \\"inspired by USC President Steven B. Sample's vision of increasing collaboration between neighboring institutions in order to benefit both the university and the surrounding community\\". Its mission is \\"to promote dialogue, understanding and grassroots, congregational and academic partnerships among the oldest and the newest of the Abrahamic faiths while generating a contemporary understanding in this understudied area and creating new tools for interfaith communities locally, nationally and beyond.\\" *July 2008 ‚Äì A historic interfaith dialogue conference was initiated by King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia to solve world problems through concord instead of conflict. The conference was attended by religious leaders of different faiths such as Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism, Hinduism, and Taoism and was hosted by King Juan Carlos of Spain in Madrid. *January 2009, at Gujarat's Mahuva, the Dalai Lama inaugurated an interfaith \\"World Religions-Dialogue and Symphony\\" conference convened by Hindu preacher Morari Bapu from January 6 to 11, 2009. This conference explored ways and means to deal with the discord among major religions, according to Morari Bapu. Participants included Prof. Samdhong Rinpoche on Buddhism, Diwan Saiyad Zainul Abedin Ali Sahib (Ajmer Sharif) on Islam, Dr. Prabalkant Dutt on non- Catholic Christianity, Swami Jayendra Saraswathi on Hinduism and Dastur Dr. Peshtan Hormazadiar Mirza on Zoroastrianism. *In 2009, the Vancouver School of Theology opened the Iona Pacific Inter-religious Centre.

The Charter was inspired by Karen Armstrong when she received the 2008 TED Prize. She made a wish that the TED community would \\"help create, launch, and propagate a Charter for Compassion\\". After the contribution of thousands of people the Charter was compiled and presented. Charter for Compassion International serves as \\"an umbrella for people to engage in collaborative partnerships worldwide\\" by \\"concrete, practical actions\\". *In 2009, Council of Interfaith Communities (CIC) was incorporated in Washington, District of Columbia. It mission was \\"to be the administrative and ecclesiastical home for independent interfaith/multifaith churches, congregations and seminaries in the USA\\" and to honor \\"Interfaith as a spiritual expression\\". The CIC is one component of the World Council of Interfaith Communities. *In 2010, Project Interfaith began its work. 35 volunteers began recording interviews with people in Omaha, Nebraska. Working in pairs, the volunteers were paired up and given a Flip Video camera to record the interviews. The interviewees were asked three questions: (1) \\"How do you identify yourself spiritually and why?,\\" (2) \\"What is a stereotype that impacts you based on your religious and spiritual identity?,\\" and (3) \\"How welcoming do you find our community for your religious or spiritual path?\\" The recorded interviews were posted on social media sites, like Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, and YouTube. Project Interfaith terminated in 2015. *In 2010, the Interfaith Center for Sustainable Development (ICSD) was established. ICSD is the largest interfaith environmental organization in the Middle East. Its work is bringing together \\"faith groups, religious leaders, and teachers to promote peace and sustainability\\". *In 2011, President Obama issued the Interfaith and Community Service Campus Challenge by sending a letter to all presidents of institutions of higher education in the United States. The goals of the Challenge included maximizing \\"the education contributions of community-based organizations, including faith and interfaith organizations\\". By 2015, more than 400 institutions of higher education had responded to the Challenge. In the 2015 Annual President's Interfaith and Community Service Campus Challenge Gathering, international participants were hosted for the first time. *In 2012, the King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz International Centre for Interreligious and Intercultural Dialogue (KAICIID) opened in Vienna, Austria. The board of directors included Jews, Christians, and Muslims. A rabbi on the board said that \\"the prime purpose is to empower the active work of those in the field, whether in the field of dialogue, of social activism or of conflict resolution\\". A Muslim member of the board said that \\"the aim is to promote acceptance of other cultures, moderation and tolerance\\". According to KAICIID officials, \\"the center is independent and would not be promoting any one religion\\". *In February 2016, the International Partnership on Religion and Sustainable Development (PaRD) was launched at the ‚ÄòPartners for Change‚Äô conference in Berlin. The network connects government bodies, faith-based organisations and civil-society agencies from around the world to encourage communication on religion and sustainable development.Dembowski, Hans; Nitschke, Ulrich. \\"The ambivalence of religions\\", D+C - Development + Cooperation, 20 October 2019. *In 2016, the National Catholic Muslim Dialogue (NCMD) was established in the United States. This is a joint venture between the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB), the Islamic Society of North America, the Islamic Circle of North America, Islamic Shura Council of Southern California, and the Islamic Educational Center of Orange County. The NCMD was an outgrowth of longstanding regional dialogues in the United States co-sponsored by the USCCB and their regional partners. *In February 2017, Sister Lucy Kurien, founder of Maher NGO, founded the Interfaith Association for Service to Humanity and Nature in Pune, India. She defines interfaith spirituality as, \\"We respect and love all religions. We never put down anyone‚Äôs religion, or uphold one religion to the exclusion of others. What we want is to believe and respect interfaith religion, inclusive of all faith traditions. In our community spiritual practices, we invoke our prayers to the Divine, rather than invoking any particular name or form of God to the exclusion of others.\\" As of October 2017, this new community has 198 members from 8 countries.

Nevertheless, the article expressed hope that continuing \\"interfaith dialogue can change this\\". ==Policies of religions== A PhD thesis Dialogue Between Christians, Jews and Muslims argues that \\"the paramount need is for barriers against non-defensive dialogue conversations between Christians, Jews, and Muslims to be dismantled to facilitate development of common understandings on matters that are deeply divisive\\". As of 2012, the thesis says that this has not been done.Ian Rex Fry, Dialogue Between Christians, Jews and Muslims (PhD Thesis, 2012), 37, 333. Retrieved July 3, 2016. ===Bah√° º√≠ Faith=== Interfaith and multi-faith interactivity is integral to the teachings of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith. Its founder Bah√°'u'll√°h enjoined his followers to \\"consort with the followers of all religions in a spirit of friendliness and fellowship\\".Tablets of Bah√°'u'll√°h, page 22 , Bah√°'u'll√°h, From the \\"Bish√°r√°t\\" (Glad-Tidings). Bah√° º√≠s are often at the forefront of local inter-faith activities and efforts. Through the Bah√° º√≠ International Community agency, the Bah√° º√≠s also participate at a global level in inter- religious dialogue both through and outside of the United Nations processes. In 2002 the Universal House of Justice, the global governing body of the Bah√° º√≠s, issued a letter to the religious leadership of all faiths in which it identified religious prejudice as one of the last remaining \\"isms\\" to be overcome, enjoining such leaders to unite in an effort to root out extreme and divisive religious intolerance. ===Buddhism=== Buddhism has historically been open to other religions. As Ven. Dr. K. Sri Dhammananda has stated: The fourteenth century Zen master Gasan Joseki indicated that the Gospels were written by an enlightened being: :\\"And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow. They toil not, neither do they spin, and yet I say unto you that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these...Take therefore no thought for the morrow, for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself.\\" :Gasan said: \\"Whoever uttered those words I consider an enlightened man.\\"101 Zen Stories; #16 The 14th Dalai Lama has done a great deal of interfaith work throughout his life. He believes that the \\"common aim of all religions, an aim that everyone must try to find, is to foster tolerance, altruism and love\\". He met with Pope Paul VI at the Vatican in 1973. He met with Pope John Paul II in 1980 and also later in 1982, 1986, 1988, 1990, and 2003. During 1990, he met in Dharamsala with a delegation of Jewish teachers for an extensive interfaith dialogue.Kamenetz, Rodger (1994)The Jew in the Lotus Harper Collins: 1994. He has since visited Israel three times and met during 2006 with the Chief Rabbi of Israel. In 2006, he met privately with Pope Benedict XVI. He has also met the late Archbishop of Canterbury Dr. Robert Runcie, and other leaders of the Anglican Church in London, Gordon B. Hinckley, late President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons), as well as senior Eastern Orthodox Church, Muslim, Hindu, Jewish, and Sikh officials. In 2010, the Dalai Lama was joined by Rev. Katharine Jefferts Schori, presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church, Chief Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks of the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth, and Islamic scholar Professor Seyyed Hossein Nasr of George Washington University when Emory University's Center for the Study of Law and Religion hosted a \\"Summit on Happiness\\". ===Christianity=== Traditional Christian doctrine is Christocentric, meaning that Christ is held to be the sole full and true revelation of the will of God for humanity. In a Christocentric view, the elements of truth in other religions are understood in relation to the fullness of truth found in Christ. God is nevertheless understood to be free of human constructions. Therefore, God the Holy Spirit is understood as the power who guides non-Christians in their search for truth, which is held to be a search for the mind of Christ, even if \\"anonymously,\\" in the phrase of Catholic theologian Karl Rahner. For those who support this view, anonymous Christians belong to Christ now and forever and lead a life fit for Jesus' commandment to love, even though they never explicitly understand the meaning of their life in Christian terms. While the conciliar document Nostra aetate has fostered widespread dialogue, the declaration Dominus Iesus nevertheless reaffirms the centrality of the person of Jesus Christ in the spiritual and cultural identity of Christians, rejecting various forms of syncretism. Pope John Paul II was a major advocate of interfaith dialogue, promoting meetings in Assisi in the 1980s. Pope Benedict XVI took a more moderate and cautious approach, stressing the need for intercultural dialogue, but reasserting Christian theological identity in the revelation of Jesus of Nazareth in a book published with Marcello Pera in 2004. In 2013, Pope Francis became the first Catholic leader to call for \\"sincere and rigorous\\" interbelief dialogue with atheists, both to counter the assertion that Christianity is necessarily an \\"expression of darkness of superstition that is opposed to the light of reason,\\" and to assert that \\"dialogue is not a secondary accessory of the existence of the believer\\" but instead is a \\"profound and indispensable expression ... [of] faith [that] is not intransigent, but grows in coexistence that respects the other.\\"\\"Pope urges dialogue with nonbelievers in letter to high profile atheist,\\" Francis X. Rocca, Catholic Herald, September 12, 2013 . Retrieved August 5, 2014.\\"Pope Francis' Letter to the Founder of 'La Repubblica' Italian Newspaper,\\" Vatican City, September 11, 2013 . Retrieved August 5, 2014. In traditional Christian doctrine, the value of inter-religious dialogue had been confined to acts of love and understanding toward others either as anonymous Christians or as potential converts. In mainline liberal Protestant traditions, however, as well as in the emerging church, these doctrinal constraints have largely been cast off. Many theologians, pastors, and lay people from these traditions do not hold to uniquely Christocentric understandings of how God was in Christ. They engage deeply in interfaith dialogue as learners, not converters, and desire to celebrate as fully as possible the many paths to God. Much focus in Christian interfaith dialogue has been put on Christian‚ÄìJewish reconciliation. One of the oldest successful dialogues between Jews and Christians has been taking place in Mobile, Alabama. It began in the wake of the call of the Second Vatican Council (1962‚Äì1965) of the Roman Catholic Church for increased understanding between Christians and Jews. The organization has recently moved its center of activity to Spring Hill College, a Catholic Jesuit institution of higher learning located in Mobile. Reconciliation has been successful on many levels, but has been somewhat complicated by the Arab-Israeli conflict in the Middle East, where a significant minority of Arabs are Christian. ===Judaism=== The Modern Orthodox movement allows narrow exchanges on social issues, while warning to be cautious in discussion of doctrine. Reform Judaism, Reconstructionist Judaism and Conservative Judaism encourage interfaith dialogue. Building positive relations between Jews and members of other religious communities has been an integral component of Reform Judaism's \\"DNA\\" since the movement was founded in Germany during the early 19th century, according to Rabbi A. James Rudin. It began with Israel Jacobson, a layman and pioneer in the development of what emerged as Reform Judaism, who established an innovative religious school in Sessen, Germany in 1801 that initially had 40 Jewish and 20 Christian students. \\"Jacobson's innovation of a 'mixed' student body reflected his hopes for a radiant future between Jews and Christians.\\" Moravian born Rabbi Isaac Mayer Wise, who founded the Reform movement in the United States, sought close relations with Christian church leaders. To that end, he published a series of lectures in 1883 entitled \\"Judaism and Christianity: Their Agreements and Disagreements\\". Wise emphasized what he believed linked the two religions in an inextricable theological and human bond: the biblical \\"Sinaitic revelation\\" as \\"... the acknowledged law of God\\". Rabbi Leo Baeck, the leader of the German Jewish community who survived his incarceration in the Terezin concentration camp, offered these words in his 1949 presidential address to the World Union for Progressive Judaism in London: \\"...as in a great period of the Middle Ages, [Jews and Muslims] are ...almost compelled to face each other... not only in the sphere of policy [the State of Israel in the Middle East], but also in the sphere of religion; there is the great hope... they will ...meet each other on joint roads, in joint tasks, in joint confidences in the future. There is the great hope that Judaism can thus become the builder of a bridge, the 'pontifex' between East and West.\\" In the 1950s and 60s, as interfaith civic partnerships between Jews and Christians in the United States became more numerous, especially in the suburbs, the Union of American Hebrew Congregations (now the Union for Reform Judaism, URJ) created a department mainly to promote positive Christian-Jewish relations and civic partnerships. Interfaith relations have since been expanded to include Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, and members of other faith communities. In 2013, Rabbi Marc Schneier and Imam Shamsi Ali coauthored a book Sons of Abraham: A Candid Conversation about the Issues That Divide and Unite Jews and Muslims.Rabbi Marc Schneier and Imam Shamsi Ali, Sons of Abraham: A Candid Conversation about the Issues That Divide and Unite Jews and Muslims (Beacon Press, 2013). Schneier and Ali write about the importance of civil interfaith discussions. Based on their experience, Schneier and Ali believe that other \\"Jews and Muslims can realize that they are actually more united than divided in their core beliefs\\". Interests in interfaith relations require an awareness of the range of Jewish views on such subjects as mission and the holy land. ===Islam=== Islam has long encouraged dialogue to reach truth. Dialogue is particularly encouraged amongst the People of the Book (Jews, Christians and Muslims) as Qur'an states, \\"Say, \\"O People of the Scripture, come to a word that is equitable between us and you ‚Äì that we will not worship except Allah and not associate anything with Him and not take one another as lords instead of Allah.\\" But if they turn away, then say, \\"Bear witness that we are Muslims [submitting to Him]\\" [3:64]. , Quran Surah Aal-i-Imraan ( Verse 64 ) Many traditional and religious texts and customs of the faith have encouraged this, including specific verses in the Quran, such as: \\"O people! Behold, we have created you from a male and a female and have made you into nations and tribes so that you might come to know one another. Verily, the noblest of you in the sight of God is the one who is most deeply conscious of Him. Behold, God is all-knowing, all-aware\\" [Qur'an 49:13]. In recent times, Muslim theologians have advocated inter-faith dialogue on a large scale, something which is new in a political sense. The declaration A Common Word of 2007 was a public first in Christian-Islam relations, trying to work out a moral common ground on many social issues. This common ground was stated as \\"part of the very foundational principles of both faiths: love of the One God, and love of the neighbour\\". The declaration asserted that \\"these principles are found over and over again in the sacred texts of Islam and Christianity\\". Relations between Muslims and Jews remain quite difficult, exacerbated by the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict. There are inter-Muslim issues in between Sunnis and Shiites that are very much unresolved in the Middle East. Also, relations between Muslims and Hindus in India and Pakistan have included tension. ;Interfaith dialogue integral to Islam A 2003 book called Progressive Muslims: On Justice, Gender, and Pluralism contains a chapter by Amir Hussain on \\"Muslims, Pluralism, and Interfaith Dialogue\\" in which he shows how interfaith dialogue has been an integral part of Islam from its beginning. Hussain writes that \\"Islam would not have developed if it had not been for interfaith dialogue\\". From his \\"first revelation\\" for the rest of his life, Muhammad was \\"engaged in interfaith dialogue\\" and \\"pluralism and interfaith dialogue\\" have always been important to Islam. For example, when some of Muhammad's followers suffered \\"physical persecution\\" in Mecca, he sent them to Abyssinia, a Christian nation, where they were \\"welcomed and accepted\\" by the Christian king. Another example is C√≥rdoba, Andalusia in Muslim Spain, in the ninth and tenth centuries. C√≥rdoba was \\"one of the most important cities in the history of the world\\". In it, \\"Christians and Jews were involved in the Royal Court and the intellectual life of the city\\". Thus, there is \\"a history of Muslims, Jews, Christians, and other religious traditions living together in a pluralistic society\\".Amir Hussain, \\"Muslims, Pluralism, and Interfaith Dialogue,\\" in Progressive Muslims: On Justice, Gender, and Pluralism, ed. Omid Safi, 252‚Äì255 (Oneworld Publications, 2003). Turning to the present, Hussain writes that in spite of Islam's history of \\"pluralism and interfaith dialogue\\", Muslims now face the challenge of conflicting passages in the Qur'an some of which support interfaith \\"bridge-building\\", but others can be used \\"justify mutual exclusion\\".Amir Hussain, \\"Muslims, Pluralism, and Interfaith Dialogue,\\" in Progressive Muslims: On Justice, Gender, and Pluralism, ed. Omid Safi, 254 (Oneworld Publications, 2003). In October 2010, as a representative of Shia Islam, Ayatollah Mostafa Mohaghegh Damad, professor at the Shahid Beheshti University of Tehran, addressed the Special Assembly for the Middle East of the Synod of Catholic Bishops. In the address he spoke about \\"the rapport between Islam and Christianity\\" that has existed throughout the history of Islam as one of \\"friendship, respect and mutual understanding\\". ;Book about Jewish‚ÄìMuslim dialogue In 2013, Rabbi Marc Schneier (Jewish) and Imam Shamsi Ali (Muslim) coauthored a book Sons of Abraham with the subtitle A Candid Conversation about the Issues That Divide and Unite Jews and Muslims. As Rabbi Marc Schneier and Imam Shamsi Ali show, \\"by reaching a fuller understanding of one another's faith traditions, Jews and Muslims can realize that they are actually more united than divided in their core beliefs\\". By their fuller understanding, they became \\"defenders of each other's religion, denouncing the twin threats of anti-Semitism and Islamophobia and promoting interfaith cooperation\\".Penguin-Randomhouse description of the book . In the book, regarding the state of Jewish-Muslim dialogue, although Rabbi Schneier acknowledges a \\"tremendous growth\\", he does not think that \\"we are where we want to be\\".Rabbi Marc Schneier and Imam Shamsi Ali, Sons of Abraham: A Candid Conversation about the Issues That Divide and Unite Jews and Muslims (Beacon Press, 2013), 180.

Retrieved October 17, 2016. According to the Ahmadiyya understanding, interfaith dialogues are an integral part of developing inter-religious peace and the establishment of peace. The Ahmadiyya Community has been organising interfaith events locally and nationally in various parts of the world in order to develop a better atmosphere of love and understanding between faiths. Various speakers are invited to deliver a talk on how peace can be established from their own or religious perspectives. ===Zoroastrianism=== Zoroastrianism has long encouraged interfaith, all the way from Cyrus the Great's speech in Babylon, which permitted the population to keep following their own religion and keep speaking their own language. Cyrus did not enforce the state religion unto the people. As well, Cyrus freed all the Jewish slaves from Babylon, which earned him a place in the Jewish scriptures. Zoroastrians believe that all religions are equal, and that their religion is not superior to other religions. They believed that the Prophet Zoroaster implied the religion unto them, and did not convert each of them. Therefore, they do not even accept converts into their religion. All adherents must be born into the religion. ==Preconditions== In her 2008 book The Im-Possibility of Interreligious Dialogue, Catherine Cornille outlines her preconditions for \\"constructive and enriching dialogue between religions\\".Catherine Cornille, The Im-Possibility of Interreligious Dialogue (Crossroad Publishing Company, 2008). Retrieved August 1, 2016. In summary, they include \\"doctrinal humility, commitment to a particular religion, interconnection, empathy, and hospitality\\".

Breaking down the walls that divides faiths while respecting the uniqueness of each tradition requires the courageous embrace of all these preconditions.Balcomb, Michael W. \\"Religion As An Obstacle To Peace?.\\" Dialogue & Alliance 26.2 (2012): 40-49. ATLA Religion Database with ATLASerials. Web. 10 Feb. 2015. In 2016, President Obama made two speeches that outlined preconditions for meaningful interfaith dialogue: On February 3, 2016, he spoke at the Islamic Society of Baltimore and on February 4, 2016, at the National Prayer Breakfast. The eight principles of interfaith relations as outlined by Obama were as follows: #Relationship building requires visiting each other. #Relationship requires learning about the others' history. #Relationship requires an appreciation of the other. #Relationship requires telling the truth. #Relationships depend on living up to our core theological principles and values. #Relationships offer a clear-headed understanding of our enemies. #Relationships help us overcome fear. #Relationship requires solidarity. ==United Nations support== The United Nations Alliance of Civilizations is an initiative to prevent violence and support social cohesion by promoting intercultural and interfaith dialogue. The UNAOC was proposed by the President of the Spanish Government, Jos√© Luis Rodr√≠guez Zapatero at the 59th General Assembly of the United Nations in 2005. It was co-sponsored by the Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan. In 2008, Anwarul Karim Chowdhury said: \\"Interfaith dialogue is absolutely essential, relevant, and necessary. ... If 2009 is to truly be the Year of Interfaith Cooperation, the U.N. urgently needs to appoint an interfaith representative at a senior level in the Secretariat.\\" The Republic of the Philippines will host a Special Non-Aligned Movement Ministerial Meeting on Interfaith Dialogue and Cooperation for Peace and Development from March 16 to 18 in Manila. During the meeting, to be attended by ministers of foreign affairs of the NAM member countries, a declaration in support of interfaith dialogue initiatives will be adopted. An accompanying event will involve civil society activities. In 2010, HM King Abdullah II addressed the 65th UN General Assembly and proposed the idea for a 'World Interfaith Harmony Week' to further broaden his goals of faith-driven world harmony by extending his call beyond the Muslim and Christian community to include people of all beliefs, those with no set religious beliefs as well. A few weeks later, HRH Prince Ghazi bin Muhammad presented the proposal to the UN General Assembly, where it was adopted unanimously as a UN Observance Event. The first week of February, every year, has been declared a UN World Interfaith Harmony Week. The Royal Islamic Strategic Studies Centre released a document which summarises the key events leading up to the UN resolution as well as documenting some Letters of Support and Events held in honour of the week. ==Criticism== The Islamist group Hizb ut-Tahrir rejects the concept of interfaith dialogue, stating that it is a western tool to enforce non-Islamic policies in the Islamic world. Many Traditionalist Catholics, not merely Sedevacantists or the Society of St. Pius X, are critical of interfaith dialogue as a harmful novelty arising after the Second Vatican Council, which is said to have altered the previous notion of the Catholic Church's supremacy over other religious groups or bodies, as well as demoted traditional practices associated with traditional Roman Catholicism. In addition, these Catholics contend that, for the sake of collegial peace, tolerance and mutual understanding, interreligious dialogue devalues the divinity of Jesus Christ and the revelation of the Triune God by placing Christianity on the same footing as other religions that worship other deities. Evangelical Christians also critical for dialogues with Catholics. Religious sociologist Peter L. Berger argued that one can reject interfaith dialogue on moral grounds in certain cases. The example he gave was that of a dialogue with imams who legitimate ISIS, saying such discussions ought to be avoided so as not to legitimate a morally repugnant theology.Berger, Peter. \\"A Jewish Take on Pluralism.\\" The American Interest. 11 January 2017. 1 February 2017. In the case of Hinduism, it has been argued that the so-called interfaith \\"dialogue ... has [in fact] become the harbinger of violence. This is not because 'outsiders' have studied Hinduism or because the Hindu participants are religious 'fundamentalists' but because of the logical requirements of such a dialogue\\". With a detailed analysis of \\"two examples from Hinduism studies\\", S.N. Balagangadhara and Sarah Claerhout argue that, \\"in certain dialogical situations, the requirements of reason conflict with the requirements of morality\\". The theological foundations of interreligious dialogue have also been critiqued on the grounds that any interpretation of another faith tradition will be predicated on a particular cultural, historical and anthropological perspective Some critics of interfaith dialogue may not object to dialogue itself, but instead are critical of specific events claiming to carry on the dialogue. For example, the French Algerian prelate Pierre Claverie was at times critical of formal inter-religious conferences between Christians and Muslims which he felt remained too basic and surface-level. He shunned those meetings since he believed them to be generators of slogans and for the glossing over of theological differences. However, he had such an excellent knowledge of Islam that the people of Oran called him \\"the Bishop of the Muslims\\" which was a title that must have pleased him since he had dreamed of establishing true dialogue among all believers irrespective of faith or creed. Claverie also believed that the Islamic faith was authentic in practice focusing on people rather than on theories. He said that: \\"dialogue is a work to which we must return without pause: it alone lets us disarm the fanaticism; both our own and that of the other\\". He also said that \\"Islam knows how to be tolerant\\". In 1974 he joined a branch of Cimade which was a French NGO dedicated to aiding the oppressed and minorities. ==See also== * A Common Word Between Us and You * Buddhism and Christianity * Buddhism and Hinduism * Buddhism and Jainism * Center for Jewish-Christian Understanding and Cooperation * Centre for Dialogue * Chrislam (Yoruba) * Daughters of Abraham * Ecumenism (Christian) * Esalen Institute * Fethullah G√ºlen * Galibi Order * Galip Hassan Kuscuoglu * G√ºlen movement * Intercultural dialogue * Interfaith Center of New York * International Center for Religion & Diplomacy * Jewish views of religious pluralism * Jordanian Interfaith Coexistence Research Center * KAICIID Dialogue Centre * List of founders of religious traditions * List of interreligious organizations * Multifaith space * Parliament of the World's Religions * Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue * Prince Alwaleed Center for Muslim‚ÄìChristian Understanding * Relations between Catholicism and Judaism * Religions for Peace * Roland de Corneille * Saltley Gate Peace Group * Scriptural Reasoning * Seventh-day Adventist interfaith relations * Subud * Tanenbaum Center for Interreligious Understanding * Temple of All Religions * Temple of Understanding * The Elijah Interfaith Institute * Union for Reform Judaism * United Religions Initiative * United States Institute of Peace * World Council of Churches * World Interfaith Harmony Week * World Religion Day ==References== ==Further reading== * Hick, John, ed.

The main settlement is Grytviken. South Georgia is 167.4 kilometres (104 mi) long and 1.4 to 37 km (0.9 to 23.0 miles) wide. It is about 830 km (520 mi) northeast of Coronation Island and 550 km (340 mi) northwest from Zavodovski Island, the nearest South Sandwich island. ==History== The Island of South Georgia is said to have been first sighted in 1675 by Anthony de la Roch√©, a London merchant, and was named Roche Island on a number of early maps. It was sighted by a commercial Spanish ship named Le√≥n operating out of Saint-Malo on 28 June or 29 June 1756. According to Argentine historians, it was explored on 29 June 1756, St. Peter's day, hence its Spanish name Isla San pedro, literally \\"St. Peter's Island\\". Commercial sealing was conducted on the island between 1786 and 1913. During that period 131 sealing visits are recorded, eight of which ended when the vessel was wrecked.R.K. Headland, (ed.) Historical Antarctic sealing industry, Scott Polar Research Institute (Cambridge University), 2018, p.168, . Modern industrial sealing associated with whaling stations was carried out between 1909 and 1964. Sealing era relics include iron trypots, hut ruins, graves and inscriptions. === Argentine occupation === On 19 March 1982, a group of Argentinians arrived at Leith Harbour and raised the Argentine flag on the island. On 3 April, the second day of the Falklands War, Argentine naval forces formally annexed the island. South Georgia was retaken by British forces on 25 April during Operation Paraquet. ==Geography and fauna== Topography of South Georgia Island Church at Grytviken The island is classified as an ET or polar tundra climate on the K√∂ppen-Geiger classification system. It has no tree cover, and there is generally snow on the island during the winter months (April‚ÄìNovember). The terrain is mountainous, with a central ridge and many fjords and bays along the coast. Additionally, South Georgia is a breeding ground for elephant seals,Boyd, I. L., Walker, T. R., & Poncet, J. (1996). Status of southern elephant seals at South Georgia. Antarctic Science, 8(3), 237‚Äì244. fur seals,Boyd, I. L., McCafferty, D. J., & Walker, T. R. (1997).

Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences, 55(4), 845‚Äì852. and king penguins. The island is home to the South Georgia Pintail and the South Georgia Pipit, the only known habitat for these birds. The island's topography includes a stepped sequence of flat surfaces interpreted as wave-cut platforms formed when sea level was higher relative to the island. At sea level strandflats have been described. In 2013, teams of Norwegian government shooters and Sami reindeer herders culled all 3,500 reindeer on the island. The animals had been introduced by Norwegian whalers in the early 20th century for food and sport hunting, but were later seen as a pest, damaging the island's flora and wider ecosystem. Karl Erik Kilander, the project manager, said the culled reindeer were frozen and taken to the Falkland Islands where they were sold to local residents and cruise ship operators. In 2018, after a multiyear extermination effort, the island was declared free of invasive rodents and the number of South Georgia Pipits had clearly increased. ==References== Category:Islands of South Georgia Category:Seal hunting ","title":"South Georgia Island"},{"id":"525308","text":"The Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (; IBGE) is the agency responsible for official collection of statistical, geographic, cartographic, geodetic and environmental information in Brazil. IBGE performs a decennial national census; questionnaires account for information such as age, household income, literacy, education, occupation and hygiene levels. IBGE is a public institute created in 1936 under the name National Institute of Statistics. Its founder and chief proponent was statistician M√°rio Augusto Teixeira de Freitas. The current name dates from 1938. Its headquarters are located in Rio de Janeiro, and its current president is Susana Cordeiro Guerra. It was made a federal agency by Decree-Law No. 161 on February 13, 1967, and is linked to the Ministry of the Economy, inside the Secretariat of Planning, Budget and Management. == Structure == IBGE has a network of national research and dissemination components, comprising: * 27 state units (26 in state capitals and one in the Federal District); * 27 centres for documentation and dissemination of information (26 in the capital and one in the Federal District); * 27 units for the supervision of territorial mapping (26 in the capital and one in the Federal District); * 585 data collection agencies in major cities. * Headquarters in Rio de Janeiro (Rio de Janeiro was the capital of the Republic when the Office was established). Also in Rio de Janeiro are five boards and a school: Executive Directors (ED), Directorate of Research (DPE), Department of Geosciences (DGC), Department of Informatics (DI), Center for Documentation and Information Dissemination (CDDI) and the National School of Statistical Sciences. The Directorate of Research is responsible for planning and coordinating the research of nature and processing of statistical data collected by the state units; the Department of Geosciences is responsible for basic cartography, the national geodetic system, with a survey of natural resources and environment and by survey and geographical studies. The Center for Documentation and Information Dissemination is responsible for documentation and dissemination of information produced by the institute as well as coordinating the 27 CDDIs in the country, and the National School of Statistical Sciences, besides being responsible for training the institute's employees, is a federal institution of higher learning that offers the following courses: BA in Statistics; specialization in Environmental Analysis and Management Planning, and Masters in Population Studies and Social Research. The IBGE also maintains the Roncador Ecological Reserve, situated 35 km south of Bras√≠lia. ==System of national accounts== Gives an overview of the economy and describes the phenomena of economic life: production, consumption and wealth accumulation, providing a comprehensive and simplified representation of these data. The System of National Accounts IBGE follows the most recent UN recommendations expressed in the Handbook of National Accounts (System of National Accounts 1993 , SNA), including the calculation of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and the Input-output matrix. ===Quarterly national accounts=== Displays the current value and volume indices (1991 = 100) every quarter for the Gross Domestic Product at market prices, taxes on products, value added at basic prices, personal consumption, government consumption, Gross fixed capital formation, changes in inventories, exports and imports of goods and services. Two series of index numbers are calculated: the basis of the previous year and chained with reference to 1990 (1990 = 100). The series is seasonally adjusted using X-12-ARIMA, enabling calculation of the rates of change over the previous quarter. The IBGE survey was started in 1988 and restructured after 1998, when their results were integrated into the current System of National Accounts. The annual weights are derived from this new system accounts. == Archives == IBGE maintains the following archives (non- exhaustive list): :* Municipal Agricultural Production (MAP) :* Municipal Livestock Survey (PPM) :* Extraction Plant and Forestry Research (PEVS) :* Annual Survey of Industry (full model) (PIA-C) :* Annual Survey of Industries (simplified form) (PIA-S) :* Annual Survey of Industries (product) (PIA-Prod) :* Annual Survey of Construction Industry (Paice) :* Annual Survey of Trade (simplified model) (PAC-S) :* Annual Survey of Trade (full model) (PAC-C) :* Annual Services Survey (PAS) :* Continuous National Sample Survey of Households (PNADC) :* Monthly Survey of Employment and Wages (PIMES) :* Monthly Industrial Survey of Physical Production (PIM -PF) :* Monthly Survey of Trade (PMC) :* Monthly Survey of Services (PMS) :* Household Budget Survey (POF) == Requirement and confidentiality of information == The legislation, according to Federal Decree No. 73,177 of November 20, 1973 and Law No. 5534 of November 14, 1968, modified by Law No. 5878 of May 11, 1978, deals with the obligation and confidentiality of information collected by IBGE, which is intended exclusively for statistical purposes and has no legal value, not being usable as evidence or proof. Failure to provide information within the specified deadlines, or providing false information is a crime subject to a fine, initially, of up to 10 times the highest minimum wage in the country, and up to twice this limit on later occasions. == Some economic indicators released by the IBGE == :* National System of Consumer Price Indices ::* National Index of Consumer Prices (INPC) ::* Broad National Consumer Price Index (IPCA) ::* National Index of Construction (INCC) ==CensusesDemographic census === The IBGE performs various kinds of censuses, although the best known is the population census (statistics on the population of the country). In Brazil, the population censuses are conducted every 10 years solely by the IBGE, as this is the body established by law as responsible for their production. The population count is made between the interval between two censuses, usually five years after the last five or before the next . Aims to update the data on the number of inhabitants, and is not always applied in all municipalities. The first population count was conducted in 1996, not only to update population data, but also to get municipality level data after the emergence and redefinition of new municipalities after the 1500 Population Census of 1991. After the census conducted in 2000, the IBGE population count conducted in 2007 which aimed to update the population estimates, but also incorporated the demographic changes occurring in the territory since the last survey of reference. The last demographic census was conducted in 2010, and the next one will be conducted in 2020. The population count is of great importance to Brazil's cities, because the annual grant of funds from the Municipalities Participation Fund is determined mainly by the estimates of population variation provided by IBGE, which directly influence the calculation of the coefficients used to transfer the fund to the municipalities. ===Agricultural census === The agricultural census collects information on agricultural establishments, forests and/or aquaculture of all municipalities of a country. The goal of this research is to update previous census data and to provide information about economic, social, and environmental farming. Since 1996, the census has occurred roughly every 10 years. The 1996 agricultural census was conducted by IBGE from August 1995 to July 1996, in reference to Brazil's crop harvests. The following agricultural census was undertaken in 2007, and surveyed agricultural activity for the 2006 calendar year. The 2017 agricultural census returned to a survey period based on crop harvests, and was conducted from October 2016 to September 2017, with results released in 2018. ==See also== *List of national mapping agencies *Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica ==References== ==External links== *IBGE website *ENCE - National School of Statistical Sciences Category:Demographics of Brazil Category:National statistical services Category:Government agencies of Brazil Category:Organisations based in Rio de Janeiro (city) Category:1967 establishments in Brazil ","title":"Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics"},{"id":"525309","text":"Marcus Sergius was a Roman general during the Second Punic War (218 to 201 BC). He is famed in prosthetics circles as the first documented user of a prosthetic hand. The metal hand was constructed to allow him to hold his shield in battle. A description of Marcus Sergius is found in the seventh book of Pliny's Natural History, published in AD 77: :Nobody - at least in my opinion - can rightly rank any man above Marcus Sergius, although his great- grandson Catiline shames his name. In his second campaign Sergius lost his right hand. In two campaigns he was wounded twenty-three times, with the result that he had no use in either hand or either foot: only his spirit remained intact. Although disabled, Sergius served in many subsequent campaigns. He was twice captured by Hannibal - no ordinary foe- from whom twice he escaped, although kept in chains and shackles every day for twenty months. He fought four times with only his left hand, while two horses he was riding were stabbed beneath him. :He had a right hand made of iron for him and, going into battle with this bound to his arm, raised the siege of Cremona, saved Placentia and captured twelve enemy camps in Gaul - all of which exploits were confirmed by the speech he made as praetor when his colleagues tried to debar him as infirm from the sacrifices.

Electronic edition, page 17. Graph theory itself is typically dated as beginning with Leonhard Euler's 1736 work on the Seven Bridges of K√∂nigsberg. However, drawings of complete bipartite graphs were already printed as early as 1669, in connection with an edition of the works of Ramon Llull edited by Athanasius Kircher.. Llull himself had made similar drawings of complete graphs three centuries earlier.. == Definition == A complete bipartite graph is a graph whose vertices can be partitioned into two subsets V1 and V2 such that no edge has both endpoints in the same subset, and every possible edge that could connect vertices in different subsets is part of the graph. That is, it is a bipartite graph (V1, V2, E) such that for every two vertices v1 ‚àà V1 and v2 ‚àà V2, v1v2 is an edge in E. A complete bipartite graph with partitions of size V1 = m and V2 = n, is denoted Km,n; every two graphs with the same notation are isomorphic. == Examples == star graphs K1,3, K1,4, K1,5, and K1,6. * For any k, K1,k is called a star. All complete bipartite graphs which are trees are stars. ** The graph K1,3 is called a claw, and is used to define the claw-free graphs.. Corrected reprint of the 1986 original. * The graph K3,3 is called the utility graph. This usage comes from a standard mathematical puzzle in which three utilities must each be connected to three buildings; it is impossible to solve without crossings due to the nonplanarity of K3,3.. * The maximal bicliques found as subgraphs of the digraph of a relation are called concepts. When a lattice is formed by taking meets and joins of these subgraphs, the relation has an Induced concept lattice. This type of analysis of relations is called formal concept analysis. == Properties == { class= align=right width=360 + Example Kp,p complete bipartite graphsCoxeter, Regular Complex Polytopes, second edition, p.114 !

It was also one of the largest wholesale supermarket of any kind. The market opened on 11 February 1935 as a replacement for an older market that was destroyed in the 1923 Great Kant≈ç earthquake. It closed on 6 October 2018 and moved to the new Toyosu Market, away. The market was located in Tsukiji in central Tokyo between the Sumida River and the upmarket Ginza shopping district. When the inner wholesale market was operational, it offered only restricted access to visitors. After the inner wholesale market closed, the outer retail market, restaurants, and associated restaurant supply stores remain operational and the area is still a major tourist attraction for both domestic and overseas visitors. ==Location== On the streets of Tsukiji as a tourist Cutting frozen tuna with a band saw The market is located near the Tsukijishij≈ç Station on the Toei ≈åedo Line and Tsukiji Station on the Tokyo Metro Hibiya Line. There are two distinct sections of the market as a whole. The inner market (j≈çnai-shij≈ç) was the licensed wholesale market, where approximately 900 licensed wholesale dealers operate small stalls and where the auctions and most of the processing of the fish take place. The outer market (j≈çgai-shij≈ç) is a mixture of wholesale and retail shops that sell Japanese kitchen tools, restaurant supplies, groceries, and seafood, and many restaurants, especially sushi restaurants. Most of the shops in the outer market closed by the early afternoon. In the inner market visitors were only allowed in by 10.00 am (11.00 pm by the time the market was moved), by which time the activity in the market had reduced significantly or almost ceased. A small number of visitors however were allowed into the inner market in the early morning to see the tuna auction. ==History== An oroshi hocho in use at the Tsukiji ===Origin=== The land on which the fish market sat was created during the Edo period by the Tokugawa shogunate after the Great fire of Meireki of 1657. It was created through land reclamation on the Tokyo Bay, and the area was therefore named Tsukiji (ÁØâÂú∞), meaning \\"constructed land\\" or \\"reclaimed land\\". The fish market however was not sited here until the 20th century. The first fish market in Tokyo was originally located in the Nihonbashi district, next to the Nihonbashi bridge that gave the area its name. The area was one of the earliest places to be settled when Edo (as Tokyo was known until the 1870s) was made the capital by Tokugawa Ieyasu, and the market provided food for the Edo castle built on a nearby hill. Tokugawa Ieyasu took a number of fishermen from Tsukuda, Osaka to Edo to provide fish for the castle in 1590. Fish not bought by the castle was then sold near the Nihonbashi bridge, at a market called uogashi (literally, \\"fish quay\\"). In August 1918, following the so-called Rice Riots (Kome S≈çd≈ç), which broke out in over 100 cities and towns in protest against food shortages and the speculative practices of wholesalers, the Japanese government was forced to create new institutions for the distribution of foodstuffs, especially in urban areas. A Central Wholesale Market Law was established in March 1923. The Great Kant≈ç earthquake on 1 September 1923 devastated much of central Tokyo, including the Nihonbashi fish market. The Tokyo government, which already had plans to relocate the market due to its unsanitary conditions considered unsuitable for an area that had developed into a business center, then took the opportunity to move the market to the Tsukiji district. ===Construction and opening=== Tsukiji Fish Market Following the 1923 Great Kant≈ç earthquake architects and engineers from the Architectural Section of Tokyo Municipal Government were sent to Europe and America to do research for the new market. However, because of the sheer size of the market and the number of items traded they were forced to come up with their own unique design. The quarter circular shape allowed easier access and handling for freight trains and the steel structure above allowed a wide, continuous space free from columns and subdivisions.'Spring 2005, \\"Do_co,mo.mo Japan: the 100 selection\\", The Japan Architect, No57, p54 The relocation of the market would be one of the biggest reconstruction projects in Tokyo after the earthquake, taking over six years involving 419,500 workers. Tsukiji was officially opened on February 11, 1935. After the modern market facility was completed in 1935, the fish market in Tsukiji began operations under the provisions of the 1923 Central Wholesale Market Law, along with two other major markets in Kanda and Koto. Smaller branch markets were established in Ebara, Toshima, and Adachi, and elsewhere. Tsukiji was part Tokyo Metropolitan Government's system of wholesale markets that included more than a dozen major and branch markets, handling seafood, produce, meat, and cut flowers. === Relocation to Toyosu Market === The Tsukiji fish market occupies valuable real estate close to the center of the city. Former Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara repeatedly called for moving the market to Toyosu, Koto. The long-anticipated move to the new Toyosu Market (Ë±äÊ¥≤Â∏ÇÂ†¥) was scheduled to take place in November 2016, in preparation for the 2020 Summer Olympics, but on August 31, 2016, the move was postponed. There had been concerns that new location was heavily polluted and needed to be cleaned up.Osumi, Magdalena Tsukiji workers demand answers over toxic soil at new site Feb 22, 2016 The Japan Times Retrieved February 23, 2016 There are plans to retain a retail market, roughly a quarter of the current operation, in Tsukiji. The remaining area of the market will be redeveloped.Ito, Masami, \\"Tsukiji countdown: clock ticking on famed fish market\\", Japan Times, 1 November 2015, p. 14 In June 2017, plans to move the fish market were restarted. but delayed in July to the autumn of 2018. On 3 August 2017, a fire broke out in some of the outer buildings. After the new site had been declared safe following a cleanup operation, the opening date of the new market was set for 11 October 2018. Tsukiji market closed on 6 October 2018, with the businesses of the inner market relocated to the new Toyosu Market between 6 and 11 October. Even though Tsukiji inner market has moved to Toyosu, the outer market remains, selling food and other goods. The former market will be used temporarily as a hub for transport vehicles during the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, after which it will be developed into a complex with a convention center, hotels, and other facilities by the 2040s. ==Economics== The market handled more than 480 different kinds of seafood as well as 270 types of other produce, ranging from cheap seaweed to the most expensive caviar, and from tiny sardines to 300 kg tuna and controversial whale species.Heller, Peter (2006) \\"The Whale Warriors: Whaling in the Antarctic Seas\\" National Geographic Adventure Overall, more than 700,000 metric tons of seafood are handled every year at the three seafood markets in Tokyo, with a total value in excess of 600 billion yen (approximately 5.4 billion US dollars in August 2018). At Tsukiji, around 1,628 tons of seafood worth 1.6 billion yen ($US14 million) may be sold on a typical day. There were around 900 licensed dealers at the market, and the number of registered employees varied from 60,000 to 65,000, including wholesalers, accountants, auctioneers, company officials, and distributors. ==Operations== The market opened most mornings (except Sundays, holidays and some Wednesdays) at 3:00 a.m. with the arrival of the products by ship, truck and plane from all over the world. Particularly impressive was the unloading of tons of frozen tuna. The auction houses (wholesalers known in Japanese as oroshi gy≈çsha) then estimate the value and prepare the incoming products for the auctions. The buyers (licensed to participate in the auctions) also inspected the fish to discern which they would like to bid for and at what price. The auctions started around 5:20 a.m. Bids can only be made by licensed participants. These bidders include intermediate wholesalers (nakaoroshi gy≈çsha) who operated stalls in the marketplace and other licensed buyers who were agents for restaurants, food processing companies, and large retailers. The auctions usually ended around 10:00 a.m. Afterward, the purchased fish was either loaded onto trucks to be shipped to the next destination or on small carts and moved to the many shops inside the market. There the shop owners cut and prepare the products for retail. In case of large fish, for example tuna and swordfish, cutting and preparation was elaborate. Frozen tuna and swordfish were often cut with large band saws, and fresh tuna is carved with extremely long knives (some well over a meter in length) called oroshi-h≈çch≈ç, maguro-b≈çch≈ç, or hanch≈ç-h≈çch≈ç.

They are: Kesh (uncut hair), Kangha (a wooden comb for the hair), Kara (an iron bracelet), Kachera (a 100% cotton tieable undergarment, must not be elastic), and Kirpan (an iron dagger large enough to defend oneself ) . The Five Ks are not just symbols, but articles of faith that collectively form the external identity and the Khalsa devotee's commitment to the Sikh rehni, \\"Sikh way of life\\". A Sikh who has taken Amrit and keeps all five Ks are known as Khalsa (\\"pure\\") or Amritdhari Sikh (\\"Amrit Sanskar participant\\"), while a Sikh who has not taken Amrit but follows the teachings of the Sri Guru Granth Sahib is called a Sahajdhari Sikh. ==Kesh== The Kesh also known as Kesa, or uncut, long hair, is considered by Sikhs as an indispensable part of the human body. Long known as a sign of spiritual devotion, it also emulates the appearance of Guru Gobind Singh and is one of the primary signs by which a Sikh can be clearly and quickly identified. A Sikh never cuts or trims any hair as a symbol of respect for the perfection of God's creation. The uncut long hair and the beard, in the case of men, form the main kakƒÅr for Sikhs. The turban is a spiritual crown, which is a constant reminder to the Sikh that they are sitting on the throne of consciousness and are committed to living according to Sikh principles. Guru Gobind Singh told his Sikhs: > \\"Khalsa mero roop hai khaas. Khalsa mai ho karo nivaas... The Khalsa is my > image. Within the Khalsa I reside.\\"As Khalsa, Wearing the Five K‚Äôs; Posted > March 30, 2016 by Sikh Dharma International Wearing a turban declares > sovereignty, dedication, self-respect, courage and piety. A noted figure in Sikh history is Bhai Taru Singh, who was martyred when he refused to get his Kesh cut. ==Kangha== Kangha ‚Äì one of the five articles of faith for the Sikhs A Kangha is a small wooden comb that Sikhs use twice a day. It is supposed to be worn only in the hair and at all times. Combs help to clean and remove tangles from the hair, and is a symbol of cleanliness. Combing their hair reminds Sikhs that their lives should be tidy and organized. The comb keeps the hair tidy, a symbol of not just accepting what God has given, but also an injunction to maintain it with grace. The Guru Granth Sahib said hair should be allowed to grow naturally; this precludes any shaving for both men and women. In the Guru's time, some holy men let their hair become tangled and dirty. The Guru said that this was not right; that hair should be allowed to grow but it should be kept clean and combed at least twice a day. ==Kara== Kara ‚Äì one of the five articles of faith for the Sikhs The Sikhs were commanded by Guru Gobind Singh at the Baisakhi Amrit Sanchar in 1699 to wear an iron bracelet called a Kara at all times. The Kara is a constant reminder to always remember that whatever a person does with their hands has to be in keeping with the advice given by the Guru. The Kara is an iron/steel circle to symbolise God as never ending. It is a symbol of permanent bonding to the community, of being a link in the chain of Khalsa Sikhs (the word for link is \\"kari\\"). ==Kachera== The Kachera is a shalwar- undergarment with a tie-knot worn by baptized Sikhs. Originally, the Kachera was made part of the five Ks as a symbol of a Sikh soldier's willingness to be ready at a moment's notice for battle or for defence. The confirmed Sikh (one who has taken the Amrit) wears a Kachera every day. Some go to the extent of wearing a Kacheraye while bathing, to be ready to at a moment's notice, changing into the new one a single leg at a time, so as to have no moment where they are unprepared. Further, this garment allowed the Sikh soldier to operate in combat freely and without any hindrance or restriction, because it was easy to fabricate, maintain, wash and carry compared to other traditional under-garments of that era, like the dhoti. The Kachera symbolises self- respect, and always reminds the wearer of mental control over lust, one of the Five Evils in Sikh philosophy. Kachera follow a generally practical and roomy design. It features an embedded string that circles the waist which can be tightened or loosened as desired, and then knotted securely. The Kachera can be classed between underwear and an outer garment, as in appearance it does not reveal private anatomy, and looks and wears like shorts. As with all of the Five Ks, there is equality between men and women, and so women are also expected to wear it. Considering the hot climate in India, the Kachera is often worn by men as an outer garment, keeping the wearer cool and being practical in manual work such as farming, but it is generally not considered respectful for women to wear the Kachera as an outer garment (on its own) as it is considered too revealing. ==Kirpan== Kirpan The Kirpan is a dagger which symbolises a Sikh's duty to come to the defence of those in peril. All Sikhs should wear kirpan on their body at all times as a defensive side-arm, just as a police officer is expected to wear a side-arm when on duty. Its use is only allowed in the act of self-defense and the protection of others. It stands for bravery and protecting the weak and innocent. The kirpan is kept sharp and is actually used to defend others, such as those who are oppressed by harsh rulers, or a person who is being robbed, raped, or beaten. The true Sikh cannot turn a blind eye to such evils, thinking that they are \\"someone else's concern.\\" It is the duty of the true Sikh to help those who suffer unjustly, by whatever means available, whether that means alerting the police, summoning help, or literally defending those who cannot defend themselves, even if that means putting oneself in harm's way. ==See also== * Sikhism * Amrit Sanchar ‚Äì baptism ceremony * Vaisakhi * Khalsa and Sahajdhari * Gursikh * Amritdhari ==References== ==External links== * The Five Sikh Symbols ‚Äì SikhismGuide.org * The Five Kakkars ‚Äì Sikh Bani * The Sikh Symbols ‚Äì eBook * The Sikh Bangle (Kara) ‚Äì eBook * http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17448727.2014.882181 Category:Sikh practices Category:Sikh religious clothing ","title":"The Five Ks"},{"id":"525359","text":"The Labrador Party (or New Labrador Party) was the name of two political parties in Newfoundland advocating the interests of the region of Labrador, Canada. ==New Labrador Party (1969-1975)== The party was founded in 1969, by Tom Burgess, a disaffected former Liberal MHA who crossed the floor to become an independent when he was passed over for a cabinet seat. He was re-elected to the Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly from Labrador West in the 1971 provincial election under the New Labrador Party banner. The election returned a hung parliament. Burgess initially indicated that he would support the opposition Progressive Conservative Party's bid to form a government and unseat Premier Joey Smallwood's Liberals but, days after Conservative leader Frank Moores was sworn in as Premier, Burgess was enticed to rejoin the Liberals under the false promise that he would succeed Joey Smallwood as Liberal leader and Premier. Burgess joined the Liberals on January 31, 1972http://www.heritage.nf.ca/law/changing_gov_timeline.html but was defeated in the party's leadership convention. His defection and that of a Progressive Conservative MHA was enough to bring down the Moores government and force an election; however, Burgess lost his seat and Moores formed a majority Conservative government. Mike Martin won a seat for the party in a 1972 by- election in Labrador South, but the MHA retired prior to the 1975 election, and the party was dissolved. ==Second Labrador Party== Feelings among Labradorians that the region has been neglected by the Newfoundland and Labrador government led to the party's refounding in 2003 with Ern Condon as leader. The party nominated candidates in each of Labrador's four ridings in that year's election, with the hope of holding the balance of power in the House of Assembly and being able to trade political support for more services and attention to Labrador. The party failed to win any seats, though Brandon Pardy came in second in Lake Melville with 32% of the vote. The party received 12% of the vote in Labrador West, 8% in Cartwright-L'Anse au Clair, and 5% in Torngat Mountains. The party chose Ron Barron, the Deputy Mayor of Wabush, as the party leader in preparation for the next provincial election. In a by- election for the riding of Labrador West held on March 13, 2007, Labrador Party candidate Ron Barron came in third, winning 670 of a total of just over 4000 votes cast. In the fall election in 2007, the Labrador Party decided not to run candidates in each of Labrador's four ridings so the vote between parties opposed to the Progressive Conservatives would not get split. Jimmy Tuttauk earned almost 8 percent of the vote in the district of Torngat Mountains.CBC's Newfoundland & Labrador Votes 2007, Torngat Mountains ==Leaders== * Tom Burgess (1969-1972) * Ern Condon (2003-2004) * Ron Barron (2004-2007) ==See also== *List of political parties in Newfoundland and Labrador *2007 Labrador West provincial by-election ==Notes== ==External links== *History of the New Labrador Party (1969-1975) Category:Provincial political parties in Newfoundland and Labrador ","title":"Labrador Party"},{"id":"525362","text":"A view of Fukuwatari in Takebe, Okayama Rural landscape of Kawaguchi in Takebe, Okayama is a hilly and mountainous area located at the north end of Kita-ku in Okayama City, Okayama Prefecture, Japan.

In mid-February, Hinase hosts its annual Oyster Festival (Kaki- Matsuri. On this day oysters can be purchased fresh and cooked in public BBQ areas for consumption. Local delicacies, such as Kaki-Oko (Oyster Okonomiyaki), a pancake-type dish with cabbage, vegetables, oysters and a piquant sauce) are proudly served up to visitors and locals alike. Also famous in the area are Kaki-Fry (fried oysters) which can be served with a sauce, or in a soft-serve ice-cream covered in soya-sauce.

Zittoun, Tania, Transitions: Symbolic Resources in Development, IAP, 2006, p168. He first became known for his \\"Andre the Giant Has a Posse\\" (...OBEY...) sticker campaign while attending the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD). He became widely known during the 2008 U.S. presidential election for his Barack Obama \\"Hope\\" poster. The Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston has described him as one of the best known and most influential street artists.Upcoming Exhibitions, SHEPARD FAIREY, The Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston His work is included in the collections at The Smithsonian, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego, the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C., the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond, and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.\\"Local woman‚Äôs grandson behind the Obama ‚ÄúHope‚Äù poster \\" , Independent, South Carolina Fairey is known for his \\"bold iconic style that is based on styling and idealizing images.\\" ==Early life== Shepard Fairey was born and raised in Charleston, South Carolina. His father, Strait Fairey, is a doctor, and his mother, Charlotte, a realtor.Dottie Ashley, [Artist still challenges the status quo], The Post and Courier, August 22, 2010. Retrieved December 23, 2010. He attended Wando High School in Mt. Pleasant, South Carolina, and transferred to high school at Idyllwild Arts Academy in Idyllwild, California, from which he graduated in 1988. Fairey became involved with art in 1984, when he started to place his drawings on skateboards and T-shirts. He moved to Rhode Island in 1988 to attend the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD). In 1992 he earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in Illustration from the RISD. ===Obey Giant sticker === Fairey created the \\"Andr√© the Giant Has a Posse\\" sticker campaign in 1989, while attending the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD).Steven Heller, V√©ronique Vienne, Citizen Designer: Perspectives on Design Responsibility, Allworth Communications Inc., 2003, p223. This later evolved into the \\"Obey Giant\\" campaign, which has grown via an international network of collaborators replicating Fairey's original designs.Ian Noble, Picture Perfect: Fusions of Illustration & Design, Rotovision, 2003, pp 128‚Äì129. Fairey intended the Obey Giant to inspire curiosity and cause people to question their relationship with their surroundings. According to the Obey Giant website, \\"The sticker has no meaning but exists only to cause people to react, to contemplate and search for meaning in the sticker\\". The website also says, by contrast, that those who are familiar with the sticker find humor and enjoyment from it and that those who try to analyze its meaning only burden themselves and may condemn the art as an act of vandalism from an evil, underground cult. \\"Andre the Giant Has A Posse\\" and \\"Lovelife\\" stickers, Berlin, Germany Originally intending the sticker campaign to gain fame among his classmates and college peers, Fairey says: > At first I was only thinking about the response from my clique of art school > and skateboard friends. The fact that a larger segment of the public would > not only notice, but investigate, the unexplained appearance of the stickers > was something I had not contemplated. When I started to see reactions and > consider the sociological forces at work surrounding the use of public space > and the insertion of a very eye-catching but ambiguous image, I began to > think there was the potential to create a phenomenon. In a manifesto he wrote in 1990, and since posted on his website, he links his work with Heidegger's concept of phenomenology.Steven Heller, V√©ronique Vienne, Citizen Designer: Perspectives on Design Responsibility, Allworth Communications Inc., 2003, p224. His \\"Obey\\" Campaign is from the John Carpenter movie They Live which starred pro wrestler Roddy Piper, taking a number of its slogans, including the \\"Obey\\" slogan, as well as the \\"This is Your God\\" slogan. Fairey has spun off the OBEY clothing line from the original sticker campaign. He also uses the slogan \\"The Medium is the Message\\" borrowed from Marshall McLuhan. Shepard Fairey has stated in an interview that part of his work is inspired by other street artists. ===Post-graduation=== After graduation, he founded a small printing business in Providence, Rhode Island, called Alternate Graphics, specializing in T-shirt and sticker silkscreens, which afforded Fairey the ability to continue pursuing his own artwork. While residing in Providence in 1994, Fairey met American filmmaker Helen Stickler, who had also attended RISD and graduated with a film degree. The following spring, Stickler completed a short documentary film about Shepard and his work, titled \\"Andre the Giant has a Posse\\". The film premiered in the 1995 New York Underground Film Festival, and went on to play at the 1997 Sundance Film Festival. It has been seen in more than 70 festivals and museums internationally. Mozilla's former logo, as designed by Shepard Fairey in 1998 Fairey was a founding partner, along with Dave Kinsey and Phillip DeWolff, of the design studio BLK/MRKT Inc. from 1997 to 2003, which specialised in guerrilla marketing, and \\"the development of high-impact marketing campaigns\\".Steven Heller, V√©ronique Vienne, Citizen Designer: Perspectives on Design Responsibility, Allworth Communications Inc., 2003, p225. Clients included Pepsi, Hasbro and Netscape (for whom Fairey designed the red dinosaur version of mozilla.org's logo and mascot). In 2003 he founded the Studio Number One design agency with his wife Amanda Fairey. The agency produced the cover work for The Black Eyed Peas' album Monkey Business and the poster for the film Walk the Line. Fairey has also designed the covers for The Smashing Pumpkins' album Zeitgeist, Flogging Molly's CD/DVD Whiskey on a Sunday, Led Zeppelin's compilation Mothership and movie Celebration Day, and Anthrax's The Greater Of Two Evils. Along with Banksy, Dmote, and others Fairey created work at a warehouse exhibition in Alexandria, Sydney, for Semi-Permanent in 2003. Approximately 1,500 people attended. In 2004, Fairey joined artists Robbie Conal and Mear One to create a series of \\"anti-war, anti-Bush\\" posters for a street art campaign called \\"Be the Revolution\\" for the art collective \\"Post Gen\\". \\"Be the Revolution\\" kicked off with a night of performances featuring Z-Trip, Ozomatli and David J at the Avalon in Hollywood. Fairey also co- founded Swindle Magazine along with Roger Gastman. Fairey, in 2005, \\"wallpapering Hawaiian-themed variations of his art on the rink's vertical surfaces\\", at the Makiki, Honolulu, Skate Park In 2005 he collaborated for a second time with Z-Trip on a limited edition 12-inch featuring Chuck D entitled \\"Shock and Awe\\". In 2005 Fairey also collaborated with DJ Shadow on a box set, with T-shirts, stickers, prints, and a mix CD by Shadow. In 2005 he showed abroad, for instance in Paris at the Magda Danysz Gallery, and was a resident artist at the Honolulu Museum of Art Spalding House (formerly known as The Contemporary Museum, Honolulu).

While at Project 2050 Shepard developed creative work for Virgin Mega Store and Boost Mobile. The book Supply and Demand: The Art of Shepard Fairey was released in 2006. In 2008, Philosophy of Obey (Obey Giant): The Formative Years (1989‚Äì2008), edited by Sarah Jaye Williams, was published by Nerve Books UK, and praised by Fairey.\\"The philosophy of Obey\\", obeygiant.com. Retrieved July 16, 2008. In June 2007, Fairey opened his one-man show entitled \\"E Pluribus Venom\\", at the Jonathan LeVine Gallery. The show made the arts section front page in the New York Times. Fairey donated original cover art to the 2008 album Body of War: Songs That Inspired an Iraq War Veteran, produced for Iraq War documentary Body of War. Proceeds from the album benefit non-profit organization Iraq Veterans Against the War. In 2008 Fairey teamed up again with Z-Trip to do a series of shows in support of then presidential candidate Barack Obama entitled Party For Change. Fairey also designed posters for the British goth band Bauhaus. OBEY Giant clothing, 2008 Nordstrom department store In September 2008, Shepard opened his solo show titled \\"Duality of Humanity\\" at White Walls & Shooting Gallery in San Francisco. His third solo show with the gallery featured one hundred and fifty works, including the largest collection of canvases pieces in one show that he's done. Fairey was arrested on February 7, 2009, on his way to the premiere of his show at the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston, Massachusetts, on two outstanding warrants related to graffiti. He was charged with damage to property for having postered two Boston area locations with graffiti, a Boston Police Department spokesman said. His arrest was announced to party goers by longtime friend Z-Trip who had been performing at the ICA premiere at Shepard Fairey's request. On April 27, 2009, Fairey put three signed copies of his Obama inauguration posters up on eBay, with the proceeds of the auction going to the One Love For Chi foundation, founded by the family of Deftones bassist Chi Cheng following a car accident in November 2008 that nearly claimed Cheng's life. Fairey's first art museum exhibition, titled Supply & Demand (as was his earlier book), was held in Boston at the Institute of Contemporary Art during the summer of 2009. The exhibition featured more than 250 works in a wide variety of media: screen prints, stencils, stickers, rubylith illustrations, collages, and works on wood, metal and canvas. As a complement to the ICA exhibition, Fairey created public art works around Boston. The artist explains his driving motivation: \\"The real message behind most of my work is 'question everything'.\\" In 2011 Time Magazine commissioned Fairey to design its cover to honor \\"The Protester\\" as Person of the Year in the wake of the Arab Spring, Occupy Wall Street and other social movements around the world. This was Fairey's second Person of the Year cover for Time, his first being of Barack Obama in 2008. In January 2015, Shepard Fairey made a cameo appearance on Portlandia. In July 2015, Fairey was arrested and detained at Los Angeles International Airport, after passing through customs, on a warrant for allegedly vandalizing 14 buildings in Detroit. He subsequently turned himself in to Detroit Police. On September 17, 2015, the Jacob Lewis Gallery presented Shepard Fairey's exhibition \\"On Our Hands\\", his first solo opening in New York City in five years. The paintings reflect on contemporary issues facing our global community: political corruption, environmental apathy and abuse of power. The exhibition coincides with Fairey's new monograph Covert to Overt, published by Rizzoli. Life Is Beautiful Fremont East District, Las Vegas Mural Project 2016. ==The Hope poster== Fairey created a series of posters supporting Barack Obama's 2008 candidacy for President of the United States, including the iconic \\"HOPE\\" portrait. The New Yorker art critic Peter Schjeldahl called the poster \\"the most efficacious American political illustration since 'Uncle Sam Wants You'\\". Fairey also created an exclusive design for Rock the Vote. Because the Hope poster had been \\"perpetuated illegally\\" and independently by the street artist, the Obama campaign declined to have any direct affiliation with it. Although the campaign officially disavowed any involvement in the creation or popularization of the poster, Fairey has commented in interviews that he was in communication with campaign officials during the period immediately following the poster's release. Fairey has stated that the original version featured the word \\"PROGRESS\\" instead of the word \\"HOPE\\", and that within weeks of its release, the campaign requested that he issue (and legally disseminate) a new version, keeping the powerful image of Obama's face but captioning it with the word \\"HOPE\\". The campaign openly embraced the revised poster along with two additional Fairey posters that featured the words \\"CHANGE\\" and \\"VOTE\\". Fairey distributed 300,000 stickers and 500,000 posters during the campaign, funding his grassroots electioneering through poster and fine art sales. \\"I just put all that money back into making more stuff, so I didn't keep any of the Obama money\\", explained Fairey in December 2009. In February 2008, Fairey received a letter of thanks from Obama for his contribution to the campaign. The letter stated: On November 5, 2008, Chicago posted banners throughout the downtown business district featuring Fairey's Obama \\"HOPE\\" portrait.City Hall reacts to Obama win, ABC WLS-TV, November 5, 2008 Fairey created a similar but new image of Barack Obama for Time magazine, which was used as the cover art for the 2008 Person of the Year issue. The original iconic \\"HOPE\\" portrait was featured on the cover of Esquire Magazine's February 2009 issue, this time with a caption reading, \\"WHAT NOW?\\" Shepard Fairey's influence throughout the presidential election was a factor in the artist himself having been named a Person of the Year for 2008 by GQ. In January 2009, the \\"HOPE\\" portrait was acquired by the U.S. National Portrait Gallery and made part of its permanent collection. It was unveiled and put on display on January 17, 2009. In 2009 Fairey's Obama portrait was featured in the book Art For Obama: Designing Manifest Hope and the Campaign for Change, which Fairey also edited. Mandela by Shepard Fairey Mural In his December 8, 2010 appearance on The Colbert Report, Stephen Colbert asked Fairey how he felt about having done the \\"HOPE\\" portrait of Obama and how \\"that hope was working out for him now?\\" to which Fairey replied: \\"You know, I'm proud of it as a piece of grassroots activism, but I'll just leave it at that\\". In an interview with Esquire in 2015 Fairey said that Obama had not lived up to his expectations, \\"not even close\\". He continued, \\"Obama has had a really tough time, but there have been a lot of things that he's compromised on that I never would have expected. I mean, drones and domestic spying are the last things I would have thought [he'd support].\\" Fairey created a mutt version of the red, white, and blue poster, donating it to help support pet adoptions, from an image of a rescued shaggy dog taken by photographer Clay Myers. Four hundred limited edition prints were offered by Adopt-A-Pet.com, a nonprofit organization that helps shelters, humane societies and rescue groups advertise their homeless pets to potential adopters.\\"Obama poster artist does one for the dogs\\", Ohmidog! magazine, February 6, 2009. The poster, which was also offered as a free download, was featured on the cover of the spring 2009 edition of Dog‚Äôs Life magazine. ===The Mandela mural=== In 2014, Fairey painted a towering mural, 9 stories high, paying tribute to Nelson Mandela and the 25th anniversary of the Purple Rain Protest. It is a public artwork on Juta Street in Braamfontein, Johannesburg, overlooking the Nelson Mandela Bridge. The mural is Fairey's first work in Africa and is seen by many as a sequel to the iconic Barack Obama HOPE poster. \\"It is a huge exclamation point downtown...\\" said Patrick Gaspard, American Ambassador to South Africa, which makes us remember the entire liberation struggle and the remarkably peaceful transition to freedom Nelson Mandela achieved. ===Honest Gil Fulbright=== 227x227pxFairey created an adaptation of the Obama HOPE poster for satirical Kentucky politician Honest Gil Fulbright.Sean Sullivan, \\"Why the artist behind Obama‚Äôs ‚ÄòHope‚Äô poster is helping a fake candidate\\", Washington Post, August 11, 2014. Frank L. Ridley, the actor who portrays Fulbright, is featured on the poster, along with the words \\"SOLD\\", which refers to Fulbright's \\"honest\\" political message: \\"I'm only in this thing for the money, but at least I'm honest about it.\\" ===Marianne=== As a tribute to the victims of the November 2015 Paris attacks, Fairey created a poster representing Marianne, the French national icon, surrounded by the national motto Libert√©, √©galit√©, fraternit√©. In June 2016, this design was painted as a mural on 186 rue Nationale, Paris. Fairey made a gift of the poster to Emmanuel Macron, who hung it in his office upon assuming the presidency of France. === We the People series === This series was made during the 2016 presidential campaign as a protest on racism. This work aims to promote gender equality and fights discrimination against minorities. This work stands out to many as it provokes people to respect their common humanity. The title of the work comes from a line in the Constitution and features portraits of Native Americans, African Americans, Muslims, and Latinas, aiming to defend their dignity. === Make Art Not War === This work is a mural for Urban Nation in Berlin, Germany. The street art was created in 2014 by Fairey. The work became a motto for street artists and demonstrated Fairey's political support for anti war movements and peace. The work was made like traditional street art with spray paint, and features many of Fairey's motifs and symbols from other works. This repetition includes the black and red cartoon like style with repetition of symbols such as roses. === Major Mural Commissions === * Peace Elephant (2011) in West Hollywood Library, Los Angeles * Purple Project (2014) multistory mural in Johannesburg * The Institute of Contemporary Art (2009), Boston, hosted Fairey‚Äôs first major solo exhibition, ‚ÄúSupply and Demand‚Äù ==Activism and humanitarianism== A 2016 poster by Fairey, shown during the 2017 Women's March, depicts a Muslim-American woman Shepard Fairey has always been open about controversial social and political topics and often donates and creates artwork in order to promote awareness of these social issues and contributes directly to these causes. In the early 2000s, Fairey began donating to organizations such as Chiapas Relief Fund, the ACLU, Feeding America, and the Art of Elysium. Following the Obama campaign, Fairey donated proceeds from these poster sales to the ACLU and Feeding America. In September 2010, Fairey created a poster for the ACLU with actress Olivia Wilde as the Statue of Liberty holding a megaphone and a clipboard, the ACLU's weapons of choice. The Obey Awareness Program, operated by Obey Clothing, was founded in 2007 as an extension of Fairey's humanitarian efforts. This program allows Fairey to support causes he believes in by selling specially designed merchandise and donating 100% of the profits raised to handpicked organizations and their causes. Past non-profit organizations benefiting from this program include Hope for Darfur, 11th Hour Action, Feed America, earthquake relief in Haiti, Dark Wave / Rising Sun for Japan relief, and Adopt-a-Pet.com. Environmentally related non-profit organizations such as the Surfrider Foundation, Urban Roots, the Alaskan Wildlife Refuge and more also received donations. The latest Obey Awareness T-shirts benefitted the Go Campaign, an organization that improves the lives of orphans and vulnerable children around the world by partnering with local heroes to deliver local solutions. Fairey sits on the advisory board of Reaching to Embrace the Arts, a nonprofit organization that provides art supplies to disadvantaged schools and students. In 2007, Fairey was commissioned to create a logo for \\"Music Is Revolution Foundation\\" and became a board member of the Music Is Revolution Foundation, a nonprofit organization that supports music education for students in public schools. As a type 1 diabetic, Fairey often contributes to non-profit organizations assisting in medical research. He is one of the earliest supporters of Give to Cure, a non-profit organization devoted to accelerating the process of finding cures for human diseases. Fairey created the first Give To Cure sticker series with 20 distinct designs. In addition, he created three special edition prints to commemorate the inaugural Give To Cure campaign. In January 2012, Fairey created an exclusive print called \\"The Cure\\" for the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF), the leading global organization funding type 1 diabetes research. All proceeds from the sale went toward the JDRF. In June 2013, a feature documentary called \\"The Human Trial\\" about the quest to cure type 1 diabetes caught the attention of Fairey who then created the movie poster in order to raise funds for the film. Every year since 2009, Fairey has contributed his art to raise funds for the RUSH Philanthropic Arts Foundation. In August 2011, Fairey donated the Buddhist inspired piece Mandala Ornament (valued at $12,000) to help raise funds for the Foundation through the ART FOR LIFE online auction, the primary annual fundraising effort that helps support thousands of underserved New York children. Proceeds from the annual gala and auction benefitted the Foundation's signature arts education and gallery programs, which directly serve 2,300 students each year. In June 2009, Fairey created a poster in support of the plight of Aung San Suu Kyi to bring awareness to the human rights cause in Burma. The proceeds from this print benefitted the Human Rights Action Center and the U.S. Campaign for Burma. In 2009, Fairey teamed up with artist and activist Ernesto Yerena, activist Marco Amador and musician Zack de la Rocha of Rage Against the Machine, to create, distribute, and sell posters countering dehumanizing and anti-immigrant rhetoric for the We Are Human Campaign. A majority of the proceeds went to the National Day Labor Organizing Network (NDLON) and Puente, a grassroots community group that fights for human dignity. Fairey has also created artwork to benefit the David Lynch Foundation for Consciousness-Based Education and World Peace (DLF). In April 2009, Fairey created a poster for the David Lynch Foundation's \\"Change Begins Within\\" benefit concert. In April 2011, Fairey donated unique collector's items to the foundation's \\"Download for Good\\" campaign. In April 2015, Fairey created a commemorative poster for the 10-year anniversary of the music of David Lynch, with all proceeds from poster sales going to the foundation. In November 2009, Fairey partnered with LGBT grassroots organization FAIR to auction \\"Defend Equality Love Unites\\" posters to raise awareness and funds for the fight for gay and lesbian marriage equality. Fairey is a supporter of artist movements such as The Art of Elysium, an organization aiming to affect social change by making art available to striving artists and young people battling serious illnesses. In August 2010, Fairey donated one original Burmese Monk fine art piece as well as an opportunity for a live portrait sitting for Art of Elysium. In September 2014, Fairey curated The Art of Elysium's GENESIS showcase of emerging L.A. artists, creatives, tastemakers, and social leaders. In May 2010, Fairey partnered with Feeding America and The Advertising Council to create an outdoor public service advertisement to raise awareness about domestic hunger. In 2011, Fairey was named honorary chair of the Young Literati, a philanthropic group of the Library Foundation of Los Angeles. Fairey has created artwork and curated several Young Literati Annual Toast events benefitting the Library Foundation. Fairey's wife Amanda has held the position of chair of the Library Foundation since 2013. In December 2011, Fairey contributed to the Robert Rauschenberg Foundation's inaugural \\"Artist as Activist\\" print project to benefit the Coalition for the Homeless. Fairey created an original print called \\"The Future is Unwritten\\" to commemorate Rauschenburg's dedication to important social issues and the mission of the Coalition for the Homeless. The print was sold on Artnet to raise over $150,000 to support the Coalition's life-saving programs. In July 2013, Fairey did a public arts project for the nonprofit L.A. Fund for Education. Fairey's design titled \\"Create Your Future\\" was one of three installments in the #ArtsMatter campaign, which was a collaborative effort with P.S. ARTS and featured the art displayed on billboards and buses across the city of Los Angeles to send the message that arts matter in schools. Again in 2015, Fairey contributed to P.S. Arts, and collaborated with Marc Phillips Decorative Rugs to create a one-of-kind rug for a benefit auction for P.S. Arts. In March 2014, Fairey created a portrait of Ai Weiwei with Friends of Ai Weiwei, a group of Ai supporters who were trying to promote awareness of the artists‚Äô legal status in China where authorities had confiscated his passport. Proceeds from the posters went toward Friends of Ai Weiwei's efforts to help the artist and to promote free speech. The following year Ai Weiwei was granted a visa, reversing a decision not to grant him the travel document. Shepard Fairey has also created works to support school safety, and posters with his art were seen at the March for Our Lives rally in Washington, D.C. on March 24, 2018.Hayley Garrison Phillips. \\"The Artist Behind Obama's \\"Hope\\" Portrait Just Released A Series of Free Posters in Support of Gun Reform\\".

Street art is characterized by a nonpermissive art method of production, which reveals the rebellious nature and activism that challenges the viewer‚Äôs perspective regarding the surrounding environment. Street art has features that distinguish it from other art forms such as graffiti and public art. The defiant nature of the art form itself reveals the defiant structure of Fairey's art and the political challenge it has on others. ==Legal issues with appropriation and fair use== Fairey has been criticized for failing to obtain permission and to provide attribution for works he used.The artist Mark Vallen posted an essay criticizing this practice, along with multiple examples.How phony is Shepard Fairey?, Dan Wasserman, The Boston Globe, February 2, 2009. Fairey has threatened to sue artists for the same technique.

On April 23, 2008, Orr received a cease- and-desist order from Fairey's attorneys, telling him to stop selling Protect because it violated Fairey's trademark. Fairey threatened to sue, calling the designer a \\"parasite\\".Artist Cage Match: Fairey vs. Orr, Richard Whittaker, The Austin Chronicle, May 13, 2008. Originally, Fairey had claimed his HOPE poster was based on a 2006 copyrighted photo of then-Senator Barack Obama seated next to actor George Clooney, taken in April 2006 by Mannie Garcia on assignment for the Associated Press, which wanted credit and compensation for the work.Artist, AP Disagree Over Photo Credit, Payment, Morning Edition, National Public Radio, February 5, 2009 Garcia believes that he personally owns the copyright for the photo, and has said, \\"If you put all the legal stuff away, I‚Äôm so proud of the photograph and that Fairey did what he did artistically with it, and the effect it's had\\". Fairey said his use of the photograph fell within the legal definition of fair use. Fairey claims he used pieces of the photo as raw material to create a heroic and inspirational political portrait, the aesthetic of which was fundamentally different from the original photo. Lawyers for both sides tried to reach an amicable agreement. In February 2009, Fairey filed a federal lawsuit against the Associated Press, seeking a declaratory judgment that his use of the AP photograph was protected by the fair use doctrine and so did not infringe their copyright. The case is Shepard Fairey; Obey Giant Art Inc. v. The Associated Press, No. 09-CV-1123, S.D.N.Y.. At first, Fairey claimed that he used the photo of Clooney and Obama, cropped the actor out of the shot, and made other changes. In October 2009, Shepard Fairey admitted he had tried to deceive the Court by destroying evidence that he had instead used the photograph alleged by the AP. Fairey admitted he had used a close-up shot of Obama, also taken by Mannie Garcia, as the AP had long alleged. The solo photo appears much more similar to the final HOPE poster than the photo of Clooney and Obama. Fairey's lawyers announced they were no longer representing him, and Laurence Pulgram, an intellectual property lawyer, stated that the revelation definitely put Mr. Fairey's case \\"in trouble\\". In May 2010, a judge urged Fairey to settle. The parties settled in January 2011. On February 24, 2012, Fairey pleaded guilty to criminal contempt of court for \\"destroying documents and manufacturing evidence.\\" On September 7, 2012, Fairey was sentenced to 300 hours of community service, ordered to pay a $25,000 federal fine, and placed on probation for two years by U.S. Magistrate Judge Frank Maas. Shepard Fairey was also charged with destruction of property in 2015 for tagging 18 posters at unsanctioned sites. This demonstrated his growth and interest in political activism and awareness through his art impact. ==Critical response== Shepard Fairey at a book signing for Supply & Demand: The Art of Shepard Fairey Fairey's mural at Jagtvej 69, Copenhagen, in October 2019 Liam O'Donoghue interviewed Fairey for Mother Jones and questioned the artist about criticism related to his use of images from social movements, specifically images created by black artists. O'Donoghue later posted an article, titled \\"Shepard Fairey‚Äôs Image Problem\\", on several independent media sites. O' Donoghue explored Fairey's use of copyright-protected images while defending his own copyright-protected works from being used by other artists and corporations. Fairey cited his collaboration with Public Enemy, his funding of the Zapatista Army of National Liberation, and his six-figure charitable contributions for Darfur assistance as responses to charges of exploitation. > \\"I challenge anybody to fuck with that, know what I mean\\", Fairey stated. > \\"It's not like I'm just jumping on some cool rebel cause for the sake of > exploiting it for profit. People like to talk shit, but it's usually to > justify their own apathy. I don't want to demean anyone's struggles through > casual appropriation of something powerful; that's not my intention.\\" Erick Lyle has accused Fairey of cynically turning graffiti culture into a self-promoting advertising campaign.Erick Lyle in Josh MacPhee, Erik Reuland, Realizing the Impossible: Art Against Authority, AK Press, 2007, p. 87. . On the other hand, San Diego Union-Tribune art critic Robert L. Pincus says Fairey's work \\"is political art with a strong sense of visual style and emotional authenticity. Even in times when political art has ebbed, Fairey's has just the right balance of seriousness, irony and wit to fit the mood of the moment\\". The Walrus contributor Nick Mount wrote \\"Following the example set by gallery art, some street art is more about the concept than the art. 'Fuck Bush' isn‚Äôt an aesthetic; it‚Äôs an ethic. Shepard Fairey‚Äôs Obey Giant stickers and Akay‚Äôs Akayism posters are clever children of Duchamp, ironic conceptual art.\\" But Stephen Heller of The New York Times suggested that Fairey's political art has similarities to political art from the past, for instance to political art created by Andy Warhol. In a New York Times review of \\"E Pluribus Venom\\" at Jonathan LeVine Gallery, art critic Benjamin Genocchio described Fairey's art as \\"generic\\" despite the range of mediums and styles used by the artist. Genocchio went on to say that it was tempting to see Fairey's art as just another luxury commodity. Andrew Michael Ford, the director of Ad Hoc Art, said that Fairey's practice does not \\"match up\\" in the minds of people who view his work. Ford suggests that some people will view Fairey's work as \\"very commercial\\". In his comments, he suggested that Fairey is \\"ripe\\" for criticism because he profits from politically and socially charged works. Ford stated that, despite his criticism, he is a fan of Fairey work. Artists Mark Vallen, Lincoln Cushing, Josh MacPhee, and Favianna Rodriguez have documented that Fairey has appropriated work by Koloman Moser, Ralph Chaplin, Pirkle Jones, Rupert Garcia, Rene Mederos, F√©lix Beltr√°n, and Gary Grimshaw, among others. In his critique, \\"Obey Plagiarist Shepard Fairey\\", Vallen dissects various works by Fairey, demonstrating them to be plagiarized from the work of other artists. Jamie O'Shea criticizes Vallen's approach for a \\"nearly ubiquitous lack of understanding of the artist‚Äôs use of appropriated imagery in his work and the longstanding historical precedent for this mode of creative expression,\\" in addition to being masked in a thin \\"veneer of obvious envy in most cases\\". Art critic Brian Sherwin lashed out at O‚ÄôShea's criticism of Mark Vallen by saying that O‚ÄôShea's SUPERTOUCH article was nothing more than \\"damage control\\". Sherwin questioned O‚ÄôShea's defense of Fairey, noting that Fairey is a SUPERTOUCH author and business associate of O‚ÄôShea. Sherwin suggests that O‚ÄôShea has a \\"vested\\" interest in making sure that Fairey is viewed positively by the public since he has curated art exhibits involving Fairey and has written extensively about the artist. Sherwin wrote that O‚ÄôShea once served as editor in chief for Juxtapoz and has worked as a creative director hired by corporate art collections as a corporate liaison for acquisitions. Sherwin concluded that the public will \\"question the artist who says to question everything,\\" regardless of O‚ÄôShea's Mark Vallen \\"damage control\\" on SUPERTOUCH. Sherwin implied that O'Shea's critique of Vallen was selective because key negative facts about Fairey's history were left out in the article. The dispute between Sherwin and O‚ÄôShea was cited by Dan Wasserman on The Boston Globe‚Äôs \\"Out of Line\\". Bloggers have criticized Fairey for accepting commissions from corporations such as Saks Fifth Avenue, for which his design agency produced illustrations inspired by Constructivism and Alexander Rodchenko. Fairey defends his corporate commissions by saying that clients such as Saks Fifth Avenue help him to keep his studio operational and his assistants employed. Fairey has acknowledged the irony of being a street artist exploring themes of free speech while at the same time being an artist hired by corporations for consumer campaigns. He says simply that designers and artists have to make money to survive. > \\"I consider myself a populist artist,\\" Fairey says. \\"I want to reach people > through as many different platforms as possible. Street art is a > bureaucracy-free way of reaching people, but T-shirts, stickers, commercial > jobs, the Internet ‚Äì there are so many different ways that I use to put my > work in front of people.\\" In August 2011, Fairey received a black eye and a bruised rib after being attacked outside of the Kodboderne 18 nightclub in Copenhagen, Denmark. Fairey claims the two assailants called him \\"Obama illuminati\\" and ordered him to \\"go back to America\\". He believes the attack was the result of a misunderstanding over his artwork, which commemorated the demolition of the legendary Ungdomshuset (youth house) at Jagtvej 69. His mural showed a peace dove in flight surrounded by a circle of T√∏nder lace above the word \\"Peace\\"; it was vandalized within 24 hours of its unveiling with graffiti slogans \\"no peace\\" and \\"go home, Yankee hipster\\". The media reported that the artwork was commissioned by the Copenhagen Municipality, but the original mural was organized by Fairey's Copenhagen gallery, V1. It was not a government- sponsored work. == Exhibitions  Selected solo exhibitions === * 2000: Obey Giant, Anno Domini Gallery, San Jose, CA * 2002: Overnight Delivery, BLK/MRKT Gallery, Culver City, CA * 2002: Shepard Fairey, Kinsey/DesForges Gallery, Culver City, CA * 2004: Obey, V1 Gallery, Copenhagen * 2004: Supply and Demand, Merry Karnowsky Gallery - LA, Los Angeles, CA * 2005: Manufacturing Dissent, Merry Karnowsky Gallery - LA, Los Angeles, CA * 2005: Shepard Fairey, Honolulu Museum of Art, Honolulu, HI * 2006: Obey, Magda Danysz Gallery, Paris, France * 2006: Rise Above, Merry Karnowsky Gallery - LA, Los Angeles, CA * 2007: E Pluribus Venom, Jonathan LeVine Gallery, New York, NY * 2007: Ninteeneightyfouria, Stolenspace Gallery, London * 2007: Imperfect Union, Merry Karnowsky Gallery - LA, Los Angeles, CA * 2009: Supply & Demand, ICA - Institute of Contemporary Art Boston, Boston, MA * 2009: Shepard Fairey, National Portrait Gallery, Canberra, ACT * 2009: Supply & Demand, The Andy Warhol Museum, Pittsburgh, PA * 2010: Supply and Demand, CAC - Cincinnati Contemporary Arts Center, Cincinnati, OH * 2010: May Day, Deitch Projects - 76 Grand Street, New York, NY * 2011: Revolutions - The Album Cover Art Of Shepard Fairey, Robert Berman Gallery, Santa Monica, CA * 2012: Sound & Vision, Stolenspace Gallery, London * 2015: On Our Hands, Jacob Lewis Gallery, New York, NY * 2015: Sid Superman is Dead : Shepard Fairey et Denis Morris, Magda Danysz Gallery, Paris, France * 2015: Your Eyes Here, CAC Centro de Arte Contempor√°neo de M√°laga, M√°laga * 2016: Victory is Peace - Shepard Fairey x NoN√ÖME, Positive-Propaganda Artspace, Munich, Germany * 2017: Shepard Fairey: Work Against The Clampdown, Art Museum of West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV *2018: Shepard Fairey: Salad Days, 1989-1999, Cranbrook Art Museum, Bloomfield, Hills, MI * 2019: Retrospective Shepard Fairey, (600 works for Grenoble Street Art Fest), Grenoble, France === Selected group exhibitions === * 1999: Sticker Shock: Artists, ICA - Institute of Contemporary Art - University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA * 2003: Beautiful Losers, CAC - Cincinnati Contemporary Arts Center, Cincinnati, OH * 2004: Backjumps - The Live Issue #1, Kunstraum Kreuzberg / Bethanien, Berlin * 2008: Under a Red Sky, Stolenspace Gallery, London * 2009: The Art of Rebellion, Robert Berman Gallery, Santa Monica, CA * 2009: Urban Art - Werke aus der Sammlung Reinking, Weserburg  Museum f√ºr moderne Kunst, Bremen * 2009: Viva la Revolucion: A Dialogue with the Urban Landscape, Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego - MCASD Downtown, San Diego, CA * 2013: At home I¬¥m a tourist‚Äô Colecci√≥n de Selim Varol, CAC Centro de Arte Contempor√°neo de M√°laga, M√°laga * 2014: The Insistent Image: Recurrent Motifs in the Art of Shepard Fairey and Jasper John, Halsey Institute of Contemporary Art, Charleston, SC * 2014: Art Alliance: The Provocateurs, Block 37, Chicago, IL Christopher Borrelli, \\"Lollapalooza gets a giant art show\\", Chicago Tribune, April 30, 2014 * 2015: Sleeping Beauty, Magda Danysz Gallery, Paris, France ==Commercial artwork== Celebration Day served as a backdrop for a 2012 Led Zeppelin press conference *Fairey designed the album artwork for Flogging Molly's Whiskey on a Sunday. *Appears in the 2006 videogame, Marc Ecko's Getting Up: Contents Under Pressure, as himself. *Fairey provided the design for the Obey Giant room at The Creek South Beach. *Fairey designed the cover for the books Woodstock Experience by Michael Lang, Dan Garson, Henry Diltz (Genesis Publications, 2009)), A Heartbeat and A Guitar: Johnny Cash and the Making of Bitter Tears.

A key is a device that is used to operate a lock (such as to lock or unlock it). A typical key is a small piece of metal consisting of two parts: the bit or blade, which slides into the keyway of the lock and distinguishes between different keys, and the bow, which is left protruding so that torque can be applied by the user. In its simplest implementation, a key operates one lock or set of locks that are keyed alike, a lock/key system where each similarly keyed lock requires the same, unique key. The key serves as a security token for access to the locked area; only persons having the correct key can open the lock and gain access. In more complex mechanical lock/key systems, two different keys, one of which is known as the master key, serve to open the lock. Common metals include brass, plated brass, nickel silver, and steel. == History  Antiquity === Medieval Gothic lock, from the 15th‚Äì16th centuries, made of iron, in the Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York City) The earliest known lock and key device was discovered in the ruins of Nineveh, the capital of ancient Assyria. Locks such as this were later developed into the Egyptian wooden pin lock, which consisted of a bolt, door fixture or attachment, and key. When the key was inserted, pins within the fixture were lifted out of drilled holes within the bolt, allowing it to move. When the key was removed, the pins fell part-way into the bolt, preventing movement. The warded lock was also present from antiquity and remains the most recognizable lock and key design in the Western world. The first all-metal locks appeared between the years 870 and 900, and are attributed to the English craftsmen. It is also said that the key was invented by Theodorus of Samos in the 6th century BC. 'The Romans invented metal locks and keys and the system of security provided by wards.' Affluent Romans often kept their valuables in secure locked boxes within their households, and wore the keys as rings on their fingers. The practice had two benefits: It kept the key handy at all times, while signaling that the wearer was wealthy and important enough to have money and jewellery worth securing. Drunk man's lock at the bottom (black lock) and a regular modern lock at the top A special type of lock, dating back to the 17th-18th century, although potentially older as similar locks date back to the 14th century, can e.g. be found in the Beguinage of the Belgian city Lier.R. De Bruyn, ‚ÄòOude sloten op deurtjes in het Liers begijnhof‚Äô, in: 't land van Ryen jaargang 17, aflevering 3-4, 1967, p.158,, article in DutchEchtpaar schrijft eerste boek sinds twintig jaar over Liers begijnhof nieuwsblad.be, Chris van Rompaey, 17 april 2018, article in Dutch These locks are most likely Gothic locks, that were decorated with foliage, often in a V-shape surrounding the keyhole.Dictionary, Lexicon of locks and keys historicallocks.com They are often called drunk man's lock, however the reference to being drunk may be erroneous as these locks were, according to certain sources, designed in such a way a person can still find the keyhole in the dark, although this might not be the case as the ornaments might have been purely aesthetic. In more recent times similar locks have been designed.United States patent keyhole guide for locks and method of using the same patentimages, Eugene Toussant, 1990V-Lock Helps Drunks Get Home to Bed wired.com, Charlie Sorrel, 5 april 2010 ===Modern locks=== Chinese lock and key from alt= Key anatomy With the onset of the Industrial Revolution in the late 18th century and the concomitant development of precision engineering and component standardization, locks and keys were manufactured with increasing complexity and sophistication. The lever tumbler lock, which uses a set of levers to prevent the bolt from moving in the lock, was invented by Robert Barron in 1778. His double acting lever lock required the lever to be lifted to a certain height by having a slot cut in the lever, so lifting the lever too far was as bad as not lifting the lever far enough. This type of lock is still used today. Diagram of a Chubb detector lock The lever tumbler lock was greatly improved by Jeremiah Chubb in 1818. A burglary in Portsmouth Dockyard prompted the British Government to announce a competition to produce a lock that could be opened only with its own key. Chubb developed the Chubb detector lock, which incorporated an integral security feature that could frustrate unauthorized access attempts and would indicate to the lock's owner if it had been interfered with. Chubb was awarded ¬£100 after a trained lock-picker failed to break the lock after 3 months. In 1820, Jeremiah joined his brother Charles in starting their own lock company, Chubb. Chubb made various improvements to his lock: his 1824 improved design didn't require a special regulator key to reset the lock; by 1847 his keys used six levers rather than four; and he later introduced a disc that allowed the key to pass but narrowed the field of view, hiding the levers from anybody attempting to pick the lock. The Chubb brothers also received a patent for the first burglar-resisting safe and began production in 1835. The designs of Barron and Chubb were based on the use of movable levers, but Joseph Bramah, a prolific inventor, developed an alternative method in 1784. His lock used a cylindrical key with precise notches along the surface; these moved the metal slides that impeded the turning of the bolt into an exact alignment, allowing the lock to open. The lock was at the limits of the precision manufacturing capabilities of the time and was said by its inventor to be unpickable. In the same year Bramah started the Bramah Locks company at 124 Piccadilly, and displayed the \\"Challenge Lock\\" in the window of his shop from 1790, challenging \\"...the artist who can make an instrument that will pick or open this lock\\" for the reward of ¬£200. The challenge stood for over 67 years until, at the Great Exhibition of 1851, the American locksmith Alfred Charles Hobbs was able to open the lock and, following some argument about the circumstances under which he had opened it, was awarded the prize. Hobbs' attempt required some 51 hours, spread over 16 days. The earliest patent for a double-acting pin tumbler lock was granted to American physician Abraham O. Stansbury in England in 1805, but the modern version, still in use today, was invented by American Linus Yale Sr. in 1848. This lock design used pins of varying lengths to prevent the lock from opening without the correct key. In 1861, Linus Yale Jr. was inspired by the original 1840s pin-tumbler lock designed by his father, thus inventing and patenting a smaller flat key with serrated edges as well as pins of varying lengths within the lock itself, the same design of the pin-tumbler lock which still remains in use today. The modern Yale lock is essentially a more developed version of the Egyptian lock. Despite some improvement in key design since, the majority of locks today are still variants of the designs invented by Bramah, Chubb and Yale. == Types of lock == * Bicycle lock * Cam lock * Chamber lock * Child safety lock * Chubb detector lock * Combination lock * Cylinder lock * Dead bolt * Electric strike * Electronic lock * Lever tumbler lock * Lock screen * Luggage lock * Magnetic keyed lock * Magnetic lock * Mortise lock * Padlock * Pin tumbler lock * Police lock * Protector lock * Rim lock * Time lock ===With physical keys=== Pin tumbler no key.svgPin tumbler lock: without a key in the lock, the driver pins (blue) are pushed downwards, preventing the plug (yellow) from rotating. An additional pin called the master pin is present between the key and driver pins in locks that accept master keys to allow the plug to rotate at multiple pin elevations. Disc tumbler locked.pngWafer tumbler lock: without a key in the lock, the wafers (red) are pushed down by springs. The wafers nestle into a groove in the lower part of the outer cylinder (green) preventing the plug (yellow) from rotating. Tubular locked.pngTubular lock: the key pins (red) and driver pins (blue) are pushed towards the front of the lock, preventing the plug (yellow) from rotating. The tubular key has several half-cylinder indentations which align with the pins. A warded lock uses a set of obstructions, or wards, to prevent the lock from opening unless the correct key is inserted. The key has notches or slots that correspond to the obstructions in the lock, allowing it to rotate freely inside the lock. Warded locks are typically reserved for low-security applications as a well-designed skeleton key can successfully open a wide variety of warded locks. The pin tumbler lock uses a set of pins to prevent the lock from opening unless the correct key is inserted. The key has a series of grooves on either side of the key's blade that limit the type of lock the key can slide into. As the key slides into the lock, the horizontal grooves on the blade align with the wards in the keyway allowing or denying entry to the cylinder. A series of pointed teeth and notches on the blade, called bittings, then allow pins to move up and down until they are in line with the shear line of the inner and outer cylinder, allowing the cylinder or cam to rotate freely and the lock to open. A wafer tumbler lock is similar to the pin tumbler lock and works on a similar principle. However, unlike the pin lock (where each pin consists of two or more pieces) each wafer is a single piece. The wafer tumbler lock is often incorrectly referred to as a disc tumbler lock, which uses an entirely different mechanism. The wafer lock is relatively inexpensive to produce and is often used in automobiles and cabinetry. The disc tumbler lock or Abloy lock is composed of slotted rotating detainer discs. The lever tumbler lock uses a set of levers to prevent the bolt from moving in the lock. In its simplest form, lifting the tumbler above a certain height will allow the bolt to slide past. Lever locks are commonly recessed inside wooden doors or on some older forms of padlocks, including fire brigade padlocks. A magnetic keyed lock is a locking mechanism whereby the key utilizes magnets as part of the locking and unlocking mechanism. A magnetic key would use from one to many small magnets oriented so that the North and South poles would equate to a combination to push or pull the lock's internal tumblers thus releasing the lock. ===With electronic keys=== An electronic lock works by means of an electric current and is usually connected to an access control system. In addition to the pin and tumbler used in standard locks, electronic locks connects the bolt or cylinder to a motor within the door using a part called an actuator. Types of electronic locks include the following: A keycard lock operates with a flat card of similar dimensions as a credit card. In order to open the door, one needs to successfully match the signature within the keycard. The lock in a typical remote keyless system operates with a smart key radio transmitter. The lock typically accepts a particular valid code only once, and the smart key transmits a different rolling code every time the button is pressed. Generally the car door can be opened with either a valid code by radio transmission, or with a (non-electronic) pin tumbler key. The ignition switch may require a transponder car key to both open a pin tumbler lock and also transmit a valid code by radio transmission. A smart lock is an electromechanics lock that gets instructions to lock and unlock the door from an authorized device using a cryptographic key and wireless protocol. Smart locks have begun to be used more commonly in residential areas, often controlled with smartphones. Smart locks are used in coworking spaces and offices to enable keyless office entry. In addition, electronic locks cannot be picked with conventional tools. == Locksmithing == Locksmith, 1451 Locksmithing is a traditional trade, and in most countries requires completion of an apprenticeship. The level of formal education required varies from country to country, from no qualifications required at all in the UK, to a simple training certificate awarded by an employer, to a full diploma from an engineering college. Locksmiths may be commercial (working out of a storefront), mobile (working out of a vehicle), institutional, or investigational (forensic locksmiths). They may specialize in one aspect of the skill, such as an automotive lock specialist, a master key system specialist or a safe technician. Many also act as security consultants, but not all security consultants have the skills and knowledge of a locksmith. Historically, locksmiths constructed or repaired an entire lock, including its constituent parts. The rise of cheap mass production has made this less common; the vast majority of locks are repaired through like-for-like replacements, high-security safes and strongboxes being the most common exception. Many locksmiths also work on any existing door hardware, including door closers, hinges, electric strikes, and frame repairs, or service electronic locks by making keys for transponder-equipped vehicles and implementing access control systems. Although the fitting and replacement of keys remains an important part of locksmithing, modern locksmiths are primarily involved in the installation of high quality lock-sets and the design, implementation, and management of keying and key control systems. Locksmiths are frequently required to determine the level of risk to an individual or institution and then recommend and implement appropriate combinations of equipment and policies to create a \\"security layer\\" that exceeds the reasonable gain of an intruder. ===Key duplication=== Video showing the process of cutting a key Traditional key cutting is the primary method of key duplication. It is a subtractive process named after the metalworking process of cutting, where a flat blank key is ground down to form the same shape as the template (original) key. The process roughly follows these stages: # The original key is fitted into a vise in a machine, with a blank attached to a parallel vise which is mechanically linked. # The original key is moved along a guide in a movement which follows the key's shape, while the blank is moved in the same pattern against a cutting wheel by the mechanical linkage between the vices. # After cutting, the new key is deburred by scrubbing it with a metal brush to remove particles of metal which could be dangerously sharp and foul locks. Modern key cutting replaces the mechanical key following aspect with a process in which the original key is scanned electronically, processed by software, stored, then used to guide a cutting wheel when a key is produced. The capability to store electronic copies of the key's shape allows for key shapes to be stored for key cutting by any party that has access to the key image. Different key cutting machines are more or less automated, using different milling or grinding equipment, and follow the design of early 20th century key duplicators. Key duplication is available in many retail hardware stores and as a service of the specialized locksmith, though the correct key blank may not be available. More recently, online services for duplicating keys have become available. == Symbolism == alt= ===Heraldry=== Keys appear in various symbols and coats of arms, the best- known being that of the Holy See ‚Äì derived from the phrase in which promises Saint Peter, in Roman Catholic tradition the first pope, the Keys of Heaven.

Directed by Roland Joff√© and written by Robert Bolt, the film stars Robert De Niro, Jeremy Irons, Ray McAnally, Aidan Quinn, Cherie Lunghi, and Liam Neeson. It won the Cannes Film Festival Palme d'Or and the Academy Award for Best Cinematography. In April 2007, it was elected number one on the Church Times Top 50 Religious Films list. Furthermore, it is one of fifteen films listed in the category \\"Religion\\" on the Vatican film list. The music, scored by Italian composer Ennio Morricone, ranked 1st on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's (ABC) Classic 100 Music in the Movies. ==Plot== In the 1740s, Spanish Jesuit priest Father Gabriel enters the northeastern Argentina and eastern Paraguayan jungle to build a mission station and convert a Guaran√≠ community to Christianity. The Guaran√≠ are not initially receptive to Christianity or outsiders in general, and they tie a priest to a wooden cross and send him over the Iguazu Falls. Father Gabriel travels to the falls, climbs to the top, and plays his oboe. One of the Guaran√≠ warriors, seeing that the stranger is European, breaks the oboe, throws it down into the water, then stalks off. Father Gabriel does not react, however, and the impressed Guarani, who were captivated by the music, allow him to live. Mercenary and slaver Rodrigo Mendoza makes his living kidnapping natives such as the Guarani community and selling them to nearby plantations, including the plantation of the Spanish Governor Don Cabeza. After returning from another kidnapping trip, Mendoza is told by his assumed fianc√©e, Carlotta, that she loves his younger half-brother Felipe. Mendoza later finds them in bed together and in a fit of rage kills Felipe in a duel. Although he is acquitted of the killing of Felipe, Mendoza spirals into depression. Father Gabriel visits and challenges Mendoza to undertake a suitable penance. Mendoza accompanies the Jesuits on their return journey, dragging a heavy bundle containing his armour and sword. After initially tense moments upon reaching the outskirts of the natives' territory, since they recognize their former persecutor, the natives soon come to embrace a tearful Mendoza and cut away his heavy bundle. Father Gabriel's mission is depicted as a place of sanctuary and education for the Guaran√≠. Moved by the Guaran√≠'s acceptance, Mendoza wishes to help at the mission and Father Gabriel gives him a Bible. In time, Mendoza takes vows and becomes a Jesuit under Father Gabriel and his colleague Father Fielding. The Jesuit missions were safe, because they were protected under Spanish law. The Treaty of Madrid (1750) reapportioned South American land on which the Jesuit missions were located, transferring the area to the Portuguese, who allowed slavery. The Portuguese colonials seek to enslave the natives, and as the independent Jesuit missions might impede this, Papal emissary Cardinal Altamirano, a former Jesuit priest, is sent from the Vatican to survey the missions and decide which, if any, should be allowed to remain. Under pressure from both Cabeza and Portuguese representative Hontar, Cardinal Altamirano is forced to choose between two evils. If he rules in favour of the colonists, the indigenous peoples will become enslaved; if he rules in favour of the missions, the entire Jesuit Order may be condemned by the Portuguese and the European Catholic Church could fracture. Altamirano visits the missions and is amazed at their industry and success, both in converting the Indians and, in some cases, economically. At Father Gabriel's mission of San Carlos, he tries to explain the reasons behind closing the mission and instructs the Guaran√≠ that they must leave, because it is God's will. The Guaran√≠ question the validity of his claim, and argue God's will was to settle and develop the mission. Father Gabriel and Mendoza, under threat of excommunication, state their intention to defend the mission alongside the Guaran√≠ if the plantation owners and colonists attack. They are, however, divided on how to do this, and they debate how to respond to the impending military attack. Father Gabriel believes that violence is a direct crime against God. Mendoza, however, decides to break his vows by militarily defending the Mission. Against Father Gabriel's wishes, he teaches the natives the European art of war and once more takes up his sword. When a joint Portuguese and Spanish force attacks, the mission is initially defended by Mendoza, Fielding, and the Guaran√≠. They are no match for the military force, and Mendoza is shot and fatally wounded after the soldiers destroy a trap, allowing them to enter the village. Fielding sacrifices himself by killing the Portuguese commander before he is killed. Upon seeing the church at the mission village the soldiers become reluctant to fire. When the soldiers enter the mission village, they encounter the singing of Father Gabriel and the Guaran√≠ women and children who march in the procession. Father Gabriel leads, carrying a monstrance with the Blessed Sacrament. Ignoring this, the Spanish commander orders the attack; Father Gabriel, the rest of the priests and most of the Guaran√≠, including women and children, are gunned down. After Father Gabriel is shot, a child picks up the Blessed Sacrament and leads the procession. Only a handful escape into the jungle. In a final exchange between Cardinal Altamirano and Hontar, Hontar laments that what happened was unfortunate but inevitable: \\"We must work in the world; the world is thus.\\" Altamirano rejoins: \\"No, thus have we made the world. Thus have I made it.\\" Days later, a canoe of young children return to the scene of the Mission massacre and salvage a few belongings. They set off up the river, going deeper into the jungle, with the thought that the events will remain in their memories. A final title declares that many priests have continued to fight for the rights of indigenous people into the present day.

A significant subtext is the impending suppression of the Jesuits, of which Father Gabriel is warned by the film's narrator, Cardinal Altamirano, who was once himself a Jesuit. Altamirano, speaking in hindsight in 1758, corresponds to the actual Andalusian Jesuit Father Luis Altamirano, who was sent by Jesuit Superior General Ignacio Visconti to Paraguay in 1752 to transfer territory from Spain to Portugal. He oversaw the transfer of seven missions south and east of the R√≠o Uruguay, that had been settled by Guaran√≠ and Jesuits in the 17th century. As compensation, Spain promised each mission 4,000 pesos, or fewer than 1 peso for each of the approximately 30,000 Guaran√≠ of the seven missions, while the cultivated lands, livestock, and buildings were estimated to be worth 7‚Äì16 million pesos. The film's climax is the Guaran√≠ War of 1754‚Äì1756, during which historical Guaran√≠ defended their homes against Spanish-Portuguese forces implementing the Treaty of Madrid. For the film, a re-creation was made of one of the seven missions, S√£o Miguel das Miss√µes.James Schofield Saeger (1995) \\"The Mission and Historical Missions: Film and the Writing of History.\\" The Americas, Vol. 51, No. 3, pp. 393‚Äì415. Father Gabriel's character is loosely based on the life of Paraguayan saint and Jesuit Roque Gonz√°lez de Santa Cruz. The story is taken from the book The Lost Cities of Paraguay by Father C. J. McNaspy, S.J., who was also a consultant on the film. The waterfall setting of the film suggests the combination of these events with the story of older missions, founded between 1610‚Äì1630 on the Paranapanema River above the Gua√≠ra Falls, from which Paulista slave raids forced Guaran√≠ and Jesuits to flee in 1631. The battle at the end of the film evokes the eight-day Battle of Mboror√© in 1641, a battle fought on land as well as in boats on rivers, in which the Jesuit-organised, firearm-equipped Guaran√≠ forces stopped the Paulista raiders. ===Historical inaccuracies=== The historical Altamirano was not a cardinal sent by the Pope, but an emissary sent by the Superior General of the Society of Jesus, Ignacio Visconti, to preserve the Jesuits in Europe in the face of attacks in Spain and Portugal. ==Filming locations== The film was mostly filmed in Colombia, Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay. The tunnels of Fort Amherst in Kent were used as part of the monastery where Mendoza (Robert De Niro) was held. ==Soundtrack== The soundtrack for The Mission was written by Ennio Morricone. Beginning with a liturgical piece (\\"On Earth as It Is in Heaven\\") which becomes the 'Spanish' theme, it moves quickly to the 'Guaran√≠' theme, which is written in a heavily native style and uses several indigenous instruments. Later, Morricone defines The Mission theme as a duet between the 'Spanish' and \\"Guaran√≠\\" themes. The soundtrack was recorded at CTS Lansdowne Studios in London. Other themes throughout the movie include the 'Penance', 'Conquest', and 'Ave Maria Guaran√≠' themes. In the latter, a large choir of indigenous people sing a rendition of the \\"Ave Maria\\". ==ReceptionBox Office=== The film grossed $17.2 million at the US and international box office against a budget of ¬£16.5 million, which at the time was the US equivalent of $25.4 million, making this film a commercial flop. Goldcrest Films invested ¬£15,130,000 in the film and received ¬£12,250,000 in returns, netting Goldcrest a ¬£2,880,000 loss. ===Critical=== The Mission received mixed reviews from critics. The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 64% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 25 reviews, with an average rating of 6.32/10. The site's critics consensus reads, \\"The Mission is a well-meaning epic given delicate heft by its sumptuous visuals and a standout score by Ennio Morricone, but its staid presentation never stirs an emotional investment in its characters.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 55 out of 100 based on 18 critic reviews, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". ==Awards and honours== Academy Awards *Best Picture ‚Äì Fernando Ghia and David Puttnam (nominated) *Best Director ‚Äì Roland Joff√© (nominated) *Best Art Direction ‚Äì Stuart Craig and Jack Stephens (nominated) *Best Cinematography ‚Äì Chris Menges (won) *Best Costume Design ‚Äì Enrico Sabbatini (nominated) *Best Film Editing ‚Äì Jim Clark (nominated) *Best Original Score ‚Äì Ennio Morricone (nominated) BAFTA Film Awards *Best Film ‚Äì Fernando Ghia, David Puttnam and Roland Joff√© (nominated) *Best Director ‚Äì Roland Joff√© (nominated) *Best Actor in a Supporting Role ‚Äì Ray McAnally (won) *Best Original Screenplay ‚Äì Robert Bolt (nominated) *Best Cinematography ‚Äì Chris Menges (nominated) *Best Costume Design ‚Äì Enrico Sabbatini (nominated) *Best Film Editing ‚Äì Jim Clark (won) *Best Film Music ‚Äì Ennio Morricone (won) *Best Production Design ‚Äì Stuart Craig (nominated) *Best Sound ‚Äì Ian Fuller, Bill Rowe and Clive Winter (nominated) *Best Special Visual Effects ‚Äì Peter Hutchinson (nominated) Cannes Film Festival *Palme d'Or ‚Äì Roland Joff√© (won) *Technical Grand Prize ‚Äì Roland Joff√© (won) Golden Globe Awards *Best Motion Picture ‚Äì Drama (nominated) *Best Director ‚Äì Roland Joff√© (nominated) *Best Actor in a Motion Picture ‚Äì Drama ‚Äì Jeremy Irons (nominated) *Best Screenplay ‚Äì Robert Bolt (won) *Best Original Score ‚Äì Ennio Morricone (won) ===Others=== The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists: * 2005: AFI's 100 Years of Film Scores ‚Äì #23 ==See also== *Iguazu Falls ==References* *The Mission at the Arts & Faith Top100 Spiritually Significant Films list Category:1986 films Category:British films Category:Films directed by Roland Joff√© Category:Films set in Brazil Category:Films set in Paraguay Category:Films set in jungles Category:Palme d'Or winners Category:Films about religion Category:Films about Catholicism Category:British historical films Category:1980s historical films Category:Goldcrest Films films Category:English-language films Category:Films set in the 1750s Category:Spanish-language films Category:Latin-language films Category:Society of Jesus Category:Films with screenplays by Robert Bolt Category:Films about Catholic priests Category:Films whose cinematographer won the Best Cinematography Academy Award Category:Films shot in Foz do Igua√ßu Category:Films shot in Colombia Category:Films set in South America Category:British epic films Category:Films about hunter-gatherers Category:Indigenous cinema in Latin America Category:Films scored by Ennio Morricone Category:Films produced by David Puttnam Category:Fratricide in fiction ","title":"The Mission (1986 film)"},{"id":"525495","text":"Louis IX may refer to: * Louis IX of France (1214‚Äì1270) * Louis IX, Duke of Bavaria \\"the Rich\\" (1417‚Äì1479) * Louis IX, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt (ruled 1768‚Äì1790) ","title":"Louis IX (disambiguation)"},{"id":"525502","text":"Louis VI may refer to: * Louis VI of France, \\"the Fat\\" (1081‚Äì1137) * Louis VI the Roman (1328‚Äì1365), Duke of Bavaria and Elector of Brandenburg * Louis VI, Elector Palatine (ruled 1576‚Äì1583) * Louis VI of Hesse-Darmstadt (ruled 1661‚Äì1678) * Louis VI, Prince of Cond√© (1756‚Äì1830).

This mission, San Francisco's oldest standing building, is located in the northwest area of the neighborhood. ==Location and climate== The Mission District is located in east-central San Francisco. It is bordered to the east by U.S. Route 101, which forms the boundary between the eastern portion of the district, known as \\"Inner Mission\\", and its eastern neighbor, Potrero Hill. Sanchez Street separates the neighborhood from Eureka Valley (containing the sub-district known as \\"the Castro\\") to the north west and Noe Valley to the south west. The part of the neighborhood from Valencia Street to Sanchez Street, north of 20th Street, is known as the \\"Mission Dolores\\" neighborhood. South of 20th Street towards 22nd Street, and between Valencia and Dolores Streets is a distinct neighborhood known as Liberty Hill.Liberty Hill Neighborhood Association . Libertyhillsf.org. Cesar Chavez Street (formerly Army Street) is the southern border; across Cesar Chavez Street is the Bernal Heights neighborhood. North of the Mission District is the South of Market neighborhood, bordered roughly by Duboce Avenue and the elevated highway of the Central Freeway which runs above 13th Street. The principal thoroughfare of the Mission District is Mission Street. South of the Mission District, along Mission Street, are the Excelsior and Crocker-Amazon neighborhoods, sometimes referred to as the \\"Outer Mission\\" (not to be confused with the actual Outer Mission neighborhood). The Mission District is part of San Francisco's supervisorial districts 6, 9 and 10. The Mission is often warmer and sunnier than other parts of San Francisco. The microclimates of San Francisco create a system by which each neighborhood can have different weather at any given time, although this phenomenon tends to be less pronounced during the winter months. The Mission's geographical location insulates it from the fog and wind from the west. This climatic phenomenon becomes apparent to visitors who walk downhill from 24th Street in the west from Noe Valley (where clouds from Twin Peaks in the west tend to accumulate on foggy days) towards Mission Street in the east, partly because Noe Valley is on higher ground whereas the Inner Mission is at a lower elevation. The Mission includes four recognized sub-districts. The northeastern quadrant, adjacent to Potrero Hill is known as a center for high tech startup businesses including some chic bars and restaurants. The northwest quadrant along Dolores Street is famous for Victorian mansions and the popular Dolores Park at 18th Street. Two main commercial zones, known as the Valencia corridor (Valencia St, from about 15th to 22nd) and the 24th Street corridor known as Calle 24 in the south central part of the Mission District are both very popular destinations for their restaurants, bars, galleries and street life. ==HistoryNative Peoples and Spanish Colonization=== Prior to the arrival of Spanish missionaries, the area which now includes the Mission District was inhabited by the Ohlone people who populated much of the San Francisco bay area. The Yelamu Indians inhabited the region for over 2,000 years. Spanish missionaries arrived in the area during the late 18th century. They found these people living in two villages on Mission Creek. It was here that a Spanish priest named Father Francisco Pal√≥u founded Mission San Francisco de Asis on June 29, 1776. The Mission was moved from the shore of Laguna Dolores to its current location in 1783. Franciscan friars are reported to have used Ohlone slave labor to complete the Mission in 1791. This period marked the beginning of the end of the Yelamu culture. The Indian population at Mission Dolores dropped from 400 to 50 between 1833 and 1841. === San Francisco's southern expansion === Pioneer Race Course 1853, the grandstands shown were located just south of 24th and Shotwell St. Ranchos owned by Spanish-Mexican families such as the Valenciano, Guerrero, Dolores, Bernal, No√© and De Haro continued in the area, separated from the town of Yerba Buena, later renamed San Francisco (centered around Portsmouth Square) by a two-mile wooden plank road (later paved and renamed Mission Street). The lands around the nearly abandoned mission church became a focal point of raffish attractionsVia magazine, April 2003. Viamagazine.com (July 23, 2010). including bull and bear fighting, horse racing, baseball and dueling. A famous beer parlor resort known as The Willows was located along Mission Creek just south of 18th Street between Mission Street and San Carlos Street.\\"The Willows & 18th St. Ravine in 3D and 1860s Mission Amusements\\". Burritojustice.com. March 10, 2010 From 1865 to 1891, a large conservatory and zoo known as Woodward's Gardens covered two city blocks bounded by Mission Street, Valencia Street, 13th Street, and 15th Street. In the decades after the Gold Rush, the town of San Francisco quickly expanded, and the Mission lands were developed and subdivided into housing plots for working-class immigrants, largely German, Irish, and Italian, and also for industrial uses. As the city grew in the decades following the Gold Rush, the Mission District became home to the first professional baseball stadium in California, opened in 1868 and known as Recreation Grounds seating 17,000 people which was located at Folsom and 25th Streets; a portion of the grounds remain as present day Garfield Square.‚ÄúThe Mission Has Always Been The Home of Baseball‚Äù, BurritoJustice.com, February 17, 2010 Also, in the 20th century, the Mission District was home to two other baseball stadiums, Recreation Park located at 14th and Valencia and Seals Stadium located at 16th and Bryant with both these stadiums being used by the baseball team named after the Mission District known as the Mission Reds and the San Francisco Seals. ===Earthquake and population shifts=== Corner of Beale and Mission Streets, San Francisco, c. 1863 During California's early statehood period, in the 19th and 20th century, large numbers of Irish and German immigrant workers moved into the area. Around 1900, the Mission District was still one of San Francisco's least densely populated areas, with most of the inhabitants being white families from the working class and lower middle class who lived in single-family houses and two-family flats. Development and settlement intensified after the 1906 earthquake, as many displaced businesses and residents moved into the area, making Mission Street a major commercial thoroughfare. In 1926, the Polish community of San Francisco converted a church on 22nd Street and Shotwell Street and opened its doors as the Polish Club of San Francisco; it is referred to today as the \\"Dom Polski\\", or Polish Home. The Irish American community made its mark on the area during this time, with notable residents such as etymologist Peter Tamony calling the Mission home. During the 1940-1960s, a large number of Mexican immigrants moved into the area‚Äîdisplaced from an earlier \\"Mexican Barrio\\" located on Rincon Hill in order to create the western landing of the Bay Bridge‚Äîinitiating white flight, giving the Mission a heavily Chicano/Latino character for which it continues to be known today. During the 1960s, Central American immigration has contributed to a Central American presence that outnumbers Mexicans since the 1960s. ===1970s‚Äì1990s=== The Women's Building. Street murals and paintings of Latin American culture by local artists are a common feature and attraction. In the 1960s and 1970s, the Chicano/Latino population in the western part of the Mission (including the Valencia Corridor) declined somewhat and more middle-class young people moved in, including gay and lesbian people (alongside the existing LGBTQ Latino population). From the mid-1970s through the 1980s, the Valencia Street corridor included one of the most concentrated and visible lesbian neighborhoods in the United States. The Women's Building and The Lexington Club were part of that community. In the late 1970s and early 1980s the Valencia Street corridor had a lively punk nightlife featuring the bands The Offs, The Avengers, the Dead Kennedys, Flipper, and several clubs including The Offensive, The Deaf Club, Valencia Tool & Die and The Farm. The former fire station on 16th Street, called the Compound, sported what was commonly referred to as \\"the punk mall\\", an establishment that catered to punk style and culture. On South Van Ness, Target Video and Damage magazine were located in a three-story warehouse. The former Hamms brewery was converted to a punk living/rehearsal building, popularly known as The Vats. The neighborhood was dubbed \\"the New Bohemia\\" by the San Francisco Chronicle in 1995. In the 1980s and 1990s, the neighborhood received a higher influx of immigrants and refugees from Central America, South America, the Middle East and even the Philippines and former Yugoslavia, fleeing civil wars and political instability at the time. These immigrants brought in many Central American banks and companies which would set up branches, offices, and regional headquarters on Mission Street. === 1990s‚Äìpresent === From the late 1990s through the 2010s, and especially during the dot-com boom, young urban professionals, moved into the area. It is widely believed that their movement initiated gentrification, raising rent and housing prices. A number of Latino American middle-class families as well as artists moved to the Outer Mission area, or out of the city entirely to the suburbs of East Bay and South Bay area. Despite rising rent and housing prices, many Mexican and Central American immigrants continue to reside in the Mission, although the neighborhood's high rents and home prices have led to the Latino population dropping by 20% over the decade until 2011.\\"Upscale culture and gang violence share a small space\\". Los Angeles Times. (September 21, 2011). However, in 2008 the Mission still had a reputation of being artist-friendly.\\"36 Hours in San Francisco\\", New York Times, September 14, 2008 The Mission remains the cultural nexus and epicenter of San Francisco's Mexican/Chicano, and to a lesser extent, the Bay Area's Nicaraguan, Salvadoran and Guatemalan community. While Mexican, Salvadoran, and other Latin American businesses are pervasive throughout the neighborhood, residences are not evenly distributed. Of the neighborhood's Chicano/Latino residents, most live on the eastern and southern sides. The western and northern sides of the neighborhood are more affluent and white. sfgate.com As of 2017, the northern part of the Mission, together with the nearby Tenderloin, is home to a Mayan-speaking community, consisting of immigrants who have been arriving since the 1990s from Mexico's Yucat√°n region. Their presence is reflected in the Mayan-language name of In Chan Kaajal Park, opened in 2017 north of 17th Street between Folsom and Shotwell Street. ==Landmarks and features== left Roxie Theater, 16th Street and Valencia Street Mission District's annual Day of the Dead celebration, Garfield Square Dolores Park is a popular recreation area.

The San Francisco Armory is a castle-like building located at 14th and Mission that was built as an armory for the U.S. Army and California National Guard. It served as the Headquarters of the 250th Coast Artillery from 1923 through 1944, and the 49th Infantry, also known as the 49ers, in the Cold War. From 2006 to 2018, it was the headquarters of BDSM porn production company Kink.com. ===Food=== The Mission district is also famous and influential for its restaurants. Dozens of taquer√≠as are located throughout the neighborhood, showcasing a localized styling of Mexican food. San Francisco is the original home of the Mission burrito.Bittman, Mark. (May 11, 2010) \\"In the Mission District, a Great Cheap Lunch\\". The New York Times, May 11, 2010. There is also a high concentration of Salvadoran, Guatemalan, and Nicaraguan restaurants there as well as a large number of street food vendors. In the last couple decades a number of Mission restaurants have gained national attention, most notably the five restaurants who have received Michelin stars for 2017: Commonwealth, Lazy Bear, Aster, Californios, and Al's Place. A large number of other restaurants are also popular, including: Mission Chinese Food, Western Donut, Mission Pie, Bar Tartine, La Taqueria, Papalote, Foreign Cinema on Mission Street, and Delfina on 18th.Bittman, Mark (May 29, 2011). \\"San Francisco‚Äôs New Pop-Up Restaurant\\".

These organizations were founded during the social and cultural renaissance of the late 1960s and early 1970s. Latino community artists and activists of the time organized to create community- based arts organizations that were reflective of the Latino aesthetic and cultural traditions. The Mission Cultural Center for the Latino Arts, established by Latino artists and activists, is an art space that was founded in 1976 in a space that was formerly a furniture store. The local bilingual newspaper El Tecolote was founded in 1970. The Mission's Galer√≠a de la Raza, founded by local artists active in el Movimiento (the Chicano civil rights movement), is a nationally recognized arts organization, also founded during this time of cultural and social renaissance in the Mission, in 1971. Late May, the city's annual Carnaval festival and parade marches down Mission Street. Inspired by the festival in Rio de Janeiro, it is held in late May instead of the traditional late February to take advantage of better weather. The first Carnaval in San Francisco happened in 1978, with less than 100 people dancing in a parade that went around Precita Park. Alejandro Murgu√≠a (born 1949) is an American poet, short story writer, editor and filmmaker who was named San Francisco Poet Laureate in 2012. He is known for his writings about the Mission District where he has been a long-time resident. Due to the existing cultural attractions, formerly less expensive housing and commercial space, and the high density of restaurants and drinking establishments, the Mission is a magnet for young people. An independent arts community also arose and, since the 1990s, the area has been home to the Mission School art movement. Many studios, galleries, performance spaces, and public art projects are located in the Mission, including 1890 Bryant St Studios, Southern Exposure, Art Explosion Studios, City Art Collective Gallery, Artists' Television Access, Savernack Street, and the oldest, alternative, not-for- profit art space in the city of San Francisco, Intersection for the Arts. There are more than 500 Mission artists listed on Mission Artists United site put together by Mission artists. The Roxie Theater, the oldest continuously operating movie theater in San Francisco, is host to repertory and independent films as well as local film festivals. Poets, musicians, emcees, and other artists sometimes gather on the southwest corner of the 16th and Mission intersection to perform. Dance Mission Theater is a nonprofit performance venue and dance school in the neighborhood as well.  Murals  Throughout the Mission walls and fences are decorated with murals initiated by the Chicano Art Mural Movement of the 1970s and inspired by the traditional Mexican paintings made famous by Diego Rivera. Some of the more significant mural installations are located on Balmy Alley and Clarion Alley. Many of these murals have been painted or supported by the Precita Eyes muralist organization.  Music scene  The Mission is rich in musical groups and performances. Mariachi bands play in restaurants throughout the district, especially in the restaurants congregated around Valencia and Mission in the northeast portion of the district. Carlos Santana spent his teenage years in the Mission, graduating from Mission High School in 1965. He often returned to the neighborhood, including for a live concert with his band Santana that was recorded in 1969,CD Universe, ''Santana S.F. Mission District Live '69 CD''.

Mission Local is predominantly an online news site but does publish a semiannual printed paper. And El Reportero is a weekly newspaper that also has an online site. === Transit === The neighborhood is served by the BART rail system with stations on Mission Street at 16th Street and 24th Street, by Muni bus numbers 9, 9R, 12, 14, 14R, 22, 27, 33, 48, 49, 67, and along the western edge by the J Church Muni Metro line, which runs down Church Street and San Jose Avenue. === Gentrification === The Mission District in the San Francisco Bay Area is a historic transit hub for the Chicano and the Latino community, especially on the 16th Street BART Plaza. An atmosphere like a public market with live music and food trucks, it is also a commuting point for public transportation, which primarily serves low-income working-class people. The majority of the residents that live in Mission District are of minorities and low-income families and uses this useful and open hub for gatherings and doing local businesses like food trucks. However, because of the Dot-Com Boom that occurred in the 1990s and the rise of technology and social media, major technology companies like Google and Facebook have moved up their offices to places like Silicon Valley, south of the bay, that have now become the hot spot for tech companies. The Mission has felt the downstream effects of this demographic shift acutely. The intense surge in demand for housing and low supply of available housing has placed upward pressure on rents in transit hubs like the Mission, leading to gentrification and the displacement of families and small businesses. However, many residents protested and engaged in activism. They created a group called the ‚ÄúPlaza 16 Coalition‚Äù in response to the gentrification and the new zoning law, the ‚ÄúEastern Neighborhoods Plan‚Äù. They advocate for affordable housing, opposing market-rate developments and the luxury developments. ==Education== San Francisco Unified School District operates public schools. Schools in the Mission District include: * John O'Connell High School * Buena Vista Horace Mann K-8 Community School * Bryant Elementary School * C√©sar Ch√°vez Elementary School * Leonard R. Flynn Elementary School * Marshall Elementary School * George R. Moscone Elementary School - it had 350 students. * Zaida T. Rodriguez Early Education School * Hilltop Special Service Center (special school for grades 7-12) The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Francisco operates the St. Peter's Catholic School, which opened in 1878. Previously its students were Irish or Italian American, but by 2014 95% of the student body was Latino and about two thirds were categorized as economically disadvantaged. Enrollment was once around 600 but by 2014 was around 300 due to gentrification. Its yearly per-student cost was $5,800 while yearly tuition, the lowest in the archdiocese, was $3,800. \\\\- Alternate link at the Houston Chronicle ==See also== * 826 Valencia * Intersection for the Arts * The Lexington Club * Tartine ‚Äì local bakery * The Redstone Building ==Further reading== *Hooper, Bernadette (2006).

Literally meaning \\"reclaimed land\\", it lies near the Sumida River on land reclaimed from Tokyo Bay in the 18th century, during the Edo period. There are also districts named Tsukiji in Kobe and Amagasaki, cities in Hy≈çgo Prefecture, although neither is as well known as the district in Tokyo. ==History== Tsukiji is built on reclaimed land out of what were once lowland marshes along the Sumida River delta. Throughout the Tokugawa period, earth from the shogunate's extensive moat and canal excavations was systematically used to fill in the marshes along the river, creating new commercial districts and waterfront housing. The land was then named Tsukiji (ÁØâÂú∞), meaning \\"constructed land\\" or \\"reclaimed land\\". The Great Fire of Meireki of 1657 destroyed over two-thirds of Edo's buildings, including Hongan-ji temple in Asakusa, the enormous Kant≈ç headquarters of the J≈çdo Shinsh≈´ sect.\\"The Genesis of Tsukiji\\", Tsukiji Sushi Workshop. Retrieved on 29 October 2014. As a result, the temple site was relocated to Tsukiji, where many of the residents of nearby Tsukudajima were instrumental in its reconstruction. A number of other temples were also erected on what is now the outer marketplace. In addition, many private residences for samurai and feudal lords were constructed along the southern edge of Tsukiji. In 1869, Tsukiji was designated as an approved residential area for foreigners. As the Yokohama foreign settlement, opened in 1859, had already become a center for commercial activities and international trade, Tsukiji grew more as a focus for education, healthcare and Christian mission work. Early classroom and study facilities for Keio University, Rikkyo University, St. Margaret's Junior College, the American School in Japan and St. Luke's International Hospital were all to be found in this district. The United States legation occupied a site in Tsukiji from 1875 to 1890; it is now occupied by the St. Luke's Garden complex. The American legation had been moved from an old temple in Azabu, by Minister John Bingham, prominent Reconstruction era Ohio congressman and the longest serving American chief of mission to serve in Japan. Tsukiji Naval Academy hot air balloon demonstration (1877) Hiroshige IIITsukiji was also the location from 1869 of the Imperial Japanese Navy technical training facilities, renamed in 1876 as the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy. In 1888, the Naval Academy was relocated from Tsukiji to new, larger facilities at Etajima in Hiroshima Prefecture. The Tsukiji naval buildings next to the Akibashi bridge then became home, until 1923, of the Naval War College, a post-graduate staff college for senior naval officers. The Great Kant≈ç earthquake on September 1, 1923, and the resultant fires which raged in its aftermath, caused severe damage throughout central Tokyo. A significant portion of the Tsukiji district burned to the ground, and the old Nihonbashi fish market was razed. In the citywide restructuring following the quake, the Nihonbashi fish market was relocated to the Tsukiji district, and after the construction of a modern market facility, reopened in 1935. ==Places of interest== Tsukiji fish market Tsukiji Hongan-ji * For many residents and visitors to Tokyo, the Central Wholesale Market, better known as the Tsukiji fish market is synonymous with sushi, sashimi and seafood products of every kind.

In baseball, the term manager used without qualification almost always refers to the field manager, not the general manager. Before the 1960s, and in some rare cases today, a person with the general manager title in sports has also borne responsibility for the non-player operations of the ballclub, such as ballpark administration and broadcasting. Ed Barrow, George Weiss and Gabe Paul were three baseball GMs noted for their administrative skills in both player and non-player duties. ==History and evolution== In the first decades of baseball's post-1901 modern era, responsibilities for player acquisition fell with the club owner and/or president and the field manager. In some cases, particularly in the early years of the American League, the owner was a former player or manager himself: Charles Comiskey of the Chicago White Sox, Connie Mack of the Philadelphia Athletics, and Clark Griffith of the Washington Senators are three prominent examples. Other owners tended to be magnates from the business world, or some, like Brooklyn Dodgers' president Charles Ebbets, worked their way from front-office jobs into ownership positions. Most deferred player personnel evaluations to their on-field managers. One notable exception, cited by Mark L. Armour and Daniel R. Leavitt in their book In Pursuit of Pennants, was German immigrant Barney Dreyfuss, owner of the Pittsburgh Pirates from 1900‚Äì1932. Dreyfuss had no playing background, but was one of the most astute judges of talent of his time; under him, Pittsburgh won six National League pennants and two World Series titles. The New York Giants' John McGraw, who also held a minority ownership stake in the team, is an example of a powerful manager who, during his three decades at the Giants' helm, exerted control over off-field aspects of the team's operation. According to Baseball Almanac, the first man to hold the title of general manager was Billy Evans when he was appointed by the Cleveland Indians in 1927.Baseball Almanac.com However, the duties of the modern general manager already had been assumed by two executives ‚Äî Barrow of the New York Yankees and Branch Rickey of the St. Louis Cardinals ‚Äî whose formal title at the time was business manager. Both were former field managers of big-league teams, although Barrow had no professional playing background.National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum official web site, Edward Grant BarrowLeavitt, Daniel R., Ed Barrow. Society for American Baseball Research Biography Project They assumed those positions (Barrow in 1920 and Rickey five years later) when clubs could legally control only 15 minor league players on option, and most young players were purchased or drafted from independently owned minor league teams. Rickey, creator of the modern and extensive farm system during the 1920s and 1930s, played a critical role in inventing the need for a general manager as well: with most teams coming to own or affiliate with multiple minor league teams from Class D to the top tier, and with dozens (and in some cases hundreds) of players under contract, they needed a front-office infrastructure to oversee the major league club, scouting and player procurement, minor league operations and player development, and business affairs. The general manager, in lieu of the \\"owner-operator\\", provided that oversight. But both the owner-operator and the field-manager-as-GM models would survive into the 1980s. Owners Charlie Finley of the Oakland Athletics and Calvin Griffith of the Minnesota Twins functioned as their own chiefs of baseball operations. During the 1970s and 1980s, Alvin Dark of the Cleveland Indians, Billy Martin of the Athletics (after Finley sold them in 1981), and Whitey Herzog of the Cardinals combined manager and general manager duties, while Paul Owens of the Philadelphia Phillies and Jack McKeon of the San Diego Padres were general managers who appointed themselves field managers and held both posts. ==Trend towards \\"presidents of baseball operations\\"== During the second decade of the 21st century, a trend began in Major League Baseball that saw the creation of a new layer of authority between ownership and the general manager, almost always termed the President of Baseball Operations. In some cases, these \\"POBOs\\" work in concert with others in the organization styled as presidents, but with non-baseball-centric responsibilities, like President/CEO or /COO. Wrote Sports Business Daily in March 2015: \\"No longer is it always true that the GM is the final decision-maker with respect to baseball decisions.\\"Wong, Glenn (16 March 2015), \\"How Leadership Shift Has Changed MLB Front Offices,\\" Sports Business Daily Larry Beinfest of the Florida Marlins was the first to hold the POBO title, in 2007. One of the reasons for the creation of this new position cited by SBD in 2015 is the soaring costs and revenues associated with modern MLB operations. \\"Ownership is often heavily involved in major investments and decisions ... Installing another layer creates a sort of checks and balances system and a checkpoint for the decision-making process.\\" Three months later, the same publication and author (Professor Glenn M. Wong of the University of Massachusetts‚ÄìAmherst) revisited the topic and compared the evolving job descriptions and career trajectories of general managers and POBOs.Wong, Glenn (15 June 2015), \\"Profiling MLB Club Leadership: Presidents v. General Managers,\\" Sports Business Daily In 2016, SBD writer Eric Fisher cited the growing importance of data analytics in playing personnel evaluations and long-term planning (in addition to in game strategy), and heavier investments in player development, domestically and internationally, as contributing to the POBO movement and other structural changes in baseball front offices.Fisher, Eric (21 March 2016), \\"Who Calls the Shots? Baseball's Burgeoning Front Offices,\\" Sports Business Daily The 2019 Baseball America Annual Directory listed 12 presidents of baseball operations among the 30 MLB teams, as well as one \\"chief baseball officer\\" and four \\"executive vice presidents of baseball operations\\" operating above the general manager level or also holding the GM title.Lowe, Kegan, and Norris, Josh, editors (2019), Baseball America Annual Directory.

Claims of alien activity there first arose from Albuquerque businessman Paul Bennewitz. ==History== Starting in 1979, Bennewitz became convinced he was intercepting electronic communications from alien spacecraft and installations outside of Albuquerque. By the 1980s he believed he had discovered a secret underground base near Dulce populated by grey aliens and humans. The story spread rapidly within the UFO community and by 1987, UFOlogist John Lear claimed he had independent confirmations of the base's existence. In 1988, the tabloid Weekly World News published a story entitled \\"UFO Base Found in New Mexico\\" which claimed that \\"diabolical invaders from another solar system have set up a secret underground base in the rugged mountains of northern New Mexico ‚Äì so they can shanghai human guinea pigs for bizarre genetic experiments\\". The Weekly World News story used supposed quotes from UFOlogist Leonard Stringfield as a source for its claims. Upon learning of the story, Stringfield protested, \\"I never read such a distortion of facts in my life\\". Political scientist Michael Barkun writes that Cold War underground missile installations in the area gave superficial plausibility to the rumors, making the Dulce base story an \\"attractive legend\\" within UFOlogy. According to Barkun, claims about experiments on abductees and firefights between aliens and the Delta Force place the Dulce legend \\"well outside even the most far-fetched reports of secret underground bases.\\" Residents of Dulce claim to have seen UFOs, moving lights, and other unexplained sightings in the area. Jicarilla Apache Legislative Council president Ty Vicenti \\"has embraced the notion of a Dulce Base, partly in a push to stimulate tourism\\", and in 2016, the town hosted the Dulce Base UFO Conference at the local casino hotel. ==References== ==Further reading== *Gregory J.

It can also be used with data that contains non-permitted octets or line lengths exceeding SMTP limits. It is defined as a MIME content transfer encoding for use in e-mail. QP works by using the equals sign \`=\` as an escape character. It also limits line length to 76, as some software has limits on line length. ==Introduction== MIME defines mechanisms for sending other kinds of information in e-mail, including text in languages other than English, using character encodings other than ASCII. However, these encodings often use byte values outside the ASCII range so they need to be encoded further before they are suitable for use in a non-8-bit-clean environment. Quoted-Printable encoding is one method used for mapping arbitrary bytes into sequences of ASCII characters. So, Quoted-Printable is not a character encoding scheme itself, but a data coding layer to be used under some byte- oriented character encoding. QP encoding is reversible, meaning the original bytes and hence the non-ASCII characters they represent can be identically recovered. Quoted-Printable and Base64 are the two MIME content transfer encodings, if the trivial \\"7bit\\" and \\"8bit\\" encoding are not counted. If the text to be encoded does not contain many non-ASCII characters, then Quoted- Printable results in a fairly readableThis implies that an ASCII compatible encoding is used. A QP-encoded text in e.g. EBCDIC would not be readable of course. and compact encoded result. On the other hand, if the input has many 8-bit characters, then Quoted-Printable becomes both unreadable and extremely inefficient. Base64 is not human-readable, but has a uniform overhead for all data and is the more sensible choice for binary formats or text in a script other than the Latin script. ==Quoted-Printable encoding== Any 8-bit byte value may be encoded with 3 characters: an \`=\` followed by two hexadecimal digits (\`0\`‚Äì\`9\` or \`A\`‚Äì\`F\`) representing the byte's numeric value. For example, an ASCII form feed character (decimal value 12) can be represented by \\"\`=0C\`\\", and an ASCII equal sign (decimal value 61) must be represented by \`=3D\`. All characters except printable ASCII characters or end of line characters (but also \`=\`) must be encoded in this fashion. All printable ASCII characters (decimal values between 33 and 126) may be represented by themselves, except \`=\` (decimal 61, hexadecimal 3D, therefore \`=3D\`). ASCII tab and space characters, decimal values 9 and 32, may be represented by themselves, except if these characters would appear at the end of the encoded line. In that case, they would need to be escaped as \`=09\` (tab) or \`=20\` (space), or be followed by a \`=\` (soft line break) as the last character of the encoded line. This last solution is valid because it prevents the tab or space from being the last character of the encoded line. If the data being encoded contains meaningful line breaks, they must be encoded as an ASCII CR LF sequence, not as their original byte values, neither directly nor via \`=\` signs. Conversely, if byte values 13 and 10 have meanings other than end of line (in media types,Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part One: Format of Internet Message Bodies. November 1996. RFC 2045 # 6.7 Quoted- Printable Content-Transfer-Encoding, part \\"(4) (Line Breaks)\\". Retrieved March 18, 2013. for example), then they must be encoded as \`=0D\` and \`=0A\` respectively. Lines of Quoted-Printable encoded data must not be longer than 76 characters. To satisfy this requirement without altering the encoded text, soft line breaks may be added as desired. A soft line break consists of an \`=\` at the end of an encoded line, and does not appear as a line break in the decoded text. These soft line breaks also allow encoding text without line breaks (or containing very long lines) for an environment where line size is limited, such as the 1000 characters per line limit of some SMTP software, as allowed by RFC 2821. A slightly modified version of Quoted-Printable is used in message headers; see MIME#Encoded-Word. ==Example== The following example is a French text (encoded in UTF-8), with a high frequency of letters with diacritical marks (such as the √©).

People trained to orient by echolocation can interpret the sound waves reflected by nearby objects, accurately identifying their location and size. ==Background== The term \\"echolocation\\" was coined by zoologist Donald Griffin in 1944; however, reports of blind humans being able to locate silent objects date back to 1749. Human echolocation has been known and formally studied since at least the 1950s.Richard L. Welsh, Bruce B. Blasch, online Foundations of Orientation and Mobility, American Foundation for the Blind, 1997; which cites S. O. Myers and C. G. E. G. Jones, \\"Obstable experiments: second report\\", Teacher for the Blind 46, 47‚Äì62, 1958. In earlier times, human echolocation was sometimes described as \\"facial vision\\" or \\"obstacle sense,\\" as it was believed that the proximity of nearby objects caused pressure changes on the skin.Raymond J Corsini, The Dictionary of Psychology, Psychology Press (UK), 1999, .M. Supa, M. Cotzin, and K. M. Dallenbach. \\"Facial Vision\\" - The Perception of Obstacles by the Blind. The American Journal of Psychology, April 1944.Cotzin and Dallenbach. \\"Facial Vision\\": The Role of Pitch and Loudness in the Location of Obstacles by the Blind. The American Journal of Psychology, October 1950. Only in the 1940s did a series of experiments performed in the Cornell Psychological Laboratory show that sound and hearing, rather than pressure changes on the skin, were the mechanisms driving this ability. The field of human and animal echolocation was surveyed in book form as early as 1959.Griffin, Donald R., Echos of Bats and Men, Anchor Press, 1959 (Science and Study Series, Seeing With Sound Waves) See also White, et al. (1970)White, J. C., Saunders, F. A., Scadden, L., Bach-y-Rita, P., & Collins, C. C. (1970). Seeing with the skin. Perception & Psychophysics, 7, 23-27. Many blind individuals passively use natural environmental echoes to sense details about their environment; however, others actively produce mouth clicks and are able to gauge information about their environment using the echoes from those clicks. Both passive and active echolocation help blind individuals learn about their environments. Because sighted individuals learn about their environments using vision, they often do not readily perceive echoes from nearby objects. This is due to an echo suppression phenomenon brought on by the precedence effect. However, with training, sighted individuals with normal hearing can learn to avoid obstacles using only sound, showing that echolocation is a general human ability. ==Mechanics== Vision and hearing are closely related in that they can process reflected waves of energy. Vision processes light waves as they travel from their source, bounce off surfaces throughout the environment and enter the eyes. Similarly, the auditory system processes sound waves as they travel from their source, bounce off surfaces and enter the ears. Both systems can extract a great deal of information about the environment by interpreting the complex patterns of reflected energy that they receive. In the case of sound, these waves of reflected energy are called \\"echoes\\". Echoes and other sounds can convey spatial information that is comparable in many respects to that conveyed by light. With echoes, a blind traveler can perceive very complex, detailed, and specific information from distances far beyond the reach of the longest cane or arm. Echoes make information available about the nature and arrangement of objects and environmental features such as overhangs, walls, doorways and recesses, poles, ascending curbs and steps, planter boxes, pedestrians, fire hydrants, parked or moving vehicles, trees and other foliage, and much more. Echoes can give detailed information about location (where objects are), dimension (how big they are and their general shape), and density (how solid they are). Location is generally broken down into distance from the observer and direction (left/right, front/back, high/low). Dimension refers to the object's height (tall or short) and breadth (wide or narrow). By understanding the interrelationships of these qualities, much can be perceived about the nature of an object or multiple objects. For example, an object that is tall and narrow may be recognized quickly as a pole. An object that is tall and narrow near the bottom while broad near the top would be a tree. Something that is tall and very broad registers as a wall or building. Something that is broad and tall in the middle, while being shorter at either end may be identified as a parked car. An object that is low and broad may be a planter, retaining wall, or curb. And finally, something that starts out close and very low but recedes into the distance as it gets higher is a set of steps. Density refers to the solidity of the object (solid/sparse, hard/soft). Awareness of density adds richness and complexity to one's available information. For instance, an object that is low and solid may be recognized as a table, while something low and sparse sounds like a bush; but an object that is tall and broad and very sparse is probably a fence. ===Brain areas associated with echolocation=== Echo-related activity in the brain of an early-blind echolocator is shown on the left. There is no activity evident in the brain of a sighted person (shown on the right) listening to the same echoes Some blind people are skilled at echolocating silent objects simply by producing mouth clicks and listening to the returning echoes, for example Ben Underwood. Although few studies have been performed on the neural basis of human echolocation, those studies report activation of primary visual cortex during echolocation in blind expert echolocators. The driving mechanism of this brain region remapping phenomenon is known as neuroplasticity. In a 2014 study by Thaler and colleagues [SOURCE NEEDED], the researchers first made recordings of the clicks and their very faint echoes using tiny microphones placed in the ears of the blind echolocators as they stood outside and tried to identify different objects such as a car, a flag pole, and a tree. The researchers then played the recorded sounds back to the echolocators while their brain activity was being measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Remarkably, when the echolocation recordings were played back to the blind experts, not only did they perceive the objects based on the echoes, but they also showed activity in those areas of their brain that normally process visual information in sighted people, primarily primary visual cortex or V1. This result is surprising, as visual areas, as their names suggest, are only active during visual tasks. The brain areas that process auditory information were no more activated by sound recordings of outdoor scenes containing echoes than they were by sound recordings of outdoor scenes with the echoes removed. Importantly, when the same experiment was carried out with sighted people who did not echolocate, these individuals could not perceive the objects and there was no echo-related activity anywhere in the brain. This suggests that the cortex of blind echolocators is plastic and reorganizes such that primary visual cortex, rather than any auditory area, becomes involved in the computation of echolocation tasks. Despite this evidence, the extent to which activation in the visual cortex in blind echolocators contributes to echolocation abilities is unclear. As previously mentioned, sighted individuals have the ability to echolocate; however, they do not show comparable activation in visual cortex. This would suggest that sighted individuals use areas beyond visual cortex for echolocation. ==Notable cases of human echolocationDaniel Kish=== Echolocation has been further developed by Daniel Kish, who works with the blind through the non-profit organization World Access for the Blind. He leads blind teenagers hiking and mountain-biking through the wilderness, and teaches them how to navigate new locations safely, with a technique that he calls \\"FlashSonar\\". Kish had his eyes removed at the age of 13 months due to retinal cancer. He learned to make palatal clicks with his tongue when he was still a child‚Äîand now trains other blind people in the use of echolocation and in what he calls \\"Perceptual Mobility\\". Though at first resistant to using a cane for mobility, seeing it as a \\"handicapped\\" device, and considering himself \\"not handicapped at all\\", Kish developed a technique using his white cane combined with echolocation to further expand his mobility. Kish reports that \\"The sense of imagery is very rich for an experienced user. One can get a sense of beauty or starkness or whatever‚Äîfrom sound as well as echo.\\" He is able to distinguish a metal fence from a wooden one by the information returned by the echoes on the arrangement of the fence structures; in extremely quiet conditions, he can also hear the warmer and duller quality of the echoes from wood compared to metal. ===Thomas Tajo=== Thomas Tajo was born in the remote Himalayan village of Chayang Tajo in the state of Arunachal Pradesh in the north-east India and became blind around the age of 7 or 8 due to optic nerve atrophy. Tajo taught himself to echolocate. Today he lives in Belgium and works with Visioneers or World Access to impart independent navigational skills to blind individuals across the world. Tajo is also an independent researcher. He researches the cultural and biological evolutionary history of the senses and presents his findings to the scientific conferences around the world. ===Ben Underwood=== Ben Underwood Ben Underwood was a blind American who was born on January 26, 1992 in Riverside, California. He was diagnosed with retinal cancer at the age of two, and had his eyes removed at the age of three. morgan isdell aleks petcova even white thomas cian Humans With Amazing Senses ‚Äî ABC News. He taught himself echolocation at the age of five, becoming able to detect the location of objects by making frequent clicking noises with his tongue. This case was explained in 20/20: Medical Mysteries. He used it to accomplish such feats as running, playing basketball, riding a bicycle, rollerblading, playing football, and skateboarding.The Boy Who Sees with Sound ‚Äî People magazine He attended school at Edward Harris Jr. Middle School. Underwood's childhood eye doctor claimed that Underwood was one of the most proficient human echolocators. Underwood died on January 19, 2009 at the age of 16, from the same cancer that took his vision. ===Tom De Witte=== Tom De Witte was born in 1979 in Belgium with bilateral congenital glaucoma. It had seemed that he would become a successful flautist until he had to give up playing music in 2005. De Witte has been completely blind since 2009 due to additional problems with his eyes. He was taught echolocation by Daniel Kish and was given the nickname \\"Batman from Belgium\\" by the press. ===Dr. Lawrence Scadden=== Scadden has written of his experiences with blindness.Surpassing Expectations: Life Without Sight Scadden, Lawrence] He was not born blind, but lost his sight due to illness. As a child, he learned to use echolocation well enough to ride a bicycle in traffic. (His parents thought that he still had some sight remaining.) He later participated in experiments in facial vision. In about 1998, he visited the Auditory Neuroethology Laboratory at the University of Maryland and was interviewed about his experience with facial vision. The researchers in the lab study bat echolocation and were aware of the Wiederorientierung phenomenon described by Griffin (1959), where bats, despite continuing to emit echolocation calls, use path integration in familiar acoustic space. Scadden indicated that he found echolocation required extra effort, and would not use it to navigate in familiar areas unless he was alert for obstacles, thus providing insight into the bat behavior. The Regional Alliance of Science, Engineering and Mathematics for Students with Disabilities (RASEM) and the Science Education for Students With Disabilities (SESD), a Special Interest Group of the National Science Teachers Association (NSTA) have created the Lawrence A. Scadden Outstanding Teacher Award of the Year for Students With Disabilities in his honor. ===Lucas Murray=== Lucas Murray (born c. 2002), from Poole, Dorset, was born blind, but is one of the first British people to learn human echolocation. By the echo caused by clicking his tongue on the roof of his mouth, Murray can identify how close objects are, and what they are made of. He was taught the technique by Daniel Kish. Murray was born in Poole in Dorset with complex medical needs including septo-optic dysplasia. He was blind from birth but this was not confirmed until he was five months old. At this stage his parents, Sarah and Iain, believed his blindness would cause him problems. However, Sarah and Iain watched a documentary about a young American called Ben Underwood, a boy who used echo-location that he had taught himself to a very high level. In the documentary, Daniel Kish, founder of the World Access for the Blind charity, spoke about not only echo-location but the importance of a Long Cane. Many months after seeing the documentary on television, Sarah discovered that Daniel would be visiting a Scottish Charity called Visibility, so contacted him and asked if he could visit Lucas. Daniel Kish, a 41-year-old blind Californian, alongside Brian Bushway from World Access for the Blind, taught the basics of echo-location and the importance of a suitable Long Cane to Lucas over the course of four days in 2007. Sarah says that the echo-location and \\"No Limits Approach\\" has given Lucas a \\"fantastic future\\". His parents have set up a charity called Common Sense, which aims to provide support for parents and carers of visually impaired children. They also offer long white canes to children in the UK, through The Common Sense Children's Cane Bank. In 2019 he enjoyed a week's work experience with South Western Railway. Using echolocation Lucas' mother Sarah said that, at seven years old, his independence was improving almost every day, and he could play with other children in sports such as rock climbing and basketball. Lucas identifies the distance of objects by timing the time that the echo from him clicking takes to return, and from the sound which bounces back he can also tell the density and shape, Lucas is the first British pupil to receive a comprehensive program in advanced echo-location. similar to echolocation and the use of sonar to picture surroundings used by bats. Kish is reported to have said that Lucas' \\"mobility is amazing\\", and that he is the \\"best for his age in the UK\\". However, Kish wrote to Lucas' parents and other reporters, unpublished, that he actually said, \\"Lucas' mobility is among the best in the U.K. for his age in my experience.\\" Lucas says that he really likes the system. Lucas also uses a Long White cane to find objects near his feet. He uses an AmbuTech Telescopic Cane because it is light in weight and has a ceramic tip. At the proper length, it comes up to his nose when upright. ===Kevin Warwick=== The scientist Kevin Warwick experimented with feeding ultrasonic pulses into the brain (via electrical stimulation from a neural implant) as an additional sensory input. In tests he was able to discern distance to objects accurately and to detect small movements of those objects.Warwick K, Hutt B, Gasson M, and Goodhew I. \\"An attempt to extend human sensory capabilities by means of implant technology\\". Proc. IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man. and Cybernetics - Hawaii October 2005. pp.1663-1668 ===Juan Ruiz=== Blind from birth, Juan Ruiz lives in Los Angeles, California. He appeared in the first episode of Stan Lee's Superhumans, titled \\"Electro Man\\". The episode showed him capable of riding a bicycle, avoiding parked cars and other obstacles, and identifying nearby objects. He entered and exited a cave, where he determined its length and other features. ==In popular mediaToph Beifong=== Toph is a fictional girl from the animated series Avatar: The Last Airbender who uses a highly advanced form of echolocation, made possible through a technique called \\"earthbending\\" (telekinetic manipulation of elemental earth). Born blind, she has developed hyper-sensitive mechanoreceptors and is able to feel minute vibrations well enough to create an accurate picture of her surroundings such that she is a competent fighter, though vulnerable when her opponents are airborne. She later uses this hypersensitivity to develop the art of metalbending while teaching Avatar Aang to earthbend. Using her extremely refined abilities, she can also sense the vibrations of a person's heart-rate and breath-rate, effectively becoming a human polygraph. ===Perception=== The 2017 video game Perception places the player in the role of a blind woman who must use echolocation to navigate the environment. ===The Last of Us=== In Naughty Dog's 2013 PlayStation 3 game, The Last of Us, infected people called \\"clickers\\" use echolocation. ===Imagine=== In the 2012 movie Imagine, the main character teaches echolocation to students at clinic for the visually impaired. This unconventional method spurs a controversy but helps students explore the world. ===Daredevil=== Matthew Murdock is a defense attorney by day and a crime-fighting vigilante by night, going by the name Daredevil, from Marvel Comics. He was involved in an accident as a child where his eyes came in contact with radioactive chemicals, effectively blinding him though it did enhance his other senses (smell, hearing and touch) to superhuman levels. If he concentrates hard enough, he is able to hear a person's cry for help from blocks away. Like Toph Beifong, he can use his super-hearing to detect a person's heartbeat as well as minute changes of their breath rate and tone of voice, thus also becoming a human lie detector. Also like Toph, he uses his abilities to his advantage in combat. == Artificially stimulated echolocation for blind humans  Currently ongoing research === Project BATEYE fundamentally uses an ultrasonic sensor mounted onto a wearable pair of glasses that measures the distance to the nearest object and relays it to an Arduino board. The Arduino board then processes the measurements and then plays a tone (150‚Äì15000 Hz) for the respective distance (2 cm to 4 m) till the data from the next ultrasonic pulse (distance) comes in. This cycle is repeated almost every 5 milliseconds. The person hears sound that changes according to the distance to the nearest object. The head provides a 195-degree swivel angle and the ultrasonic sensor detects anything within a 15-degree angle. Using systematic, cognitive and computational approach of neuroscience, with the hypothesis that the usage of the occipital lobe of blind people goes into processing other sensory feedback, and using the brain as a computational unit, the machine relies on the brain processing the tone produced every 14 msec to its corresponding distance and producing a soundscape corresponding to the tones and the body navigating using the same. During experimentation, the test subject could detect obstacles as far away as 2‚Äì3 m, with horizontal or vertical movements of the head the blindfolded test subject could understand the basic shape of objects without touching them, and the basic nature of the obstacles. Similar research could potentially revolutionize navigation abilities of blind humans. Other studies have been done to better understand how humans are able to discriminate between modalities using clicks. One recent study used spectral analysis to classify frequencies of echoes from different textured materials. The paper posits that understanding the discrimination ability of human echolocators will allow for more sophisticated sonar and radar technology. Also, their work can eventually contribute to more innovation in human echolocator aid devices. These could benefit human echolocators who are practicing this technique and assist them in achieving the most accurate results possible. The experimental set up utilizes one blind subject with a high proficiency in human echolocation due to losing their sight to retinoblastoma at 13 months of age and utilizing echolocation in their day-to-day activities. They clicked at objects of hard, medium, or soft textures at varying distances. The degradation of sound intensity due to distance was controlled for in the mathematical analysis. Also, all of the objects had the same surface area in order to control for the effect it has on sound intensity and sound pressure level. The echo signals were extracted from the recordings via the equation below where d is the distance between the target and the speaker‚Äìmicrophone, t is the time it took for the echo to reach the microphone, Œ∏ is the target‚Äôs angle of elevation from the speaker‚Äìmicrophone, and C is the speed of sound in air, which equals 342 m/s. d = [0.5(C¬∑t)]cosŒ∏ This equation also allowed the experimenters to estimate theoretical values for and echo‚Äôs t. The results grouped into clusters using K-means clustering and K-nearest neighbor processes. The results showed a clear separation between the echoes from different textures. ==See also== *Acoustic location *Sensory substitution *Thaandavam, a Tamil film involving human echolocation ==References== ==External links== * How to see with sound Article by Daniel Kish in the New Scientist * Harvard historical study and bibliography * Ben Underwood * Seeing with Sound project * The Blind Man Who Taught Himself To See Men's Journal * Bat Man Reader's Digest * Human Echolocation - Learn to See with your Ears - Free audio lesson for learning to click. * This American Life: Batman (audio) Category:Blindness Category:Sonar ","title":"Human echolocation"},{"id":"525669","text":"The Kolyma basin Kolyma region, arctic northeast Siberia Kolyma (, ) is a region located in the Russian Far East. It is bounded by the East Siberian Sea and the Arctic Ocean in the north and the Sea of Okhotsk to the south. The region gets its name from the Kolyma River and mountain range, parts of which were not discovered by Russians until 1926. Today the region consists roughly of the Chukotka Autonomous Okrug and the Magadan Oblast. The area, part of which is within the Arctic Circle, has a subarctic climate with very cold winters lasting up to six months of the year. Permafrost and tundra cover a large part of the region. Average winter temperatures range from ‚àí19 ¬∞C to ‚àí38 ¬∞C (even lower in the interior), and average summer temperatures, from +3 ¬∞C to +16 ¬∞C. There are rich reserves of gold, silver, tin, tungsten, mercury, copper, antimony, coal, oil, and peat. Twenty-nine zones of possible oil and gas accumulation have been identified in the Sea of Okhotsk shelf. Total reserves are estimated at 3.5 billion tons of equivalent fuel, including 1.2 billion tons of oil and 1.5 billion m3 of gas. The principal town Magadan has nearly 100,000 inhabitants and is the largest port in north-eastern Russia. It has a large fishing fleet and remains open year-round thanks to icebreakers. Magadan is served by the nearby Sokol Airport. There are many public and private farming enterprises. Gold mines, pasta and sausage factories, fishing companies, and a distillery form the city's industrial base. ==Prehistory== During archaeological investigations of Paleolithic sites on the Angara, in 1936 the unique Stone Age site of Buret‚Äô was discovered which yielded an anthropomorphic sculpture, skulls of rhinoceroses, and surface and semisubterranean dwellings. The houses were analogous, on one hand, to Paleolithic European houses and, on the other, to ethnographically studied houses of the Eskimos, Chukchi and Koryaks. The indigenous peoples of this region include the Evens, Koryaks, Yupiks, Chukchis, Orochs, Chuvans and Itelmens, who traditionally lived from fishing along the Sea of Okhotsk coast or from reindeer herding in the River Kolyma valley. ==History== Under Joseph Stalin's rule, Kolyma became the most notorious region for the Gulag labor camps. Tens of thousands or more people may have died en route to the area or in the Kolyma's series of gold mining, road building, lumbering, and construction camps between 1932 and 1954. It was Kolyma's reputation that caused Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, author of The Gulag Archipelago, to characterize it as the \\"pole of cold and cruelty\\" in the Gulag system. The Mask of Sorrow monument in Magadan commemorates all those who died in the Kolyma forced-labour camps and the recently dedicated Church of the Nativity remembers the victims in its iconsIcons. magadancatholic.org and Stations of the Camps.Icons by Svetlana Rjanitcyna. magadancatholic.org ===Emergence of the Gulag camps=== Gold and platinum were discovered in the region in the early 20th century. During the time of the USSR's industrialization (beginning with Joseph Stalin's first five-year plan, 1928‚Äì1932) the need for capital to finance economic development was great. The abundant gold resources of the area seemed tailor-made to provide this capital. A government agency Dalstroy (, acronym for Far North Construction Trust) was formed to organize the exploitation of the area. Prisoners were being drawn into the Soviet penal system in large numbers during the initial period of Kolyma's development, most notably from the so-called anti-Kulak campaign and the government's internal war to force collectivization on the USSR's peasantry. These prisoners formed a readily available workforce. Butugychag Tin Mine ‚Äì A Gulag camp in the Kolyma area The initial efforts to develop the region began in 1932, with the building of the town of Magadan by forced labor. (Many projects in the USSR were already using forced labor, most notably the White Sea-Baltic Canal.) After a gruelling train ride on the Trans-Siberian Railway prisoners were disembarked at one of several transit camps (such as Nakhodka and later Vanino) and transported across the Sea of Okhotsk to the natural harbor chosen for Magadan's construction. Conditions aboard the ships were harsh. According to a 1987 articleJackson, James O. (20 April 1987) Soviet Union. Time in Time Magazine: \\"During the 1930s the only way to reach Magadan was by ship from Khabarovsk, which created an island psychology and the term Gulag archipelago. Within the crowded prison ships thousands died during transportation. One survivor's memoir recounts that the prison ship SS Dzhurma was caught in the autumn ice in 1933 while trying to get to the mouth of the Kolyma River. When it reached port the following spring, it carried only crew and guards. All 12,000 prisoners were missing, left dead on the ice.\\" It turns out that this incident, widely reported since it was first mentioned in a book published in 1947, could not have happened as the ship Dzhurma was not in Soviet hands until mid 1935. In 1932 expeditions pushed their way into the interior of the Kolyma, embarking on the construction of the Kolyma Highway, which was to become known as the Road of Bones. Eventually, about 80 different camps dotted the region of the uninhabited taiga. The original director of the Kolyma camps was Eduard Berzin, a Cheka officer. Berzin was later removed (1937) and shot during the period of the Great Purges in the USSR. The Arctic camps Prisoners at a Kolyma gold mine At the height of the Purges, around 1937, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's account quotes camp commander Naftaly Frenkel as establishing the new law of the Archipelago: \\"We have to squeeze everything out of a prisoner in the first three months‚Äîafter that we don't need him anymore.\\"Solzhenitsyn, A. The Gulag Archipelago, vol. 2, p. 49. The system of hard labor and minimal or no food reduced most prisoners to helpless \\"goners\\" (dokhodyaga, in Russian). Conditions varied depending on the state of the country. Many of the prisoners in Kolyma were academics or intellectuals. They included Mikhail Kravchuk (Krawtschuk), a Ukrainian mathematician who by the early 1930s had received considerable acclaim in the West. After a summary trial, apparently for reluctance to take part in the accusations of some of his colleagues, he was sent to Kolyma where he died in 1942. Hard work in the labor camp, harsh climate and meager food, poor health as well as accusations and abandonment by most of his colleagues, took their toll. Kravchuk perished in Magadan in Eastern Siberia, about 4,000 miles (6,000 km) from the place where he was born. Kravchuk's last article had appeared soon after his arrest in 1938. However, after this publication, Kravchuk's name was stricken from books and journals.Krawtchouk story : How a scientist received a job offer from the American Mathematical Society, was accused of being a foreign spy, and sent to GULAG. gmu.edu The prisoner population of Kolyma increased substantially in 1946 with the arrival of thousands of former Soviet POWs liberated by Western Allied forces or the Red Army at the close of World War II.Conquest, Robert, Kolyma: The Arctic Death Camps, Viking Press, (1978), , pp. 228‚Äì229 Those judged guilty of collaboration with the enemy frequently received ten or twenty-five year prison sentences to the gulag, including Kolyma. There were, however, some exceptions. Rumor suggested that Soviet agents seized L√©on Theremin, an inventor, in the United States and forced him to return to the Soviet Union; he actually returned voluntarily. Joseph Stalin had Theremin imprisoned at the Butyrka in Moscow; he later came to work in the Kolyma gold mines. Although rumors of his execution circulated widely, Theremin was, in fact, put to work in a sharashka (a secret research- laboratory), together with other scientists and engineers, including aircraft designer Andrei Tupolev and rocket scientist Sergei Korolyov (also a Kolyma inmate). The Soviet Union rehabilitated Theremin in 1956. The Kolyma camps switched to using (mostly) free labor after 1954, and in 1956 Nikita Khrushchev ordered a general amnesty that freed many prisoners. Various estimates have put the Kolyma death-toll from 1930 to the mid 1950s between 250,000 and over a million people. Dalstroy officials Dalstroy was the agency created to manage exploitation of the Kolyma area, based principally on the use of forced labour. In the words of Azerbaijani prisoner Ayyub Baghirov, \\"The entire administration of the Dalstroy ‚Äì economic, administrative, physical and political‚Äîwas in the hands of one person who was invested with many rights and privileges.\\" The officials in charge of Dalstroy, i.e., the Kolyma Gulag camps were: * Eduard Petrovich Berzin, 1932‚Äì1937 * Karp Aleksandrovich Pavlov, 1937‚Äì1939. * Ivan Fedorovich Nikishev, 1940‚Äì1948. * Ivan Grigorevich Petrenko, 1948‚Äì1950. * I.L.

In 1953, the Magadan Oblast (or region) was established. Dalstroy was transferred to the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Metallurgy and later to the Ministry of Non- Ferrous Metallurgy. Industrial and economic evolution Industrial gold- mining started in 1958 leading to the development of mining settlements, industrial enterprises, power plants, hydro-electric dams, power transmission lines and improved roads. By the 1960s, the region's population exceeded 100,000. With the dissolution of Dalstroy, the Soviets adopted new labor policies. While the prison labor was still important, it mainly consisted of common criminals. New manpower was recruited from all Soviet nationalities on a voluntary basis, to make up for the sudden lack of political prisoners. Young men and women were lured to the frontier land of Kolyma with the promise of high earnings and better living. But many decided to leave. The region's prosperity suffered under Soviet liberal policies in the end of the 1980s and 1990s with a considerable reduction in population, apparently by 40% in Magadan.Yakutia ASSR and the Sakha Republic from Cosmic Elk. Retrieved 23 January 2007. A U.S. report from the late 1990s gives details of the region's economic shortfall citing outdated equipment, bankruptcies of local companies and lack of central support. It does however report substantial investments from the United States and the governor's optimism for future prosperity based on revival of the mining industries.Kuzmichenko, Svetlana (1998) Magadan Region Update, U.S. & Foreign Commercial Service and U.S. Department of State. Last political prisoners Dalstroy and the camps did not close down completely. The Kolyma authority, which was reorganised in 1958/59 (31 December 1958), finally closed in 1968. However the mining activities did not stop. Indeed, government structures still exist today under the Ministry of Natural Resources. In some cases, the same individuals seem to have stayed on over the years under new management. There are indications that the political prisoners were gradually phased out over the years but it was only as a result of Boris Yeltsin's far reaching reforms in the 1990s that the very last prisoners were released from Kolyma. The Russian author Andrei Amalrik appears to have been one of the last high-profile political prisoners to be sent to Kolyma. In 1970, he published two books: Will the Soviet Union Survive Until 1984? and Involuntary Journey to Siberia. As a result, he was arrested for \\"defaming the Soviet state\\" in November 1970 and sentenced to hard labour, apparently in Kolyma, for what turned out to be a total of almost five years.John Keep: Andrei Amalrik and \\"1984\\", Russian Review, Vol. 30, No.4.

In Dry Rations he writes: \\"Each time they brought in the soup... it made us all want to cry. We were ready to cry for fear that the soup would be thin. And when a miracle occurred and the soup was thick we couldn‚Äôt believe it and ate it as slowly as possible. But even with thick soup in a warm stomach there remained a sucking pain; we‚Äôd been hungry for too long. All human emotions‚Äîlove, friendship, envy, concern for one‚Äôs fellow man, compassion, longing for fame, honesty‚Äîhad left us with the flesh that had melted from our bodies....\\" During and after the Second World War the region saw major influxes of Ukrainians, Polish, German, Japanese, and Korean prisoners. There is a particularly memorable account written by a Jewish Romanian survivor, Michael M. Solomon, in his book Magadan (see Bibliography below) which gives us a vivid picture of both the transit camps leading to the Kolyma and the region itself. Hungarian George Bien, author of the Lost Years, also recounts the horrors of Kolyma.George Bien, Gulag Survivor in the Boston Globe, 22 June 2005 His story has also led to a film.Documentary film Walk on Gulagland Kolyma by Zoltan Szalkai. Retrieved 17 January 2007. Soviet Gold, the first autobiographical book written by Vladimir Nikolayevich Petrov, is almost entirely a description of the author's life in Magadan and the Kolyma gold fields. In Bitter Days of Kolyma, Ayyub Baghirov, an Azerbaijani accountant who was finally rehabilitated, provides details of his arrest, torture and sentencing to eight (finally to become 18) years imprisonment in a labour camp for refusing to incriminate a fellow official for financial irregularities. Describing the train journey to Siberia, he writes: \\"The terrible heat, the lack of fresh air, the unbearable overcrowded conditions all exhausted us. We were all half starved. Some of the elderly prisoners, who had become so weak and emaciated, died along the way. Their corpses were left abandoned alongside the railroad tracks.\\" A vivid account of the conditions in Kolyma is that of Brother Gene Thompson of Kiev's Faith Mission. He recounts how he met Vyacheslav Palman, a prisoner who survived because he knew how to grow cabbages. Palman spoke of how guards read out the names of those to be shot every evening. On one occasion a group of 169 men were shot and thrown into a pit. Their fully clothed bodies were found after the ice melted in 1998.Thompson, Gene (2002) Kolyma ‚Äì The Road of Death. missionreporter.org One of the most famous political prisoners in Kolyma was Vadim Kozin, possibly Russia's most popular romantic tenor, who was sent to the camps in February 1945, apparently for refusing to write a song about Stalin. Although he was initially freed in 1950 and could return to his singing career, he was soon framed by his enemies on charges of homosexuality and sent back to the camps. Though released once again several years later, he was never officially rehabilitated and remained in exile in Magadan where he died in 1994. Speaking to journalists in 1982, he explained how he had been forced to tour the camps: \\"The Polit bureau formed brigades which would, under surveillance, go on tours of the concentration camps and perform for the prisoners and the guards, including those of the highest rank.\\"Vadim Kozin, One Way Trip from Petersburg to Magadan from the Little Russia in US site.

But he does have a plea: \\"Some may say that the Gulag is a forgotten part of history and that we do not need to be reminded. But I have witnessed monstrous crimes. It is not too late to talk about them and reveal them. It is essential to do so. Some have expressed fear on seeing some of my paintings that I might end up in Kolyma again‚Äîthis time for good.

My paintings may help achieve this.\\" The Jamestown Foundation provides access to all 50 of Getman's paintings together with explanations of their significance.Nikolai Getman: The Gulag collection . Retrieved 13 February 2007. ===Estimating the number of victims=== The amount of hard evidence in regard to Kolyma is extremely limited. Unfortunately, no reliable archives exist about the total number of victims of Stalinism; all numbers are estimates. In his book, Stalin (1996), Edvard Radzinsky explains how Stalin, while systematically destroying his comrades-in-arms \\"at once obliterated every trace of them in history. He personally directed the constant and relentless purging of the archives.\\" That practice continued to exist after the death of the dictator. In an account of a visit to Magadan by Harry Wu in 1999, there is a reference to the efforts of Alexander Biryukov, a Magadan lawyer to document the terror. He is said to have compiled a book listing every one of the 11,000 people documented to have been shot in Kolyma camps by the state security organ, the NKVD. Biryukov, whose father was in the Gulag at the time he was born, has begun researching the location of graves. He believed some of the bodies were still partially preserved in the permafrost. It is therefore impossible to provide final figures on the number of victims who died in Kolyma. Robert Conquest, author of The Great Terror, now admits that his original estimate of three million victims was far too high. In his article Death Tolls for the Man-made Megadeaths of the 20th Century,White, Matthew (1998) \\"Worst Massacres of the 20th Century\\" in Historical Atlas of the 20th Century Matthew White estimates the number of those who died at 500,000. In Stalin's Slave Ships, Martin Bollinger undertakes a careful analysis of the number of prisoners who could have been transported by ship to Magadan between 1932 and 1953 (some 900,000) and the probable number of deaths each year (averaging 27%). This produces figures significantly below earlier estimates but, as the author emphasizes, his calculations are by no means definitive. In addition to the number of deaths, the dreadful conditions of the camps and the hardships experienced by the prisoners over the years need to be taken into account. In his review of Bollinger's book, Norman Polmar refers to 130,000 victims who died at Kolyma. As Bollinger reports in his book, the 3,000,000 estimate originated with the CIA in the 1950s and appears to be a flawed estimate. This number is also estimated by the last survivors. Anne Applebaum, a Pulitzer Prize winner, carried out an extensive investigation of the gulags, and explained in a lecture in 2003, that it's extremely difficult not only to document the facts given the extent of the cover-up but to bring the truth home.Gulag: Understanding the Magnitude of What Happened.

Common names include calliopsis and tickseed, a name shared with various other plants. ==Description== These plants range from in height. A common name for Coreopsis is Tickseed. The flowers are usually yellow with a toothed tip. They are also yellow-and red bicolor. The flat fruits are small and dry and look like bugs. Many of its species are cultivated. The 75 to 80 Coreopsis species are native to North, Central, and South America. They have showy flower heads with involucral bracts in two distinct series of eight each, the outer being commonly connate at the base. The name Coreopsis is derived from the Greek words Œ∫œåœÅŒπœÇ (koris), meaning \\"bedbug\\", and ·ΩÑœàŒπœÇ (opsis), meaning \\"view\\", referring to the shape of the achene. ==Uses== Coreopsis, Kansas wildflower Coreopsis species are used as nectar and pollen for insects. The species is known to specifically provide food to caterpillars of some Lepidoptera species including Coleophora acamtopappi. The sunny, summer blooming, daisy-like flowers are popular in gardens to attract butterflies. Both annual and perennials types are grown in the home garden (USDA Hardiness Zone 7a/6b). In this Mid-Atlantic region insects as bees, hover flies, wasps are observed visiting the flowers. All Coreopsis species were designated the state wildflower of Florida in the United States in 1991. In the language of flowers, Coreopsis means to be always cheerful, while Coreopsis arkansa stands for love at first sight. ==Taxonomy== Coreopsis is a variable genus closely related to Bidens. In fact, neither Coreopsis nor Bidens, as defined in the 20th century, is strictly monophyletic. Coreopsis is best described as paraphyletic. Previously (1936) Coreopsis was classified into 11 sections and 114 species, but the African species were subsequently reclassified as Bidens, leaving the North and South American species under Coreopsis, some 75-80 in all. 45 are in the 11 North American sections, and the remaining 35 are in the South American Section Pseudoagarista. The North American species fall into two broad groups, with 5 sections in Mexico and North America (12 species) and the remaining 5 sections in Eastern North America (26 species). One group which does seem to be monophyletic consists of temperate species from North America, including five sections of Coreopsis, Bidens coronata and Bidens tripartita, and the genus Thelesperma (five species). ==Distribution and habitat== Native North American coreopsis can be found in two habitats In the wild they can be found growing along roadsides and open fields throughout the Eastern United States and Canada. In this environment the plant will self-sow. ==Cultivation== Coreopsis can grow in a garden as a border plant, or in a container, preferring well-drained soil. Deadheading the flowers ensures it does not become weedy. Using the USDA Hardiness Zones will identify what soil and climate is preferred for different cultivars or species. Notable species found in cultivation are C. grandiflora, C. verticillata and their various cultivars. == Classification == Coreopsis lanceolata Coreopsis lanceolata === Sections === One classification (GRIN) of the genus consists of eleven sections, shown by cladistic relationships with number of species in parenthesis. :Coreopsis sect.

He was elected to the legislature in 1893 as an independent but worked closely with the Liberal Party. In 1907 he joined the Newfoundland People's Party of Sir Edward Patrick Morris and became minister of finance in 1909. When Morris resigned as party leader Cashin succeeded him. The People's Party had formed a wartime national government which opposition member William F. Lloyd, a Liberal, had joined as minister of justice. Despite the fact that Cashin had succeeded Morris as leader of the dominant party, the governor appointed Lloyd to the position of Prime Minister. On 20 May 1919, Cashin, who was still minister of finance, rose and moved a Motion of No Confidence in the government he was a member of. The motion passed and Cashin became Prime Minister. Cashin's government was short lived however, the House of Assembly had not seen an election for six years due to the First World War and a return to the polls was long overdue. An election was held in November 1919 which defeated Cashin's government and elected the opposition Liberals (now called the Liberal Reform Party). In opposition Cashin changed the name of the People's Party to the Liberal- Labour-Progressive Party before retiring as party leader in 1923. He did not run for re-election in 1924. Cashin's son, Peter John Cashin, was a prominent Newfoundland politician in his own right and his grandson, Richard Cashin was a federal politician in the 1960s and a trade union leader in the 1970s and 1980s.

He is most famous as a public speaker who advocated sovereignty for Quebec from Canada. == Biography == Bourgault was born in East Angus in the Estrie (Eastern Townships) region of Quebec. His father was a civil servant and his mother, a homemaker. His parents sent him to boarding school at age seven, determined that he should receive the education which they lacked. After secondary school, he briefly attended the seminary and entertained the idea of a possible entry into the priesthood, per ancestral tradition, but reneged on his obligation shortly thereafter. He is today entombed within the traditionally Catholic Notre Dame des Neiges Cemetery in Montreal. Beginning in the early 1960s, he supported Quebec independence from Canada and in 1960 joined the pro-independence Rassemblement pour l'ind√©pendance nationale. A famed and inflammatory orator, he led a number of union strikes and marches that resulted in violence. In 1964, he became leader of the RIN, and came up just short in the Duplessis riding of Northern Quebec. During the St. Jean Baptiste celebration in 1968, he and other supporters rioted and threw objects in the direction of newly minted Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. He and 300 others were arrested for this incident, while Trudeau's stoic response significantly helped. In 1968, popular cabinet minister and television host Ren√© L√©vesque founded Mouvement Souverainet√©-Association, a more moderate sovereignist party. L√©vesque rebuffed in an attempt to have the RIN included en masse, fearing the RIN's reputation for protests and violence would hurt the movement. Bourgeault disbanded the party and invited its members to join the MSA one by one and the new Ralliement national in the newly founded Parti Qu√©b√©cois, under L√©vesque's leadership. In the 1970 Quebec election, he was the Parti Qu√©b√©cois candidate in Mercier electoral district, running unsuccessfully against Liberal leader (and soon-to-be Premier) Robert Bourassa, who would become a close personal friend. Bourgault himself did not play any role in the PQ government that came to power in the 1976 Quebec election and was given a patronage appointment. He often quarreled with L√©vesque, especially in the lead up to the 1980 referendum, in which he was a passionate participant, before leaving the PQ in the 1980s. In his early life, he was a journalist at Montreal newspaper La Presse, and he returned to this publication in the 1990s as a columnist for Le Journal de Montr√©al newspaper. After 1976, he was a professor of communications at the Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Montr√©al (UQAM). He was also the co-host or regular columnist of several radio shows aired on la Soci√©t√© Radio-Canada, the French language sector of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. In 1992, he had an acting role in the film L√©olo, cast by director Jean-Claude Lauzon. to whom Bourgault was a mentor.Maurie Alioff, \\"L√©olo,\\" Take One, No. 1, 1992, p. 16. Lauzon denied he was cast for political reasons.Jim Leach, \\"It takes monsters to do things like that: The films of Jean-Claude Lauzon,\\" Great Canadian Film Directors, The University of Alberta Press, 2007, p. 51.

Colostrum gives the milk a yellow hue. Colostrum (known colloquially as beestings,Gottstein, Michael. Colostrum is vital ingredient to keep newborn lambs alive. Irish Independent. 3 March 2009. bisningsPeter Bird, Northamptonshire ACRE 'Village Voices' oral history recordings, Northamptonshire ACRE and Northamptonshire County Archives or first milk) is the first form of milk produced by the mammary glands of mammals (including humans) immediately following delivery of the newborn. Most species will begin to generate colostrum just prior to giving birth. Colostrum has especially high amounts of bioactive compounds compared to mature milk to give the newborn the best possible start to life. Specifically, colostrum contains antibodies to protect the newborn against disease and infection, and immune and growth factors and other bioactives that help to activate a newborn‚Äôs immune system, jumpstart gut function, and seed a healthy gut microbiome in the first few days of life. The bioactives found in colostrum are essential for a newborn‚Äôs health, growth and vitality. At birth,the surroundings of the newborn mammal change from the relatively sterile environment in the mother‚Äôs uterus, with a constant nutrient supply via the placenta, to the microbe rich environment outside with irregular oral intake of complex milk nutrients through the gastrointestinal tract. This transition puts high demands on the gastrointestinal tract of the neonate, as the gut plays an important part in both the digestive system and the immune system. Colostrum has evolved to care for highly sensitive mammalian neonates, and contributes significantly to initial immunological defense as well as to the growth, development, and maturation of the neonate‚Äôs gastrointestinal tract by providing key nutrients and bioactive factors. Colostrum also has a mild laxative effect, encouraging the passing of the baby's first stool, which is called meconium. This clears excess bilirubin, a waste-product of dead red blood cells, which is produced in large quantities at birth due to blood volume reduction from the infant's body and helps prevent jaundice. == Bioactive Components in Colostrum == Newborns have very immature and small digestive systems, and colostrum delivers its bioactives in a very concentrated low-volume form. Colostrum is known to contain immune cells (as lymphocytes) and many antibodies such as IgA, IgG, and IgM. These are some of the components of the adaptive immune system. Other immune components of colostrum include the major components of the innate immune system, such as lactoferrin, lysozyme, lactoperoxidase, complement, and proline-rich polypeptides (PRP). A number of cytokines (small messenger peptides that control the functioning of the immune system) are found in colostrum as well, including interleukins, tumor necrosis factor, chemokines, and others. Colostrum also contains a number of growth factors, such as insulin-like growth factors I (IGF-1), and II, transforming growth factors alpha, beta 1 and beta 2, fibroblast growth factors, epidermal growth factor, granulocyte-macrophage-stimulating growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, and colony-stimulating factor-1. == Human Consumption of Bovine Colostrum == While it‚Äôs long been understood that the colostrum a mother produces is vital to a newborn‚Äôs health in the first few days of life, research has shown that bovine (cow) colostrum and its components can continue to support important biological activities when given to more mature children and adults, so that the benefits of colostrum can extend well beyond the neonatal period of development. Bovine colostrum and human colostrum are highly similar in their makeup, both containing many of the same antibodies, immune and growth factors, and other nutrients. Because they share so many of the same components, the way they work in the body is also highly similar. The benefit of bovine colostrum for human health has been studied in many areas including: * Immune Health: Colostrum is composed of a powerful combination of bioactives that support immune health, including immunoglobulins, immune modulators, and oligosaccharides. These bioactives work together to support not only the immune system, but have also been shown to support respiratory health in adults and children. * Digestive Health: Colostrum is composed of a beneficial combination of bioactives that support digestive health, including immunoglobulins, growth factors, and oligosaccharides. These bioactives work together to maintain and support intestinal integrity and improve nutrient absorption, while its naturally occurring prebiotics feed beneficial bacteria and support a balanced gut in adults and children Mehra R, Sing R, Kumar N, et al. UGC Sponsored National Conference on Food Safety, Nutritional Security and Sustainability. 2020. ISBN 978-81-942875-0- * Early Life Nutrition: While colostrum and breast milk are a critical part of newborn nutrition, research has shown that colostrum has continued benefits in children over the age of one. As a component in early life nutrition, colostrum can help to support children‚Äôs immune systems, soothe digestive upsets, and otherwise support children‚Äôs digestive health.Huppertz HI, Rutkowski S, Busch DH, Eisebit R, Lissner R, Karch H. Journal of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition. 1999;29(4):452-6. * Sports Nutrition: Bovine colostrum contains several bioactives that help support sports nutrition, including immunoglobulins and growth factors. These bioactives combine to help maintain a healthy immune system during the stress during athletic training, while supporting cellular proliferation and restitution as well as protein synthesis and soft tissue repair. ==Colostrum Use in Animal Husbandry== Colostrum is crucial for newborn farm animals. They receive no passive transfer of immunity via the placenta before birth, so any antibodies that they need have to be ingested (unless supplied by injection or other artificial means). The ingested antibodies are absorbed from the intestine of the neonate. The newborn animal must receive colostrum within 6 hours of being born for maximal absorption of colostral antibodies to occur. Recent studies indicate that colostrum should be fed to bovines within the first thirty minutes to maximize IgG absorption rates. The role of colostrum for new born animals is in the provision of nutrition and also essential protection again infection while the immune and digestive systems are developing and maturing. Bovine colostrum provides macro and micro nutrients, as well as growth factors, cytokines, nucleosides, oligosaccharides, natural antimicrobials, antioxidants and a range of immunoglobulins such as IgG, IgA, IgD, IgM and IgE. It is well established that minimal levels of IgG are essential to prevent failure of passive transfer. The iron binding glycoproteins lactoferrin and transferrin in bovine colostrum assist in attacking pathogens by impacting their cell membrane and making them more susceptible to the immune systems attack by neutrophils. Cytokines present in bovine colostrum enhance B and T cell maturation and increase endogenous antibody production. They also play a major role in regulation of epithelial cell growth and development, proliferation, restitution. Transfer factors enhance the activity of T cells. Other growth and immune factors such as IGF-1, IGF-2, FGF, EGF, TGF, PDGF, etc. Bovine colostrum‚Äôs components benefit the immune and digestive health of animals of all ages and species. Bovine colostrum‚Äôs vast array of bioactive components collectively increase resistance to infection and disease caused by a wide range of pathogens including bacteria and viruses. The quality of the colostrum is essential in providing the essential benefits. Both contaminated early bovine colostrum at the farm level or late transition milk or milk are poor sources of the important colostral components necessary to maintain life and achieve and maintain healthy animal maturation and homoeostasis. Bovine colostrum also is beneficial in repairing or healing intestinal damage as well as increasing the absorption of nutrients from the GI tract. These properties and benefits are consistent among human and animal species. The transition from fetal to neonatal and shift from maternal to environmental reliance requires an abrupt immunological change. In calves, for example, colostrum provides a significant benefit in neonatal intestine development. This includes villus area, circumference, height and height/crypt ratio. Colostrum is critically important to calves and foals in order to prevent failure of passive transfer and death. Calves, foals and piglets with low IgG levels have an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Bovine colostrum can be used to reduce the duration and severity of infections so it can be a useful tool to include in the reduction of antibiotic use. Finally, another important and valuable benefit of colostrum is in the reduction in scours and increase in average daily weight gain all of which have a significant farmer and ultimately consumer benefit. == Colostrum Use in Companion Animals == Much like in humans and production animals, companion animal survival in the newborn stage of life is largely dependent upon colostrum. Companion animal immune systems require several weeks to several months in order to fully develop. Maternal antibodies provide benefit for a relatively short period of time so a gap exists with immune sufficiency where an animal is at risk of infection. Like humans, companion animal immune response changes with age where early life and later in life have similarities. That is, an immune bias whereby the animal has less of an ability to fend off infections and greater prevalence of allergy at both ends of the age spectrum. Stress also affects a companion animal‚Äôs immune system including changes in environment, diet, etc. Maintaining gut microbial balance is key to maintaining a healthy immune system as well as mucosal integrity, similar to humans. Bovine colostrum has been demonstrated to benefit companion animal immunity and digestive health. Bovine colostrum plays a role in increasing Ig levels, increasing lymphocyte proliferation stimulating activity and increasing phagocytosis activity. These are supported by other components of colostrum which further enhance the activity of the immune response. The iron binding glycoproteins lactoferrin and transferrin in bovine colostrum assist in attacking pathogens by impacting their cell membrane and making them more susceptible to the immune systems attack by neutrophils. Cytokines present in bovine colostrum enhance B and T cell maturation and increase endogenous antibody production. They also play a major role in regulation of epithelial cell growth and development, proliferation, restitution. Transfer factors enhance the activity of T cells. Other growth and immune factors such as IGF-1, IGF-2, FGF, EGF, TGF, PDGF, etc. Colostrum contains glycomacropeptides which help to regulate appetite . Bovine colostrum has been shown to enhance immune response in animal models including canine, feline and equine animals including maintaining a higher level of vaccine antibody response over time and for a longer period than the vaccine alone. Animals fed colostrum had a significantly higher local immune status resulting in higher IgA through GALT stimulation. Colostrum also plays a key role in reduction or prevention of diarrhea and reduction in respiratory illness. == Bovine Colostrum History of Study and Potential Future Applications == Solidified colostrum in a sweet stall, Salem, Tamil Nadu. Molozyvo‚Äîa traditional dish of Ukrainian cuisine. It is a sweet cheese made of cow colostrum. Dairy cattle are naturally exposed to pathogens and produce immunoglobulins against them. These antibodies are present in the cow‚Äôs bloodstream and in the colostrum. These immunoglobulins are specific to many human pathogens, including Escherichia coli, Cryptosporidium parvum, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella species, Staphylococcus species, and rotavirus (which causes diarrhea in infants). Before the development of antibiotics, colostrum was the main source of immunoglobulins used to fight bacteria. In fact, when Albert Sabin made his first oral vaccine against polio, the immunoglobulin he used came from bovine colostrum. When antibiotics began to appear, interest in colostrum waned, but, now that antibiotic-resistant strains of pathogens have developed, interest is once again returning to natural alternatives to antibiotics, namely, colostrum. Although bovine colostrum has been consumed by humans for centuries,Buttar, H. S., Bagwe, S. M., Bhullar, S. K., & Kaur, G. (2017). Health benefits of bovine colostrum in children and adults. In R. R. Watson, R. J. Collier & V. R. Preedy (Eds.), Dairy in human health and disease across the lifespan (pp. 3-20). London: Academic Press. only in recent decades have we seen an increase in randomized clinical trials to support assertions of health benefits. It is probable that little absorption of intact growth factors and antibodies into the bloodstream occurs, due to digestion in the gastrointestinal tract. However, the presence of casein and other buffering proteins does allow growth factors and other bioactive molecules to pass into the lumen of the small intestine intact, where they can stimulate repair and inhibit microbes, working via local effects. This provides a probable mechanism explaining the positive results of colostrum on adult gut health in several recent well controlled published studies. Evidence for the beneficial effect of colostrum on extra-gastrointestinal problems is less well developed, due in part to the limited number of randomised double-blind studies published, although a variety of possible uses have been suggested. The gut plays several important roles including acting as the main pathway for fluid, electrolyte and nutrient absorption while also acting as a barrier to toxic agents present in the gut lumen including acid, digestive enzymes and gut bacteria. It is also a major immunological defence mechanism, detecting natural commensals and triggering immune response when toxic microbes are present. Failure of homeostasis due to trauma, drugs and infectious microbes not only damages the gut but can lead to influx of damaging agents into the bloodstream. These mechanisms have relevance for multiple conditions affecting all areas of the world and socioeconomic groups such as ulcers, inflammation, and infectious diarrhea. There is currently much interest in the potential value of colostrum for the prevention and treatment of these conditions as it is derived from natural sources and can influence damaging factors through multiple pathways including nutritional support, immunological intervention (through its immunoglobulin and other anti-microbial factors) and growth/healing factor constituents. As pointed out by Kelly, inconsistency between results in some published studies may be due in part to variation in dose given and to the timing of the colostrum collection being tested (first milking versus pooled colostrum collected up to day 5 following calving). Some athletes have used colostrum in an attempt to improve their performance, decrease recovery time, and prevent sickness during peak performance levels.Ray Playford et al. (2011). The nutriceutical, bovine colostrum, truncates the increase in gut permeability caused by heavy exercise in athletes. American Journal of Physiology. Gastrointestinal and Liver Physiology, (March 2011). Supplementation with bovine colostrum, 20 grams per day (g/d), in combination with exercise training for 8 wk may increase bone- free lean body mass in active men and women. Low IGF-1 levels may be associated with dementia in the very elderly, although causation has not been established. Malnutrition can cause low levels of IGF-1, as can obesity. Supplementation with colostrum, which is rich in IGF-1, can be a useful part of a weight reduction program. Although IGF-1 is not absorbed intact by the body, some studies suggest it stimulates the production of IGF-1 when taken as a supplement whereas others do not Colostrum also has antioxidant components, such as lactoferrin and hemopexin, which binds free heme in the body. The Isle of Man had a local delicacy called \\"Groosniuys\\", a pudding made with colostrum. In Finland, a baked cheese called Leip√§juusto is traditionally made with either cow colostrum or reindeer milk. A sweet cheese-like delicacy called 'Junnu' is made with colostrum in the south Indian states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. It is made with both cow and buffalo milk; in both cases it is the milk produced on the second day after giving birth which is considered best for making this pudding-like delicacy. Colostrum is in very high demand in these states, resulting in product adulteration. ===Hyperimmune Colostrum=== Hyperimmune colostrum is natural bovine colostrum collected from a population of cows immunized repeatedly with a specific pathogen. The colostrum is collected within 24 hours of the cow giving birth. Antibodies towards the specific pathogens or antigens that were used in the immunization are present in higher levels than in the population before treatment. Although some papers have been published stating that specific human pathogens were just as high as in hyperimmune colostrum, and natural colostrum nearly always had higher antibody titers than did the hyperimmune version. Clinical trials have shown that if the immunization is by surface antigens of the bacteria, the Bovine Colostrum Powder TGA guidance BCP can be used to make tablets capable of binding to the bacteria so that they are excreted in stools. This prevents the successful colonization of the gut, which would otherwise lead to bacteria releasing enterotoxigenic materials. === Proline-rich Polypeptides === These small immune signaling peptides (PRPs) were independently discovered in colostrum and other sources, such as blood plasma, in the United States, Czechoslovakia and Poland. Hence they appear under various names in the literature, including Colostrinin, CLN, transfer factor and PRP. They function as signal transducing molecules that have the unique effect of modulating the immune system, turning it up when the body comes under attack from pathogens or other disease agents, and damping it when the danger is eliminated or neutralized. At first thought to actually transfer immunity from one immune system to another, it now appears that PRPs simply stimulate cell-mediated immunity. == References == ==External links== * Maryland Cooperative Extension Category:Animal products Category:Biotechnology Category:Breastfeeding Category:Breast milk Category:Milk Category:Dietary supplements ","title":"Colostrum"},{"id":"525726","text":"Don Cossacks () or Donians (, dontsy), are Cossacks who settled along the middle and lower Don. Historically, they have been located within what was the Don Cossack Host (, Donskoye Kazache Voisko), which was either an independent or an autonomous democratic republic in the present-day Southern Russia and the Donbass region of Ukraine, from the end of the 16th century until 1918. As of 1992, by the presidential decree of the Russian Federation, Cossacks can be enrolled on a special register. A number of Cossack communities have been reconstituted to further the Cossack cultural traditions, including those of the Don Cossack Host. Don Cossacks have had a rich military tradition, playing an important part in the historical development of the Russian Empire and participating in most of its major wars. == Etymology and origins == The name Cossack (–∫–∞–∑–∞–∫, –∫–æ–∑–∞–∫) was widely used to describe \\"free people\\" as opposed to others with different standing in a feudal society (i.e., peasants, nobles, clergy, etc.). The word 'cossack' was also applied to migrants, free-booters and bandits. The exact origins of Cossacks are unknown. In the modern view, Don Cossacks are descendants of Slavic people, and connected with Russian lands like Povolzhye, Dnieper, Novgorod Republic, and Principality of Ryazan. Goths-AlansSee works of Evgueni Goloubinski and Vasily Vasilievsky about Relations of Gothoalans (Goths-Tetraxits) and Russian colonists in region of North-East part of Black Sea and Sea of Azov could also have played a role in Don cossacks culture, which originated in the Western part of North Caucasus. == History Early history=== More than two thousand years ago the Scythians lived on the banks of the river Don. Many Scythian tombs have been found in this area. Subsequently, the area was inhabited by the Khazars and the Polovtsians. The steppes of the Don River were called \\"The Wild Field\\" (–î–∏–∫–æ–µ –ü–æ–ª–µ). The area was under the general control of the Golden Horde, and numerous Tatar armed groups roamed there, attacking Russian and foreign merchants. The first Christians to settle on the territories around the Don were the Jassi and Kosogi tribes. After the fall of the Golden Horde in 1480, more Russian colonists started to expand onto this land from the Novgorod Republic after the Battle of Shelon and from neighboring Principality of Ryazan. Until the end of the 16th century, the Don Cossacks inhabited independent free territories.Facts about Cossack: habitation of Don River basin, as discussed in Don River (river, Russia): History and economy: - Britannica Online Encyclopedia ===15th‚Äì17th centuries=== Cossacks of Ryazan are mentioned in 1444 as defenders of Pereslavl-Zalessky against the units of Golden Horde and in a letter of Ivan III of Russia from 1502. After the Golden Horde fell in 1480, the area around the Don River was divided between the Crimean west side and the Nogai east side. On their border since the 14th century the vast steppe of the Don region was populated by those people who were not satisfied with the existing social order, by those who did not recognize the power of the land-owners, by runaway serfs, by those who longed for freedom. In the course of time they turned into a united community and were called \\"the Cossacks\\". At first the main occupation of these small armed detachments was hunting and fishing‚Äîas well as the constant struggle against the Turks and the Tatars who attacked them. Only later they began to settle and work on the land. 16th century The first records relating to the Cossack villages: the \\"stanitsa\\", date back to 1549. In the year 1552 Don Cossacks under the command of Ataman Susar Fedorov joined the Army of Ivan the Terrible during the Siege of Kazan in 1552. On 2 June 1556 the Cossack regiment of Ataman Lyapun Filimonov, together with the Army of Moscovits comprising strelets, conquered and annexed the Astrakhan Khanate. During the reign of Ivan the Terrible (Ivan IV), the ataman Yermak Timofeyevich went on an expedition to conquer Siberia. After defeating Khan Kuchum in the fall of 1582 and occupying Isker: the capital of the Siberian Khanate, Yermak sent a force of cossacks down the Irtysh in the winter of 1583. The detachment led by Bogdan Bryazga (according to other sources, the Cossack chieftain Nikita Pan); passed through the lands of the Konda-Pelym Voguls and reached the walls of the town of Samarovo. Taken by surprise by the cossack attack, the Ostyaks surrendered. In fall 1585, shortly after Yermak's death, Cossacks led by voevoda (army commander) Ivan Mansurov founded the first Russian fortified town in Siberia, Obskoy, at the mouth of the Irtysh river on the right bank of the Ob river. The Mansi and Khanty lands thus became part of the Russian state, finally secured by the founding of the cities of Pelym and Berezov in 1592 and Surgut in 1594. As a result of Yermak's expedition, Russia was able to annex Siberia. 17th century During the Polish‚ÄìMuscovite War (1605‚Äì18), the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian noble Aleksander J√≥zef Lisowski founded a cavalry mercenary group (named Lisowczycy after his death) from various outlaws, partly Don Cossacks. This group served under the Polish Crown; after the war with Muscovites Lisowczycy took part in the Moldavian Magnate Wars (Battle of Humenn√© in 23 November 1619) at Upper Hungary, (now eastern Slovakia), later they plundered Silesia and Moravia as allies of Habsburg armies in the Bohemian Revolt ‚Äì first phase of Thirty Years' War. This phase culminated in the Battle of White Mountain in 8 November 1620 (near Prague, the capital of the Crown of Bohemia, now the Czech Republic), where the Lisowczycy were sent by Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly against Hungarian cavalry. They were victorious, capturing twenty standards. After the battle, they terrorised village people around Prague and other cities,, pp. 8‚Äì9 so they were expeditiously paid and released from service in 7 May 1621. Some returned to Poland, others served under Habsburg Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria. Don cossacks in Paris in 1814 Under Peter the Great and subsequent rulers, the Don Cossacks participated in numerous military campaigns, which resulted in the expansion of the Russian Empire from the Black Sea to the Baltic Sea. For years, the Cossacks waged war against the Ottomans and the Crimean Khanate. In 1637 the Don Cossacks, joined by the Zaporozhian Cossacks, captured the strategic Ottoman fortress of Azov, which guarded the Don.Brian L. Davies, Warfare, State and Society on the Black Sea Steppe, 2007, page 89-90 The defense of the Azov Fortress in 1641 was one of the key actions in Don Cossack history. After total taking of the Free Territories of Don Cossacks under the Moscovits control, Don Cossack history is totally intertwined with the history of the rest of Russia. In exchange for protection of the Southern borders of medieval Russia, the Don Cossacks were given the privilege of not paying taxes and the tsar's authority in Cossack lands was not as absolute as in other parts of Russia. During this period, three of Russia's most notorious rebels, Stenka Razin, Kondraty Bulavin and Emelian Pugachev, were Don Cossacks. ===18th‚Äì19th centuries=== 1915 drawing from The War Illustrated showing a charging Don Cossack. The figure is portrayed in peacetime dress uniform After 1786, the territory of the Don Cossacks was officially called Don Voisko Lands, and was renamed Don Voisko Province (Oblast‚Äô Voyska Donskogo) in 1870 (presently part of the Rostov, Volgograd, and Voronezh regions of the Russian Federation as well as part of the Luhansk region of Ukraine). In 1805 the Don Cossack capital was shifted from Cherkassk to Novocherkassk (New Cherkassk).Paul Heineman, \\"In Defense of an Anachronism: the Cossack Question on the Don, 1861-1914.\\" PhD Dissertation, Georgetown University, 2000. Don Cossacks are credited with playing a significant part in repelling Napoleon's Invasion of Russia. Under the command of Count Matvey Ivanovich Platov, the Don Cossacks fought in a number of battles against the Grande Arm√©e. In the Battle of Borodino, Don Cossacks made raids to the rear of the French Army. Platov commanded all the Cossack troops and successfully covered the retreat of the Russian Army to Moscow. The Don Cossacks distinguished themselves in subsequent campaigns, and took part in the capture of Paris. Napoleon is credited with declaring, \\"Cossacks are the finest light troops among all that exist. If I had them in my army, I would go through all the world with them.\\" In the general census of 1884, the male population of the Don Cossacks was reported to number 425,000. The Don Cossacks were the largest of the ten cossack hosts then in existence, providing over a third of total cossack manpower available for military service. ===20th century=== World War I On the eve of World War I, the Don Cossack Host comprised 17 regular regiments plus 6 detached sotnias (squadrons). In addition two regiments of the Imperial Guard were recruited from the Don territory. By 1916 the Don Host had expanded to 58 line regiments and 100 detached sotnias. The central location of the Don territories meant that these units were employed extensively on both the German and Austro-Hungarian fronts, though less so against the Ottoman Turks to the south. The continued value of the Don and other Cossacks as mounted troops was illustrated by the decision taken in 1916 to dismount about a third of the regular Russian cavalry, but to retain the cossack regiments in their traditional role. February 1917 Revolution At the outbreak of the February 1917 Revolution, three regiments of Don Cossacks (the 1st, 4th and 14th) formed part of the garrison of St. Petersburg. Consisting partly of new recruits from the poorer regions of the Host territory, these units were influenced by the general disillusionment with the Tsar's government. Accordingly, they did not act effectively when ordered to disperse the growing demonstrations in the city. Reports that the historically loyal Don Cossacks could no longer be relied on were a significant factor in the sudden collapse of the Tsarist regime.Albert Seaton, page 27 \\"The Cossacks\\", SBN 85045 116 7 Bolshevik persecution The Don Cossack Host was disbanded on Russian soil in 1918, after the Russian Revolution, but the Don Cossacks in the White Army and those who emigrated abroad, continued to preserve the traditions, musical and otherwise, of their host. Many found employment as trick riders in various circuses throughout Europe and the United States. Admiral Aleksandr Vasiliyevich Kolchak, one of the leaders of the White movement during the Russian Civil War, was of Don Cossack descent. Following the defeat of the White Army in the Russian Civil War, a policy of decossackization (\\"Raskazachivaniye\\") took place on the surviving Cossacks and their homelands, since they were viewed as a threat to the new Soviet regime. Percentage of depopulation during the Soviet famine of 1932-33. Formerly Don Cossack lands are on right. The Cossack homelands were often very fertile, and during the collectivisation campaign many Cossacks shared the fate of the kulaks. According to historian Michael Kort, \\"During 1919 and 1920, out of a population of approximately 1.5 million Don Cossacks, the Bolshevik regime killed or deported an estimated 300,000 to 500,000\\".Kort, Michael (2001).

A monument to Don Cossacks in Lugansk. In Russian: \\"To the sons of glory and freedom\\" Don Cossacks in World War II On 20 April 1936 the previous ban on Cossacks serving in the Red Army was lifted. Later the same year two existing Red Army cavalry divisions were re-designated as Don Cossacks. By 1939 a number of these regiments had been issued with traditional Cossack uniforms in ceremonial and field service versions. The dress of the Don Cossack units included the broad red stripes on dark-blue breeches, which had been their distinguishing feature prior to the Revolution. The Don Cossack Cavalry Corps saw extensive active service until 1943, after which its role diminished (as did that of the other remaining horse-mounted units in the Red Army).Albert Seaton, pages 31-32 The Cossacks, SBN 85045 116 7 However Don Cossack cavalry was still in existence in 1945 and participated in the Victory Parade in Moscow. During World War II, the Don Cossacks mustered the largest single concentration of Cossacks within the German Army, the XVth SS Cossack Cavalry Corps. A great part of the Cossacks were former Russian citizens who elected to fight not so much for Germany as against the Soviet Union. The XVth SS Cossack Cavalry Corps included the 1st Cossack Division and the 2nd Cossack Division. ===21st century=== Modern Don Cossacks Today the Russian state is very different. Between 1917 and 1941, more than half of the Don Cossacks population were killed or deported. The heirs of those deported during the Soviet Terror cannot return to their homeland. This is because the law of Restitution does not recognize them as victims of communism. The pro- governmental Host divided in two different organisations. The Don Cossacks were revived in the early 1990s and were officially recognised by the Russian Federation Government in 1997, its Ataman holding the rank, insignia and uniform of a full Marshal. In 1992 they joined the separatists forces during the Transnistria War.Hughes, James and Sasse, Gwendolyn: Ethnicity and territory in the former Soviet Union: regions in conflict. Taylor & Francis, 2002, page 107. There still exist several \\"Organisations of Anti-communist Cossacks Outside Russia.\\" The most known is the Almighty Don Host Outside Russia, formerly under chief Major general and last chevalier of the Order of St. George, Ataman Nikolai Vasilievich Fedorov (1901‚Äî2003), and since February 2006 under J. L. Miheev. Since 2014, an unknown number of Don Cossacks have participated in the war in Eastern Ukraine as independent volunteers. Reportedly several military formations were formed though most of these groups were subsequently disbanded and integrated into the armed forces of the DPR and LPR.\\"Russians Find Few Barriers to Joining Ukraine Battle\\" The New York Times 9 June 2014. - \\"... among eastern Ukrainian militants, Cossack symbols like sheepskin hats, or the Don Cossack symbol of a stag struck by an arrow ‚Äî meaning it is better to die free than to live like a slave ‚Äî are commonplace.\\"\\"Ukraine: Common history pulls in aid from west Russia\\". BBC News. 23 June 2014. ==National symbols of Don CossacksFlag of Don Cossacks=== Flag of Don Cossacks The Don Cossacks flag 3:4 was inaugurated during the Don Cossacks assembly in Novocherkassk, Don Republic, on 4 May 1918 under chiefing of Ataman Pyotr Krasnov. The flag has three colours: blue, yellow, and red. The flag is similar to that of the Ukrainian State, also established in 1918, which the Don Republic bordered to its west. ===Coat of arms=== The Don Cossacks Coat of Arms was known from the 17th century. It was adopted as a symbol of the Don Republic on 15 September 1918. Coat of Arms of Don Cossacks ===Uniform=== Until 1914 the distinguishing colour of the Don Cossack Host was red: worn on the cap bands and wide trouser stripes of a dark blue uniform of the loose-fitting cut common to the Steppe Cossacks. Tall lambskin hats were worn on occasion, with red cloth tops edged in white lace. Silver metal scrolls were worn on the headdress to denote the distinguished conduct on individual regiments. Officers had silver braiding on their collars and epaulettes plus silver/black girdles. Shoulder-straps of other ranks were the same dark blue as the caftan (coat). A whip was used instead of spurs.page 591 of volume 27, The Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Eleventh Edition Prior to 1908, individual cossacks from all Hosts were required to provide their own uniforms (together with horses and harness). However the size and relative affluence of the Don Cossack Host permitted the setting up of communally owned clothing factories. A khaki field tunic was adopted in 1908, replacing the dark blue coats or white (summer) blouses previously worn for ordinary duties. However the blue riding breeches with broad red stripes long characteristic of the Don Host, continued to be worn even on active service during both World Wars. The Don Cossack Battery of the Imperial Guard wore a \\"Tsar's green\\" (a dark shade common to the army) uniform, with the black and red distinctions of the artillery as a branch. ===Anthem of Don Cossacks=== –í—Å–∫–æ–ª—ã—Ö–Ω—É–ª—Å—è, –≤–∑–≤–æ–ª–Ω–æ–≤–∞–ª—Å—è –ø—Ä–∞–≤–æ—Å–ª–∞–≤–Ω—ã–π –¢–∏—Ö–∏–π –î–æ–Ω written by Fedor Anisimov in 1853.http://a-pesni.org/grvojna/bel/vskol1918.php Anthem of Don Cossacks in Russian Civil War. ==Religion== Most Don Cossacks are Russian Orthodox, who consider themselves guardians of the faith.

An illustration from Fyodor Solntsev, 1869 The Cossacks had a democratic society where the most important decisions were made during a Common Assembly (–ö–∞–∑–∞—á–∏–π –ö—Ä—É–≥). The assembly elected temporary authorities ‚Äî atamans. Don Cossacks were skilled horsemen and experienced warriors, due to their long conflict with the Crimean Khanate and the Ottoman Empire. They sold their military services to different powers in Eastern Europe. Together with the Polish King, they raided Moscow during the Time of Troubles (–°–º—É—Ç–Ω–æ–µ –í—Ä–µ–º—è) and, under Russian authority, carried out raids and expeditions against Ottoman Turkey and Qajar Persia. Isolated between Russian and Muslim territory, the Don Cossacks developed a distinct culture and language which fused Ukrainian, Russian, Kalmyk, and Tatar elements.Encyclopedia of the Stateless Nations: D-K, By James Minahan. page 540 The Don Cossacks have a tradition of choral singing and many of their songs, such as Chyorny Voron (Black Raven) and Lyubo, Bratsi, Lyubo (It's good, brothers, good) became popular throughout the rest of Russia. Many of the songs are about death in war. Up to the 18th century marriages and divorces were held in the Common Assembly (–ö–∞–∑–∞—á–∏–π –ö—Ä—É–≥). If a Cossack wanted to marry a woman he was expected to bring her to the Common Assembly for presentation. If the Common Assembly gave approval, the marriage followed. The same procedure took place if there was a divorce. Peter I banned these practices in the Common Assembly, requiring Cossacks to marry only in church. A Cossack marriage is a complex ritual, accompanied by songs, dances and performances. A bridegroom arrives on horseback and takes his bride to the church, followed by a marriage train. After the wedding all present would adjourn to the bridegroom's house. There, the parents would bless the couple, break a loaf of bread above their heads, and sprinkle them with wheat, nuts, sweets and hops. The bride's hair would then be unbraided according to traditional rites. When a son was born to a Cossack family, his relatives presented him with an arrow, a bow, a cartridge, a bullet and a gun. All of these items were hung on the wall, over the boy's bed. At the age of three, the boy began to ride a horse. At the age of 7 to 8 he was allowed to ride in the street, to go fishing and hunt with adults. Horse racing was a popular pastime with Don Cossacks. Riders competed to hit a target, firing weapons from horseback. The most dexterous were able to do this standing on the horses back. It was traditional practice for Cossack families to provide a young Cossack with two horses, a uniform and weapons. Cossack leave-taking was always festive. All departing Cossacks would gather in the church, then hang a small bag around their necks containing a pinch of their native soil before setting off singing. Having left their stanitsa, they drank a cup of vodka and said good-bye to their native land. General of Don Cossack in the early 1800s ===Don Cossack Choir Serge Jaroff=== The Don Cossack Choir Serge Jaroff was a group of former officers of the Russian Imperial Army who were discovered singing in √áilingir (near Constantinople), where they had fled after the defeat of their army in the Crimea. They made their formal concert debut in Vienna in 1923, led by their founder, conductor and composer, Serge Jaroff. The choir became popular in America, Japan and Europe, touring the world in the 1930s, 40s and 50s, till today. The men, dressed as Cossacks, sang a cappella in a repertory of Russian sacred and secular music, army, folk and art songs. Cossack dancing was eventually added to their programme. ===In popular culture=== Mikhail Sholokhov's monumental work, \\"And Quiet Flows the Don\\", deals sympathetically with the Don Cossacks and depicts the destruction of their way of life as a result of World War I and the Russian Civil War. == See also == * Azov Sea Region Museum of Cossacks === Notable Don Cossacks === * Don Cossacks noble families * Kondraty Bulavin * Alexei Kaledin * Pyotr Krasnov * Matvei Platov * Emilian Pugachev * Stepan RazinStepan Razin, Don Cossack leader who led a major uprising * Yermak Timofeyevich * Ivan Turchaninov ‚Äî Union army brigadier general in the American Civil War. * Aleksandr Khanzhonkov === Don Cossacks government and policy === * Don Republic * Don Army * Cossacks in Turkey * List of Imperial Russian Army Don Cossack regiments === Don Cossack books === * \\"And Quiet Flows the Don\\" === Genocide and Don Cossacks === * Anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire * Kiev pogroms of 1919 \\"Carried by Don Cossacks\\". * Decossackization * Repatriation of Cossacks after World War II ‚Äî \\"betrayal of the Cossacks\\". ** \\"Victims of Yalta\\" ‚Äî 1977 book. * Ethnic Cleansing of Circassians * Genocides in history * Human rights in the Soviet Union * Population transfer in the Soviet Union ==Footnotes== ==Further reading== * Peter Holquist, \\"'Conduct Merciless Mass Terror': Decossackization on the Don, 1919,\\" Cahiers du Monde russe, vol. 38, no. 1/2(Jan.-June 1997), pp. 127‚Äì162.

The Slavic name of Seversky Donets derived from the fact that the river originates from the land of Severians. As the Italian-Polish chronicler Alexander Guagnini (1538‚Äì1614) wrote: \\"There is also another, small Tanais, which originates in the Seversky Principality (for this reason it is called Donets Seversky) and flows into the large Tanais above Azov\\".

The first archaeological evidence of settlers relates to Cheulean and Acheulean periods of Lower Paleolithic through stone tools (axes) found on the river banks near Izium city of Kharkiv Oblast and in Luhansk Oblast.Boriskovsky PI Paleolithic Ukraine, Materials and Research on the Archaeology of the USSR (MIA), v. 40, Moscow, Leningrad, 1953 Over the ages, the river banks were populated by tribals of various cultures, including Mousterian, Yamna, Catacomb, Scythian, Alan, Khazar and later Slavic cultures. Many of the related tribals had nomadic lifestyle characteristic of Kipchak people, Golden Horde and later of Cossacks. The river flows through the historic lands of Sloboda Ukraine as well as the lands of Don River Host. The many Cossacks became later assimilated into the strengthening Russian Empire, which had rebuilt and reinforced the fortress of Belgorod and cities of Kyiv, Izium, Luhansk, Chuhuiv and others in order keep defensive lines against the raids of nomads from the south-east. Later, the protective role of the river basin gave way to economic needs. In the 18th‚Äì19th centuries, the river was extensively used for watermills, which numbered by hundreds by the end of the 18th century, and the mill dams interrupted navigation on the river.\\"–û–ø–∏—Å–∞–Ω–∏—è –•–∞—Ä—å–∫–æ–≤—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –Ω–∞–º–µ—Å—Ç–Ω–∏—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –∫–æ–Ω—Ü–∞ XVIII –≤–µ–∫–∞\\".

Seversky Donets ‚Äì Donbas, Acad. \\"Donbas\\", Donetsk, 1982 Already by the 1930s, Kharkiv, Donetsk and Luhansk were lacking water forcing the authorities to gradually create a network of canals and reservoirs. In 1936, the Kochetok Reservoir was created and coupled to the water system of Kharkiv. By the 1950s, this measure proved insufficient, and in the 1960s, Pechenga Reservoir was constructed in place of the Kochetok Reservoir. It has with the capacity of 400 million m3 and provides about 75% of water consumed by Kharkiv. To supply water to southern Donbas and Donetsk, the 130-km long Donets-Donbass channel was built around 1958 starting near Raigorodok city, and in compensation, the Dnieper-Donbass channel was created to supply water from Dnieper River to the upstream of the Donets via the Bereka River.Kimstach, p. 381 As a result of the industrial activity, the wild nature of Donets Basin transformed into an industrial settlement.Gorelova, LN, Dogadina T., Krivitsky IA Enchanted Valley.

Donets River in 1903 and 1904 and the project of the waterway from Kharkiv and Belgorod to the confluence of river Donets, St. Petersburg, 1910 were interrupted by World War I, Russian Civil War and lack of funds. The design of the dams and their old age slowed the navigation of the river, which is currently rather limited. ==Environment== Being one of the largest rivers in Ukraine, the Donets is very intensively used in farming and industry. Ukraine alone uses more than of river waters per year, half of which is returned as polluted discharges; this consumption effectively reduces river runoff by . Donets suffered greatly even back in the 18th century, when old oaks were cut down along its banks.Morozov YI –ì–∏–¥—Ä–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏—á–µ–∫—ñ–π –æ—á–µ—Ä–∫—ä –°—£–≤–µ—Ä–Ω–∞–≥–æ –î–æ–Ω—Ü–∞, University of Harkov, 1874 The industrial development of the 19th century reduced the groundwater levels of the basin. This resulted in shallowing of the river and slowed navigation. Until the mid-19th century, the river was rich in fish which population rapidly declined since then. The water quality is graded as level IV (polluted) to V (dirty). The main pollutants are fertilizers, petroleum, phenols, zinc, chromium and copper.Kimstach, pp. 192, 214, 258, 388‚Äì394 In Kharkiv Oblast, water is contaminated by industrial and communal wastes of Belgorod, Izyum and Shebekino cities, but the water is partially purified through the Pechenga Reservoir. The density of plants and thus the contamination increase downstream in Donetsk and Luhansk areas, especially around Lysychansk and Sievierodonetsk, about 400 km from the mouth. Some tributaries of the Donets, such as Kozenyi Butt, Bakhmut and Lugan are so polluted that consuming fish caught there is dangerous. The purest segment of Donets is between the source and Belgorod, and between the Pecheneg Reservoir and Chuhuiv. Average water salinity is 650‚Äì750 mg/L, and it increases in winter to 1000 mg/L mostly due to industrial wastewater.Agroclimaticale directory of Kharkiv area, Gidrometeoizdat, Leningrad, 1957 Carp ==Flora and faunaFish === The Donets hosts 44 species of fish, predominantly small fishes such as European perch, rutilus and common rudd. Medium and large species include bream, perch, catfish and pike and are becoming increasingly rare. Near Pechenga Reservoir a large hatchery of carp has successfully operated since 1967.Lisiecki A. Fauna of the Kharkiv Oblast Proceedings of the Geographical Society of Kharkiv in Ukraine. Volume VIII. Kharkiv Oblast. Nature and economy, Kharkiv State University, Kharkiv, 1971 ===Amphibians and reptiles=== Grass snake On the banks of the river, in the floodplain wetlands, there are abundant water frogs, toads (especially green toad), smooth and great crested newts and less common grass snake, dice snake and European pond terrapin. ===Mammals=== Human activities, mainly cultivation of the steppes, resulted in the disappearance of animals formerly common in the basin, such as tarpan, steppe antelope, saiga antelope, marmots and others. Back in the 1960s‚Äì1970s, especially near Oskol River, it was not unusual to meet bobak marmot, Eurasian deer, wild boar and Russian desman. Current mammals of the basin include European beaver, Dipodidae, suslik, mice, European otter, European mink, weasel and bats. { Class = \\"\\" style = \\"text-align: center\\" Width = \\"25%\\"220px Width = \\"25%\\"215px Width = \\"25%\\"160px Width = \\"25%\\"200px - Russian desman Marmot European otter Least weasel } ===Birds=== The number of bird species of the river basin reduced sharply over the past 100‚Äì150 years. The disappeared species include steppe eagle, tirkusha, sociable lapwing, bustard, black and winged lark. Less common are geese, swans, golden eagle, white-tailed eagle, peregrine falcon, honey buzzard and osprey. The reduction is mainly caused by the destruction of forests, especially old groves along the river banks. The creation of artificial forest belts (windbreaks) in the basin in the 1960s brought insectivorous birds new to this area, such as Streptopelia, European magpie and shrikes. From the traditional bird types, still common are several species of ducks, crows, Charadriiformes, Podiceps, great reed warbler and much less common are herons and storks. Only 12 individuals of demoiselle cranes remain in the area, near Svyatogorsk city. During the migratory season, the region is visited by greylag and black geese. { Class = \\"\\" style = \\"text- align: center\\" + Width = \\"25%\\"190px Width = \\"25%\\"175px Width = \\"25%\\"215px Width = \\"25%\\"210px - Demoiselle crane Great reed warbler Skylark White-tailed eagle } Downy birch ===Flora=== Banks of the river used to contain groves of trees, which were cut during the 18th‚Äì19th centuries. Some of the trees were used for shipbuilding during the Russian- Turkish wars in the time of Peter I. By the 20th century, most meadows along the river banks were converted into farmers' fields. Only a small part of the old groves remains, mainly in the Kharkiv Oblast. North of Izium, there are still broadleaf forests, and pine forests are found near Chuhuiv. Many species of wild plants survive near floodplain wetlands. These include willow, downy birch, alder and krushinnik. Along the river banks, there are cane, swamp horsetail, carex, kizlyak, swamp sabelnik and other types of grass. ==Tourism== Downstream of Zmiyev. The Donets is regarded as one of the most scenic rivers of East European Plain and contains many hiking and biking routes along its banks. Canoe rafting is rather popular, especially between Zmiyev and Svyatogorsk. Rafting is of the first (lowest) degree of difficulty. The busiest tourism months are from May to September.Gorbunova NN Boat Tours in Ukraine, Physical Education and Sports, Moscow, 1969 The most picturesque part is probably near the town of Izium, which hosts a National Park of Holy Mountains. Down to Lysychansk, the water is clean for swimming, and there are many sandy beaches on the shores. Near Pechenga Reservoir, there are several health resorts. ==Gallery== { Class = \\"\\" style = \\"text-align: center\\" + Width = \\"25%\\"195px Width = \\"25%\\"195px Width = \\"25%\\"195px Width = \\"25%\\"195px Seversky Donets River near the village of Yaremovka - Spring flood Spring Summer Winter } ==References== ==Bibliography== * ==External links== * Donets River at the Encyclopedia of Ukraine * Site Seversk-Donets Basin Water Resources * –°–µ–≤–µ—Ä—Å–∫–∏–π –î–æ–Ω–µ—Ü, Great Soviet Encyclopedia * –°–µ–≤–µ—Ä—Å–∫–∏–π –î–æ–Ω–µ—Ü, Dictionary of modern geographical names ===Satellite pictures from the source to the mouth=== * Source area in Belgorod Oblast.

Known for his intensity, defensive ability, and versatility, Garnett is considered one of the greatest power forwards of all time. He is one of four NBA players to win both the Most Valuable Player and the Defensive Player of the Year awards. In high school, Garnett was a 1995 McDonald's All-American at Farragut Career Academy and won a national player of the year award. He entered the 1995 NBA draft, where he was selected with the fifth overall pick by the Minnesota Timberwolves and became the first NBA player drafted directly out of high school in 20 years. Garnett made an immediate impact with the Minnesota Timberwolves, leading them to eight consecutive playoff appearances. In 2004, he led the Timberwolves to the Western Conference Finals and won the NBA MVP Award. Garnett has been named to 15 All-Star Games, winning the All-Star MVP award in 2003, and is currently tied for fourth-most All-Star selections with 15. He was named the NBA Defensive Player of the Year in 2007‚Äì08, and has been selected nine times for All-NBA Teams and 12 times for All-Defensive Teams. Garnett also holds several Timberwolves franchise records. He is known as \\"the Big Ticket\\" for his emphatic dunking and athleticism. In 2007, after 12 seasons with the Timberwolves, Garnett joined the Boston Celtics in a blockbuster trade. In his first year with the Celtics, he helped lead them to the NBA championship, while also finishing in third place for the MVP award. In 2013, Garnett was included in a second headline trade that sent him to the Brooklyn Nets with longtime Celtic Paul Pierce. In 2015, Garnett was traded back to Minnesota. He announced his retirement from professional basketball in September 2016. Garnett made his feature film debut, playing a fictionalized version of himself, in the 2019 film Uncut Gems. ==Early life and high school career== Garnett was born on May 19, 1976 in Greenville, South Carolina to Shirley Garnett. He was the second of his mother's three children. Garnett's mother never married his father, O'Lewis McCullough, with their relationship ending shortly after his birth. Garnett grew up with his mother and stepfather, Ernest Irby, with whom he did not get along, and two sisters. Garnett fell in love with the sport of basketball while attending Hillcrest Middle School, although he did not play organized basketball until high school. In his first three years of high school, Garnett attended Mauldin High School in Mauldin, South Carolina and played on the school's basketball team. However, during the summer before his senior year of high school, Garnett was in the general vicinity of a fight between black and white students. Although not directly involved, Garnett was one of three students arrested for second-degree lynching, a charge that was expunged through a pre-trial intervention. Due to the racially charged incident and fearful of being a target, Garnett decided to leave Mauldin High and transferred to Farragut Career Academy in Chicago's West Side, for his senior year of high school. Living with his sister in Chicago, Garnett led Farragut to a 28‚Äì2 record and was named National High School Player of the Year by USA Today. He was also named Mr. Basketball for the state of Illinois after averaging 25.2 points, 17.9 rebounds, 6.7 assists and 6.5 blocks while shooting 66.8% from the field. In four years of high school, Garnett posted an impressive 2,553 points, 1,809 rebounds and 737 blocked shots. In high school, Garnett played alongside Ronnie Fields, who also became a professional basketball player. Garnett was named the Most Outstanding Player at the McDonald's All-American Game after registering 18 points, 11 rebounds, 4 assists and 3 blocked shots, and then declared himself eligible for the 1995 NBA draft. To mark the 35th anniversary of the McDonald's All-American High School Boys Basketball Game, Garnett was honored as one of 35 Greatest McDonald's All-Americans. Garnett's decision not to play college basketball was influenced in part by his failure to score well enough on the ACT to meet NCAA requirements for freshman eligibility. Garnett told Student Sports Magazine in 1995 that if he had attended college he would have chosen to play college basketball for the University of Maryland. A Chicago area high school coach referred Garnett with Eric Fleisher, then agent for 18 NBA players and son of first National Basketball Players Association head Larry Fleisher, to discuss the possibility of going to the NBA straight out of high school. Two weeks later at the Lakeshore Athletic Club, Fleisher ran a small tryout where Garnett dominated against older, more-experienced competition. Fleisher then set Detroit Pistons assistant John Hammond to run the drills at another workout at the University of Illinois-Chicago to gauge NBA interest. Representatives from the 13 teams with lottery picks, with Kevin McHale, Elgin Baylor, Flip Saunders, and Kevin Loughery among them, were in the workout that was scheduled around the same time as a pre-draft tryout camp. The workout included Garnett touching the box painted on the backboard above the rim multiple times, and McHale giving Garnett tips on shooting jump shots. An hour before going to the 1995 NBA Draft in the Toronto SkyDome, his coach at Farragut, William (Wolf) Nelson, gave encouragement and told Garnett that he passed the last SAT test he took with a score of 970. ==Professional careerMinnesota Timberwolves (1995‚Äì2007)=== Early years (1995‚Äì1997) Garnett was drafted with the fifth overall pick in the 1995 NBA draft by the Minnesota Timberwolves, and became the first player to be drafted directly out of high school since 1975.\\"From preps to the pros: High school senior Garnett enters NBA draft\\". Star News Services. May 12, 2005. Retrieved on February 22, 2009. Since joining the NBA for the 1989‚Äì90 season, the Timberwolves had not won more than 29 games in any season. In Garnett's rookie season, the Timberwolves were in the midst of a transition phase; they replaced Bill Blair with Flip Saunders as head coach early in the season, and made several trades. Garnett initially came off the bench in his rookie year, but moved into the starting lineup soon after Saunders became head coach and with the urging of Sam Mitchell. In the final 42 games of the year, averaged 14 points, 8.4 rebounds and 2.26 blocks as a starter. In his rookie year, Garnett and fellow newcomer Tom Gugliotta carried the scoring load. Garnett did not immediately leap to stardom as later prep-to-pro prospects such as Amar'e Stoudemire, LeBron James and Dwight Howard would, but he did have a very respectable rookie year. He was voted to the All-Rookie Second Team on averages of 10.4 points, 6.3 rebounds and 1.8 assists per game. Despite having some promising players, the Timberwolves suffered through their seventh consecutive sub-30 win season and failed to make the playoffs. At the time, Garnett was the youngest NBA player in history at 19 years and 11 months of age. Before the 1996‚Äì97 season, the Timberwolves made a draft-day trade for point guard Stephon Marbury of the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets. During the season, Garnett posted improved averages of 17.0 points, 8.0 rebounds, 3.1 assists, 2.1 blocks and 1.7 steals. He also had two games where he registered eight blocks. With a 40‚Äì42 record, the Timberwolves made their first playoff appearance in franchise history, Garnett and Gugliotta made their first All- Star appearances, and Marbury established himself as a valuable young lead guard. However, the Houston Rockets, led by Hakeem Olajuwon, Clyde Drexler, and Charles Barkley, proved to be too much as the Timberwolves were swept 3‚Äì0 in the first round of the 1997 NBA Playoffs. Franchise player (1997‚Äì2001) In August 1997, Garnett and Fleisher turned down the Timberwolves' offer of a contract worth $102 million over six years. They thought there would be more offered to them on the basis of the signings of $105 million over seven years for Alonzo Mourning of the Miami Heat and $100.8 million over seven years for Juwan Howard with the Washington Bullets. To get out of the spotlight while negotiations were ongoing, Garnett stayed in Fleisher's Westchester County home, north of New York City. One hour before the deadline on 1 October 1997, the Timberwolves and Garnett agreed on a six- year contract extension that was worth an unparalleled $126 million. The contract was considered a risky move and many analysts speculated that the deal would make it impossible for the Wolves to sign new players or even keep their own. The enormous size of Garnett's contract was considered, by numerous sports writers, a major cause of labor tensions between players and owners that led to a lockout which shortened the 1998‚Äì99 NBA season. Despite the furor over his new contract, Garnett continued to improve, averaging 18.5 points, 9.6 rebounds, 4.2 assists, 1.8 blocks, and 1.7 steals per game. Again, he was an All-Star, and the Timberwolves finished with their first winning record in franchise history (45‚Äì37 for the season). For the second consecutive year, the young Timberwolves bowed out of the playoffs in the first round, this time losing 3‚Äì2 to the Seattle SuperSonics and superstar point guard Gary Payton. The two wins against the Sonics marked the Wolves' first-ever playoff game wins. The off-season started poorly for the Timberwolves though as 20-point per game scorer Tom Gugliotta left for the Phoenix Suns. Garnett as a member of the Minnesota Timberwolves (2007) In the lockout-shortened season that followed, Garnett broke through as a superstar. Putting up stats of 20.8 points, 10.4 rebounds, 4.3 assists and 1.8 blocks per game, he was named to the All-NBA Third Team. However, midway through the season, Stephon Marbury was traded to the New Jersey Nets. Although the Wolves received two-time All- Star Terrell Brandon in return, they were not able to overcome the discord and limped into the playoffs as the eighth seed with a 25‚Äì25 record. The Wolves were defeated in the first round again, this time losing 3‚Äì1 to the eventual champion San Antonio Spurs who were led by young superstar and eventual NBA Finals MVP Tim Duncan. In the 1999‚Äì2000 NBA season, Garnett continued his notable play, averaging 22.9 points, 11.8 rebounds, 5.0 assists, 1.6 blocks and 1.5 steals per game. Garnett also made the first of his four All-NBA First Team appearances and came in second place in the MVP voting. Assisted by sharpshooting rookie forward Wally Szczerbiak and steady veteran Terrell Brandon, the Wolves posted a franchise-best 50‚Äì32 record, but succumbed in the first round to the Portland Trail Blazers 3‚Äì1. On May 20, 2000, Timberwolves' guard and Garnett's close friend Malik Sealy was killed by a drunk driver shortly after celebrating Garnett's 24th birthday.Sealy dies in collision with pickup truck, May 22, 2000 Later that year, the NBA ruled that the free agent signing of Joe Smith was illegal. The league punished the team for the illegal signing by stripping them of three first-round draft picks, fining Glen Taylor (the owner of the team) $3.5 million, and banning general manager Kevin McHale for one year. In the 2000‚Äì01 NBA season, Garnett led the Wolves to a 47‚Äì35 record and made the All-NBA Second Team, but again, the Wolves did not survive the first round of the playoffs, losing to the Spurs 3‚Äì1. MVP and division champions (2001‚Äì2004) In the 2001‚Äì02 season, Garnett posted another notable season, his averages of 21.2 points, 12.1 rebounds, 5.2 assists, 1.6 blocks and 1.2 steals per game enough for another All-NBA Second Team nomination. However, the Timberwolves bowed out in the first round for the sixth consecutive time, this time getting swept 3‚Äì0 by the Dallas Mavericks led by Michael Finley, Steve Nash and Dirk Nowitzki. Garnett's next season was one of the best of his career, his 23.0 ppg / 13.4 rpg / 6.0 apg / 1.6 bpg / 1.4 spg season earning him his second All-NBA First Team nomination and second place in the MVP voting. The Timberwolves posted a good 51‚Äì31 record, but for the seventh consecutive time, they did not make it out of the first round, this time losing to the Los Angeles Lakers 4‚Äì2. In the 2003‚Äì04 season, things finally seemed to come together for Garnett. In past years, the Wolves had practically been a one-man show, but now, the Timberwolves had made two valuable acquisitions: highly talented but volatile swingman Latrell Sprewell and the seasoned two-time NBA champion Sam Cassell, who supplanted Troy Hudson at point guard. In addition, defensive center Ervin Johnson complemented the inconsistent Michael Olowokandi. Powered by the best supporting cast up to this point in his career, Garnett averaged 24.2 points, 13.9 rebounds, 5.0 assists, 2.2 blocks and 1.5 steals per game for the season. Having recorded career-highs in points, rebounds, blocks and leading the league rebounds, Garnett was named the league Most Valuable Player for the first time in his career. With a franchise-record 58 wins, the Wolves stormed into the playoffs, and finally conquered their playoff bane by defeating the Denver Nuggets 4‚Äì1 in the first round. After disposing of the strong Sacramento Kings 4‚Äì3 in the Western Conference semi-finals, Garnett and the Timberwolves met the Lakers in the Western Conference Finals. There, playmaker Cassell went down with a back injury. With reserve point guard Hudson also injured, the Timberwolves alternated between third playmaker Darrick Martin and shooting guard Fred Hoiberg at the \\"one\\", or even running Garnett himself as point forward or a real point guard. The Los Angeles Lakers pulled off a 4‚Äì2 victory in the series. Frustration (2004‚Äì2007) In the 2004‚Äì05 season, Garnett was able to record a career-high in terms of scoring as he scored 47 points and grabbed 17 rebounds in a 115‚Äì122 loss to the Phoenix Suns. He was also named to the All-NBA Second Team, but the Timberwolves failed to make the playoffs for the first time in eight years with a record of 44‚Äì38. The 2005‚Äì06 season brought more frustration for Garnett. Sprewell turned down a three-year, $21 million extension, and the Wolves wary of his injuries and age, traded Cassell for the much less effective Marko Jariƒá, and the team's record for 2005‚Äì06 fell to 33‚Äì49. Despite Garnett's play, the team logged the second worst record since Garnett joined the franchise. Garnett subsequently earned All-NBA Third Team honors. During the 2007 off-season, Glen Taylor admitted that although he had planned on retaining Garnett, he would finally listen to trade offers. Garnett's name was mentioned in various trade rumors involving the Chicago Bulls, Los Angeles Lakers, Golden State Warriors, Indiana Pacers, Boston Celtics, Phoenix Suns and Dallas Mavericks. ===Boston Celtics (2007‚Äì2013)=== Garnett in Game 4 of the 2008 NBA Playoffs against the Atlanta Hawks.

On July 31, 2007, Garnett was traded to the Boston Celtics in exchange for Al Jefferson, Ryan Gomes, Sebastian Telfair, Gerald Green, Theo Ratliff, cash considerations, Boston's 2009 first-round draft pick (top 3 protected), and the 2009 first- round pick which Minnesota had traded to Boston in the Ricky Davis-Wally Szczerbiak trade of 2006.

Garnett said that he was proud to be a part of the Celtics, and hoped to continue its proud tradition and basketball success.Celtics, Minnesota Timberwolves agree to send Garnett to Boston On the day the trade was announced, Garnett signed a three-year, $60 million contract extension that would start after his prior deal ran out in 2009. On August 1, the day after signing with the Celtics, Garnett threw the ceremonial first pitch at Fenway Park prior to a Red Sox- Orioles game. The trade for Garnett had many experts speculating that the Celtics would have a resurgence during the 2007‚Äì08 season. The combination of Paul Pierce, Ray Allen, and Garnett were almost automatically nicknamed \\"The Big Three\\" by the media, after the Larry Bird, Kevin McHale, and Robert Parish trio. Garnett wore jersey number 5 for the Celtics since his number with the Timberwolves, number 21, was retired by the Celtics, previously worn by Bill Sharman.

Garnett helped the Celtics to their 17th NBA Championship, with 26 points and 14 rebounds in Game 6 of the NBA Finals. During that championship season, Garnett and Celtics legend Bill Russell developed a relationship, which Garnett credited as a major influence in helping him succeed during his first season as a Celtic. On June 18, 2008, Garnett and Ray Allen appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman, soon after winning the championship. In the 2008‚Äì09 season, Garnett started all of the 57 games he was able to suit up for. He averaged 15.8 points, 8.5 rebounds and 2.5 assists.

He was forced to miss the next 14 games. Upon his return from the injury, he averaged 9 points and 4.5 rebounds in four games before being shut down for the season permanently, missing the final 25 games of the regular season, as well as the 2009 playoffs due to a right knee sprain. Without Garnett, the Celtics advanced to the Eastern Conference semi-finals, but were eliminated by the Orlando Magic. In the 2009‚Äì10 season, Garnett and the Celtics, joined by newly signed free agent Rasheed Wallace, struggled with injuries and inconsistency throughout much of the regular season and earned the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs. Garnett was selected to play in the 2010 NBA All-Star Game (his 13th All-Star Game selection). Despite being written off by nearly every major sports analyst, the Celtics elevated their play and consistency, and dominated opponents much as they did during their 2008 championship run. They eliminated the Miami Heat, Cleveland Cavaliers, and Orlando Magic to advance to face the Los Angeles Lakers in the 2010 NBA Finals. In Game 6 against the Cavaliers, Garnett recorded 22 points, 12 rebounds and 3 assists in the series-clinching win. The 2010 Finals went to a decisive seventh game in Los Angeles, where the Celtics led well into the third quarter before the Lakers mounted a comeback and held on for the victory. In the 2010‚Äì11 NBA season, Garnett and the Celtics started strong, winning 23 of their first 26 games. On December 30, 2010, Garnett injured his right knee after he tried to dunk. He missed two weeks with the injury. Garnett returned on January 17, 2011 to face the Orlando Magic. The Celtics ended the regular season third in the Eastern Conference behind the Chicago Bulls and the Miami Heat. Garnett averaged under 15 points, under 9 rebounds, and a career low 0.8 blocks per game. After sweeping the New York Knicks in the first round, they faced the Heat in the semi-finals. After losing the first two games of the series, Garnett's playoff high 28 points helped the Celtics take Game 3. However, the Heat won the next two games, winning the series 4‚Äì1. In the lockout shortened 2011‚Äì12 NBA season, Garnett and the Celtics started off slowly, being below .500 with a 15‚Äì17 record by the All-Star break. Garnett was not selected for the All-Star game for the first time in 11 years. After, however, Boston quickly became one of the best teams in the league, finishing the second half of the season with a 24‚Äì10 record, entering the playoffs as the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference with a 39‚Äì27 record. Boston made a deep run in the playoffs, going all the way to the Eastern Conference Finals. They faced the Atlanta Hawks in the first round, defeating them in six games. Boston then defeated the Philadelphia 76ers after a challenging seven-game series. Boston made the Eastern Conference Finals for the third time in five years, and faced another superstar trio in Chris Bosh, Dwyane Wade and LeBron James of the Miami Heat. The Celtics lost the first two games, but came back strong to win the next three games. However, the Heat were too strong in Games 6 and 7, defeating the Celtics 4‚Äì3. Garnett found a resurgence in the playoffs, averaging 19.2 points, 10.3 rebounds and 1.4 blocks per game. On June 30, 2012, Garnett agreed to a three-year contract extension with the Celtics worth an estimated $34 million. On January 17, 2013, it was announced that Garnett had been voted to start in the 2013 All-Star Game in Houston. On February 7, 2013, Garnett recorded his 25,000th point in a 116‚Äì95 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers. ===Brooklyn Nets (2013‚Äì2015)=== On June 27, 2013, the day of the NBA draft, the Boston Celtics and the Brooklyn Nets reached a deal to trade Garnett, Paul Pierce and Jason Terry for future first-round picks in the 2014, 2016, and 2018 drafts, as well as Kris Humphries, Gerald Wallace, Kris Joseph, MarShon Brooks and Keith Bogans. The deal was finally completed on July 12, with Brooklyn also receiving D. J. White. Garnett chose to wear number 2 to honor his former Minnesota Timberwolves teammate Malik Sealy. On December 13, 2013, Garnett surpassed 14,000 career rebounds, becoming only the tenth player in NBA history to do so. In reaching the milestone, Garnett also joined Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Karl Malone as the only players to reach 25,000 points, 14,000 rebounds and 5,000 assists. He reached the milestone in the third quarter of a 103‚Äì99 road loss to the Detroit Pistons. The Nets cherished Garnett's leadership and passion. Despite boasting a starting line-up of Deron Williams, Joe Johnson, Brook Lopez, Paul Pierce, and Garnett, the Nets were unable to advance past the second round of the playoffs, while Garnett finished his 19th NBA season with career low averages of 6.5 points and 6.6 rebounds per game. On November 1, 2014, Garnett had arguably his best game for the Nets as he recorded 18 points and 14 rebounds in 35 minutes of action in the Nets' 102‚Äì90 win over the Detroit Pistons. Six days later, he recorded five rebounds in a 110‚Äì99 win over the New York Knicks and by doing so, passed Walt Bellamy for ninth place on the all-time rebounding list. ===Return to Minnesota (2015‚Äì2016)=== Garnett's first game back with the Timberwolves in 2015. On February 19, 2015, Garnett agreed to waive his no-trade clause in order to be traded back to Minnesota in exchange for Thaddeus Young. Six days later, he made his return for the Timberwolves against the Washington Wizards at the Target Center, recording five points on 2-of-7 shooting with eight rebounds and two blocks in 19 minutes in his first game for Minnesota since 2007. He appeared in just five games for the Timberwolves in 2014‚Äì15, before sitting out the team's final 21 games of the season due to a nagging knee injury. On July 11, 2015, Garnett re-signed with the Timberwolves to a two- year deal. On November 15, 2015, against the Memphis Grizzlies, Garnett became the fifth player in NBA history to play at least 50,000 minutes, joining Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Karl Malone, Jason Kidd and Elvin Hayes. On December 1, against the Orlando Magic, Garnett surpassed Kidd (50,110) for third on the NBA's career minutes list. Four days later, in a loss to the Portland Trail Blazers, he became the 15th player in NBA history to surpass 26,000 career points. On December 11, Garnett passed Malone as the NBA's all-time leader in defensive rebounds during Minnesota's 111‚Äì108 overtime loss to the Denver Nuggets. He finished the game with four defensive boards to give him 11,409 for his career, three ahead of Malone. Garnett appeared in 38 of the team's first 45 games of the season before missing the entire second half of the season with a right knee injury, the same knee that kept him out of 25 games in 2008‚Äì09 when he was playing for Boston, as well as much of his post-trade time in Minnesota during the 2014‚Äì15 season. On September 23, 2016, Garnett announced his retirement after 21 seasons in the NBA. While Garnett did express interest in playing for one more season with the Timberwolves, primarily with the goal in helping the team make it to the playoffs again with its promising young players and new head coach, he also told the team's owner that he wasn't sure that his knees would hold up for one more season. ==National team career== In the 2000 Summer Olympics, Garnett won a gold medal as a member of the United States national team. In his first and only FIBA tournament, Garnett averaged 10.8 points, 9.1 rebounds and 2.1 assists per game. ==Post-playing career== In October 2016, Garnett joined the crew on TNT's Inside the NBA. The following month, he became the host of his own segment, Area 21. In January 2017, Garnett joined the Los Angeles Clippers as a consultant. He also consulted with the Milwaukee Bucks during the 2016‚Äì17 season. ===Uncut Gems=== Garnett plays a fictionalized version of himself in the 2019 crime thriller film Uncut Gems, directed by the Safdie brothers. The movie is set in 2012 and revolves around the Eastern Conference Semi-finals series from that year between the Boston Celtics and Philadelphia 76ers. Garnett makes a trip from Philadelphia to a jewelry store owned by Adam Sandler's character Howard Ratner in New York's Diamond District and takes a liking to an Ethiopian opal which Ratner shows him; this leads to events that eventually spiral into chaos as the movie goes on. Garnett's performance received positive reviews from critics. The Safdie brothers arrived at Garnett after a series of rewrites based on player availability. Their choices before Garnett included Amar'e Stoudemire (refused to cut his hair to match the time period), Kobe Bryant (his representation said he wanted to direct, not act, though Bryant denied any knowledge of the project) and Joel Embiid (his schedule made it impossible to film). Garnett was one of the first retired athletes they approached. Garnett later said the process of filming \\"felt special, but you didn't know it.\\" ==Personal life== Garnett wore clothing branded as \\"OBF\\", standing for Official Block Family. The name came from what he called his close group of friends from Beechwood Court in Mauldin, South Carolina. He brought OBF members to live with him in his Minnesota home, and let some on board some team's charter flights during road trips. He met Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, the Grammy-winning record producers for Janet Jackson and Boyz II Men, early in his career in Minnesota and considers them as mentors. In July 2004, Garnett married his longtime girlfriend Brandi Padilla during a private ceremony in California. Due to the wedding, Garnett did not take part in the Athens Olympic Games.Marc Stein Team USA carousel continues, ESPN, April 29, 2004. The couple has two daughters. On July 12, 2018, Garnett's wife filed for divorce, asking for custody of the children. Garnett is the half- brother of former basketball player Louis McCullough. Another professional basketball player, former Los Angeles Laker Shammond Williams, is his cousin. His nicknames include \\"The Big Ticket\\", \\"KG\\", \\"The Kid\\" and formerly \\"The Franchise\\" (after being known as the Minnesota Timberwolves' franchise player). Before games, he mentally prepares himself by banging his head against a padded basketball stanchion. Although Garnett is officially listed as by the NBA, he is widely accepted to be at least tall.Peter Stringer, Postgame Wrap Up ‚Äì KG or K9?, Celtics.com, March 28, 2008.Shira Springer, Garnett deal in place, The Boston Globe, July 30, 2007. During the 2007 NBA All-Star Game, Garnett admitted in an interview with Craig Sager to be \\"6 ft 11 in and some quarters\\" tall. Measurements from the 1995 NBA draft indicated that Garnett, who was 19 years old at the time, was tall barefoot. In 1997, Garnett was measured by the Minnesota Timberwolves training staff to be tall in his basketball shoes.\\"Missed Workouts Put Garnett 'A Little Behind'\\", St. Paul Pioneer Press, October 3, 1997. Page 7E. In December 2011, Garnett agreed to become a limited shareholder of American-owned Italian Serie A football team A.S. Roma. ==NBA career statisticsRegular season=== -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Minnesota  80  43  28.7  .491  .286  .705  6.3  1.8  1.1  1.6  10.4 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Minnesota  77  77  38.9  .499  .286  .754  8.0  3.1  1.4  2.1  17.0 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Minnesota  cfecec;\\" 82*  cfecec;\\" 82*  39.3  .491  .188  .738  9.6  4.2  1.7  1.8  18.5 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Minnesota  47  47  37.9  .460  .286  .704  10.4  4.3  1.7  1.8  20.8 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Minnesota  81  81  40.0  .497  .370  .765  11.8  5.0  1.5  1.6  22.9 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Minnesota  81  81  39.5  .477  .288  .764  11.4  5.0  1.4  1.8  22.0 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Minnesota  81  81  39.2  .470  .319  .801  12.1  5.2  1.2  1.6  21.2 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Minnesota  cfecec;\\" 82*  cfecec;\\" 82*  40.5  .502  .282  .751  13.4  6.0  1.4  1.6  23.0 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Minnesota  cfecec;\\" 82*  cfecec;\\" 82*  39.4  .499  .256  .791  cfecec;\\" 13.9  5.0  1.5  2.2  24.2 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Minnesota  cfecec;\\" 82*  cfecec;\\" 82*  38.1  .502  .240  .811  cfecec;\\" 13.5*  5.7  1.5  1.4  22.2 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  style=\\"text- align:left;\\" Minnesota  76  76  38.9  .526  .267  .810  cfecec;\\" 12.7*  4.1  1.4  1.4  21.8 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Minnesota  76  76  39.4  .476  .214  .835  cfecec;\\" 12.8*  4.1  1.2  1.7  22.4 -  style=\\"text-align:left;

Located in the Sydney harbourside suburb of , New South Wales, the house is at the far eastern end of Kirribilli Avenue. It is one of two official Prime Ministerial residences, the primary official residence being The Lodge in Canberra, Australian Capital Territory. The house, gardens and grounds are listed on the Commonwealth Heritage List. Scott Morrison currently uses the house as his primary residence. ==Overview== In 1854, merchant Adolphus Frederic Feez purchased a parcel of land at the tip of Kirribilli Point for ¬£200. The land had been sliced off the grounds of adjacent Wotonga House, which now forms part of Admiralty House, but was then in private ownership. Feez built the picturesque Gothic-style structure now known as Kirribilli House ‚Äì a twin-gabled dwelling or cottage orn√©e ‚Äì on the land's highest spot. The house features steeply pitched roofs, fretwork, bargeboards and bay windows. It passed through many private hands until it was purchased in 1919 for ¬£10,000 by Arthur Wigram Allen. Allen planned to subdivide the land but after much public agitation the then Prime Minister of Australia, Billy Hughes, resumed the property for Government purposes in 1920. The property was used by the staff of the Governor-General of Australia (who occupied neighbouring Admiralty House) until 1930, when it was leased to tenants. In 1956 Kirribilli House was set aside as a residence for the use of Australia's Prime Ministers, when they need to perform public duties and extend official hospitality on behalf of the government during stays in Sydney. The official Prime Ministerial residence is The Lodge, Canberra. Kirribilli House is situated on the North Shore of Sydney Harbour, in the suburb of Kirribilli. It commands impressive views across to the Sydney Harbour Bridge, Circular Quay and the Sydney Opera House and has been visited over the years by many important international dignitaries. During the term (1996‚Äì2007) of John Howard, a Sydney resident, Kirribilli House was the primary residence of the Prime Minister. On 29 March 2013 Tony Abbott announced he was going to make Kirribilli his home, citing pressure from security advisers. Scott Morrison, a Sydney resident, moved into Kirribilli House in September 2018. Kirribilli House is open to the public on one day a year, courtesy of The Australiana Fund. ==HistoryAdolphus Frederic Feez=== Adolphus Frederic Feez, who built Kirribilli House in 1855, was born in Germany in 1826.New South Wales Certificate of Naturalisation, No. 39 1854. He went first to London in 1849 and is listed on the Certificate of Arrival as being a merchant and an architect. In 1851 he immigrated to Sydney on the ship Envelope. He established himself as a successful merchant and was a partner in the trading company called Rabone, Feez and Co. His brother was Albrecht Feez, who later became a prominent citizen in Rockhampton. Feez lived in Kirribilli House for several years which was then called Sophienberg. He then moved to Balmain.Sands Directory He married Frederica and had two children while living in Sydney.New South Wales Birth Certificates 1867/ 2760 and 1870/2940 While on a business trip to Fiji he died in 1869 at the age of only 43.England & Wales, National Probate Calendar (Index of Wills and Administrations), 1881, page 31.

The House was bought by Arthur Wigram Allen who planned to subdivide the land. In 1920 he produced a brochure with a photo of the house and the planned subdivision. There was public outcry about the sale of the house and the Government under the then Prime Minister Billy Hughes decided to resume it. The property has remained in Government ownership since then. == Prime Minister's residence  John Howard === House entrance Although Kirribilli was never intended to be the Australian Prime Minister's official primary place of residence, John Howard attracted much adverse comment when he announced at the beginning of his Prime Ministership in 1996 that he would use Kirribilli House as his primary place of residence. Howard would use The Lodge as a residence when in Canberra for parliamentary or government business, though lived primarily at Kirribilli House. Howard is a lifelong Sydney-sider, and represented the Sydney-area seat of Bennelong in Parliament. He said at the time he commenced his Prime Ministership that he had made this decision so that his family could remain together while his three children lived at home and one son attended high school in Sydney. Kirribilli House was renovated to enable a family of five to live there on a permanent basis. Howard's decision raised ire particularly in Melbourne, since the main reason Canberra was established as Australia's capital was to avoid giving that status to either of Australia's two largest cities, Sydney and Melbourne. At the time of Federation, the century-long rivalry between Sydney and Melbourne was so heated that it was believed neither city would accept the other as capital. Howard's explanation left open the possibility that once his children had left home, he would then take up residence in Canberra at The Lodge. However, after his children had all left home, Howard chose to remain at Kirribilli House. He sometimes said that The Lodge was effectively his main residence due to his work requiring him to be in Canberra more often than in Sydney, but he has never retreated from his decision in principle to base himself at Kirribilli House whenever he was not needed in Canberra. Kirribilli House is less than 10 kilometres from Howard's longtime seat of Bennelong. === Kevin Rudd === Following the defeat of the Liberal-National coalition government at the 2007 federal election, Howard, who was Australia's second longest-serving prime minister, and his family vacated Kirribilli House. Kirribilli House returned to being the Prime Minister's Sydney residence, as Howard's successor, Kevin Rudd, indicated that he would make The Lodge his main and primary residence. === Scott Morrison === Scott Morrison stays at The Lodge when he is in Canberra for parliamentary or government business, but lives primarily at Kirribilli House, Sydney. Morrison stated that this was to ensure that his daughters could continue to 'live as normal a life as is possible'. == Gallery == ==References== ==External links== * Kirribilli House * The Australiana Fund * Proposal for an official residence in Melbourne Category:Official residences in Australia Category:Prime ministerial residences Category:Buildings of the Australian government Category:Prime Minister of Australia Category:Victorian architecture in Sydney Category:Commonwealth Heritage List places in New South Wales Category:1855 establishments in Australia Category:Government buildings in Sydney Category:Houses in Kirribilli ","title":"Kirribilli House"},{"id":"525758","text":"Albert Edgar Hickman (August 2, 1875 ‚Äì February 9, 1943) was the seventeenth Prime Minister of Newfoundland and has the distinction of having served the shortest term of any Prime Minister. ==Biography== Albert Hickman was born in Grand Bank on August 2, 1875.

Hickman invited members of various former members of the Liberal Reform Party as well as members of other parties into his government which he called the Liberal-Progressive Party. His new party was defeated in the 9 June 1924 election by former supporters of Warren who joined with the conservative opposition to form the Liberal-Conservative Progressive Party.

It is located in the suburb of Kirribilli, on the northern foreshore of Sydney Harbour (adjacent to Kirribilli House, which is the Sydney official residence of the Australian Prime Minister). This large Victorian Regency and Italianate sandstone manor, completed in stages based on designs by James Barnet and Walter Liberty Vernon, occupies the tip of Kirribilli Point. Once known as \\"Wotonga\\", it has commanding views across Sydney Harbour to the Sydney Harbour Bridge and the Sydney Opera House. Its current name originates in the fact that it served as the residence for the Commander-in- Chief of the Royal Navy's Australia Squadron from 1885 to 1913. The original building on the site was completed, as a private dwelling, in mid-to-late 1843, by John George Nathaniel Gibbes, the then Collector of Customs for New South Wales and a member of the New South Wales Legislative Council. A portrait of Gibbes, painted in 1808, hangs in the house. On 22 June 2004 Admiralty House was placed on the Commonwealth Heritage List. ==HistoryEarly history=== Before the arrival of British settlers in Sydney Harbour, the Aboriginal Cammeraygal people lived along the Kirribilli and Milsons Point foreshores, and in the surrounding bushland. The area was a fertile fishing ground, and thus the name Kirribilli is derived from the Aboriginal word kiarabilli, which means \\"good fishing spot\\". The name Cammeraygal is displayed on the North Sydney Municipal Council emblem, and also gave name to the suburb of Cammeray. Kirribilli was settled early in the history of the Colony. One of the first records of land being granted on the North Shore was on the North side of the Harbour of Port Jackson opposite Sydney Cove on 20 February 1794 to an expired convict, Samuel Lightfoot.Note that this was not the earliest grant on the north shore, earlier grants had occurred since 1792 (e.g. to John or Joseph Carter) at the Field of Mars further up the north shoreLand grants 1788‚Äì1809, page 18-19, Grant No. 151 (believed to be a reproduction of AO reel 2560) Lightfoot was a former convict, born in about 1763 and transported to Australia for seven years for stealing clothing. He arrived with the First Fleet in 1788 on the Charlotte. In 1794 Thomas Muir, a Scottish constitutional reformer, was sentenced to transportation for sedition. Thomas Muir purchased Lightfoot's farm. Muir also had a cottage on what is now Circular Quay. It is likely that the farm was located at the Jeffrey Street end of Kirribilli (not near Admiralty house) and was named \\"Huntershill\\" by Thomas Muir, after his father's home in Scotland. Thomas Muir escaped from the colony in 1796 aboard an American brig, the Otter. Four years later the Colonial Secretary recorded that the land grant to Lightfoot was cancelled and given to Robert Ryan in 1800 with no mention of the intermediate (private) sale to Muir. Ryan had worked in Norfolk Island, both as a soldier and also a settler. The of Lightfoot's Grant was cancelled and included in a grant to Ryan for his service in the Royal Marines and the NSW Corps. The corresponding entry in the Register of Land Grants states Cancelled, and a New Grant given to Robert Ryan for 90 acres in addition to this Allotment, by Governor Hunter. See the third Register, Folio 37.Missing land grants in New South Wales, 1792‚Äì1800, A. G. L. Shawa This grant to Ryan included almost all Kirribilli and later maps referred. By 1801, the property had passed into the hands of Robert Campbell, a wealthy Sydney merchant. Campbell built Australia's first shipbuilding yards in 1807, at the site that is now occupied by the Royal Sydney Yacht Squadron, Kirribilli. Part of the land in Kirribilli was also briefly used for quarantine purposes in 1814 for the convict ship Surry. Over 46 persons had died during the voyage of typhoid including 36 convicts. Campbell's property in Kirribilli was used for grazing under lease to Campbell's friend James Milson, hence the name \\"Milson's Point\\". Milson's Point is the next point along from Kirribilli point, where the Sydney Harbour Bridge now crosses the harbour. A plan of sub-division was drawn up in the 1840s by Campbell. In 1842, the site where Admiralty House now sits was leased to the Collector of Customs for the Colony, Lieutenant-Colonel (later full Colonel) Gibbes, MLC. Gibbes intended to build a private home on the site. (Since his arrival in the colony in 1834, Gibbes and his family had been living in Henrietta Villa, also known as the Naval Villa, on Sydney's Point Piper, under a leasehold arrangement.) ===Private residence=== Colonel John George Nathaniel Gibbes and Elizabeth Gibbes, 1865. The building that would become Admiralty House was initially erected by the Gibbes family. On the superb Kirribilli Point location, Gibbes erected, between 1842 and 1843, a graceful single-storey house with wide verandahs and elegant French doors. Gibbes designed the house, which he called \\"Wotonga\\" (or \\"Woottonga\\"), himself. The stone for the house's walls was quarried locally and the hardwood and cedar joinery came from George Coleson's timber-yard in George Street, Sydney. Gibbes engaged James Hume, a well-known builder who dabbled in ecclesiastical architecture, to supervise the construction of the building and its stables. Gibbes, however, hired his own masons, bricklayers, carpenters, plumbers and ironmongers to work on the project, paying each of them separately as work progressed. Gibbes used the Custom Department's cutter to commute to and from the building site. Once completed, Gibbes' L-shaped residence featured a plain, yet stylish, double fa√ßade to maximise the building's magnificent, sweeping views across Sydney Harbour. These views enabled Gibbes to monitor shipping traffic in and out of Darling Harbour and, more importantly, Circular Quay, where the Sydney Customs House was situated. Today, Wotonga forms the core of Admiralty House and the building's 180-degree, east-west panoramic sight-lines are even more spectacular than they were in Gibbes' day, owing to the subsequent high-rise growth of Sydney's CBD. Gibbes, incidentally, was said to be the illegitimate child of His Royal Highness Frederick, Duke of York, (King George III's second son). This reputed connection to the British monarchy adds spice to the house on Kirribilli Point's subsequent role as a vice-regal establishment.Gibbes, Stephen, \\"John Gibbes: Builder of Admiralty House\\", North Sydney Historical Journal, Volume 37, Number 1, April 1997, pp. 8‚Äì12. In 1849, Robert Campbell died and the executors of the estate sold the property, comprising the house and land, to Gibbes for about A¬£1,400. On 27 December 1851, Gibbes, who was contemplating a departure from the Customs Service at the age of 64, sold the property to James Lindsay Travers, a merchant of Macquarie Place, Sydney, for ¬£1,533. (Gibbes subsequently changed his mind about leaving his position as head of the NSW Customs Department; instead, he leased Greycliffe House at Shark Beach, Vaucluse, from the Wentworth family and remained in Sydney for the better part of eight years, eventually retiring to Yarralumla homestead, now the official Canberra residence of the Governor-General of Australia, in 1859.) A small portion of the Kirribilli Point land, a little over was sold by Travers in 1854 to a merchant, Adolph Frederic Feez. On this land, Kirribilli House was built in neo-Gothic style . Kirribilli House, situated next door to Admiralty House, serves today as the official Sydney residence of the Prime Minister of Australia. Crimean War interlude In 1855, during the Crimean War, Governor William Denison reclaimed the tip of Kirribilli Point, on which fortifications were built. These fortifications, along with Fort Denison, were intended to strengthen the defences of Sydney Harbour, as it was feared that the Russians might attack. In 1856, Lieutenant-Colonel George Barney, a Royal Engineers officer, lived in \\"Wotonga\\" and designed and supervised the installation of a battery of five, muzzle-loading guns on Kirribilli Point, as well as constructing the martello tower at Fort Denison. Lassetter, Wilshire, and Cadell The residence, when it was known as Wotonga, and owned by Thomas Cadell, c. 1880 In 1856, Lieutenant-Colonel Barney bought the house and its grounds so that he could view all of the sites that he had fortified. In September 1860, Barney sold the house and grounds for ¬£9,000 to George Alfred Lloyd. In 1866, it was let to Frederick Lassetter and subsequently to James Robert Wilshire, a former Lord Mayor of Sydney and a Member of the New South Wales Legislative Council from 1858 to 1861. In April 1874, Wotonga House was auctioned and bought for ¬£10,100 by Thomas Cadell, a Sydney merchant and member of the New South Wales Legislative Council from 1881 to 1896. At that time, the house was described as possessing a wide verandah, a spacious entrance hall, drawing and dining rooms, 10 bedrooms and the \\"'usual rooms\\"\\" in the main part of the house, as well as having a large courtyard, servant's rooms, kitchen, stables, etc., with an abundant water supply, which never failed in the driest weather. ===Admiralty=== In 1885, the Royal Navy's Australian Squadron was raised to the status of an Admiral's command in recognition of the colony's growing importance. The colonial government bought \\"Wotonga\\" as residence for the Admiral of the Navy. The house was renamed \\"Admiralty House\\" and additions were made to the property. A second storey was added to the house, as was a colonnaded verandah. A neo- Gothic style gate lodge was also added to the grounds, as was a covered Admiral's Walk leading down to the berth for the Admiral's barge below. In 1913, this part of the history of Admiralty House came to a close when the last British admiral left the house and the Royal Australian Navy took over responsibility for the naval defence of Australia. From the Federation of Australia in 1901, the Government House of New South Wales in Farm Cove was used as the Sydney residence of the Governor-General. In 1912, the Government of New South Wales decided to put the building to public purposes once more, leaving the Governor-General of the period, Lord Denman, without a Sydney residence. ===Government House=== With the departure of the last British Admiral from Admiralty House in 1913, the Admiralty handed the house back to the New South Wales Government. This provided Lord Denman's successor, Sir Ronald Munro Ferguson, with a Sydney residence. Admiralty House was the residence of the Governors-General for the following fifteen years. Admiralty House in 1930. The building was closed that year, and was not reopened until 1936. In 1930, during the Great Depression, the Scullin Government had Admiralty House closed, and its contents were sold at Auction in 1931. Governor-General Sir Isaac Isaacs, appointed in 1931, was the first Governor- General to live permanently at Yarralumla, in Canberra. During his term, Admiralty House remained empty and neglected. Sir Isaac described it in 1934 as being \\"stripped of its glamour, with no furnishings but a few fine mirrors, its garden wild and overgrown\\". In 1936, the State of New South Wales reopened Admiralty House as the Sydney residence for the new Governor-General, Lord Gowrie. The house has been used ever since as a vice-regal establishment. Formal title to Admiralty House finally passed from the State Government to the Commonwealth by Crown grant in 1948, on the condition that the house was to be used only as a residence for the Governor-General. ==Functions== Duke and Duchess of Cambridge with Governor-General Peter Cosgrove at Admiralty House, 2014 Admiralty House is an official residence of the Governor-General of Australia, and accommodates important overseas visitors to Sydney. The Royal Family and other dignitaries, such as the President of the United States and the Pope, are entertained at Admiralty House when they are in Sydney. Admiralty House, its grounds, and Kirribilli House are usually open to the public once a year, sometime in spring when the gardens are at their best. Security concerns caused the cancellation of openings from 2001 to 2005. ==ArchitectureInterior=== The ground floor of the house contains a vestibule and hallway, two reception rooms, a dining-room, a study and an elaborate central staircase. The residents' private rooms are on the upper floors. A landing on the staircase features elaborate stained glass panels in its windows. Kitchens and other service areas are housed in a wing added to the original structure. A stone gatehouse guards the front entrance to the establishment. The house is furnished extensively with colonial furniture, porcelain, ornaments and numerous historical artworks such as portraits of Captain James Cook and some former Governors-General, including Hallam Tennyson, 2nd Baron Tennyson. Many of these items were acquired for the nation by The Australiana Fund. ==See also== *Government Houses of Australia *Government Houses of the British Empire *Governor-General of Australia ==ReferencesBibliography=== * Clifford-Smith, Silas; 'Admiralty House', Oxford Companion to Australian Gardens, South Melbourne, 2002 * Kerr, John Semple, Admiralty House: A Conservation Plan Developed for the Department of Housing and Construction, Sydney, 1987 * Messent, David & McGonigal, David; The Complete Guide to Sydney Harbour; David Messent Photography, 1994 * Steele, Jeremy, Sydney Cove to the Heads; The University of Sydney, 1978 * Stephensen, PR & Kennedy, Brian; The History and Description of Sydney Harbour; Reed Publishing, 1966 & 1980 * Thompson, CJ; Admiralty House, Sydney ‚Äì Brief History and Catalogue of Contents of State Rooms; Government House, Canberra, 1984 ==External links== * The Governor General of the Commonwealth of Australia: The History of Admiralty House: 1794‚Äì1948 * The Australiana Fund: Admiralty House * North Sydney Council: The Face of North Sydney Image Library Category:Official residences in Australia Sydney Category:Buildings of the Australian government Category:Government of Australia Category:1843 establishments in Australia Category:Commonwealth Heritage List places in New South Wales Category:Walter Liberty Vernon buildings in Sydney Category:James Barnet buildings in Sydney Category:Italianate architecture in Sydney Category:Victorian Regency architecture in New South Wales Category:Government buildings in Sydney Category:Houses in Kirribilli ","title":"Admiralty House, Sydney"},{"id":"525768","text":"Rapho may refer to: * Rapho (agency), a French photo agency *Rapho Township, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania ","title":"Rapho"},{"id":"525778","text":" YermakSometimes romanized as Ermak.

She was named after the famous Russian explorer of Siberia, Don Cossack ataman Yermak Timofeyevich. She was commissioned on 17 October 1898. She arrived in Kronstadt on 4 March 1899 after breaking through ice and a formal reception was held to mark her arrival. Later in 1899 she reached 81¬∞21'N north of Spitsbergen. She had been constructed to break through heavy ice (up to 2 m in thickness). Yermak had been used in the winter of 1899‚Äì1900 to set up the first radio communication link in Russia between Kotka and Gogland (Suursaar) island (distance 47 km). In 1900 she came to the aid of the cruiser Gromoboi which had grounded in the Baltic. Between 1899‚Äì1911 Yermak sailed in heavy ice conditions for more than 1000 days. During World War I she assisted the Baltic Fleet during the Ice cruise when the fleet was evacuated from Helsinki to Kronstadt in February 1918. During World War II the Yermak was mobilised again and took part in the evacuation of Hanko naval base. She was armed with two 102 mm, two 76 mm, four 45 mm and four machine guns. Yermak served with different branches of the Russian and Soviet Navy and Merchant Marine up until 1964, becoming one of the longest-serving icebreakers in the world. An island in the Nordenski√∂ld Archipelago was named after her. A monument to the icebreaker Yermak was unveiled in Murmansk In November 1965 ‚Äì this included mosaic panels and the original anchor on the pedestal. Another icebreaker with the name Yermak was built for the Soviet Union at the W√§rtsil√§ Helsinki shipyard, Finland in 1974.

It is part of the Ma Wan constituency of the Tsuen Wan District Council. Yam O was the only natural lumber preservation zone in Hong Kong. Even today, travellers passing through Yam O can see natural lumber on stilts in the bay. Today, Yam O is known for its interchange for the Disneyland Resort Line via the nearby Sunny Bay MTR station, built on reclaimed land near Yam O. ==History== Plans were made in the PADS (Port and Airport Development Strategy) of 1989 to reclaim the bay for ancillary port facilities. The bay was eventually reclaimed in the 2000s under the Northeast Lantau Development Strategy to accommodate a tourism gateway to Hong Kong Disneyland; this included Sunny Bay Station. ==Sunny Bay== Sunny Bay MTR Station, as viewed from the Public Transport Interchange Sunny Bay () is a recent incarnation by the Hong Kong Government, which emerged after the plans to build Hong Kong Disneyland Resort on nearby Penny's Bay. This was done so because Yam () in Cantonese literally means dark (the same word as the Mandarin yin, well known to most English speakers from the expression yin- yang); while Yan () means happy - a significantly more favorable name to Disney. But according to Shuowen Jiezi, Yam () originally is a geographical syntax which means \\"North of a hill or south of a body of water\\", so the change of the name is seen a violation of local culture and opposed by Hong Kong citizens and some Chinese language professionals.

Natural childbirth arose in opposition to the techno- medical model of childbirth that has recently gained popularity in industrialized societies. Natural childbirth attempts to minimize medical intervention, particularly the use of anesthetic medications and surgical interventions such as episiotomies, forceps and ventouse deliveries and caesarean sections. Natural childbirth may occur during a physician or midwife attended hospital birth, a midwife attended homebirth, or an unassisted birth. The term \\"natural childbirth\\" was coined by obstetrician Grantly Dick-Read upon publication of his book Natural Childbirth in the 1930s, which was followed by the 1942 Childbirth Without Fear. ==History== Historically, most women gave birth at home without emergency medical care available. The \\"natural\\" rate of maternal mortality‚Äîmeaning without surgical or pharmaceutical intervention‚Äîhas been estimated at 1,500 per 100,000 births. In the United States circa 1900, before the introduction and improvement of modern medical technologies, there were about 700 maternal deaths per 100,000 births (.7%).Van Lerberghe W, De Brouwere V. Of blind alleys and things that have worked: history‚Äôs lessons on reducing maternal mortality. In: De Brouwere V, Van Lerberghe W, eds. Safe motherhood strategies: a review of the evidence. Antwerp, ITG Press, 2001 (Studies in Health Services Organisation and Policy, 17:7‚Äì33). \\"Where nothing effective is done to avert maternal death, ‚Äúnatural‚Äù mortality is probably of the order of magnitude of 1,500/100,000...In the USA of 1900, for example, there were about 700 maternal deaths for 100,000 births\\" At the onset of the Industrial Revolution, giving birth at home became more difficult due to congested living spaces and dirty living conditions. This drove urban and lower class women to newly available hospitals, while wealthy and middle-class women continued to labor at home. In the early 1900s there was an increasing availability of hospitals, and more women began going into the hospital for labor and delivery. In the United States, the middle classes were especially receptive to the medicalization of childbirth, which promised a safer and less painful labor. The ability to birth without pain was part of the early feminist movement. The use of childbirth drugs began in 1847 when Scottish obstetrician James Young Simpson introduced chloroform as an anesthetic during labor, but only the most rich and powerful women (such as Queen Victoria) had access. In the late 1800s, feminists in the United States and United Kingdom began to demand drugs for pain relief during childbirth. However, well into the first decades of the 20th century, unmedicated birth assisted by midwives was still commonplace in rural areas and some urban centers as well. The term \\"natural childbirth\\" was coined by obstetrician Grantly Dick-Read upon publication of his book Natural Childbirth in 1933. In the book, Dick-Read defined the term as the absence of any intervention that would otherwise disturb the sequence of labor. The book argued that because of \\"civilized\\" British women fear birth the birthrate was dropping, and if women were not to fear birth, birthing would be easier since fear creates tension which, in turn, causes pain. In 1942, Dick-Read published Revelation of Childbirth (which was later retitled Childbirth without Fear), advocating natural childbirth, which became an international bestseller. In the late 1940s, he brought his ideas to America, but saw similar ideas with differing names ‚Äì ‚Äúpain-free birth‚Äù and ‚Äúprepared childbirth‚Äù ‚Äì were already gaining traction. The appeal of natural childbirth rested in the idea that merging physiological, psychological, social, and spiritual aspects of reproduction would create the best comprehensive care. The Lamaze method gained popularity in the United States after Marjorie Karmel wrote about her experiences in her 1959 book Thank You, Dr. Lamaze, and with the formation of the American Society for Psychoprophylaxis in Obstetrics (currently Lamaze International) by Karmel and Elisabeth Bing. The Bradley method of natural childbirth (also known as \\"husband-coached childbirth\\"), a method of natural childbirth developed in 1947 by Robert A. Bradley, M.D., was popularized by his book Husband-Coached Childbirth, first published in 1965. In the 1970s, natural childbirth became a movement associated with feminism and consumerism, stressing obstetrics' lack of concern for the whole person and technology a method for controlling women's bodies. Michel Odent and midwives such as Ina May Gaskin promoted birthing centers, water birth, and homebirth as alternatives to the hospital model. Fr√©d√©rick Leboyer is often mistakenly believed to have advocated for water births, but he actually rejected the alternative as he felt it was not beneficial to the health of the baby. In 1976, Gaskin wrote the book Spiritual Midwifery, which described the beauty and power of unmedicated home births. ==Psychological aspects== Many women consider natural birth empowering and gives women more control in the birth process, pushing against the paternalistic medical establishment.Having a Great Birth in Australia, David Vernon, Australian College of Midwives, 2005 Studies show that skin-to-skin contact between a mother and her newborn immediately after birth is beneficial for both mother and baby. A review done by the World Health Organization found that skin-to-skin contact between mothers and babies after birth reduces crying, improves mother-infant interaction, and helps mothers to breastfeed successfully. They recommend that neonates be allowed to bond with the mother during their first two hours after birth, the period that they tend to be more alert than in the following hours of early life. ==Alternatives to intervention== Instead of medical interventions, a variety of non-invasive methods are employed during natural childbirth to ease the mother's pain. Many of these techniques stress the importance of \\"a mind-body connection,\\" which the techno-medical model of birth does not. These techniques include hydrotherapy, massage, relaxation therapy, hypnosis, breathing exercises, acupressure for labor, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), vocalization, visualization, mindfulness and water birth. Other approaches include movement, walking, and different positions (for example, using a birthing ball), hot and cold therapy (for example, using hot compresses and/or cold packs), and receiving one-on-one labor support like that provided by a midwife or doula. However, natural childbirth proponents maintain that pain is a natural and necessary part of the labor process, and should not automatically be regarded as entirely negative. In contrast to the pain of injury and disease, they believe that the pain of childbirth is a sign that the female body is functioning as it is meant to. Birth positions favored in natural childbirth‚Äîincluding squatting, hands and knees, or suspension in water‚Äîcontrast with the lithotomy position (woman in hospital bed on her back with legs in stirrups), which has consistently been shown to slow and complicate labor. Methods to reduce tearing during natural childbirth (instead of an episiotomy) include managing the perineum with counter-pressure, hot compresses, and pushing the baby out slowly. ==Preparation== Some women take birth education classes such as Lamaze or the Bradley Method to prepare for a natural childbirth. Several books are also available with information to help women prepare. A midwife or doula may include preparation for a natural birth as part of the prenatal care services. However, a study published in 2009 suggests that preparation alone is not enough to ensure an intervention-free outcome.Wiley Interscience ==Prevalence of medical intervention in the U.S.== In the U.S in 2007: 93% of mothers used electronic fetal monitoring; 63% used epidurals; 55% had their membranes ruptured; 53% received oxytocin to stimulate labor progress; and 52% received episiotomies. ==Criticisms== Some studies argue that the push towards 'natural childbirth' in Western countries is exaggerated, and can harm women.Articles: * * * Some women also express shame when not able to have a ‚Äúnatural birth,‚Äù feeling that their bodies may be defective or lessen the experiences of individuals using assisted reproductive technologies, or who are adoptive parents and parents who use surrogates. ==See also== * Bradley method of natural childbirth * Childbirth positions * Early postnatal hospital discharge * Home birth * Hypnotherapy in childbirth * Natural Hospital Birth, 2011 book * Squatting position ==Further reading== * Durand, Mark A.

The game follows the player's character, a hero of King Maximus, appointed with the job of retrieving the Sceptre of Order from the forces of chaos, led by Arech Dragonbreath. King's Bounty is notably considered the forerunner of the Heroes of Might and Magic series of games, while it was itself clearly \\"inspired\\" by the game Chaos: The Battle of Wizards for the ZX Spectrum. A Sega Genesis port was developed and released in North America on February 21, 1991, with a multitude of graphical changes. The gameplay was also modified to incorporate real time overworld exploration. In 2008, a spiritual sequel titled King's Bounty: The Legend was released. This was followed by additional sequels including King's Bounty: Armored Princess, King's Bounty: Crossworlds, King's Bounty: Warriors of the North, and King's Bounty: Dark Side. In August 2019, a sequel to King's Bounty: The Legend called King's Bounty II was announced and is due to be released in March 2021. ==Gameplay== The player leads the hero and his army across the four continents, acquiring up to 25 pieces of a map revealing the hidden location to the Sceptre of Order before King Maximus dies. Various details of this task are left to player's discretion, allowing for flexible gameplay. For instance, not all the scattered map sections are required; if the player is able to correctly determine the location of the sceptre's burial spot before acquiring all 25 map pieces, the game is won. If the sceptre is not recovered before King Maximus dies (the time varies depending on difficulty setting), the game ends in defeat. The location of the sceptre, the artifacts and which castles the villains inhabit are all randomized each game, adding to its replayability. The hero is given a weekly commission from the king to track down 17 villains across the 4 continents. With each defeat of the progressively stronger villain's army, the character claims (along with the reward money for the \\"King's Bounty\\" on that villain) another piece of the map revealing the sceptre's burial location. Along the way, numerous treasure chests are encountered scattered across the map. Some of these chests represent various events that increase the hero's inherent abilities, such as magical strength or weekly income; others may contain one of eight artifacts, which themselves provide a piece of the map, in addition to conferring their own unique powers. As the player explores, he encounters various types of creatures native to the different continents, some of which are able to be recruited. Most of these creatures are significant upgrades from the normal human forces available to the player at the King's castle, and are required to defeat the tougher villain armies. However, as their strength increases, so does the amount of gold required to retain them, which must be paid weekly. Although the player's commission can be raised in a variety of ways, such as maintaining a garrison of forces at a captured castle, if their costs exceed their income for too long, and they run out of money, their army will abandon them. Furthermore, each of the various army units have either a positive, neutral, or negative predisposition towards other. An army composed of creatures that \\"dislike\\" each other lowers their \\"morale\\", making them much less effective in combat. Conversely, recruiting creatures which share a positive predisposition towards each other increases their morale. Assembling an \\"ideal\\" army is another open-ended aspect of the game. King's Bounty features four selectable hero classes: Barbarian, Knight, Paladin, and Sorceress. Each class varies in magical ability, starting troop power, natural leadership ability, and Commissions (income per week). As the king's bounty is collected on more villains, the king may increase the rank of the hero. This rank determines in part what troops the hero may recruit, and more importantly, the strength of the hero's attributes. Combat in King's Bounty occurs when sieging an occupied castle or engaging a wandering army on the main map. Combat turns are simple, with the player's army moving first, followed by the opponent's. Armies are stack-based, with any one stack taking up one square on the battlefield. Stacks can represent anything from one cavalry unit to thousands of peasants. The player can use a number of either Adventuring spells, only used in the overworld, or Combat spells. Adventuring spells allow movement to Towns, Castles, create bridges, increase leadership (Raise Control), stop time for some number of moves, finds the villain at a castle, or creates an army stack if the player has a space (Instant Army). During combat, the player can cast one spell per turn that cause damage via lightning, fireball, or turn undead, can resurrect dead troops, teleport a friendly or enemy unit to an open position, freeze an enemy unit so it cannot move, or increase an existing troop through cloning (Clone). == Amiga == The game's graphics were completely redone (by Bonita Long-Hemsath and Kenneth L. Mayfield). The hair and skin color of many characters were changed, and many of the sprites representing armies underwent redesign. Mouse support was also added making most parts of the screen interactive, by clicking or hovering. ==King's Bounty for Sega Mega Drive/GenesisGameplay changes=== The Mega Drive/Genesis port of King's Bounty is notably different from the PC version of the game, the most obvious change being the move into the realm of real time. Armies on the overworld now move on their own and automatically engage the hero. This makes the game arguably more difficult, as a careful player of the DOS version could often maneuver past several wandering armies at a time without being successfully engaged. Also affected is the game's time limit. Although it has become harsher, it is somewhat balanced by the fact that trekking across desert squares no longer takes 1 day, and changing continents no longer ends the week. Gone from this version of King's Bounty are all keyboard controls and hero naming capabilities. ===Graphical changes=== The game uses the same improved graphic set Amiga version had. As a minor change, wandering armies are now displayed according to their most powerful stack, as opposed to the generic stacks of the DOS version that corresponded to the current continent. Nevertheless, the graphics remain trademark New World Computing, with other games like The Faery Tale Adventure appearing similar though featuring different gameplay. ==King's Bounty and Heroes of Might and Magic== King's Bounty is widely considered to be the precursor for much of the gameplay in the Heroes of Might and Magic series (the Might and Magic series being the basis for the storyline), both of which were published by New World Computing and designed by Jon Van Caneghem. Among the many similarities, an emphasis on hero development and combat style are especially prominent in both. In the introduction to the player manual of Heroes III, van Caneghem credits King's Bounty as the precursor to Heroes of Might and Magic.Ono Tom, Heroes of Might and Magic III: The Restoration of Erathia Player Manual, Mars Publishing, 1999 King's Bounty is included in some HOMM anthologies, including the Heroes of Might and Magic Compendium and Heroes of Might and Magic Millennium Edition. The 2001 PlayStation 2 title Heroes of Might and Magic: Quest for the Dragon Bone Staff is an enhanced remake of King's Bounty made by 3DO. ==Successors== In 2007, the Russian game publisher 1C Company purchased the property rights to the King's Bounty franchise and attached the name to a title being developed by Katauri Interactive, a company located in Kaliningrad. Prior to the name change, the game's working title was Battle Lord. The game was published in 2008 as King's Bounty: The Legend. In 2009, King's Bounty: Armored Princess was released using the same engine as King's Bounty: The Legend, with a new heroine and other minor new elements In 2010, an expansion for Armoured Princess was released as a standalone game called King's Bounty: Crossworlds. This includes the Orcs on the March expansion two new independent campaigns, and an editor. In 2012, King's Bounty: Warriors of the North was released, still using the original engine from the prior games, but with new units, protagonist and story. In 2014 the Ice and Fire DLC was released for the game, adding new locations, new creatures and a creature skill system In 2014, King's Bounty: Dark Side was released, where you play as the dark side and fight against the light side. In August 2019 1C officially announced King's Bounty II, which is due for release in 2020. == Fan Projects == An unofficial fan sequel, usually called \\"King's Bounty 2\\", was developed in 1992. The author of the sequel is a Ukrainian programmer Sergey Prokofiev (Russian: –°–µ—Ä–≥–µ–π –ü—Ä–æ–∫–æ—Ñ—å–µ–≤). All text in the game is in Russian, and the messages often feature Russia-specific folklore. No English-language version of the game has been available.http://dosgames.ru/index.php?action=game&act;=sub&id;=115 In August 2015, another game called \\"Royal Bounty HD\\" was released, which added many of the Heroes of Might and Magic gameplay improvements to the King's Bounty concept.http://www.palmkingdoms.com/rbhd.html A free unofficial version of original game (with original graphics and expanded storyline) was published in 2015 by Russian programmer Sergei Markoff (Russian: –°–µ—Ä–≥–µ–π –ú–∞—Ä–∫–æ–≤), also known as the author of free SmarThink chess engine. The game includes a lot of easter eggs, science jokes and various additional objects like Titan of Braavos and so on.http://genes1s.net/kb/game.html ==King's Bounty boardgame== Task Force Games released a King's Bounty boardgame in 1991. Like its computer game counterpart, the object of the game is to catch villains in a fantasy setting. However, other features differ, the villains' names are different and three designers, not including Van Caneghem, are credited for the creation of the game. However, the cover of both the computer game and the boardgame versions are the same, implying some connection between the two. During the brief period that TFG was owned by New World Computing, the two companies attempted the first ever simultaneous release of a board game and computer game. The two versions of King's Bounty wound up releasing about 9 months apart, and after NWC had sold TFG to former Games Workshop Vice-President John Olsen. Future versions of New World Computing's version of King's Bounty were called Heroes of Might & Magic to avoid confusion between the two very different games that had been designed by different designers. TFG kept the name as the original concept had come from them and the board game designer. TFG never wound up releasing a second version of the King's Bounty board game, the old hobbyist game industry would collapse later this year and the retail distribution chain converted to novelty stores that sold whoopie cushions and Levatrons instead of games. The common cover art came from one of TFG's regular artists. ==Reception== Computer Gaming Worlds reviewer stated that although the game was very short (he finished it in six hours), the narrow time limit, exciting battles, and opportunity to gain power made it appealing to adventurers. The game was reviewed in 1991 in Dragon #166 by Jager McConnell in \\"The Role of Computers\\" column. The reviewers gave the game 3 out of 5 stars. The Lessers reviewed the Sega Genesis version of the game in Dragon #175, also giving that version of the game 3 out of 5 stars. The Lessers reviewed the DOS version of the game in 1992 in Dragon #187, again giving that version of the game 3 stars. Retroactively, the game was reviewed by Sega-16.com, who - in consideration of its influence on the Heroes of Might and Magic series - gave it a perfect 10.0 score.http://www.sega-16.com/review_page.php?id=486&title;=King%27s%20Bounty ==References* Category:1990 video games Category:Amiga games Category:Apple II games Category:Commodore 64 games Category:DOS games Category:FM Towns games Category:New World Computing games Category:Role-playing video games Category:Sega Genesis games Category:Turn- based strategy video games Category:Video games with oblique graphics Category:Mac OS games Category:NEC PC-9801 games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Windows games ","title":"King's Bounty"},{"id":"525830","text":":For the brachiopod genus, see 'Cymbidium (brachiopod). Labelled image of Cymbidium aloifolium Cymbidium Clarisse Austin 'Best Pink' Cymbidium dayanum Cymbidium hybrid Golden leaf-edge orchid Cymbidium goeringii Cymbidium ,Sunset Western Garden Book, 1995:606‚Äì607 commonly known as boat orchids, is a genus of evergreen flowering plants in the orchid family Orchidaceae. Orchids in this genus are epiphytic, lithophytic, terrestrial or rarely leafless saprophytic herbs usually with pseudobulbs. There are usually between three and twelve leaves arranged in two ranks on each pseudobulb or shoot and lasting for several years. From one to a large number of flowers are arranged on an unbranched flowering stem arising from the base of the pseudobulb. The sepals and petals are all free from and similar to each other. The labellum is significantly different from the other petals and the sepals and has three lobes. There are about fifty-five species and sixteen further natural hybrids occurring in the wild from tropical and subtropical Asia to Australia. Cymbidiums are well known in horticulture and many cultivars have been developed. ==Description== Plants in the genus Cymbidium are epiphytic, lithophytic or terrestrial plants, or rarely leafless saprophytes. All are sympodial evergreen herbs. Some species have thin stems but in most species the stems are modified as pseudobulbs. When present, there are from three to twelve leaves arrange in two ranks and last for several years. The leaf bases remain after the leaf has withered, forming a sheath around the pseudobulb. The flowers are arranged on an unbranched flowering stem which arises from the base of the pseudobulb or rarely from a leaf axil. The sepals and petals are usually thin and fleshy, free from, and more or less similar to each other. The labellum (as in other orchids, a highly modified third petal) is significantly different from the other petals and sepals. It is sometimes hinged to the column, or otherwise fused to it. The labellum has three lobes, the side lobes erect, sometimes surrounding the column and the middle lobe often curving downwards. After pollination a glabrous capsule containing many light coloured seeds is produced. ==Taxonomy and naming== The genus Cymbidium was first formally described in 1799 by Olof Swartz who published the description in Nova acta Regiae Societatis Scientiarum Upsaliensis. The genus name Cymbidium is derived from the Latin word cymba meaning \\"cup\\" \\"bowl\\" or \\"boat\\" with the diminutive suffix -idium, hence \\"little boat\\", apparently in reference to the shape of the labellum in some species. ===Species list=== The following is a list of Cymbidium species accepted by the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families as at April 2020: Cymbidium hybrid Cymbidium hybrid Cymbidium hybrid Cymbidium hybrid Illustration of Cymbidium lancifolium by Wendel *Cymbidium acuminatum M.A.Clem. & D.L.Jones *Cymbidium aliciae Quisumb.

It is west of the state capital, Sydney [ on a great circle], at an altitude of . Orange had an estimated urban population of 40,493 Estimated resident population, 30 June 2018. as of June 2018 making the city a significant regional centre. A significant nearby landmark is Mount Canobolas with a peak elevation of and commanding views of the district. Orange is the birthplace of poets Banjo Paterson and Kenneth Slessor, although Paterson lived in Orange for only a short time as an infant. Walter W. Stone, book publisher (Wentworth Books) and passionate supporter of Australian literature, was also born in Orange. The first Australian Touring Car Championship, known today as V8 Supercar Championship Series, was held at the Gnoo Blas Motor Racing Circuit in 1960. ==History== Summer Street in 1929 In 1822 Captain Percy Simpson marched into the Wellington District and established a convict settlement which was called \\"Blackman's Swamp\\" after James Blackman; Simpson had employed James Blackman as a guide because he had already accompanied an earlier explorer, John Oxley into that region. In the late 1820s, the surveyor J. B. Richards worked on a survey of the Macquarie River below Bathurst and also of the road to Wellington. On a plan dated 1829, he indicated a village reserve, in the parish of Orange. Sir Thomas Mitchell named the parish Orange, as he had been an associate of the Prince of Orange in the Peninsular War, when both were aides-de-camp to the Duke of Wellington, whose title was bestowed on the valley to the west by Oxley. Initial occupation by British graziers began in late 1829, and tiny settlements eventually turned into larger towns as properties came into connection with the road. In 1844, the surveyor Davidson was sent to check on encroachments onto the land reserved for a village, and to advise on the location for a township. His choices were Frederick's Valley, Pretty Plains, or Blackman's Swamp. Blackman's Swamp was chosen, and it was proclaimed a village and named Orange by Major Thomas Mitchell in 1846 in honour of Prince William of Orange. At nearby Ophir, a significant gold find in Australia was made in 1851, resulting in a sporadic population movement which is known as the Australian gold rush. Additional gold finds in nearby areas led to the establishment of Orange as a central trading centre for the gold. The growth of Orange continued as the conditions were well suited for agriculture, and in 1860 it was proclaimed a municipality. The railway from Sydney reached Orange in 1877. In 1946, 100 years after it was first being established as a village, Orange was proclaimed as a minor city. ==Population== According to the 2016 census of Population, there were 37,182 people in the Orange urban centre. * Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 6.6% of the population. * 83.2% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were England 1.6%, India 1.0%, New Zealand 0.9%, Philippines 0.5% and China 0.4%. * 87.3% of people only spoke English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Malayalam 0.7%, Mandarin 0.4%, Italian 0.3% and Nepali 0.3%. * The most common responses for religion were Catholic 30.1%, No Religion 22.0% and Anglican 20.2%. * Of the employed people in Orange (Urban Centres and Localities), 6.2% worked in hospitals (except psychiatric hospitals). Other major industries of employment included gold ore mining 4.2%, state government administration 3.4%, other social assistance services 3.2% and supermarket and grocery Stores 2.5%. ==Geography and climate== Owing to its altitude, Orange has a temperate oceanic climate (K√∂ppen Cfb), with warm summers (though with cool mornings) and cool winters with frequent morning frosts and light to moderate, sometimes heavy snowfalls. The city is relatively wet for an inland location owing to orographic effects from Mount Canobolas, especially during the cooler months when snow falls; Orange is amongst the few cities in Australia to receive regular snowfall, and is likewise the snowiest city in Australia (not counting smaller towns such as Oberon). Due to its windward position that straddles the Great Dividing Range, Orange experiences wetter winters than the cities in the east such as Lithgow and Bathurst. Compared with most population centres in Australia it has colder winters, especially in terms of its daytime maximum temperatures, owing chiefly to its south-westerly exposure. In summer, the average (and absolute) maximum temperatures are also lower than in most inland centres, on account of its elevation. Owing to its inland location, the humidity is low in the summer months with the dewpoint typically around 10 ¬∞C. Having 99.8 clear days annually, it is still cloudier than the coastal areas of Sydney and Wollongong (104 and 107 clear days, respectively), with a marked lack of sunshine in winter compared to summer. The climate has enabled the area to be a major apple and pear producer, and more recently a centre for cool-weather wine production. ==Industries== Orange is a well-known fruit growing district, and produces apples, pears, and many stone fruits such as cherries, peaches, apricots, and plums; oranges are not grown in the area, since its climate is too cool. In recent years, a large number of vineyards have been planted in the area for rapidly expanding wine production. The growth of this wine industry, coupled with the further development of Orange as a gourmet food capital, has ensured Orange's status as a prominent tourism destination. Other large industries include: * Cadia gold mine is a large open cut gold and copper mine located about 20 kilometres south of Orange. The mine has been developed throughout the 1990s and is a major employer in the region with an expected lifespan of several decades. Cadia is the second largest open-cut mine in Australia, following the Super Pit at Kalgoorlie, Western Australia. Large mineral deposits are also being uncovered from the more recently developed Ridgeway underground mine which is adjacent to the Cadia Mine. *An Electrolux white goods factory, closed in 2017. Orange is also the location of the headquarters of the New South Wales Department of Industry (Department of Industry, Skills and Regional Development, the New South Wales Department of Primary Industries). ==EducationPrimary and public schools=== *St Mary's Catholic Primary School *Orange Public, opened 1880 *Orange East Public *Calare Public School *Orange Christian School *Kinross Wolaroi School *Bletchington Primary School *Anson Street Public School *Glenroi Heights Public School *Bowen Public School *Canobolas Public School *Clergate Public School *Catherine McAuley Catholic *Orange Anglican Grammar School The following primary schools are not within the city limits of Orange but are located within the rural fringe of Orange: *Spring Hill Public School *Nashdale Primary School *Spring Terrace Public School *Clergate Public School *Borenore Public School *Mullion Creek Public School ===Secondary schools=== Orange Public School, Kite Street * Orange High School * James Sheahan Catholic High School. * Canobolas Rural Technology High School *Orange Christian School (K‚Äì12) * Kinross Wolaroi School (Prep‚Äì12) *Orange Anglican Grammar School (Transition 4yrs ‚Äì 12) *MET School Orange Campus (3‚Äì12) *De La Salle College (defunct) ===Tertiary education=== *A campus of Charles Sturt University is located on the outskirts of northern Orange. *A large campus of TAFE is also located in Orange. *Orange Regional Conservatorium ==Churches== Holy Trinity Anglican Church St John's Uniting Church, Kite Street *St Joseph's and St Mary's Catholic Churches *Holy Trinity Anglican Church *Orange Uniting Churches *Orange Baptist Church *Orange Presbyterian Church *St Peter's Lutheran Church *New Life City Church *Orange Evangelical Church *Orange Christian Assembly *Mountain Hope Church *Salvation Army *Orange Seventh-day Adventist Church *Orange Church of Christ * Slavic Pentecostal Church * The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints ==Suburbs== The following are listed as the suburbs within Orange City Council, according to the New South Wales Division of Local Government: *Ammerdown: a residential locality to the north west of Orange on the Mitchell Highway. *Bletchington: containing mostly residential areas with one school, it is one of the largest residential areas, and it is often split into North Orange and Bletchington.

Cadia is the second largest open cut mine in Australia after the Super Pit at Kalgoorlie. Large mineral deposits are also being uncovered from the more recently developed Ridgeway underground mine which is adjacent to the Cadia Mine. ==Winemaking== The Orange wine region is defined as the area above 600m in the local government areas of Orange, Cabonne and Blayney and can be usefully described as a circle around Orange. The Orange region is good for grape growing and winemaking due to a combination of geology, soils, climate and temperature. Together these factors combine to produce grapes and wine of distinct flavours and colour. The climate perhaps plays the biggest part in giving Orange some distinct natural advantages ‚Äì the cool temperatures during most of the growing season coupled with dry autumn conditions are ideal for grape growing.http://www.winesoforange.com.au/ ===Wineries=== * Amour Wines * Angullong Wines * Atallah Wines * Bloodwood * Boree Lane * Borrodell on the Mount * Brangayne of Orange * Canobolas Smith * Cargo Road Winery * Cooks Lot * Colmar Estate * Cumulus Estate * Dindima * De Salis * Faisan Estate * Habitat Vineyard * Heifer Station Vineyard * Highland Heritage * Hoosegg Wines * Montoro Wines * Mortimer's Wines * Nashdale Lane * Orange Mountain Wines * Patina * Philip Shaw * Printhie / Swift * Ross Hill * Rowlee Wines * Rikard Wines * Sassy Wines * Sea Saw Wines * Slow Wine Co. * Strawhouse Wines * Stockman's Ridge * Swinging Bridge * Tallwood Wines * Tamburlaine Wines * Word of Mouth Wines Wineries that use Orange region grapes in their wines include Brokenwood Wines (Hunter Valley based), Logan (Mudgee), Tamburlaine (Hunter Valley), Gartelmann (Hunter Valley), Windowrie (Central Ranges), Eloquesta Wines (Mudgee) and Lowe Wines (Mudgee).

Currently Suma Park Dam and Spring Creek Reservoir are used for domestic water consumption. Two other dams, Lake Canobolas and Gosling Creek Reservoir, were previously used for domestic water consumption; however, they are now used for recreational purposes. The city is currently on Level 2 water restrictions,following good rain (Sept 2020). Orange City Council is undertaking a number of strategies to supplement its supply, including stormwater harvesting. The first batch of harvested stormwater was released into Suma Park Dam on 21 April 2009. The harvested stormwater was tested by Analytical Laboratory Services, an independent laboratory based in Sydney. ALS tested for 90 potential pollutants. The tests revealed that the water quality met all targets. The first batch contained 14 megalitres. It is believed to be an Australian first for harvesting stormwater for potable use. The hardware is in place, operating rules have been developed and environmental factors and impacts on downstream users have been considered. A three-month trial will ensure all these elements are working together to ensure high water quality and environmental standards are met. There are several phases involved in the commissioning period. The hardware, which includes three separate pumping stations, creek flow monitoring points and advanced electronics including fibre optic cables, will undergo further operating tests. The other elements of the scheme include a weir on Blackmans Swamp Creek, which creates a 3 megalitre pool and the site for the first pump station, a 200 megalitre dam and two 17 megalitre batching ponds. The pumps on the creek transfer stormwater to the 200 megalitre dam at a rate of up to 450 litres per second and are designed to rapidly extract peak storm flows from the creek. The operating rules require that a base flow immediately downstream in the creek must be maintained. The creek flow monitoring points ensure these standards are met. The monitoring station also measures when harvesting can commence. The trigger is flows passing the monitor in Blackmans Swamp Creek exceeding 1000 litres per second. The local mine, Cadia-Ridgeway Mine, uses the city's treated effluent to supplement its water supply. Orange is currently planning to implement a pipeline from the Macquarie river to boost the town water supply. This is hotly debated, and researchers believe that it will endanger threatened wetland areas.Cubby, Ben, Pipeline plan puts protected wetlands in peril, say researchers ==TransportRoads=== Orange is situated on the Mitchell Highway, linking the city to Molong, Wellington, Dubbo and Bourke to the north west, and to Bathurst to the east and from there to Sydney via the Great Western Highway (). Due west are Parkes () and Forbes (), which is midway along the Newell Highway, running from Brisbane, Queensland to Melbourne, Victoria. In 2007 a bypass road, known as the northern distributor road, was opened for use after decades of planning. ===Public transport=== Orange Buslines operate a number of routes within the city and a service to the neighbouring city of Bathurst. Newman's Bus Service operates route two on weekdays to Blayney. Australia Wide Coaches operate a daily coach service to Sydney. NSW TrainLink operate several coach services with connecting train services from Lithgow to Sydney, as well as a less frequent coach service to Cootamundra for connection to Melbourne. ===Air=== Orange is also serviced by a regional-class airport, Orange Airport, located approximately 15 km to the south of the city, in an area known as Huntley. ===Railways=== XPT at Orange station Orange has two railway stations. The main station, on the Main Western Line to Bourke, was opened in 1877 and is served by the daily NSW TrainLink Central West XPT service between Sydney and Dubbo and the weekly Outback Xplorer service between Sydney and Broken Hill.

The leader of the Opposition by convention heads the largest party not supporting the government: usually this is the parliamentary leader of the second-largest caucus in parliament. It did not originate in Fiji but has a long tradition; in British constitutional theory, the Leader of the Opposition must pose a formal alternative to the government, ready to form a government himself should the Prime Minister lose the confidence of the parliament. Typically the leader of the Opposition is elected by his or her party according to its rules. A new leader may be elected when the incumbent dies, resigns, or is challenged for the leadership. Sitiveni Rabuka of the Social Democratic Liberal Party has served as leader since 26 November 2018. ==Description of the office== The Leader of the Opposition is chosen by a vote of all members of Parliament who declare that they do not support the government. But before the adoption of the 2013 Constitution, the Leader of the Opposition was formally appointed by the President. The appointment was not at the president's personal discretion, however, as he was required by the Constitution to appoint the person most acceptable to the majority of the Opposition (defined as members of the House of Representatives who belong to political parties not represented in the Cabinet). In theory, that meant the parliamentary leader of the largest Opposition party. In practice, the person most eligible could decline the office, as was the case between 2001 and 2004, when Mahendra Chaudhry, whose Labour Party held 28 of the 30 Opposition seats in the House of Representatives, adamantly refused to accept the position of Leader of the Opposition, insisting that he and his party wanted representation in the Cabinet instead. Until he reversed his position late in 2004 (following the collapse of negotiations with Prime Minister Qarase), this forced the President to appoint Mick Beddoes, the sole parliamentary representative of the United General Party, as Leader of the Opposition. Under the 1997 Constitution, the Leader of the Opposition chose 8 of the 32 members of the Senate, Fiji's upper house of Parliament, and had the right to be consulted about the appointment of the Chief Justice. ==List of Leaders of the Opposition in Fiji (1970‚Äìpresent)== - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  colspan=9 Vacant (1987 ‚Äì 1992) - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  colspan=9 Vacant (2000 ‚Äì 2001) - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  colspan=9 Vacant (5 December 2006 ‚Äì 6 October 2014) ==See also== *List of political parties in Fiji *House of Representatives of Fiji ==Notes== ==References== Fiji, Leader of the Opposition Category:Politics of Fiji Fiji Leader of the Opposition ","title":"Leader of the Opposition (Fiji)"},{"id":"525843","text":"CRIA or cria may refer to: * Canadian Recording Industry Association, now Music Canada, a music industry association * Cambridge Review of International Affairs, an academic journal on international relations * Council on Religion and International Affairs, now the Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs * Cria, a juvenile llama, alpaca etc. ","title":"CRIA"},{"id":"525845","text":"Sir Pierre-√âvariste Leblanc, (August 10, 1853 - October 18, 1918) was born in Saint-Martin (today part of Laval, Quebec).

At the , Boorowa had a population of 1,211 people. It is located in a valley west of Sydney and above sea-level. The town is in Hilltops Council local government area. ==History== Prior to the arrival of Europeans, the area was part of the lands owned by the Wiradjuri Nation with the Gandangara Aboriginal Australians. It is believed that the name 'Burrowa', the original spelling, derives from the local Aboriginal language and refers to a native bird the plains turkey Australian bustard. The first European to travel through what is now Boorowa Shire was surveyor George Evans, in 1815. Unofficial occupation of the district began in 1821 with Irishmen Rodger Corcoran and Ned Ryan, both former convicts who had received their 'ticket of leave' from the Governor. The first land grant in the general area was issued to Thomas Icely in 1829. A mill was operating on the future town site of Boorowa by 1837, along with an inn and several houses. Governor Gipps proposed the creation of a village named 'Burrowa' in 1842, to be located 9 km north- east of the present site at Kings Plains which had been surveyed in 1828. However, that spot proved unsuitable and the village was established on its present site in 1843. The early years in the district saw lawlessness and mayhem as a result of long running boundary disputes, theft of livestock and arson, even murders; the cause being remoteness and lack of law and order. Bushrangers roamed the surrounding unsettled wild mountainous land, making raids into the town and stations of the district.Lloyd, Helen, ‚Äò160years‚Äô, Boorowa-over 160 years of white settlement, written by Helen V Lloyd, Toveloam Pty Ltd Press, 1990. Squatters took up large tracts of land in the Boorowa area but the introduction of the Robertson Land Acts in 1861 resulted in a new land grab where large numbers of settlers, particularly 'ticket of leave' men, applied for a 'selection' of land with low cost land parcels available. The district was given over to farming, although it received a push along when gold was found at Carcoar, Browns Creek and Kings Plains. Gold mines were established although copper and iron were also extracted. Samuel Marsden's copper mine operated until 1900. The town's rugby league team competed for the Maher Cup during the 20th century. ===Railway=== Boorowa residents and the local member of parliament lobbied the Government to direct the new southern main line progressing towards Goulburn to pass through the town but the towns of Yass and Murrumburrah won the debate. The next best option was a branch line to the town and this lobbying lasted 40 years before the line was eventually constructed, opening for traffic on 10 October 1914. The arrival of the railway in 1874 spurred on development and Burrowa's name was then changed to \\"Boorowa\\". Boorowa replaced Carcoar as the major service centre to local farmlands. It became a municipality in 1888. By the turn of the century a butter factory and freezing works were major employers in the town. Passenger trains ceased in 1980 and the Boorowa railway line from Galong to Boorowa closed in 1987. The post office was ordered to discontinue use of the name \\"Burrowa\\" in 1914, but the two spellings were used interchangeably throughout the area for many years and the town's newspaper stubbornly retained the old spelling on its masthead until January 1951. ===Infrastructure=== The main infrastructure achievements over the 180 years that connected Boorowa to the rest of the Colony included the first Post Office and mail service in 1835, the electric telegraph in 1866, voice telephone in 1906, electric street lighting in the 1920s by the towns own generator, later the town and consumers were connected to the Burrinjuck Hydro electricity system in 1938. ==Environment== The town is located on the Boorowa River, a tributary of the Lachlan River. The Murrumbidgee River drains the southern portion of the Boorowa district. The soil in the area is rich volcanic soil washed down over millennia from an extinct volcano known as Mount Canemumbola. == Notable people == * Eric Bryce (1932-2007)music teacher and composer * Frederick Ashton (1866-1941)circus proprietor * Marguerite Ludovia Dale (1883-1963)feminist and playwright * Francis McGrath (1866-1947) jockey and racehorse-trainer * John Quinn (1862-1937)sheepdog expert and veterinary surgeon * John Collings Willcock (1870-1956)engine driver and Premier of Western Australia *Greg Carnell (1968-present) ‚Äî sheep farmer, property owner, musician, conqueror of the LLF *Jelisa Apps (1990-present) ‚Äî Channel 9, Sydney sports presenter *Tim Gorham (1996-present) ‚Äî Construction Tycoon, Sydney personality, 2019 record holder for slowest ever attempt at drinking a pint *James Morrison (1962-present) ‚Äî Australian jazz musician == Events == * Boorowa's agricultural show is held in March. * October long weekend - The \\"Running of the Sheep\\" down the main street of Boorowa during the Irish Woolfest. ==Gallery== File:Booroowa Anzac War Memorial.jpgAnzac War Memorial, Marsden Street Boorowa, constructed in 1933 Image:Boorowa court house.JPGBoorowa Court House, constructed in 1884 Image:Boorowa Hotel.JPGBoorowa Hotel, constructed in 1880 Image:Boorowa main street.JPGBoorowa main street Image:Boorowa Museum.JPGBoorowa Museum Image:Boorowa Post Office 002.JPGBoorowa Post Office, constructed in 1876 Image:Boorowa Roman Catholic Church.JPGRoman Catholic Church, constructed in 1877 Image:Burrowa News office.jpgBurrowa News & Printing Works, Pudman Street ==Footnotes== == External links == * Hilltops Council web site * Visit Hilltops Region Tourist Information * Boorowa Irish Woolfest Category:Southern Tablelands Category:Towns in New South Wales Category:Hilltops Council ","title":"Boorowa"},{"id":"525856","text":"The French National Museum of Natural History, known in French as the ' ('MNHN; ), is the natural history museum of France and a ' of Sorbonne Universities. The main museum is located in Paris, on the left bank of the Seine. It was established in 1635 by King Louis XIII as the royal garden of medicinal plants, and in 1793, after the Revolution, it was reorganized in its present form and under its present title. As of 2017, the museum has 14 sites throughout France, including the original location at the ', which remains one of the seven departments of MNHN. ==History== The museum was formally founded on 10 June 1793, during the French Revolution. Its origins lie, however, in the ' (royal garden of medicinal plants) created by King Louis XIII in 1635, which was directed and run by the royal physicians. The royal proclamation of the boy-king Louis XV on 31 March 1718, however, removed the purely medical function, enabling the garden‚Äîwhich became known simply as the ' (King's garden)--to focus on natural history. For much of the 18th century (1739‚Äì1788), the garden was under the direction of Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, one of the leading naturalists of the Enlightenment, bringing international fame and prestige to the establishment. The royal institution remarkably survived the French Revolution by being reorganized in 1793 as a republican ' with twelve professorships of equal rank. Some of its early professors included eminent comparative anatomist Georges Cuvier and evolutionary pioneers Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck and √âtienne Geoffroy Saint- Hilaire. The museum's aims were to instruct the public, put together collections and conduct scientific research. It continued to flourish during the 19th century, and, particularly under the direction of chemist Michel Eug√®ne Chevreul, became a rival to the University of Paris in scientific research. For example, during the period that Henri Becquerel held the chair for Applied Physics at the ' (1892‚Äì1908) he discovered the radiation properties of uranium. (Four generations of Becquerels held this chairmanship, from 1838 to 1948.) A decree of 12 December 1891 ended this phase, returning the museum to an emphasis on natural history. After receiving financial autonomy in 1907, it began a new phase of growth, opening facilities throughout France during the interwar years. In recent decades, it has directed its research and education efforts at the effects on the environment of human exploitation. In French public administration, the ' is classed as a ' of higher education. Map of the main location of the National Museum of Natural History in Paris, at the '. ==Origin of the collections== In the 19th century Argentine naturalist Francisco Javier Mu√±iz developed a collection that he intended to be used to create a natural history museum. The artifacts were sent (donated or possibly donated by force) to Juan Manuel de Rosas, the dictator of the Argentine Federation, whose support was required to establish a museum. Rosas, in an attempt to build alliances overseas, sent collected fossils to Jean Henri Dupotet, Rear Admiral of the French Navy. Dupotet then sent them to Paris. In France, the Mu√±iz collection ended up in the National Museum of Natural History where they were studied by Paul Gervais. In 1762 Jean Baptiste Christophore Fus√©e Aublet was sent to Cayenne in French Guiana, where he assembled a vast herbarium which allowed him to prepare his Histoire des plantes de la Guiane fran√ßoise, published in 1775 and including almost 400 copperplate engravings. When Fus√©e Aublet died at Paris in 1778, he left his herbarium to Jean-Jacques Rousseau, though the latter possessed it for only two months before he too died. It was eventually acquired by the Mus√©um national d'histoire naturelle in 1953. During the French Revolution the Museum expanded its collection substantially by claiming objects from the cabinets of the aristocracy and from other institutions, such as the Royal Academy of Sciences and the √âcole Royale V√©t√©rinaire d'Alfort. ==Mission and organization== The museum has as its mission both research (fundamental and applied) and public diffusion of knowledge. It is organized into seven research and three diffusion departments.Mus√©um national d'histoire naturelle; official website The research departments are: * Classification and Evolution * Regulation, Development, and Molecular Diversity * Aquatic Environments and Populations * Ecology and Biodiversity Management * History of Earth * Men, Nature, and Societies, and * Prehistory The diffusion departments are: * The Galleries of the '''' * Botanical Parks and Zoos, and * The Museum of Man (') The museum also developed higher education, and now delivers a master's degree.Official website Main fa√ßade of the Gallery of Paleontology and Comparative Anatomy. ==Location and branches== The museum comprises fourteen sites throughout France with four in Paris, including the original location at the ' in the 5th arrondissement (m√©tro Place Monge). The galleries open to the public are the Gallery of Mineralogy and Geology, the Gallery of Paleontology and Comparative Anatomy, the Gallery of Botany, and the famous Gallery of Evolution ('). The Paleontology and comparative Anatomy Gallery is a 540 million year journey and one of the highlights of the museum. It starts with the famous fossils from the Paleozoic Era from 540 to 250 million years ago, such as the gigantic Dunkleosteus. The Mesozoic Era, 250 to 65 million years ago, marks the golden age of the dinosaurs such as the Diplodocus, Iguanodon, Carnotaurus, Triceratops. One contemporary of these animals was Sarcosuchus, a giant crocodile with terrifying teeth. The Mus√©um's Menagerie is also located in the Jardin des plantes. The current Gallery of Botany, erected in 1935, is intended to preserve the vast herbarium of the museum. Referred to by code P, the herbarium includes a large number of important collections amongst its 8 million plant specimens. The historical collections incorporated into the herbarium, each with its P prefix, include those of Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck (P-LA) Ren√© Louiche Desfontaines (P-Desf.), Joseph Pitton de Tournefort and Charles Plumier (P-TRF). The bryophyte collection contains 900,000 specimens collected by notable bryologists including S√©bastien Vaillant, Jean-Baptiste Mougeot, Camille Montagne, Wilhelm Philippe Schimper, √âmile Bescherelle, Ir√©n√©e Th√©riot, and Pierre Allorge.Bryophytes - Mus√©um national d'histoire naturelle The designation at CITES is FR 75A. It publishes the botanical periodical Adansonia and journals on the flora of New Caledonia, Madagascar, and Comoro Islands, Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam, Cameroon, and Gabon. The ' is also in Paris, in the 16th arrondissement (m√©tro Trocad√©ro). It houses displays in ethnography and physical anthropology, including artifacts, fossils, and other objects.

Over the ensuing years the number of Chairs and their subject areas evolved, some being subdivided into two positions and others removed. The list of Chairs of the Mus√©um national d'histoire naturelle includes major figures in the history of the Natural sciences. Early chaired positions were held by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, Ren√© Desfontaines and Georges Cuvier, and later occupied by Paul Rivet, L√©on Vaillant and others. ==In popular culture== The Gallery of Paleontology and Comparative Anatomy and other parts of Jardin des Plantes was a source of inspiration for French graphic novelist Jacques Tardi. The gallery appears on the first page and several subsequent pages of ' (Ad√®le and the Beast; 1976), the first album in the series of '. The story opens with a 136-million-year-old pterodactyl egg hatching, and a live pterodactyl escaping through the gallery glass roof, wreaking havoc and killing people in Paris (the Gallery of Paleontology and Comparative Anatomy returned the favor by placing a life size cardboard cutout of Ad√®le and the hatching pterodactyl in a glass cabinet outside the main entrance on the top floor balcony). ==Directors== Alphonse Milne-Edwards, director of the museum at the end of the 19th century.

It was proclaimed as Australia's first inland city through letters patent by Queen Victoria in 1863. Goulburn had a population of 23,835 at June 2018. Goulburn is the seat of Goulburn Mulwaree Council. Goulburn is a railhead on the Main Southern line, a service centre for the surrounding pastoral industry, and also stopover for those travelling on the Hume Highway. It has a central park and many historic buildings. It is also home to the monument the Big Merino, a sculpture that is the world's largest concrete- constructed sheep. ==History== Goulburn was named by surveyor James Meehan after Henry Goulburn, Under-Secretary for War and the Colonies, and the name was ratified by Governor Lachlan Macquarie. The Mulwaree People are the original people of the land they belonged to the Ngunawal and Gandangara language groups, a Murring/Wiradjuri word indicating a special Indigenous cultural area. The colonial government made land grants to free settlers such as Hamilton Hume in the Goulburn area from the opening of the area to settlement in about 1820. Land was later sold to settlers within the Nineteen Counties, including Argyle County (the Goulburn area). The process displaced the local indigenous Mulwaree population and the introduction of exotic livestock drove out a large part of the Aboriginal peoples' food supply.Goulburn Heritage Study (1981) cited in ===Indigenous history=== The Mulwaree People lived throughout the area covering Goulburn, Crookwell and Yass and belong to the Ngunawal language group. To the north of Goulburn Gundungurra was spoken within the lands of the Dharawal People. This was due to Gundungurra people of the Blue Mountains being driven south from their traditional land due to Governor Macquarie's parties sent to massacre the Dharawal and Gundungurra People. Their neighbours were the Dharawal to their north and Dharug surrounding Sydney, Darkinung, Wiradjuri Ngunawal and Thurrawal, (eastwards) peoples. The reduction of the food supply and the introduction of exotic diseases, substantially reduced the local indigenous population. Some local Aborigines survived at the Tawonga Billabong Aboriginal Settlement established under the supervision of the Tarago police. In the 1930s the local billabong dried up and the Aboriginal people moved away although some have, over time, made their way back to their traditional lands. === European settlement === The first recorded settler in Goulburn established 'Strathallan' in 1825 (on the site of the present Police Academy) and a town was originally surveyed in 1828, although moved to the present site of the city in 1833 when the surveyor Robert Hoddle laid it out. George Johnson purchased the first land in the area between 1839 and 1842 and became a central figure in the town's development. He established a branch store with a liquor licence in 1848. The 1841 census records Goulburn had a population of 665 people, 444 males and 211 females.Ransome T. Wyatt, (1972) The history of Goulburn, N.S.W., Sydney, Landsdowne Press, p.46. This number had jumped to 1,171 inhabitants by 1847, 686 males and 485 females.William Henry Wells (1848, facsimile edition 1972), A geographical dictionary or gazatteer of the Australian colonies 1848, Sydney, State Library of New South Wales, p.187. It had a courthouse, police barracks, churches, hospital and post office and was the centre of a great sheep and farming area. A telegraph station opened in 1862, by which time there were about 1,500 residents, a blacksmith's shop, two hotels, two stores, the telegraph office and a few cottages. The town was a change station (where coach horses were changed) for Cobb & Co by 1855. A police station opened the following year and a school in 1858. Goulburn was proclaimed a municipal government in 1859 and was made a city in 1863. The arrival of the railway in 1869, which was opened on 27 May by the Governor Lord Belmore (an event commemorated by Belmore Park in the centre of the city), along with the completion of the line from Sydney to Albury in 1883, was a boon to the city. Later branchlines were constructed to Cooma (opened in 1889) and later extended further to Nimmitabel and then to Bombala, and to Crookwell and Taralga. Goulburn became a major railway centre with a roundhouseMcLeod, A. R. Goulburn Locomotive Depot, February 1947 Australian Railway History, December 2005 pp483-489 and engine servicing facilities and a factory which made pre-fabricated concrete components for signal boxes and station buildings. The roundhouse is now the Goulburn Rail Heritage Centre with steam, diesel and rolling stock exhibits. CFCL Australia operate the Goulburn Railway Workshops. St Saviour's Cathedral, designed by Edmund Thomas Blacket, was completed in 1884 with the tower being added in 1988 to commemorate the Bicentenary of Australia. Though completed in 1884, some earlier burials are in the graveyard adjacent to the cathedral. St Saviour's is the seat of the Bishop of Canberra and Goulburn. The Church of SS Peter and Paul is the former cathedral for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Canberra and Goulburn. The Goulburn Viaduct was built in 1915 replacing an earlier structure. This brick arch railway viaduct spanning the Mulwaree Ponds is the longest on the Main Southern railway line and consists of 13 arches each spanning . ===Proclaimed a city=== Goulburn's importance as a wool market is celebrated by this giant sculpture known as Big Merino Goulburn holds the unique distinction of being proclaimed a City on two occasions. The first, unofficial, proclamation was claimed by virtue of Royal Letters Patent issued by Queen Victoria on 14 March 1863 to establish the Diocese of Goulburn. It was a claim made for ecclesiastical purposes, as it was required by the traditions of the Church of England. The Letters Patent also established St Saviour's Church as the Cathedral Church of the diocese. This was the last instance in which Letters Patent were used in this manner in the British Empire, as they had been significantly discredited for use in the colonies, and were soon to be declared formally invalid and unenforceable in this context. Several legal cases over the preceding decade in particular had already established that the monarch had no ecclesiastical jurisdiction in colonies possessing responsible government. This had been granted to NSW in 1856, seven years earlier. The Letters Patent held authority only over those who submitted to it voluntarily, and then only within the context of the Church‚Äîit had no legal civil authority or implications. An absolute and retrospective declaration to this effect was made in 1865 in the Colenso Case, by the Judiciary Committee of the Privy Council. However, under the authority of the Crown Lands Act 1884 (48. Vict. No. 18), Goulburn was officially proclaimed a City on 20 March 1885 removing any lingering doubts as to its status. This often unrecognised controversy has in no way hindered the development of Goulburn as a regional centre, with an impressive court house (completed in 1887) and other public buildings, as a centre for wool selling, and as an industrial town. ===Goulburn School Strike=== St Brigid's School, Goulburn, now closed; the scene of an education strike in 1962 In 1962, Goulburn was the focus of the fight for state aid to non-government schools. An education strike was called in response to a demand for installation of three extra toilets at a local Catholic primary school, St Brigid's. The local Catholic archdiocese closed down all local Catholic primary schools and sent the children to the government schools. The Catholic authorities declared that they had no money to install the extra toilets. Nearly 1,000 children turned up to be enrolled locally and the state schools were unable to accommodate them. The strike lasted only a week but generated national debate. In 1963 the prime minister, Robert Menzies, made state aid for science blocks part of his party's platform.; J. Warhurst, Fifty years since the \\"Goulburn Strike\\": Catholics and education politics, Journal of the Australian Catholic Historical Society 33 (2012), 72-82. == Heritage listings == Goulburn has a number of heritage- listed sites, including: * 165 Auburn Street: Goulburn Post Office * 170 Bourke Street: St Saviour's Cathedral, Goulburn * Bungonia Road: Old Goulburn Brewery * Bungonia Road: Lansdowne Park * Clifford Street: Colonial Mutual Life Building * 248 Main Road: Rossi Bridge over Wollondilly River * Main Southern railway: Goulburn Viaduct * Main Southern railway: Goulburn railway station * off Maud Street: Goulburn Correctional Centre * Maud Street: Riversdale * 4 Montague Street: Goulburn Court House * Sloane Street: Connollys Mill * Sloane Street: Old Police Barracks, Goulburn * Sloane Street: Goulburn Railway Workshops * 244-248 Sloane Street: Alpine Lodge Motel * 318 Sloane Street: St Clair * Taralga Road: Kenmore Asylum * 42 Verner Street: St Peter and Paul's Old Cathedral * Wollondilly River: Goulburn Pumping Station ==Population== According to the 2016 census of population, there were 22,890 people in Goulburn. * Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 4.3% of the population. * 83.7% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were England 1.9%, New Zealand 1.0%, India 0.6% and Philippines 0.6%. * 86.7% of people spoke only English at home. * The most common responses for religion were Catholic 28.7%, Anglican 25.3% and No Religion 20.7%.50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. ==Geography== Goulburn is located a small distance east of the peak ridge of the Great Dividing Range and is above sea level. It is intersected by the Wollondilly River and the Mulwaree River, and the confluence of these two rivers is also located here. The Wollondilly then flows north-east, into Lake Burragorang (Warragamba Dam) and eventually into the Tasman Sea via the Hawkesbury River. ==Climate== Owing to its elevation, Goulburn has a subtropical highland climate (Cfb) with warm summers and cool winters, and a high diurnal temperature variation. Its climate is variable, though generally dry with maximum temperatures averaging from in July to in January. Rainfall is distributed evenly throughout the year, with an annual average of . Snow occasionally falls,http://www.australianweathernews.com/snow/Snow%20days%20descending.htm although rarely in significant quantities due to the slight foehn effect produced by the ranges to the west of Goulburn‚Äînamely, those straddling Crookwell. Temperature extremes have ranged from . ==Water supply== With a history of water shortages, an underground water supply pipeline was constructed to pump water from the Wingecarribee Reservoir in the Southern Highlands to Goulburn. This pipeline has a capacity of 7.5 ML per day. The $54 million water supply pipeline is the largest construction project in the history of Goulburn. ==Landmarks== As a major settlement of southern New South Wales, Goulburn was the administrative centre for the region and was the location for important buildings of the district. The first lock-up in the town was built in 1830. In 1832 a postal service commenced in Goulburn, four years after the service was adopted in New South Wales. The first town plan had been drawn up by Assistant Surveyor Dixon in 1828, but the site was moved, as it was subject to flooding. The new town plan was drawn up by Surveyor Hoddle and was gazetted in 1833. ===Gallery === Goulburn's second court house was built in 1847; designed by Mortimer Lewis, the colonial architect. James Barnet, the colonial architect from 1862 to 1890, built a number of buildings in Goulburn. These included the Goulburn Gaol that opened 1884; the current court house that opened in 1887; and a post office in 1881. Barnet's successor, Walter Liberty Vernon, was responsible for the first buildings of Kenmore Hospital, completed in 1894. St Saviour's Anglican Cathedral and Hall were designed by Edmund Blacket. Building started in 1874 and it was dedicated in 1884. It was finally consecrated in 1916. A tower was added in 1988 as part of a Bicentennial project but Blacket's plans included a spire which is yet to be added. E.C. Manfred was a prominent local architect responsible for many of the buildings in the city, including the first public swimming baths opened in 1892; the old Town Hall constructed in 1888; the Goulburn Base Hospital designed in 1886; the old Fire Station built in 1890; the Masonic Temple built in 1928; he also designed the earlier building of 1890 it replaced. Goulburn's first permanent fire station built 1890 and designed by local architect E.C. Manfred. The city was home to Kenmore Hospital, a psychiatric hospital which was finally closed in 2003. Goulburn remains a hub for mental health with facilities now located at the Goulburn Base Hospital.

The Police Academy relocated to Goulburn from Sydney in 1984. At this time it was known as the New South Wales Police Academy; however, the name has subsequently changed. The Academy has relocated to the former campus of the Goulburn College of Advanced Education located on the banks of the Wollondilly River. The New South Wales Police Academy is now the largest education institution for law enforcement officers in the southern hemisphere. Since its relocation there has been significant expansion of the facilities including a new site on the Taralga Road which houses the New South Wales Police School of Traffic and Mobile Policing. ===Goulburn Medical Clinic=== Entry to the Goulburn Medical Clinic from McKell Place The Goulburn Medical Clinic was established in 1946 making it the most longstanding medical practice in the city. Historically, it was the first group practice of any size established in New South Wales and probably only the third in Australia.Coombes, B. (1996) A History of the Goulburn Medical Clinic. Australia: Argyle Press The clinic has a mixture of general practitioners and specialists that provide comprehensive healthcare. ===Goulburn Gaol=== Goulburn is home to Goulburn Correctional Centre, more generically known as Goulburn Gaol. It is a maximum-security male prison, the highest-security prison in Australia and is home to some of the most dangerous, and infamous, prisoners. One of these prisoners was Ivan Robert Marko Milat (27 December 1944 ‚Äì 27 October 2019) an Australian serial killer who was convicted of the backpacker murders in 1996. ===Goulburn Rail Heritage Centre=== The roundhouse at Goulburn was a significant locomotive depot both in the steam and early diesel eras. After closure it became the Goulburn Rail Heritage Centre, a railway museum with preserved steam and diesel locomotives as well as many interesting examples of rolling stock. Some minor rail operators such as RailPower have used the site to restore diesel locomotives to working order for main line use. ==Theatre scene== Goulburn is home to Australia's oldest existing theatre company Lieder Theatre Company, established in 1891. The Lieder Theatre Company presents up to five major performance projects each year, along with numerous community events, readings, workshops, and short seasons of experimental and new work. The company, along with the Lieder Youth Theatre Company, is based in the historic Lieder Theatre, built by the company in 1929. A former quarry adjacent to the Main Southern railway line in North Goulburn was used to film cliff top scenes in the 2016 film Hacksaw Ridge.Aged railway quarry becomes film set for winning blockbuster Track & Signal May 2017 page 70 ==Governance== Goulburn is the seat of the Goulburn Mulwaree Shire local government area (LGA) of New South Wales, Australia, formed in 2004. The most recent elections for Council were held on 13 September 2008. Two of the elected Councillors, Max Hadlow and Keith Woodman resigned due to ill health in 2009. A by-election to fill the vacancies was held in June 2009 and resulted in the election of Councillors Geoffrey Kettle and Geoffrey Peterson. Councillor Geoffrey Kettle was elected Mayor, replacing Councillor Carol James, in September 2010. ==Transport== Goulburn is approximately two hours' drive from Sydney via the Hume Highway, or a one-hour drive from Canberra via the Federal and Hume Highways. Goulburn was bypassed in 1992 due to increasing traffic on the Hume Highway. Goulburn railway station is the southern terminus of the Southern Highlands Line which reaches from Campbelltown and is part of the NSW TrainLink intercity passenger train system. Most services on the line terminate at Moss Vale, some north-east, meaning Goulburn sees limited passenger service. The station is also served by the long distance Southern XPT and Xplorer trains between Sydey and Griffith, Canberra and Southern Cross railway station in Melbourne. All services are operated by NSW TrainLink. Goulburn Airport is approximately south of Goulburn and services light aircraft. Public transport within Goulburn consists of the local taxi service that operates twenty-seven taxis, Goulburn Radio Cabs.https://www.goulburnradiocabs.com A bus service is operated by PBC Goulburn. Goulburn Tourist Information Centre has a Tesla Motors Supercharger station. ==MediaRadio stations=== Radio stations with transmitters located in or nearby to Goulburn include: AM: * Radio National (2RN) 1098 AM * 2GN 1368 AM (commercial) FM: * Raw FM 87.6 (narrowcast) * Triple J (2JJJ) 88.7 FM * ABC Classic FM (2ABCFM) 89.5 FM * ABC Local Radio (2ABCRR) 90.3 FM * Eagle FM 93.5 (2SNO) (commercial) * Sky Sports Radio 94.3 FM (narrowcast) * ABC NewsRadio (2PNN) 99.9 FM * Kix Country Radio 100.7 FM (narrowcast) * 2GCR 103.3 FM (community) Depending on location some Illawarra- and/or Canberra- based radio stations can also heard. ===Television=== Goulburn receives five free-to-air television networks relayed from Canberra, and broadcast from nearby Mt Gray: * ABC * SBS * Prime7 *9 Network Canberra *WIN A much smaller retransmission site also exists to cover residences in the suburb of Eastgrove. ==Notable people== * Todd Carney, Australian rugby league footballer * Jarrod Croker, Australian rugby league player, captain Canberra Raiders (2015‚Äì) * Bruce Devlin, former professional golfer who won 8 tournaments on the US PGA Tour * Michael Diamond, Target Shooter and Olympic gold medalist * Miles Franklin, (1879‚Äì1954) writer and feminist * William Hovell, (1786‚Äì1875) a famous English-born Australian explorer is buried in one of the many cemeteries * George Lazenby (born 1939), the only Australian actor to play James Bond, in On Her Majesty's Secret ServiceGordon, Chris. \\"Lazenby's Goulburn bond\\" Goulburn Post, 3 November 2010 * George Ogilvie, theatre director, born in Goulburn in 1931 * Simon Poidevin, Australian Rugby Union Player and World Cup Winner in 1991 * Donald MacDonald, (1857‚Äì1937) Australian pastoralist * Kate Ritchie, actress and former radio host * Ursula Stephens, Australian ALP Senator (2002‚Äì2014) * Glen Turner, Australian Kookaburras hockey player * Andrew Blackshaw, international softball player * Marc McDermott, (1871‚Äì1929) American silent film star ==See also== * Goulburn Airport * Goulburn Rugby Union * Pejar Dam * Goulburn railway station * Wakefield Park * High School, Goulburn ==References== ==External links== *Goulburn Mulwaree Council *Goulburn Visitor Information Centre * * *VisitNSW.com ‚Äì Goulburn Area Category:Southern Tablelands Category:Hume Highway ","title":"Goulburn, New South Wales"},{"id":"525876","text":"SIG Sauer is the brand name used by two sister companies involved in the design and manufacture of firearms. The original company, SIG Sauer GmbH, is a German company, formed in 1976 as a partnership between Schweizerische Industrie Gesellschaft (SIG) of Switzerland and J.P. Sauer & Sohn of Germany. SIG (now known as SIG Combibloc Group) no longer has any firearms business. Their firearms subsidiary, SIG Arms AG, was sold to L&O; Holding in western Germany and was first renamed SAN Swiss Arms AG‚Äîcommonly known as Swiss Arms‚Äîand in late 2019 was further renamed SIG SAUER AG. A separate company was founded in Virginia in 1985 (with the name SIGARMS) to import and distribute SIG Sauer firearms into the United States; its headquarters were moved to New Hampshire in 1990. This company was renamed SIG Sauer, Inc. in 2007, and since 2000 has been organizationally separate from SIG Sauer GmbH. L&O; Holding is currently the parent company of German-based SIG Sauer GmbH & Co. KG, Swiss- based SIG SAUER AG and US-based SIG Sauer, Inc. ==HistorySchweizerische Waggon Fabrik=== The origins of the SIG Sauer company lie in the company named Schweizerische Waggon Fabrik (\\"Swiss Wagon Factory\\"), which was founded in 1853 by Friedrich Peyer im Hof (1817‚Äì1900), Heinrich Moser (1805-1874) and Johann Conrad Neher (1818-1877). In 1860, a state-of-the-art rifle of their creation won a competition by Switzerland's Federal Ministry of Defense, resulting in the award of a contract to produce 30,000 Prelaz-Burnand rifles. The Pr√©laz-Burnand 1859 was invented by gunsmith Jean-Louis Joseph Pr√©laz and an army officer Edouard Burnand and adopted as M1863 rifle (15,566 made by SIG). === Schweizerische Industrie Gesellschaft (SIG) === Upon receiving the government contract to produce rifles, the company name was changed to Schweizerische Industrie Gesellschaft (SIG, German for \\"Swiss Industrial Company\\"), known as Soci√©t√© Industrielle Suisse in French-speaking regions of Switzerland, reflecting the new emphasis on their production. The SIG P210 pistol was developed in 1947 based on the French Mod√®le 1935 pistol (the Petter-Browning design was licensed). It was adopted by the Swiss military in 1949 as the \\"Pistole 49\\". This single-action semi-automatic P210 brought SIG much acclaim, due to the precision manufacturing processes employed in its manufacture and its resultant accuracy and reliability. The P210 frame design incorporates external rails that fit closely with the slide, thus eliminating play in the mechanism during firing. The P210 was noted for its extreme accuracy. The Petter-Browning patent which was a refinement of the Browning Hi-Power (P35) which was John Moses Browning's last design which was created for the French 1935 pistol, but not adopted. In the 1970s SIG purchased both H√§mmerli and J. P. Sauer and Sohn, which resulted in the formation of SIG Sauer. A new design of firearm was created in response to the Swiss military and police requirement for a handgun to replace the P210. The new design was based on the Petter-Browning design but was simplified. It should properly be called the SIG Sauer System, which is, in fact, the labelling on one of the first SIG Sauer handguns. A modified SIG Sauer P220 design was produced for the Browning Arms company in 1977. On the right side of the slide are the words \\"SIG Sauer System\\". This was the first SIG Sauer P220 type sold in the US. When the sales of the Browning BDA ceased in 1980 the P220 was sold in its own form. Swiss law limits the ability of Swiss companies to export firearms. Swiss companies which wish to do this have to do so by using a foreign partner. In the case of SIG, they chose the German firm of J.P. Sauer & Sohn. In partnering with Sauer, SIG also combined their expertise in firearms design. The Sauer 38H had been produced in competition with other German makers such as Mauser and Walther at a time with new designs began to feature a double/single action trigger. The Double Action trigger mechanism combined with the advanced safety features including the hammer lowering decocking lever, were contributed by Sauer to the new P220 design. SIG Sauer's line of handguns began in 1975 with the SIG Sauer SIG P220. Prior to World War II, Sauer had been primarily a maker of shotguns and hunting rifles. During the war, they produced a handgun, the Sauer 38H, but afterwards had withdrawn from this market. With SIG as their partner/owner, Sauer returned to the business of manufacturing handguns. ===SIG Sauer, Inc.=== A SIG Sauer P226 semi- automatic pistol, with magazine removed SIG Sauer P226 Elite Platinum 9mm SIG Sauer 1911 Super Target .45 ACP In January 1985, SIG Sauer established a subsidiary, SIGARMS, in Tyson's Corner, Virginia, to import the P220 and P230 models into the United States. Two years later the firm moved to a larger facility in Herndon, Virginia, and introduced models P225, P226 and P228. SIGARMS moved to Exeter, New Hampshire, in 1990 where production facilities had been established and production began on the P229 in 1992. SIG's remaining firearms business was sold to Michael L√ºke and Thomas Ortmeier's L&O; Holding in October 2000, and became known as Swiss Arms, although its products were still using the SIG Sauer brand. In 2004, according to CEO Ron Cohen, the company was near failure with just 130 employees. Cohen decided to add AR-15 style rifles to the company's product catalog, which he credits with saving the company. In late 2019, Swiss Arms was renamed SIG SAUER AG. In 2007, SIGARMS changed its name to SIG Sauer, Inc. There are now two SIG Sauer sister companies, one in Newington, New Hampshire, in the United States (sometimes also called SIG Sauer USA); and the other in Eckernf√∂rde, Schleswig-Holstein in northern Germany. All new SIG Sauer offerings have been designed in the United States since the establishment of SIG Sauer Inc. By 2016, it had over 1,000 employees and was selling more than 43,000 firearms a year. According to SIG Sauer, one-third of law enforcement in the United States use SIG firearms. SIG Sauer operates a firearms training school‚ÄîSIG Sauer Academy in Epping, New Hampshire‚Äîwith courses taught by experienced instructors many of whom have military and/or police backgrounds. SIG Sauer produces a wide range of accessories for the firearms and sporting goods industry. ===US Modular Handgun System bid=== SIG Sauer P320 The US military has produced a requirement for a new handgun to replace the current M9 model (Beretta 92FS). In February 2016, bids were submitted by 12 companies to compete for this contract which was expected to result in purchases of more than 500,000 pieces. On 1 July 2016, SIG Sauer was reported to be one of three remaining competitors who were in consideration for this contract. On 19 January 2017, SIG Sauer was awarded the contract for the P320. On July 12, 2018 SIG SAUER announced that the Texas Department of Public Safety (TXDPS) has integrated the SIG SAUER P320 as its official service firearm throughout its divisions. === SIG Air === In 2015, SIG Sauer expanded to include suppressors, optics, ammo and airguns, aiming to provide its dedicated customer base with a greater range of firearm and firearm safety equipment and accessories. On January 12, 2016, SIG Sauer introduced its ASP (Advanced Sport Pellet) line of airguns, which included CO2 Powerlet-powered pistols and rifles featuring the proprietary RPM‚Ñ¢ (Rapid Pellet Magazine) pellet drive system consisting of a belt inside a box magazine-shaped housing, reportedly capable of feeding 30 rounds in 3.5 seconds. These ASP airguns are engineered to have the same appearance, dimension and weight as well as similar trigger pull as the company's centerfire firearm models, for the purpose of sporting and training with the added benefit of reduced cost, minimal noise, the ability to practise outside dedicated shooting ranges and less restrictive laws. In addition to airguns, SIG SAUER also offered a wide variety of ASP targets and pellet ammunition. In a press event on July 25, 2018, SIG Sauer announced that its airgun division was renamed to SIG Air, and introduced its Precision Line air rifles, starting with the ASP20 break-barrel air rifle. On April 24, 2019, SIG Air expanded the Precision Line by introducing its first pre-charged pneumatic (PCP) air rifle featuring its proprietary Rapid Pellet Magazine, the semi- automatic MCX Virtus PCP, based on the centerfire MCX Virtus Patrol rifle. On November 5, 2018, the United States Coast Guard, which has long used the .40 caliber SIG P229 as its duty sidearm, announced that it will acquire the SIG Air ProForce P229 airsoft pistol (which was then produced under brand licensing by French airsoft manufacturer CyberGun) as its new training pistol to give cadets and guardsmen the ability to practice gun handling, conduct target practice in various environments, and train in realistic force-on-force scenarios. In response, SIG Air announced on January 17, 2019 the introduction of its own in-house ProForce high-end airsoft line for professional training, with the initial offerings include the M17 and P229 airsoft pistol. SIG Air also announced that \\"we are rapidly expanding the SIG AIR business, and it is important to us to assume full control to ensure all SIG Air products are of the highest quality\\", and they will no longer be licensing the \\"SIG\\" brand or trademarks for sale by commercial airsoft manufacturers. === Closure of German branch === On June 4, 2020, SIG Sauer announced it intended to close its factory at Eckernf√∂rde by year's end, resulting in losses of about 125 jobs as well plans to fulfill purchase orders. SIG Sauer blamed \\"locational handicaps\\" hindering its sales, claiming \\"a few other local producers\\" were preferred in government purchases for the German police forces and the Bundeswehr. According to manager Tim Castagne, \\"due to its international orientation, SIG Sauer is systematically excluded from tenders [in Germany].\\" This was compounded by reports in April that Kiel prosecutors were investigating claims of SIG USA, SIG Sauer's North American branch, being implicated in exporting weapons to Colombia and Mexico without a legal export permit from the German government, drawing attacks from critics such as Sevim Daƒüdelen from the Left Party after Germany published its 2019 arms export data in May. == Products  SIG Sauer brand ===  Semi-automatic pistols  ;Full size * P210 * P220 * P226 * P227 * P230 * SIG Pro series (2009, 2022, 2340) * GSR * Mosquito * 1911 Series * SIG Sauer M17 ;Compact size * P224 * P225 * P228 (M11) * P229 * P230 * P239 * P245 * SIG Sauer M18 ;Sub Compact * 1911 Army Compact * 1911 C3 Compact ;Ultra Compact * 1911 Two Tone Ultra Compact * 1911 Ultra Compact ;Micro Compact * P238 * P290 * P290RS * P365 * P938 ;Modular * P250 Series * P320 Series  Submachine guns  * MPX  Rifles  * SSG 2000 * SSG 3000 * SIGM400/TREAD * SIG516 * SIG556xi * SIG716i/SIG716G2 * MCX VIRTUS * NGSW-R MCX SPEAR (chambered in 6.8mm SPC) * SIG SHR 970 * CROSS (AR-style bolt-action hybrid \\"precision hunting\\" rifle)  Light machine guns  * MG-6.8 (NGSW-AR, chambered in 6.8mm SPC)  Suppressors  * Rifle * Pistol * Rimfire  Electro-optics  * Telescopic sights * Red dot sights * Iron sights * Magnifiers * Tactical light * Laser sights * Spotting scopes * Laser rangefinders * Binoculars * Mounts  Ammunition  * Rifle cartridges * Handgun cartridges * Airgun pellets * CO2 cylinder  Gear & accessories  * Training targets and pellet traps * Pistol brace * Sling * Gun case * Earmuffs * Holsters and pouches * Kershaw Knives * Apparel === SIG Air brand ===  Air pistol  * SIG Air P226 ASP * SIG Air P320 ASP * SIG Air P320-M17 * SIG Air X-Five ASP * SIG Air P365 * SIG Air 1911 * SIG Air Precision Super Target Air Pistol (single-stroke pneumatic pistol)  Air rifle  * SIG Air MPX ASP * SIG Air MCX ASP * SIG Air MCX Virtus PCP * SIG Air ASP20 (break barrel gas piston spring air rifle)  Airsoft  * SIG Air ProForce M17 * SIG Air ProForce P229 * SIG Air ProForce MCX Virtus AEG == See also == * List of firearm brands ==References*SIG716 for AƒåR was rejected after tests *Photographs of Peyer im Hof, Moser, and Neher *Prelaz-Burnand Rifle *Further Reading on SIG Sauer Category:Companies based in Rockingham County, New Hampshire Category:Firearm manufacturers of Germany Category:Firearm manufacturers of Switzerland Category:Firearm manufacturers of the United States Category:Firearm importation companies of the United States Category:L√ºke & Ortmeier Gruppe Category:Companies based in New Hampshire ","title":"SIG Sauer"},{"id":"525886","text":"Mehmed \\"Me≈°a\\" Selimoviƒá (; ; 26 April 1910 ‚Äì 11 July 1982) was a Yugoslav writer, whose novel Death and the Dervish is one of the most important literary works in post-Second World War Yugoslavia.Mala eciklopedija Prosveta: op≈°ta enciklopedija, 1986, Prosveta, Beograd, . Some of the main themes in his works are the relations between individuality and authority, life and death, and other existential problems. ==Biography== Selimoviƒá was born to a prominent Muslim family of Serbian origin on 26 April 1910 in Tuzla, Bosnia and Herzegovina, where he graduated from elementary school and high school. In 1930, he enrolled to study the Serbo-Croatian language and literature at the University of Belgrade Faculty of Philology and graduated in 1934. His lecturers included Bogdan Popoviƒá, Pavle Popoviƒá, Vladimir ƒÜoroviƒá, Veselin ƒåajkanoviƒá, Aleksandar Beliƒá and Stjepan Kuljbakin. In 1936, he returned to Tuzla to teach in the gymnasium that today bears his name. At that time he participated in the Soko athletic organisation. He spent the first two years of the Second World War in Tuzla, until he was arrested for participation in the Partisan anti-fascist resistance movement in 1943. After his release, he moved to liberated territory, became a member of Communist Party of Yugoslavia and the political commissar of the Tuzla Detachment of the Partisans. During the war, Selimoviƒá's brother, also a communist, was executed by partisans' firing squad for alleged theft, without trial; Selimoviƒá's letter in defense of the brother was to no avail. That episode apparently affected Me≈°a's later contemplative introduction to Death and the Dervish, where the main protagonist Ahmed Nurudin fails to rescue his imprisoned brother. After the war, he briefly resided in Belgrade, and in 1947 he moved to Sarajevo, where he was the professor of High School of Pedagogy and Faculty of Philology, art director of Bosna Film, chief of the drama section of the National Theater, and chief editor of the publishing house Svjetlost. Exasperated by a latent conflict with several local politicians and intellectuals, in 1971 he moved to Belgrade, where he lived until his death in 1982. In his 1976 letter to the Serbian Academy of Science and Arts, Selimoviƒá stated for the historical record that he regarded himself as a Serb and belonging to the corpus of Serbian literature.Veƒçernje Novosti: Prona≈°ao mir u Beogradu, Dragan BOGUTOVIƒÜ, 9 July 2010 In his autobiography, Sjeƒáanja, Selimoviƒá states that his paternal ancestry is from the Orthodox Christian Vujoviƒá brotherhood of the Drobnjak clan, his ancestor having converted to Islam in the 17th century for pragmatic reasons, given the presence of the Muslim Ottoman Empire in the area at the time. Selimoviƒá was a member of Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts.Me≈°a SELIMOVIƒÜ . Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts ==Works== Selimoviƒá began writing fairly late in his life. His first short story (Pjesma u oluji / A song in the storm) was published in 1948, when he was thirty-six. His first book, a collection of short stories Prva ƒçeta (The First Company) was published in 1950 when he was forty. His subsequent work, Ti≈°ine (Silences) was published eleven years later in 1961. The following books Tuƒëa zemlja (Foreign land, 1962) and Magla i mjeseƒçina (Mist and Moonlight, 1965) did not receive widespread recognition either. However, his novel Death and the Dervish (Dervi≈° i smrt, 1966) was widely received as a masterpiece. The plot of the novel takes place in 18th-century Sarajevo under Ottoman rule, and reflects Selimoviƒá's own torment of the execution of his brother; the story speaks of the futility of one man's resistance against a repressive system, and the change that takes place within that man after he becomes a part of that very system. Some critics have likened this novel to Kafka's The Trial. It has been translated into many languages, including English, Russian, German, French, Italian, Turkish and Arabic. Each chapter of the novel opens with a Qur'an citation, the first being: \\"In the name of God, the most compassionate, the most merciful.\\" The next novel, Tvrƒëava (The Fortress, 1970), placed still further in the past, is slightly more optimistic, and fulfilled with faith in love, unlike the lonely contemplations and fear in Death and the Dervish. The Fortress and Death and the Dervish are the only novels of Selimoviƒá that have thus far been translated into English. Subsequent novels Ostrvo (The Island, 1974), featuring an elderly couple facing aging and eventual death on a Dalmatian island, and posthumously published Krug (The Circle, 1983), have not been translated into English. He also wrote a book about Vuk Karad≈æiƒá's orthographic reforms Za i protiv Vuka (For and Against Vuk),http://www.rastko.rs/rastko- bl/umetnost/knjizevnost/mselimovic/mselimovic-vuk_l.html as well as his autobiography, Sjeƒáanja. ==Bibliography== Plaque at his former home in Belgrade *Uvrijeƒëeni ƒçovjek (An Insulted Man) (1947) *Prva ƒçeta (The First Company) (1950) *Tuƒëa zemlja (Foreign Lands) (1957) *Sjeƒáanja (Memories) (1957) *Noƒái i jutra (Nights and Days) (film scenario) (1958) *Ti≈°ine (Silence) (1961) *Magla i mjeseƒçina (Mist and Moonlight) (1965) *Eseji i ogledi (Essays and Reflections) (1966) *Dervi≈° i smrt (Death and the Dervish) (1966) *Za i protiv Vuka (Pro et Contra Vuk) (1967) *Tvrƒëava (The Fortress) (1970) *Ostrvo (The Island) (1974) *Krug (The Circle) (1983) ===Translations into English=== *Death and the Dervish, 1996, Northwestern University Press, *The Fortress, 1999, Northwestern University Press, ==References== ;Citations ==External links== *Death and the Dervish by Mesa Selimovic (fragments), translated by Lazar Pascanovic *Mesa Selimovic in South Slavic Literature Library *For and Against Vuk, study by Me≈°a Selimoviƒá, 1967; courtesy of Project Rastko ‚Äì Banja Luka *Me≈°a Selimoviƒá's 'Oriental Novels' *Me≈°a Selimoviƒá's parts of biography *Me≈°a Selimoviƒá ‚Äì Facebook page Category:1910 births Category:1982 deaths Category:People from Tuzla Category:20th-century novelists Category:Serbian writers Category:Yugoslav writers Category:Bosnia and Herzegovina writers Category:Yugoslav Partisans members Category:University of Belgrade Faculty of Philology alumni Category:Members of the Association of Writers of Serbia Category:Members of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts Category:Burials at Belgrade New Cemetery ","title":"Me≈°a Selimoviƒá"},{"id":"525887","text":"In solid state physics and condensed matter physics, the density of states (DOS) of a system describes the proportion of states that are to be occupied by the system at each energy. The density of states is defined as D(E) = N(E)/V , where N(E)\\\\delta E is the number of states in the system of volume V whose energies lie in the range E+\\\\delta E. It is mathematically represented as a distribution by a probability density function, and it is generally an average over the space and time domains of the various states occupied by the system. The density of states is directly related to the dispersion relations of the properties of the system. High DOS at a specific energy level means that many states are available for occupation. Generally, the density of states of matter is continuous. In isolated systems however, such as atoms or molecules in the gas phase, the density distribution is discrete, like a spectral density. Local variations, most often due to distortions of the original system, are often referred to as local densities of states (LDOSs). ==Introduction== In quantum mechanical systems, waves, or wave-like particles, can occupy modes or states with wavelengths and propagation directions dictated by the system. For example, in some systems, the interatomic spacing and the atomic charge of a material might allow only electrons of certain wavelengths to exist. In other systems, the crystalline structure of a material might allow waves to propagate in one direction, while suppressing wave propagation in another direction. Often, only specific states are permitted. Thus, it can happen that many states are available for occupation at a specific energy level, while no states are available at other energy levels . Looking at the density of states of electrons at the band edge between the valence and conduction bands in a semiconductor, for an electron in the conduction band, an increase of the electron energy makes more states available for occupation. Alternatively, the density of state is discontinuous for an interval of energy, which means that no states are available for electrons to occupy within the band gap of the material. This condition also means that an electron at the conduction band edge must lose at least the band gap energy of the material in order to transition to another state in the valence band. This determines if the material is an insulator or a metal in the dimension of the propagation. The result of the number of states in a band is also useful for predicting the conduction properties. For example, in a one dimensional crystalline structure an odd number of electrons per atom results in a half-filled top band; here are free electrons at the Fermi level resulting in a metal. On the other hand, an even number of electrons exactly fills a whole number of bands, leaving the rest empty. If then the Fermi level lies in an occupied band gap between the highest occupied state and the lowest empty state, the material will be an insulator or semiconductor. Depending on the quantum mechanical system, the density of states can be calculated for electrons, photons, or phonons, and can be given as a function of either energy or the wave vector k. To convert between the DOS as a function of the energy and the DOS as a function of the wave vector, the system-specific energy dispersion relation between E and k must be known. In general, the topological properties of the system such as the band structure, have a major impact on the properties of the density of states. The most well-known systems, like neutronium in neutron stars and free electron gases in metals (examples of degenerate matter and a Fermi gas), have a 3-dimensional Euclidean topology. Less familiar systems, like two-dimensional electron gases (2DEG) in graphite layers and the quantum Hall effect system in MOSFET type devices, have a 2-dimensional Euclidean topology. Even less familiar are carbon nanotubes, the quantum wire and Luttinger liquid with their 1-dimensional topologies. Systems with 1D and 2D topologies are likely to become more common, assuming developments in nanotechnology and materials science proceed. ==Definition== The density of states related to volume V and N countable energy levels is defined as: : D(E) = \\\\frac{1}{V} \\\\, \\\\sum _{i=1}^N \\\\delta (E - E({\\\\mathbf{k}}_i)). Because the smallest allowed change of momentum k for a particle in a box of dimension d and length L is (\\\\Delta k)^d = (\\\\tfrac{2\\\\pi}{L})^d , the volume-related density of states for continuous energy levels is obtained in the limit L \\\\to \\\\infty as : D(E) := \\\\int_{\\\\mathbb{R}^d}{\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}^d k}{(2\\\\pi)^d}} \\\\cdot \\\\delta (E - E(\\\\mathbf{k})), Here, d is the spatial dimension of the considered system and \\\\mathbf{k} the wave vector. For isotropic one-dimensional systems with parabolic energy dispersion, the density of states isD_{1D}(E)=\\\\tfrac{1}{\\\\pi\\\\hbar}(\\\\tfrac{2m}{E})^{1/2}. In two dimensions the density of states is a constant D_{2D}=\\\\tfrac{m}{\\\\pi\\\\hbar^2}, while in three dimensions it becomes D_{3D}(E)=\\\\tfrac{m}{\\\\pi^2\\\\hbar^3}(2mE)^{1/2}. Equivalently, the density of states can also be understood as the derivative of the microcanonical partition function Z_m (E) (that is, the total number of states with energy less than E) with respect to the energy: : D(E) = \\\\frac {1}{V} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d} Z_m (E)}{\\\\mathrm{d} E}. The number of states with energy E' (degree of degeneracy) is given by: : g\\\\left(E'\\\\right) = \\\\lim _{\\\\Delta E\\\\to 0} \\\\int _{E'}^{E' + \\\\Delta E} D(E) \\\\mathrm{d} E = \\\\lim _{\\\\Delta E\\\\to 0} D\\\\left(E'\\\\right) \\\\Delta E, where the last equality only applies when the mean value theorem for integrals is valid. ==Symmetry== FCC lattice, a truncated octahedron, showing symmetry labels for high symmetry lines and points There is a large variety of systems and types of states for which DOS calculations can be done. Some condensed matter systems possess a structural symmetry on the microscopic scale which can be exploited to simplify calculation of their densities of states. In spherically symmetric systems, the integrals of functions are one-dimensional because all variables in the calculation depend only on the radial parameter of the dispersion relation. Fluids, glasses and amorphous solids are examples of a symmetric system whose dispersion relations have a rotational symmetry. Octahedron. Measurements on powders or polycrystalline samples require evaluation and calculation functions and integrals over the whole domain, most often a Brillouin zone, of the dispersion relations of the system of interest. Sometimes the symmetry of the system is high, which causes the shape of the functions describing the dispersion relations of the system to appear many times over the whole domain of the dispersion relation. In such cases the effort to calculate the DOS can be reduced by a great amount when the calculation is limited to a reduced zone or fundamental domain. The Brillouin zone of the face-centered cubic lattice (FCC) in the figure on the right has the 48-fold symmetry of the point group Oh with full octahedral symmetry. This configuration means that the integration over the whole domain of the Brillouin zone can be reduced to a 48-th part of the whole Brillouin zone. As a crystal structure periodic table shows, there are many elements with a FCC crystal structure, like diamond, silicon and platinum and their Brillouin zones and dispersion relations have this 48-fold symmetry. Two other familiar crystal structures are the body- centered cubic lattice (BCC) and hexagonal closed packed structures (HCP) with cubic and hexagonal lattices, respectively. The BCC structure has the 24-fold pyritohedral symmetry of the point group Th. The HCP structure has the 12-fold prismatic dihedral symmetry of the point group D3h. A complete list of symmetry properties of a point group can be found in point group character tables. In general it is easier to calculate a DOS when the symmetry of the system is higher and the number of topological dimensions of the dispersion relation is lower. The DOS of dispersion relations with rotational symmetry can often be calculated analytically. This result is fortunate, since many materials of practical interest, such as steel and silicon, have high symmetry. In anisotropic condensed matter systems such as a single crystal of a compound, the density of states could be different in one crystallographic direction than in another. These causes the anisotropic density of states to be more difficult to visualize, and might require methods such as calculating the DOS for particular points or directions only, or calculating the projected density of states (PDOS) to a particular crystal orientation. ==k-space topologies== Figure 1: Spherical surface in k-space for electrons in three dimensions. The density of states is dependent upon the dimensional limits of the object itself. In a system described by three orthogonal parameters (3 Dimension), the units of DOS is Energy‚àí1Volume‚àí1 , in a two dimensional system, the units of DOS is Energy‚àí1Area‚àí1 , in a one dimensional system, the units of DOS is Energy‚àí1Length‚àí1. The referenced volume is the volume of k-space; the space enclosed by the constant energy surface of the system derived through a dispersion relation that relates E to k. An example of a 3-dimensional k-space is given in Fig. 1. It can be seen that the dimensionality of the system confines the momentum of particles inside the system. ===Density of wave vector states (sphere)=== The calculation for DOS starts by counting the N allowed states at a certain k that are contained within inside the volume of the system. This procedure is done by differentiating the whole k-space volume \\\\Omega_{n, k} in n-dimensions at an arbitrary k, with respect to k. The volume, area or length in 3, 2 or 1-dimensional spherical k-spaces are expressed by : \\\\Omega_n(k) = c_n k^n for a n-dimensional k-space with the topologically determined constants : c_1 = 2,\\\\ c_2 = \\\\pi,\\\\ c_3 = \\\\frac{4 \\\\pi}{3} for linear, disk and spherical symmetrical shaped functions in 1, 2 and 3-dimensional Euclidean k-spaces respectively. According to this scheme, the density of wave vector states N is, through differentiating \\\\Omega_{n,k} with respect to k, expressed by :N_n(k) = \\\\frac{{\\\\rm d}\\\\Omega_n(k)}{{\\\\rm d}k} = n\\\\; c_n\\\\; k^{n - 1} The 1, 2 and 3-dimensional density of wave vector states for a line, disk, or sphere are explicitly written as : \\\\begin{align} N_1(k) &= 2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ N_2(k) &= 2 \\\\pi k \\\\\\\\\\\\ N_3(k) &= 4 \\\\pi k^2 \\\\end{align} One state is large enough to contain particles having wavelength Œª. The wavelength is related to k through the relationship. : k = \\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{\\\\lambda} In a quantum system the length of Œª will depend on a characteristic spacing of the system L that is confining the particles. Finally the density of states N is multiplied by a factor s/V_k, where s is a constant degeneracy factor that accounts for internal degrees of freedom due to such physical phenomena as spin or polarization. If no such phenomenon is present then s = 1. Vk is the volume in k-space whose wavevectors are smaller than the smallest possible wavevectors decided by the characteristic spacing of the system. ===Density of energy states=== To finish the calculation for DOS find the number of states per unit sample volume at an energy E inside an interval [E, E+dE]. The general form of DOS of a system is given as :D_n\\\\left(E\\\\right) = \\\\frac{{\\\\rm d}\\\\Omega_n(E)}{{\\\\rm d}E} The scheme sketched so far only applies to monotonically rising and spherically symmetric dispersion relations. In general the dispersion relation E(k) is not spherically symmetric and in many cases it isn't continuously rising either. To express D as a function of E the inverse of the dispersion relation E(k) has to be substituted into the expression of \\\\Omega_n(k) as a function of k to get the expression of \\\\Omega_n(E) as a function of the energy. If the dispersion relation is not spherically symmetric or continuously rising and can't be inverted easily then in most cases the DOS has to be calculated numerically. More detailed derivations are available.Sample density of states calculationAnother density of states calculation ==Dispersion relations== The dispersion relation for electrons in a solid is given by the electronic band structure. The kinetic energy of a particle depends on the magnitude and direction of the wave vector k, the properties of the particle and the environment in which the particle is moving. For example, the kinetic energy of an electron in a Fermi gas is given by : E = E_0 + \\\\frac{\\\\left(\\\\hbar k\\\\right)^2}{2m} \\\\ , where m is the electron mass. The dispersion relation is a spherically symmetric parabola and it is continuously rising so the DOS can be calculated easily. Figure 2: Monatomic chain phonon dispersion relation For longitudinal phonons in a string of atoms the dispersion relation of the kinetic energy in a 1-dimensional k-space, as shown in Figure 2, is given by :E = 2 \\\\hbar \\\\omega_0 \\\\left\\\\sin\\\\left(\\\\frac{ka}{2}\\\\right)\\\\right where \\\\omega_0 = \\\\sqrt{k_{\\\\rm F} / m} is the oscillator frequency, m the mass of the atoms, k_{\\\\rm F} the inter-atomic force constant and a inter-atomic spacing. For small values of k \\\\ll \\\\pi / a the dispersion relation is rather linear: :E = \\\\hbar \\\\omega_0 ka When k \\\\approx \\\\pi / a the energy is :E = 2 \\\\hbar \\\\omega_0 \\\\left\\\\cos\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\pi - ka}{2}\\\\right)\\\\right With the transformation q = k - \\\\pi/a and small q this relation can be transformed to :E = 2 \\\\hbar \\\\omega_0 \\\\left[1 - \\\\left(\\\\frac{qa}{2}\\\\right)^2\\\\right] ===Isotropic dispersion relations=== The two examples mentioned here can be expressed like :E = E_0 + c_k k^p This expression is a kind of dispersion relation because it interrelates two wave properties and it is isotropic because only the length and not the direction of the wave vector appears in the expression. The magnitude of the wave vector is related to the energy as: :k = \\\\left(\\\\frac{E - E_0}{c_k}\\\\right)^\\\\frac{1}{p} \\\\ , Accordingly, the volume of n-dimensional k-space containing wave vectors smaller than k is: :\\\\Omega_n(k) = c_n k^n Substitution of the isotropic energy relation gives the volume of occupied states :\\\\Omega_n(E) = \\\\frac{c_n}{{c_k}^\\\\frac{n}{p}}\\\\left(E - E_0\\\\right)^\\\\frac{n}{p}\\\\ , Differentiating this volume with respect to the energy gives an expression for the DOS of the isotropic dispersion relation :D_n\\\\left(E\\\\right) = \\\\frac {d}{dE}\\\\Omega_n(E) = \\\\frac{n c_n}{p {c_k}^\\\\frac{n}{p}} \\\\left(E - E_0\\\\right)^{\\\\frac{n}{p} - 1} ===Parabolic dispersion=== Figure 3: Free-electron DOS in 3-dimensional k-space In the case of a parabolic dispersion relation (p = 2), such as applies to free electrons in a Fermi gas, the resulting density of states, D_n\\\\left(E\\\\right), for electrons in a n-dimensional systems is :\\\\begin{align} D_1\\\\left(E\\\\right) &= \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{c_k \\\\left(E - E_0\\\\right)}} \\\\\\\\\\\\ D_2\\\\left(E\\\\right) &= \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{c_k} \\\\\\\\\\\\ D_3\\\\left(E\\\\right) &= 2 \\\\pi \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{E - E_0}{c_k^3}} \\\\ . \\\\end{align} for E > E_0, with D(E) = 0 for E < E_0. In 1-dimensional systems the DOS diverges at the bottom of the band as E drops to E_0. In 2-dimensional systems the DOS turns out to be independent of E. Finally for 3-dimensional systems the DOS rises as the square root of the energy. Including the prefactor s/V_k, the expression for the 3D DOS is :N(E) = \\\\frac {V}{2\\\\pi^2} \\\\left(\\\\frac{2m}{\\\\hbar^2}\\\\right)^\\\\frac{3}{2}\\\\sqrt{E - E_0}, where V is the total volume, and N(E-E_0) includes the 2-fold spin degeneracy. ===Linear dispersion=== In the case of a linear relation (p = 1), such as applies to photons, acoustic phonons, or to some special kinds of electronic bands in a solid, the DOS in 1, 2 and 3 dimensional systems is related to the energy as: :\\\\begin{align} D_1\\\\left(E\\\\right) &= \\\\frac{1}{c_k} \\\\\\\\\\\\ D_2\\\\left(E\\\\right) &= \\\\frac{2 \\\\pi}{c_k^2}\\\\left(E - E_0\\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ D_3\\\\left(E\\\\right) &= \\\\frac{4 \\\\pi}{c_k^3}\\\\left(E - E_0\\\\right)^2 \\\\end{align} ==Distribution functions== The density of states plays an important role in the kinetic theory of solids. The product of the density of states and the probability distribution function is the number of occupied states per unit volume at a given energy for a system in thermal equilibrium. This value is widely used to investigate various physical properties of matter. The following are examples, using two common distribution functions, of how applying a distribution function to the density of states can give rise to physical properties. Figure 4: The Fermi-Dirac probability distribution, density of states, and their product for a semiconductor. The lower green lobe depicts hole energy, and thus uses f(-x) as the distribution function. Fermi‚ÄìDirac statistics: The Fermi‚ÄìDirac probability distribution function, Fig. 4, is used to find the probability that a fermion occupies a specific quantum state in a system at thermal equilibrium. Fermions are particles which obey the Pauli exclusion principle (e.g. electrons, protons, neutrons). The distribution function can be written as : f_{\\\\mathrm{FD}}(E) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\exp\\\\left(\\\\frac{E - \\\\mu}{k_\\\\mathrm{B} T}\\\\right) + 1}. \\\\mu is the chemical potential (also denoted as EF and called the Fermi level when T=0), k_\\\\mathrm{B} is the Boltzmann constant, and T is temperature. Fig. 4 illustrates how the product of the Fermi-Dirac distribution function and the three-dimensional density of states for a semiconductor can give insight to physical properties such as carrier concentration and Energy band gaps. Bose‚ÄìEinstein statistics: The Bose‚ÄìEinstein probability distribution function is used to find the probability that a boson occupies a specific quantum state in a system at thermal equilibrium. Bosons are particles which do not obey the Pauli exclusion principle (e.g. phonons and photons). The distribution function can be written as :f_{\\\\mathrm{BE}}(E) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\exp\\\\left(\\\\frac{E - \\\\mu}{k_{\\\\rm B} T}\\\\right) - 1} From these two distributions it is possible to calculate properties such as the internal energy U, the number of particles N, specific heat capacity C, and thermal conductivity k. The relationships between these properties and the product of the density of states and the probability distribution, denoting the density of states by g(E) instead of D(E), are given by :\\\\begin{align} U &= \\\\int E\\\\, f(E)\\\\, g(E)\\\\,{\\\\rm d}E \\\\\\\\\\\\ N &= \\\\int f(E)\\\\, g(E)\\\\,{\\\\rm d}E \\\\\\\\\\\\ C &= \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial T} \\\\int E\\\\, f(E)\\\\, g(E) \\\\,{\\\\rm d}E \\\\\\\\\\\\ k &= \\\\frac{1}{d}\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial T} \\\\int E f(E)\\\\, g(E)\\\\, u(E)\\\\, \\\\Lambda(E)\\\\,{\\\\rm d}E \\\\end{align} d is dimensionality, u is sound velocity and \\\\Lambda is mean free path. ==Applications== The density of states appears in many areas of physics, and helps to explain a number of quantum mechanical phenomena. ===Quantization=== Calculating the density of states for small structures shows that the distribution of electrons changes as dimensionality is reduced. For quantum wires, the DOS for certain energies actually becomes higher than the DOS for bulk semiconductors, and for quantum dots the electrons become quantized to certain energies. ===Photonic crystals=== The photon density of states can be manipulated by using periodic structures with length scales on the order of the wavelength of light. Some structures can completely inhibit the propagation of light of certain colors (energies), creating a photonic band gap: the DOS is zero for those photon energies. Other structures can inhibit the propagation of light only in certain directions to create mirrors, waveguides, and cavities. Such periodic structures are known as photonic crystals. In nanostructured media the concept of local density of states (LDOS) is often more relevant than that of DOS, as the DOS varies considerably from point to point. ==Computational calculation == Interesting systems are in general complex, for instance compounds, biomolecules, polymers, etc. Because of the complexity of these systems the analytical calculation of the density of states is in most of the cases impossible. Computer simulations offer a set of algorithms to evaluate the density of states with a high accuracy. One of these algorithms is called the Wang and Landau algorithm. Within the Wang and Landau scheme any previous knowledge of the density of states is required. One proceeds as follows: the cost function (for example the energy) of the system is discretized. Each time the bin i is reached one updates a histogram for the density of states, g(i), by : g(i) \\\\rightarrow g(i) + f where f is called the modification factor. As soon as each bin in the histogram is visited a certain number of times (10-15), the modification factor is reduced by some criterion, for instance, : f_{n+1} \\\\rightarrow \\\\frac{1}{2} f_{n} where n denotes the n-th update step. The simulation finishes when the modification factor is less than a certain threshold, for instance f_n < 10^{-8} . The Wang and Landau algorithm has some advantages over other common algorithms such as multicanonical simulations and parallel tempering. For example, the density of states is obtained as the main product of the simulation. Additionally, Wang and Landau simulations are completely independent of the temperature. This feature allows to compute the density of states of systems with very rough energy landscape such as proteins. Mathematically the density of states is formulated in terms of a tower of covering maps. ==Local density of states== An important feature of the definition of the DOS is that it can be extended to any system. One of its properties are the translationally invariability which means that the density of the states is homogeneous and it's the same at each point of the system. But this is just a particular case and the LDOS gives a wider description with a heterogeneous density of states through the system. ===Concept=== Local density of states (LDOS) describes a space-resolved density of states. In materials science, for example, this term is useful when interpreting the data from a scanning tunneling microscope (STM), since this method is capable of imaging electron densities of states with atomic resolution. According to crystal structure, this quantity can be predicted by computational methods, as for example with density functional theory. === A general definition === In a local density of states the contribution of each state is weighted by the density of its wave function at the point. N(E) becomes n(E,x) :n(E,x)=\\\\sum_n \\\\phi_n(x)^2\\\\delta(E-\\\\varepsilon_n) the factor of \\\\phi_n(x)^2 means that each state contributes more in the regions where the density is high. An average over x of this expression will restore the usual formula for a DOS. The LDOS is useful in inhomogeneous systems, where n(E,x) contains more information than n(E) alone. For a one-dimensional system with a wall, the sine waves give :n_{1D}(E,x)=\\\\frac{2}{\\\\pi\\\\hbar}\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2m}{E}}\\\\sin^2{kx} where k=\\\\sqrt{2mE}/\\\\hbar. In a three-dimensional system with x>0 the expression is :n_{3D}(E,x)=\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{\\\\sin{2kx}}{2kx}\\\\right)n_{3D}(E) In fact, we can generalise the local density of states further to :n(E,x,x')=\\\\sum_n\\\\phi_n(x)\\\\phi^*_n(x')\\\\delta(E-\\\\varepsilon_n) this is called the spectral function and it's a function with each wave function separately in its own variable. In more advanced theory it is connected with the Green's functions and provides a compact representation of some results such as optical absorption. Space resolved local density of states. A sequence of images with varying gate bias in a nanowire MOSFET at drain bias Vd=0.6V. Notice the confined energy levels as they move with increasing gate bias. ===Solid state devices=== LDOS can be used to gain profit into a solid-state device. For example, the figure on the right illustrates LDOS of a transistor as it turns on and off in a ballistic simulation. The LDOS has clear boundary in the source and drain, that corresponds to the location of band edge. In the channel, the DOS is increasing as gate voltage increase and potential barrier goes down. ===Optics and photonics=== In optics and photonics, the concept of local density of states refers to the states that can be occupied by a photon. For light it is usually measured by fluorescence methods, near-field scanning methods or by cathodoluminescence techniques. For different photonic structures, the LDOS have different behaviors and they are controlling spontaneous emission in different ways. In photonic crystals, the near-zero LDOS are expected and they cause inhibition in the spontaneous emission. The LDOS are still in photonic crystals but now they are in the cavity. In this case, the LDOS can be much more enhanced and they are proportional with Purcell enhancements of the spontaneous emission. Similar LDOS enhancement is also expected in plasmonic cavity. However, in disordered photonic nanostructures, the LDOS behave differently. They fluctuate spatially with their statistics are proportional to the scattering strength of the structures. In addition, the relationship with the mean free path of the scattering is trivial as the LDOS can be still strongly influenced by the short details of strong disorders in the form of a strong Purcell enhancement of the emission. and finally, for the plasmonic disorder, this effect is much stronger for LDOS fluctuations as it can be observed as a strong near-field localization. ==See also== ==References== ==Further reading== *Chen, Gang.

Railway preservation in New Zealand is the preservation of historically significant facets of New Zealand's rail transport history. The earliest recorded preservation attempt took place in 1925, although the movement itself did not start properly until 1960. ==HistoryEarly initiatives=== Early preservation efforts in New Zealand were restricted to static public display of locomotives, and it is believed the first was Double Fairlie E class locomotive E 175 Josephine outside the Dunedin Railway Station in 1925. After this, the preservation movement entered a hiatus until the founding of the New Zealand Railway and Locomotive Society in 1944, which established branches throughout the country. The first act of active railway preservation was started by the NZR&LS; Otago Branch when they purchased a small 9-tonne Fowler 0-4-0T tank locomotive built in 1921 and formerly used by the Public Works Department as their NO 540, from the Otago Harbour Board for use on the fledgeling Ocean Beach Railway, established in 1963. Similar works were soon started in Christchurch by the NZR&LS; Canterbury Branch at their new Ferrymead Railway in Christchurch, the NZR&LS; Auckland Branch at their Glenbrook Vintage Railway and the NZR&LS; Wellington Branch at their Silver Stream Railway. A railway museum was established at Te Awamutu by the NZR&LS; Waikato Branch. However, this period also saw the breakaway of the NZR&LS; Auckland and Canterbury Branches to become the Railway Enthusiasts Society and the Canterbury Railway Society respectively, although they retained an affiliation with the NZR&LS.; ===1960 to 1985=== During the period from 1960 to 1979, the rail preservation scene began to increase as more railway museums and groups were established, helped in part by the closure of rural branch lines by New Zealand Railways. In this category, railway museum groups were set up by the Pleasant Point Museum and Railway at Pleasant Point and the Ashburton Railway and Preservation Society at Tinwald Domain near Ashburton in Canterbury. These groups at the time were attempting to save part of the fabric of rural branch lines that had been operated by New Zealand Railways but were being closed down. As the replacement of steam was accelerated during this period and was completed in 1971, other groups were initiated to preserve the mainline locomotives and rolling stock of NZR. The first group to do so was Steam Incorporated, based out of the former Paekakariki locomotive depot site just north of Wellington. The Museum of Transport and Technology in Auckland also began to accept railway vehicles for preservation, in conjunction with the Bush Tramway Club which was preserving former industrial locomotives used on the bush tramways of New Zealand. Following the end of steam in 1971, NZR placed a total steam ban on the national network, with the exception of its own heritage operation, the famous Kingston Flyer which began operation between Lumsden and Kingston on the Kingston Branch in that year. This ban required that if steam locomotives were to operate in New Zealand, they would be confined to either heritage railways, museums, or private sites. During this time, the majority of groups established began to expand their operations as NZR progressively modernised, and in some cases were able to extend their running lines or establish museum-type displays to showcase their rolling stock. In 1977 the National Federation of Railway Societies was formed to provide a cohesive network between the different groups. This group would work as a coordinator and organiser in later years between different groups. This period also saw the birth of the Otago Excursion Train Trust, founded in 1978 to run excursion trains over the scenic Otago Central Railway. Initially, these trains were run with NZR carriages and locomotives but later the OETT purchased its own fleet of carriages from NZR which were refurbished by Government apprentices and volunteers, first at Burnside railway station and later in the north yard at Dunedin railway station. This group was joined by Steam Incorporated and the Railway Enthusiasts Society in running similar excursions using NZR diesel locomotives but the organising group's own carriages. In 1985, NZR agreed to remove the steam ban in conjunction with the centenary of the start of construction of the North Island Main Trunk. A steam excursion was run from Wellington to Auckland, using Steam Incorporated's KA 945 and the RES' JA 1250 to haul the train of mixed Steam Inc and RES stock. As NZR still used red as the colour for its coaching stock, these groups used their own liveries, predominantly brown or yellow. ===1985 to 2000=== Although the pace of preservation slowed into the early 1980s and beyond, several more groups were established to preserve longer branch lines as well as the more traditional museum-focused operation. The Weka Pass Railway in North Canterbury, the Bay of Islands Vintage Railway in Northland, the Otago-based Dunedin Railways, and the Goldfields Steam Train Society in the Bay of Plenty were all founded during the early 1980s using stock retired by NZR. In the case of Dunedin Railways (formerly known as Taieri Gorge Railway Limited), it was created by the OETT and the Dunedin City Council to preserve the 64-kilometre section of the Otago Central railway between Middlemarch and Wingatui through the Taieri Gorge for passenger operations after the New Zealand Railways Corporation closed the line in 1990. In 1988, numerous preservation groups contributed to the Ferrymead 125 celebrations in Christchurch to mark 125 years since the first public railway opened in New Zealand. With the retirement of the first-generation diesel locomotives, the Diesel Traction Group was founded in Christchurch in 1983 with an aim to preserve these locomotives. By 1990 this group had four locomotives at their Ferrymead base, all of which were built by English Electric. Other groups and individuals started to acquire other first-generation diesel locomotives to add to their fleet, such as Steam Incorporated's two DA class diesel locomotives which were purchased in 1988. Other individuals also purchased similar locomotives for preservation and based them at established heritage sites. NZR also selected numerous diesel and electric locomotives, along with two carriages, for inclusion in their own Heritage Fleet. During this time, Ian Welch's Mainline Steam Trust emerged as a heritage operator with its fleet of preserved ex-NZR steam locomotives. This period also witnessed the creation of other groups such as the Oamaru District Steam & Rail Society, the Grand Tapawera Railroad Company/Nelson Railway Society, the narrow-gauge Blenheim Riverside Railway, and special interest groups such as the Pahiatua Railcar Society. Some groups, such as the Gisborne City Vintage Railway and the Feilding and District Steam Rail Society were formed to preserve a specific locomotive, in this case WA 165 at Gisborne and the NZR&LS;' WAB 794 at Ferrymead. Very few new groups emerged from 1990 to 2000. NZR's successor, Tranz Rail, did give further rolling stock to heritage groups, although a shortage of stock did see some of this recalled temporarily, while heritage diesel locomotives were leased from a private individual to alleviate the reduced number of locomotives. During this time, the NFRS became the Federation of Rail Organisations of New Zealand (FRONZ) to reflect its railway and tramway group members. In 1991 the Rail Heritage Trust of New Zealand was formed with former NZR executive Euan McQueen as its chair, to preserve former NZR buildings and rolling stock, which was leased to other groups. The Rail Heritage trust pioneered the concept of \\"heritage rolling stock\\" which was leased to various preservation groups around New Zealand by Tranz Rail. Over 200 such items of rolling stock are now leased. NZR Lamp on the Weka Pass Railway. ===Current projects=== The most ambitious heritage project to date is the Rimutaka Incline Railway, which proposes to construct from scratch a railway line over an existing historic formation abandoned in 1955. This is the route of the former Rimutaka railway and Rimutaka Incline over a distance of some 20 km, including 5 km of the 1 in 15 incline worked by the Fell centre-rail system. Although the Taieri Gorge Railway in Dunedin is a much longer and successful heritage railway at 60 km length, it has the advantage that all its track was still in place when it was set up in 1990. The Rimutaka proposal faces many obstacles from the construction of new track and formation rehabilitation works, to the building of new locomotives of the Fell type. The project is in the planning stages and it will be some years before any construction starts. Another ambitious project is currently being undertaken by the Wellington and Manawatu Railway Trust, which has recovered the remains of WMR No. 9/NZR N 453 and aims to restore it to full operational condition. Although four ex-WMR coaches and a small number of wagons have survived into preservation, it was believed for many years that no Wellington and Manawatu Railway locomotives were still extant. However, the remains of WMR NO 9 (N 453) were found at Bealey on the Midland Line, and in 2003 the locomotive's frames were retrieved, followed by the tender tank, underframe, and bogie frames in 2005. The WMR Trust ultimately seek to restore NO 9 to working order, and operate this locomotive on the main line. This locomotive will be paired with a replica of a WMR goods wagon to act as a support wagon on the main line. ==See also== * List of New Zealand railway museums and heritage lines == Footnotes == ==References== == Further reading == * * * ","title":"Railway preservation in New Zealand"},{"id":"525901","text":"Aurelijus R≈´tenis Antanas Mockus ≈†ivickas (; born 25 March 1952) is a Colombian mathematician, philosopher, and politician. He has a master's degree in philosophy from the National University of Colombia, and a Honoris Causa PhD from the University of Paris. He is the son of Lithuanian immigrants. He left office as the president of the National University of Colombia in Bogot√° in 1993, and later that year ran a successful campaign for mayor. He proceeded to preside over Bogot√° as mayor for two (non-consecutive) terms, during which he became known for springing surprising and humorous initiatives upon the city's inhabitants. These tended to involve grand gestures, including local artists or personal appearances by the mayor himself‚Äîtaking a shower in a commercial about conserving water, or walking the streets dressed in spandex and a cape as Supercitizen. On 4 March 2010, he was elected in a public consultation as the Colombian Green Party candidate for the presidential election in 2010. On 4 April 2010, Antanas Mockus chose Sergio Fajardo, former mayor of Medell√≠n, as his vice-presidential running mate. On 9 April 2010 he announced that he had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. He told La W radio: \\"The prediction is that this will not affect my mental activities. I think it is absolutely fitting to tell the people about the diagnosis and about the prognosis‚Äîwhich is 12 years or more of normal life thanks to medication.\\" Mockus finished second in the polling, leading to a runoff election with Juan Manuel Santos, which Santos won. Mockus resigned from the Green Party in June 2011 because he opposed its Bogot√° mayoral candidate being supported by former right-wing President √Ålvaro Uribe. He became Senator of the Republic of Colombia in July 2018, after being the second candidate with the most votes in the legislative elections held on March 11, 2018. He is also the president of the Corporaci√≥n Visionarios por Colombia (Corpovisionarios), center of thought and non-profit action that investigates, advises, designs and implements actions to achieve voluntary changes in collective behavior. ==Early life and career== Mockus was born in Bogot√°. He holds a 1972 Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics from the University of Burgundy in Dijon, France and a 1988 Master of Arts degree in philosophy from the National University of Colombia. He has been a professor and researcher at the university since 1975 and has served as its vice president (1988‚Äì1991) and president (1991‚Äì1993). As its president, he contributed to the formulation of the Colombian Constitution of 1991, focusing on educational issues. In a notable 1993 incident, when confronted with a disruptive group of students, he mooned them. He later explained his action by saying \\"Innovative behavior can be useful when you run out of words\\", and linked it to philosopher Pierre Bourdieu's concept of \\"symbolic violence.\\" He resigned as University president during the aftermath but gained a higher public profile that benefited his subsequent run for the mayorship. ==Bogot√° mayorship== In 1995 he was elected Mayor of Bogot√°. Under Mockus's leadership, Bogot√° saw improvements such as: water usage dropped 40%, 7000 community security groups were formed and the homicide rate fell 70%, traffic fatalities dropped by over 50%, drinking water was provided to all homes (up from 79% in 1993), and sewerage was provided to 95% of homes (up from 71%). When he asked residents to pay a voluntary extra 10% in taxes, 63,000 people did so. His market-oriented social policies were much less successful. Poverty and unemployment levels were high throughout his tenures and continue to be a pressing issue in Bogot√°'s social life. Mockus in 2008 Famous initiatives included hiring 420 mimes to make fun of traffic violators, because he believed Colombians were more afraid of being ridiculed than fined. He also put in place one \\"Night Without Men\\",la noche sin hombres on which the city's men were asked to stay home for an evening to look after the house and the children while the women went out. The city sponsored free open-air concerts, bars offered women-only specials, Ciclovia and the city's women police were in charge of keeping the peace. Amassing political support mainly from Bogot√°'s middle and upper classes, he has been much less successful attracting voters in the national level. During Mockus' unsuccessful presidential bid in 1998, Enrique Pe√±alosa replaced him as mayor. Pe√±alosa worked in a similar way instituting popular new bike paths and bus systems. When Mockus ran again for the 2001 mayorship, he held a ceremony in a public fountain \\"to ask forgiveness for leaving the mayor's office in an unsuccessful bid for the presidency.\\" The impact of Mockus and Pe√±alosa on the development of Bogot√° is described in a documentary film released in October 2009 with the title CITIES ON SPEED ‚Äì Bogot√° Change. In 2003 Mockus stepped down as mayor, to be replaced by Luis Eduardo Garz√≥n, and took a year's sabbatical, traveling and speaking around the world. He planned to return to teaching at National University of Colombia the following year, although he said he was \\"considering the possibility of launching a presidential campaign\\". After spending two weeks as a visiting fellow at the Harvard's Kennedy School of Government in the United States in 2004, \\"to share lessons about civic engagement with students and faculty\\", Mockus returned to Harvard as a Visiting Professor of Romance Languages and Literatures to teach two Spanish classes during the Fall 2004‚Äì2005 semester. In November, Mockus made a special trip to the University of Virginia to speak about the use of positive social mechanisms in relation to his tenure as the mayor of Bogot√°. In 2004 Lithuanian worldwide daily Draugas chose Mockus as Lithuanian of the Year. In October 2004 he visited the Lithuanian community in Chicago, Illinois, which is the biggest Lithuanian community outside the Republic of Lithuania, and delivered a speech in his native Lithuanian language. He is currently the President of Corpovisionarios, an organization that consults to cities about addressing their problems through the same policy methodology that was so successful during his terms as Mayor of Bogot√°. ==Presidential bids== Antanas Mockus and Sergio Fajardo In between his two terms as mayor, Mockus ran an unsuccessful 1998 bid for the presidency, first in his own name and later as Noem√≠ San√≠n Posada's running mate. Mockus ran in the 2006 presidential election as a member of the Indigenous Social Alliance Movement. He finished fourth in the election, attracting 1.24% of the vote. In August 2009, Mockus and two other past mayors of Bogot√° (Enrique Pe√±alosa and Luis Eduardo Garz√≥n) joined a new political movement, Colombian Green Party and decided that one of them would run for office in the 2010 Colombian presidential elections. Mockus, Pe√±alosa and Garz√≥n embarked on an innovative campaign, in which they acknowledged and honored each other's qualifications and preparedness for the job, and telling people to choose whomever they liked best. Through a popular consultation carried on 14 March 2010, which he won by a large margin, Mockus became the Colombian Green Party presidential candidate. On 4 April 2010, Antanas Mockus chose Medell√≠n's former mayor Sergio Fajardo as his running mate, unifying two groups at the center of the political spectrum. Mockus finished second in the first round of voting, with 21.5% of the vote, qualifying him to participate in a runoff election with Juan Manuel Santos, which Mockus lost decisively with 27.5% of the vote. Antanas Mockus left the Green Party in 2011. ==Footnotes== ==External links== * Partido Verde (Green Party, Colombia) Category:1952 births Category:Living people Category:Politicians from Bogot√° Category:Colombian people of Lithuanian descent Category:National University of Colombia alumni Category:National University of Colombia faculty Category:University of Paris alumni Category:Mayors of Bogot√° Category:Green Alliance (Colombia) politicians Category:Yes Colombia politicians Category:Colombian philosophers Category:Colombian mathematicians Category:Colombian Roman Catholics ","title":"Antanas Mockus"},{"id":"525902","text":"Bunratty Castle () is a large 15th-century tower house in County Clare, Ireland. It is located in the centre of Bunratty village (), by the N18 road between Limerick and Ennis, near Shannon Town and its airport. The castle and the adjoining folk park are run by Shannon Heritage as tourist attractions. ==Name== The name Bunratty, Bun Raite (or possibly, Bun na Raite) in Irish, means \\"river basin\\" of the 'Ratty' river. This river, alongside the castle, flows into the nearby Shannon estuary. ===Earlier structures=== An Irish language plaque at Bunratty Castle Bunratty Castle Plaque in English The first recorded settlement at the site may have been a Norsemen settlement/trading camp reported in the Annals of the Four Masters to have been destroyed by Brian Boru in 977. According to local tradition, such a camp was located on a rise south-west of the current castle. However, since no actual remains of this settlement have yet been found, its exact location is unknown and its existence is not proven. Around 1250, King Henry III of England granted the cantred or district of Tradraighe (or Tradree) to Robert De Muscegros, who in 1251 cut down around 200 trees in the King's wood at Cratloe. These may have been used to construct a motte and bailey castle, which would have been the first castle at Bunratty, but again the exact position of this is unknown. A later reference in the state papers, dating to 1253 gives de Muscegros the right to hold markets and an annual fair at Bunratty. It has thus been assumed that the site was the centre of early Norman control in south-eastern Clare. Early 19th-century scholars put the structure to the north-west of the current castle. However, when a hotel was constructed there in 1959, John Hunt excavated the area and thought the remains to be that of a gun emplacement from the Confederate Wars (see below). solar in Bunratty Castle These lands were later handed back to (or taken back by) King Henry III and granted to Thomas De Clare, a descendant of Strongbow in 1276. De Clare built the first stone structure on the site (the second castle). This castle was occupied from ca. 1278 to 1318 and consisted of a large single stone tower with lime white walls. It stood close to the river, on or near the site of the present Bunratty Castle. In the late 13th century, Bunratty had about 1,000 inhabitants. The castle was attacked several times by the O'Briens (or O'Brians) and their allies. In 1284, while De Clare was away in England, the site was captured and destroyed. On his return, in 1287, De Clare had the site rebuilt and a long fosse built around it. The castle was again attacked but it did not fall until 1318. In that year a major battle was fought at Dysert O'Dea as part of the Irish Bruce Wars, in which both Thomas De Clare and his son Richard were killed. Lady De Clare, on learning this, fled from Bunratty to Limerick after burning castle and town. The De Clare family never returned to the area and the remains of the castle eventually collapsed. As the stones were likely used for other local construction works, no traces remain of this second castle. In the 14th century, Limerick was an important port for the English Crown. To guard access via the Shannon estuary against attacks from the Irish, the site was once again occupied. In 1353, Sir Thomas de Rokeby led an English army to conquer the MacNamaras and MacCarthys. A new castle (the third) was built at Bunratty, but once again, its exact location is unknown. Local tradition holds that it stood at the site where the Bunratty Castle Hotel was later constructed. However, the new structure was hardly finished before being captured by the Irish. Documents show that in 1355, King Edward III of England released Thomas Fitzjohn Fitzmaurice from prison in Limerick. He had been charged with letting the castle fall into the hands of Murtough O‚ÄôBrien whilst serving as a Governor (Captain) of Bunratty. ===Current structure=== The fourth castle, the present structure, was built by the MacNamara family after around 1425. Its builder may have been one Maccon Sioda MacNamara, chieftain of Clann Cuilein (i.e. the MacNamaras). He died before the castle was completed which happened under his son Sean Finn (died in 1467). At around 1500, Bunratty Castle came into the hands of the O'Briens (or O'Brians), the most powerful clan in Munster and later Earls of Thomond. They expanded the site and eventually made it their chief seat, moving it there from Ennis. In 1558, the castle‚Äînow noted as one of the principal strongholds of Thomond‚Äîwas taken by Thomas Radclyffe, the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland from Donal O'Brien of Duagh, last King of Thomond (died 1579), and given to Donal's nephew, Connor O'Brien. Donogh O'Brien, Conor's son, may have been the one to move the seat of the family from Clonroad (Ennis) to Bunratty. He made various improvements to the castle including putting a new lead roof on it. During the Confederate Wars set off by the Irish Rebellion of 1641, Lord Forbes, commanding forces of the English Long Parliament, was allowed by the then Lord Barnabas O'Brien to occupy Bunratty in 1646. Barnabas did not want to commit to either side in the struggle, playing off royalists, rebels and roundheads against each other. He left for England, where he joined King Charles. Defence of the castle, whose position allowed those holding it to blockade maritime access to Limerick (held by the Confederates) and the river Shannon, was in the hands of Rear-Admiral Penn, the father of William Penn, founder of Pennsylvania. After a long siege, the Confederates took the castle. Penn surrendered but was allowed to sail away to Kinsale. Barnabas O'Brien died in 1657, but had apparently leased out the castle to one \\"John Cooper\\", likely the same person married to M√°ire n√≠ Mahon of Leamaneh Castle, widow of another O'Brien, Conor (died 1651). Bunratty Castle remained property of the O'Briens and in the 1680s the castle was still the principal seat of the Earls of Thomond. In 1712, Henry, the 8th and last Earl of Thomond (1688‚Äì1741) sold Bunratty Castle and of land to Thomas Amory for ¬£225 and an annual rent of ¬£120. Amory in turn sold the castle to Thomas Studdert who moved in ca. 1720. The Studdert family left the castle (allowing it to fall into disrepair), to reside in the more comfortable and modern adjacent \\"Bunratty House\\" they had built in 1804. For some time in the mid-19th century, the castle was used as a barracks by the Royal Irish Constabulary. In 1894, Bunratty was once again used by the Studdert family, as the seat of Captain Richard Studdert. In the late 19th century, the roof of the Great Hall collapsed. In 1956, the castle was purchased and restored by the 7th Viscount Gort, with assistance from the Office of Public Works. He reroofed the castle and saved it from ruin. The castle was opened to the public in 1960, sporting furniture, tapestries and works of art dating to around 1600. thumb ==References== ==Bibliography== * Christopher Lynch, Bunratty Castle, Volume 41 of The Irish Heritage Series, Eason 1984, . ==External links== *Shannon Heritage website *A picture showing the castle before its 1950s restoration *National Inventory of Architectural Heritage: Bunratty Castle *National Inventory of Architectural Heritage: Bunratty Bridge *National Inventory of Architectural Heritage: Bunratty House *National Inventory of Architectural Heritage: Bunratty Castle Hotel Category:Castles in County Clare Category:National Monuments in County Clare Category:O'Brien dynasty Category:Museums in County Clare Category:Historic house museums in the Republic of Ireland Category:Open-air museums in the Republic of Ireland ","title":"Bunratty Castle"},{"id":"525905","text":"Adi Kuini Teimumu Vuikaba Speed (23 December 1949 ‚Äì 31 December 2004) was a Fijian chief and politician, who served as Deputy Prime Minister in 1999 and 2000. She was the head girl at Adi Cakobau School in 1968, and went on to graduate from the University of the South Pacific and from the Australian National University in Canberra. She subsequently pursued a career in the Public Relations Office, which later became the Ministry of Information. On behalf of the Fiji Public Service Association, she led several delegations to the United Nations. == Political career == The widow of Fiji Labour Party founder and former Prime Minister Timoci Bavadra, Adi Kuini became the leader of the Labour Party after her husband's death in 1989, but resigned in 1991 to take up residence for a few years in Canberra, Australia. She was succeeded by Mahendra Chaudhry as leader of the Fiji Labour Party. Adi Kuini returned to Fiji in 1994 and became leader of the Fijian Association Party (FAP) in 1998 succeeding the former Finance Minister Josefata Kamikamica. Under her leadership, the FAP won 11 seats in the 71-member House of Representatives in the election of 1999. Forming a coalition with her former party, the Fiji Labour Party Adi Kuini became one of two Deputy Prime Ministers in the coalition government led by Mahendra Chaudhry. The Chaudhry government was deposed on 19 May 2000 in a coup organized by George Speight. After the coup had been put down, she refused to support the possible return of Chaudhry as Prime Minister, however, claiming that Fiji needed a less controversial leader to bring about reconciliation among Fiji's ethnic communities and repair fractured multiracial relations. In poor health following repeated operations on a brain tumor, she contested the elections held to restore democracy in September 2001, but all of her party's candidates were defeated as the ethnic Fijian community rallied around the Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua (SDL) of Laisenia Qarase. Adi Kuini herself lost her Serua-Navosa Open Constituency to the SDL's Pio Wong. == Personal life == Adi Kuini was the daughter of Ratu Aseri Qoro Latianara (1924‚Äì1998), whom she succeeded as Tui Noikoro Paramount Chief of Navosa, and of Lanieta Vuni; she herself was duly succeeded in these roles by her brother, Ratu Tomasi Latianara. Adi Kuini was married three times, first to Military officer Savenaca Draunidalo (a Minister from 2001 to 2006), subsequently to Bavadra and finally to Clive Speed, a former Director of the Business Council of Australia. She had four children (including the well-known lawyer Tupou Draunidalo, who became President of the National Federation Party in 2014 and was subsequently elected to Parliament that year) and eleven stepchildren. By the end of 2004, when she lost a long battle with cancer, she was the grandmother of three. She is buried in Korolevu, a two- hour drive from Sigatoka. Politicians remembered Adi Kuini as a committed Christian and champion of racial tolerance, and as one who fought for reform of the chiefly system by insisting on standards of accountability for all chiefs.

In the Middle Ages and Ancien R√©gime, valet de chambre was a role for junior courtiers and specialists such as artists in a royal court, but the term \\"valet\\" by itself most often refers to a normal servant responsible for the clothes and personal belongings of an employer, and making minor arrangements. In the United States, the term most often refers to a parking valet, and the role is often confused with a butler. == Word origins == In English, valet as \\"personal man-servant\\" is recorded since 1567, though use of the term in the French-speaking English medieval court is older, and the variant form varlet is cited from 1456 (OED). Both are French importations of valet (the \\"t\\" being silent in modern French) or varlet, Old French variants of vaslet \\"man's servant\\", originally \\"squire, young man\\", assumed to be from Gallo-Romance Vulgar Latin *vassellittus \\"young nobleman, squire, page\\", diminutive of Medieval Latin vassallus, from vassus \\"servant\\", possibly cognate to an Old Celtic root wasso- \\"young man, squire\\" (source of Welsh gwas \\"youth, servant\\", Breton goaz \\"servant, vassal, man\\", Irish foss \\"servant\\"). See yeoman, possibly derived from yonge man, a related term. The modern use is usually short for the valet de chambre (French for \\"room valet\\", in modern terms the bedroom, though not originally so), described in the following section. Since the 16th century, the word has traditionally been pronounced as rhyming with pallet, though an alternative pronunciation, rhyming with chalet, as in French, is now common. The Oxford English Dictionary lists both pronunciations as valid. ==Domestic valet== A valet or \\"gentleman's gentleman\\" is a gentleman's male servant; the closest female equivalent is a lady's maid. The valet performs personal services such as maintaining his employer's clothes, running his bath and perhaps (especially in the past) shaving his employer. In a great house, the master of the house had his own valet, and in the very grandest great houses, other adult members of the employing family (e.g. master's sons) would also have their own valets. At a court, even minor princes and high officials may be assigned one, but in a smaller household the butler - the majordomo in charge of the household staff - might have to double as his employer's valet. In a bachelor's household the valet might perform light housekeeping duties as well. Valets learned the skills for their role in various ways. Some began as footmen, learning some relevant skills as part of that job, and picking up others when deputising for their master's valet, or by performing valeting tasks for his sons before they had a valet of their own, or for male guests who did not travel with a valet. Others started out as soldier-servants to army officers (batmen) or stewards to naval officers. Traditionally, a valet did much more than merely lay out clothes and take care of personal items. He was also responsible for making travel arrangements, dealing with any bills and handling all money matters concerning his master or his master's household. Alexandre Bontemps, the most senior of the thirty-six valets to Louis XIV of France, was a powerful figure, who ran the Ch√¢teau de Versailles. In courts, valet de chambre was a position of some status, often given to artists, musicians, poets and others, who generally spent most of their time on their specialized work. The role was also, at least during the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance, a common first step or training period in a nobleman's career at court. Valets, like butlers and most specialized domestic staff, have become relatively rare. A more common, though still infrequent, arrangement is the general servant performing combined roles. ===Famous fictional valets=== Aramis, of The Three Musketeers, was a studious person who later became a lay brother. (Thomas Nicholls carves him brushing his master's clothes whilst studying theology). * Jeeves, created in 1915 by P. G. Wodehouse, starred in a series of stories until Wodehouse's death in 1975; Reginald Jeeves is considered the \\"personification of the perfect valet\\" since 1930, inspired the name of Internet search engine Ask Jeeves, and is now a generic term in dictionaries such as the Oxford English Dictionary. * Mervyn Bunter, created in 1923 by Dorothy L. Sayers in the Lord Peter Wimsey series, likewise a paragon of discreet competence, taking his duties beyond what was expected of a valet to help his master. * Alfred Pennyworth, valet to Bruce Wayne (Batman), created by Don Cameron and Bob Kane in 1943. Played by Alan Napier in the 1960s TV series and 1966 Batman film starring Adam West, Michael Gough in Batman, Batman Returns, Batman Forever and Batman & Robin, Michael Caine in Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, and The Dark Knight Rises, and most recently by Jeremy Irons in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and Justice League. Originally a rotund domestic servant in comic stories, the role of Alfred Pennyworth has evolved to a technical and mechanical aide, highly skilled medic, and occasional wheelman for Batman on his various travels. * Hugo Barrett, in the 1948 Robin Maugham novella, 1958 play and 1963 Joseph Losey film The Servant.

The box is traditionally made from wood, but nowadays often made from plastic. It can be disassembled into three parts: a bottom part, the rectangular walls, and a top part. Before use, the wooden box should be put in water to reduce sticking of the rice. The bottom and top parts can be covered with a layer of plastic foil for easier cleaning. The bottom part and the walls are assembled before the rice and the topping is added. Next, the top part is used to press down on the sushi, hence the name \\"pressed sushi\\". For disassembly, the rectangular walls are pulled up while the top part still presses against the sushi. After removing the top part, the sushi is cut and can be served. A variant of the oshizushihako has half cylindrical shapes cut from the thicker top and bottom parts so that the sushi is pressed in a cylindrical shape.

The word of officer is a working title, not a rank, used in the same way a \\"police officer\\" can also be a sergeant, or in the military, in which non-commissioned personnel may serve as intelligence officers. Organizations which employ intelligence officers include armed forces, police, and customs agencies. ==Sources of intelligence== Intelligence officers make use of a variety of sources of information, including ; Communications intelligence (COMINT): Eavesdropping and interception of communications (e.g., by wiretapping) including signals intelligence (SIGINT) and electronic intelligence (ELINT). ; Financial intelligence (FININT): The gathering of information about the financial affairs of entities of interest. ; Human intelligence (HUMINT): Derived from covert human intelligence sources (CHIS, agents or moles) from a variety of agencies and activities. ; Imagery intelligence (IMINT): Derived from numerous collection assets, such as reconnaissance satellites or aircraft. ; Measurement and signature intelligence (MASINT): Derived from collection assets that collect and evaluate technical profiles and specific characteristics of certain targeted entities. ; Open source intelligence (OSINT): Derived from publicly available sources such as the Internet, library materials, newspapers, etc. ; Technical intelligence (TECHINT): Based on scientific and technical characteristics of weapons systems, technological devices and other entities. Please note, the difference between MASINT and TECHINT is that TECHINT involves analysis of weapons systems in the custody of the organization which commissions such tests, while MASINT involves analysis, or remote sensing, of trace evidence left behind by the weapons systems (unintended emissive byproducts, or \\"trails\\"‚Äîthe spectral, chemical or RF emissions an object leaves behind which serve as distinctive signatures). ==Role and responsibilities== The actual role carried out by an intelligence officer varies depending on the remit of his/her parent organization. Officers of foreign intelligence agencies (e.g. the United States' Central Intelligence Agency, Canada's Canadian Security Intelligence Service ( CSIS), the United Kingdom's Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) and the Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS)) may spend much of their careers abroad. Officers of domestic intelligence agencies (such as the United States' Federal Bureau of Investigation, Canada's RCMP National Security Enforcement Section the UK's Security Service (MI5) and the Australian Security Intelligence Organization (ASIO)) are responsible for counter-terrorism, counter-espionage, counter-proliferation and the detection and prevention of serious organized crime within their own countries (although, in Britain, the National Crime Agency is responsible for dealing with serious organized crime). Titles and responsibilities common among intelligence officers include: ; Field officer: An officer who manages the intelligence collection plan for specific missions in foreign countries. ; Case officer: An officer who runs intelligence agents in order to collect raw intelligence information. Case officers spend their time recruiting and exploiting source agents in order to collect HUMINT. ; Collections officer (collector): An officer who collects information, not necessarily from human sources but from technical sources such as wiretaps, bugs, cyber-collection, MASINT devices, SIGINT devices and other means. ; Operations officer: An officer who plans or enacts the necessary steps to disrupt or prevent activities of hostile individuals or groups. ; Analyst: An officer who analyzes collected information and results of operations to determine the identities, intentions, capabilities and activities of hostile individuals or groups and to determine requirements for future operations. After analysis, analysts are also responsible for the production and dissemination of their final product.U.S. Department of the Treasury, Office of Intelligence and Analysis Brochure, Department of Homeland Security, Deployed Intelligence Officers and Protective Security Advisors, , accessed Jan 8 2013 ; Counterintelligence officer:An officer that works to prevent detection, penetration, manipulation and compromise of the intelligence agency, its operations and overall national security by foreign, domestic, or hostile agents.USAjobs.gov, Counter-Intelligence Officer Job Duties Often counterintelligence officers are law enforcement officers, as is the case with the Special Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Counterintelligence Division and the Diplomatic Security Service's Counterintelligence Division. This is often done in order to arrest moles and foreign intelligence agents. However, counter-intelligence officers can and do actively handle sources and agents in order to collect raw intelligence information. ===Intelligence agents=== Intelligence agents are individuals that work for or have been recruited by an Intelligence Officer, but who are not employed by the intelligence agency of the intelligence officer. Sometime around 2000, the United States Intelligence Community adopted a more \\"corporate\\" vocabulary and began referring to agents as assets.Ishmael Jones, The Human Factor: Inside the CIA's Dysfunctional Intelligence Culture, 2008 Intelligence agents can be of several types: ; Source agent: A primary source of intelligence information. This is the classic HUMINT source. ; Access agent: An agent who identifies and approaches potential sources (eventual source agents) for assessment or recruitment. In counter-proliferation (CP) access agents are often scientists. In counter-terrorism (CT) access agents are often religious or ideological leaders. ; Agent provocateur: An agent who infiltrates hostile organizations with the intent of spreading disinformation from within or disrupting their operations through enticement and sabotage. ; Rogue agent: A former intelligence officer, who may be subject to a burn notice, who is no longer accepting direction from his/her agency. ; Double agent: An agent or intelligence officer who accepts direction from two or more intelligence agencies. Known as triple agents when the number of directing agencies is three. Contrary to popular belief or what is seen in Hollywood films, professionally trained intelligence officers are never referred to as agents, secret agents or special agents, (except in the case of FBI Special Agents). They are most often referred to as case officers or operations officers. Agents are the foreigners who betray their own countries to pass information to the officer; agents are also known as confidential informants or assets. ==See also== * Intelligence agency * Espionage ==References== Category:Spies by role Intelligence officer Category:Government occupations ","title":"Intelligence officer"},{"id":"525928","text":"A special agent is an investigator or detective for a governmental or independent agency, who primarily serves in criminal investigatory positions. Additionally, many federal and state \\"special agents\\" operate in \\"criminal intelligence\\" based roles as well. Within the U.S. federal law enforcement system, dozens of federal agencies employ federal law enforcement officers, each with different criteria pertaining to the use of the titles Special Agent and Agent. In federal/military intelligence usage, \\"agent\\" also refers to a human source or human \\"asset\\" who is recruited, trained, controlled, and employed to obtain and report information.North Atlantic Treaty Organization, NATO Standardization Agency AAP-6 - Glossary of terms and definitions, p. 47. Within law enforcement agencies, these types of sources are often referred to as informants, confidential informants (CI-not to be confused with counterintelligence) or confidential human sources (CHS). In general, some agents are federal law enforcement officers and hold either arrest authority or the right to conduct minor criminal/non-criminal investigations. In some agencies, however, a special agent may have both criminal and non-criminal investigatory authority but still have no authority to conduct major criminal investigations. Regardless, most people holding the title of \\"special agent\\" are law enforcement officers under state or federal law (with some also being dual intelligence operatives such as with the FBI). These law enforcement officers are distinctly empowered to conduct both major and minor criminal investigations, and hold arrest authority. Additionally, most special agents are authorized to carry firearms both on and off duty due to their status as law enforcement officers. In US federal law enforcement, the title of \\"special agent\\" is used almost exclusively for federal and military criminal investigators only. ==Federal government== Within the U.S. government, the title of special agent designates a general investigator in the GS-1810 job series, criminal investigator in the GS-1811 job series or a counterintelligence operations specialist in the GS-0132 job series according to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) handbook. Special agents typically have an undergraduate degree. * 1810: General Investigator * 1811: Criminal Investigator ===Federal agencies=== Most federal agencies, including the following, employ some type of special agent, investigator or background investigator: * Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) **Office of Inspector General of the CIA * Department of Agriculture (USDA) ** United States Forest Service Office of Law Enforcement and Investigations ** Office of Inspector General (USDA-OIG) * Department of Commerce (USDOC) ** National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) **Office of Security (OSY) ** Office of Export Enforcement (OEE) * Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) ** Food and Drug Administration (FDA) *** FDA Office of Criminal Investigations (OCI) ** Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG) * Department of Education (ED) ** Office of Inspector General (ED-OIG) * Department of Homeland Security (DHS) **Coast Guard Investigative Service (CGIS) ** Citizenship and Immigration Services (CIS) ** Customs and Border Protection (CBP) ** Federal Protective Service (FPS) ** Immigration and Customs Enforcement / Homeland Security Investigations (ICE/HSI) **Office of Inspector General (DHS-OIG) ** Transportation Security Administration (TSA) ** United States Secret Service (USSS) * Department of the Interior (DOI) ** Bureau of Indian Affairs Police (BIA) ** Bureau of Land Management (BLM) ** United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) ** United States Park Police (USPP) ** National Park Service (NPS) ** Office of Inspector General (DOI-OIG) * United States Department of Labor Office of Inspector General (DOL-OIG) * Department of Defense (DOD) **Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) **Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) **Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) **Defense Logistics Agency Office of Inspector General (DLA OIG) **National Security Agency (NSA) **Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) **Office of Inspector General (DOD-OIG) ***Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS) **Pentagon Force Protection Agency (PFPA) **United States Army Counterintelligence (Army CI) **United States Army Criminal Investigation Command (USACIDC) **United States Marine Corps Criminal Investigation Division (Marine CID Agent) * United States Department of Energy (DOE) - National Nuclear Security Administration * United States Office of Personnel Management **Office of Inspector General (OPM-OIG) * Department of Justice (DOJ) ** Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) ** Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) ** Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) ** Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) ** Office of Inspector General (DOJ-OIG) ** United States Marshals Service (USMS) * Department of State ** Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) (FS-2501) ** Office of Inspector General (DOS-OIG) * Department of Transportation (DOT) ** Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) ** Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) ** Office of Inspector General for the Department of Transportation (DOT-OIG) * Department of the Treasury ** Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) ** Bureau of Engraving and Printing Police ** Federal Reserve Board Police ** IRS Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) ** Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) ** United States Mint Police * National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) **Office of Inspector General **Office of Protective Services *Postal Service (USPS) **United States Postal Inspection Service (USPIS ‚Äì not an Inspector General) **United States Postal Service Office of Inspector General (USPS-OIG) * United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ** Criminal Investigation Division ** Office of Inspector General (EPA-OIG) * Other ** All 64 federal Offices of Inspector General (OIG) ===Training for the federal criminal investigator=== Federal law enforcement training can be divided into various categories, the most common being basic, agency-specific basic (ASB), advanced/specialized, and agency-advanced/specialized. To operate safely and effectively, U.S. special agents and criminal investigators must possess skills and knowledge regarding criminal and civil law and procedure, enforcement operations, physical techniques, and technical equipment, to mention a few. They must also be physically fit. While possession of a college degree can aid in obtaining employment in this profession, only extensive training provided at specialized facilities, combined with on-the-job training, can provide the skills and knowledge needed to perform the duties of a federal criminal investigator. As of 2012, there were 13,913 FBI agents, as of 2016, there were approximately 6,500 ICE-Homeland Security investigations (HSI) agents, and as of 2011, there were 4,890 DEA agents in the United States. Most U.S. special agents and federal criminal investigators receive their basic training at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers (FLETC), including HSI, ATF, IRS-CI, USMS, USSS, DSS, AFOSI, NCIS and OIGs. FLETC has facilities in Brunswick (Glynco), GA, Artesia, NM, Charleston, SC, and Cheltenham, MD. Only DEA and FBI agents receive their basic training at Quantico. The FBI and DEA operate completely self-contained academies that provide all levels of training to their agents. These academies make no distinction between basic and agency-specific basic training. New FBI and DEA agents train at their academies for approximately five months before they begin their first investigative assignment. Both agencies' academies also provide advanced training in various subjects to other federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security's FLETC, commonly pronounced \\"flet-see\\", is a consolidated training facility that provides basic and advanced training to the vast majority of U.S. special agents and other federal law enforcement personnel. The FLETC also provides advanced and specialized training for most federal, state, local, tribal and non-U.S. law enforcement agencies willing to share in the cost. The FLETC's basic training course for special agents, the Criminal Investigator Training Program (CITP), lasts about thirteen weeks, and may be given to persons if required for self-protection, depending on changes to program content or holidays. Nevertheless, CITP only represents the beginning or basic training received by U.S. special agents not employed by the FBI, federal air marshals, DEA, or USPIS. After completing the FLETC CITP, most agents immediately transition to training provided by their own agencies (hence the term agency-specific basic, or ASB), lasting another two to sixteen weeks and sometimes longer, depending on the agency. Some smaller agencies, like the 64 offices of inspector general (OIGs), operate consolidated academies, such as the Inspector General Criminal Investigator Academy (IGCIA), through which specialized but common ASB-type skills and knowledge are more economically taught. So agents employed by the OIGs first attend CITP, then attend the IGCIA's IG Investigator Training Program (IGITP), then attend their own agencies' ASB training after completing IGITP, receiving a total of up to sixteen weeks or more of training before conducting their first investigation. Many of the agencies utilizing FLETC maintain their individual academies for providing ASB and agency-specific advanced training on the same grounds as FLETC and share use of the same facilities. Some agencies, such as the U.S. Department of State's Diplomatic Security Service and the U.S. Secret Service, conduct their ASB training in separate agency-owned and operated facilities. Although a much smaller agency than the FBI or DEA, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service also operates a self-contained federal law enforcement training academy called the Career Development Division (CDD). Like FLETC and Quantico, USPIS CDD has been fully accredited by the Federal Law Enforcement Training Accreditation (FLETA). Like the other academies, CDD provides basic training to postal inspectors in firearms, legal use of force, driving training, crime scene management, controlled deliveries, felony arrests, case management, case development, informant management, and surveillance, but also incorporates agency-specific basic training to help prepare the USPIS candidates in enforcing postal laws and federal mail statutes such as mail fraud, mail theft, and other mail related crimes. In addition to basic training, CDD also provides advanced training for the postal inspectors, the uniformed postal police personnel, and the analysts. For all U.S. special agents, training does not stop after basic and ASB. The career of a federal special agent is one of regular training in new legal issues and investigative techniques, and frequently includes quarterly, if not monthly, refresher training in hand-to-hand defensive tactics, the use of weapons of less than lethal force, and regular qualification in the use of firearms. ===Criminal investigators and the use of the term special agent=== Not all federal criminal investigators are called special agents. Some federal agencies entitle their investigators as criminal investigators but use the term interchangeably with special agent. Other federal agencies use different titles for the same 1811 criminal investigative job series. Series 1811 criminal investigators for the U.S. marshals are entitled deputy marshals. Series 1811 criminal investigators for the U.S Postal Inspection Service are called postal inspectors. These inspectors were originally called surveyors and received a title change in 1801 to special agent. In 1880, the U.S. Congress created the position of Chief Postal Inspector and renamed these special agents to postal inspectors. The first special agents in the United States were appointed in 1791 when the Secretary of the Treasury was authorized to employ \\"special agents\\" for the purpose of examining the accounts and books of the Collectors of Customs. The position of Special Treasury Agent was created, and until 1860 submitted reports to the Department of Treasury, through the Collectors of Customs in the Customs District in which they were employed. ===Other titles=== The titles special agent and secret agent are not synonymous. The title special agent is commonly the official title assigned to individuals employed in that capacity, especially by the U.S. agencies described above (and for the reasons described below), whereas secret agent is less of an official title, but is used to describe individuals employed or engaged in espionage. Special agents, like state, county, and municipal law enforcement officers, can, at various times, engage in secret or undercover activities as part of investigative operations, or counter-espionage assignments, during which they might be referred to as undercover agents. They may also be referred to, or refer to themselves, as criminal investigators, federal agents, U.S. Agents, U.S special agents, U.S. federal agents, agents, federal authorities, federal officers, or federal investigators. At the management level, the head of a region or office might be called a special agent in charge, abbreviated as an SAC or SAIC. The Deputy Special Agent in Charge (DSAC), acts as the operational manager for investigations and typically supervises Assistant Special Agents in Charge (ASACs). First line supervisors may be called simply Supervisory Special Agent, Assistant to the Special Agent in Charge (ATSAIC) or Group Supervisors. Assistant Special Agent in Charge, abbreviated as ASAC, are second line supervisors. In the FBI, the offices in Washington DC, New York City and Los Angeles are overseen by Assistant Directors in Charge (ADIC) due to their large size. ===Jurisdictional issues=== Exactly which U.S. special agents have the broadest authority is a matter of debate. The issue of concurrent jurisdiction (in which multiple agencies have non-exclusive jurisdiction over a given set of the U.S. Code, such as the FBI, HSI and DEA in respect to drug laws) does not make the issue clearer. However, special agents of many agencies can often enforce Title 18 (general criminal code) of the US Code included in their agency specific duties. Some U.S. special agents have a larger number of titles, or just different titles, to enforce and with those titles sometimes include unique authorities. The following are some examples of unique authorities that agency-specific special agents possess: Administrative subpoena powers. Department of Defense and any military special agents are authorized to enforce the UCMJ. Title 19 designation authorizes HSI special agents, CBP officers, Border Patrol Agents to perform border searches, which require no suspicion or warrant. Some agencies have been designated lead agency by the Attorney General over particular types of investigations. The FBI usually is the lead in public corruption cases involving elected government officials. In another instance, HSI is normally the lead agency in matters with an articulable nexus to the U.S. border, including weapons and narcotics smuggling; financial crimes, money laundering and bulk cash smuggling; human trafficking or smuggling; counter-terrorism; counter proliferation; cybercrime; transnational gang activity; commercial fraud and intellectual property theft; human rights violations; immigration, document and benefit fraud; international art and antiquity theft; and import/export violations. Many exclusive jurisdictions also exist. In these cases, only one criminal investigative agency is authorized or assigned jurisdiction over a particular Title or type of investigation. Special agents of the ATF, DSS, DEA, FBI, IRS-CI, ICE-Homeland Security Investigations, USSS and USMS not only have the power to enforce the General Criminal Code (Title 18), but also applicable state and local laws if authorized by the state in which they are operating. Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS), United States Army Criminal Investigation Command (CID), United States Army Counterintelligence, Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS), and U.S. Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) special agents not only investigate statutes within the United States Code and state and local laws with a nexus to their branch, but are also tasked with enforcing the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), a jurisdiction not held by most of the larger federal agencies. All DCIS, USACIDC, Army Counterintelligence, NCIS, and AFOSI special agents enjoy statutory law enforcement authority, although civilian and military agents derive their principal arrest authority from different federal statutes. Other special agents, such as those employed by the National Park Service, have jurisdiction over crimes committed within the boundaries of or have a nexus to the lands managed by their agency or department only. Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) special agents have administrative arrest powers under the Immigration and Nationality Act. They can administratively arrest and detain aliens for violations of United States immigration laws pending federal removal (deportation) proceedings. HSI special agents can also seize merchandise and articles introduced into the United States contrary to U.S. laws under Title 19 of the United States Code. Certain active-duty special agents employed by the military have broad authority, when the nexus of the violation they are investigating occurred on military-controlled areas or there is a military connection. ===U.S. railroads=== All of the major Class I railroads, most regional carriers, and some local railways employ their own police departments whose officers carry the title special agent. Railroad special agents are commissioned by the governor or other agency of the state they are employed in, are armed, and carry state arrest powers in all states in which their employing railroad owns property, if authorized by the state. Their primary concern is policing crimes against the railroad, although they sometimes have the authority to police the general public, make arrests on public property, and enforce applicable local, state, or federal laws when necessary. The BNSF Police Department, Union Pacific Police Department, and Amtrak Police, among other departments, all utilize the rank/title of \\"Special Agent\\". Railroad police and the term special agent, along with the Pinkerton Detective Agency, were models for the FBI when it was created in 1907. ==State, county, municipal, and tribal governments== A state or municipal criminal investigator can also be titled as a \\"special agent\\" if labeled as such by their employing agency. Most commonly this title is seen within the state bureaus of investigation (SBI) which operate as a state-level detective agency/bureau for one of the 50 U.S. states. Some examples of SBI's with \\"special agents\\" include the California Department of Justice / California Bureau of Investigation, Alabama Department of Public Safety's Alabama Bureau of Investigation, Illinois Department of Revenue's Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, Ohio Attorney General's Office, Iowa Department of Public Safety, Virginia Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control Bureau of Law Enforcement, Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. Additionally, the Virginia State Police has investigators who are Special Agents, which conduct investigations into a broad range of matters and has Special Agents assigned to the Executive Protection unit the protects the sitting Governor. VSP also has Trooper Agents, which are persons who are front line Troopers with marked police vehicles but are also Special Agents. Several Native American tribes also employ what they refer to as \\"special agents\\" which include criminal investigators, court investigators, or gaming investigators, and some are deputized as special federal officers of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. ==In popular culture== Special agents, particularly those within the FBI, have been depicted in popular entertainment for years. The title \\"assistant special agent in charge\\" and its acronym \\"ASAC\\" are stated frequently throughout the TV series Breaking Bad. For example, in Season 1 through Season 4, both Hank Schrader and Gus Fring are shown to be friendly with Hank's boss, ASAC George Merkert, and in Season 4 Episode 12 \\"End Times\\", Steve Gomez tells Dennis the \\"ASAC\\" is being pressured to search Gus's laundry for drugs. In Season 5, Hank ‚Äì who is proud to have been promoted to the job vacated by his ousted boss ‚Äì repeatedly chants \\"ASAC Schrader\\" to his baby niece Holly. In the TV series White Collar, Peter Burke is the \\"Special Agent in Charge\\" (promoted from assistant special agent in charge at the end of Season 6) and the head of the Manhattan White Collar Division. In the TV series Criminal Minds several of the Behavioral Analysis Unit members are Supervisory Special Agents. In the TV series The X Files, the title \\"special agent\\" is given to both Fox Mulder and Dana Scully of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The title is referenced by them numerous times throughout each episode. The main character from the TV series Twin Peaks, is FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper, and also, other FBI special agents make numerous cameos throughout the series, and its prequel movie, Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me. \\"Dick Barton - Special Agent\\" was the subject of radio programs (in the 1940s) and later TV and film productions. ==See also== * List of United States federal law enforcement agencies * Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives * Detective * Diplomatic Security Service, U.S. Department of State * Drug Enforcement Administration * Federal Bureau of Investigation * Inspector * Investigator (disambiguation) * IRS Criminal Investigation * Law enforcement agency * Police rank * Society of Former Special Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation * State bureau of investigation * State police * U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement * United States Marshals Service * United States Secret Service ==References== Category:American law enforcement officials Category:Detectives and criminal investigators Category:Legal professions Category:Police ranks Category:Law enforcement occupations Category:Positions of authority ","title":"Special agent"},{"id":"525929","text":"Marina Golbahari (born 1989) is an Afghan actress who earned international fame for her role as the title character in the 2003 film Osama, playing a girl who had to dress and act as a boy to support her family during the Taliban years. ==Career== She was cast as Osama by the Afghan film director Siddiq Barmak, who picked her roaming on the streets of Kabul as a beggar.

In contrast to previous airline transaction processing systems, the most notable aspect of ACP is that it was designed to run on most models of the IBM System/360 mainframe computer family. This departed from the earlier model in which each airline had a different, machine-specific transaction system. ==Overview== Development began with SABRE (Semi-Automatic Business Research Environment), Deltamatic, and PANAMAC. From these Programmed Airline Reservations System (PARS) was developed. In 1969 the control program, ACP was separated from PARS; PARS keeping the functions for processing airline reservations and related data. In December 1979, ACP became known as ACP/TPF and then just TPF (Transaction Processing Facility) as the transaction operating system became more widely implemented by businesses other than the major airlines, such as online credit card processing, hotel and rental car reservations, police emergency response systems, and package delivery systems. The last \\"free\\" release of ACP, 9.2.1, was intended for use in bank card and similar applications. It was shipped on a \\"mini-reel\\" which contained a complete ACP system, and its libraries for restoration to IBM 3340 DASD packs. From that complete system one could easily create derivative works. A hypervisor was included, which allowed OS/370 VS1 or VS2 (SVS or MVS) to be run as a \\"guest\\" OS under ACP itself. The end-user documentation, which was shipped with the tape, took almost 60 linear inches of shelf space.

In the north west of Scotland and northern Wales the highland midge is usually very prevalent from late spring to late summer. Female highland midges are well known for gathering in clouds and biting humans, though the majority of the blood they obtain comes from cattle, sheep and deer. The bite of Culicoides is felt as a sharp prick. It is often followed by irritating lumps that may disappear in a few hours or last for days, depending on the individual. Following Scotland's exceptionally cold winter in the early part of 2010, scientists found that the prolonged freezing conditions, rather than reducing the following summer's midge population in the Scottish Highlands, in fact increased it as the cold weather had reduced the numbers of its natural predators, such as bats and birds. ==Activity== Female midges tend to bite close to their breeding site (although they have been found up to 1 km away) and near to the ground. They are most active just before dawn and sunset but bite at any time of day. Midges are less active with wind speeds of over , or humidity below 60‚Äì75%. Dry cloudless conditions are unfavourable to midges, thus they are prevalent in humid, wet and cloudy conditions. Rain does not deter them, nor does darkness. However, they tend not to go into houses or buildings, but will enter tents. == References == ==Further reading== * Hendry, George.

Formerly a member of the Quebec Liberal Party, Ren√© L√©vesque quit the party with a few hundred others after his proposal of a sovereign Quebec associated to the rest of Canada was rejected during a party convention. The MSA quickly began to move for a merger of all the independence movements in Quebec, which at the time were the Rassemblement pour l'ind√©pendance nationale (RIN) and the Ralliement national (RN). In January 1968, the MSA published the manifesto Option Qu√©bec. From April 19 to 21, it held its first Congr√®s d'orientation with its 7300 members. The convention led to the publication of a groundwork document entitled Ce pays qu'on peut b√¢tir (This country that we can build) and the decision to create a new political party dedicated to Sovereignty-Association. From October 11 to 14, the MSA held its first national congress in Quebec City. The merger of the MSA and the RN created the Parti Qu√©b√©cois (PQ). MSA leader Ren√© L√©vesque was elected president of the PQ, and RN leader Gilles Gr√©goire became vice-president. On October 26 Pierre Bourgault, leader of the RIN, dissolved the party and invited its members to join the PQ. The short-lived MSA had served its purpose: sovereigntist forces in Quebec were united under a single party.

It is commonly seen as a late manifestation of heart failure, resulting from fluid redistribution into the central circulation, causing an increase in pulmonary capillary pressure. It is also seen in cases of abdominal obesity or pulmonary disease.Anthony Fauci, Eugene Braunwald, Dennis Kasper, Stephen Hauser, Dan Longo, J. Jameson, Joseph Loscalzo, (2008). Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 17th ed. McGraw-Hill. . p.1446 Orthopnea is the opposite of platypnea, shortness of breath that worsens when sitting or standing up. ==Causes== Orthopnea is often a symptom of left ventricular heart failure and/or pulmonary edema. It can also occur in those with asthma and chronic bronchitis, as well as those with sleep apnea or panic disorder. It is also associated with polycystic liver disease. From a neuromuscular perspective, orthopnea is a sign of severe diaphragmatic weakness. Under such circumstances, patients may describe shortness of breath when they bend over (e.g. when tying shoelaces).. ==Mechanism== Orthopnea is due to increased distribution of blood to the pulmonary circulation when a person lies flat or closer to a horizontal position. Lying flat decreases the inhibitory effect that the gravity usually has on the blood that is coming back to the heart from the lower extremities of the body. This increases the right sided venous return. In a normal person, this redistribution of blood has little effect on respiratory function as the left ventricle has the adequate capacity to suddenly increase its stroke volume (as a result of Frank-Starling mechanism). In a person with heart failure, the left ventricle has an inadequate capacity to respond to increased arrival of blood from the pulmonary circulation. This leads to the pooling up of blood in the pulmonary circulation. The increased intra-parenchymal pulmonary intravascular pressure can also result in hydrostatic pressure related fluid exudation into the alveoli, thus causing pulmonary edema and further worsening shortness of breath. Thus, shortness of breath is commonly experienced after a reasonably short time lying near to flat for a person with left ventricular failure. This is different from the dyspnea experienced by someone with lung parenchymal pathology (both restrictive and obstructive) when lying down, which is sudden and instead related to an acute change in diaphragmatic/accessory respiratory muscle mechanical advantage lost when moving the body into a more horizontal position. ==Diagnosis== Diagnosis is based mostly on the clinical features. ==Treatment== Treating the underlying cause will serve the purpose. ==Etymology == The word orthopnea uses combining forms of ortho- + -pnea, from Greek ortho, straight, regular, + pnoia, breath.

This results in the leg being shortened and the development of a limp. It may be congenital and is commonly caused by injury, such as a fracture. It can also occur when the bone tissue in the neck of the femur is softer than normal, causing it to bend under the weight of the body. This may either be congenital or the result of a bone disorder. The most common cause of coxa vara is either congenital or developmental. Other common causes include metabolic bone diseases (e.g. Paget's disease of bone), post-Perthes deformity, osteomyelitis, and post traumatic (due to improper healing of a fracture between the greater and lesser trochanter). Shepherd's Crook deformity is a severe form of coxa vara where the proximal femur is severely deformed with a reduction in the neck shaft angle beyond 90 degrees. It is most commonly a sequela of osteogenesis imperfecta, Pagets disease, osteomyelitis, tumour and tumour-like conditions (e.g. fibrous dysplasia). Coxa vara can happen in cleidocranial dysostosis. ==Anatomy== In early skeletal development, a common physis serves the greater trochanter and the capital femoral epiphysis. This physis divides as growth continues in a balance that favors the capital epiphysis and creates a normal neck shaft angle (angle between the femoral shaft and the neck). The corresponding angle at maturity is 135 ¬± 7 degrees. Another angle used for the measurement of coxa vara is the cervicofemoral angle which is approximately 35 degrees at infancy and increases to 45 degrees after maturity. ==TypesDevelopmental=== * primary defect in endochondral ossification of the medial part of the femoral neck (Most common cause) * Excessive interuterine pressure on the developing fetal hip * vascular insult * Faulty maturation of the cartilage and metaphyseal bone of the femoral neck Clinical feature: presents after the child has started walking but before six years of age. Usually associated with a painless hip due to mild abductor weakness and mild limb length discrepancy. If there is a bilateral involvement the child might have a waddling gait or trendelenburg gait with an increased lumbar lordosis. The greater trochanter is usually prominent on palpation and is more proximal. Restricted abduction and internal rotation. X-ray: decreased neck shaft angle, increased cervicofemoral angle, vertical physis, shortened femoral neck decrease in femoral anteversion. HE angle (Hilgenriener epiphyseal angle- angle subtended between a horizontal line connecting the triradiate cartilage and the epiphysis); normal angle is <30 degrees. Treatment: HE angle of 45‚Äì60 degrees: observation and periodic follow up. Indication for surgery: HE angle more than 60 degrees, progressive deformity, neckshaft angle <90 degrees, development of Trendelenburg gait Surgery: subtrochanteric valgus osteotomy with adequate internal rotation of distal fragment to correct anteversion; common complication is recurrence. If HE angle is reduced to 38 degrees, less evidence of recurrence; post operative spica cast is used for a period of 6‚Äì8 weeks. Coxa vara is also seen in Niemann‚ÄìPick disease. ===Congenital === Presence at birth is extremely rare and associated with other congenital anomalies such as proximal femoral focal deficiency, fibular hemimelia or anomalies in other part of the body such as cleidocranial dyastosis. The femoral deformity is present in the subtrochantric area where the bone is bent. The cortices are thickened and may be associated with overlying skin dimples. External rotation of the femur with valgus deformity of knee may be noted. This condition does not resolve and requires surgical management. Surgical management includes valgus osteotomy to improve hip biomechanics and length and rotational osteotomy to correct retroversion and lengthening. ==See also== *Coxa valga *Genu valgus ==References== * S.Swischuk, S.John: Differential Diagnosis in Pediatric Radiology, Williams & Wilkins 1995, * D Resnick: Diagnosis of Bone and Joint Disorders Vol V, Saunders 1995, == External links == Category:Arthropathies Category:Congenital disorders of musculoskeletal system ","title":"Coxa vara"},{"id":"525960","text":"Enteritis is inflammation of the small intestine.

Accessed 24 August 2009. such as serratia, but may have other causes such as NSAIDs, cocaine, radiation therapy as well as autoimmune conditions like Crohn's disease and coeliac disease. Symptoms include abdominal pain, cramping, diarrhea, dehydration, and fever. Related diseases of the gastrointestinal system include inflammation of the stomach and large intestine. { ! Condition !! Organ -  gastritis  stomach . -  gastroenteritis  stomach and small intestine -  colitis  large intestine -  enterocolitis  large and small intestine } Duodenitis, jejunitis and ileitis are subtypes of enteritis which are only localised to a specific part of the small intestine. Inflammation of both the stomach and small intestine is referred to as gastroenteritis. == Signs and symptoms == Signs and symptoms of enteritis are highly variable and vary based on the specific cause and other factors such as individual variance and stage of disease. Symptoms may include abdominal pain, cramping, diarrhoea, dehydration, fever, nausea, vomiting and weight loss. == Causes  Autoimmune === Crohn's disease ‚Äì also known as regional enteritis, it can occur along any surface of the gastrointestinal tract. In 40% of cases it is limited to the small intestine. Coeliac disease ‚Äì caused by an autoimmune reaction to gluten by genetically predisposed individuals. Eosinophilic enteropathy ‚Äì a condition where eosinophils build up in the gastrointestinal tract and blood vessels, leading to polyp formation, necrosis, inflammation and ulcers. It is most commonly seen in patients with a history of atopy, however is overall relatively uncommon. === Infectious enteritis === In Germany, 90% of cases of infectious enteritis are caused by four pathogens, Norovirus, Rotavirus, Campylobacter and Salmonella. Other common causes of infectious enteritis include bacteria such as Shigella and E. coli, as well as viruses such as adenovirus, astrovirus and calicivirus. Other less common pathogens include Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium difficile and Staphylococcus aureus. Campylobacter jejuni is one of the most common sources of infectious enteritis, and the most common bacterial pathogen found in 2 year old and smaller children with diarrhoea. It has been linked to consumption of contaminated water and food, most commonly poultry and milk. The disease tends to be less severe in developing countries, due to the constant exposure which people have with the antigen in the environment, leading to early development of antibodies. Rotavirus is responsible for infecting 140 million people and causing 1 million deaths each year, mostly in children younger than 5 years. This makes it the most common cause of severe childhood diarrhoea and diarrhea-related deaths in the world. It selectively targets mature enterocytes in the small intestine, causing malabsorption, as well as inducing secretion of water. It has also been observed to cause villus ischemia, and increase intestinal motility. The net result of these changes is induced diarrhoea. Enteritis necroticans is an often fatal illness, caused by Œ≤-toxin of Clostridium perfringens. This causes inflammation and segments of necrosis throughout the gastrointestinal tract. It is most common in developing countries, however has also been documented in post-World War II Germany. Risk factors for enteritis necroticans include decreased trypsin activity, which prevent intestinal degradation of the toxin, and reduced intestinal motility, which increases likelihood of toxin accumulation. === Vascular disease === Ischemic enteritis is uncommon compared to ischemic colitis due to the highly vascularised nature of the small intestine, allowing for sufficient blood flow in most situations. It develops due to circulatory shock of mesenteric vessels in the absence of major vessel occlusion, often associated with an underlying condition such as hypertension, arrhythmia or diabetes. Thus it has been considered to be associated with atherosclerosis. Surgical treatment is usually required due to the likelihood of stenosis or complete occlusion of the small intestine. Ischemic damage can range from mucosal infarction, which is limited only to the mucosa; mural infarction of the mucosa and underlying submucosa; to transmural infarction of the full thickness of the gastrointestinal wall. Mucosal and mural infarcts in and of themselves may not be fatal, however may progress further to a transmural infarct. This has the potential for perforation of the wall, leading to peritonitis. === Radiation enteritis === Inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract is common after treatment with radiation therapy to the abdomen or pelvis. It is classified as early if it manifests within the first 3 months, and delayed if it manifests 3 months after treatment. Early radiation enteritis is caused by cell death of the crypt epithelium and subsequent mucosal inflammation, however usually subsides after the course of radiation therapy is completed. Delayed radiation enteritis is a chronic disease which has a complex pathogenesis involving changes in the majority of the intestinal wall. == Diagnosis == Diagnosis may be simple in cases where the patient's signs and symptoms are idiopathic to a specific cause. However this is generally not the case, considering that many pathogens which cause enteritis may exhibit the similar symptoms, especially early in the disease. In particular, campylobacter, shigella, salmonella and many other bacteria induce acute self-limited colitis, an inflammation of the lining of the colon which appears similar under the microscope. A medical history, physical examination and tests such as blood counts, stool cultures, CT scans, MRIs, PCRs, colonoscopies and upper endoscopies may be used in order to perform a differential diagnosis. A biopsy may be required to obtain a sample for histopathology. == Treatment == Mild cases usually do not require treatment and will go away after a few days in healthy people. In cases where symptoms persist or when it is more severe, specific treatments based on the initial cause may be required. In cases where diarrhea is present, replenishing fluids lost is recommended, and in cases with prolonged or severe diarrhoea which persists, intravenous rehydration therapy or antibiotics may be required. A simple oral rehydration therapy (ORS) can be made by dissolving one teaspoon of salt, eight teaspoons of sugar and the juice of an orange into one litre of clean water. Studies have shown the efficacy of antibiotics in reducing the duration of the symptoms of infectious enteritis of bacterial origin, however antibiotic treatments are usually not required due to the self-limiting duration of infectious enteritis. ==Etymology == The word enteritis () uses combining forms of entero- and -itis, both New Latin from Greek, respectively from ·ºëŒΩœÑŒµœÅŒøŒΩ (enteron, small intestine) and -ŒπœÑŒπœÇ (-itis, inflammation). ==See also== *Enteropathy *Staphylococcal enteritis ==References== == External links == Category:Inflammations Category:Intestinal infectious diseases ","title":"Enteritis"},{"id":"525961","text":"Wawona (formerly, Big Tree Station, Clark's Station, Clarks Station, Wah-wo- nah, and Clark's Ranch) is a census-designated place in Mariposa County, California.

His mother was Jane, daughter of Reverend Thomas Wright, Rector of Market Bosworth, Leicestershire. Blakiston explored western Canada with the Palliser Expedition between 1857 and 1859. Mount Blakiston, the highest point in Waterton Lakes National Park was named for him in 1858. In 1861 he traveled up the Yangtze River in China, going further than any Westerner before him. He spent the next part of his life in Japan and became one of the major naturalists in that country. He moved to the United States in 1885. Blakiston died aged 58 of pneumonia in October 1891 while in San Diego, California and is buried in Greenlawn Cemetery, Columbus, Ohio. Blakiston was the first person to notice that animals in Hokkaid≈ç, Japan's northern island, were related to northern Asian species, whereas those on Honsh≈´ to the south were related to those from southern Asia. The Tsugaru Strait between the two islands was therefore established as a zoogeographical boundary, and became known as \\"Blakiston's Line\\". Blakiston collected an owl specimen in Hakodate, Japan in 1883. This was later described by Henry Seebohm and named Blakiston's fish owl. Blakiston married Ann Mary Dun in 1885. She was the daughter of James Dun and the sister of Edwin Dun. They had one daughter and one son. Ann Mary survived him by 46 years and died in England in March 1937. ==References== * * *Ibis Jubilee supplement 1908 Category:1832 births Category:1891 deaths Category:Deaths from pneumonia Category:People from Lymington Category:English explorers of North America Category:Explorers of Canada Category:English zoologists Category:English explorers Category:Burials at Green Lawn Cemetery, Columbus, Ohio ","title":"Thomas Blakiston"},{"id":"525963","text":"Verapamil, sold under various trade names, is a medication used for the treatment of high blood pressure, angina (chest pain from not enough blood flow to the heart), and supraventricular tachycardia. It may also be used for the prevention of migraines and cluster headaches. It is given by mouth or by injection into a vein. Common side effects include headache, low blood pressure, nausea, and constipation. Other side effects include allergic reactions and muscle pains. It is not recommended in people with a slow heart rate or heart failure. It is believed to cause problems for the baby if used during pregnancy. It is in the non‚Äìdihydropyridine calcium channel blocker family of medications. Verapamil was approved for medical use in the United States in 1981. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Verapamil is available as a generic medication. Long acting formulations exist. In 2017, it was the 145th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than four million prescriptions. ==Medical uses== Verapamil (brand name Verelan) 300-mg extended-release capsule Verapamil is used for controlling ventricular rate in supraventricular tachycardia and migraine headache prevention. It is a class-IV antiarrhythmic and more effective than digoxin in controlling ventricular rate. Verapamil is not listed as a first line agent by the guidelines provided by JAMA in JNC-8. However, it may be used to treat hypertension if patient has co-morbid atrial fibrillation or other types of arrhythmia. Verapamil is also used intra- arterially to treat cerebral vasospasm. Verapamil is used to treat the condition cluster headache. Tentative evidence supports the use of verapamil topically to treat plantar fibromatosis. ==Contraindications== Use of verapamil is generally avoided in people with severe left ventricular dysfunction, hypotension (systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg), cardiogenic shock, and hypersensitivity to verapamil. It is also contraindicated in people with atrial flutter or fibrillation and an existing accessory tract such as in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. ==Side effects== The most common side effect of verapamil is constipation (7.3%). Other side effects include dizziness (3.3%), nausea (2.7%), low blood pressure (2.5%), and headache 2.2%. Other side effects seen in less than 2% of the population include: edema, congestive heart failure, pulmonary edema, fatigue, elevated liver enzymes, shortness of breath, low heart rate, atrioventricular block, rash and flushing. Along with other calcium channel blockers, verapamil is known to induce gingival enlargement. ===Overdose=== Acute overdose is often manifested by nausea, weakness, slow heart rate, dizziness, low blood pressure, and abnormal heart rhythms. Plasma, serum, or blood concentrations of verapamil and norverapamil, its major active metabolite, may be measured to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to aid in the medicolegal investigation of fatalities. Blood or plasma verapamil concentrations are usually in a range of 50‚Äì500 Œºg/l in persons on therapy with the drug, but may rise to 1‚Äì4 mg/l in acute overdose patients and are often at levels of 5‚Äì10 mg/l in fatal poisonings. ==Mechanism of action== Verapamil's mechanism in all cases is to block voltage-dependent calcium channels. In cardiac pharmacology, calcium channel blockers are considered class-IV antiarrhythmic agents. Since calcium channels are especially concentrated in the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes, these agents can be used to decrease impulse conduction through the AV node, thus protecting the ventricles from atrial tachyarrhythmias. Verapamil is also a Kv voltage gated potassium channel blocker. Calcium channels are also present in the smooth muscle lining blood vessels. By relaxing the tone of this smooth muscle, calcium channel blockers dilate the blood vessels. This has led to their use in treating high blood pressure and angina pectoris. The pain of angina is caused by a deficit in oxygen supply to the heart. Calcium channel blockers like verapamil dilate blood vessels, which increases the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart. ===Cluster headaches=== Preventive therapy with verapamil is believed to work because it has an effect on the circadian rhythm and on CGRPs. As CGRP-release is controlled by voltage-gated calcium channels. ==Pharmacokinetic details== More than 90% of verapamil is absorbed when given orally, but due to high first-pass metabolism, bioavailability is much lower (10‚Äì35%). It is 90% bound to plasma proteins and has a volume of distribution of 3‚Äì5 l/kg. It takes 1 to 2 hours to reach peak plasma concentration after oral administration. It is metabolized in the liver to at least 12 inactive metabolites (though one metabolite, norverapamil, retains 20% of the vasodilatory activity of the parent drug). As its metabolites, 70% is excreted in the urine and 16% in feces; 3‚Äì4% is excreted unchanged in urine. This is a nonlinear dependence between plasma concentration and dosage. Onset of action is 1‚Äì2 hours after oral dosage. Half-life is 5‚Äì12 hours (with chronic dosages). It is not cleared by hemodialysis. It is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for adverse reaction in nursing infants, nursing should be discontinued while verapamil is administered. Verapamil has been reported to be effective in both short-term and long-term treatment of mania and hypomania. Addition of magnesium oxide to the verapamil treatment protocol enhances the antimanic effect. ==Veterinary use== Intra-abdominal adhesions are common in rabbits following surgery. Verapamil can be given postoperatively in rabbits which have suffered trauma to abdominal organs to prevent formation of these adhesions. Such effect was not documented in another study with ponies. ==Uses in cell biology== Verapamil inhibits the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family of proteins found in stem cells and has been used to study cancer stem cells (CSC) within head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. Verapamil is also used in cell biology as an inhibitor of drug efflux pump proteins such as P-glycoprotein and other ABC transporter proteins. This is useful, as many tumor cell lines overexpress drug efflux pumps, limiting the effectiveness of cytotoxic drugs or fluorescent tags. It is also used in fluorescent cell sorting for DNA content, as it blocks efflux of a variety of DNA-binding fluorophores such as Hoechst 33342. Radioactively labelled verapamil and positron emission tomography can be used with to measure P-glycoprotein function. == See also == * Gallopamil * Tiapamil == References == == External links == * * Category:Antiarrhythmic agents Category:Calcium channel blockers Category:Catechol ethers Category:Glycine receptor antagonists Category:Hepatotoxins Category:Isopropyl compounds Category:Nitriles Category:Pfizer brands Category:Phenethylamines Category:World Health Organization essential medicines Category:Wikipedia medicine articles ready to translate ","title":"Verapamil"},{"id":"525965","text":"Charles-Ir√©n√©e Castel, abb√© de Saint-Pierre (18 February 1658 - 29 April 1743) was a French author whose ideas were novel for his times. His proposal of an international organisation to maintain peace was perhaps the first in history, with the possible exception of George of Podƒõbrady's Tractatus (1462‚Äì1464). He influenced Rousseau and Kant. == Biography == Saint-Pierre was born at the ch√¢teau of Saint-Pierre-√âglise near Cherbourg, where his father, the Marquis de Saint-Pierre, was grand bailli of Cotentin. He was educated by the Jesuits. The youngest of five children and unsuited to a military career owing to poor health, he became a priest. He was introduced by family connections into the salons of Madame de la Fayette and the Marquise de Lambert in Paris. He was elected to the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise in 1695, although he had previously produced no notable work; his election was an episode in the Quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns, Saint-Pierre being a clear representative of the latter. The same year he gained a footing at court as chaplain to Madame, the king's sister-in-law. From 1703 to his death, he was abbot of Tiron. Contrary to a widely believed opinion, it is not while working as a negotiator of the Treaty of Utrecht (1712‚Äì13) that he developed his project of universal peace. Saint- Pierre worked on the idea from 1708 and published early versions from 1712. In 1718, he published Discours sur la polysynodie,\\"Discourse on the plurality of councils\\" where he proposed that appointed ministers be replaced by elected councils. As a consequence of his criticism of the policy of Louis XIV (d. 1715) he was expelled from the Acad√©mie later the same year. In 1724, with Pierre-Joseph Alary he founded the Club de l'Entresol, an independent discussion group on the English model; the club was closed by Louis XV for political reasons in 1731. He died in Paris on 29 April 1743 aged 85. == Ideas == Saint-Pierre's works are centered on an acute and visionary criticism of politics, law and social institutions. He had a great influence on Rousseau, who left elaborate examinations of some of them, and was a forerunner of Kant's 1795 essay on perpetual peace.Daniele Archibugi, Models of International Organization in Perpetual Peace Projects, Review of International Studies, vol. 18, no. 4, 1992, pp. 295-317. He can be seen as an early proponent of the ideas of the Enlightenment. Saint-Pierre was one of the first to mention the possibility of a European union made by independent and autonomous states.Hont, I. (2005) Jealousy of trade: international competition and the nation-state in historical perspective. Cambridge: Harvard University Press. His work on a European community directly inspired the idea of an international order based on the principle of collective self-defense, and was important to the creation of the Concert of Europe, and later the League of Nations,Phillips, Walter A. (1920) The Confederation of Europe (2nd ed.) (p. 34) whose successor is the United Nations Organisation. Friederich the Great of Prussia wrote to Voltair on the 'Projet pour rendre la paix perp√©tuelle en Europe': \\"The Abbe de Saint-Pierre has sent me a fine work on how to re- establish peace in Europe. The thing is very practicable. All it lacks to be successful, is the consent of all Europe and a few other such small details.\\" Ideas contributed by Saint-Pierre include: * an equitable tax system, including a graduated income tax, * free public education, for women as well as men, * state improvement of transportation to further commerce, * an international court and league of states (Projet de paix perp√©tuelle 1713), * a constitutional monarchy, aided by a system of councils and an academy of experts (Discours sur la polysynodie 1718). == Works  Printed books === * Ouvrages de morale et de politique.

Little originally meaning the smaller part, with time, \\"Little Russia\\" developed into a political and geographical concept in Russia, referring to most of the territory of modern- day Ukraine before the 20th century. Accordingly, derivatives such as \\"Little Russian\\" (, ) were commonly applied to the people, language, and culture of the area. Prior to the revolutionary events of 1917, a large part of the region's √©lite population adopted a Little Russian identity that competed with the local Ukrainian identity. After the collapse of the Russian Empire in 1917, and with the amalgamation of Ukrainian territories into one administrative unit (the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic), the term started to recede from common use. Its subsequent usage has been regarded as derogatory by Ukrainians. The term is archaic, and Ukrainians regard its anachronistic usage as offensive. == Etymology == Dialectic partition of the Russian language in 1915 (including Little Russian dialect) The toponym translates as Little or Lesser Rus‚Äô and is adapted from the Greek term, used in medieval times by Patriarchs of Constantinople since the 14th century (it first appeared in church documents in 1335). The Byzantines called the northern and southern parts of Rus‚Äô lands () ‚Äì Greater Rus‚Äô) and ( ‚Äì Lesser or Little Rus‚Äô), respectively. Initially Little or Lesser meant the smaller part, as after the division of the united Rus' Metropolis (ecclesiastical province) into two parts in 1305, a new southwestern metropolis in the Kingdom of Halych-Volynia consisted of only 6 of the 19 former eparchies. –°–æ–ª–æ–≤—å–µ–≤ –ê. –í. –í–µ–ª–∏–∫–∞—è, –ú–∞–ª–∞—è –∏ –ë–µ–ª–∞—è –†—É—Å—å // –í–æ–ø—Ä–æ—Å—ã –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∏. ‚Äì –ú.: –ò–∑–¥-–≤–æ –ê–ù –°–°–°–†, 1947. ‚Äì ‚Ññ 7. ‚Äì –°. 24‚Äì38.

In a 1335 letter to Dietrich von Altenburg, the Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights, he styled himself ¬´dux totius Rusi√¶ Minoris¬ª.

The usage of the name was later broadened to apply loosely to the parts of Right-bank Ukraine when it was annexed by Russia at the end of the 18th century upon the partitions of Poland. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the Russian Imperial administrative units known as the Little Russian Governorate and eponymous General Governorship were formed and existed for several decades before being split and renamed in subsequent administrative reforms. Up to the very end of the 19th century, Little Russia was the prevailing term for much of the modern territory of Ukraine controlled by the Russian Empire, as well as for its people and their language. This can be seen from its usage in numerous scholarly, literary and artistic works. Ukrainophile historians Mykhaylo Maksymovych, Nikolay Kostomarov, Dmytro Bahaliy, and Volodymyr Antonovych acknowledged the fact that during the Russo- Polish wars, Ukraine had only a geographical meaning, referring to the borderlands of both states, but Little Russia was the ethnonym of Little (Southern) Russian people.In his private diary Taras Shevchenko wrote \\"Little Russia\\" or \\"Little Russian\\" twenty one times, and \\"Ukraine\\" 3 times (\\"Ukrainian\\" ‚Äì never) and (\\"Kozak\\" ‚Äì 74).

The term Little Russian language was used by the state authorities in the first Russian Empire Census, conducted in 1897. ==From Little Russia to Ukraine== The term Little Russia, which traces its origin to medieval times, was once widely used as the name for the geographic territory. The first appearance of the name Ukraine (Ukrayina) was in 12th-century chronicles; it was used sporadically from the mid-17th century until it was reintroduced in the 19th century by several writers making a conscious effort to awaken Ukrainian national awareness.Ukrainians in the Encyclopedia of Ukraine But it was not until the 20th century when the modern term Ukraine started to prevail, while Little Russia gradually fell out of use. ==Modern context== The term Little Russia (Rus' Minor) is now anachronistic when used to refer to the country Ukraine and the modern Ukrainian nation, its language, culture, etc. Such usage is typically perceived as conveying an imperialist view that the Ukrainian territory and people (\\"Little Russians\\") belong to \\"one, indivisible Russia.\\"Analysis of the events of the Orange Revolution in Ukraine by Prof. Y. Petrovsky-Shtern Retrieved May 23, 2007 Today, many Ukrainians consider the term disparaging, indicative of imperial Russian (and Soviet) suppression of Ukrainian identity and language. It has continued to be used in Russian nationalist discourse, in which modern Ukrainians are presented as a single people in a united Russian nation.

This has provoked new hostility toward and disapproval of the term by some Ukrainians. ==\\"Little Russianness\\"== The concept of \\"Little Russianness\\" () is defined by some Ukrainian authors as a provincial complex they see in parts of the Ukrainian community due to its lengthy existence within the Russian Empire. They describe it as an \\"indifferent, and sometimes a negative stance towards Ukrainian national-statehood traditions and aspirations, and often as active support of Russian culture and of Russian imperial policies.\\"Ihor Pidkova (editor), Roman Shust (editor), \\"Dovidnyk z istorii Ukrainy\\", 3-Volumes, \\"–ú–∞–ª–æ—Ä–æ—Å—ñ–π—Å—Ç–≤–æ\\" (t. 2), Kiev, 1993‚Äì1999, (t. 1), (t. 2), (t. 3). Mykhailo Drahomanov, who used the terms Little Russia and Little Russian in his historical works, applied the term Little Russianness to Russified Ukrainians, whose national character was formed under \\"alien pressure and influence\\" and who consequently adopted the \\"worse qualities of other nationalities and lost the better ones of their own.\\" Ukrainian conservative ideologue and politician Vyacheslav Lypynsky defined the term as \\"the malaise of statelessness.\\"Ihor Hyrych. \\"Den\\".

The related term Magyarony has been used to describe Magyarized Rusyns in Carpathian Ruthenia who advocated for the union of that region with Hungary. The term \\"Little Russians\\" has also been used to denote stereotypically uneducated, rustic Ukrainians exhibiting little or no self- esteem. The uncouth stage persona of popular Ukrainian singer and performer Andriy Mykhailovych Danylko is an embodiment of this stereotype; his Surzhyk- speaking drag persona Verka Serduchka has also been seen as perpetuating this demeaning image.

This urban space is bounded by the neighbourhoods of Forest Fields to the north, Mapperley Park to the east, Arboretum to the south and Hyson Green to the west. It is best known as the site of the city's famous annual Goose Fair. ==History== The Lodge, by Mansfield Road. Built in 1857 by Henry Moses Wood as the Lodge to the racecourse The name \\"Forest\\" derives comes from medieval times when the land that is now a recreation ground was part of the Sherwood Forest that once extended from the city of Nottingham to the north of Nottinghamshire. The site was the southernmost part of Sherwood Forest and was part of the open area known formerly as \\"The Lings\\" which, largely covered by gorse and scrub, extended into the parishes of Lenton, Radford and Basford. The site of the Forest was one of the original areas to be protected in perpetuity by the 1845 Nottingham Inclosure Act, which set aside some of Sherwood Forest for public recreational use. In commemoration, the Mayor of Nottingham planted the \\"Inclosure Oak\\" which can still be seen at the Mansfield Road entrance to the Forest. Joseph Paxton, a leading gardener and architect of the nineteenth century, was responsible for the criss-cross formation of walkways. For over 300 years the Forest has been home to sport, including horse racing, cricket and football. It was home to Nottingham Racecourse by 1773, and it remained there until it moved to its current location at Colwick, south east of Nottingham, at the end of the 19th century. Nottingham Forest Football Club first played their games on the Forest after their formation in 1865, hence the club's name. Standing at the Mansfield Road entrance is Forest Lodge, built in 1857. This Grade II listed building was originally used as a Police or Keeper's Lodge and a police cell can still be seen at basement level. A red granite monument stands at the Monument Gate on Forest Road East, commemorating the fallen of the Boer War. By comparison with its sporting heritage, the use of the Forest for the city's traditional Goose Fair is relatively recent. The fair has existed since at least 1541, but it only moved to the Forest in 1928, from its previous long term home in the city's Old Market Square. ==Cultural events== Nottingham Goose Fair in 2007 The city's Goose Fair is held on the Forest in October of every year. Other smaller travelling fairs and circuses take place on the recreation ground throughout the year, usually coinciding with local school holidays. ==Sports and recreation== The Forest Recreation Ground boasts floodlit hard surface courts and grass pitches for ball games, and a traditional bowling lawn. There is also an enclosed children's playground. These facilities are maintained by Nottingham City Council. ===Parkrun=== A parkrun is run at the grounds each week.http://www.parkrun.org.uk/forestrec/ ==Flora and fauna== The Forest Recreation Ground supports many important habitats and species. Mature trees include turkey oak, English elm, English oak, sessile oak, rowan, silver birch, common lime and horse chestnut. Additionally, there have been more recent plantings of London plane, beech, various maples and silver lime. Perennials include autumn crocus, spring crocus, bluebell, ramsons, primrose, wild privet, hazel and guelder rose. Certain parts of the Forest play host to relic meadow flora such as meadow foxtail, short-stemmed meadow-grass, Yorkshire fog, red clover, white clover, oxeye daisy, germander speedwell and meadow saxifrage. With such an abundance of habitat, the Forest attracts many birds such as nuthatches, treecreepers, mistle thrushes, tawny owls, song thrushes, great spotted woodpeckers and chaffinches. The caves of the Rock Cemetery are a Geological County Wildlife Site. The thin turf here supports early and silver hairgrass, harebells, bird's-foot trefoil and spiked sedge. Conspicuous insects include holly blue and clouded yellow butterflies, hornets and cockchafer beetles. ==Public transport== The Forest is home to a park-and- ride site, with spaces for more than 950 cars. Nottingham Express Transit's Forest tram stop is adjacent to the car park, and provides frequent services to and from the city centre and other city locations. ==Restoration of the Forest== As with much urban parkland, the Forest has been threatened by development. Proposals for a recreation centre, to be built on the eastern fringes of the Forest, were rejected following public opposition to loss of green space. However, mature trees and greenery at the northwest corner of the ground have been cut down to provide 989 parking spaces for the Park & Ride that serves the \\"Forest\\" stop for Nottingham Express Transit. As at summer 2008, the Forest was the subject of a public consultation to decide on regeneration priorities, to be funded by an expected Heritage Lottery Fund award. For the last four years, Nottingham City Council and Nottingham's Partnership Council have worked on plans to restore the parkland to its former glory and to better serve the needs of today's park users. The project is also backed by the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (CABE) and by local organisations such as Friends of the Forest. The Forest's ¬£5.2 million restoration project was completed during September 2013. The project encompassed: the restoration and refurbishment of the lodge (now office space) and the pavilion (which now houses a new caf√©, public toilets and office space); the reparation and improvement of footpaths; replacement of park benches, improvements to access to sporting facilities; the amelioration of lighting and security; the expansion of planting areas; and the creation of higher-quality activity areas for young people. Additionally, railings were erected, for example the new green-coloured metal fences next to the bus stop near the Forest's Mansfield Road entrance, as well as the custom panelled columns. In design, these railings are very similar to the historic ones nearby. The final phase of the Forest project created a sports zone with new sports pitches and changing rooms, paid for by the Premier League, the Football Association and Sport England. Work started on the sports zone in November 2014 and completed on 28 October 2015 with an opening event and the unveiling of a plaque in memory of local community activist Jim Taylor who was a driving force behind the project. ==Friends of the Forest== ‚ÄòFriends of the Forest‚Äô is a not-for-profit organisation, funded by donations and public subscription. It supports efforts to maintain the Forest as an accessible, open, green space which has historic importance for the City of Nottingham. Friends of the Forest has worked with Nottingham City Council to prioritise refurbishment and replanting, and to organise voluntary activities that benefit the Forest and increase local awareness of green issues. ==References== ==External links== *Forest Recreation Ground - Nottingham City Council *Inside the Rock Cemetery *Nottingham City Council *Map of Forest Recreation Ground *Nottingham Express Transit *Nottingham Partnership Council Category:Nottingham Category:Nottingham Forest F.C.

Tangway simply means \\"peninsula\\". The second is Kawit or \\"hook\\", referring to the hook-shaped landform along the coast of Bacoor Bay, and from which the Chinese Keit and Spanish Cavite are in turn derived. ===Pre-Hispanic era=== The early inhabitants of Cavite City were the Tagalogs ruled by the Kampilan and the bullhorn of a datu, the tribal form of government. According to folklore, the earliest settlers came from Borneo, led by Gat Hinigiw and his wife Dayang Kaliwanag who bore seven children. Archaeological evidences in the coastal areas show prehistoric settlements. ===Spanish colonial period=== Illustration of the Port of Cavite from the Carta Hydrographica y Chorographica de las Yslas Filipinas (1734). The Spanish shipyards and arsenal in Cavite (1899) The Governor's Palace in the Navy Yard at the old Port City of Cavite (1899) On May 16, 1571 the Spanish conquistador Miguel L√≥pez de Legazpi declared the region a royal encomienda, or royal land grant. Spanish colonizers settled in the most populated area of the place (present day Kawit), they called it Cavite. The old Tangway at the tip of the Cavite Peninsula, across Bacoor Bay was referred to as Cavite la Punta meaning \\"Point of Cavite\\" or Cavite Point. Upon discovering that because of its deep waters, Cavite la Punta was a suitable place for the repair and construction of Spanish ships and galleon, the Spanish moved their settlement there and called it Cavite Nuevo (New Cavite) or plainly Cavite, while the first settlement was renamed \\"Cavite Viejo\\" (and in the early 20th century, regained its former name, Kawit). In 1590, the Spaniards fortified Cavite Nuevo with a muralla (high thick curtain walls) on its western, northern and eastern side while the side fronting Baccor Bay remained open. Fort Guadalupe on the easternmost tip was also built at the same time, and the town became the Puerto de Cavite (Port of Cavite) or Cavite Puerto. The Fort of San Felipe Neri and Porta Vaga gate were constructed in 1595 and completed in 1602. Puerta Vaga (corrupted to Porta Vaga) was the port city's barbican western and only principal entrance from San Roque. It was flanked by the western wall protected by two bastions at its north and southern end. The wall and gate were also separated from the mainland by a moat, which also made the town like an island. Cavite was officially founded as a town in 1614 with Tom√°s Salazar as the earliest known gobernadorcillo recorded. At the same time, the town became the capital of the new politico-military province of Cavite, established also in 1614.Census Office of the Philippine Islands (1920). \\"Census of the Philippine Islands 1918, Vol I\\", pg. 132. Bureau of Printing, Manila. Like some other provinces during the Spanish era, the province adapted the name of its capital town [e.g., Bulacan, Bulacan; Tayabas, Tayabas (now Quezon province); Tarlac, Tarlac; Manila, Manila province ; Balayan, Balayan Province (now Batangas); Taal, Taal (now Batangas); and the present Batangas, Batangas]. San Roque was founded as a separate town also in 1614. At 1663, during the Spanish evacuation of Ternate, Indonesia, the 200 families of mixed Mexican-Filipino- Spanish and Papuan-Indonesian-Portuguese descent who had ruled over the Christianized Sultanate of Ternate and included their Sultan who converted, were relocated to Ternate, Cavite plus Ermita, Manila and San Roque, Cavite.Zamboangue√±o Chavacano: Philippine Spanish Creole or Filipinized Spanish Creole? By Tyron Judes D. Casumpang (Page 3) It was placed under the civil administration of Cavite Puerto until it was granted a right to be a separate and an independent municipality in 1720. La Caridad, formerly known as La Estanzuela of San Roque, separated and was founded as town in 1868. The Spanish Governor General Jose de la Gardana granted the petition of the people led by Don Justo Miranda to make barrio La Estanzuela an independent town. City of churches As the town was progressing, it also became a cosmopolitan town that attracted the different religious orders to set up churches, convents and hospitals within the limited confines of the fortified town. The Franciscan Hospital de San Jose (Saint Joseph Hospital) was built for sailors and soldiers in 1591, the San Diego de Alcala convent in 1608, the Porta Vaga (La Ermita), Our Lady of Loreto (Jesuit), San Juan de Dios (St. John of God), Santo Domingo (Dominicans), Santa Monica (Recollects), and San Pedro, the port's parish church. At the most, the fortified town enclosed eight churches, the Jesuit college of San Ildefonso, public buildings and residences, which served the needs of its population of natives, soldiers and workers at the port, transients and passengers on board the galleons.Muog (2008-01-28). \\"el puerto de cavite/ ribera de cavite ‚Ä¢ cavite city\\".

Manila-Acapulco Galleon Trade The skyline of the old Port City of Cavite in 1899 The Port of Cavite (Puerto de Cavite) was linked to the history of world trade. Spanish galleons sailed every July to Acapulco (Mexico) while another ship sailed from Acapulco to Cavite. Galleons and other heavy ocean-going ships were not able to enter the Port of Manila along Pasig River because of a sand bar that limits entrance to the river port only to light ships. For this reason, the Port of Cavite was regarded as the Port of Manila,Brewster, Sir David (1832). \\"The Edinburgh Encyclopaedia, Vol. 15 ‚Äì Philippine Islands\\".

Control over the port was turned over to the Americans by Spain after the Treaty of Paris of 1898 at the turn of the 19th century. At the start of the American era, Cavite Puerto became the seat of the U.S. Naval Forces in the Philippines. It was redesigned to make way for modern ships and armaments. The ruinous historical structures like Fort Guadalupe were demolished, along with most of Fort San Felipe. Local government administration was under the renamed Presidentes municipales with the direct supervision of the American Army Officers (the first being Colonel Meade). The first Filipino Presidentes municipales were appointed: Don Zacaria Fortich for Cavite Puerto, Don Francisco Basa for San Roque, and Don Pedro Raque√±o Bautista for Caridad. In 1900, the Cavite√±os tasted their first election under the American regime. They elected in each pueblo or town, local officials called Presidente municipal, Vice-Presidente municipal and a Consejo (council) composed of Consejales (councilors). They elected Don Gregorio Basa as Presidente Municipal of the town now known as Cavite City. In 1901, the Philippine Commission approved a municipal code as the organic law of all local governments throughout the country. In its implementation in 1903, the three separate pueblos of Cavite Puerto, San Roque and La Caridad were merged into one municipality, which was called the Municipality of Cavite. By virtue of a legislative act promulgated by the First Philippine Assembly, Cavite was again made the capital of the province. Subsequently, its territory was enlarged to include the district of San Antonio and the island of Corregidor. The Municipality of Cavite functioned as a civil government whose officials consisted of a Presidente Municipal, a Vice-Presidente Municipal and ten Consejales duly elected by the qualified voters of the municipality. In 1909, Executive Order No. 124, of Governor-General W. Cameron Forbes, declared the Act No. 1748 annexing Corregidor and the islands of Caballo (Fort Hughes), La Monja, El Fraile (Fort Drum), Santa Amalia, Carabao (Fort Frank) and Limbones, as well as all waters and detached rocks surrounding them, to the Municipality of Cavite. ===Cityhood=== Under the Philippine Commonwealth, Assemblyman Manuel S. Rojas, sponsored Commonwealth Act No. 547 elevating Cavite town to a chartered city. Upon approval into law on September 7, 1940, the executive function of the city was vested in a City Mayor appointed by the President of the Philippine Commonwealth. The legislative body of the City of Cavite was vested on a Municipal Board composed of three electives, two appointive and two ex-officio councilors, the presiding officer of which is the City Mayor. ===World War II=== The belfry ruins of the Santa Monica Church after the city was heavily bombarded in World War II. On December 10, 1941, two days after an attack that had destroyed American air defenses at Clark Field and three days after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Japanese Imperial Forces destroyed Cavite Naval Base and bombed Cavite City. Later, after Japan seized the Philippines, Japanese leaders appointed at least two city mayors of Cavite City. The island of Corregidor played an important role during the Japanese invasion of the Philippines. The island was the site of two costly sieges and pitched battles‚Äîthe first during the first months of 1942, and the second in January 1945‚Äîbetween the Imperial Japanese Army and the U.S. Army, along with its smaller subsidiary force, the Philippine Army. In 1945 during the fight for the liberation of the country from Japanese hands, the US and Philippine Commonwealth military bombarded the Japanese forces stationed in the city, completely destroying the old historic port city of Cavite. The old walls and the Porta Vaga gate were damaged. Most of the structures were destroyed while some of the church towers remained. The city was littered with bomb craters.Tewell, John (2011-01-29). \\"Cavite, Luzon Island, Philippines 1945\\". Flickr. Retrieved on 2014-10-20. After the war, the city's local administration resumed the way it was before the war. The walls, gate and ruins of the old city were later removed. Only the bell tower of the Santa Monica Church of the Recollects and the two bastions of Fort San Felipe remain of the old city. ===Transfer of provincial capital=== Republic Act No. 981, passed by the Congress of the Philippines in 1954, transferred the capital of the province from Cavite City to the newly established Trece Martires City. Subsequently, the city charter was amended. By virtue of an amendment to the charter of Cavite City, the City Mayor, City Vice Mayor and eight councilors were elected by popular suffrage. The first election of city officials was held in 1963. ===Contemporary history=== In 1972, Mayor Manuel S. Rojas was assassinated in the nearby town of Bacoor, Cavite. ===Reclamation=== In the latter part of 1960s or early 1970s, the land adjacent to the San Roque isthmus was reclaimed. The new land is now occupied by the San Sebastian College ‚Äì Recoletos de Cavite and some residential houses. The present Cavite City Hall is built where the north tower end of the western wall was, which was already partly reclaimed by 1945. Half of the old port city, including Fort San Felipe, is now occupied by Naval Base Cavite and is closed to the public. The old historic core of Cavite is now part of the San Roque district of Cavite City and is referred today as either Fort San Felipe or Porta Vaga. The former location of the Porta Vaga gate, the western wall and its towers are now occupied by the Governor Samonte Park. ==Geography== Cavite City and peninsula (lower left) in relation to the City of Manila (upper middle) The City of Cavite occupies most of the hook-shaped Cavite Peninsula that juts into Manila Bay. The peninsula is bounded by Bacoor Bay to the southeast. The peninsula ends at two tips ‚Äì Sangley Point and Cavite Point. Ca√±acao Bay is the body of water formed between Sangley Point and Cavite Point. The latter was the location of the old historic Port of Cavite. Both Bacoor and Ca√±acao Bays are inland bays of the larger Manila Bay. The city's only land border is the Municipality of Noveleta to the south. The city is the northernmost settlement in the Province of Cavite, which lies southwest from Manila with a direct distance of about but about by road. Sangley Point, the former location of the United States Sangley Point Naval Base, is the northernmost part of the city, peninsula and province. The former American military naval base has since been converted into a Philippine military base. The historic island of Corregidor, the adjacent islands and detached rocks of Caballo, Carabao, El Fraile and La Monja found at the mouth of Manila Bay are part of the city's territorial jurisdiction. ===Climate=Subdivisions=== The city proper is divided into five districts: Dalahican, Santa Cruz, Caridad, San Antonio, and San Roque. These districts are further subdivided into eight zones and a total of 84 barangays. ===Barangays=== Cavite City is politically subdivided into 84 barangays. * Barangay 1 (Hen. M. Alvarez) * Barangay 2 (Hen. C. Tirona) * Barangay 3 (Hen. E. Aguinaldo) * Barangay 4 (Hen. M. Trias) * Barangay 5 (Hen. E.

Other Christian religious groups in the city include the Aglipayan Church, Iglesia Ni Cristo (I.N.C), Jehovah's Witnesses, United Church of Christ in the Philippines (UCCP), Jesus Is Lord Church (JIL), The United Methodist Church, Presbyterian Churches, Baptists and Bible Fundamental churches, Seventh-day Adventist Church, Members Church of God International or Ang Dating Daan and other UPC churches. A Muslim minority is also present in the city.  Nuestra Se√±ora de la Soledad de Porta Vaga  The Nuestra Se√±ora de la Soledad de Porta Vaga (Our Lady of Solitude of Porta Vaga) is the patroness of Cavite City. She is revered by Catholics as the Celestial Guardian and Protector of the entire Province of Cavite since her arrival in Cavite shore. The image of Our Lady of Porta Vaga is designated as a National Cultural Treasure by the National Museum. This is the oldest existing dated Marian painting in the Philippines. The Ermita de Porta Vaga or Porta Vaga Church, one of the churches in Cavite Puerto, where Our Lady of Solitude was enshrined with the western wall of Cavite Puerto visible to the left of the building. The image of the virgin is painted on a canvas. The virgin is depicted as a lady in mourning. Mary, garbed in black and white attire, seems to be on her knees as she contemplates the passion of her son. Before her are the crown of thorns and the nails instrument of Christ's passion. An inscription was found at the back of the painting ‚Äì A doze de Abril 1692 a√±os Juan Oliba puso esta Stma. Ymagen Haqui, which means,\\"The sacred image was placed here by Juan Oliba on April 12, 1692\\". This particular icon was used to bless the galleon plying between Cavite and Acapulco (Mexico) during formal sending off ceremonies. Thus, she was also called the Patroness of the Galleons. The image was originally enshrined at the Ermita de Porta Vaga, a small church located adjacent to the Porta Vaga gate of Cavite Puerto and was destroyed during the last world war. The image is presently enshrined at the San Roque Parish Church, one of the three parishes in the City. ===Languages=== Chabacano is a Spanish-influenced creole language formerly spoken by majority of the people living in the city of Cavite. Chabacano emerged sometime after the arrival of the first Spaniards and Mexicans in the late 16th century. During this period, the people that lived near the military arsenal in Cavite City put themselves in contact with the Spaniards and Mexicans and began to incorporate in their own dialect many Spanish words, which then gave birth to the creole. Majority of residents today speak Tagalog. Today, Chabacano is generally considered to be dying with only a fraction of the people, mostly elderly, able to speak the language. According to the Philippine professor, Alfredo B. German who wrote a thesis on the grammar in Chabacano dialect, the present conditions no longer favor the disenrolment of the same one. There are many probable reasons for the diminishing of Chabacano, among these being the massive arrival of Tagalog- speaking migrants to the city of Cavite, and intermarriage. One of the poets and Philippine writers, Jesus Balmori expressed himself in Chabacano. He was a great admirer of the dialect and wrote several verses in it. Another admirer of this dialect was Don Jaime de Veyra, the illustrious writer and famous Philippine historian, who feared more than all the probable extinction of the Chabacano when he wrote the following prophetic lines, \\"I am afraid that the inevitable absorption of the \\"Tagalog invasion\\" on one side and the invasion of the English on the other hand, will wipe out or extinguish this inherited Castilian language in existence with his last representatives in the following generation.\\" Professor Gervacio Miranda who also wrote a book in Chabacano said in his preface the following thing, \\"My only objective to write this book is to possibly conserve in written form the Chabacano of Cavite for posterity,\\" fearing the extinction of the dialect. == Culture  Festivals and events === The city is home to the Annual Cavite City Water Festival or Regada, held every 17th and 24th day of June. It is a festive and religious celebration of the feast of St. John the Baptist. Regada started in 1996 and features the \\"Paulan\\" or \\"Basayawan\\", which is a street party where celebrators dance under water sprinklers. Another celebration is the Feast for the Our Lady of Solitude of Porta Vaga, which is annually observed by local Catholics during every second Sunday of November. Other notable holidays include the observance of Juli√°n Felipe's birthday (January 28). Felipe, who composed the Philippine National Anthem, was born and raised in Cavite City. The city's Charter Day, known locally as simply Cavite City Day, which commemorates the signing of the city charter in 1940, is held every September 7. === Cuisine === Food in Cavite City is influenced by its Spanish heritage combined with Filipino tradition. One popular native dish is bacalao (sauteed codfish), which is served during the Lenten season. A variation of bibingka locally known as bibingkang samala can also be found in the city. This delicacy is made of glutinous rice (malagkit), coconut milk and sugar. == Infrastructure  Transportation === The only road connecting Cavite City to the rest of Luzon is the National Route 62, which begins at P. Burgos Avenue in Caridad district and continues towards Noveleta as the Manila‚ÄìCavite Road (not to be confused with Manila-Cavite Expressway). A proposal to construct an expressway from Kawit to Cavite City via Bacoor Bay has been raised to the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH). When realized, the expressway would serve as a link to Manila-Cavite Expressway (CAVITEx). Cavite City has one airport, Danilo Atienza Air Base, located at Sangley Point. The airport is operated by the Philippine Air Force. It was formerly a US Naval Base, called Naval Station Sangley Point, until it was turned over to the Philippine government in 1971. There are proposals to convert the base into a civilian airport, as a solution to the overcrowding of Ninoy Aquino International Airport. As of 2019, no active water-based public transportation services were based in Cavite City. Metrostar Ferry, which began operations in 2007, used to serve trips from San Roque district to Pasay City, Metro Manila. A new service from the Intramuros district of Manila to the nearby town of Noveleta to the south debuted in January 2018 and is currently the nearest water-based transport to the city. === Utilities === Water services are currently provided by Maynilad. Meanwhile, electric services are provided by Meralco. ==SymbolsSeal=== The seal of Cavite City The current seal of the city was designed by Mayor Timoteo O. Encarnacion, Jr. It was adopted by the Sangguniang Panlungsod through Resolution No. 140-90, then approved by the Local Executive on September 7, 1990. On November 3, 1993, the National Historical Institute and the president, through the Department of Interior and Local Government issued a Certificate of Registration recognizing the new seal. The shield stands for bravery and fortitude. The colors red, white, blue, yellow stand for the loyalty of the people to its government. The inclusion of the rays portrays the role of Cavite as one of the original provinces that rose up in arms against Spanish domination in 1896 in the Philippine Revolution. The white triangle inscribed within the shield with the letters KKK at the corners represents the part played by The city in the organization of the Katipunan. Don Ladislao Diwa of the city was one of the triumvirate who organized the patriotic group. Many Katipuneros came from the city. Within the white triangle are symbols representing various events: * At the bottom of the triangle is a fort with figures \\"1872\\" symbolizing the Cavite mutiny of 1872 at the Cavite Arsenal. * At the background is a map of the city including the island of Corregidor representing the role of the island in the city's history. * The obelisk at the left memorializes the Thirteen Martyrs of Cavite who were executed by the Spaniards on September 12, 1896. * The sheet music at the right symbolizes Juli√°n Felipe, composer of the Philippine National Anthem who was from the city, . * The fort symbol representing the Royal Fort of San Felipe and its role in the city and country's history being the place where the Thirteen Martyrs of Cavite were detained and where the Cavite mutiny of 1872 took place. * The scroll on the uppermost portion of the triangle contains the City motto \\"Para Dios y Patria\\" (\\"For God and Country\\") in Chabacano dialect to emphasize the native dialect of the city. * The green laurel leaf encircling the right and left portions of the KKK triangle symbolizes victories by reason. ===Flag=== City flag of Cavite The flag of the city created by Mayor Timoteo O. Encarnacion, Jr. and was adopted by the Sangguniang Panlungsod through Resolution No. 95-081 dated September 6, 1995 in time for the 55th Cavite City Charter Day. The meaning, symbol and significance of the flag components: * The two red strips symbolize courage and bravery. * The middle green strip symbolizes progress and advancement * The half sun has a twofold meaning. If the rising sun, it means the hope, dreams and visions for progress. If the setting sun, it stands for the sunset that can be seen in the city's western shores. * The five yellow stars symbolize the five districts of Cavite City. * The three sets of waves below the half sun, in three colors of navy blue, light blue and white. It signifies that Cavite City is a peninsula surrounded by water while the three colors represent Ca√±acao Bay, Bacoor Bay and Manila Bay. ==Education== ==Notable people== *Juli√°n Felipe *Ladislao Diwa *Roman Basa *Joel Lamangan *Ferdinand Topacio *Kesz V√°ldez *Efren Pe√±aflorida *Leopoldo Salcedo *Nash Aguas *Celeste Legaspi *Ronnie Del Carmen *Dominic Roque *Eros Atalia *DJ eL Reynolds *Mercedes Matias-Santiago ==Sister city== Cavite City has one sister city, as designated by Sister Cities International: * San Diego, California, United States ==References== ==External links== * Cavite Profile at PhilAtlas.com * Official Cavite City Government website * Official Website of the Cavite City Library and Museum * [ Philippine Standard Geographic Code] * Philippine Census Information Category:Cities in Cavite Category:Populated places on Manila Bay Category:Port cities and towns in the Philippines Category:Former provincial capitals of the Philippines Category:1614 establishments in the Philippines Category:Populated places established in 1614 ","title":"Cavite City"},{"id":"526003","text":"The Free, Independent, and Strictly Neutral City of Cracow with its Territory (), more commonly known as either the Free City of Cracow or Republic of Cracow (, ), was a city republic created by the Congress of Vienna in 1815, which included the city of Krak√≥w and its surrounding areas. It was jointly controlled by its three neighbours (Russia, Prussia, and Austria), and was a centre of agitation for an independent Poland. In 1846, in the aftermath of the unsuccessful Krak√≥w Uprising, the Free City of Cracow was annexed by the Austrian Empire. It was a remnant of the Duchy of Warsaw, which was partitioned between the three states in 1815. The Free City of Cracow was an overwhelmingly Polish-speaking city-state; of its population 85% were Catholics, 14% were Jews while other religions comprised less than 1%. The city of Krak√≥w itself had a Jewish population reaching nearly 40%, while the rest were almost exclusively Polish-speaking Catholics.Censuses of the Austro- Hungarian Statistical Central Commission, cited in Anson Rabinbach, The Migration of Galician Jews to Vienna. Austrian History Yearbook, Volume XI, Berghahn Books/Rice University Press, Houston 1975, p. 46/47 (table III) ==History== The Free City was approved and guaranteed by Article VII of the Treaty between Austria, Prussia, and Russia of 3 May 1815. The statelet received an initial constitution at the same time, revised and expanded in 1818, establishing significant autonomy for the city. The Jagiellonian University could accept students from the partitioned territory of Poland. The Free City thus became a centre of Polish political activity on the territories of partitioned Poland. During the November Uprising of 1830‚Äì31, Krak√≥w was a base for the smuggling of arms into the Russian-controlled Kingdom of Poland. After the end of the uprising the autonomy of the Free City was severely restricted. The police were controlled by Austria and the election of the president had to be approved by all three powers. Krak√≥w was subsequently occupied by the Austrian army from 1836 to 1841. After the unsuccessful Krak√≥w uprising of 1846, the Free City was annexed by Austria on 16 November 1846 as the Grand Duchy of Cracow.

File:Rabacja galicyjska.JPGGalician slaughter (Polish \\"Rze≈∫ galicyjska\\") by Jan Lewicki (1795-1871). ==Geography, population, and economy== The Free City of Cracow was created from the southwest part of the Duchy of Warsaw (part of the former Krak√≥w Department on the left bank of the Vistula river). The territory of the city was at its least 1164‚Äì1234 km¬≤ (sources vary). It bordered the Russian Empire, the Kingdom of Prussia and the Austrian Empire. It comprised the city of Krak√≥w and its environs; the other settlements in the area administered by the Free City included 224 villages and three towns (Chrzan√≥w, Trzebinia and Nowa G√≥ra). In 1815, its population was 95,000; as of 1843, it had a population of 146,000. 85% of them were Catholics, 14% Jews, while other religions comprised 1%. The most notable szlachta family was the Potocki family of magnates, who had a mansion in Krzeszowice. The Free City was a duty-free area, allowed to trade with Russia, Prussia and Austria. In addition to no duties, it had very low taxes, and various economic privileges were granted by the neighbouring powers. As such, it became one of the European centres of economic liberalism and supporters of laissez-faire, attracting new enterprises and immigrants, which resulted in impressive growth of the city. Weavers from Prussian Silesia had often used the Free City as a contraband outlet to avoid tariff barriers along the borders of Austria and the Kingdom of Poland, but with Austria's annexation of the Free City came a significant drop in Prussian textile exports.

The statelet received an initial constitution in 1815 which had mainly been devised by Prince Adam Jerzy Czartoryski. The constitution was revised and expanded in 1818, establishing significant autonomy for the city. Legislative power was vested in the Assembly of Representatives (Izba Reprezentant√≥w), and the executive power was given to a Governing Senate. In 1833, in the aftermath of the November Uprising and the foiled plan by some Polish activists to start an uprising in Krak√≥w, the partitioning powers issued a new, much more restrictive constitution: the number of senators and deputies was lowered and their competences limited, while the commissars of the partitioning powers had their competences expanded. Freedom of the press was also curtailed. In 1835 a secret treaty between the three partitioning powers presented a plan in which in case of additional Polish unrest, Austria was given the right to occupy and annex the city. That would take place after the Krak√≥w Uprising of 1846. The law was based on the Napoleonic civil code and French commercial and criminal law. The official language was Polish. In 1836 the local police force was disbanded and replaced by Austrian police; in 1837 the partitioning powers curtailed the competences of the local courts which refused to bow down to their demands. The Free City of Krak√≥w was the first purely republican government in the history of Poland. ==See also== * History of Poland (1795‚Äì1918) * Former countries in Europe after 1815 * Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria * Grand Duchy of Krakow * Galician slaughter == Notes == ==References== ==References== * * * ==Further reading== * Category:1815 establishments in Europe Category:1846 disestablishments in Europe Category:States and territories established in 1815 Free City of Krakow Free City of Krakow Category:Former Slavic countries Category:Free City of Krak√≥w Category:Condominia (international law) ","title":"Free City of Cracow"},{"id":"526004","text":"An emirp (prime spelled backwards) is a prime number that results in a different prime when its decimal digits are reversed.

The family had moved to England from Bad Pyrmont in Germany. Henry's mother Estther Wheeler (1798‚Äì1864) was a granddaughter of William Tuke. The Seebohms were active in the Society of Friends and Henry schooled within the community in York. He worked initially in a grocery as an assistant but moved to Sheffield where he became a steel manufacturer. He married Maria, daughter of George John Healey, a merchant in Manchester on 19 January 1859. == Natural history == Henry became interested in natural history at school and continued to spend his spare time studying birds on his journeys. He travelled widely visiting Greece, Scandinavia, Turkey, and South Africa. His expeditions to the Yenisey tundra of Siberia were described in his two books, Siberia in Europe (1880) and Siberia in Asia (1882), which were combined in the posthumous publication The Birds of Siberia (1901). His expeditions included the lower Pechora River in 1875 along with John Alexander Harvie-Brown as well as a visit to Heligoland at the home of Heinrich G√§tke. In 1877 he joined Joseph Wiggins to Siberia. He was one of the first European ornithologists to accept the American trinomial system to classify sub-species. Seebohm's other publications included A History of British Birds (1883), The Geographical Distribution of the family Charadriidae (1887), The Birds of the Japanese Empire (1890) and A Monograph of the Turdidae (1902, completed by Richard Bowdler Sharpe). Seebohm bequeathed his collection of bird-skins to the British Museum. The collection which was received in 1896 consisted of nearly 17,000 specimens. A number of birds were named after Seebohm, including the grey emutail (Dromaeocercus seebohmi) by Bowdler Sharpe. A portrait of Seebohm in oil by Hugh Ford Crighton is held by Sheffield Museums. == Bibliography == * (1901) The birds of Siberia; a record of a naturalist's visits to the valleys of the Petchora and Yenesei.

De Cl√©ron represented Seine-et-Marne in the National Assembly (1871) and voted with the Right Centre. Though he was not elected to the chamber of deputies he became the righthand man of his maternal uncle Albert, 4th duc de Broglie, in the attempted coup of May 16. His Les √©tablissements p√©nitentiaires en France et aux colonies (1875) was crowned by the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise, of which he was admitted a member on January 26, 1888. In 1891 the resignation of Henri Edouard Bocher from the administration of the Orleans estates led to the appointment of d'Haussonville as accredited representative of the comte de Paris in France. He at once set to work to strengthen the Orleanist party by recruiting from the smaller nobility the officials of the local monarchical committees. He established new Orleanist organs, and sent out lecturers with instructions to emphasize the modern and democratic principles of the comte de Paris; hut the prospects of the party were dashed in 1894 by the death of the comte de Paris. In 1904 he was admitted to the Acad√©mie des sciences morales et politiques. ==Family== In 1865 d'Haussonville married Mlle Pauline d'Harcourt. ==Works== The comte d'Haussonville published: * Sainte-Beuve, sa vie et ses ≈ìuvres (1875) * √âtudes biographiques et litt√©raires, 2 vol.

In the later films, made in collaboration with Paul Morrissey, Warhol brought in new superstars including Joe Dallesandro, Penny Arcade, Andrea Feldman, Jane Forth, Geraldine Smith, Luke Wienecke and Sylvia Miles. During this period Warhol developed an increasing fascination with trans women and drag queens, and promoted Candy Darling, Holly Woodlawn and Jackie Curtis to superstar status.

Alibori is a fertile region consisting of highland and savannah. Cotton, maize and cassava are the major crops grown. The northeast plains slope down to the valley of the Niger River which, along with the M√©krou River, forms the border with Niger. Other major rivers include the Alibori River, Sota River and Pako River. The department contains the bulk of Benin's section of the trans-boundary W National Park.parc-w.net : Official site. The climate is mostly humid and tropical. The northern regions of Benin, in general, receives one season of rainfall from May to September, compared to the southern regions which receive two spells from March to July and September to November. Harmattan winds blow from the northeast from December through March. The average temperature from April to June is in Karimama, while the temperature ranges between between November and March. The average elevation of the department is above the mean sea level. ===Settlements=== Kandi is the departmental capital; other major settlements include Banikoara, Gounarou, Gu√©n√®, Malanville and S√©gbana. ==Demographics== According to Benin's 2013 census, the total population of the department was 867,463, with 431,357 males and 436,106 females. The proportion of women was 50.30%. The total rural population was 75.70%, while the urban population was 24.30%. The proportion of women of childbearing age (15 to 49 years old) was 22.00%. The foreign population was 28,636, representing 3.30% of the total population in the department. The labour force participation rate among foreigners aged 15‚Äì64 years was 26.40%. The proportion of women among the foreign population constituted 47.60%. The number of households in the department was 108,351 and the average household size was 8.

The main ethnolinguistic groups in the department are the Bariba, Boko, Dendi, Fulani, Gurma, Kyenga and the Mokole Yoruba. ==Administrative divisions== Communes of Alibori The department of Alibori was created in 1999, when it was split off from Borgou Department. Since 2008, the department's capital has been Kandi. Alibori is subdivided into six communes, each centered at one of the principal towns: Banikoara, Gogounou, Kandi, Karimama, Malanville and S√©gbana. Benin originally had six administrative regions (d√©partements), which have now been bifurcated to make 12. Each of the deconcentrated administrative services (directions d√©partementales) of the sectoral ministries takes care of two administrative regions. A law passed in 1999 transformed the sous-prefectures, the lowest level of territorial administration, into local governments. Municipalities and communal councils have elected representatives who manage the administration of the regions. The latest elections of the municipal and communal councils were held in June 2015. ==References== ==External links== Category:Departments of Benin Category:States and territories established in 1999 ","title":"Alibori Department"},{"id":"526019","text":"In finance and economics, the nominal interest rate or nominal rate of interest is either of two distinct things: # the rate of interest before adjustment for inflation (in contrast with the real interest rate); or, # for interest rates \\"as stated\\" without adjustment for the full effect of compounding (also referred to as the nominal annual rate). An interest rate is called nominal if the frequency of compounding (e.g. a month) is not identical to the basic time unit in which the nominal rate is quoted (normally a year). ==Nominal versus real interest rate== The concept of real interest rate is useful to account for the impact of inflation. In the case of a loan, it is this real interest that the lender effectively receives. For example, if the lender is receiving 8 percent from a loan and the inflation rate is also 8 percent, then the (effective) real rate of interest is zero: despite the increased nominal amount of currency received, the lender would have no monetary value benefit from such a loan because each unit of currency would get devaluated due to inflation by the same factor as the nominal amount gets increased. The relationship between the real interest value r, the nominal interest rate value R, and the inflation rate value i is given byRichard A. Brealey and Steward C. Meyer. Principles of Corporate Finance, Sixth Edition. Irwin McGraw-Hill, London, 2000. p. 49. :(1+r)=(1+R)/(1+i) \\\\, * When the inflation rate i is low, the real interest rate is approximately given by the nominal interest rate minus the inflation rate, i.e., : r \\\\approx R - i \\\\, In this analysis, the nominal rate is the stated rate, and the real interest rate is the interest after the expected losses due to inflation. Since the future inflation rate can only be estimated, the ex ante and ex post (before and after the fact) real interest rates may be different; the premium paid to actual inflation (higher or lower). ==Nominal versus effective interest rate== The nominal interest rate, also known as an Annualised Percentage Rate or APR, is the periodic interest rate multiplied by the number of periods per year. For example, a nominal annual interest rate of 12% based on monthly compounding means a 1% interest rate per month (compounded). Charles Moyer, James R. McGuigan, William J. Kretlow. Contemporary Financial Management, Tenth Edition. Thomson-South-Western, Mason, Ohio, 2006 pg. 163. A nominal interest rate for compounding periods less than a year is always lower than the equivalent rate with annual compounding (this immediately follows from elementary algebraic manipulations of the formula for compound interest). Note that a nominal rate without the compounding frequency is not fully defined: for any interest rate, the effective interest rate cannot be specified without knowing the compounding frequency and the rate. Although some conventions are used where the compounding frequency is understood, consumers in particular may fail to understand the importance of knowing the effective rate. Nominal interest rates are not comparable unless their compounding periods are the same; effective interest rates correct for this by \\"converting\\" nominal rates into annual compound interest. In many cases, depending on local regulations, interest rates as quoted by lenders and in advertisements are based on nominal, not effective interest rates, and hence may understate the interest rate compared to the equivalent effective annual rate. Confusingly, in the context of inflation, 'nominal' has a different meaning. A nominal rate can mean a rate before adjusting for inflation, and a real rate is a constant- prices rate. The Fisher equation is used to convert between real and nominal rates. To avoid confusion about the term nominal which has these different meanings, some finance textbooks use the term 'Annualised Percentage Rate' or APR rather than 'nominal rate' when they are discussing the difference between effective rates and APR's. The term should not be confused with simple interest (as opposed to compound interest) which is not compounded. The effective interest rate is always calculated as if compounded annually. The effective rate is calculated in the following way, where r is the effective rate, i the nominal rate (as a decimal, e.g. 12% = 0.12), and n the number of compounding periods per year (for example, 12 for monthly compounding): : r \\\\ = \\\\ (1+i/n)^n - 1 ==ExamplesMonthly compounding=== Example 1: A nominal interest rate of 6% compounded monthly is equivalent to an effective interest rate of 6.17%. Example 2: 6% annually is credited as 6%/12 = 0.5% every month. After one year, the initial capital is increased by the factor (1+0.005)12 ‚âà 1.0617. ===Daily compounding=== A loan with daily comp have a substantially higher rate in effective annual terms. For a loan with a 10% nominal annual rate and daily compounding, the effective annual rate is 10.516%. For a loan of $10,000 (paid at the end of the year in a single lump sum), the borrower would pay $51.56 more than one who was charged 10% interest, compounded annually. == References == ==External links== * Convert an Effective Interest Rate to an Annual Percentage Rate * Convert an Annual Percentage Rate to an Effective Interest Rate * Online Nominal Annual Interest Rate Calculator * Online Interest Calculator Category:Interest rates ","title":"Nominal interest rate"},{"id":"526024","text":"Riksgr√§nsen, The National Border in Swedish, is a ski-resort in Kiruna Municipality, Lappland, Sweden, 200 km north of the Arctic Circle.

It is in the London Borough of Sutton, north-east of the town of Sutton itself. Designed to create zero carbon emissions, it was the first large scale community to do so. ==Background== BedZED was designed by the architect Bill Dunster to be carbon neutral, protecting the environment and supporting a more sustainable lifestyle. The project was led by the Peabody Trust in partnership with Bill Dunster Architects, Ellis & Moore Consulting Engineers, BioRegional, Arup and the cost consultants Gardiner and Theobald. The project was also pioneering by being the first construction project where a local authority sold land at below market value to make sustainable development economically viable. The 82 homes and of work space was built within the period of 2000‚Äì2002. The project was shortlisted for the Stirling Prize in 2003. ==Transport== As part of BedZED's eco friendly low-energy-emission concept, cars are discouraged; the project encourages public transport, cycling and walking, and has limited parking space. There are good rail and bus links in the immediate area. They also have a car-share scheme. ==Principles== BedZED buildings BedZED fa√ßade at dusk Side of one of the buildings at BedZED Wind cowls * Zero energy‚ÄîThe project is designed to use only energy from renewable sources generated on site. There are of solar panels. Tree waste was to fuel the development's cogeneration plant (a downdraft gasifier) to provide district heating and electricity. The gasifier was abandoned because of technical implementation problems. * High quality ‚Äì The apartments are finished to a high standard to attract the urban professional. * Energy efficient ‚Äì The houses face south to take advantage of solar gain, are triple glazed, and have high thermal insulation. * Water efficient ‚Äì Most rain water falling on the site is collected and reused. Appliances are chosen to be water-efficient and use recycled water when possible. A \\"living machine\\" system of recycling waste water was installed but did not achieve the required water quality standards. * Low-impact materials ‚Äì Building materials were selected from renewable or recycled sources within of the site, to minimize the energy required for transportation. * Waste recycling ‚Äì Refuse-collection facilities are designed to support recycling. * Transport ‚Äì The development works in partnership with the United Kingdom's leading car-sharing operator, City Car Club. Residents are encouraged to use this environmentally friendly alternative to car ownership; an on-site selection of vehicles are available for use. * Encourage eco-friendly transport ‚Äì Electric and liquefied- petroleum-gas cars have priority over cars that burn petrol and diesel, and electricity is provided in parking spaces for charging electric cars. * A higher reported quality of life, with a strong sense of community. ==Performance== Monitoring conducted in 2003 found that BedZED had achieved these reductions in comparison to UK averages: * Space-heating requirements were 88% less. * Hot-water consumption was 57% less. * The electrical power used, at 3 kilowatt hours per person per day, was 25% less than the UK average; 11% of this was produced by solar panels. The remainder normally would be produced by a combined-heat-and-power plant fuelled by wood chips, but the installation company's financial problems have delayed use of the plant. * Mains-water consumption has been reduced by 50%, or 67% compared to a power-shower household. * The residents' car mileage is 65% less. ==Problems== A review of the BedZed development in 2010 drew mainly positive conclusions. Residents and neighbours were largely happy. However, a few significant failures were highlighted, for example: *The biomass wood chip boiler (biomass gasifier) was no longer in operation and the backup power source, a gas boiler, was used from 2005 - 2017. The downdraft wood chip gasifier CHP (combined heat and power) had reliability problems due to technical problems and the intermittent schedule of operation (no late-night operation) imposed by the local authority. However, BedZED switched from gas back to a biomass pellet boiler in 2017 which provides heat for the district heating network but not electricity, which is now sourced from the grid on a green tariff. The biomass pellets are now sourced from Spain, not from local wood waste. *The 'Living Machine' water recycling facility had been unable to clean the water sufficiently. The cost of the facility also made it unviable. *Passive heating from the sunspaces had been insufficient. *Because of its location, the development requires the constant use of cars by residents. This negates its fundamental raison d'√™tre, other than as an interesting experiment. The results show that the average ecological footprint of a BedZED resident is 4.67 global hectares (2.6 planets), which is 89% of the baseline. This would reduce to 4.32 global hectares (2.4 planets) if the energy was all zero carbon. However, a keen resident at BedZED (if the CHP was working) could achieve an ecological footprint of 3.0 global hectares (1.7 planets) which is 57% of the average. The target was 1 planet. ==Awards== * 2001 ‚Äì Housing Design Award for sustainability, from the Royal Institute of British Architects * 2001 ‚Äì Evening Standard New Homes Awards ‚Äì BedZED won the London Lifestyle award. \\"Ambitious and brave, and a model for future developments\\" * 2001 ‚Äì UK Solar Awards, run by Energy 21, for BedZED ‚Äì \\"perhaps the most influential of all housing projects this century\\". * 2002 ‚Äì World Habitat Awards ‚Äì BedZED was a finalist. * 2003 ‚Äì Office of the Deputy Prime Minister Award for sustainable communities ‚Äì BedZED was short listed with 3 other projects. * 2003 ‚Äì Stirling Prize ‚Äì BedZED was short listed * 2003 ‚Äì RIBA journal sustainability award ‚Äì the judges said \\"BedZED goes way beyond the standard environmental checklist by challenging both the way we live and work...

The culture was highly stratified, as jade, silk, ivory and lacquer artifacts were found exclusively in elite burials, while pottery was more commonly found in the burial plots of poorer individuals. This division of class indicates that the Liangzhu period was an early state, symbolized by the clear distinction drawn between social classes in funeral structures. A pan-regional urban center had emerged at the Liangzhu city-site and elite groups from this site presided over the local centers. The Liangzhu culture was extremely influential and its sphere of influence reached as far north as Shanxi and as far south as Guangdong. Liangzhu site was perhaps among the oldest Neolithic sites in East Asia that would be considered a state society. The type site at Liangzhu was discovered in Yuhang County, Zhejiang and initially excavated by Shi Xingeng in 1936. A 2007 analysis of the DNA recovered from human remains shows high frequencies of Haplogroup O1 in Liangzhu culture linking this culture to modern Austronesian and Tai-Kadai populations. It is believed that the Liangzhu culture or other associated subtraditions are the ancestral homeland of Austronesian speakers. On 6 July 2019, Liangzhu was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. ==Disappearance== The Liangzhu Culture entered its prime about 4000‚Äì5000 years ago, but suddenly disappeared from the Taihu Lake area about 4200 years ago when it reached the peak. There are almost no traces in the following years in this area. Recent research has shown that the development of human settlements was interrupted several times by rising waters. This led researchers to conclude the demise of the Liangzhu culture was brought about by extreme environmental changes such as floods, as the cultural layers are usually interrupted by muddy or marshy and sandy‚Äìgravelly layers with buried paleo trees. Some evidence suggests that the Taihu lake was formed as an impact crater only 4500 years ago, which could help explain the disappearance of the Liangzhu culture. However, other work does not find an impact crater structure or shocked minerals at Taihu Lake. ==City-building and agriculture== The culture possessed advanced agriculture, including irrigation, paddy rice cultivation and aquaculture. Houses were often constructed on stilts, on rivers or shorelines. A new discovery of ancient city wall base relics was announced by the Zhejiang provincial government on November 29, 2007. It was concluded that the site was the center of the Liangzhu culture. A new Liangzhu Culture Museum was completed in 2008 and opened late in the year. The Liangzhu Ancient City is located in a wetland environment on the plain of river networks between Daxiong Mountain and Dazhe Mountain of the Tianmu Mountain Range. This ancient city is said to be the largest city during this time period. Its interior area is 290 hectares, surrounded by clay walls which had six city gates. Two gates were located in the north, east and south walls. At its center was a palace site that spanned 30 hectares and there was also evidence of an artificial flood protection design implemented within the city. Both of these constructions are said to be indicators of the social complexity developing in Liangzhu at the time. A granary may have been in place containing up to 15,000 kg of rice grain. There are numerous waterway entrances both inside and outside of the city, linking it to the river networks. Inside the city were artificial earth mounds and natural hills. Outside of the walled area, remains are found for 700 hectares, the residences are said to be built in an urban planning system. 8 kilometers to the north various dam-like sites were found and are speculated to be an ancient flood protection system. Also discovered inside and outside the city are a large number of utensils for production, living, military and ritual purposes represented by numerous delicate Liangzhu jade wares of cultural profoundness; the remains including city walls, foundations of large structures, tombs, altars, residences, docks and workshops. The Liangzhu city-site is said to have been settled and developed with a specific purpose in mind since this area has very few remains that can be traced back to earlier periods. A typical Liangzhu community, of which there are over 300 found so far, chose to live near rivers. There have been boats and oars recovered which indicate proficiency with boats and watercraft. A Liangzhu site has provided the remains of a wooden pier and an embankment thought to have been used for protection against floods. Houses were raised on wood also to help against flooding, although houses on higher ground included semi-subterranean houses with thatched roofs. Well technology at the Miaoqian site during this period was similar to that of the earlier Hemudu period. The Liangzhu culture is said to have been more socially developed and complex than northern contemporaries in the Han Valley. ==Artifacts and technology== Neolithic pottery dou, Liangzhu Culture, Zhejiang, 1955. National Museum of China, Beijing The inhabitants of Liangzhu sites used artifact designs of \\"bent knee\\" shaped adze handles, stone untangled adzes, art styles emphasizing the use of spirals and circles, cord-marking of pottery, pottery pedestals with cut-out decorations, baked clay spindle whorls, slate reaping knives and spear points. Pottery was often decorated with a red slip. These artifacts are also common in later neolithic Southeast Asia and the technological and economic toolkits of these societies possibly developed in the neolithic Yangtze River area. Some of the Liangzhu pottery is reminiscent of the Shandong Longshan black \\"eggshell\\" style, however most differed and were a soft-fired gray with a black or red slip. There has also been evidence of tremolite particles being used as an ingredient for crafting some of the black \\"eggshell\\" pottery. It was determined that the black color of the pottery resulted from similar advancements in carburization and firing processes. Similarities between Liangchengzhen, the largest Dawenkou site, pottery making process and that of the Liangzhu were noted, which led researchers to believe there was communication between the two cultures. The Guangfulin site showed influence from more northern cultures but also had pottery practices very similar to that of the typical Liangzhu sites. Researchers have found that some of the axes at Liangzhu sites were crafted using diamond tools. The inhabitants of Liangzhu, using these tools, worked corundum into ceremonial axes. The axes were said to \\"have been polished to a mirrorlike luster\\". The techniques they used generated results that are said to be difficult to replicate even with modern technology.This is the earliest known use of diamond tools worldwide, thousands of years earlier than the gem is known to have been used elsewhere. The researchers also note that this is the only prehistoric culture known to work sapphire. ==Jade work== bi from the Liangzhu culture. The ritual object is a symbol of wealth and military power. The jade from this culture is characterized by finely worked large ritual jades, commonly incised with the taotie motif. The most exemplary artifacts from the culture were its cong (cylinders). The largest cong discovered weighed 3.5 kg. Bi (discs) and Yue axes (ceremonial axes) were also found. Jade pendants were also found, designed with engraved representations of small birds, turtles and fish. Many Liangzhu jade artefacts had a white milky bone-like aspect due to its tremolite rock origin and influence of water-based fluids at the burial sites, although jade made from actinolite and serpentine were also commonly found. Most of Liangzhu's contemporaries have some jades, but 90 per cent of all the cong and bi jades recovered, and by far the best in quality, are from Liangzhu sites. Jade artifacts unearthed from Liangzhu sites are said to have been influential on the development of other neolithic cultures in China: \\"The impactful legacy of Liangzhu Culture is seen in Longshan in Shandong, Taosi in Shanxi, Qijia in Ganqing and many other sites in northern Shaanxi, where cong tubes, bi disks and other jade objects reminiscent of Liangzhu Culture have been unearthed.\\" Liangzhu jade work is also said to have had a lasting influence on ritual objects in later periods of Chinese culture. The Liangzhu \\"ancient city\\" or Liangzhu site-complex controlled the best jade products, but less important centers also produced elite crafts, which lead researchers to believe the Liangzhu culture was not a simple pyramid structure society in terms of status levels. Many minor centers had access to their own jade (nephrite). However, the Liangzhu elites at the ancient city communicated and exchanged goods with elites from other parts of the Liangzhu world (and also in other regions of Longshan-era China) and set the criteria of what jade should look like. The Liangzhu did not seem to be importers of jade, even though they did export it extensively. ==Religion== A neolithic altar from the Liangzhu culture, excavated at Yaoshan in Zhejiang, demonstrates that religious structures were elaborate and made of carefully positioned piles of stones and rock walls: this indicates that religion was of considerable importance. The altar has three levels, the highest being a platform of rammed earth. Three additional platforms were paved with cobblestones. There are the remains of a stone wall. On the altar are twelve graves in two rows. Some scholars claim that ritual sacrifice of slaves was part of the Liangzhu tradition. ==Genetic studies== A 2007 analysis of the DNA recovered from human remains in archeological sites of prehistoric peoples along the Yangtze River shows high frequencies of Haplogroup O1 (Y-DNA) in the Liangzhu culture, linking them to Austronesian and Tai-Kadai peoples. The Liangzhu culture existed in coastal areas around the mouth of the Yangtze. Haplogroup O1 was absent in other archeological sites inland. The authors of the study suggest that this may be evidence of two different human migration routes during the peopling of Eastern Asia, one coastal and the other inland, with little genetic flow between them. ==See also== * Liangzhu Culture Museum * List of Neolithic cultures of China * Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors ==ReferencesFootnotes=Sources=== * Allan, Sarah (ed), The Formation of Chinese Civilization: An Archaeological Perspective, * Zhou Ying, \\"The Dawn of the Oriental Civilization: Liangzhu site and Liangzhu culture\\", , China Intercontinental Press, Beijing, 2007 (in both Chinese & English).

Spitting cherry pits is an amateur sport; there are no known professional leagues of cherry spitters. There are multiple international competitions for cherry pit spitting in countries such as the US, Canada, Germany and France. The sport can be traced back many decades. In most competitions a contestant is given a cherry; this is done to prevent cheating or pit tampering, seen in the Witzenhausen competition in which cherry pits were tampered with. The pit is accessed by eating the cherry around it, then the cherry seed is spat. The pit of a cherry is very small, about the size of a front tooth, and is very slippery when first removed from the cherry, making it easy to spit. According to the Guinness Book of Records, the record cherry pit spitting distance is , set in 2004 by Brian \\"Young Gun\\" Krause. == Notable contests  International Cherry Pit-Spitting Championship, Eau Claire, Michigan === The international Cherry Pit-Spitting Championship held in Eau Claire, Michigan was founded in 1974 by Herb Teichman, the owner of the Tree-mendus Fruit Farm to raise awareness for both his farm and the Tart cherry harvest. The contest ran for 45 years from 1974 until 2019 as the farm where the contest takes place has since been sold, thus ending the Michigan competition. Each contestant is allowed to pick three cherries and one at a time, chew around the cherry pit. They then stand with their feet against a line and spit the cherry seed as far in front of them as they can. The contestant is given three attempts then their longest spit is measured. The competition has multiple categories to compete in including the adult male and female categories as well as the youth categories of youth under 5, youth 6‚Äì8 and youth 9‚Äì12 categories. It was at this competition where Brian \\"Young Gun\\" Krause claimed his Guinness World Record in 2004 for the longest distance to spit a cherry pit. === Canadian National Pit Spit Championship === The Canadian National Pit Spit Championship is held annually as a part of the Blenheim Cherry Fest. The competition has been a part of the festival since 1981. The contest originated at a cherry fest run by the Cedar Springs Cherry Co-operative, however in 1994 the farming town of Blenheim took over and joined with the July sidewalk sale. === Witzenhausen Cherry Pip Spitting Competition === The German town of Witzenhausen in Germany, a large producer of the countries cherries is also home to a cherry pip spit competition in their annual cherry fair. In addition to the annual competition there is a lane for cherry spitting which remains year round at Diebesturm. The Witzenhausen Cherry pit spit competition was previously involved in a scandal regarding cherry pit tampering. The head of the Witzenhausen organising committee Ulrich Walger said: \\"After the competition we found manipulated cherry stones on the spitting range\\". Further inquiry revealed that a competitor has slit open the pip then inserted metal shots and covered it with a filler then varnish. The organisers were unable to identify the culprit and as a result annulled the champions. === Young NSW National Cherry Festival === The annual National Cherry festival in Young NSW features a cherry pip spitting competition, held in early December every year. Contestants are required to pick a cherry randomly from a box then spit the cherry pip as far as possible. Young NSW is known as the cherry capital of Australia, responsible for over 60% of all Australian cherries. There is a junior and senior division, with cash prizes of $50 AUD for the junior category and $100 AUD for the senior category. The 2019 competition had close to 60 entrants participated, each contestant was given 2 pips to spit. Simon Taboury won the men's division with a distance of , Cherie McAllister won the ladies title by spitting her pip and Ronan Winfield won the children's category with a distance of . === Manjimup Cherry Spit === The Manjimup cherry spit competition is an annual event at the Manjimup Cherry Harmony Festival, an annual festival since 2001 in Western Australia, attracting between 7000 and 8000 people in 2017. The cherry festival is held in December and celebrates the start of the Cherry season. The cherry pip spitting contest is made of a round of heats and then finals later in the day. The event is sponsored by GlobeVista, who has previously provided the winner of the cherry pip spitting contest to New Zealand to compete for the title of Australasian Cherry Pip Spit Champion. Clinton Thompson, a Perth resident has won the competition multiple times including the 2012, 2014 and 2017 competitions. An ABC news article states that the 2014 prize was \\"a ticket to the festival's Long Table Lunch, $150 in cash and a ticket to New Zealand to compete in the New Zealand Cherry Pip Spitting Competition\\". In 2017, Manjimups victor Clayton Ellis was sponsored by GlobeVista to compete in the New Zealand Olive Stone Spitting competition, which replaced the cherry stone spitting competition after a relocation of the annual Hilux New Zealand Rural Games from \\"the cherry capital in Central Otago to Palmerston North\\" Ellis claimed the national record at the New Zealand Olive Stone Spitting competition with a winning distance of . === Western Regional Cherry Pit Spit === The Western Regional Cherry Pit Spit is an annual contest held at Rowley's Red Barn in Utah, USA, that has been running since 2007. The competition includes two heats, the first round is open to all and includes a male and female division as well as youth age group divisions of 5 and under, 6‚Äì8 years, 9‚Äì12 years and 13‚Äì15 years. The finals round includes the top 10 spitters from the male and female entrant and the top 5 spitters from the youth age group divisions. === Annakirmes (St. Anne‚Äôs Fair) === The Annakirmes or St Anne's Fair is held annually in D√ºren Germany. The fair began in 1715 and the first world championship of cherry-pit-long-spitting at the festival occurred in 1974 on a police dogs training ground. The cherry pit spitting event celebrated its 40th anniversary in 2014 and held a special event for selected teams. === C√©ret Cherry Festival === Cherry pit spitting in C√©ret The C√©ret Cherry Festival occurs annually in France at the end of May, including a cherry stone spitting competition as well as music, dancing and food. == Notable contestants == There are many notable contestants and champions within the different competitions held around the world. Rick \\"Pellet Gun\\" Krause is a 19-time champion cherry pit spitter at the International Cherry Pit-Spitting Championship in Michigan in which he has competed for 40 years. Marlene Krause, wife of Rick ‚ÄúPellet Gun‚Äù Krause, is a seven-time winner of the women's contest at the International Cherry Pit-Spitting Championship competition at the Tree-mendus fruit farm in Eau Claire, Michigan. She and her husband both won consecutively in 2009 and 2010. Brian \\"Young Gun\\" Krause is best known for being the current Guinness world record holder for the longest distance to spit a cherry pit for a distance of at the 2004 International Cherry Pit-Spitting championship in Eau Claire, Michigan USA. \\"Gentleman Joe\\" Lessard Sr. is a well-known competitor in both the Eau Claire, Michigan and Blenheim, Ontario competitions. In 2013 he was a 3-time champion of the International cherry Pit-Spitting Championship in Michigan. He won his three titles in 1986, 1993 and 1996 with a distance of Kevin Bartz is well known for being the 2019 international cherry pit spitting champion in 2019 with a distance of ; he began competition at age ten and won the youth division as well as being the men's division champion twice. Chloe Bartz is the daughter of Kevin Bartz and is a three time international women's division champion, most recently in 2019. Martin Salter \\"The Phantom of the Orchard\\" was the winner of the Canadian Pit Spit Championship in 2001 with a distance of and placed fourth in the International competition held in Michigan the same year. He won his first Canadian title in 1992 and gained his nickname as he used to wear a costume. Clinton Thompson was the winner of the Manjimup Cherry Spit in Young NSW three times, in 2012, 2014 and 2017. As a result of his 2014 victory, he was flown to New Zealand to compete in the New Zealand Cherry Pip Spitting Competition. Clayton Ellis is the winner of the 2016 Manjimup Cherry Spit with a distance of 9.2m. He is also the victor of the 2017 New Zealand Olive Stone Spitting competition, with a distance of 12.64m. == Guinness World Record == The Guinness World Record for the \\"Greatest distance to spit a cherry stone\\" is held by Brian \\"Young Gun\\" Krause for a spit of at the 2004 International Cherry Pit-Spitting championship in Eau Claire, Michigan. Krause also competed in the freestyle competition on the same day where he spat a stone , unofficially beating his own record. == Media coverage == Cherry pit spitting has been covered frequently in the media including news and television coverage. The 46th Annual International Cherry Pit spitting competition held in Michigan in 2019 was streamed live on ESPN OCHO in March 2020. This was aired in a 24-hour slot in which many miscellaneous sports were played in light of the COVID-19 pandemic causing the suspension and cancellation of many other sporting leagues. The Annual International Cherry Pit spitting competition in Michigan has also been featured on the website of The Wall Street Journal. and in an article on ESPN about the competition and the Bartz family. ==References== == External links == *International Cherry Pit Spitting Championship (Library of Congress American Folklife Center Local Legacies) *Official Cherry Pit-Spitting Handbook Category:Individual sports Category:Cherries ","title":"Cherry pit spitting"},{"id":"526042","text":"90377 Sedna, or simply Sedna, is a large planetoid in the outer reaches of the Solar System that was, , at a distance of about from the Sun, about three times as far as Neptune. Spectroscopy has revealed that Sedna's surface composition is similar to those of some other trans-Neptunian objects, being largely a mixture of water, methane, and nitrogen ices with tholins. Its surface is one of the reddest among Solar System objects. It is a possible dwarf planet. Sedna is approximately tied with and as the largest planetoid not known to have a moon. For most of its orbit, it is even farther from the Sun than at present, with its aphelion estimated at 937 AU (31 times Neptune's distance, or about 1.5% of a light-year), making it one of the most distant- known objects in the Solar System other than long-period comets.The extreme trans-Neptunian object has a period of ~50,000 years, and small Solar System bodies such as , , , , , and several comets (such as the Great Comet of 1577) also have larger heliocentric orbits. Of the latter, only , , and have a perihelion point farther than Jupiter's orbit, so it is debatable whether or not most of these objects are misclassified comets. Sedna has an exceptionally long and elongated orbit, taking approximately 11,400 years to complete and a distant point of closest approach to the Sun at 76 AU. These facts have led to much speculation about its origin. The Minor Planet Center currently places Sedna in the scattered disc, a group of objects sent into highly elongated orbits by the gravitational influence of Neptune. This classification has been contested because its perihelion is too large for it to have been scattered by a known planet, leading some astronomers to informally refer to it as the first known member of the inner Oort cloud. Others speculate that it might have been tugged into its current orbit by a passing star, perhaps one within the Sun's birth cluster (an open cluster), or even that it was captured from another star system. Another hypothesis suggests that its orbit may be evidence for a large planet beyond the orbit of Neptune. Astronomer Michael E. Brown, co-discoverer of Sedna and numerous other possible dwarf planets, thinks that it is the most scientifically important trans-Neptunian object found to date, because understanding its unusual orbit is likely to yield valuable information about the origin and early evolution of the Solar System.Chang, Kenneth, Ninth Planet May Exist Beyond Pluto, Scientists Report, The New York Times, 21 January 2016, page A1 == History  Discovery === Sedna (provisionally designated ') was discovered by Michael Brown (Caltech), Chad Trujillo (Gemini Observatory), and David Rabinowitz (Yale University) on 14 November 2003. The discovery formed part of a survey begun in 2001 with the Samuel Oschin telescope at Palomar Observatory near San Diego, California, using Yale's 160-megapixel Palomar Quest camera. On that day, an object was observed to move by 4.6 arcseconds over 3.1 hours relative to stars, which indicated that its distance was about 100 AU. Follow-up observations were made in November‚ÄìDecember 2003 with the SMARTS telescope at Cerro Tololo Inter- American Observatory in Chile, the Tenagra IV telescope in Nogales, Arizona, and the Keck Observatory on Mauna Kea in Hawaii. Combining those with precovery observations taken at the Samuel Oschin telescope in August 2003, and from the Near-Earth Asteroid Tracking consortium in 2001‚Äì2002, allowed accurate determination of its orbit. The calculations showed that the object was moving along a distant highly eccentric orbit, at a distance of 90.3 AU from the Sun. Precovery images have later been found in images of the Palomar Digitized Sky Survey dating back to 25 September 1990. === Naming === Brown initially nicknamed Sedna \\"The Flying Dutchman\\", or \\"Dutch\\", after a legendary ghost ship, because its slow movement had initially masked its presence from his team. For an official name for the object, Brown settled on \\"Sedna\\", a name from Inuit mythology, which Brown chose partly because the Inuit were the closest polar culture to his home in Pasadena, and partly because the name, unlike Quaoar, would be easily pronounceable. On his website, he wrote: Brown also suggested to the International Astronomical Union's (IAU) Minor Planet Center that any future objects discovered in Sedna's orbital region should also be named after entities in arctic mythologies. The team made the name \\"Sedna\\" public before the object had been officially numbered. Brian Marsden, the head of the Minor Planet Center, said that such an action was a violation of protocol, and that some members of the IAU might vote against it. No objection was raised to the name, and no competing names were suggested. The IAU's Committee on Small Body Nomenclature accepted the name in September 2004, and also considered that, in similar cases of extraordinary interest, it might in the future allow names to be announced before they were officially numbered. == Orbit and rotation == alt=The orbit of Sedna lies well beyond these objects, and extends many times their distances from the Sun The 10,000 year apparent magnitudes of Sedna and two other sednoids Sedna has the second longest orbital period of any known object in the Solar System of comparable size or larger, calculated at around 11,400 years. Its orbit is extremely eccentric, with an aphelion estimated at 937 AU and a perihelion at about 76 AU. This perihelion was the largest of that of any known Solar System object until the discovery of . At its aphelion, Sedna orbits the Sun at a mere 1.3% of Earth's orbital speed. When Sedna was discovered it was 89.6 AU from the Sun approaching perihelion, and was the most distant object in the Solar System observed. Sedna was later surpassed by Eris, which was detected by the same survey near aphelion at 97 AU. The orbits of some long-period comets extend farther than that of Sedna; they are too dim to be discovered except when approaching perihelion in the inner Solar System. Even as Sedna nears its perihelion in mid-2076, the Sun would appear merely as an extremely bright star-like pinpoint in its sky, 100 times brighter than a full moon on Earth (for comparison, the Sun appears from Earth to be roughly 400,000 times brighter than the full Moon), and too far away to be visible as a disc to the naked eye. When first discovered, Sedna was thought to have an unusually long rotational period (20 to 50 days). It was initially speculated that Sedna's rotation was slowed by the gravitational pull of a large binary companion, similar to Pluto's moon Charon. A search for such a satellite by the Hubble Space Telescope in March 2004 found nothing, and subsequent measurements from the MMT telescope suggest a much shorter rotation period of about 10 hours, more typical for a body of its size. == Physical characteristics == Artist's visualization of Sedna. All that is known about Sedna is that it has a reddish hue. Sedna has a V-band absolute magnitude (H) of about 1.8, and it is estimated to have an albedo of about 0.32, thus giving it a diameter of approximately 1,000 km. At the time of its discovery it was the intrinsically brightest object found in the Solar System since Pluto in 1930. In 2004, the discoverers placed an upper limit of 1,800 km on its diameter, but by 2007 this was revised downward to less than 1,600 km after observation by the Spitzer Space Telescope. In 2012, measurements from the Herschel Space Observatory suggested that Sedna's diameter was , which would make it smaller than Pluto's moon Charon. Because Sedna has no known moons, determining its mass is currently impossible without sending a space probe. Sedna is currently the largest trans-Neptunian Sun-orbiting object not known to have a satellite. Only a single attempt has been made to find a satellite, and it has been suggested that there is a chance of up to 25% that a satellite could have been missed. Observations from the SMARTS telescope show that in visible light Sedna is one of the reddest objects in the Solar System, nearly as red as Mars. Chad Trujillo and his colleagues suggest that Sedna's dark red colour is caused by a surface coating of hydrocarbon sludge, or tholin, formed from simpler organic compounds after long exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Its surface is homogeneous in colour and spectrum; this may be because Sedna, unlike objects nearer the Sun, is rarely impacted by other bodies, which would expose bright patches of fresh icy material like that on 8405 Asbolus. Sedna and two other very distant objects ‚Äì and ‚Äì share their color with outer classical Kuiper belt objects and the centaur 5145 Pholus, suggesting a similar region of origin. Trujillo and colleagues have placed upper limits in Sedna's surface composition of 60% for methane ice and 70% for water ice. The presence of methane further supports the existence of tholins on Sedna's surface, because they are produced by irradiation of methane. Barucci and colleagues compared Sedna's spectrum with that of Triton and detected weak absorption bands belonging to methane and nitrogen ices. From these observations, they suggested the following model of the surface: 24% Triton- type tholins, 7% amorphous carbon, 10% nitrogen ices, 26% methanol, and 33% methane. The detection of methane and water ices was confirmed in 2006 by the Spitzer Space Telescope mid-infrared photometry. The presence of nitrogen on the surface suggests the possibility that, at least for a short time, Sedna may have a tenuous atmosphere. During a 200-year period near perihelion, the maximum temperature on Sedna should exceed , the transition temperature between alpha-phase solid N2 and the beta-phase seen on Triton. At 38 K, the N2 vapor pressure would be 14 microbar (1.4 Pa or 0.000014 atm). Its deep red spectral slope is indicative of high concentrations of organic material on its surface, and its weak methane absorption bands indicate that methane on Sedna's surface is ancient, rather than freshly deposited. This means that Sedna is too cold for methane to evaporate from its surface and then fall back as snow, which happens on Triton and probably on Pluto. Models of internal heating via radioactive decay suggest that Sedna might be capable of supporting a subsurface ocean of liquid water. == Origin == In their paper announcing the discovery of Sedna, Mike Brown and his colleagues described it as the first observed body belonging to the Oort cloud, the hypothetical cloud of comets thought to exist nearly a light-year from the Sun. They observed that, unlike scattered disc objects such as Eris, Sedna's perihelion (76 AU) is too distant for it to have been scattered by the gravitational influence of Neptune. Because it is a great deal closer to the Sun than was expected for an Oort cloud object, and has an inclination roughly in line with the planets and the Kuiper belt, they described the planetoid as being an \\"inner Oort cloud object\\", situated in the disc reaching from the Kuiper belt to the spherical part of the cloud. If Sedna formed in its current location, the Sun's original protoplanetary disc must have extended as far as 75 AU into space. Also, Sedna's initial orbit must have been approximately circular, otherwise its formation by the accretion of smaller bodies into a whole would not have been possible, because the large relative velocities between planetesimals would have been too disruptive. Therefore, it must have been tugged into its current eccentric orbit by a gravitational interaction with another body. In their initial paper, Brown, Rabinowitz and colleagues suggested three possible candidates for the perturbing body: an unseen planet beyond the Kuiper belt, a single passing star, or one of the young stars embedded with the Sun in the stellar cluster in which it formed. Mike Brown and his team favored the hypothesis that Sedna was lifted into its current orbit by a star from the Sun's birth cluster, arguing that Sedna's aphelion of about 1,000 AU, which is relatively close compared to those of long-period comets, is not distant enough to be affected by passing stars at their current distances from the Sun. They propose that Sedna's orbit is best explained by the Sun having formed in an open cluster of several stars that gradually disassociated over time. That hypothesis has also been advanced by both Alessandro Morbidelli and Scott Jay Kenyon. Computer simulations by Julio A. Fernandez and Adrian Brunini suggest that multiple close passes by young stars in such a cluster would pull many objects into Sedna-like orbits. A study by Morbidelli and Levison suggested that the most likely explanation for Sedna's orbit was that it had been perturbed by a close (approximately 800 AU) pass by another star in the first 100 million years or so of the Solar System's existence. The trans-Neptunian planet hypothesis has been advanced in several forms by a number of astronomers, including Rodney Gomes and Patryk Lykawka. One scenario involves perturbations of Sedna's orbit by a hypothetical planetary-sized body in the Hills cloud. Recent simulations show that Sedna's orbital traits could be explained by perturbations by a Neptune-mass object at 2,000 AU (or less), a Jupiter-mass () at 5,000 AU, or even an Earth-mass object at 1,000 AU. Computer simulations by Patryk Lykawka have suggested that Sedna's orbit may have been caused by a body roughly the size of Earth, ejected outward by Neptune early in the Solar System's formation and currently in an elongated orbit between 80 and 170 AU from the Sun. Mike Brown's various sky surveys have not detected any Earth-sized objects out to a distance of about 100 AU. It is possible that such an object may have been scattered out of the Solar System after the formation of the inner Oort cloud. Caltech researchers Konstantin Batygin and Mike Brown have hypothesised the existence of a giant planet in the outer Solar System, nicknamed Planet Nine. The planet would be about 10 times as massive as Earth. It would have a highly eccentric orbit, and its average distance from the Sun would be about 20 times that of Neptune (which orbits at an average distance of ). Its orbital period would be 10,000 to 20,000 years. The planet's existence was hypothesised using mathematical modeling and computer simulations, but it has not been observed directly. It may explain the orbits of a group of objects that includes Sedna. It has been suggested that Sedna's orbit is the result of influence by a large binary companion to the Sun, thousands of AU distant. One such hypothetical companion is Nemesis, a dim companion to the Sun that has been proposed to be responsible for the supposed periodicity of mass extinctions on Earth from cometary impacts, the lunar impact record, and the common orbital elements of a number of long-period comets. No direct evidence of Nemesis has been found, and many lines of evidence (such as crater counts) have thrown its existence into doubt. John J. Matese and Daniel P. Whitmire, longtime proponents of the possibility of a wide binary companion to the Sun, have suggested that an object of lying at roughly 7,850 AU from the Sun could produce a body in Sedna's orbit. Morbidelli and Kenyon have also suggested that Sedna did not originate in the Solar System, but was captured by the Sun from a passing extrasolar planetary system, specifically that of a brown dwarf about 1/20th the mass of the Sun () or a main-sequence star 80 percent more massive than our Sun, which, owing to its larger mass, may now be a white dwarf. In either case, the stellar encounter had likely occurred early after the Sun's formation, about less than 100 million years after the Sun had formed.https://www.universetoday.com/121637/stealing-sedna/ Stellar encounters during this time would have minimal effect on the Oort cloud's final mass and population since the Sun had excess material for replenishing the Oort cloud population. == Population == Artist's conception of the surface of Sedna, with the alt=the Sun appears merely as a point of light, distended by dust. The surface of Sedna is red ice, dimly glimmering in the noontime sunlight Sedna's highly elliptical orbit means that the probability of its detection was roughly 1 in 80, which suggests that, unless its discovery was a fluke, another 40‚Äì120 Sedna-sized objects would exist within the same region. Another object, , has a similar but less extreme orbit: it has a perihelion of 44.3 AU, an aphelion of 394 AU, and an orbital period of 3,240 years. It may have been affected by the same processes as Sedna. Each of the proposed mechanisms for Sedna's extreme orbit would leave a distinct mark on the structure and dynamics of any wider population. If a trans-Neptunian planet was responsible, all such objects would share roughly the same perihelion (about 80 AU). If Sedna were captured from another planetary system that rotated in the same direction as the Solar System, then all of its population would have orbits on relatively low inclinations and have semi-major axes ranging from 100 to 500 AU. If it rotated in the opposite direction, then two populations would form, one with low and one with high inclinations. The perturbations from passing stars would produce a wide variety of perihelia and inclinations, each dependent on the number and angle of such encounters. Acquiring a larger sample of such objects would help in determining which scenario is most likely. \\"I call Sedna a fossil record of the earliest Solar System\\", said Brown in 2006. \\"Eventually, when other fossil records are found, Sedna will help tell us how the Sun formed and the number of stars that were close to the Sun when it formed.\\" A 2007‚Äì2008 survey by Brown, Rabinowitz and Megan Schwamb attempted to locate another member of Sedna's hypothetical population. Although the survey was sensitive to movement out to 1,000 AU and discovered the likely dwarf planet Gonggong, it detected no new sednoid. Subsequent simulations incorporating the new data suggested about 40 Sedna-sized objects probably exist in this region, with the brightest being about Eris's magnitude (‚àí1.0). In 2014, astronomers announced the discovery of , an object half the size of Sedna in a 4,200-year orbit similar to Sedna's and a perihelion within Sedna's range of roughly 80 AU, which led some to speculate that it offered evidence of a trans-Neptunian planet. == Classification == Sedna compared to some other very distant orbiting bodies The Minor Planet Center, which officially catalogs the objects in the Solar System, classifies Sedna as a scattered object. This grouping is heavily questioned, and many astronomers have suggested that it, together with a few other objects (e.g. ), be placed in a new category of distant objects named extended scattered disc objects (E-SDO), detached objects, distant detached objects (DDO), or scattered- extended in the formal classification by the Deep Ecliptic Survey. The discovery of Sedna resurrected the question of which astronomical objects should be considered planets and which should not. On 15 March 2004, articles on Sedna in the popular press reported that a tenth planet had been discovered. This question was answered under the International Astronomical Union definition of a planet, adopted on 24 August 2006, which mandated that a planet must have cleared the neighborhood around its orbit. Sedna has a Stern‚ÄìLevison parameter estimated to be much less than 1, and therefore cannot be considered to have cleared the neighborhood, even though no other objects have yet been discovered in its vicinity. To be a dwarf planet, Sedna must be in hydrostatic equilibrium. It is bright enough, and therefore large enough, that this is expected to be the case, and several astronomers have called it one.Rabinowitz, Schaefer, Tourtellotte, 2011. \\"SMARTS Studies of the Composition and Structure of Dwarf Planets\\". Bulletin of the American Astronomical Society, Vol. 43Malhotra, 2010. \\"On the Importance of a Few Dwarf Planets\\". Bulletin of the American Astronomical Society, Vol. 41 == Exploration == Sedna will come to perihelion around 2075‚Äì2076. This close approach to the Sun provides an opportunity for study that will not occur again for 12,000 years. Although Sedna is listed on NASA's Solar System exploration website, NASA is not known to be considering any type of mission at this time. It was calculated that a flyby mission to Sedna could take 24.48 years using a Jupiter gravity assist, based on launch dates of 6 May 2033 or 23 June 2046. Sedna would be 77.27 or 76.43 AU from the Sun when the spacecraft arrived near the end of 2057 or 2073, respectively. In May 2018, astrophysicist Ethan Siegel publicly advocated for a space probe mission to study Sedna as it approaches perihelion. Siegel characterized Sedna as an attractive target due to its status as a possible inner Oort cloud object. Because of Sedna's long orbital period, \\"we will not get the opportunity to study it this close to the Sun for many millennia again.\\" Such a mission could be facilitated by Dual-Stage 4-Grid ion thrusters that might cut cruise times considerably if powered, for example, by a fusion reactor. == Notes == == References == == External links == * * NASA's Sedna page (Discovery Photos) * Mike Brown's Sedna page * 20031114 Sedna Sedna Sedna Category:Extreme trans- Neptunian objects Sedna Sedna Category:Possible dwarf planets Category:Sednoids ","title":"90377 Sedna"},{"id":"526044","text":"Thrall-Demonsweatlive is an EP by Danzig. It was released in 1993 on Def American Recordings and has been certified Platinum. ==Music and recording== The EP is split into two sections. The first section, Thrall, consists of three new studio recordings that were tracked live and completed by the band in a single day. The studio recording \\"Trouble\\" is a cover of the Elvis Presley song featured in the movie King Creole. Glenn Danzig had previously recorded the song with Samhain, which was later released on the box set version of their Final Descent EP. The second section, Demonsweatlive, includes four live recordings taken from the band's Halloween 1992 performance at the Irvine Meadows Amphitheater in California. From the fourth pressing on, the CD releases have a hidden track featuring the remixed studio version of \\"Mother\\", titled \\"Mother '93\\". Symbolically, the song is hidden at track number 93, and the total length of the blank tracks leading to the song is 7 minutes and 6 seconds (6 minutes and 66 seconds). ==Artwork and packaging== The cover artwork is by artist Simon Bisley. The EP was issued as a picture- disc CD and LP in Europe. Like Danzig's four studio albums with the original lineup, this EP was given a Parental Advisory label despite the absence of common profanity. ==Music videos== Music videos were released for the songs \\"Mother '93\\" and \\"It's Coming Down\\". The \\"Mother '93\\" music video was a success on MTV. As a result, \\"Mother\\" became Danzig's most well known song; its popularity helping both the EP and the band's debut album to reach Gold status in 1994, and later Platinum status. The uncensored version of the \\"It's Coming Down\\" music video was banned by music channels, including MTV, due to its sexually explicit content. The music video depicts various acts of bondage, sadomasochism, and cock and ball torture. The video was directed by Jon Reiss and features an appearance by performance artist Bob Flanagan, both known for their video work with Nine Inch Nails. Eerie Von explained the concept behind the music video: ‚ÄúIt was part of mine and Glenn's personalities, part of what we used to see when we lived in New York. The director also had some good ideas, and we let him do what he wanted. I like stuff that people think is bizarre. It was pretty heavy, but so what?

MacArthur is a successful solo long-distance yachtswoman. On 7 February 2005 she broke the world record for the fastest solo circumnavigation of the globe, a feat which gained her international renown. Francis Joyon, the Frenchman who had held the record before MacArthur, was able to recover the record again in early 2008. Following her retirement from professional sailing on 2 September 2010, MacArthur announced the launch of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a charity that works with business and education to accelerate the transition to a circular economy. == Early life == MacArthur was born in Derbyshire where she lived with her parents, who were both teachers, and two brothers Fergus, still in Whatstandwell, and Lewis, who now lives in Pennsylvania. She acquired her early interest in sailing, firstly by her desire to emulate her idol at the time, Sophie Burke, and secondly by reading Arthur Ransome's Swallows and Amazons series of books. She has since become the Patron of the Nancy Blackett Trust which owns and operates Ransome's yacht, Nancy Blackett. Her first experience of sailing was on a boat owned by her aunt Thea MacArthur on the east coast of England. She saved her school dinner money for three years to buy her first boat, an eight-foot dinghy, which she named Threp'ny Bit even though decimalisation had taken place before she was born. She sellotaped a real 'threepenny bit' coin onto the bow. MacArthur attended Wirksworth County Infants and Junior Schools and the Anthony Gell School and also worked at a sailing school in Hull.Daily Mail Weekend Interview. 20 May 2012, p6 When she was 17, MacArthur bought a Corribee and named it Iduna; she described the first moment she saw it as \\"love at first sight\\". In 1995 she sailed Iduna single-handed on a circumnavigation of Great Britain. In 1997 she finished 17th in the Mini Transat solo transatlantic race after fitting out her 21 ft (6.4 m) Classe Mini yacht Le Poisson herself while living in a French boatyard. She was named 1998 British Telecom/Royal Yachting Association \\"Yachtsman of The Year\\" in the UK and \\"Sailing's Young Hope\\" in France. Asteroid 20043 Ellenmacarthur is named after her. (now moved to http://www.ipa.nw.ru/PAGE/FUNDAMENTAL/LSBSS/englenam.htm ) == Racing career == MacArthur first came to general prominence in 2001 when she came second in the Vend√©e Globe solo round-the-world sailing race in her Owen Clarke/Rob Humphreys designed Kingfisher (named after her sponsors, Kingfisher plc), and subsequently MacArthur was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for services to sport. At 24, she was the youngest competitor to complete the voyage. In 2003, she captained a round-the-world record attempt for a crewed yacht in Kingfisher 2 (a catamaran formerly owned by Bruno Peyron and known as Orange), but was thwarted by a broken mast in the Southern Ocean. Ellen MacArthur on her arrival in 2005 A trimaran named B&Q;/Castorama (after two companies in the Kingfisher group) unveiled in January 2004, was specially designed by Nigel Irens and Benoit Cabaret for her to break solo records. The 75-foot (23 m) trimaran was built in Australia, with many of the components specifically arranged to take into account MacArthur's 5-foot 2 inch (1.57 m) height. Using the yacht, her first significant record attempt in 2004 to break the west‚Äìeast transatlantic crossing time failed by around one and a quarter hours, after over seven days of sailing. She began her attempt to break the solo record for sailing non-stop around the world on 28 November 2004. During her circumnavigation, she set records for the fastest solo voyage to the equator, past the Cape of Good Hope, past Cape Horn and back to the equator again. She crossed the finishing line near the French coast at Ushant at 22:29 UTC on 7 February 2005 beating the previous record set by French sailor Francis Joyon by 1 day, 8 hours, 35 minutes, 49 seconds. Her time of 71 days, 14 hours, 18 minutes 33 seconds is world record for the covered. This is an average speed of . On 8 February 2005, following her return to England, it was announced that she was to be made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in recognition of her achievement. It is believed that she is the youngest ever recipient of this honour. Coming immediately after the event being recognised, rather than appearing in due course in the New Year's or Birthday Honours lists, this recognition was reminiscent of accolades previously bestowed upon Francis Drake and Francis Chichester when reaching home shores after their respective circumnavigations in 1580 and 1967. MacArthur was also granted the rank of Honorary Lieutenant Commander, Royal Naval Reserve on the same day. In recognition of her achievement she was appointed a Knight (Chevalier) of the French Legion of Honour by President Nicolas Sarkozy in March 2008. She is a fluent French speaker. In 2007 MacArthur headed up BT Team Ellen, a three-person sailing team which includes Australian Nick Moloney and Frenchman S√©bastien Josse. In October 2009 MacArthur announced her intention to retire from competitive racing to concentrate on the subject of resource and energy use in the global economy. On 2 September 2010, she launched the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a charity focusing on accelerating the transition to a regenerative circular economy. The Foundation works in three areas: * Education ‚Äì inspiring a generation to re-think the future * Business ‚Äì catalysing business innovation * Insight ‚Äì the opportunity for a re-design revolution == Records == In June 2000, MacArthur sailed the monohull Kingfisher from Plymouth, UK to Newport, Rhode Island, USA in 14 days, 23 hours, 11 minutes. This is the current record for a single-handed woman monohull east-to-west passage, and also the record for a single-handed woman in any vessel.WSSRC Ratified Passage Records ‚Äì \\"Transatlantic E to W, Plymouth ‚Äì Newport, monohull and woman any vessel\\", from the World Sailing Speed Record Council MacArthur's second place in the 2000‚Äì2001 edition of the Vend√©e Globe, with a time of 94 days, 4 hours and 25 minutes, is the world record for a single-handed, non-stop, monohull circumnavigation by a woman.WSSRC Ratified Passage Records ‚Äì \\"Round the World, non-stop, singlehanded, woman, Vend√©e Globe\\", from the World Sailing Speed Record Council In June 2004, MacArthur sailed her trimaran B&Q;/Castorama from Ambrose Light, Lower New York Bay, USA to Lizard Point, Cornwall, UK in 7 days, 3 hours, 50 minutes. This set a new world record for a transatlantic crossing by women, beating the previous crewed record as well as the singlehanded version.WSSRC Ratified Passage Records ‚Äì \\"Transatlantic W to E outright women, and singlehanded woman\\", from the World Sailing Speed Record Council In 2005, MacArthur beat Francis Joyon's existing world record for a single-handed non-stop circumnavigation. MacArthur in the trimaran B&Q;/Castorama sailed at an average speed of 15.9 knots.WSSRC Ratified Passage Records ‚Äì \\"Round the World, non-stop, singlehanded\\", from the World Sailing Speed Record Council Her time of 71 days, 14 hours, 18 minutes 33 seconds beat Joyon's then world record time by 1 day, 8 hours, 35 minutes and 49 seconds. She had no more than 20 minutes' sleep at a time during the voyage, having to be on constant lookout day and night. On 23 November 2007 Joyon set off in IDEC 2 in an attempt to beat MacArthur's current world record for a single handed circumnavigation. He achieved his goal in 57 days, 13 hours 34 minutes and 6 seconds. Despite Joyon's reclamation of the record, Robin Knox-Johnston still described MacArthur's time as an \\"amazing achievement\\". == Popular culture == In 2009 McArthur appeared on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs. Her chosen book was The SAS Survival Handbook by John \\"Lofty\\" Wiseman and her luxury item was a fluffy worm mascot. MacArthur was also the last record holder on Star in a Reasonably-Priced Car on the BBC's Top Gear television driving programme until the eighth series, when the car and rules were changed, and previous records were removed. The competition was a timed lap of a racetrack in a Suzuki Liana. She completed the lap in 1 minute 46.7 seconds, beating Jimmy Carr by 0.2 seconds. MacArthur won Top Gear's Fastest Driver of the Year award in 2005. She also took part in 2011 TV series Jamie's Dream School. ==Books== In 2002, MacArthur released her first autobiography entitled Taking on the World. Later she wrote Race Against Time, published in 2005, a day-by-day account of her record journey around the world. In September 2010, she published a second autobiography entitled Full Circle. ==CharitiesEllen MacArthur Cancer Trust=== In 2003, MacArthur set up the Ellen MacArthur Trust (now the Ellen MacArthur Cancer Trust), a registered charity, to take young people, aged between 8 and 24 inclusive, sailing to help them regain their confidence on their way to recovery from cancer, leukaemia and other serious illnesses. In 2008 MacArthur joined forces with other sports celebrities to launch an appeal to raise ¬£4 million for the Rainbows children's hospice. The aim is to give terminally ill young people their own customised sleeping unit to enable children in separate age groups to have their families stay with them.\\"Ellen MacArthur in Charity Appeal\\", Charities Aid Foundation, 7 February 2008.

In a joint mission statement, the Commission's presidents, RSF secretary-general Christophe Deloire and Nobel laureate Shirin Ebadi identified a range of factors currently threatening that freedom. This includes: political control of the media, subjugation of news and information to private interests, the growing influence of corporate actors, online mass disinformation and the erosion of quality journalism. This Commission published the International Declaration on Information and Democracy to state principles, define objectives and propose forms of governance for the global online space for information and communication. The Declaration emphasised that corporate entities with a structural function in the global space have duties, especially as regards political and ideological neutrality, pluralism and accountability. It called for recognition of the right to information that is diverse, independent and reliable in order to form opinions freely and participate fully in the democratic debate. At the Paris Peace Forum in 2018, 12 countries launched a political process aimed at providing democratic guarantees for news and information and freedom of opinion, based on the principles set out in the Declaration. === Journalism Trust Initiative === RSF launched the Journalism Trust Initiative (JTI) in 2018 with its partners the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), Agence France Presse (AFP) and the Global Editors Network (GEN). JTI defines indicators for trustworthy journalism and rewards compliance, bringing tangible benefits for all media outlets and supporting them in creating a healthy space for information. JTI distinguishes itself from similar initiatives by focusing on the process of journalism rather than content alone. Media outlets will be expected to comply with standards that include transparency of ownership, sources of revenue and proof of a range of professional safeguards. === Actions === RSF's defence of journalistic freedom includes international missions, the publication of country reports, training of journalists and public protests. Recent global advocacy and practical interventions have included: opening a centre for women journalists in Afghanistan in 2017, a creative protest with street-artist C215 in Strasbourg for Turkish journalists in detention, turning off the Eiffel Tower lights in tribute to murdered Saudi journalist Jamal Kashoggi and providing training to journalists and bloggers in Syria. In July 2018, RSF made an unprecedented mission to Saudi Arabia calling for the release of 30 journalists. The organization publishes a gallery of Predators of Press Freedom, highlighting the most egregious international violators of press freedom. It also maintains an online Press Freedom Barometer, monitoring the number of journalists, media workers and citizen journalists killed or imprisoned. Its programme Operation Collateral Freedom, launched in 2014, provides alternative access to censored websites by creating mirror sites: 22 sites have been unblocked in 12 countries, including Iran, China, Saudi Arabia and Vietnam.

It should not limit the freedom of speech and media and also access to the information, both online and offline. These measures should not be used for restriction of human rights advocates, reporters, media staffs, and institutions of civil societies. == Funding == RSF's budget for 2018 totalled ‚Ç¨6.1m. Fifty per cent of the organization's income comes from public subsidy; 12 per cent from foundations; 24 per cent from the publication of photography books and 9 per cent from public donations. Foundations supporting RSF's work include Adessium, IEDDH (International Cooperation and Development, European Commission), Sida (Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency), and Omidyar. RSF has attracted criticism in previous years for accepting funding from the National Endowment for Democracy in the US and the Center for a Free Cuba. At the time, secretary-general Robert M√©nard pointed out that funding from NED totalled 0.92 per cent of RSF's budget and supported African journalists and their families. RSF ceased its relationship with the Center for a Free Cuba in 2008. == Public profile  Recognition === RSF has received multiple international awards honouring its achievements: * 1992: received the \\"Lorenzo Natali Prize\\" from the European Commission for defending human rights and democracy. * 1997: received the \\"Journalism and Democracy Prize\\" from the Parliament Assembly of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). * 2005: shared the European Parliament's Sakharov Prize for \\"Freedom of Thought\\" with Nigerian human rights lawyer Hauwa Ibrahim and Cuba's Ladies in White movement.\\"Ladies, Ibrahim and Reporters joint Sakharov prize winners\\", European Parliament, 27 June 2006 * 2007: received the \\"Asia Democracy and Human Rights Award\\" from Taiwan Foundation for Democracy and the \\"Dawit Isaak Prize\\" from Swedish Publicists' Association. * 2008: received the \\"Kahlil Gibran Award for Institutional Excellence\\" from the Arab American Institute Foundation. * 2009: shared the \\"Roland Berger Human Dignity Award\\" with Iranian human rights lawyer and Nobel peace laureate Shirin Ebadi. * 2009: received the \\"M√©daille Charlemagne\\" for European Media. * 2012: received the \\"Club Internacional de Prensa\\" Award, in Madrid. * 2013: received the \\"Freedom of Speech Award\\" from the International Association of Press Clubs, in Warsaw.\\"Reporters Without Borders, Laureate of the International Association of Press Clubs Award\\", Reporters Without Borders, 4 June 2013.

RSF denied the allegations of a political agenda, but confirmed that it had received a grant from the National Endowment for Democracy which is funded through the State Department and from the Centre for a Free Cuba. In 2006, online magazine CounterPunch claimed that RSF had falsely linked former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to the murder of journalists and had failed to criticize his successor's crackdown on press freedom. RSF was criticized for supporting media outlets that were in favour of the coup attempt in Venezuela in 2002. In response, RSF pointed out that it had in fact condemned media support of the coup. Otto Reich Lucie Morillon, RWB's then-Washington representative, confirmed in an interview on 29 April 2005 that the organization had a contract with US State Department's Special Envoy to the Western Hemisphere, Otto Reich, who signed it in his capacity as a trustee for the Center for a Free Cuba, to inform Europeans about the repression of journalists in Cuba.Reporters Without Borders Unmasked , Diana Barahona, CounterPunch, 17 May 2005 CounterPunch, a critic of RWB, cited Reich's involvement with the group as a source of controversy: when Reich headed the Reagan administration's Office of Public Diplomacy in the 1980s, the body partook in what its officials termed \\"White Propaganda\\" ‚Äì covert dissemination of information to influence domestic opinion regarding US backing for military campaigns against left-wing governments in Latin America. Cuba RWB has been highly critical of press freedom in Cuba, describing the Cuban government as \\"totalitarian\\", and engages in direct campaigning against it.Reporters Without Borders ordered to pay 6,000 euros to Korda's heir over use of Che photo , Cubanet.org, 12 March 2004 RWB's campaign includes declarations on radio and television, full-page ads in Parisian dailies, posters, leafletting at airports, and an April 2003 occupation of the Cuban tourism office in Paris. A Paris court (tribunal de grande instance) ordered RWB to pay 6,000 Euros to the daughter and heir of Alberto Korda for non-compliance with a court order of 9 July 2003 banning it from using Korda's famous (and copyrighted) photograph of Ernesto \\"Che\\" Guevara in a beret, taken at the funeral of La Coubre victims. RWB said it was \\"relieved\\" it was not given a harsher sentence. English translation: \\"RSF and the photo of 'Che' \\" The face had been superimposed by RWB with that of a May 1968 CRS anti-riot police agent, and the postcard handed out at Orly Airport in Paris to tourists boarding on flights for Cuba. On 24 April 2003, RWB organized a demonstration outside the Cuban embassy in Paris\\"Reporters Without Borders protesters beaten up by Cuban embassy officials\\" , CubaNet, 24 April 2003 RWB, as well as M√©nard himself, in turn has been described as an \\"ultra-reactionary\\" organization by the official newspaper of the Central Committee of the Cuban Communist Party, Granma. Tensions between Cuban authorities and RWB are high, particularly after the imprisonment in 2003 of 75 dissidents (27 journalists) by the Cuban Government, including Ra√∫l Rivero and √ìscar El√≠as Biscet. An article by John Cherian in the Indian magazine Frontline alleged that RWB \\"is reputed to have strong links with Western intelligence agencies\\" and \\"Cuba has accused Robert Meynard [sic] the head of the group, of having CIA links\\".Cherian, John (29 March ‚Äì 11 April 2008). \\"Trouble in Tibet\\" . Frontline. 25(7). RWB has denied that its campaigning on Cuba are related to payments it has received from anti-Castro organisations.\\"Why we take so much interest in Cuba\\" . Reporters Without Borders. 8 July 2005. In 2004, it received $50,000 from the Miami- based exile group, the Center for a Free Cuba, which was personally signed by the US State Department's Special Envoy to the Western Hemisphere, Otto Reich. RWB has also received extensive funding from other institutions long critical of Fidel Castro's government, including the International Republican Institute.Coups d'Etat sans fronti√®res , English translation: \\"Coups Without Borders\\", Maurice Lemoine, Le Monde diplomatique, August 2002 Haiti In 2004, Reporters Without Borders released an annual report on Haiti, saying that a \\"climate of terror\\" existed in which attacks and threats persisted against journalists who were critical of Jean-Bertrand Aristide. An August 2006 article in CounterPunch accused RWB of ignoring similar attacks on journalists under the Latortue government in 2005 and 2006, including that of Pacifica Radio reporter Kevin Pina. Pina himself said: Venezuela Le Monde diplomatique has criticized RWB's attitude towards Hugo Ch√°vez's government in Venezuela, in particular during the 2002 coup attempt. RWB is said to have lent its support for Venezuelan pro-coup media outlets, and have had as a Caracas correspondent Mar√≠a Sol P√©rez-Schael, an opposition adviser. In a right of reply, Robert M√©nard declared that RWB had also condemned the Venezuela media's support of the coup attempt. RWB has also been criticized for supporting Globovision's version of events about its false reporting in relation to a 2009 earthquake, claiming Globovision was \\"being hounded by the government and the administration\\".\\"Reporters Without Borders' Lies about Venezuela\\", Salim Lamrani, English translation by Scott Campbell Les Blough, Axis of Logic, 27 June 2009. RSF has received criticism in relation to historic campaigns. Overemphasis on \\"third-world dictatorships\\"; alleged bias in favor of Europe and the U.S. In 2007 John Rosenthal argued that RWB showed a bias in favor of European countries.\\"The Reporters Without Borders Press Freedom Index: Independent Assessment or EU Propaganda?\\", John Rosenthal, World Politics Review: Part I, 6 November 2007 and Part II, 14 November 2007 In the 2009 article about RWB and Venezuela cited above, Salim Lamrani stated that \\"RSF is not an organization that defends freedom of the press, but is an obscure entity with a political agenda precisely commissioned to discredit through all possible means the progressive governments in the world that find themselves on the United States' blacklist.\\" Reports published in the Council on Hemispheric Affairs and the US Newspaper Guild journal in 2005 criticised RSF for receiving funding from the US government and Cuba opposition groups, and for being part of a ‚Äòneocons crusade‚Äô against the Castro regime. RSF denied the allegations of a political agenda, but confirmed that it had received a grant from the National Endowment for Democracy which is funded through the State Department and from the Centre for a Free Cuba. The Observatoire de l'Action Humanitaire (Centre for Humanitarian Action) criticized RWB's lukewarm criticism of US forces for their shelling, in 2003, of Palestine Hotel, in Baghdad, Iraq, which killed two Reuters journalists. The family of one of the deceased journalists, Spanish citizen Jos√© Couso, refused to allow the Spain chapter of RWB to attach its name to a legal action led by the family against the US Army, voicing disgust at the fact that RWB interviewed US forces responsible for the shelling, but not the surviving journalists, and that RWB showed acquiescence to the US Army by thanking them for their \\"precious help\\". In 2006, online magazine CounterPunch claimed that RSF had falsely linked former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to the murder of journalists and had failed to criticise his successor's crackdown on press freedom. According to the Observatoire, ever since Robert M√©nard was replaced by Jean-Fran√ßois Julliard in September 2008, RWB has been concerned with violations of press freedom not only in \\"third-world dictatorships\\" but also in developed countries like France. Through widening its geographical scope, RWB aims at countering accusations of overly focusing on left-wing regimes unfriendly to the US.Reporters sans fronti√®res (Reporters Without Borders) : List of NGOs Studied in France : NGO Directory , Observatory of humanitarian action, 29 September 2010: \\"Depuis que Jean-Fran√ßois Julliard a remplac√© Robert M√©nard en septembre 2008, l'association [...] ne s'occupe plus seulement des violations des droits de la presse dans les dictatures du tiers- monde et couvre aussi des pays d√©velopp√©s comme la France. Un pareil √©largissement g√©ographique permet notamment √† l'association de r√©agir aux critiques qui l'accusaient de trop se focaliser sur les r√©gimes de gauche hostiles aux Etats-Unis.\\" (\\"Since Jean-Fran√ßois Julliard replaced Robert M√©nard in September 2008, the association [...] is no longer concerned just with violations of media rights in third world dictatorships and now also covers developed countries like France. Such a geographic expansion notably allows the association to respond to critics who accused it of too much focus on leftist regimes hostile to the United States.\\") For example, RWB condemned the 35-year sentence received by American soldier Chelsea Manning, calling it \\"disproportionate\\" and arguing that it reveals how \\"vulnerable\\" whistleblowers are. In April 2019, the RWB stated the arrest of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange could \\"set a dangerous precedent for journalists, whistleblowers, and other journalistic sources that the US may wish to pursue in the future.\\" RSF was criticised for supporting media outlets that were in favour of the coup attempt in Venezuela in 2002. In response, RSF pointed out that it had in fact condemned media support of the coup. UNESCO support for International Online Free Expression Day UNESCO, who initially had granted patronage to the first International Online Free Expression Day to be held on 12 March 2008, withdrew its patronage on the day of the event giving as reasons that RWB \\"published material concerning a number of UNESCO's Member States, which UNESCO had not been informed of and could not endorse\\" and that \\"UNESCO's logo was placed in such a way as to indicate the Organization's support of the information presented.\\" RWB responded in a press release that \\"UNESCO has withdrawn its support to the promotion of this campaign because several of the nations which are part of the list of Internet Enemies published by the nongovernmental organization have directly put pressure to achieve it.\\" == See also == * The Uncensored Library * Avocats Sans Fronti√®res * Chilling effect * Committee to Protect Journalists * Electronic Frontier Foundation * Freedom of speech * Freedom of the Press Foundation * Freedom of the Press report * Internet censorship by country * List of sovereign states in Europe by Press Freedom Index * List of indices of freedom * Media transparency * Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe statistics * Political repression of cyber-dissidents * Technology diffusion *The Coalition For Women In Journalism ==References== ==External links== * Reporters Without Borders web site Category:International human rights organizations Category:International organizations based in France Category:Freedom of expression organizations Category:Organizations established in 1985 Category:International journalism organizations Category:Political advocacy groups in France Category:Internet- related activism Category:1985 establishments in France Category:Sakharov Prize laureates ","title":"Reporters Without Borders"},{"id":"526059","text":"Yakisoba ( ), \\"fried noodle\\", is a Japanese noodle stir-fry dish.

It can be served with a variety of garnishes, such as aonori (seaweed powder), beni sh≈çga (shredded pickled ginger), katsuobushi (bonito fish flakes) or Japanese-style mayonnaise. ==Serving== Yakisoba is most familiarly served on a plate either as a main dish or a side dish. A more novel way of serving yakisoba in Japan is to pile the noodles into a bun sliced down the middle in the style of a hot dog, and garnish the top with mayonnaise and shreds of red pickled ginger. Called yakisoba-pan (pan meaning bread) it is commonly available at konbini (convenience stores). Sometimes udon is used as a replacement for the Chinese-style soba and called yakiudon. This variation originates in Kitakyushu or Kokura in Fukuoka Prefecture. In Okinawa, yakisoba is popular with Okinawans as well as U.S. service members stationed on the island. After the 1945 hostilities with Japan ended on Okinawa, the US military command supplied American food products to the displaced and malnourished islanders. ‚ÄúYakisoba‚Äù was prepared with alternative packaged ingredients such as spaghetti, spam, ketchup, any available vegetable (usually canned), and mayonnaise. Mess halls and other on-base eateries often serve yakisoba. Along with typical Okinawan meats such as pork or chicken, fried Spam, chopped hot dogs, and sliced ham are still popular postwar additions to yakisoba eaten by islanders today, along with common local vegetables such as cabbage and carrots. Okinawa-style yakisoba is generally made with Okinawa soba, a wheat noodle much thicker than what is commonly used for yakisoba in Japan, and flavored with pre-packaged yakisoba sauce. ==Gallery== File:Yakisoba.jpgYakisoba File:Yakisoba_sandwich_by_kaex0r.jpgYakisoba-pan File:Sara_udon_by_Charles_Haynes_in_Bangalore,_India.jpgSara udon variant File:È§ÉÂ≠ê„ÅÆÁéãÂ∞Ü Áöø„ÅÜ„Å©„Çì (4580922222).jpgSara udon from the Gyoza no Ohsho restaurant chain ==See also== * Chow mein * Japanese noodles * Teppanyaki ==References== Category:Fried noodles Category:Japanese noodle dishes ","title":"Yakisoba"},{"id":"526062","text":"George Bubb Dodington, 1st Baron Melcombe (1691 ‚Äì 28 July 1762) was an English whig politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1715 to 1761.

In the course of his career he published several monographs on bird groups and produced a multi-volume catalogue of the specimens in the collection of the museum. He described many new species of bird and also has had species named in his honour by other ornithologists including Sharpe's longclaw (Macronyx sharpei) and Sharpe's starling (Poeoptera sharpii). ==Biography== left Richard was born in London, the first son of Thomas Bowdler Sharpe. His grandfather, Reverend Lancelot Sharpe was Rector of All Hallows Staining. His father was a publisher on Skinner Street and was best known for being the publisher of Sharpe's London Magazine, an illustrated periodical (weekly but monthly from 1847). His care from the age of six was under an aunt, Magdalen Wallace, widow of the headmaster at Grammar School in Sevenoaks and went to school in Brighton. At nine he studied at The King's School, Peterborough receiving a King's Scholarship. He then moved to Loughborough Grammar School. He returned to London at the age of sixteen and worked as a clerk with W. H. Smith & Sons. He already took an interest in ornithology and was interested in writing a monograph on the kingfishers. After two years, in 1865, he joined the company of the bookseller Bernard Quaritch and had an opportunity to examine ornithological books and began to work in earnest on his monograph, purchasing specimens of kingfishers from a meagre income. At nineteen, in 1867, he became a librarian at the Zoological Society of London on the recommendation of Osbert Salvin and Philip Sclater and he completed his Monograph of the Kingfishers (1868‚Äì71) during this period. The book was produced in parts with 121 illustrations. He then began to collaborate with Henry Dresser on A History of the Birds of Europe but this had to be abandoned because of his new appointment. On the death of George Robert Gray in 1872 he joined the British Museum as a Senior Assistant in the Department of Zoology, taking charge of the bird collection. On 3 December 1867 he married Emily Eliza, daughter of J. W. Burrows of Cookham. He named a species of kingfisher (Tanysiptera emiliae) after his wife in 1871. They had ten daughters and many of them contributed to his books (and of other authors too) by hand colouring the lithograph plates. One daughter, Emily Mary, worked in the entomology department of the Natural History Museum between 1905 and 1925. He became Assistant Keeper in 1895, a position he held until his death from pneumonia in 1909. He died at his home in Chiswick. In 1911 a ¬£100 civil pension was granted to his wife and daughters Emily Mary, Ada Lavinia and Eva Augusta. ==Contributions to ornithology== Sharpe's zoogeographical map As curator of the bird collections, Sharpe's main work was in classifying and cataloguing the collections. He also played a major role in acquiring private collections by persuading wealthy collectors and travellers to contribute to the museum. In 1872 the museum had 35,000 bird specimens; the collection had grown to half a million specimens by the time of his death. These included the bequests of Allan Octavian Hume, Osbert Salvin and Frederick DuCane Godman, the industrialist and amateur ornithologist Henry Seebohm, Colonel John Biddulph, C. B. Rickett, F. W. Styan, Alfred Russel Wallace, George Ernest Shelley, Philip Sclater and the bird illustrator John Gould. Sharpe founded the British Ornithologists' Club in 1892 and edited its bulletin. He wrote thirteen and a half of the 27 volumes of the Catalogue of the Birds in the British Museum (1874‚Äì1898). His handsome Birds of Paradise, published in two large volumes (over 21 inches x 14 inches) in 1891 and 1898, presented these colourful birds to the world: as Sharpe wrote in his preface, \\"a great number of the species are here figured for the first time\\". Sharpe was nominated at the International Ornithological Congress at Paris in 1900 to preside over the London Congress in 1905. ==Personality== Sharpe was noted as a genial and humorous person. Richard Meinertzhagen and his brother were introduced to the bird collections by him. He was fond of children, having ten daughters himself. None of them were given the name \\"Bowdler\\" at birth, but all adopted it later in life. The eldest daughter, Emily Mary Bowdler Sharpe, was a biologist and author in her own right, and also worked at the British Museum. The other nine daughters (Ada Lavinia, Eva Augusta, Lilian Bertha, Dora Louise, Lena Violet, Daisy Madeline, Sylvia Rosamund, Hilda Marion, and Aimee Marjorie) all worked as colourists on his works. Sharpe was also known for his practical jokes and pranks. When Eugene Oates was working on the Fauna of British India, he found the notes lying on a table and filled up a stray statement on the call of a white wagtail (ssp. lugens) which went into print (The note of this species is a prolonged \\"Pooh.\\"). On one occasion, Sharpe ascended the Eiffel tower with friends but became hysterical on reaching the top, with Ernst Hartert and several others having to restrain him and prevent him from jumping off. A regular at the Savage and Whitefriars Club, he and his wife threw a party in February 1888 with 120 guests and entertainment that included humorous sketches, songs, recitals and music. == Honours == Alexander Francis) and C. Lydon Sharpe was awarded an honorary LL.D. by the University of Aberdeen. He was fellow of the Linnean Society and the Zoological Society of London. A gold medal was awarded to him in 1891 by the Emperor of Austria. As of 2019, in the online list of world birds maintained by Frank Gill and David Donsker on behalf of the International Ornithological Committee, Sharpe is credited with formally describing and coining the Latin names of 233 species of bird as well as 201 subspecies. He is also credited with introducing 45 genera. Many species and subspecies of birds have been named after him including: * Sharpe's drongo (Dicrurus sharpei) * Sharpe's apalis (Apalis sharpii) * Sharpe's starling (Poeoptera sharpii) * Sharpe's akalat (Sheppardia sharpei) * Sharpe's longclaw (Macronyx sharpei) A genus Sharpia was erected but is now considered to be synonymous with Ploceus. == Publications == * * * (Vol. 1, Vol. 2) * * (Vol. 1, Vol. 2) * * (Vol. 1, Vol. 2, Vol. 3, Vol. 4) * * * (Vol. 1, Vol. 2, Vol. 3, Vol. 4, Vol. 5) === British Museum catalogues === Books of birds by Bowdler Sharpe: Male birds-of-paradise like Paradisaea decora compete for mates with elaborate patterns and displays developed by sexual selection. * Catalogue of the Accipitres, or diurnal birds of prey, in the collection of the British Museum.

National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Retrieved January 6, 2009. It occurs most frequently when a predisposed individual is exposed to cold and humidity. Ulcerated chilblains are referred to as kibes. Temperature-related chilblains can be prevented by keeping the feet and hands warm in cold weather and avoiding exposing these areas to extreme temperature changes. Chilblains can be idiopathic (spontaneous and unrelated to another disease), but similar symptoms may also be a manifestation of another serious medical condition that must be investigated. Related medical conditions include Raynaud's disease, erythromelalgia, frostbite, and trench foot, as well as connective tissue diseases such as lupus or vasculitis. In infants affected by Aicardi‚ÄìGouti√®res syndrome (a rare inherited condition which affects the nervous system) chilblain-like symptoms occur together with severe neurologic disturbances and unexplained fevers. Chilblain-like symptoms have also been linked to COVID-19. COVID toes, as they are commonly known, have mostly been reported in older children and adolescents, who often have not had other symptoms of COVID-19. The symptoms are usually mild and disappear without treatment. Their cause is debated: it is uncertain whether COVID toes are a delayed consequence of the viral infection itself (or at least partially connected to environmental factors during the COVID-19 pandemic).Unusual coronavirus (COVID-19) symptoms: What are they? They may share some of the microscopic features of chilblains caused by lupus. It has been suggested that in the absence of exposure to cold and damp, COVID-19 should be considered as a possible cause of chilblains. == Signs and symptoms == Chilblains from excessively icing the feet The areas most affected are the toes, fingers, earlobes, nose. * Blistering of affected area * Burning and itching sensation in extremities * Dermatitis in extremities * Ulceration (severe cases only) * Erythema (blanchable redness of the skin) * Pain in affected area * Skin discoloration, red to dark blue Chilblains caused by exposure to low temperatures usually heal within 7‚Äì14 days. == Prevention  Exposure === * Keep affected area warm, and avoid any extreme temperature changes (including very hot water). * Keep affected area dry. * Wear warm shoes, socks and gloves. * Wear a hat and a scarf to protect the ears and the nose. * Avoid tight fitting socks/shoes. === Other === * Exercise at least four times a week to improve circulation. * Quit smoking, as it damages circulation. == Treatment == Treatment for the condition depends on its cause. Below are some common treatments for chilblains caused by exposure to low temperatures, though some may also apply to other sources of the condition. * A course of vitamin B, especially nicotinic acid, may improve circulation. * Soaking in warm water with Epsom salts for 15‚Äì20 minutes, 3‚Äì4 times a day. * A topical steroid cream may relieve itching. * Nifedipine, a vasodilator, may help in some cases. Vasodilation may reduce pain, facilitate healing, and prevent recurrences. It is typically available in an oral pill but can be compounded into a topical formula. * Diltiazem, a vasodilator, may help. * Apply a mixture of friar's balsam and a weak iodine solution. * Avoid restricting the affected area. ==History== The medieval Bald's Leechbook recommended treating chilblains with a mix of eggs, wine, and fennel root,Robert Lacey and Danny Danziger August: The Year 1000: What Life Was Like at the Turn of the First Millennium Little, Brown, 2000 and a modern home remedy is to put garlic on the chilblains.

His father had been intendant successively to the duc de Penthi√®vre, the comte de Toulouse and the unfortunate princesse de Lamballe, who was the boy's godmother. Lemercier was a prodigy; before he was sixteen his tragedy of M√©l√©agre was produced at the Th√©√¢tre Fran√ßais. Clarisse Harlowe (1792) provoked the criticism that the author was \\"pas assez rou√© pour peindre les roueries\\" (not enough scamp to depict scamp tricks.) Le Tartufe r√©volutionnaire a parody full of bold political allusions, was suppressed after the fifth performance. In 1795, Lemercier's masterpiece Agamemnon, called by Charles Lafitte the last great antique tragedy in French literature, was produced. It was a great success, but was violently attacked later by Julien Louis Geoffroy who stigmatized it as a bad caricature of Prosper Jolyot de Cr√©billon. Les quatre m√©tamorphoses (1799) was written to prove that the most indecent subjects might be treated without offence. The Pinto (1800) was the result of a wager that no further dramatic innovations were possible after the comedies of Pierre Beaumarchais. It is a historical comedy on the subject of the Portuguese Revolution of 1640. This play was construed as casting reflections on the first consul Napoleon, who had hitherto been a firm friend of the avowed republican Lemercier. His extreme freedom of speech finally offended Napoleon, and the quarrel proved disastrous to Lemercier's fortune for the time. In 1803, he earned a severe disappointment on the premi√®re of his tragedy Isule et Orov√®se which was widely ridiculed and hooted by the public; consequently, at the beginning of the third act Lemercier withdrew his manuscript. He published his text with annoted ‚Äúhootings‚Äù in order to pay deference to his public.Original edition of Isule et Orov√®se (1803) None of his subsequent work fulfilled the expectations raised by Agamemnon, with the exception perhaps of Fr√©d√©gonde et Brunehaut (1821). In 1810, he was elected to the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise, where he consistently opposed the romanticists, refusing to vote for Victor Hugo ‚Äì who was to succeed him in the fauteuil 14.Site of the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise In spite of this, he has some pretensions to be considered the earliest of the romantic school. His Christophe Colomb (1809), advertised on the play-bill as a com√©die shakesp√©rienne [sic], represented the interior of a ship, and showed no respect for the classical unities. Its numerous innovations provoked such violent disturbances in the audience that one person was killed and future representations had to be guarded by the police. Lemercier wrote four long and ambitious epic poems: Hom√®re, Alexandre (1801), L'Atlantiade ou la th√©ogonie newtonienne (1812) and Mo√Øse (1823), as well as an extraordinary Panhypocrisiade (1819-1832), a distinctly romantic production in sixteen cantos, which has the sub-title Spectacle infernal du XVIe si√®cle. In it 16th century history, with Charles V and Francis I as principal personages, is played out on an imaginary stage by demons in the intervals of their sufferings. Lemercier died on 7 June 1840 in Paris. He had composed his own epitaph as follows: ¬´ Il fut homme de bien et cultiva les lettres. ¬ª (‚ÄúHe was a gentleman and a man of letters.‚Äù) == Works  Theatre === *1788: M√©l√©agre, tragedy in 5 acts *1792: Clarisse Harlowe, drama, in verse *1795: Le Tartufe r√©volutionnaire, comedy in 5 acts, in verse *1796: Le L√©vite d'√âphra√Øm, tragedy in 3 acts *1797: Agamemnon, tragedy in 5 acts, presented at the Th√©√¢tre de la R√©publique 5 flor√©al an V (24 April) *1797: La Prude, comedy *1798: Ophis, tragedy in 5 acts, presented at the Th√©√¢tre de la R√©publique 2 niv√¥se an VII *1800: Pinto, ou la Journ√©e d'une conspiration, historical comedy, created at the Th√©√¢tre de la R√©publique 1 germinal an VIII (22 March) *1803: Isule et Orov√®se, tragedy in 5 acts *1808: Baudouin, empereur, tragedy in 3 acts *1808: Plaute ou la Com√©die latine, comedy in 3 acts, in verse, presented at the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise, 20 January *1809: Christophe Colomb, historical comedy in 3 acts, in verse, presented at the Th√©√¢tre de S.

It is generally uptempo music intended for nightclubs with the intention of being danceable but also suitable for contemporary hit radio. Developing from a combination of dance and pop with influences of disco, post-discoSmay, David & Cooper, Kim (2001). Bubblegum Music Is the Naked Truth: The Dark History of Prepubescent Pop, from the Banana Splits to Britney Spears: \\"... think about Stock-Aitken-Waterman and Kylie Minogue.

The genre, on the whole, tends to be producer- driven, despite some notable exceptions. Dance-pop is known for being highly eclectic, having borrowed influences from other genres, which varied by producers, artists and periods. Such include contemporary R&B;, house, trance, techno, electropop, new jack swing, funk and pop rock. Dance-pop is a popular mainstream style of music and there have been numerous pop artists and groups who perform in the genre. Notable ones include Cher, Madonna, Britney Spears, Kylie Minogue, Christina Aguilera, Spice Girls, Paula Abdul, Backstreet Boys, Michael Jackson, NSYNC, Jennifer Lopez, Janet Jackson, Rihanna, Taylor Swift, Selena Gomez, Katy Perry, Lady Gaga, and Ariana Grande. ==History1980s=== As the term \\"disco\\" started to go out of fashion by the late 1970s to early 1980s, other terms were commonly used to describe disco-based music, such as \\"post-disco\\", \\"club\\", \\"dance\\" or \\"dance-pop\\" music. These genres were, in essence, a more modern variant of disco music known as post-disco, which tended to be more experimental, electronic and producer/DJ-driven, often using sequencers and synthesizers. Dance-pop music emerged in the 1980s as a combination of dance and pop, or post-disco, which was uptempo and simple, club-natured, producer-driven and catchy. Dance-pop was more uptempo and dancey than regular pop, yet more structured and less free-form than dance music, usually combining pop's easy structure and catchy tunes with dance's strong beat and uptempo nature. Dance-pop music was usually created, composed and produced by record producers who would then hire singers to perform the songs. In the beginning of the 1980s, disco was an anathema to the mainstream pop. According to prominent Allmusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Madonna had a huge role in popularizing dance music as mainstream music, utilizing her charisma, chutzpah and sex appeal. Erlewine claimed that Madonna \\"launched dance-pop\\" and set the standard for the genre for the next two decades.Erlewine, Stephen Thomas. Madonna (Madonna album) at AllMusic. Retrieved September 4, 2009. As the primary songwriter on her self-titled debut album and a co-producer by her third record, Madonna's insistence on being involved in all creative aspects of her work was highly unusual for a female dance-pop vocalist at the time. The staff of Vice magazine stated that her debut album \\"drew the blueprint for future dance-pop.\\"\\"The 99 Greatest Dance Albums of All Time\\". Vice. July 14, 2015. Retrieved May 19, 2016. In the 1980s, dance-pop was closely aligned to other uptempo electronic genres, such as Hi-NRG. Prominent producers in the 1980s included Stock, Aitken and Waterman, who created Hi-NRG/dance-pop for artists such as Kylie Minogue, Dead or Alive and Bananarama. During the decade, dance-pop borrowed influences from funk (e.g. Michael Jackson and Whitney Houston), new jack swing (e.g. Janet Jackson and Paula Abdul), and contemporary R&B.; Other prominent dance-pop artists and groups of the 1980s included the Pet Shop Boys, Mel and Kim, Samantha Fox, Debbie Gibson, and Tiffany. ===1990s=== By the 1990s, dance-pop had become a major genre in popular music. Several dance-pop groups and artists emerged during the 1990s, such as the Spice Girls, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Jessica Simpson, Backstreet Boys, and 'NSYNC. During the early 1990s, dance-pop borrowed influences from house music (e.g. Right Said Fred's \\"I'm Too Sexy\\", Taylor Dayne's Soul Dancing, and Madonna's \\"Vogue\\", \\"Rescue Me\\" and \\"Deeper and Deeper\\"), as well as contemporary R&B; and new jack swing (e.g. Shanice's \\"I Love Your Smile\\"). By the late 1990s, electronic influences became evident in dance-pop music; Madonna's critically acclaimed and commercially successful album Ray of Light (1998) incorporated techno, trance and other forms of electronic dance music, bringing electronica into mainstream dance-pop. Additionally, also in 1998, Cher released a dance-pop song called \\"Believe\\" which made usage of a technological innovation of the time, Auto-Tune. An audio processor and a form of pitch modification software, Auto-Tune is commonly used as a way to correct pitch and to create special effects. Since the late 1990s, the use of Auto-Tune processing has become a common feature of dance-pop music. Celine Dion also released a midtempo dance- pop song, \\"That's the Way It Is\\" by the end of 1999. Also during this period, some British bands connected with Britpop and alternative pop experimented with dance pop as a form - examples include Catatonia single Karaoke Queen, Kenickie's final single Stay in the Sun and Romo band Orlando's major label debut single \\"Just For A Second.\\" Another Britpop band, Theaudience was fronted by Sophie Ellis Bextor who went on to a successful solo career primarily in artist-driven dance-pop. ===2000s=== Kylie Minogue, a popular and successful dance-pop musician from the late-1980s until the early-2010s At the beginning of the 2000s, dance-pop music was still prominent, and highly electronic in style, influenced by genres such as trance, house, techno and electro. Nonetheless, as R&B; and hip hop became extremely popular from the early part of the decade onwards, dance-pop was often influenced by urban music. Dance-pop stars from the 1980s and 1990s such as Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Madonna, Janet Jackson and Kylie Minogue continued to achieve success at the beginning of the decade. Whilst much dance-pop at the time was R&B-influenced;, many records started to return to their disco roots; Kylie Minogue's albums such as Light Years (2000) and Fever (2001) contained influences of disco music, or a new 21st-century version of the genre known as nu-disco; hit singles such as \\"Spinning Around\\" (2000) and \\"Can't Get You Out of My Head\\" (2001) also contained disco traces. In Madonna's case, her album Music (2000) contained elements of Euro disco, especially the successful eponymous lead single. Nevertheless, it was not until the mid-to-latter part of the decade when dance-pop music returned greatly to its disco roots; this can be seen with Madonna's album Confessions on a Dance Floor (2005), which borrowed strong influences from the genre, especially from 1970s artists and bands such as ABBA, Giorgio Moroder, the Bee Gees and Donna Summer. Britney Spears' album Blackout (2007) contained influences of Euro disco. Britney Spears is among the main faces of 2000s and 2010s dance-pop music. The mid-to- late 2000s saw the arrival of several new dance-pop artists, including Rihanna, Kesha, Katy Perry and Lady Gaga. This period in time also saw dance- pop's return to its more electronic roots aside from its disco ones, with strong influences of synthpop and electropop. Lady Gaga is frequently considered as one of the pioneers of this evolution, notably with her singles \\"Just Dance\\" and \\"Poker Face\\" which were heavily influenced by synthpop and electropop. Rihanna's singles in the dance-pop genre, including \\"Don't Stop the Music\\" and \\"Disturbia\\", contained electronic influences, the former of which has elements of house music, the latter electropop. Kesha's debut single, \\"Tik Tok\\", was also highly electronic in style and employed a video game beat. Katy Perry's \\"Hot N Cold\\" (2008), \\"California Gurls\\" (2010), and \\"Firework\\" (2010), which were major commercial hits, also showcased influences of electropop and house music. ===2010s=== The 2010s, similarly to the late 2000s, saw strong electronic influences present within dance-pop and also strong emphasis on bass-heavy drum beats. Artists such as Britney Spears, Lady Gaga, Taylor Swift, Katy Perry, Madonna, Kesha, Christina Aguilera, Usher and Rihanna remained very popular, while newer recording artists such as Ariana Grande, Justin Bieber, Rita Ora, and Dua Lipa joined the dance-pop charts within the decade.https://www.billboard.com/charts/year-end/2019/dance-club- songs American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift's albums Red (2012), 1989 (2014) and Reputation (2017) contain more of a pop-influenced sound, which features production by dance-pop record producers Max Martin and Shellback. Ariana Grande's single \\"Problem\\" featuring Iggy Azalea was a big hit in 2014 and reached combined sales and track-equivalent streams of 9 million units worldwide the following year. ==Characteristics== Dance-pop generally contains several notable characteristics, which are listed here: *Uptempo, upbeat music intended for clubs, with a danceable or dance-centered character. *Catchy songs with an easy, pop-based structure. *A strong emphasis on beats, grooves and rhythms. *Prominent hooks. *Simple lyrics. *Polished productions. ==See also== * Dance-pop artists ==References== Category:20th-century dance Category:21st-century dance Category:1980s in music Category:1990s in music Category:2000s in music Category:2010s in music Category:Dance in the United States Category:Dance music genres Category:Pop music genres Category:Electronic dance music genres Category:Fusion music genres Category:Popular music ","title":"Dance-pop"},{"id":"526091","text":"The Churchill Rocket Research Range is a former rocket launch site located outside Churchill, Manitoba. The facility was used by Canada and the United States beginning in 1954 for sub-orbital launches of sounding rockets to study the upper atmosphere. The site was scientifically beneficial due to lying in the center of a zone containing high aurora activity. Over 3,500 sub-orbital flights were launched from the site.CSA - Fort Churchill ‚Äì a landmark in Canadian space research The site is sometimes referred to as Fort Churchill after the nearby former military base (now Churchill Airport) and is connected by an all-weather gravel road to the town of Churchill. ==History== A rocket launching at the Churchill Rocket Research Range, 1965 The complex was first built in 1954 by the Canadian Army's Defence Research Board to study the effects of auroras on long distance communications. The programme shut down in 1955, but the site was re-opened and greatly expanded in 1956 as part of Canada's participation in the International Geophysical Year. Launches for the IGY experiments started in 1957, and the site was closed again in December 1958 when the IGY, which was actually two years long, ended. The site was reopened again in August 1959 by the US Army, in collaboration with the Canadian government, as part of its network of sounding rocket stations. In September 1959 it was used to test CARDE's new solid fuel propellant systems with PVT-1, the vehicle that would evolve into the Black Brant. However, in late 1960 a fire destroyed many of the facilities. It was announced that the Black Brant test series would be continued with an additional twelve launches at NASA's Wallops Flight Facility during 1961-62, while the facilities at Churchill were rebuilt. The US Army ended its involvement at Churchill in June 1970, and the site was taken over by the Canadian National Research Council to support the Canadian Upper Atmosphere Research Program. The site was used sporadically during the 1970s and 1980s, and was largely deserted by 1985. === SpacePort Canada: 1994-1998 === Akjuit Aerospace, a Canadian company founded in 1992, signed a 30-year lease with the Canadian government for the Churchill Rocket Research Range in 1994 with the goal of developing the world's first commercial spaceport. Akjuit assembled a \\"technical team\\" of 21 firms led by the American aerospace contractor Raytheon to plan the development of the site into SpacePort Canada, including polar orbital launch capability. Akjuit planned to launch commercial polar-orbiting payloads using Russian-made Start-1 rockets (so named as they were made of repurposed Soviet-era SS-25 ICBMs made redundant by the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty). Churchill's location in the western hemisphere combined with its range-safety for firing northwards made it an ideal location, with the exception of the extremely cold weather which would limit launch seasons. Akjuit's first and only rocket launch took place at 7:10a.m. Central Time on April 28, 1998: a suborbital Black Brant IXB research rocket containing a physics payload for the Canadian Space Agency. Akjuit Aerospace ceased operations in May 1998. ==Current uses== The Churchill Northern Studies Centre constructed on part of the rocket range property.

She won the platform-diving world championship in 1991 at the age of 12, making her the youngest diving champ of all time. She is also famous for being one of the youngest Olympic diving champions, having earned a gold at the 1992 Barcelona Games when she was just 13 years and 345 days old. Throughout the 1990s, Fu dominated the sport with her repertoire of extremely difficult dives. During the 2000 Sydney Olympics, Fu won her fourth gold medal, joining Americans Pat McCormick and Greg Louganis as the world's only quadruple Olympic-diving champions. ==Early life and career== Fu Mingxia was born into a working-class family in the city of Wuhan, located along the Yangtze River in central China. Inspired by an older sister, Fu enrolled in gymnastics at a local sports school at the age of 5. Though she was just a child, Fu demonstrated remarkable poise and body control. The coaches, however, felt that she was not flexible enough to make it as a gymnast. Instead, they suggested she pursue diving, though Fu, only about seven years old at the time, could not swim. Fu made the transition from gymnast to springboard diver and before long was noticed by diving coach Yu Fen, who took Fu to Beijing in 1989 to train at a state-sponsored boarding school as a member of the state diving team. Because of her remarkable talents, she became a part of China's disciplined, but highly successful sports machine. Through a strenuous training program, Fu learned to set aside her fears and progressed quickly. Training sessions averaged four to five hours a day, seven days a week, with the occasional nine-hour day. At times, Fu practiced 100 dives a day. In time, she was gliding so close to the platform during her dives that her short hair often touched the end during her descent toward the water. In 1990, Fu made her international diving debut, capturing a gold at the U.S. Open and also at the Goodwill Games, held that summer in Seattle. Her daring dives from the top of the 10-meter platform transformed the teeny 12-year-old into a national treasure. However, with pressure mounting, Fu placed third at the Asian Games held in Beijing in the fall of 1990. Following the loss, she changed her routine, adding moves that were technically more difficult, but which she felt more comfortable performing. By 1991, Fu was talented enough to attend the diving world championships, held in Perth, Australia. The competition was intense, and Fu found herself in eighth place in the final round because she had failed a compulsory dive. Fu pulled herself together, however, and ended up with the title, beating out the Soviet Union's World Cup winner Yelena Miroshina by nearly 25 points. At just 12 years old, Fu became the youngest international champion ever. It is a title she will hold forever because after the competition, swimming's national governing body changed the rules, requiring all competitors of international competitions to be at least 14 years old. While Fu initially made her mark on the 10-meter platform, she also began competing on the three-meter springboard. In April 1992, she won the gold on the springboard at the Chinese international diving tournament in Shanghai. Fu made her Olympic debut at the 1992 Games, held in Barcelona, Spain. During the competition, the 154cm (5'1/2\\"), 43kg (94.8lb) Fu used her youthful fearlessness to beat out older, more elegant competitors. Fu captured a gold in the platform competition. At 13, she was the youngest medal winner at the Olympics that year-and the second-youngest in the history of the Games. She also qualified as the youngest Olympic diving champion, a title she still holds. Fu's success in her first Olympics drove her toward her second. In preparing for the 1996 Olympics, held in Atlanta, Fu trained seven hours a day, six days a week. Her only other activities included listening to music, watching television and getting massages. Fu's coaches drilled her hard, but she said she found comfort and peace from the physically and mentally straining regimen through music. Fu was in top form at the 1996 Olympics and shone on both the platform and springboard, taking gold in both events. She was the first woman in 36 years to win both events in a single Olympics. == Awards and accomplishments == *1990 Goodwill Games ‚Äì 10m platform 1st (11 years old) *1991 Asian Games ‚Äì 10m platform 3rd (12 years old) *1991 World Swimming Championships ‚Äì 10m platform 1st (12 years old) *1992 Olympic Games ‚Äì 10m platform 1st (13 years old) *1993 FINA Diving World Cup ‚Äì 3m springboard 3rd (15 years old) *1994 World Swimming Championships ‚Äì 10m platform 1st (16 years old) *1994 Asian Games ‚Äì 3m springboard 2nd (16 years old) *1995 FINA Diving World Cup ‚Äì 10m platform 2nd (17 years old) *1995 FINA Diving World Cup ‚Äì 3m springboard 1st (17 years old) *1996 Olympic Games ‚Äì 10m platform 1st (18 years old) *1996 Olympic Games ‚Äì 3m springboard 1st (18 years old) *1999 University Games ‚Äì 10m platform 1st (21 years old) *1999 University Games ‚Äì 3m springboard 1st (21 years old) *2000 FINA Diving World Cup ‚Äì 3m springboard 2nd (22 years old) *2000 Olympic Games ‚Äì 3m springboard synchronized (with Guo Jingjing) 2nd (22 years old) *2000 Olympic Games ‚Äì 3m springboard 1st (22 years old) == Retirement and comeback == Shortly after Atlanta, the triple- gold-medallist decided to retire and enrolled at Beijing's Tsinghua University to study management science. Fu also got involved in politics and in 1997 served as a delegate to the Communist Party's 15th Congress. Fu spent about two years off the board. By 1998, however, Fu began diving with the university team, but on her own terms. On her own terms still meant a disciplined training schedule, but she reduced the number of hours per day down to five. Fu found that practicing just for the sake of practicing to be a pointless endeavor. As a member of the university team, Fu competed in the 1999 Universiade in Palma, Spain, winning both the highboard and springboard titles. Less than a year back into it, she won silver at the Diving World Cup. Fu regained her spot on the national Olympic squad and also took up a new sport - three-meter synchronized diving - as she headed for the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia. Fu and her partner, Guo Jingjing, practiced together for less than six months, yet earned a silver. The Russian pair that beat them had trained together for years. After the synchronized diving event, Fu went on to compete on the springboard. She won a gold, nailing her final dive, a reverse one-and-a-half somersault, two-and-a-half twist for nines when eights would have been enough to beat out Guo, her teammate. With her four gold medals and one silver, Fu became one of the most decorated Olympic divers of all time. She is one of only three divers to win an Olympic double-double in the individual events: Pat McCormick and Greg Louganis being the other two. == Marriage and motherhood == Fu married Antony Leung, former Financial Secretary of Hong Kong, on July 15, 2002 in Hawaii. Their marriage was not publicly revealed until July 30, 2002. They have a daughter (born February 26, 2003) and two sons (born December 12, 2004 and April 25, 2008). Though Fu is no longer diving, she was a member of the Beijing Olympic bid committee for the 2008 Olympics. Beijing won the bid, and Fu was to serve as an ambassador at the event. ==See also== * List of members of the International Swimming Hall of Fame * List of divers ==References== * New York Times, May 4, 1992. * South China Morning Post, March 6, 1993; March 24, 2002. * Straits Times (Singapore), February 28, 2003. * Washington Post, May 22, 1991.

A student who successfully completes all courses required for the major qualifies for an undergraduate degree. The word major is also sometimes used administratively to refer to the academic discipline pursued by a graduate student or postgraduate student in a master's or doctoral program. An academic major typically requires completion of a combination of prescribed and elective courses in the chosen discipline. In addition, most colleges and universities require that all students take a general core curriculum in the liberal arts. The latitude a student has in choosing courses varies from program to program. An academic major is administered by select faculty in an academic department. A major administered by more than one academic department is called an interdisciplinary major. In some settings, students may be permitted to design their own major, subject to faculty approval. In the US, students are usually not required to choose their major discipline when first enrolling as an undergraduate. Normally students are required to commit by the end of their second academic year at latest, and some schools even disallow students from declaring a major until this time. A student who declares two academic majors is said to have a double major. A coordinate major is an ancillary major designed to complement the primary one. A coordinate major requires fewer course credits to complete. Many colleges also allow students to declare a minor field, a secondary discipline in which they also take a substantial number of classes, but not so many as would be necessary to complete a major. ==History== The roots of the academic major as we now know it first surfaced in the 19th century as \\"alternative components of the undergraduate degree\\".\\"The Academic Major.\\" Encyclopedia of Education. Ed. Guthrie, James W. 2nd ed. Vol. 1. New York: Macmillan Reference USA, 2006. 19-23. Before that, all students receiving an undergraduate degree would be required to study the same slate of courses geared at a comprehensive \\"liberal education\\". In 1825, the University of Virginia initiated an educational approach that would allow students to choose, from eight options, an area of focus (ex: ancient languages, anatomy, medicine) and higher educational systems in Europe after the American civil war developed further into a stricter specialization approach to studies. In the United States, in the second half of the 19th century, concentrated foci at the undergraduate level began to prosper and popularize, but the familiar term \\"major\\" did not appear until 1877 in a Johns Hopkins University catalogue. The major generally required 2 years of study. The minor, required one. From 1880 to 1910, Baccalaureate granting American institutions vastly embraced a free-elective system, where students were endowed with a greater freedom to explore intellectual curiosities. The 1930s witnessed the appearance of first interdisciplinary major: American studies. Culture was the grounding concept and orchestrating principle for its courses. 1960s to 1970s experienced a new tide of interdisciplinary majors and a relaxation of curriculum and graduation requirements. (Civil Rights Movement spawned Women‚Äôs studies and Black Studies, for example.) Conrad, Clifton F. The Undergraduate Curriculum: A guide to Innovation and Reform. Boulder, CO: Westview Press (1978) In the 1980s and 1990s, \\"interdisciplinary studies, multiculturalism, feminist pedagogy, and a renewed concern for the coherence and direction of the undergraduate program began to assail the Baccalaureate degree dominated by the academic major.\\" ==Major's significance== The academic major is considered a defining and dominant characteristic of the undergraduate degree. \\"The ascendancy of the disciplines in the late nineteenth century and their continuing dominance throughout the twentieth century have left an indelible imprint on the shape and direction of the academic major\\" and research affirms that the academic major is the strongest and clearest curricular link to gains in student learning. While general education is considered to be the breadth component of an undergraduate education, the major is commonly deemed as the depth aspect. Choice of major has a significant impact on employment prospects and lifetime earnings.Career Earnings by College Major - interactive chart from The Hamilton Project (US)The Economic Value of College Majors - interactive chart from Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce (US) ==Discourse and disagreement== Through its development, scholars, academics, and educators have disagreed on the purpose and nature of the undergraduate major. Generally, proponents of the major and departmental system \\"argue that they enable an academic community to foster the development, conservation and diffusion of knowledge.\\" In contrast, critics \\"claim that they promote intellectual tribalism, where specialization receives favor over the mastery of multiple epistemologies, where broader values of liberal learning and of campus unity are lost, and where innovation is inhibited due to parochial opposition to new sub-specialties and research methods.\\" ==Difference from academic concentration== In many universities, an academic concentration is a focus within a specific academic major, that is a field of study within a specific academic major. For example, interdisciplinary programs in humanities or social sciences will require a student to pick a specific academic concentration as a focus within their academic major, such as an academic major in Interdisciplinary Humanities with an academic concentration in Film or an academic major in Interdisciplinary Social Sciences with an academic concentration in Geography. At several art schools and liberal arts colleges, an academic concentration serves a similar function to an academic minor at other universities, that is an academic discipline outside of the student's academic major in which they take a number of classes. At Brown University and Harvard University, however, the term \\"concentration\\" refers simply to the major field. At the doctoral studies level, an academic major or major field refers to a student's primary focus within their degree program while a minor or minor field refers to his or her secondary focus. For example, a doctoral student studying History might pursue their degree in History with a major field in War and Society and a minor field in Postcolonial Studies. ==Impacted majors== An impacted major is a major for which more students apply for than the school can accommodate, a classic example of demand exceeding supply. When that occurs, the major becomes impacted and so is susceptible to higher standards of admission. For example, suppose that a school has minimum requirements are SATs of 1100 and a GPA of 3.0. If a person applies to an impacted major, the school can raise the minimum requirements as much as needed to weed out the students that it is unable to accommodate. Because of this, some students may opt to apply to a school as \\"Undeclared\\". If in the above example the school implements requirements of SATs of 1300 and a GPA of 3.4 for the impacted major, a student may find it better to apply as \\"Undeclared\\" if they meet only the minimum requirements. However, many universities, such as the University of California, Berkeley, may in turn present more difficult requirements (such as a GPA requirement in certain prerequisite classes) to enter an impacted major even once accepted to the university overall.https://eecs.berkeley.edu/resources/undergrads/cs/transfer-prereqs ==See also== ==References== ==Further reading== * * * ==External links== * Index of college majors at The Princeton Review * College major profile at The College Board Category:Higher education in Canada Category:Higher education in the United States Category:School terminology ","title":"Academic major"},{"id":"526106","text":"The European Patent Organisation (sometimes abbreviated EPOrg European Patent Office web site, European Patent Convention (EPC), Alphabetical keyword index.

Archibald was the eighth of ten children, son of Ferdinand Reiss, landowner and Pauline Sabine Anna Gabriele Seutter von Loetzen. After finishing highschool in Germany, he went to Switzerland for his studies. He had received a Ph.D. in chemistry at the age of 22 and was an expert in photography and forensic science. In 1906 he was appointed a professor of forensic science at the University of Lausanne. In 1909, he was the founder of the first academic forensic science programme and of the \\"Institut de police scientifique\\" (Institute of forensic science) at the University of Lausanne. He published two major books on forensic science \\"Photographie judiciaire\\" (Forensic photography), Mendel, Paris, in 1903 and the first part of his major contribution \\"Manuel de police scientifique. I Vols et homicides\\" (Handbook of forensic science I: Thefts and homicides), Payot, Lausanne and Acan, Paris, in 1911. The Institute he created celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2009 and has grown to become a major school, \\"Ecole des sciences criminelles\\", that includes forensic science, criminology and criminal law within the Faculty of Law and Criminal Justice of the University of Lausanne. ==Serbia== The urn containing the heart of Archibald Reiss, which was located on Kajmakƒçalan (2521m), where Serbians defeated the Bulgarian army and re-entered their own land in the First World War. The Bulgarians destroyed the urn in the Second World War With the advent of World War I, Reiss was commissioned by the Serbian government to investigate atrocities committed by the invading Central Powers against Serbs. Dr. Reiss would end up extensively documenting his findings in two reports. The first, \\"Report upon the atrocities committed by the Austro-Hungarian Army during the first invasion of Serbia\\" was completed in 1915 and published in 1916, focusing on the crimes committed by the Austro- Hungarians against the Serbs during their invasion and occupation of Serbia in the first few months of World War I in 1914. The second Reiss report focused on the second round of the invasion and occupation of Serbia and crimes committed against the Serbs which began in 1915, this time by the combined forces of Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, and Germany. This second report, \\"Infringement of the Rules and Laws of War committed by the Austro-Bulgaro- Germans: Letters of a Criminologist on the Serbian Macedonian Front\\", was published in 1919. When Serbia was overrun in 1915 he joined the Serbian Army in its retreat across Albania to return with the victorious Serbian Army when it liberated Belgrade in the final days of the war. He was known as a great friend of Serbia and the Serbian people and after the war decided to stay and live in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Upon the invitation of the Serbian Government, he carried out an inquiry on Hungarian, German and Bulgarian atrocities in Serbia during World War I and published the reports in European papers. He was part of the Serbian Government's envoy at the Paris Peace Conference, 1919. He found propaganda postcards of the Austrian-Hungarian Army showing atrocities against Serbian people. After the war, Reiss helped establish the first police academy in Serbia and teach forensic sciences. He was one of the founders of the Red Cross of Serbia. He became an honorary citizen of Krupanj in 1926. After his death, his body was buried in the Topƒçider cemetery and, at his own request, his heart was buried on Kajmakƒçalan hill. The urn containing his heart was later demolished as revenge by the Bulgarians in World War II. ==Legacy== As a legacy to the Serbian people, he left an unpublished manuscript Ecoutez les Serbes! (\\"Listen Serbs!\\", sr. ƒåujte Srbi!). It was finished on 1 June 1928, and in 2004 was printed in Serbia in a large number of copies and distributed for free. Several streets across Serbia, particularly in Vojvodina carry his name. There is a primary school in Karaburma, Belgrade named after him.

She is regarded as one of the greatest players in the history of the sport. == Career == Deng began playing table tennis at age of five, and four years later she won the provincial junior championship. She was age 13 when she won her first national championship. Despite her success, she was initially denied a spot on the national team because she was so short (she stood only 1.5 metres [4 feet 11 inches] tall). She was finally included on the national team in 1988. She teamed with Qiao Hong to win her first world championship title in the women's doubles competition in 1989. Two years later in 1991, Deng won her first singles world championship. At the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, Spain, she won a gold medal in both the singles and doubles competitions and repeated the feat at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, USA. She also earned singles and doubles titles at the 1995 and 1997 world championships. When she retired at the age of 24, she had won more titles than any other player in this sport, including four Olympic gold medals, and had been World Champion 18 times. From 1990 to 1997, she retained the title of world No. 1 ranked female table tennis player for 8 years. She was voted Chinese female athlete of the century, and joined the International Table Tennis Federation Hall of Fame in 2003. ===Successes=== *40th World Table Tennis Championship (1989) Women's Double Gold. *1st Table Tennis World Cup (1990) Women's Team Gold. *41st World Table Tennis Championship (1991) Women's Single Gold, Women's Team Silver, Women's Double Silver. *2nd Table Tennis World Cup (1991‚Äì1992) Women's Team Gold, Women's Double Gold. *25th Olympic Games (1992) Table Tennis Women's Single Gold, Women's Double Gold. *42nd World Table Tennis Championship (1993) Women's Team Gold, Women's Double Silver. *43rd World Table Tennis Championship (1995) Women's Team Gold, Women's Single Gold, Women's Double Gold, Mixed Double Silver. *4th Table Tennis World Cup (1995) Women's Team Gold *26th Olympic Games (1996) Table Tennis Women's Single Gold, Women's Double Gold. *5th Table Tennis World Cup (1996) Women's Single Gold *44th World Table Tennis Championship (1997) Women's Team Gold, Women's Single Gold, Women's Double Gold, Mixed Double Silver. ==Life after retirement== After retiring at the end of the 1997 season, Deng served on the International Olympic Committee's ethics and athletes commissions. She is also a member of the elite Laureus World Sports Academy, and a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. She gained a bachelor's degree from Tsinghua University, a master's degree from the University of Nottingham, and as of March 2006,youth , 8 March 2006 was continuing to study for a PhD. in Land Economy at the University of Cambridge (Jesus College). Her research work coincides with her professional focus on the marketing, management and development of the 2008 Beijing Olympics as a member of the Beijing Organizing Committee.

In the broadest sense, the chain forms the northern edge of the Tibetan Plateau south of the Tarim Basin. The exact definition of this range varies. An old source uses Kunlun to mean the mountain belt that runs across the center of China, that is, Kunlun in the narrow sense: Altyn Tagh along with the Qilian and Qin Mountains. A recent sourceNational Geographic Atlas of China, 2008 has the Kunlun range forming most of the south side of the Tarim Basin and then continuing east south of the Altyn Tagh. Sima Qian (Records of the Grand Historian, scroll 123) says that Emperor Wu of Han sent men to find the source of the Yellow River and gave the name Kunlun to the mountains at its source. The name seems to have originated as a semi- mythical location in the classical Chinese text Classic of Mountains and Seas. ==Extent== Kunlun range Tibet-Xinjiang highway From the Pamirs of Tajikistan, the Kunlun Mountains run east along the border between Xinjiang and Tibet autonomous regions to the Sino-Tibetan ranges in Qinghai province. They stretch along the southern edge of what is now called the Tarim Basin, the infamous Takla Makan desert, and the Gobi Desert. A number of important rivers flow from the range including the Karakash River ('Black Jade River') and the Yurungkash River ('White Jade River'), which flow through the Khotan Oasis into the Taklamakan Desert. The Kunlun Pass Altyn-Tagh or Altun Range is one of the chief northern ranges of the Kunlun. Its northeastern extension Qilian Shan is another main northern range of the Kunlun. In the south main extension is the Min Shan. Bayan Har Mountains, a southern branch of the Kunlun Mountains, forms the watershed between the catchment basins of China's two longest rivers, the Yangtze River and the Yellow River. The highest mountain of the Kunlun Shan is the Kunlun Goddess (7,167 m) in the Keriya area in western Kunlun Shan. Some authorities claim that the Kunlun extends further northwest-wards as far as Kongur Tagh (7,649 m) and the famous Muztagh Ata (7,546 m). But these mountains are physically much more closely linked to the Pamir group (ancient Mount Imeon). The Arka Tagh (Arch Mountain) is in the center of the Kunlun Shan; its highest points are Ulugh Muztagh (6,973 m) and Bukadaban Feng (6,860 m). In the eastern Kunlun Shan the highest peaks are Yuzhu Peak (6,224 m) and Amne Machin [also Dradullungshong] (6,282 m); the latter is the eastern major peak in Kunlun Shan range and is thus considered as the eastern edge of Kunlun Shan range. The mountain range formed at the northern edges of the Cimmerian Plate during its collision, in the Late Triassic, with Siberia, which resulted in the closing of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean. The range has very few roads and in its 3,000 km length is crossed by only two. In the west, Highway 219 traverses the range en route from Yecheng, Xinjiang to Lhatse, Tibet. Further east, Highway 109 crosses between Lhasa and Golmud. ===Kunlun Volcanic Group=== Over 70 volcanic cones form the Kunlun Volcanic Group. They are not volcanic mountains, but cones. As such, they are not counted among the world volcanic mountain peaks. The group, however, musters the heights of above sea level (). If they were considered volcanic mountains, they would constitute the highest volcano in Asia and China and second highest in the Eastern Hemisphere (after Mount Kilimanjaro) and one of Volcanic Seven Summits by elevation. (Mount Damavand is the highest volcano in Asia, not the Kunlun cones.) The last known eruption in the volcanic group was on May 27, 1951. ==Mythology== Peak in Kunlun range Kunlun is originally the name of a mythical mountain believed to be a Taoist paradise. The first to visit this paradise was, according to the legends, King Mu (976-922 BCE) of the Zhou Dynasty. He supposedly discovered there the Jade Palace of the Yellow Emperor, the mythical originator of Chinese culture, and met Hsi Wang Mu (Xi Wang Mu), the 'Spirit Mother of the West' usually called the 'Queen Mother of the West', who was the object of an ancient religious cult which reached its peak in the Han Dynasty, and also had her mythical abode in these mountains. ==In popular culture== The Kunlun mountains (spelled \\"Kuen-Lun\\" in the book) are described as the location of the Shangri-La monastery in the 1933 novel Lost Horizon by English writer James Hilton. The mountains are the site of the fictional city of K'un Lun in the Marvel Comics Iron Fist series and the TV show of the same name. The Kunlun mountain range serves as the setting for a mission in the 2013 video game Battlefield 4 in which a Chinese high-security prison is located within the mountains. The multiplayer map Operation Locker features the location as well. ==References== ==Further reading== *Munro-Hay, Stuart Aksum.

Various Nichiren-related sects based in Japan claim to have been founded by Nikko, including Nichiren Sh≈çsh≈´ and some lineages within Nichiren Shu. Various Nichiren Buddhist schools recognize that Nikk≈ç kept meticulous scholarly records during his lifetime, along with keeping a highly organized religious practice, and is responsible for much of the records that survive todayNews n¬∞153, Nichiren Shu.. Nikk≈ç singularly upheld the doctrine that Nichiren was the True and Eternal Buddha in the Latter Day of the Law (Mapp≈ç) and therefore is considered by schools stemming from Nikk≈ç such Nichiren Sh≈çsh≈´ and the Soka Gakkai, the sole legitimate successor to the ministry and legacy of Nichiren. Other schools reject the claim that he is the chosen disciple among the six senior disciples of Nichiren. Nikko established the Head Temple Taisekiji at Fujinomiya in 1290, as well as enshrining the Dai Gohonzon image. In 1332, four months before his death, he designated Nichimoku Shonin as his successor. The grave of Nikk≈ç remains today in Kitayama Honmonji, Omosu, in Suruga Province where he lived for thirty-six years, establishing a Buddhist seminary in the Nichiren-sh≈´ religion. The Koshi-E memorial feast of his death anniversary is commemorated on February 6 (Nichiren Shoshu O-tai-ya) and February 7 (Gosho-to-e ceremony). ==Early life== The Seppo Ishi, a boulder where Nikk≈ç is said to have once preached at the Taisekiji Temple Nikk≈ç was born at Kajikazawa in Koma District of Kai Province. His father, Oi-no Kitsuroku was from Totsumi province and later moved to Kai province while maintaining his samurai career. He died when Nikk≈ç was a child. Nikk≈ç's mother was Myofuku Tsunashima () and was from what is now Shizuoka Prefecture. He was raised by his grandfather, Nyudo Yui. As a child, he entered the Tendai temple Shijuku-in, in Fujiwakabacho, Iwabuchi. He took the acolyte name, \\"Hokibo\\" and received his education here, which as well as Tendai doctrine, included Chinese classics, Japanese literature, poetry, calligraphy, as well as other subjects. ==As Nichiren‚Äôs disciple== In 1257, Nichiren visited Jisso-ji Temple closely affiliated with Shijuku-in Temple where he studied various Buddhist sutras in its library for his treatise Rissh≈ç Ankoku Ron (Á´ãÊ≠£ÂÆâÂõΩË´ñ, \\"Establishing the Correct teaching for the Peace of the Land\\"). Nikk≈ç served Nichiren here, and vowed to become his disciple. In addition, Nikk≈ç also accompanied Nichiren on his two exiles. Nikk≈ç is also credited with preserving many of Nichiren's voluminous writings. He was particularly careful to ensure the survival of Nichiren's many letters written in simple characters (Kana) for uneducated followers. He was also instrumental in gaining Nichimoku to become a junior disciple of Nichiren, later appointing him as successor of the Buddhist treasures confiscated from Kuonji Temple, and the appointment as third High Priest of the Taisekiji temple. On 8 October 1282, Nikk≈ç became one of the six senior priests whom Nichiren designated to carry on his faith after his death. According to various Nichiren sects that claim Nikko as their founder, on October 13, 1282, Nichiren further designated Nikk≈ç the chief priest of Kuon- ji, the temple at Mt. Minobu in Yamanashi Prefecture, where Nichiren had spent the last years of his life as purportedly recorded in a transfer document called Minobu-zan Fuzoku-sho (\\"Document entrusting Mt. Minobu\\"); however, the authenticity of this document is disputed by some Nichiren sects. Later that same day, Nichiren died at Ikegami, now part of Tokyo. Following Nichiren's 100th day funeral ceremonies, Nikk≈ç left Ikegami on October 21 to carry Nichiren's ashes back to Mount Minobu, arriving on October 25. On the centenarian anniversary of Nichiren's death, Nikk≈ç, the other five senior priests, and their disciples conducted a 100th-day memorial service, after which the others departed for their own territories where they were most active. Nikk≈ç carried out his duties as chief priest of Kuon-ji, teaching disciples and looking after the laity. Central to his work was attending, cleaning and maintaining Nichiren's tomb, and collecting and cataloguing Nichiren's many writings for preservation and perpetuation. ==Isolation from other disciples== An image of Hagiri Sanenaga, patron of Shinto, enshrined at Minenyama Kuonji temple. The Stupa and grave of Nikko, located in Kitayama Honmonji of the Nichiren Shu sect, in Fujinomiya, Shizuoka Prefecture. Latter feelings of animosity and discord grew after the second death anniversary of Nichiren's 100th Day Memorial ceremony (23 January 1283) when, according to Nikko, the rotation system agreed in the \\"Shuso Gosenge Kiroku\\" (English: Record document of founder's demise) and Rembo Cho (English: Rotation Wheel System) to clean and maintain Nichiren's grave, was being abandoned by the other five senior disciples. By the third anniversary of Nichiren's death (13 October 1284), Nikk≈ç claimed that the other five senior priests no longer returned to Nichiren's tomb in Mount Minobu, citing the deer hoofs and other signs of neglect at the gravesite. In addition, Nikk≈ç accused that after Nichiren's death, the other disciples slowly began to deviate from Nichiren's teachings. Chief among these complaints was the syncretism by some of the disciples to worship images of both Shakyamuni Buddha while admonishing other disciple priests for signing their names \\"Tendai Shamon\\" of the Tendai Buddhist school in the subsequent documents notarized and sent to the Kamakura government. Furthermore, Nikko alleged that the other disciples became condescending towards some of Nichiren's writings because they were not written in Classical Chinese, but in the katakana syllabary, which was deemed inferior at the time. The steward of the temple district, Hagiri Sanenaga, who had been converted by Nikk≈ç, also began to commit unorthodox practices which Nikk≈ç deemed to be heretical, such as the following: # The crafting of a standing statue of Shakyamuni Buddha as an object of worship. # The donation of noren shrine curtains and horses to the Mishima Taisha Shinto shrine, at the time an honorary shrine of the H≈çj≈ç-clan shogunate. # The procurement of bamboo lumber for the Shinto Gassan Shrine. # The attendance of a memorial service dedicated to the stupa of Amida Buddha along with giving monetary donations to its Nembutsu priests in Fukushi ward, Nanbu, Yamanashi Prefecture. The Kuon-Ji Temple of Mount Minobu, in Yamanashi Prefecture, where Nikk≈ç formerly administered as its chief priest. These controversial acts received tolerance from another senior disciple, Mimbu Nik≈ç (Ê∞ëÈÉ®Êó•Âêë, 1253‚Äì1314) to be acceptable due to having been done ordinarily with the knowledge of Nichiren while he was alive. Accordingly, Hagiri Sanenaga provided his own personal reason that it was customary for his political family to make homage to the Shinto shrine of the Kamakura Shogunate, as well as reasoning that he had provided monetary donations to other Buddhist sects even when Nichiren himself was alive. Such developments eventually led Nikk≈ç to conclude that Nichiren's enlightened entity no longer resided and continue at Mount Minobu. Furthermore, he felt that Kuon-ji was not the place for perpetuating Nichiren's teachings, causing him to pack up his belongings, and allegedly some relics belonging to Nichiren, to depart, never to return. Nikk≈ç left Mount Minobu with a group of select disciples in the spring of 1289. Nanjo Shichijo-jiro Tokimitsu, a lay believer residing near Mount Fuji offered them sanctuary to stay, later donating a tract of land for a new temple that became Taiseki-ji Temple. Taiseki-ji is today the head temple of the Nichiren Sh≈çsh≈´ school and, since its founding on 12 October 1290, has been a major center of the K≈çmon-ha (ËààÈñÄÊ¥æ, also called the ÂØåÂ£´Ê¥æ: Fuji-ha) branch of Nichiren Buddhism, as the schools stemming from Nikk≈ç were traditionally known. Upon nearing death on 10 November 1332, Nikk≈ç named his disciple Nichimoku (1260‚Äì1333) as his successor and passed onto him the Ozagawari Gohonzon, inscribed in 8 April 1308 for the memorial honor of the martyr ‚ÄúJinshiro‚Äù, approximately 14 years after the persecution of Hei No Saimon Yoritsuna. This mandala is now enshrined inside the Dai-Kyakuden, along with his Juzu beads made of Crystal and Shimamenu Onyx which are now preserved in the Gohozo building of Taisekiji. For the remaining 36 years of his life, Nikk≈ç then retired a few miles away to Omosu, Suruga Province where he founded a seminary and temple, Ikegami Honmon-ji belonging to Nichiren-sh≈´ sect, and concentrated on training disciples until his death in the second lunar month of 1333 at the age of 87. A grave claiming to house the ash remains of Nikk≈ç Sh≈çnin is located in Kitayama Honmonji Temple in Suruga Province. After his death within this same temple, a statue of the solar goddess Amaterasu Omi-Kami and the protector god Hachiman was enshrined, donated by some early Hokkek≈ç believers. Such sculptural images are considered only decorative in present teachings of the Nichiren Sh≈çsh≈´ school. ==Buddhist articles claimed to have been brought to Taisekiji Temple== According to the doctrinal beliefs of Nichiren Sh≈çsh≈´, Nikk≈ç Shonin left Mount Minobu with several articles pertaining to Nichiren, namely the following: * The Dai Gohonzon Mandala * Transfer inheritance documents of his legitimacy as chief priest of Kuon-ji and as successor * Several Gohonzon mandalas inscribed by Nichiren * Remaining partial bones (17 pieces) and cremated ashes of Nichiren * The Onikuge, a piece of tooth belonging to Nichiren * A dragon candlestick, koro incense burner and vase Nichiren used when summoning rain during times of drought for the peasant devotees. * The Namamiei statue (Mieido) and the Sacred Treasure (Hoando) statue of Nichiren Daish≈çnin == Claim to Nichiren's successorship== Some followers of the Nichiren schools stemming from Nikk≈ç, in particular the Nichiren Sh≈çsh≈´ sect, as well as the Soka Gakkai, view Nikk≈ç as the sole legitimate successor to Nichiren. They base this claim on a document dated the ninth lunar month of 1282 called the Nichiren ichigo guh≈ç fuzoku-sho (‚ÄúDocument Entrusting the Law that Nichiren Propagated throughout His Life‚Äù). In this document, Nichiren entrusts the \\"entirety of his lifetime of teaching\\" to Nikk≈ç and names him the \\"Great Master of propagation of the essential teaching\\". These documents contained in a treasure box are alleged to have been stolen by clan head Takeda Katsuyori on behalf of the Nishiyama Temple, a faction of Nichiren Shu during the 15th century via force. Other Nichiren lineages based on the other original five senior disciples vehemently reject this claim of successorship, as they claim the surviving document does not exist in Nichiren's hand or any of his immediate disciples, rather copied down by Nikko's extant disciples. Instead, such schools claim that Nikko was only a resident priest in Kuonji Temple before 1285, and later became the Chief Priest of that temple from 1285‚Äì1289, just before he moved to the Fujinomiya area. Some of Nikk≈ç's direct disciples also eventually spawned schools that deviated to some degree or another from his own doctrines, often due to political pressure or internal power plays going back and forth to separating or rejoining the Nikko-related temples of the Fujinomiya area before and after the Second World War. == Original Japanese terms == #Ë∫´Âª∂Â±±‰ªòÂò±Êõ∏, also called the Ikegami s≈çj≈ç (Ê±†‰∏äÁõ∏Êâø) \\"Succession document [written at] Ikegami\\" #Êó•ËìÆ‰∏ÄÊúüÂºòÊ≥ï‰ªòÂò±Êõ∏: Nichiren ichigo guh≈ç fuzoku-sho #Êó•ËìÆ‰∏ÄÊúü„ÅÆÂºòÊ≥ï: Nichiren ichigo no guh≈ç #Êú¨ÈñÄÂºòÈÄö„ÅÆÂ§ßÂ∞éÂ∏´: Honmon Guz≈´ no Daid≈çshi ==References== == Sources == * Nikk≈ç Sh≈çnin Nichimoku Sh≈çnin Sh≈çden (Êó•Ëàà‰∏ä‰∫∫ÔΩ•Êó•ÁõÆ‰∏ä‰∫∫Ê≠£‰ºù: \\"Orthodox biography of Nikk≈ç Sh≈çnin and Nichimoku Sh≈çnin\\"), Taisekiji, 1982 * Nichiren Daish≈çnin Sh≈çden (Êó•ËìÆÂ§ßËÅñ‰∫∫Ê≠£‰ºù: \\"Orthodox biography of Nichiren Daish≈çnin\\"), Taisekiji, 1981 * The Life of Nichiren Daishonin.

The Department is headed by the Treasury Solicitor. This office goes back several centuries. The office was enshrined in law by the Treasury Solicitor Act 1876, which established the Treasury Solicitor as a corporation sole (an office with perpetual succession). Employees of the department exercise legal powers which are vested in the corporation sole. The department is a non-ministerial government department and executive agency. The Treasury Solicitor reports to the Attorney General for England and Wales. The department employs more than 1,900 solicitors and barristers to provide advice and legal representation on a huge range of issues to many government departments. ==History== The department was historically known as the Treasury Solicitor's Department, but changed name to the Government Legal Department on 1 April 2015. The new name reflects a \\"significant period of change\\", which saw the department double in size to 2,000 staff. The head of the department combines the ancient office of Queen's Proctor (or King's Proctor) with that of Treasury Solicitor. He has the formal title of Her Majesty's Procurator General and Treasury Solicitor. The office was held by Jonathan Jones until his resignation on 8 September 2020. He is also the Chief Executive of the department as an executive agency. ==Functions== Government Legal Department lawyers work in both advisory and litigation roles. In litigation, lawyers bring and defend legal proceedings involving central government and related bodies. In advisory teams, lawyers provide advice to ministers and civil servants on both the current law and on proposed Government policies and future legislation. The department is the authorised address for service of proceedings on most government departments, by virtue of the list published under the Crown Proceedings Act 1947. In England (with the exception of Lancashire, Manchester and Cornwall, where the function is delegated to Farrer & Co), the Treasury Solicitor is the Crown's nominee for the collection and disposition of ownerless property (bona vacantia). This typically comprises the assets of dissolved companies and the estates of persons who die intestate and with no known kin. == List of HM Procurators-General and Treasury Solicitors  King's Proctor/Procurators General === The office of King's (or Queen's) Proctor is ancient; it also came to be known as HM Procurator General.

The first (The Solicitor for Negotiating and Looking after the Affairs of the Treasury), which existed alone until 1696, had become a sinecure by 1744, and perhaps as early as 1716; from the late 18th century the office included a salary of ¬£200 a year. It was abolished in 1800. A second Treasury Solicitor, the precursor of the modern office, was established in 1696 and was assigned all the legal business undertaken in Westminster Hall; as the first Solicitor became a sinecure, the second Solicitor became the only one responsible for legal business. By 1786, its office-holder was carrying out legal work for other secretaries of state and the Attorney-General, and in the early nineteenth century was employed by other government departments as well. From 1794, the Solicitor was also barred from running their own private practice. The salary began at ¬£500, increased to ¬£1,000 in 1755 and then to ¬£2,000 in 1794; until the 1830s, the Solicitor also charged fees for work done in departments outside the Treasury, but these were then abolished and he received an allowance of ¬£850 in addition to his salary. The whole salary was fixed at ¬£2,000 in 1851, and then increased to ¬£2,500 in 1872.\\"Solicitors and Assistant-Solicitors, 1660‚Äì1870\\", in J. C.

Currently only one \\"Box\\" is available, the ABox, that lets users run existing AmigaOS software compiled for MC680x0 and PowerPC processors. ==Design goals== The Quark microkernel borrows concepts from the L4 microkernel family but is not an L4 implementation itself. For example the clan (group of tasks), ID concept and recursive address mapping comes from L4.

It has been part of the MorphOS operating system since MorphOS 1.4. MorphOS itself has a fully integrated 68k emulator for running many Amiga applications, which were almost exclusively compiled for the 68k processor, while MorphOS itself is PowerPC. Trance supplements this functionality by adding JIT compilation, increasing the speed of the emulation. It does not interfere with the full integration of 68k and PowerPC tasks MorphOS provides. Trance exists in the form of an executable, run during boot, and a shared library. Although it is not technically part of the kernel, and MorphOS can be run without it, Trance is considered a fundamental part of MorphOS and one of its most powerful features. Compatibility of Trance is considered to be very high and there are few to no 68k instruction sequences or applications which cause it any problems. It is also considered to be very fast, with users noticing few differences between 68k programs and native PowerPC code. Trance was developed by Ralph Schmidt and Teemu Suikki, with minor support from other MorphOS team members, Mark Olsen, Sigbj√∏rn Skj√¶ret and Harry Sintonen. ==ABox== Under the Quark kernel a PowerPC native reimplementation of the OS known from the Commodore A1000, A500(+), A600, A2000, A1200, A3000(T) and A4000(T) systems runs as a mixture of a virtual emulation and a driver. This OS driver is called as ABox. The 68k emulation is written in C and uses gcc assembler macros where necessary to speed up certain complex instructions. A JIT (Just In Time) engine called Trance for MorphOS to speed up old 68k programs beyond the current state of the traditional emulation is also available. The PPC native Exec supports the PowerPC register model which means there's no difference for this Exec if it runs 68k or PowerPC code. PowerPC code does not block multitasking inside the OS box like in emulations where the 68k code is just emulated in some host system's task (then every access outside this environment would stop the multitasking in the emulated environment). For applications running under this new PowerPC ABox kernel 68k code runs as subroutines inside PowerPC tasks. For 68k or PowerPC applications it's completely transparent if some library, hook, interrupt is still 68k or already using PowerPC code. ==References== Category:Microkernels Category:MorphOS ","title":"Quark (kernel)"},{"id":"526164","text":"The Arabian Plate is a tectonic plate in the northern and eastern hemispheres. It is one of three continental plates (along with the African and Indian Plates) that have been moving northward in recent geological history and colliding with the Eurasian Plate. This is resulting in a mingling of plate pieces and mountain ranges extending in the west from the Pyrenees, crossing Southern Europe to Iran, forming the Alborz and Zagros Mountains, to the Himalayas and ranges of Southeast Asia. ==Lexicology== The Arabian Plate is the most common designation of the region, although it is also sometimes referred to as the Arab Plate.Unal, Bunyamin, Mucahit Eren, and M. Gurhan Yalcin. \\"Investigation of leakage at Ataturk dam and hydroelectric power plant by means of hydrometric measurements.\\" Engineering Geology 93.1 (2007): 45-63. ==Borders== Eurasian, Anatolian and Arabian (purple coloring) plates The Arabian Plate consists mostly of the Arabian Peninsula; it extends westward at the Sinai Peninsula and the Red Sea and northward to the Levant. The plate borders are: *East, with the Indian Plate, at the Owen Fracture Zone *South, with the African Plate to the west and the Somali Plate and the Indian Plate to the east *West, a left lateral fault boundary with the African Plate called the Dead Sea Transform (DST), and a divergent boundary with the African Plate called the Red Sea Rift which runs the length of the Red Sea; *North, complex convergent boundary with the Anatolian Plate and Eurasian Plate. ==History== The Arabian Plate was part of the African Plate during much of the Phanerozoic Eon (Paleozoic‚ÄìCenozoic), until the Oligocene Epoch of the Cenozoic Era. Red Sea rifting began in the Eocene, but the separation of Africa and Arabia occurred approximately in the Oligocene, and since then the Arabian Plate has been slowly moving toward the Eurasian Plate. The opening of the Red Sea rift led to extensive volcanic activity. There are large volcanic fields called the Older Harrats, such as Harrat Khaybar and Harrat Rahat, cover large parts of the western Arabian Plate. Some activity still continues especially around Medina, and there are regular eruptions within the Red Sea. The collision between the Arabian Plate and Eurasia is pushing up the Zagros Mountains of Iran. Because the Arabian Plate and Eurasian Plate collide, many cities are in danger such as those in southeastern Turkey (which is on the Arabian Plate). These dangers include earthquakes, tsunamis, and volcanoes. ==Countries== Countries within the plate include parts of the Iraq, Levant (eastern Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan), the entire Arabian Peninsula (Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, Yemen), and Djibouti on the Horn of Africa.

The retractability allows the centreboard to be raised to operate in shallow waters, to move the centre of lateral resistance (offsetting changes to the sailplan that move the centre of effort aft), to reduce drag when the full area of the centreboard is not needed, or when removing the boat from the water, as when trailering. A centreboard which consists of just a pivoting metal plate is called a centerplate. A daggerboard is similar but slides vertically rather than pivoting. The analog in a scow is a bilgeboard: these are fitted in pairs and used one at a time. Lt. John Schank (c. 1740 ‚Äì 6 February 1823) was an officer of the British Royal Navy and is credited with the invention of the centerboard. Schank, however, gave credit for the idea to British Brigadier General Earl Percy. ==Function== A centreboard (often called a lifting foil in a modern racing dinghy) is used to provide lift to counter the lateral force from the sails. This is required for sailboats to move in directions other than downwind, since the force of the sail is never closer than 45 degrees to the apparent wind. Since most sailboats are symmetric along their axis of motion, when sailing upright, the lateral force can come from either side, which means that centreboards must use symmetric foil shapes so they will operate with equal efficiency on either tack. The more a yacht heels the more asymmetric its hull shape becomes. The centerboard, daggerboard or bilgeboard can be used as a recovery platform upon which to stand, providing increased leverage, in the event the dinghy overturns via a capsize or turtle. ==Design== The efficiency of a centreboard improves with increasing aspect ratio. A long narrow centreboard produces less drag than a short, wide one for a given amount of lift, resulting in a faster boat that can point closer into the wind. A fore and aft, pivoting centreboard can also be used to move the centre of lateral resistance aft to match a change in sail plan, such as furling or dropping the jib. A retracting centreboard is more complex than a fixed keel, and most take up space inside the hull of the boat that could otherwise be used for passenger accommodation. Other types feature a casing under the boat, which does not take up space but instead has the problem of increased drag. For this reason, it is not uncommon to find boats with a combination of shallow keel and centreboard (e.g. Randmeer). The keel provides the housing for the centreboard, moving it out of the hull, but adds only a small amount of draft to the boat. The centreboard can then be lowered in deeper waters to increase the amount of lift. Ballast is usually provided in the keel, keeping the centreboard lighter and easier to handle. Centreboards are often ballasted in keelboats. Ballasted centreboards are generally not locked in place when lowered; the mass of the ballast keeps them down. This also provides a measure of safety should the boat run aground --the force of impact will push the foil back into the centreboard trunk, rather than breaking it, as might happen if the board were locked in place. The mass of a ballasted foil means that a system of pulleys may be required to allow the sailor to lift the foil, and a method of latching the board in the upward position is needed. A centreboard differs from a ballast keel in that centreboards do not contribute to the stability of the vessel; their purpose is to provide lateral resistance. In small sailing dinghies it is rare to find a ballasted centreboard. On larger sailing vessels, a similar design is sometimes incorporated to facilitate better navigation in shallow water than a fixed keel would allow. In these situations the appendage is generally referred to as a \\"lifting keel\\" (which is usually pivoted but occasionally retracted like a daggerboard) or a \\"swing keel\\". In such installations on offshore vessels, the keel should ideally be lockable in any position, so that it does not fall back into the keel well if the vessel is inverted. When the craft is moving, the centreboard acts as a lifting foil. ==See also== *Bilgeboard *Daggerboard *Dinghy *Dinghy sailing *Dinghy racing *Leeboard *Skeg Category:Sailboat components Category:Sailing ship components Category:Nautical terminology ","title":"Centreboard"},{"id":"526181","text":"Reconstructed pile dwellings in Unteruhldingen.

Elevations range from . ==Geography== Topographic depiction of the Peninsular Mountains within the US consisting of the Santa Ana, Palomar and Laguna Mountains from north to south The Peninsular Ranges include the Santa Ana Mountains, Temescal and other mountains and ranges of the Perris Block, San Jacinto and Laguna ranges of southern California continuing from north to south with the Sierra de Ju√°rez, Sierra de San Pedro M√°rtir, Sierra de San Borja, Sierra de San Francisco, Sierra de la Giganta, and Sierra de la Laguna in Baja California. Palomar Mountain, home to Palomar Observatory, is in the Peninsular Ranges in San Diego County, as are Viejas Mountain and the San Ysidro Mountains. The Peninsular ranges run predominantly north-south, unlike the Transverse Ranges to their north, which mostly run east-west. ==Geology== Rocks in the ranges are dominated by Mesozoic granitic rocks, derived from the same massive batholith which forms the core of the Sierra Nevada Mountains in California. They are part of a geologic province known as the Salinian Block which broke off the North American Plate as the San Andreas Fault and Gulf of California came into being. Between this set of ranges and the Transverse Ranges is the complex Malibu Coast‚ÄîSanta Monica‚ÄîHollywood fault, which exists as the border between these two mostly geologically unitary provinces. ==Ecology and floraNearctic=== View from Inspiration Point in the Laguna Mountains, 2013. Chaparral in the foreground, Anza Borrego Desert State Park on the right of the background. Most of the Peninsular Ranges are in the Nearctic realm. Several terrestrial ecoregions cover portions of the Peninsular Ranges. On western-coast side of the northern portion of the ranges the California montane chaparral and woodlands sub-ecoregion of the California chaparral and woodlands ecoregion covers in southern California and northern Baja California. On western-coast side of the southern portion of the ranges the Baja California desert ecoregion covers in the southern portion of the Peninsular Ranges in Baja California and Baja California Sur. On eastern side of northern ranges, the Sonoran Desert ecoregion covers southeastern California and northeastern Baja California as far south as the town of Loreto, Baja California Sur. On the eastern side of the Laguna Mountains in San Diego County the Anza-Borrego Desert State Park is known for its springtime profusion of Colorado Desert (Sonoran) wildflowers. On eastern-Gulf of California side of the southern portion of the ranges the Gulf of California xeric scrub ecoregion covers the range in Baja California Sur. The higher portions of the Peninsular Ranges, especially the west-facing slopes, are home to coniferous and mixed evergreen forests. Cleveland National Forest covers much of the higher Southern California Peninsular Ranges. The vegetation includes oak woodlands and forests of Jeffrey Pine (Pinus jeffreyi) and Coulter Pine (Pinus coulteri). The Sierra Juarez and San Pedro Martir pine-oak forests cover upper slopes of Sierra Juarez and San Pedro Martir ranges in Baja California. These isolated forests, predominantly Tamarack Pine (Pinus contorta subsp. murrayana), Sugar Pine (Pinus lambertiana), Parry Pinyon (Pinus quadrifolia), White Fir (Abies concolor), California Incense Cedar (Calocedrus decurrens), and junipers. Oak species include Coast Live Oak (Quercus agrifolia), Engelmann Oak (Quercus engelmannii), Canyon Live Oak (Quercus chrysolepis), and Baja Oak (Quercus peninsularis). These higher portions of the Peninsular Ranges harbor many rare and endemic species. ===Neotropic=== Southern Baja California Sur is part of the Neotropical realm. The southern end of the Baja California Peninsula, including the Sierra de la Laguna Peninsular Range, was, like the rest of the peninsula, originally part of the Mexican mainland. It was sheared off the mainland, becoming at one time an island, and evolved in relative isolation from the northern part of the peninsula and ranges. Its flora and fauna share many affinities with southern Mexico and Central America. It includes three distinct ecoregions, the Sierra de la Laguna dry forests, Sierra de la Laguna pine-oak forests, and San Lucan xeric scrub. == See also == *Peninsular Ranges index *Transverse Ranges *List of mountain ranges == References == ==External links== Category:Geologic provinces of California Category:Mountain ranges of Baja California Category:Mountain ranges of Baja California Sur Category:Mountain ranges of Mexico Category:Mountain ranges of San Diego County, California Category:Mountain ranges of Southern California Category:Pacific Coast Ranges Category:Physiographic sections Category:Physiographic regions of Mexico Category:Physiographic regions of the United States ","title":"Peninsular Ranges"},{"id":"526195","text":"Neighborhoods in Berlin-Mitte: Old C√∂lln [1] (with Museum Island [1a], Fisher Island [1b]), Alt-Berlin [2] (with Nikolaiviertel [2a]), Friedrichswerder [3], Neuk√∂lln am Wasser [4], Dorotheenstadt [5], Friedrichstadt [6], Luisenstadt [7], Stralauer Vorstadt (with K√∂nigsstadt) [8], Alexanderplatz Area (K√∂nigsstadt and Altberlin) [9], Spandauer Vorstadt [10] (with Scheunenviertel [10a]), Friedrich-Wilhelm-Stadt [11], Oranienburger Vorstadt [12], Rosenthaler Vorstadt [13] (German: \\"Barn Quarter\\") is a neighborhood of Mitte in the centre of Berlin. It is situated to the north of the medieval Altberlin area, east of the Rosenthaler Stra√üe and Hackescher Markt. Until the Second World War it was regarded as a slum district and had a substantial Jewish population with a high proportion of migrants from Eastern Europe. ==History== The name derives from several barns erected here outside the city walls in 1672 by order of Elector Frederick William of Brandenburg. The barns were used to store hay for use at a large cattle market at nearby Alexanderplatz. In 1737 King Frederick William I of Prussia required Berlin Jews to settle here. Prior to World War I, the Berlin City Council (Magistrat) redeveloped parts of the area. Since then the core of the neighborhood is the triangular Rosa- Luxemburg-Platz, former B√ºlowplatz, where on 9 August 1931 the Communist and later Stasi Executive Erich Mielke shot two police officers. Mielke fled to Moscow shortly afterwards and did not face trial for the murders until 1992. Since German reunification the Scheunenviertel, together with the neighbouring Spandauer Vorstadt, has become a fashionable district popular with younger people. Note that Scheunenviertel is often mistakenly used as a synonym for Berlin's Jewish quarter. Jewish cultural and commercial life was, however, centred on the neighbouring Spandauer Vorstadt, where the New Synagogue and other Jewish establishments are located. ==Sights== Volksb√ºhne at Rosa- Luxemburg-Platz * Volksb√ºhne theatre at Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz by Oskar Kaufmann and Franz Metzner, 1914 * Karl-Liebknecht-Haus, 1912, former seat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Germany (Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands), now headquarters of The Left party (Die Linke) * \\"Babylon\\" Cinema by Hans Poelzig, 1929, a location of the annual Berlin International Film Festival * Old Garrison Cemetery (Alter Garnisonsfriedhof), dedicated about 1706, burial site of lieutenant general Ludwig Adolf Wilhelm von L√ºtzow (1782‚Äì1834), writer Friedrich de la Motte Fouqu√© (1777‚Äì1843), field marshal Karl Friedrich von dem Knesebeck (1768‚Äì1848) and theologian Emil Frommel (1828‚Äì96). * Museum of Otto Weidt's Workshop.

He was one of the founders of the Icelandic journal Fj√∂lnir, which was first published in Copenhagen in 1835. The magazine was used by J√≥nas and his fellow Fj√∂lnismenn to promote Icelandic nationalism, in the hope of giving impetus to the Icelandic Independence Movement. J√≥nas remains one of Iceland's most beloved poets, penning some of the best-known Icelandic poems about Iceland and its people. Since 1996, J√≥nas's birthday has been officially recognised in Iceland as the Day of the Icelandic Language. On 16 November each year, the J√≥nas Hallgr√≠msson Award is awarded to an individual for their outstanding contribution to the Icelandic Language. ==Biography== J√≥nas was born in the north of Iceland, in √ñxnadalur in Eyjafj√∂r√∞ur. He was the son of Hallgr√≠mur √ûorsteinsson, a curate, and Rannveig J√≥nasd√≥ttir. He was the third of their four children; his siblings were √ûorsteinn (born 1800), Rannveig (born 1802) and Anna Margr√©t (born 1815). In 1816 J√≥nas' father drowned in a lake and J√≥nas was sent to live with his aunt. In 1821 he returned home to √ñxnadalur to be confirmed, before going away to a school in Skagafj√∂r√∞ur, where he was taught by the Reverend Einar H. Thorlacius. He studied there for two years, and won a scholarship to attend the school at Bessasta√∞ir for a further six. After passing his final examinations in 1829, J√≥nas moved to Reykjav√≠k and was employed by a sheriff as a clerk, living in his home. During this time, he also worked as a defence lawyer. It is said that sometime in the winter of 1831‚Äì1832, J√≥nas proposed to a woman called Christiane Knudsen, but he was rejected. He was heartbroken. In 1832 he sailed to Denmark, and passed the entrance exam for the University of Copenhagen. He began working for a law degree, but after four years switched to literature and natural sciences, excelling in both subjects. In 1835, along with fellow Icelandic students Brynj√≥lfur P√©tursson, Konr√°√∞ G√≠slason and T√≥mas S√¶mundsson, he founded the patriotic journal Fj√∂lnir. After graduation he was awarded a grant from the state treasury to conduct scientific research in Iceland, a project which he worked on from 1839 to 1842. He continued to pursue his interest in the natural history of Iceland, and to work on Fj√∂lnir throughout his life, dividing his time between Denmark and research trips to Iceland. It was in Fj√∂lnir that many of his poems and essays first appeared. J√≥nas also worked as a translator of foreign material, including scientific works. In these can be found many of the Icelandic words coined by J√≥nas. One of these, for an example, is reikistjarna, meaning planet. This is a compound word from the verb a√∞ reika (to wander) and the noun stjarna (star). On 21 May 1845 in Copenhagen, J√≥nas slipped on the stairs up to his room and broke his leg. He went to the hospital the next day, but died of blood poisoning, aged only 37. ==Style== J√≥nas is considered one of the founding fathers, and best examples, of romanticism in Iceland. The imagery in his poetry was strongly influenced by the Icelandic landscape. He is also known for introducing foreign metres, such as pentameter, to Icelandic poetry. :Charming and fair is the land, ::and snow-white the peaks of the jokuls [glaciers], :Cloudless and blue is the sky, ::the ocean is shimmering bright, :But high on the lave fields, where ::still Osar river is flowing :Down into Almanna gorge, ::Althing no longer is held, :Now Snorri's booth serves as a sheepfold, ::the ling upon Logberg the sacred :Is blue with berries every year, ::for children's and ravens' delight. :Oh, ye juvenile host ::and full-grown manhood of Iceland! :Thus is our forefathers' fame ::forgotten and dormant withal.

Gislason Beck, Richard, editor, Icelandic Lyrics: Originals and Translations, Thorhallur Bjarnarson, Publisher, Post Box 1001, Reykjavik 1930 ==Controversy over J√≥nas' Remains== In 1946, the bones of J√≥nas Hallgr√≠msson were moved from Copenhagen to Iceland in a controversy known in Icelandic as the beinam√°li√∞ ('bones question').J√≥n Karl Helgason, Fer√∞alok: Sk√Ωrsla handa akadem√≠u (Reykjav√≠k: Bjartur, 2003). While ostensibly a national triumph, the reburial has been argued to have been an enormously problematic exercise in hegemony by Iceland's post-independence elites and ‚Äúinstead of uniting the nation, the episode uncovered a great divide within the people of Iceland.‚ÄùJ√≥n Karl Helgason, 'A Poet‚Äôs Great Return: J√≥nas Hallgr√≠msson‚Äôs Reburial and Milan Kundera‚Äôs Ignorance', Scandinavian-Canadian Studies/√âtudes scandinaves au Canada, 20 (2011), 52-61 (p. 53), http://scancan.net/article.pdf?id=helgason_1_20 (PDF), http://scancan.net/article.htm?id=helgason_1_20 (XHTML). Cf. J√≥n Karl Helgason, Fer√∞alok: Sk√Ωrsla handa akadem√≠u (Reykjav√≠k: Bjartur, 2003). The main campaigner behind this was Sigurj√≥n P√©tursson, an admirer of J√≥nas who claimed to be in telepathic communication with the dead poet and wanted to re- bury his remains in √ñxnadalur, where J√≥nas grew up.J√≥n Karl Helgason, 'A Poet‚Äôs Great Return: J√≥nas Hallgr√≠msson‚Äôs Reburial and Milan Kundera‚Äôs Ignorance', Scandinavian-Canadian Studies/√âtudes scandinaves au Canada, 20 (2011), 52-61, http://scancan.net/article.pdf?id=helgason_1_20 (PDF), http://scancan.net/article.htm?id=helgason_1_20 (XHTML). Sigurj√≥n came up against serious opposition from a number of the political √©lite, including √ìlafur Thors, who was then Prime Minister of Iceland. The government informed him that J√≥nas' bones were state property, and would be buried at the national burial ground at √ûingvellir, alongside the poet Einar Benediktsson. However, the government proved unwilling to finance the excavation and transportation. Sigurj√≥n covered most of the cost, even paying for Matth√≠as √û√≥r√∞arson, the director of the National Museum, to oversee the excavation. The process was a lengthy one, because a father and son had been buried on top of J√≥nas in 1875, and another couple in 1900, and they needed to be excavated first. Finally, Sigurj√≥n was able to transport the remains to Iceland. He drove north with them, intending to bury them in √ñxnadalur in defiance of the government, but the priests there refused to perform the rites. The coffin stood in a church for a week before being driven back south and buried in the government's chosen spot on 16 November, J√≥nas' birthday. Since 1996, the date has been celebrated in Iceland as Icelandic Language Day. The controversy, its motivations and outcomes were satirised by, amongst others, Halld√≥r Laxness's 1948 novel At√≥mst√∂√∞in and Milan Kundera's Ignorance.J√≥n Karl Helgason, 'A Poet‚Äôs Great Return: J√≥nas Hallgr√≠msson‚Äôs Reburial and Milan Kundera‚Äôs Ignorance', Scandinavian-Canadian Studies/√âtudes scandinaves au Canada, 20 (2011), 52-61 (p. 53), http://scancan.net/article.pdf?id=helgason_1_20 (PDF), http://scancan.net/article.htm?id=helgason_1_20 (XHTML).

Most often, it refers to a former monarch, or descendant thereof, whose throne is occupied, claimed by a rival or has been abolished.Valynseele, Joseph. Les Pr√©tendants aux tr√¥nes d'Europe. Paris, 1967, p. 11, 187‚Äì190 (French).Curley, Jr., Walter J.P. Monarchs-in-Waiting. New York, 1973, pp. 4‚Äì6, 10. . The term \\"claimant\\" is sometimes preferred, but the term \\"pretend\\" in itself is not pejorative in this context. The original meaning of the English word pretend comes from the French word pr√©tendre (and before that, the Latin praetendo meaning \\"to stretch out before\\"),Cassell's Latin Dictionary, ed. Marchant & Charles and originally meant \\"to put forward, to profess or claim\\". A pretender was, therefore, simply one who put forward or professed a claim to a title or, in modern terms, a claimant. Only later did the word acquire its modern sense of professing or claiming falsely. The term \\"pretender\\" may apply to claimants with arguably genuine rights (as the various pretenders of the Wars of the Roses who regarded the de facto monarch as a usurper). It may also be used for those possessing an arguable right to a position who do not actively claim it, as well as impostors with wholly fabricated claims (as pretenders to Henry VII's throne Lambert Simnel and Perkin Warbeck attest). People in the latter category often assume the identities of deceased or missing royalty to support their claim, and are sometimes referred to for clarity as false pretenders or royal impersonators. A pretender to the title of Pope is called an antipope.See for example of revisionist use of the term upon Antipope Christopher. ==In the Roman Empire== Ancient Rome knew many pretenders to the offices making up the title of Roman Emperor, especially during the Crisis of the Third Century. These are customarily referred to as the Thirty Tyrants, which was an allusion to the Thirty Tyrants of Athens some five hundred years earlier; although the comparison is questionable, and the Romans were separate aspirants, not (as the Athenians were) a Committee of Public Safety. The Loeb translation of the appropriate chapter of the Augustan History therefore represents the Latin triginta tyranni by \\"Thirty Pretenders\\" to avoid this artificial and confusing parallel. Not all of them were afterwards considered pretenders; several were actually successful in becoming Emperor at least in part of the Empire for a brief period. ==Greek pretendersByzantine Empire=== Disputed successions to the Roman (Byzantine) Empire long continued at Constantinople. Most seriously, after the fall of Constantinople to the Fourth Crusade in 1204, and its eventual recovery by Michael VIII Palaiologos, there came to be three Byzantine successor states, each of which claimed to be the Roman Empire, and several Latin claimants (including the Republic of Venice and the houses of Montferrat and Courtenay) to the Latin Empire the Crusaders had set up in its place. At times, some of these states and titles were subjected to multiple claims. ===Cypriot pretenders=== Following the defeat and death of King James III King of Cyprus in 1474, his younger and illegitimate brother, Eug√®ne Matteo de Lusignan, also styled d'Arm√©nie (died 1523) removed to Sicily, then to Malta. He was acknowledged as rightful heir to the thrones of Cyprus, Armenia, Jerusalem, and Antioch, although he never made serious efforts to pursue the claims. The title of \\"Barone de Baccari\\" was created in 1508 for Jacques Matteo (sives Eugene Matteo) d'Armenia with the remainder to his descendants in perpetuity. Eugene, illegitimate son of King Jacques II of Cyprus, had, when his family were exiled, first gone to Naples, then Sicily, then settled on Malta, marrying a Sicilian heiress, Donna Paola Mazzara (a descendant of the Royal House of Aragon of Sicily and Aragon), with issue.Leto Severis, Ladies of Medieval Cyprus and Caterina Cornaro; Nicosia: 1995; . ===Modern Greece=== The claimant to the throne of the last Greek kingdom is Constantine II, who reigned as king from 1964 to 1973. He belongs to the House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl√ºcksburg, the senior branch of the House of Oldenburg. His designated heir is his son Pavlos, Crown Prince of Greece. ==French pretenders== The establishment of the First Republic and the execution of Louis XVI in 1793 led to the king's son becoming pretender to the abolished throne, styled as Louis XVII. As Louis XVII was a child and imprisoned in Paris by the revolutionaries, his uncle, the Comte de Provence, proclaimed himself regent in his nephew's name. After Louis XVII died in 1795, the Comte de Provence became pretender himself, as Louis XVIII. Louis XVIII was restored to the throne in 1814, and was succeeded by his brother Charles X in 1824. Charles X was, however, forced into exile by the July Revolution. Charles X and his son, Louis-Antoine, Duke of Angoul√™me, abdicated their claims in favor of Charles's grandson, Henri, Count of Chambord; however, their cousin the Duke of Orl√©ans, a descendant of Louis XIV's younger brother, mounted the throne as Louis Philippe I, King of the French. For most of the July Monarchy, the legitimists, as supporters of the exiled senior line came to be known, were uncertain of whom to support. Some believed the abdication of Charles and his son legal, and recognized the young Chambord as king, while others maintained that abdication was unconstitutional in France of the ancien r√©gime, and continued to recognize first Charles X and then Louis-Antoine, until the latter's death in 1844. On his uncle's death, Chambord claimed the crown, but lived in exile and upon his death in 1883, the direct male-line of Louis XV became extinct. In 1848, Louis Philippe was himself overthrown by the February Revolution, and abdicated the throne in favor of his young grandson, Philippe, Comte de Paris. However, a republic was proclaimed, leaving Paris, like his cousin Chambord, merely a pretender to a no longer existing crown. Over the next several decades, there were several attempts at a so-called \\"fusion\\", to unite both groups of monarchists in support of the childless Chambord as king, who would recognize the Count of Paris as his heir. Those efforts failed in the 1850s, but after the establishment of the Third Republic in 1870, when a royalist majority was elected to the Chamber of Deputies, fusion again became the monarchist strategy. As a result, in 1873 the Count of Paris withdrew his own bid for the throne and recognized Chambord as legitimate pretender to the French crown. In spite of this apparent unity among royalist forces, restoration of the monarchy was not to be; Chambord refused to accept the Tricolor flag, which rendered him unacceptable to most Frenchmen as a constitutional king. The monarchists hoped that after Chambord's death they could unite and crown the Orl√©anist candidate. But Chambord lived until 1883, while France's royalists had lost their majority in parliament by 1877. The erstwhile Orl√©anist Adolphe Thiers thus called Chambord \\"The French Washington\\", i.e. the true \\"founder\\" of the Republic. By 1883 the majority of French monarchists accepted the Count of Paris as rightful pretender to the French throne. A minority of reactionaries, the so- called Blancs d'Espagne (\\"Spanish Whites\\"), continued to withhold support from the House of Orl√©ans and chose instead Juan, Count of Montizon, the Carlist pretender to the Spanish throne, who also happened to be the senior male descendant of Louis XIV. The arguments are, on one side, that Louis XIV's younger grandson, Philip de Bourbon, Duke of Anjou renounced any future claim to the French throne when he left France to become king of Spain as Philip V in 1700 (the renunciation was ratified internationally by the Treaty of Utrecht), ostensibly leaving the Dukes of Orl√©ans as heirs to the throne of France in the event of extinction of descendants of Louis XIV's elder grandson Louis, Duke of Burgundy, which occurred in 1883. On the other side, Anjou's renunciation is held to be invalid because prior to the revolution it was a fundamental tenet of the French monarchy that the crown could never be diverted from the rightful heir of Hugh Capet. Moreover, although the Orl√©ans volunteered to defer their rival claim to the throne after 1873, the regicidal vote of their ancestor Philippe √âgalit√© in 1789 and the usurpation of Louis Philippe in 1830 are alleged to have extinguished all rights to the throne for the Orl√©ans branch. The schism has continued to the present day, with supporters of the senior line reclaiming the title of \\"Legitimist\\", leaving their opponent royalists to be known, once again, as \\"Orl√©anists\\". The current representative of the senior line is Louis Alphonse, Duke of Anjou, the senior legitimate living descendant of Hugh Capet (and of Philip V d'Anjou of Spain) who was born and raised in Spain. The Orl√©anist line, which returned to live in France when the law of banishment was repealed in 1950, is represented by Prince Jean, Duke of Vend√¥me, senior male-line descendant of King Louis Philippe. In addition to these two claims to the historic royal throne of France, there have also been pretenders to the imperial throne of France, created first by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1804 and recreated by his nephew Emperor Napoleon III in 1852 (abolished 1870). This claim is today disputed between Jean-Christophe, Prince Napol√©on and his own father, the self-avowed republican Prince Charles Napol√©on (deemed to be excluded from the succession due to a non-dynastic re-marriage), both descendants of Napoleon I's youngest brother, J√©r√¥me Bonaparte. ==Russian pretenders== There is much debate over who is the legitimate heir to the Russian throne, and bitter dispute within the family itself.Massie, Robert K. The Romanovs: The Final Chapter. New York, 1995, p. 278. . Grand Duchess Maria Vladimirovna is considered by some to be the legitimate heir.de Badts de Cugnac, Chantal. Coutant de Saisseval, Guy. Le Petit Gotha. Nouvelle Imprimerie Laballery, Paris 2002, p. 702 (French) She is the only child of Grand Duke Vladimir who died in 1992, a great-grandson of Tsar Alexander II, whom some considered the last male dynast of the House of Romanov. Some of her opponents believe she is ineligible to claim the throne because she was born of a marriage that would have been deemed morganatic under Russia's monarchy, which was abolished in 1917. Others oppose her for reasons similar to those of the anti-Orleanist rationale: her grandfather's perceived disloyalty and dynastic ambition are seen as removing any rights which might otherwise have belonged to her branch of the former dynasty. Still others maintain that the restrictive, pre-revolutionary marital rules of the Romanovs leave no one who can claim to be rightful heir to the dynasty's legacy. Others recognized Nicholas Romanov, Prince of Russia as head of the family, being a descendant of Emperor Nicholas I and the elected president of the Romanov Family Association, which consists of most living male-line descendants of the Romanov emperors. Neither he nor his younger brother, Prince Dimitri Romanov, had sons and since their deaths no new claims have been advanced by this branch. Anna Anderson attempted to prove she was Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia, the lost daughter of Nicholas II, but DNA testing on her remains eventually proved her to be an impersonator.Massie, Robert K. The Romanovs: The Final Chapter. New York, 1995, pp. 239, 251. . Although she did not claim the throne, per se, as women could not succeed to the Russian throne so long as any male dynast survived, she became more famous than any of the various Romanov claimants to the throne. Karl Emich of Leiningen, also known under his Christian Orthodox name Nikolai Kirillovich Romanov Prince Karl Emich of Leiningen (born 1952), who converted to the Eastern Orthodoxy in 2013, n:ru:–ú–æ–Ω–∞—Ä—Ö–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∞—è –ø–∞—Ä—Ç–∏—è –æ–±—ä—è–≤–∏–ª–∞ –æ–± –æ–±—Ä–µ—Ç–µ–Ω–∏–∏ –Ω–∞—Å–ª–µ–¥–Ω–∏–∫–∞ —Ä–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –ò–º–ø–µ—Ä–∞—Ç–æ—Ä—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –ø—Ä–µ—Å—Ç–æ–ª–∞ ‚Äî Russian Wikinews, 11.06.2013 is the latest pretender to the Russian throne under the name of Prince Nikolai Kirillovich of Leiningen. He is the grandson of Grand Duchess Maria Cyrillovna of Russia, (sister of Vladimir, and aunt of Maria Vladimirovna), and great- grandson of Cyril Vladimirovich, Grand Duke of Russia. The Monarchist Party of Russia supports Prince Nikolai as the heir of the Russian throne, since they are of the opinion that Maria Vladimirovna Romanova and Nicholas Romanov are not dynasts. In early 2014, Nikolai Kirilovich declared himself Emperor Nicholas III (successor to Nicholas II). In 2007 Nicholas married Countess Isabelle von und zu Egloffstein and in 2010 had a son, Emich. ==British pretendersEngland, Scotland and Ireland=== After the execution by England of the Stuart King Charles I in 1649, his son Charles II was proclaimed king in Scotland (where he was crowned in 1651) and Ireland; but those two countries were invaded by English forces and annexed to the Commonwealth of England under Oliver Cromwell in 1653. Thus, Charles II was pretender to the throne of England from 1649 to the restoration of 1660, and exiled/deposed King of Scots and King of Ireland, 1653 to 1660. He died in 1685 and his brother James II and VII came to the throne. He had converted to Catholicism but this only became a worry when his second wife bore a son who would precede his two Protestant daughters. James was thus deposed by his elder daughter and his son-in-law (who was also his nephew, son of his sister Mary) during the Glorious Revolution in December 1688, and was formally offered the English and Scottish thrones by their respective parliaments a month later - which was still 1688 in England (where New Year's Day was 25 March until 1752) but was already 1689 in Scotland (which adopted 1 January as New Year's Day in 1600). James made several attempts to regain the throne before his death in 1701, the most important of which was an effort he made with Irish support - that country having not yet acceded to the succession of William and Mary - which led to the Battle of the Boyne and the Battle of Aughrim, and set the stage for the subsequent Jacobite risings (or rebellions). These were a series of uprisings or wars between 1688 and 1746 in which supporters of James, his son (\\"The Old Pretender\\") and grandson (\\"The Young Pretender\\") attempted to restore his direct male line to the throne. * James Francis Edward Stuart, the Roman Catholic son of the deposed James II and VII, was barred from the succession to the throne by the Act of Settlement 1701. Notwithstanding the Act of Union 1707, he claimed the separate thrones of Scotland, as James VIII, and of England and Ireland, as James III, until his death in 1766. In Jacobite terms, Acts of Parliament (of England or Scotland) after 1688, (including the Acts of Union) did not receive the required Royal Assent of the legitimate Jacobite monarch and, therefore, were without legal effect. James was responsible for a number of conspiracies and rebellions, particularly in the Highlands of Scotland. The most notable was the Jacobite rising of 1715‚Äì16. * Charles Edward Stuart (\\"Bonnie Prince Charlie\\"), James Francis' elder son and the would-be Charles III, who led in his father's name the last major Jacobite rebellion, the Jacobite rising of 1745‚Äì46. He died in 1788 without legitimate issue. * Henry Benedict Stuart (best known as the Cardinal-Duke of York), the younger brother of Charles Edward and a Roman Catholic Cardinal, who took up the claim to the throne as the would-be Henry IX of England, though he was the final Jacobite heir to publicly do so. He died unmarried in 1807. After 1807, the line of James VII and II became extinct. The Jacobites had ceased to have much political significance after the failure of the 1745 uprising, and the movement essentially became completely dormant after Henry's death. Genealogically, the next most senior line to the English and Scottish thrones was through James II's youngest sister, Henriette Anne, whose daughter had married into the House of Savoy. To the very limited extent that Jacobitism survived the death of Cardinal York, they supported the claims of this line. Its current representative is Franz, Duke of Bavaria, though he himself does not claim the title, his secretary having announced once that \\"HRM (sic) is very content being a Prince of Bavaria\\". Other pretenders to the throne have included: *Lambert Simnel (c. 1477 ‚Äì c. 1525) was a pretender to the throne of England. His claim to be Edward Plantagenet, 17th Earl of Warwick in 1487 threatened the newly established reign of King Henry VII (reigned 1485‚Äì1509). This was just after The Wars of the Roses. He was just a boy but was used to try to take over the Kingdom. * Perkin Warbeck, a Fleming who claimed to be Richard of Shrewsbury, Duke of York, and tried twice to invade England and capture the throne in the late 15th Century. ===Wales=== Owain Glynd≈µr (1349‚Äì1416) is probably the best-known Welsh pretender, though whether he was pretender or Prince of Wales depends upon one's source of information. Llywelyn ap Gruffydd ap Llywelyn, who died in 1282, was the only Prince of Wales whose status as ruler was formally recognised by the English Crown, though three of the four men who claimed the throne of Gwynedd between the assumption of the title by Owain Gwynedd in the 1160s and the loss of Welsh independence in 1283 also used the title or similar. Madog ap Llywelyn also briefly used the title during his revolt of 1294‚Äì95. Since 1301, the title of Prince of Wales has been given to the eldest living son of the King or Queen Regnant of England (subsequently of Great Britain, 1707, and of United Kingdom, 1801). The word \\"living\\" is important. Upon the death of Arthur, Prince of Wales, Henry VII invested his second son, the future Henry VIII, with the title. The title is not automatic, however, but merges into the Crown when a prince dies or accedes to the throne, and has to be re-conferred by the sovereign. Nevertheless, it is Glynd≈µr whom many remember as the last native Prince of Wales. He was indeed proclaimed Prince of Wales by his supporters on 16 September 1400, and his revolt in quest of Welsh independence was not quashed by Henry IV until 1409. Later, however, one of Glynd≈µr's cousins, Owain Tudor, would marry the widow of Henry V, and their grandson would become Henry VII, from whom the current British monarch is descended (through his daughter Margaret Tudor, who married James IV of Scotland). The various minor kingdoms that came together to form what is today known as the Principality of Wales each had their own royal dynasty. The most important of these realms were Gwynedd, Powys and Deheubarth. After 878 the ruling dynasties in these kingdoms each claimed descent from the sons of Rhodri Mawr who had conquered them or otherwise achieved their thrones during his reign. Merfyn Frych, the father of Rhodri Mawr, had come to power in Gwynedd because the native dynasty, known as the House of Cunedda had expired. Merfyn was descended from royalty through his own father Gwriad and claimed ancestors from among the rulers of British Rheged (in particular Llywarch Hen). It was acknowledged by all of the realms of Wales after the time of Rhodri Mawr that the House of Gwynedd (known as the House of Aberffraw) was senior and homage should be paid by each of them to the king of Gwynedd. After the reign of Owain ap Gruffudd of Gwynedd the realm began to merge with the concept of a Principality of Wales. This was realised by Owain's descendant Llywelyn ap Gruffudd in 1267. It was not to last and this new Wales was invaded by England and dismantled between 1277 and 1284. All of the descendants of Llywelyn \\"the last\\" and his brothers were either imprisoned or killed. ==Irish pretenders== The business of Irish pretenders is rather more complicated because of the nature of kingship in Ireland before the Norman take-over of 1171. In both Ireland and early Gaelic Scotland, succession to kingship was elective, often (if not usually) by contest, according to a system known as Tanistry. The High King of Ireland (Ard R√≠) was essentially a ceremonial, federal overlord, who exercised actual power only within the realm which was his dynastic seat. Because of the laws of succession, there could not be a pretender to this title in the sense it is normally understood. From the 5th century onwards the kingship tended to remain within the dynasty of the U√≠ N√©ill until Brian Boru of Munster wrested control of much of Ireland from M√°el Sechnaill mac Domnaill in 1002. Following his death in 1014 and that of M√°el Sechnaill in 1022, the struggle for dominance resulted in Norman intervention from Henry II of England in 1171. There were later attempts by Irish rulers fighting against the Normans to revive the High Kingship such as in 1258 when Brian Ua N√©ill of Cenel Eoghan was so acknowledged, in 1262 when the crown was offered to Haakon IV of Norway and in 1315 when an offer was made to the Scottish Edward Bruce. Effectively, the title fell into abeyance. Apart from the coronation oath, the title was not even used by the Kings of England, each of whom styled himself Lord of Ireland. In 1542 Henry VIII, styled himself \\"King of Ireland\\". Some Irish rebels discussed offering the Irish throne to Prince Joachim of Prussia (son of Kaiser Wilhelm II) before the 1916 Easter Rising.Memoirs of Desmond FitzGerald, 1913-1916, Desmond FitzGerald; Routledge & K. Paul, 1968, page 141Irish nationalism: a history of its roots and ideology, Se√°n Cronin, Continuum, 1981, page 255 After the failure of the Rising, the royalists were a minority among the rebels, and so the offer was never made. According to Hugo O'Donnell, 7th Duke of Tetuan, √âamon de Valera raised the idea of an Irish monarchy with his great-grandfather Juan O'Donnell.Ireland In The 20th Century, Tim Pat Coogan, page 175 ==Ottoman pretenders== Cem Sultan, eldest of the sons of Mehmet the Conqueror born during his reign, claimed the Sultanate, but born during the reign of his father, he was defeated in battle months later by his eldest brother (by birth) Bayezid II. He fled to the island of Rhodes, then eventually to the Papal States. His descendants claimed his rights until Malta defeated the Ottomans in the 16th century. After the Ottoman Empire was abolished and the Republic of Turkey came into power, the successive heads of the Ottoman family claimed the throne of the Turkish empire. The latest pretender to the Imperial House of Osman is D√ºndar Ali Osman, since January 6, 2017. ==Kingdom of Jerusalem== The Emperors of Ethiopia held the title of \\"King of Zion\\" through their claim of descent from the Biblical House of David through his son King Solomon. Menelik II dropped the use of this title. The Ethiopian Emperors continued to use the honorific of \\"Conquering Lion of the Tribe of Judah\\" up until the monarchy ended with the fall of Emperor Haile Selassie in 1974. Since the fall of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, many European rulers have claimed to be its rightful heir. None of these, however, have actually ruled over a part of the former Kingdom. Today there are several potential European claimants on the basis of the inheritance of the title. None of the claimants have any power in the area of the former Kingdom. See the article Kings of Jerusalem for a list of potential claimants. ==Japanese pretenders== In the fourteenth century, two lines of the Imperial clan, Northern Court and Southern Court, claimed the throne.Nussbaum, Louis Fr√©d√©ric and K√§the Roth. (2005). Japan Encyclopedia, p. 251; n.b., Louis- Fr√©d√©ric is the pseudonym of Louis-Fr√©d√©ric Nussbaum, see Deutsche Nationalbibliothek Authority File . Their rivalry was resolved in 1392: while every emperor of the Southern Court enthroned prior to 1392 was established as legitimate, the throne was determined by Emperor Go-Komatsu of the Northern Court and his successors. Since 1911, the Japanese government has declared the southern claimants were actually the rightful emperors despite the fact that all subsequent emperors including the then-Emperor Meiji were descended from the Northern Court, reasoning the Southern Court retained possession of the Three Sacred Treasures, thus converting the emperors of the former Northern court into mere pretenders. In other words, six former emperors of the Northern Court have been counted as pretenders instead since then. As a result of this compromise, the present Japanese Imperial Family is descended of the Northern Court Emperors. Kumazawa Hiromichi publicly challenged Emperor Hirohito, disputing the legitimacy of his bloodline.Bix, Herbert P. (2000). Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan, p. 566. Kumazawa claimed to be the 19th direct descendant of Emperor Go-Kameyama,Pan-Asia Newspaper Alliance. (1959) The Asia Who's Who, p. 309. the last Emperor of the Southern Court. ==False pretenders== A number of individuals have claimed to be displaced monarchs or heirs who disappeared or died under somewhat mysterious circumstances: * Bertrand of Rais (or Ray), who claimed to be Baldwin I of Constantinople * Lambert Simnel, who claimed to be Edward Plantagenet, 17th Earl of Warwick * Perkin Warbeck, who claimed to be Richard of Shrewsbury, 1st Duke of York * Yemelyan Pugachev, who claimed to be Peter III of Russia * False Dmitry I, actually reigned as Tsar of Russia for nearly a year before he was killed in a riot **False Dmitry II **False Dmitry III * Karl Wilhelm Naundorff, who was one of over thirty persons who claimed to be Louis XVII of France * Kaspar Hauser, who was claimed to be the stillborn son of Karl, Grand Duke of Baden * False Margaret, who claimed to be Margaret, Maid of Norway ==Claimant descendants of royalty== There have also been individuals who claimed to be descendants of royalty: * Eugenio Lascorz, who claimed descent from the Lascaris of Byzantium * Anna Anderson, who was one of several persons who claimed to be Grand Duchess Anastasia of Russia * Alexis Brimeyer, who claimed connections to various European royal houses * Pierre Plantard, who claimed descent from Merovingian king Dagobert II * Michel Roger Lafosse, who claims descent from Charles Edward Stuart * Anthony William Hall, who claimed descent from an alleged premarital son of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, and the throne against George V in the 1930s * Kumazawa Hiromichi (so-called \\"The Kumazawa Tenno\\"), who claimed descent from the last Tenno of Nancho (the Southern Court) of Japan * Obren Christic, the acknowledged illegitimate son of Milan I of Serbia. * Maria Pia of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha Braganza, claimed as adulterine (but legitimated) daughter of Carlos I of Portugal. * Tauatomo Mairau, recognised heir to the Tahitian throne, who attempted to re-assert the status of the monarchy in court. * Siarke, indigenous Bribri nobleman and nephew of Antonio Salda√±a, last king of Talamanca, Costa Rica, who unsuccessfully claimed the title in 1910 after his uncle's demise. ==See also== * Heads of former ruling families * List of Indian princely states * Royal house * Micronation * Monarchism * Order of succession * Anti-king * Antipope ==References and notes== ","title":"Pretender"},{"id":"526211","text":"''''', literally translated \\"Germans of the \\", is an archaic term for those ethnic Germans who resided within the German state that was founded in 1871. In contemporary usage, it referred to German citizens, the word signifying people from the German ', i.e., Imperial Germany or ', which was the official name of Germany between 1871 and 1949. The opposite of the ' is, then, depending on context and historical period, ', ' (however, usually meaning German citizens living abroad), or a more specific term denoting the area of settlement, such as Baltic Germans or Volga Germans ('). ==Term== The key problem with the terms ', ', ' (of German descent, as to citizenship or ethnicity), and related ones is that the usage of the words often depends on context, i.e. who uses them where and when. There are, in that sense, no general legal or \\"right\\" definitions, although during the 20th century, all terms acquired legal ‚Äî yet also changing ‚Äî definitions. The reason for the differentiation is that there has been a historical shift in the meaning of what belonging to a nation means. Until the early 19th century, a demonym such as \\"German\\" ‚Äî apart from the ' vernacular ‚Äî was not too meaningful, although at least since the German Campaign of the Napoleonic Wars, the concept certainly existed. If anything, it was more seen as a cultural concept. The idea of a ', as advocated by philosophers like (1744‚Äì1803) and (1762‚Äì1814), includes German first language, religion (in different forms), and already sometimes German origin, descent or race in a vague sense. With the 1871 unification of Germany under Prussian leadership, the concept of the German people first acquired a legal-political meaning, which they have retained until now. However, the German Empire as a \\"Lesser German\\" answer to the German Question, did not encompass more than two thirds of the German ' (language area). For someone who considered themselves German but living abroad, e.g., in multi-ethnic Austria-Hungary, ' meant any German who was a citizen of the German , as opposed to someone living abroad (and usually without a German passport). Part of the identity of ethnic German minorities living abroad ‚Äî a classic example are the Baltic Germans ‚Äî was to define themselves as German, using the pre-1871 concept. However, ' visiting the Russian Baltic governorates in the late 19th century, for instance, resented the claims of the Baltic Germans to be German ‚Äî for the Germans from the Reich, to be German meant to be a German citizen, while for the Baltic Germans, it meant cultural-historical belonging. It was however not until the German nationality law (') of 1913 finally established the citizenship of the German Reich, whereas earlier political rights (including the claim to receive identity papers and passports) derived from one's citizenship of one of the States of the German Empire. The citizens of some German states comprised also autochthonous or immigrant ethnic minorities of other than German ethnicity, which is why citizens of the German Empire always also comprised people of other ethnicity than the German (e.g. Danish, French, Frisian, Polish, Romani, Sorbian etc.). German citizenship is passed on from parent to child (') whatever their ethnicity is. With naturalisation of aliens as German citizens, however, their eventual German ethnicity formed or still forms an advantage under certain circumstances (see '). In Nazi Germany, the ' of 1935, part of the Nuremberg Laws established the legal status of ', i.e. German citizens \\"of German or congeneric blood\\". As a result, Jews and \\"'\\" officially became second-class citizens. After World War II and the establishment of the West German Federal Republic of Germany in 1949, the analogous terms ' (i.e., Federal Germans) and ' (i.e., Federal citizens) were colloquially used to distinguish ' citizens from people entitled to German citizenship, but as a matter of fact unwilling or unable to exercise it, such as citizens of East Germany (') and East Berlin, or of the Saar Protectorate.

The ISO was designed to study infrared light at wavelengths of 2.5 to 240 micrometres and operated from 1995 to 1998. The ‚Ç¨480.1-million satellite was launched on 17 November 1995 from the ELA-2 launch pad at the Guiana Space Centre near Kourou in French Guiana. The launch vehicle, an Ariane 44P rocket, placed ISO successfully into a highly elliptical geocentric orbit, completing one revolution around the Earth every 24 hours. The primary mirror of its Ritchey-Chr√©tien telescope measured 60 cm in diameter and was cooled to 1.7 kelvins by means of superfluid helium. The ISO satellite contained four instruments that allowed for imaging and photometry from 2.5 to 240 micrometres and spectroscopy from 2.5 to 196.8 micrometers. Currently, ESA and IPAC continue efforts to improve the data pipelines and specialized software analysis tools to yield the best quality calibration and data reduction methods from the mission. IPAC supports ISO observers and data archive users through in-house visits and workshops. == History and development == In 1983 the US-Dutch-British IRAS inaugurated space-based infrared astronomy by performing the first-ever 'all-sky survey' at infrared wavelengths. The resulting map of the infrared sky pinpointed some 350,000 infrared sources waiting to be explored by IRAS' successors. In 1979 IRAS was in an advanced stage of planning and the expected results from IRAS led to the first proposal for ISO made to ESA in the same year. With the rapid improvements in infrared detector-technology, ISO was to provide detailed observations for some 30,000 infrared sources with much improved sensitivity and resolution. ISO was to perform 1000 times better in sensitivity and 100 times better in angular resolution at 12 micrometres compared to IRAS. A number of follow-up studies resulted in the selection of ISO as the next installment for the ESA Scientific Programme in 1983. Next came a Call for Experiment and Mission Scientist Proposals to the scientific community, resulting in the selection of the scientific instruments in 1985. The four instruments chosen were developed by teams of researchers from France, Germany, the Netherlands and United Kingdom. Design and development of the satellite started in 1986 with A√©rospatiale's space division (currently absorbed into Thales Alenia Space) leading an international consortium of 32 companies responsible for manufacture, integration and testing of the new satellite. Final assembly took place at the Cannes Mandelieu Space Center. == The satellite == Animation of Infrared Space Observatory's orbit The basic design of ISO was strongly influenced by that of its immediate predecessor. Like IRAS, ISO was composed of two major components: * Payload module, composed of a large cryostat holding the telescope and the four scientific instruments. * Service module, supports the activities of the payload module by providing electrical power, thermal control, attitude and orbit control and telecommunications. The payload module also held a conical sun shade, to prevent stray light from reaching the telescope, and two large star trackers. The latter were part of the Attitude and Orbit Control Subsystem (AOCS) which provided three-axis stabilisation of ISO with a pointing accuracy of one arc second. It consisted of Sun and Earth sensors, the before-mentioned star trackers, a quadrant star sensor on the telescope axis, gyroscopes and reaction wheels. A complementary reaction control system (RCS), using hydrazine propellant, was responsible for orbital direction and finetuning shortly after launch. The complete satellite weighed just under 2500 kg, was 5.3 m high, 3.6 m wide and measured 2.3 m in depth. The service module held all the warm electronics, the hydrazine propellant tank and provided up to 600 watts of electrical power by means of solar cells mounted on the sunpointing side of the service module-mounted sunshield. The underside of the service module sported a load-bearing, ring shaped, physical interface for the launch vehicle. The cryostat of the payload module surrounded the telescope and science instrument with a large dewar containing a toroidal tank loaded with 2268 litres of superfluid helium. Cooling by slow evaporation of the helium kept the temperature of the telescope below 3.4 K and the science instruments below 1.9 K. These very low temperatures were required for the scientific instruments to be sensitive enough to detect the small amount of infrared radiation from cosmic sources. Without this extreme cooling, the telescope and instruments would see only their own intense infrared emissions rather than the faint ones from afar. == Optical telescope == The ISO telescope was mounted on the center line of the dewar, near the bottom-side of the torodial helium tank. It was of the Ritchey-Chr√©tien type with an effective entrance pupil of 60 cm, a focal length ratio of 15 and a resulting focal length of 900 cm. Very strict control over straylight, particularly that from bright infrared sources outside the telescope's field of view, was necessary to ensure the guaranteed sensitivity of the scientific instruments. A combination of light-tight shields, baffles inside the telescope and the sunshade on top of the cryostat accomplished full protection against straylight. Furthermore, ISO was constrained from observing too close to the Sun, Earth and Moon; all major sources of infrared radiation. ISO always pointed between 60 and 120 degrees away from the Sun and it never pointed closer than 77 degrees to Earth, 24 degrees to the Moon or closer than 7 degrees to Jupiter. These restrictions meant that at any given time only about 15 percent of the sky was available to ISO. A pyramid-shaped mirror behind the primary mirror of the telescope distributed the infrared light to the four instruments, providing each of them with a 3 arc-minute section of the 20 arc- minute field of view of the telescope. Thus, pointing of a different instrument to the same cosmic object meant repointing the entire ISO satellite. Flight spare for the LWS instrument in ISO == Instruments == ISO carried an array of four scientific instruments for observations in the infrared: * Infrared Camera (ISOCAM) ‚Äì A high-resolution camera covering 2.5 to 17 micrometre wavelength with two different detectors. Like a visible-light camera it takes pictures of astronomical objects, but the image shows what the object looks like in infrared light. * Photo-polarimeter (ISOPHOT) ‚Äì An instrument designed to measure the amount of infrared radiation emitted from an astronomical object. The very broad wavelength range from 2.4 to 240 micrometre allowed this instrument to see the infrared emissions of even the coldest astronomical objects such as interstellar dust clouds * Short Wave Spectrometer (SWS) ‚Äì A spectrometer covering the 2.4 to 45 micrometre wavelength. Observations with this instrument provided valuable information about the chemical composition, density and temperature of the universe. * Long Wave Spectrometer (LWS) ‚Äì A Spectrometer covering the 45 to 196.8 micrometre wavelength. This instrument did essentially the same as the SWS, but looked at much cooler objects than the SWS did. Particularly cold dust clouds between stars were studied with this instrument. All four instruments were mounted directly behind the primary mirror of the telescope, in a circular arrangement, with each instrument taking up an 80 degree segment of the cylindrical space. The field of view for each instrument was offset to the central axis of the telescope's field of view. This means that every instrument 'saw' a different portion of the sky at a given moment. In standard operational mode one instrument was in primary operation. == Launch and operations == After a very successful development and integration phase ISO was finally launched into orbit on November 17, 1995 on board an Ariane-44P launch vehicle. Performance of the launch vehicle was very good with the apogee only 43 km lower than expected. ESA's Space Operations Centre in Darmstadt in Germany had full control over ISO in the first four days of flight. After early commissioning primary control over ISO was handed over to the Spacecraft Control Centre (SCC) at Villafranca in Spain (VILSPA) for the remainder of the mission. In the first three weeks after launch the orbit was fine-tuned and all satellite systems were activated and tested. Cool-down of the cryostat proved to be more efficient than previously calculated, so the anticipated mission length was extended to 24 months. Between November 21 and November 26 all four science instruments were switched on and thoroughly checked out. Between December 9, 1995 and February 3, 1996 the 'Performance Verification Phase' took place, dedicated to commissioning all instruments and fixing problems. Routine observations started from February 4, 1996 and lasted until the last helium coolant depleted on April 8, 1998. The perigee of ISO's orbit lay well inside the Van Allen radiation belt, forcing the science instruments to be shut down for seven hours during each pass through the radiation belt. Thus, 17 hours in each orbit remained for scientific observation. A typical 24-hour orbit of ISO can be broken down into six phases: * Acquisition-of-Signal (AOS) by the primary Mission Control Center VILSPA in Spain and activation of the satellite. * Science operations during the VILSPA window, starting four hours after perigee, and lasting for up to nine hours. * Handover of operations to the secondary mission control center at Goldstone at apogee. During this 15 minute periode the science instruments could not be operated. * Science operations during the Goldstone window, lasting up to eight hours. * De-activation of the instruments upon approach of the Van Allen radiation belt and Loss-of-Signal (LOS) at Goldstone. * Perigee passage. Contrary to IRAS, no science data was recorded on-board ISO for later transmission to the ground. All data, both science data and housekeeping data were transmitted to the ground in real-time. The perigee point of ISO's orbit was below the radio horizon of the mission control centers at both VILSPA and Goldstone, thus forcing the science instruments to be switched off at perigee. == End of mission == At 07:00 UTC on April 8, 1998 flight controllers at VILSPA noticed a rise in temperature of the telescope. This was a clear sign that the load of superfluid helium coolant had depleted. At 23:07 UTC the same day, the temperature of the science instruments had risen above 4.2 K and science observations were ceased. A few detectors in the SWS instrument were capable of making observations at higher temperatures and remained in use for another 150 hours to make detailed measurements of an additional 300 stars. In the month following depletion of coolant the 'Technology Test Phase' (TTP) was initiated to test several elements of the satellite in off-nominal conditions. After completion of TTP, the perigee of ISO's orbit was lowered sufficiently enough to ensure ISO will burn up in Earth's atmosphere in 20 to 30 years after shutdown. ISO was then permanently switched off on May 16, 1998, at 12:00 UTC. == Results == On average, ISO performed 45 observations in each 24-hour orbit. Throughout its lifetime of over 900 orbits ISO performed more than 26,000 successful scientific observations. The huge amounts of scientific data generated by ISO was subject to extensive archiving activities up to 2006. The full data-set has been available to the scientific community since 1998 and many discoveries have been made, with probably many more still to come: * ISO detected the presence of water vapour in starforming regions, in the vicinity of stars at the end of their lives, in sources very close to the galactic centre, in the atmospheres of planets in the Solar System and in the Orion Nebula. * Planet formation was detected around old, dying stars. This discovery contradicted theories that planet formation was only possible around young stars. * Hydrogen fluoride gas was for the first time detected in interstellar gas clouds. * The first ever detection of the earliest stages of stellar formation. The pre-stellar core L1689B was found and studied in great detail with ISO's LWS instrument. * ISO discovered large amounts of cosmic dust in the previously thought empty space between galaxies. * Observations of the most-luminous object in the universe, Arp 220, revealed that the source for its enormous emission of infrared radiation is an outburst of star formation. * Observations with the LWS instrument confirmed the previous discovery by IRAS of large cloud-like structures of very cold hydrocarbons radiating primarily in the infrared. These infrared cirrus clouds affect the energy balance of the entire universe, acting as a kind of galactic refrigerator. * ISO searched for, and found several protoplanetary disks: rings or disks of material around stars which are considered to be the first stage of planet formation. * ISO pointed its sensitive instruments on several of the planets in the Solar System to determine the chemical composition of their atmospheres. == See also == * Infrared Array Camera (Spitzer near to mid infrared camera) * List of largest infrared telescopes * Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS, Hubble near-infrared instrument installed in 1997) == References == == External links == * The ISO handbook, volume 1, ISO - Mission and satellite overview * ISO ‚Äì all the facts * ISO ‚Äì mission summary * ISO spacecraft details at ESA science website * ISO telescope details at ESA science website * ISOCAM details at ESA science website * ISOPHOT details at ESA science website * ISO SWS details at ESA science website * ISO LWS details at ESA science website * ISO launch and orbit details at ESA science website * The ISO Data Centre, with an overview about the project and a gallery of pictures Category:Spacecraft launched in 1995 Category:Satellites orbiting Earth Category:European Space Agency satellites Category:Infrared telescopes Category:Space telescopes ","title":"Infrared Space Observatory"},{"id":"526220","text":"1000 Blank White Cards is a party game played with cards in which the deck is created as part of the game. Though it has been played by adults in organized groups worldwide, 1000 Blank White Cards is also described as well-suited for children in Hoyle's Rules of Games.Hoyle's Rules of Games, Third Revised and Updated Edition, in material revised by Philip D. Morehead. Penguin Putnam Inc., New York, USA, 2001. . pp. 236‚Äì7. Since any game rules are contained on the cards (rather than existing as all-encompassing rules or in a rule book), 1000 Blank White Cards can be considered a sort of nomic. It can be played by any number of players and provides the opportunity for card creation and gameplay outside the scope of a single sitting. Creating new cards during the game, dealing with previous cards' effects, is allowed, and rule modification is encouraged as an integral part of gameplay. ==Game== The game consists of whatever the players define it as by creating and playing cards. There are no initial rules, and while there may be conventions among certain groups of players, it is in the spirit of the game to spite and denounce these conventions, as well as to adhere to them religiously. For many typical players, though, the game may be split into three logical parts: the deck creation, the play itself, and the epilogue. ===Deck creation=== A deck of cards consists of any number of cards, generally of a uniform size and of rigid enough paper stock that they may be reused. Some may bear artwork, writing or other game-relevant content created during past games, with a reasonable stock of cards that are blank at the start of gameplay. Some time may be taken to create cards before gameplay commences, although card creation may be more dynamic if no advance preparation is made, and it is suggested that the game be simply sprung upon a group of players, who may or may not have any idea what they are being caught up in. If the game has been played before, all past cards can be used in gameplay unless the game specifies otherwise, but perhaps not until the game has allowed them into play. A typical group's conventions for deck creation follow: > Though cards are created at all times throughout the game (except the > epilogue), it is necessary to start with at least some cards pre-made. > Despite the name of the game, a deck of 80 to 150 cards is usual, depending > on the desired duration of the game, and of these approximately half will be > created before the start of play. If a group doesn't already possess a > partial deck they may choose to start with fewer cards and to create most of > the deck during play. > Whether or not the group possesses a deck already (from previous games), > they will usually want to add a few more cards, so the first phase of the > game involves each player creating six or seven new cards to add to the > deck. See structure of a card below. > When the deck is ready, all of the cards (including blanks) are shuffled > together and each player is dealt five cards. The remainder of the deck is > placed in the centre of the table. ===Play=== The rules of game are determined as the game is played. There exists no fixed order of play or limit to the length or scope of the game. Such parameters may be set within the game but are of course subject to alteration. One sample convention suggests the following: > Play proceeds clockwise beginning with the player on the dealer's left. On > each player's turn, he/she draws a card from the central deck and then plays > a card from his/her hand. Cards can be played to any player (including the > person playing the card), or to the table (so that it affects everyone). > Cards with lasting effects, such as awarding points or changing the game's > rules, are kept on the table to remind players of those effects. Cards with > no lasting effects, or cards that have been nullified, are placed in a > discard pile. > Blank cards can be made into playable cards at any time simply by drawing on > them (see structure of a card). > Play continues until there are no cards left in the central deck and no one > can play (if they have no cards that can be played in the current > situation). The \\"winner\\" is the player with the highest score of total > points at the end of the game, though in some games points don't actually > matter. ===Epilogue=== Since the cards created in any game may be used as the beginning of a deck for a future game, many players like to reduce the deck to a collection of their favourites. The epilogue is simply an opportunity for the players to collectively decide which cards to keep and which to discard (or set aside as not-for-play). Many players believe that having their own cards favoured during the epilogue is the true \\"victory\\" of 1000 Blank White Cards, although the game's creator has never discarded or destroyed a card unless that action was specified within the scope of the game. Retaining and replaying those cards which seem at the moment less than perfect can help reduce a certain stagnation and tendency to over-think that can otherwise overtake the game's momentum. One group of players in Boston (not the long- dispersed Harvard cadre) have introduced the idea of the \\"Suck Box\\": > We don't like to destroy cards, even if they suck, so we have a notecard box > called The Suck Box. If a player feels a card is boring and useless to > gameplay, they will nominate it for admission to The Suck Box. All players > present then vote (sometimes lobbying for their cases), and the card either > goes into The Suck Box or gets to remain in the primary deck. Ironically, > when The Suck Box was introduced, one player created a card for the express > purpose of adding it to The Suck Box. However, the rest of us felt that it > was too amusing a card and had to remain in the deck.Bob: 1KBWC in Boston ==Structure of a card== At its simplest, a card is just that: a physical card, which may or may not have undergone any modifications. Its role in the game is both as itself and as whatever information it carries, which can be changed, erased or amended. The cards used vary widely in size, from the original x Vis-Ed brand flash cards, to half or full index cards, to simply sheets of A7 sized paper. Cards may be created with any marking medium and need not conform to any conventions of size or content unless specified within the scope of the game. Cards have been made of a wide range of substances, and modifying the shape or composition of a card is entirely acceptable: the original Vis-Ed box still contains a card, created by Plan 9 From Bell Labs developer Mycroftiv, to which a tablet of zinc has been affixed with adhesive tape; the card reads \\"Eat This!... In a few minutes, the ZINC will be entering your system.\\" Many cards have been created which demanded their own modification, destruction or duplication, and many have been created which display nothing but a picture or text bearing no explicit significance whatsoever. Some have been eaten, burned, or cut and folded into other shapes. The game does tend to fall into structural conventions, of which the following is a good example: > A card consists (usually) of a title, a picture and a description of its > effect. The title should uniquely identify the card. The picture can be as > simple as a stick figure, or as complex as the player likes. The > description, or rule, is the part that affects the game. It can award or > deny points, cause a player to miss a turn, change the direction of play, or > do anything the player can think of. The rules written on cards in play make > up the majority of the game's total ruleset. In practice, these conventions can generate rather monotonous decks of one panel cartoons bearing point values, rules or both. As conceived, the game is far broader, as it is not inherently limited in length or scope, is radically self-modifying, and can contain references to, or actual instances of, other games or activities. The game can also encode algorithms (trivially functioning as a Turing machine), store real-world data, and hold or refer to non-card objects. ==History== The game was originally created late in 1995 by Nathan McQuillen of Madison, Wisconsin. He was inspired by seeing a product at a local coffeehouse: a box of 1000 Vis-Ed brand blank white flash cards. He introduced \\"The game of 1000 blank white cards\\" a few days later into a mixed group including students, improvisational theatre members and club kids. Initial play sessions were frequent and high energy, but a fire consumed the regular venue shortly after the game's introduction.Meg Jones, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Monday, February 19, 1996, p. 5B The game physically survived but with the loss of their regular meeting place the majority of the original players fell out of contact with one another, and soon most had moved on to other cities. The game started to spread as a meme through various social networks, mostly collegiate, in the late 1990s. Aaron Mandel, a former Madison resident, brought the game to Harvard University and started an active playgroup which changed the size of the cards to the more standard half-index dimensions (). Boston players Dave Packer and Stewart King created the first web content representing the game. Their graduation served to further spread the game to the west coast and onto the web. Subsequently, an article in GAMES Magazine and inclusion in the 2001 revision of Hoyle's Rules of Games established the game as an independent part of gaming culture. Various celebrities have also contributed cards to the game, including musicians Ben Folds and Jonatha Brooke, and cartoonist Bill Plympton. The game's inventor and its original players have frequently expressed amusement at the spread of a game they regarded mostly as a brilliant but highly idiosyncratic bit of conceptual humor which provided them with an excuse to draw goofy cartoons. ==See also== *Calvinball *Discordianism *Dvorak (game) *Fluxx *Mao (game) *Nomic ==References== ==External links== *1000 Blank White Cards at BoardGameGeek Category:Card games introduced in 1996 Category:Party games Category:Dedicated deck card games ","title":"1000 Blank White Cards"},{"id":"526221","text":"The imperial woodpecker (Campephilus imperialis) is a species of bird, a member of the woodpecker family Picidae. The genus Campephilus is essentially a tropical one, embracing 13 species, including the imperial woodpecker. If it is not extinct, it is the world's largest woodpecker species, at long. Researchers have discovered that the imperial woodpecker has slow climbing strides and a fast wing-flap rate compared with other woodpeckers. Owing to its close taxonomic relationship, and its similarity in appearance, to the ivory-billed woodpecker, it is sometimes called the Mexican ivory-billed woodpecker, but this name is also used for the extant pale-billed woodpecker (Campephilus guatemalensis). The large and conspicuous bird has long been known to the native inhabitants of Mexico and was called cuauhtotomomi in Nahuatl, uagam by the Tepehu√°n, and cumec√≥cari by the Tarahumara. ==Description and ecology== Turnaround video of a male study skin RMNH.AVES.110098, Naturalis Biodiversity Center The imperial woodpecker's typical size ranges from . The male imperial woodpecker has a red-sided crest, centered black, but otherwise mostly black, with large white wing-patch, thin white ‚Äúbraces‚Äù on its mantle and a huge ivory-colored bill. They are all black except for the inner primaries, which are white-tipped, the white secondaries, and a white scapular stripe which, unlike the ivory-billed woodpecker, does not extend onto the neck. The female is similar, but her crest is all black and (unlike the female ivorybill) recurved at the top, lacking any red. Much larger than any other sympatric woodpecker, it is the only woodpecker in the area with solid black underparts. Its voice is reportedly toy trumpet-like. The bird was once widespread and, until the early 1950s, not uncommon throughout the Sierra Madre Occidental of Mexico, from western Sonora and Chihuahua southwards to Jalisco and Michoac√°n. It is likely that, in the past, the woodpecker's range followed the Sierra Madre north into Arizona, but by the time it was scientifically described in the 19th century, it was already confined to Mexico. The imperial woodpecker prefers open montane forests made up of Durango, Mexican white, loblolly and Montezuma pines, as well as oak, usually between above sea level. Most records are from elevations of , but there are records as low as . It feeds mainly within bark scaled from dead pine trees and feeding on the insect larvae found underneath. There are many reports of more than four individuals, and this grouping behaviour may be related to its foraging specialisation. Breeding has been recorded between February and June, and probably 1 - 4 eggs are laid. A mated pair requires a very large area of untouched mature forest to survive, approximately ; outside the breeding season, the birds are reported to form small groups of up to 12 individuals and move about a wide area, apparently in response to the availability of food. The main food source, beetle larvae in snags, is probably distributed in patches and peaks within a short period of time. Consequently, feeding sites are probably best exploited by \\"nomadic\\" groups. If operating in groups of seven or eight individuals, the minimum area of old- growth forest for a group is 98 km2. The Cornell Lab of Ornithology has released a film of the woodpecker, recorded in Mexico in 1956. ==Decline and probable extinction== Adult male (front) and adult female (back) The imperial woodpecker is officially listed as \\"critically endangered (possibly extinct)\\" by the IUCN and BirdLife International. It was not historically a rare species within a suitable habitat, but the total population probably never numbered more than 8,000 individuals (Lammertink et al. 1996). Any remaining population is assumed to be tiny (numbering fewer than 50 mature individuals) based on the lack of confirmed records since 1956; analyses of remaining habitats indicate that no tracts remain which are large enough to support the species.The last confirmed record was from Durango in 1956, and the species is very likely now extinct. If they have gone extinct, it would have been due to habitat destruction and fragmentation combined with hunting. These factors are the reason why the species has not been seen in over 60 years, although there have been local reports of sightings. Researchers believe that their decline was also accelerated by active eradication campaigns conducted by logging interests, by over-hunting ‚Äî for use in folk medicine, and because nestlings were considered a delicacy by the Tarahumara. It has been hunted for sport, food and for medicinal purposes over a long period of time, and feathers and bills were reportedly used in rituals by Tepheuana and Huichol tribes in the south of Durango. Additionally, imperial woodpeckers are stunning birds, and as the species became increasingly rare, many were apparently shot by people who had never encountered such a bird, and wanted to get a closer look.Tim Gallagher (2013): Imperial Dreams: Tracking the Imperial Woodpecker Through the Wild Sierra Madre, pp. 224-26. New York: Atria Books. . Museum f√ºr Naturkunde, Berlin; note hand for size comparison The habitat in which the imperial woodpecker was located was predominantly in coniferous forests (terrain levels at 2,700-2,900 m. elevation). The area in which they lived was abundant with large dead trees which could be linked to their extinction. The area had been cleared and logged multiple times by 2010. Increasing effort in conservation biology is being devoted to the analysis of the extinction risk as well as the search for the rare, long unseen, species. There are a handful of more recent, unconfirmed sightings, the most recent of which closely followed the 2005 publication of the purported rediscovery of the ivory-billed woodpecker. Lammertink et al. (1996), after extensively reviewing post-1956 reports, conclude that the species did indeed survive into the 1990s in the central part of its range, but also consider a continued survival very unlikely. According to them, the population was always restricted in historic times, although the species was indeed present in maximum density before a catastrophic decline during the 1950s. The lack of good records from that time is apparently based more on lack of research than on actual rarity, but this seems to have changed radically only one decade later. Field research by Tim Gallagher and Martjan Lammertink, reported in Gallagher's 2013 book, found evidence ‚Äî in the form of accounts by elderly residents in the bird's range, who saw imperial woodpeckers decades earlier, and who discussed their recollections with the researchers ‚Äî that foresters working with Mexican logging companies in the 1950s told the local people that the woodpeckers were destroying valuable timber, and encouraged the people to kill the birds. As part of this campaign, the foresters gave the local residents poison to smear on trees that the birds foraged on. Because groups of imperial woodpeckers tended to feed on a single huge, dead, old-growth pine tree for as long as two weeks, applying poison to such a tree would be an effective way to wipe out a group of up to a dozen of these huge woodpeckers ‚Äî and, perhaps, even to kill off succeeding groups of the birds that might move into the area, and be attracted to the same tree. Gallagher suspects that such a campaign of poisoning may be the key to the species' apparent catastrophic population crash in the 1950s, which has hitherto lacked a satisfactory explanation. A campaign of poisoning could well have killed whole groups of the bird in a short time. The premise of protecting valuable timber from the woodpeckers was, in fact, baseless. Imperial woodpeckers do not forage on, or excavate nest or roosting holes in live, healthy trees.Gallagher: Imperial Dreams, pp. 224-26.Gallagher: Imperial Dreams, pp. 46, 54, 95, 139, 151, 225, 232. In Gallagher's novel The Grail Bird (2006), he discusses how difficult the search is for the imperial woodpecker due to its dangerous location. In Mexico's Sierra Madre Occidental, there are major marijuana and opium poppy-growing regions that are patrolled by armed guards. The drug cartels often kill anyone who comes too close to their crops. The imperial woodpecker is known from about 160 museum specimens and a single amateur film from 1956 depicting one bird climbing, foraging and flying. The film has been restored and released by Cornell University. Gallagher's inspiration to search for the imperial woodpecker was the discovery of this 1956 film by dentist William Rhein, who made several trips to Mexico in search of the imperial woodpecker. This is the only known photographic record of the species.Gallagher: Imperial Dreams, pp. 225-26. ==See also== *Ivory-billed woodpecker ==References== ==Further reading== * Casillas-Orona, Federico Moctezuma (2005): \\"The Imperial Woodpecker, Campephilus imperialis\\" (Gould, 1832).

The market sells a wide range of foods and goods but is best known for its African and Caribbean produce, which reflect the diverse community of Brixton and surrounding areas of Lambeth. The Street Market is managed by the London Borough of Lambeth. The covered arcades have always been in private ownership, although substantial public funding was provided for their refurbishment under the Brixton Challenge grant scheme. ==History== The Market began on Atlantic Road in the 1870s and subsequently spread to Brixton Road which had a very wide footway. Brixton then was a rapidly expanding London railway suburb with newly opening shops, including the first London branch of David Greig at 54-58 Atlantic Road in 1870, and London's first purpose-built department store, Bon March√©, on Brixton Road in 1877. The market was a popular attraction, with shoppers being entertained by street musicians. Electric Avenue which is now part of the street market was built in the 1880s and was one of the first streets to have electric light. Glazed iron canopies covered the footpath, but these were significantly damaged by WW2 bombs, and finally removed in the 1980s. The song \\"Electric Avenue\\" was written by Eddy Grant referring to this area of the market. In 2016, Electric Avenue was refurbished with funding from the Mayor of London's High Street Fund, Lambeth Council, Transport for London and the Heritage Lottery fund to include an illuminated sign celebrating the area's history. ==The covered market arcades== Arcade The market arcades were built in the 1920s and 1930s when road widening on Brixton Road forced traders from their established pitches. Reliance Arcade, 455 Brixton Road (c1924) provides a narrow pedestrian route from Brixton Road to Electric Lane. It incorporates the original Georgian house and has a beautiful Egyptian tomb facade to Electric Lane; it was extended forward by Ernest J Thomas in 1931. Inside there are small shops no larger than market stalls and a glazed roof provide the light. Reliance Arcade is Grade II listed, and was added to English Heritage's Heritage At Risk Register in October 2014. Market Row, 40 - 44 Atlantic Road was designed by Andrews and Peascod in 1928. It was built in the back yards of existing premises and links Atlantic Road, Coldharbour Lane and Electric Lane. The interior is double-height and windows in the roof provide light. Brixton Village, Coldharbour Lane was built as Granville Arcade in 1937 to designs of Alfred and Vincent Burr; the developer was Philip Granville-Grossman. It was opened by actor Carl Brisson on 6 May 1937. It has an interior of narrow covered streets called 'Avenues', and is double-height, similar to Market Row. There are over 100 shops. It links Coldharbour Lane, Atlantic Road and Popes Road. The three market arcades in close proximity, forming an extensive network of stalls, are rare survivals and their special character is what marks out Brixton as distinctive from other suburban shopping centres: a mixture of history, interesting architecture, the variety of goods on sale and the cultural mix of Brixton, known as the symbolic 'soul of black Britain'. Since 2011, the shops in Brixton Village and, more recently, Market Row and Reliance Arcade have increasingly converted into cafes and restaurants, serving a wide range of different cuisines. As a result, they are now open 8am ‚Äì 11.30pm every day except Monday, when they shut at 6pm. ===Proposed redevelopment of covered market arcades (2008/2009)=== In 2007, Market Row and Brixton Village were sold along with the other London market interests of APL Ocean Ltd to London & Associated Properties. In 2008, the new owners released proposals to redevelop the Brixton Village covered market. The proposal included the removal of the existing building and the building of a 10-story privately owned residential tower block and private park, above a new market building. In January 2009, London and Associated Properties employed communications company Four Communications to undertake a survey of local opinion. Concerns were raised on the Brixton Community website Urban 75 that the survey was one sided, only available in English. Friends of Brixton Market, traders and residents ran a successful campaign against the proposals.Friends of Brixton Market campaign to save Brixton Village Paul Bakalite's proposal for Listing was strongly supported by the Twentieth Century Society. In April 2010 the Secretary of State of the Department of Culture (DCMS) announced that the government had overturned its previous decision not award heritage protection to these three arcades and declared all three Grade II listed buildings. They were listed by virtue of their cultural importance and contribution to the social and economic history of Brixton, particularly since the 1950s as one of the principal hearts of the Afro- Caribbean community in London, as well as for their architectural importance since such arcades, once more common, are now rare. === Controversial redevelopment plans for Brixton Arches (2016/2017) === In 2015, Network Rail contacted the merchants trading from the commercial premises located under the railway arches on Atlantic Road indicating plans to close those premises for a year for refurbishment as part of the Brixton Central masterplan for redevelopment of the area. This led to public outcry from traders, many of whom had been occupying their retail space for decades, claiming that this closure was an excuse to hike the rent as they would be able to come back to occupy the same space, but with a 350% increase to their rent. The traders and community launched the Save Brixton Arches campaign, which fed into the anti- gentrification movement already underway within the Brixton community and culminated in a protest at the local council meeting where community activists declared the \\"death of Brixton\\" after the plans were approved. In 2017, the majority of the arches traders ceased trading and hoardings were installed over the empty premises, but development has stalled due to complications involving the leases of two of the arches tenants. ===Individuals=== *David Copeland *Eddy Grant *Sir John Major ===Market Roads in Brixton === *Pope's Road *Electric Avenue * Brixton Station Road ==See also== *New Covent Garden Market *Brixton railway station == References == ==External links== *Brixton Market website.

It was also known as the X-ray Explorer Satellite, SAS-A (for \\"Small Astronomy Satellite\\" A, being first of the three-spacecraft SAS series), SAS 1, or Explorer 42. The observatory was launched on December 12, 1970 into an initial orbit of about 560 km apogee, 520 km perigee, 3 degrees inclination, with a period of 96 minutes. The mission ended in March 1973. Uhuru was a scanning mission, with a spin period of ~12 minutes. It performed the first comprehensive survey of the entire sky for X-ray sources, with a sensitivity of about 0.001 times the intensity of the Crab nebula. ==Objectives== The main objectives of the mission were: HEASARC \\"The Uhuru Satellite\\" * To survey the sky for cosmic X-ray sources in the 2‚Äì20 keV range to a limiting sensitivity of 1.5 √ó 10‚àí18 joule/(cm2-sec), 5 √ó 10‚àí4 the flux from the Crab Nebula * To determine discrete source locations with a precision of a few square minutes of arc for strong sources and a few tenths of a square degree at the sensitivity limit * To study the structure of extended sources or complex regions with a resolution of about 30 arc minutes * To determine gross spectral features and variability of X-ray sources * To perform, wherever possible, coordinated and/or simultaneous observations of X-ray objects with other observers. ==Instrumentation== The payload consisted of two sets of proportional counters, each with ~0.084 m2 effective area. The counters were sensitive with more than 10% efficiency to X-ray photons in the ~2‚Äì20 keV range. The lower energy limit was determined by the attenuation of the beryllium windows of the counter plus a thin thermal shroud that was needed to maintain temperature stability of the spacecraft. The upper energy limit was determined by the transmission properties of the counter filling gas. Pulse-shape discrimination and anticoincidence techniques were used to filter out emissions of particles and undesirable high-energy photons in the background. Pulse-height analysis in eight energy channels was used to obtain information on the energy spectrum of the incident photons. The two sets of counters were placed back to back and were collimated to 0.52¬∞ √ó 0.52¬∞ and 5.2¬∞ √ó 5.2¬∞ (full width at half maximum) respectively. While the 0.52¬∞ detector gave finer angular resolution, the 5.2¬∞ detector had higher sensitivity for isolated sources. ==Results== Uhuru achieved several outstanding scientific advances, including the discovery and detailed study of the pulsing accretion-powered binary X-Ray sources such as Cen X-3, Vela X-1, and Her X-1, the identification of Cygnus X-1, the first strong candidate for an astrophysical black hole, and many important extragalactic sources. The Uhuru Catalog, issued in four successive versions, the last being the 4U catalog, was the first comprehensive X-ray catalog, contains 339 objects and covers the whole sky in the 2‚Äì6 keV band.Forman et al.

Morning twilight: astronomical, nautical and civil stages at dawn. The apparent disk of the Sun is shown to scale. Evening twilight: civil, nautical, and astronomical stages at dusk. The solar disk is shown to scale. Skyline of Taipei, Taiwan during twilight Midtown Manhattan during civil twilight, demonstrating blue hour Twilight on Earth is the illumination of the lower atmosphere when the Sun is not directly visible because it is below the horizon. Twilight is produced by sunlight scattering in the upper atmosphere, illuminating the lower atmosphere so that Earth's surface is neither completely lit nor completely dark. The word twilight is also used to denote the periods of time when this illumination occurs. The lower the Sun is beneath the horizon, the dimmer the twilight (other factors such as atmospheric conditions being equal). When the Sun reaches 18¬∞ below the horizon, the twilight's brightness is nearly zero, and evening twilight becomes nighttime. When the Sun again reaches 18¬∞ below the horizon, nighttime becomes morning twilight. Owing to its distinctive quality, primarily the absence of shadows and the appearance of objects silhouetted against the lit sky, twilight has long been popular with photographers, who sometimes refer to it as \\"sweet light\\", and painters, who often refer to it as the blue hour, after the French expression l'heure bleue. Twilight should not be confused with auroras, which can have a similar appearance in the night sky at high latitudes. By analogy with evening twilight, the word twilight is also sometimes used metaphorically, to imply that something is losing strength and approaching its end. For example, very old people may be said to be \\"in the twilight of their lives\\". The collateral adjective for twilight is crepuscular, which may be used to describe the behavior of animals that are most active during this period. ==Definitions by geometry== Twilight is defined according to the solar elevation angle Œ∏s, which is the position of the geometric center of the sun relative to the horizon. There are three established and widely accepted subcategories of twilight: civil twilight (nearest the horizon), nautical twilight, and astronomical twilight (farthest from the horizon). ==Definitions and illustrations by illumination== Civil twilight in a small town in the Mojave Desert Long exposure of nautical twilight in a small town in the Mojave Desert Long exposure of astronomical twilight (dusk) in a small town in the Mojave Desert Three subcategories of twilight are established and widely accepted: civil twilight (brightest), nautical twilight, and astronomical twilight (darkest). ==Civil twilight== Civil twilight is the period when enough natural light remains that artificial light is not needed. Morning civil twilight begins when the geometric center of the sun is 6¬∞ below the horizonftp://ftp.flaterco.com/xtide/Bowditch.pdf#238 The American Practical Navigator, 2002; page 238 and ends at sunrise. Evening civil twilight begins at sunset and ends when the geometric center of the sun reaches 6¬∞ below the horizon. In the United States' military, the initialisms BMCT (begin morning civil twilight, i.e. civil dawn) and EECT (end evening civil twilight, i.e. civil dusk) are used to refer to the start of morning civil twilight and the end of evening civil twilight, respectively. Civil dawn is preceded by morning nautical twilight and civil dusk is followed by evening nautical twilight. Under clear weather conditions, civil twilight approximates the limit at which solar illumination suffices for the human eye to clearly distinguish terrestrial objects. Enough illumination renders artificial sources unnecessary for most outdoor activities. At civil dawn and at civil dusk sunlight clearly defines the horizon while the brightest stars and planets can appear. As observed from the Earth (see apparent magnitude), sky-gazers know Venus, the brightest planet, as the \\"morning star\\" or \\"evening star\\" because they can see it during civil twilight. Lawmakers have enshrined the concept of civil twilight. Such statutes typically use a fixed period after sunset or before sunrise (most commonly 20‚Äì30 minutes), rather than how many degrees the sun is below the horizon. Examples include the following periods: when drivers of automobiles must turn on their headlights (called lighting-up time in the UK); when hunting is restricted; when the crime of burglary is to be treated as nighttime burglary, which carries stiffer penalties in some jurisdictions. The period may affect when extra equipment, such as anti-collision lights, is required for aircraft to operate. In the US, civil twilight for aviation is defined in Part 1.1 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FARs) as the time listed in the American Air Almanac. ==Nautical twilightDefinition=== Morning nautical twilight begins (nautical dawn) when the geometric center of the sun is 12 degrees below the horizon in the morning and ends when the geometric center of the sun is 6 degrees below the horizon in the morning. Evening nautical twilight begins when the geometric center of the sun is 6 degrees below the horizon in the evening and ends (nautical dusk) when the geometric center of the sun is 12 degrees below the horizon in the evening. ===Nautical dawn and dusk=== Nautical dawn is the moment when the geometric center of the Sun is 12 degrees below the horizon in the morning. It is preceded by morning astronomical twilight and followed by morning civil twilight. Nautical dusk is the moment when the geometric center of the Sun is 12 degrees below the horizon in the evening. It marks the beginning of evening astronomical twilight and the end of evening civil twilight. At the beginning of nautical twilight, artificial lighting must be used to see terrestrial objects clearly. Evening nautical twilight on Lake Ontario, Canada Before nautical dawn and after nautical dusk, sailors cannot navigate via the horizon at sea as they cannot clearly see the horizon. At nautical dawn and nautical dusk, the human eye finds it difficult, if not impossible, to discern traces of illumination near the sunset or sunrise point of the horizon (first light after nautical dawn but before civil dawn and nightfall after civil dusk but before nautical dusk). Sailors can take reliable star sightings of well-known stars, during the stage of nautical twilight when they can distinguish a visible horizon for reference (i.e. after astronomic dawn or before astronomic dusk). Under good atmospheric conditions with the absence of other illumination, during nautical twilight, the human eye may distinguish general outlines of ground objects but cannot participate in detailed outdoor operations.http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/RST_defs.php Rise, Set, and Twilight Definitions Nautical twilight has military considerations as well. The initialisms BMNT (begin morning nautical twilight, i.e. nautical dawn) and EENT (end evening nautical twilight, i.e. nautical dusk) are used and considered when planning military operations. A military unit may treat BMNT and EENT with heightened security, e.g. by \\"standing to\\", in which everyone assumes a defensive position. This is partially due to tactics dating back to the French and Indian War (part of the Seven Years' War of 1756‚Äì1763), when combatants on both sides would launch attacks at nautical dawn or dusk. ==Astronomical twilightAstronomical dawn and dusk=== Astronomical dawn is the moment when the geometric center of the Sun is 18 degrees below the horizon in the morning. Astronomical dusk is the moment when the geometric center of the Sun is 18 degrees below the horizon in the evening. After astronomical dusk and before astronomical dawn, the sky is not illuminated by the sun.http://msi.nga.mil/MSISiteContent/StaticFiles/NAV_PUBS/APN/Gloss-1.pdf#9 Glossary of Marine Navigationhttp://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/public/ask/2445 University of Cambridge ‚Äì Institute of Astronomy ‚Äì Ask an Astronomer [NB: questionable source as its sources refer back to Wikipedia] Definition Morning astronomical twilight begins (astronomical dawn) when the geometric center of the sun is 18¬∞ below the horizon in the morning and ends when the geometric center of the sun is 12¬∞ below the horizon in the morning. Evening astronomical twilight begins when the geometric center of the sun is 12¬∞ below the horizon in the evening and ends (astronomical dusk) when the geometric center of the sun is 18¬∞ below the horizon in the evening. In some places (away from urban light pollution, moonlight, auroras, and other sources of light), where the sky is dark enough for nearly all astronomical observations, astronomers can easily make observations of point sources such as stars both during and after astronomical twilight in the evening and both before and during astronomical twilight in the morning. However, some critical observations, such as of faint diffuse items such as nebulae and galaxies, may require observation beyond the limit of astronomical twilight. Theoretically, the faintest stars detectable by the naked eye (those of approximately the sixth magnitude) will become visible in the evening at astronomical dusk, and become invisible at astronomical dawn. Evening astronomical twilight (dusk) However, in other places, especially those with skyglow, astronomical twilight may be almost indistinguishable from night. In the evening, even when astronomical twilight has yet to end and in the morning when astronomical twilight has already begun, most casual observers would consider the entire sky fully dark. Because of light pollution, observers in some localities, generally in and near large cities, may never have the opportunity to view anything but the brightest stars, irrespective of the presence of any twilight at all, nor to experience anything close to a truly dark sky. ==Times of occurrence== World map showing limiting latitudes of each type of twilight during the solstices ===Between day and night=== Observers within 48¬∞34' of the Equator (within 50¬∞ of the Equator in May or November, within 57¬∞ of the Equator in April or October) can view twilight twice each day on every date of the year between astronomical dawn, nautical dawn, or civil dawn, and sunrise as well as between sunset and civil dusk, nautical dusk, or astronomical dusk. This also occurs for most observers at higher latitudes on many dates throughout the year, except those around the summer solstice. However, at latitudes closer than 9 degrees (between 81¬∞ and 90¬∞) to either Pole, the Sun cannot rise above the horizon nor sink more than 18 degrees below it on the same day on any date, this example of twilight cannot occur because the angular difference between solar noon and solar midnight elevates less than 18 degrees. ===Lasting from one day to the next=== At latitudes greater than 48¬∞34' North or South, on dates near the summer solstice, twilight can last from sunset to sunrise, since the Sun does not go more than 18 degrees below the horizon, so complete darkness does not occur even at solar midnight. These latitudes include many densely populated regions of the Earth, including the entire United Kingdom and other countries in northern Europe and even parts of central Europe. *Civil Twilight: between 60¬∞34' and 65¬∞44' North or South (between 62¬∞ and 67¬∞10' North or South in May or November, between 69¬∞ and 74¬∞10' North or South in April or October). In the northern hemisphere, includes the center of Iceland, Finland, Sweden, Norway, and Faroe Islands. In the southern hemisphere includes the Southern Ocean but at latitude smaller than 65¬∞44' South. All night of civil twilight is also referred to white night. *Nautical Twilight: between 54¬∞34' and 60¬∞34' North or South (between 56¬∞ and 62¬∞ North or South in May or November, between 63¬∞ and 69¬∞ North or South in April or October). In the northern hemisphere, includes the center of Russia, Canada, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Denmark. In the southern hemisphere includes the southernmost point of South America, and Ushuaia in Argentina. All night of nautical twilight does not constitute a white night. *Astronomical Twilight: between 48¬∞34' and 54¬∞34' North or South (between 50¬∞ and 56¬∞ North or South in May or November, between 57¬∞ and 63¬∞ North or South in April or October). In the northern hemisphere, includes the center of Isle of Man, United Kingdom, Belarus, Ireland, Netherlands, Poland, Germany, Belgium, Czech Republic, Luxembourg, Guernsey, Ukraine, and Slovakia. In the southern hemisphere includes the center of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, Bouvet Island, Heard Island, Falkland Islands. It also includes El Calafate and R√≠o Gallegos in Argentina, and Puerto Natales in Chile. All night of astronomical twilight does not constitute a white night. ===Between one night and the next=== In Arctic and Antarctic latitudes in wintertime, the polar night only rarely produces complete darkness for 24 hours each day. This can occur only at locations within 5.5 degrees of latitude of the Pole, and there only on dates close to the winter solstice. At all other latitudes and dates, the polar night includes a daily period of twilight, when the Sun is not far below the horizon. Around winter solstice, when the solar declination changes slowly, complete darkness lasts several weeks at the Pole itself, e.g., from May 11 to July 31 at Amundsen‚ÄìScott South Pole Station. North Pole has the experience of this from November 13 to January 29. Solar Noon at Civil Twilight during a polar night: Between 67¬∞24' and 72¬∞34' North or South. Solar Noon at Nautical Twilight during a polar night: Between 72¬∞34' and 78¬∞34' North or South. Solar Noon at Astronomical Twilight during a polar night: Between 78¬∞34' and 84¬∞34' North or South. Solar Noon at Night during a polar night: Between 84¬∞34' and 90¬∞ North or South. ===Lasting for 24 hours=== At latitudes within 9 degrees of either Pole, as the sun's angular elevation difference is less than 18 degrees, twilight can last for the entire 24 hours. This occurs for one day at latitudes near 9 degrees from the Pole and extends up to several weeks the further towards the Pole one goes. The only permanent settlement to experience this condition is Alert, Nunavut, Canada, where it occurs for a week in late February, and again in late October. ==Duration== The number of daylight hours depends on the latitude and time of year. Each pole has continuous daylight near its summer solstice. Carpet plot of sunshine at latitude 70 North Carpet plot of sunshine at latitude 50 North Carpet plot of sunshine at the equator Twilight at Paranal Observatory in Chile The duration of twilight depends on the latitude and the time of the year. The apparent travel of the sun occurs at the rate of 15 degrees per hour (360¬∞ per day), but sunrise and sunset happen typically at oblique angles to the horizon and the actual duration of any twilight period will be a function of that angle, being longer for more oblique angles. This angle of the sun's motion with respect to the horizon changes with latitude as well as the time of year (affecting the angle of the Earth's axis with respect to the sun). At Greenwich, England (51.5¬∞N), the duration of civil twilight will vary from 33 minutes to 48 minutes, depending on the time of year. At the equator, civil twilight can last as little as 24 minutes. This is true because at low latitudes the sun's apparent movement is perpendicular to the observer's horizon. But at the poles, civil twilight can be as long as 2‚Äì3 weeks. In the Arctic and Antarctic regions, twilight (if there is any) can last for several hours. There is no astronomical twilight at the poles near the winter solstice (for about 74 days at the North Pole and about 80 days at the South Pole). As one gets closer to the Arctic and Antarctic circles, the sun's disk moves toward the observer's horizon at a lower angle. The observer's earthly location will pass through the various twilight zones less directly, taking more time. Within the polar circles, twenty-four-hour daylight is encountered in summer, and in regions very close to the poles, twilight can last for weeks on the winter side of the equinoxes. Outside the polar circles, where the angular distance from the polar circle is less than the angle which defines twilight (see above), twilight can continue through local midnight near the summer solstice. The precise position of the polar circles, and the regions where twilight can continue through local midnight, varies slightly from year to year with Earth's axial tilt. The lowest latitudes at which the various twilights can continue through local midnight are approximately 60.561¬∞ (60¬∞33‚Ä≤43‚Ä≥) for civil twilight, 54.561¬∞ (54¬∞33‚Ä≤43‚Ä≥) for nautical twilight and 48.561¬∞ (48¬∞33‚Ä≤43‚Ä≥) for astronomical twilight.Herbert Glarner's website, reference 2. \\"Civil Twilight\\" \\"6¬∞\\", \\"Nautical Twilight\\" \\"12¬∞\\". \\"90¬∞-Axis(23.439¬∞)-12¬∞=54.561¬∞.

In the Southern Hemisphere, there are no major permanent settlements far enough South to experience this. * Nautical twilight from civil dusk to civil dawn: Moscow, Vitebsk, Vilnius, Riga, Tallinn, Wejherowo, Flensburg, Helsinki, Stockholm, Copenhagen, Oslo, Newcastle upon Tyne, Glasgow, Belfast, Letterkenny, Petropavl, Grande Prairie, Juneau, Ushuaia, and Puerto Williams. * Astronomical twilight from nautical dusk to nautical dawn: Hulun Buir, Erdenet, Nur-Sultan, Samara, Kiev, Minsk, Warsaw, Ko≈°ice, Paris, Dublin, Zwettl, Prague, Stanley (Falkland Islands), Berlin, Luxembourg City, Brussels, Amsterdam, London, Cardiff, Calgary, Unalaska, Bellingham (largest in the continental USA), Rio Gallegos, and Punta Arenas. * Major cities that near astronomical twilight from nautical dusk to nautical dawn: Saguenay (48¬∞25‚Ä≤0\\"N), Brest (48¬∞23‚Ä≤26\\"N), Thunder Bay (48¬∞22‚Ä≤56‚Ä≥N), Vienna (48¬∞12‚Ä≤30‚Ä≥N), Bratislava (48¬∞8‚Ä≤38‚Ä≥N), Munich (48¬∞8'0\\"N) Although Helsinki, Oslo, Stockholm, Tallinn, and Saint Petersburg also enter into nautical twilight after sunset, they do have noticeably lighter skies at night during the summer solstice than other locations mentioned in their category above, because they do not go far into nautical twilight. A white night is a night with only civil twilight which lasts from sunset to sunrise. At the winter solstice within the polar circle, twilight can extend through solar noon at latitudes below 72.561¬∞ (72¬∞33‚Ä≤43‚Ä≥) for civil twilight, 78.561¬∞ (78¬∞33‚Ä≤43‚Ä≥) for nautical twilight, and 84.561¬∞ (84¬∞33‚Ä≤43‚Ä≥) for astronomical twilight. ==On other planets== Twilight on Mars is longer than on Earth, lasting for up to two hours before sunrise or after sunset. Dust high in the atmosphere scatters light to the night side of the planet. Similar twilights are seen on Earth following major volcanic eruptions.NASA-Jet Propulsion Laboratory: Winter Solstice on Mars: Rovers Look Forward to A Second Martian Spring, August 07, 2006. ==In religion  Christianity === American Benedictine monks around an Easter fire preparing to light the Paschal candle prior to Easter Vigil mass In Christian practice, \\"vigil\\" observances often occur during twilight on the evening before major feast days or holidays. For example, the Easter Vigil is held in the hours of darkness between sunset on Holy Saturday and sunrise on Easter Day ‚Äî most commonly in the evening of Holy Saturday or midnight ‚Äî and is the first celebration of Easter, days traditionally being considered to begin at sunset. === Hinduism === Twilight is sacred in Hinduism. It is called ‡§ó‡•ã‡§ß‡•Ç‡§≥‡§ø‡§µ‡•á‡§≥ g≈çdh≈´·∏∑ivƒì·∏∑ in Marathi or ‡§ó‡•ã‡§ß‡•Ç‡§≤‡§ø‡§µ‡•á‡§≤‡§æ godh≈´livelƒÅ in Hindi, ‡∞ó‡±ä‡∞ß‡±Ç‡∞≥‡∞ø‡∞µ‡±á‡∞≥ \\"godhoolivela\\" in Telugu, literally \\"cow dust time\\". Many rituals, including Sandhyavandanam and Puja, are performed at twilight hour. Eating of food is not advised during this time. Sometimes it is referred to as Asurasandhya vela. It is believed that Asuras are active during these hours. One of the avatars of Lord Vishnu, Narasimha, is closely associated with the twilight period. According to Hindu scriptures, a daemonic king, Hiranakashipa, performed penance and obtained a boon from Brahma that he could not be killed during day or night and neither by human nor animal. Lord Vishnu appeared in a half-man half-lion form (neither human nor animal), ended the life of Hiranakashipa during twilight (neither day nor night). === Islam === Twilight is important in Islam as it determines when certain universally obligatory prayers are to be recited. Morning twilight is when morning prayers (Fajr) are done, while evening twilight is the time for evening prayers (Maghrib prayer). Suhoor (early morning meal) time for fasting (during Ramadan and other times) ends at morning twilight (at dawn). Fasting is from the beginning of dawn to sunset. There is also an important discussion in Islamic jurisprudence between \\"true dawn\\" and \\"false dawn\\". === Judaism === In Judaism, twilight is considered neither day nor night; consequently it is treated as a safeguard against encroachment upon either. For example, the twilight of Friday is reckoned as Sabbath eve, and that of Saturday as Sabbath day; and the same rule applies to festival days. ==Gallery== File:ChiangKai- shek memorial2009 amk.jpgView from the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall, at evening civil twilight, Taipei, Taiwan File:Mountain Moonset.jpgMorning twilight mountain moonset File:Rainbow Ridge.jpgMidsummer twilight over Rainbow Ridge, Landers, California.

Along with the Juan De Fuca Plate and Gorda Plate, the Explorer Plate is a remnant of the ancient Farallon Plate which has been subducted under the North American Plate. The Explorer Plate separated from the Juan De Fuca Plate roughly 4 million years ago. In its smoother, southern half, the average depth of the Explorer plate is roughly and rises up in its northern half to a highly variable basin between and in depth. == Boundaries == Bathymetric profile of Explorer Ridge region A Bathymetric Profile of the Explorer Plate Region. The eastern boundary of the Explorer Plate is being subducted under the North American Plate. The southern boundary is a collection of transform faults, the Sovanco Fracture Zone, separating the Explorer Plate from the Pacific Plate. To the southeast is another transform boundary, the Nootka Fault, which separates the Explorer Plate from the Juan de Fuca Plate and forms a triple junction with the North American Plate. To the northwest is a divergent boundary with the Pacific Plate forming the Explorer Ridge, and the Winona Basin located within the northwest boundaries and the Pacific continental shelf. The Queen Charlotte triple junction is located where the Pacific Plate and North American Plate meets with the Explorer Plate. == Formation and evolution == Upon breaking apart 4 million years ago, the Juan De Fuca Plate continued moving northeast at 26 mm/year (1 in/year) while the Explorer Plate's velocity changed, stalling or moving slowly north up to 20 mm/year. The Nootka Fault boundary between the Juan De Fuca Plate and the Explorer Plate has varied in length and direction since their separation. The formation of the Nookta Fault and the shearing of plate boundaries has caused a clockwise rotation, reorienting the Sovanco Fracture Zone northwards along the North American Plate and slowing the Explorer Plate's subduction. The Sovanco Fracture Zone originated as a spreading center offset more than 7 million years ago which shows southward movement from the influence of the Explorer ridge and results in uneven spreading eastward unto the Explorer Plate. == Current state of subduction == The subducted portion of the plate extends downward to more than 300 km (186 mi) depth, and laterally as far as mainland Canada. The relative buoyancy of the subducting plate and the underlying mantle may be inhibiting the Explorer Plate's ability to descend further into the mantle. There is an ongoing debate regarding the process of subduction of the Explorer Plate and how the boundary between the Explorer plate and the North American Plate are defined: # The Explorer Plate has stopped and may eventually accrete, fusing with the North American plate as the subduction has fully stopped and will eventually become a plate boundary between the North American Plate and Pacific Plate rather than continuing its subduction. # The Explorer Plate consists of two parts with half being fused to the North American Plate and the other half remaining a microplate system. # The Explorer Plate has slowed to a terminal speed of 20 mm/year, and will continue until the entire plate is subducted. == Seismic activity == As a part of the Pacific Ring of Fire, the Explorer Plate has a high level of seismic activity. However, the activity consists of low- magnitude events; no earthquake above magnitude 6.5 has been recorded in the region, though a swarm of several dozen magnitude 5‚Äì6 earthquakes occurred just north of the Seminole Seamount in 2008. The Explorer Plate is the most seismically active area of Canada, but is anomalous as a subduction zone since most of the seismic activity occurs around the plate's perimeter rather than at the subduction interface. Events are generally centered around the southern and north-western areas where the borders of the plate are in contact with other plates; however, the newer ocean crust created at Explorer ridge and Juan de Fuca ridge reduces the rigidity of the region and contributes to the low magnitude of events in the region. == See also == * Geology of the Pacific Northwest == References == == External links == * Cascadia tectonic history Category:Tectonic plates Category:Geology of British Columbia Category:Geology of the Pacific Ocean ","title":"Explorer Plate"},{"id":"526280","text":"The River Lune (archaically sometimes Loyne) is a river in length in Cumbria and Lancashire, England. ==Etymology== Several elucidations for the origin of the name Lune exist.

The northern part between its source and Tebay is called Lunesdale. Below this is the spectacular Lune Gorge through which both the M6 motorway and the West Coast Main Railway Line run. Below the gorge, the valley broadens out into Lonsdale. Bridges over the Lune include the Devil's Bridge near Kirkby Lonsdale and the Lune Millennium Bridge in Lancaster. At Caton, about upstream from Lancaster, there is a cluster of three bridges (one stone road bridge and two disused iron rail bridges now used as foot/cyclepaths) at the Crook o' Lune. Here in a 180-degree right-hand bend the Lune turns back on itself; this is followed by a 90-degree left-hand bend forming the shape of a shepherd's crook and creating a beauty spot which was painted by J. M. W. Turner.Crook of Lune, Looking towards Hornby Castle, Tate Collection, accessed 2009-08-15 The M6 motorway crosses the Lune near Tebay and Halton-on-Lune; in 2015 it was joined by the Heysham to M6 Link Road.

Carlisle Bridge over the Lune at Lancaster == Estuary == Near the end of the non- tidal reach of the river stands the Lune Aqueduct, which carries the Lancaster Canal. The Lune is now tidal only below Skerton Weir in Lancaster. Four bridges in close proximity cross the estuary in Lancaster: Skerton Bridge (road), Greyhound Bridge (built as rail but now carries a road), Lune Millennium Bridge (pedestrian and cycle) and Carlisle Bridge (carrying the West Coast Main Line railway, and with a public walkway on the eastern side) which is the furthest downstream of the bridges. This part of the Lune is also the site of the old Port of Lancaster, probably a port from Roman times; the Lancaster Port Commission was established in 1750 Dalziel N., The Port of Lancaster in the 18th Century, University of Lancaster - Archaeology Conference 2 March 1996 to improve navigation on the estuary. Between 1750 and 1767, St George's Quay and New Quay were built in Lancaster and in 1779 the port facilities were extended closer to the Irish Sea at Glasson Dock. In 1847 the Commissioners built a pair of lighthouses near Cockersand Abbey to help guide ships into the port. The lower lighthouse, known as the Plover Scar Lighthouse, (sometimes called Abbey lighthouse) still stands on Plover Scar, and it remains operational. The old high light, a square wooden tower, was demolished in 1954; but the former keepers' cottage, built alongside the high light, can still be seen. Lancaster (and hence also Lancashire) is named after the Lune. The name of the ancient hundred of Lonsdale is also derived from the river. The river is a County Biological Heritage Site. ==In literature== An engraving entitled 'The Vale of Lonsdale' appears in Fisher's Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1832 together with a poetical illustration by Letitia Elizabeth Landon. The plate shows Ingleborough in the background.

The majority of incidents occur below Skerton Weir in the tidal area, or around the weir itself. HM Coastguard have operational Primacy over incidents up to the high water mark, with their nearest team based in Morecambe. Flanking teams at Knott End and Arnside will often assist. Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service Fire appliance at Lancaster maintains a water rescue service, with specially trained swiftwater rescue personnel. The nearest Fire service boat is based at Preston Fire station and this is often called to assist the swiftwater rescue personnel in carrying out rescues or providing safety cover for the crews. In 2018 Lancaster Area Search and Rescue established themselves within the city. Part of the Surf Lifesaving Great Britain (SLSGB) family, their main role is to provide water rescue personnel and resources to flood and other water incidents within the Lancaster district at times when the statutory services require assistance. The team is equipped with rescue sleds and a powered inflatable boat for use on the river. The RNLI can also be seen on the river fairly regularly, including both the D class and their Hovercraft, The Hurley Flyer. Rather than transit to scene from the Lifeboat station, the RNLI will often drive to the scene, often launching at Snatchems Golden Ball pub. ==Notes== Category:Rivers of Cumbria Category:Rivers of Lancashire Category:Rivers of Lancaster River Lune ","title":"River Lune"},{"id":"526286","text":"Schlenkerla Rauchbier being tapped straight from the cask Schlenkerla is a historic brewpub in Bamberg, Franconia, Germany renowned for its smoked Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier. ==Beers== Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Weizen Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier has a distinctively smoky aroma and flavor that is consistently present amongst the three varieties: urbock, m√§rzen and weizen.

He was one of the earliest scientific explorers of the Pacific region, making significant collections of flora and fauna in Alaska, California, and Hawaii. ==Biography== Eschscholtz was born in the Livonian city of Dorpat, then part of the Russian Empire. His parents, Johann Gottfried and Katherine Hedwig Ziegler Eschscholtz were ethnic Baltic Germans. He studied medicine and zoology at the University of Dorpat and served as an assistant to Carl Friedrich von Ledebour, a professor of botany.McKelvey Eschscholtz received a medical degree in 1815. ===First voyage=== On the recommendation of Ledebour, Eschscholtz served as surgeon and naturalist on the Russian expeditionary ship Rurik under the command of Otto von Kotzebue. From 1815 to 1818 the expedition circumnavigated the globe for the purposes of seeking a Northwest Passage and exploring the lands bordering the Pacific Ocean. In addition to Eschscholtz, the scientific team included botanist Adelbert von Chamisso and artist Louis Choris.JSTOR The expedition left Kronstadt, Russia on 30 June 1815, stopping at the Canary Islands in September and then crossing the Atlantic to Santa Catarina, Brazil. They passed Cape Horn in January 1816 and sailed north for several months to reach Kamchatka in July. From there they spent the rest of 1816 visiting the Aleutian Islands, California, and Hawaii. At each stop Eschscholtz collected specimens and recorded his observations of the local flora and fauna. Eschscholtz and Chamisso worked well together and became good friends. When Kotzebue became ill in 1817, they cut short a planned return to the Arctic and headed home, stopping again in Hawaii and then in the Philippines before ending their voyage at St. Petersburg in August 1818. Kotzebue published a three-volume account of the expedition, including reports from Chamisso and Eschscholtz. Their natural history collections were described in the journals Horae physicae Berolinenses (1820), the Memoires de l'Academie Imperiale des Sciences de St. Petersbourg (1826) and Linnaea (between 1826 and 1836). Eschscholtz's botanical collections from California were published under the title Descriptiones plantarum novae Californiae, adjectis florum exoticorum analysibus (1826). This was the first scientific description of California's flora and the first reference to California in the title of a scientific paper.Beidleman (2006) He also published some of his entomological finds in Entomographien (1822). After his first voyage, Eschscholtz married Christine Friedrike Ledebour and became an assistant professor at the University of Dorpat in 1819. He was later appointed director of the university's zoological museum in 1822. ===Second voyage=== Eschscholtz's second voyage, 1823‚Äì1826. In 1823 Kotzebue was commissioned to return to the North Pacific to resupply Kamchatka and then proceed to Alaska to protect the Russian American Company from smugglers. Eschscholtz accepted an offer to participate in this second voyage and left Kronstadt on 28 July 1823 aboard the Predpriaetie (Enterprise).Gale (1998) Again Eschscholtz amassed significant collections of natural history specimens, especially insects. Substantial insect collections were made in Hawaii, Alaska, and California. After a voyage of three years, the expedition returned home in July 1826. In 1830 Kotzebue and Eschscholtz published a report of their voyage titled A new voyage round the world in the years 1823, 24, 25, and 26. Eschscholtz published illustrated descriptions of the new fauna he encountered in Zoologischer Atlas, 1829-1833; and provided further information in System der Akalephen, 1829. He also continued to work at the University of Dorpat, serving as professor of medicine and zoology and director of the zoological museum. California poppy, Eschscholzia californica Of the many insects he collected, about 100 butterflies and twenty beetles were species new to science. Eschscholtz described some of them before his death but many were described by others, including Swedish naturalist Carl Gustaf Mannerheim, French entomologist Pierre Fran√ßois Marie Auguste Dejean, and Russian entomologist Gotthelf Fischer von Waldheim. Eschscholtz died on 7 May 1831 at the age of 37. ==Legacy== His friend and colleague, Adelbert von Chamisso, named the California poppy (Eschscholzia californica) in his honor. Kotzebue named an island in the Marshall Islands as Eschscholtz Atoll. This was renamed in 1946 to Bikini Atoll. Kotzebue also named a small bay east of Kotzebue Sound after Eschscholtz. Most of his collections were left to the University of Dorpat Museum and the Imperial Museum of Moscow. ==See also== * European and American voyages of scientific exploration * List of Baltic German scientists == Notes == == References == * * Essig, E.

Gates first worked with unemployed workers in Ohio, eventually running unsuccessfully for the city council of Youngstown. ===Spanish Civil War veteran=== When the Spanish Civil War broke out, Gates joined the Abraham Lincoln Brigade and fought in Spain. In March 1938, at the age of 24, Gates rose to the rank of battalion political commissar of the Lincoln-Washington Battalion. In this capacity, Gates gained a reputation as a strict disciplinarian. He later admitted he had gone somewhat overboard. In 1938, he was involved in the controversial decision to execute a deserter named Paul White who had left the lines before having a change of heart and returning, only to be executed for disciplinary reasons. The decision caused great dissension in the Lincoln Brigade's ranks, forcing the immediate declaration that no further executions would take place.\\"John Gates\\", Spartacus International. ===Political career=== Returning to the United States from Spain, Gates became the head of the Young Communist League. The week after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, Gates enlisted in the American armed forces.\\"The Mike Wallace Interview. Guest: John Gates,\\", January 18, 1958. In the summer of 1948, Gates was one of 12 \\"kingpin Commies\\" (to borrow a colorful contemporary turn of phrase from Time magazine) indicted under the Smith Act for being \\"dedicated to the Marxist‚ÄìLeninist principles of the overthrow and destruction of the Government ... by force and violence.\\"\\"Communists: The Top Twelve,\\" Time, August 2, 1948. Although the Smith Act had been implemented eight years earlier at the time of the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact for the altogether different purpose of fighting potential infiltration of America by secret Nazi and Communist saboteurs, at the height of the Cold War the existing law was used as a tool against national officials of the Communist Party. Prosecution of the ailing 67-year- old William Z. Foster was eventually dropped, but the 11 others, Gates among them, were convicted in 1949 and sentenced to five years in prison. Following his release from prison in 1955, Gates was appointed as editor of the Communist Party's newspaper, The Daily Worker. In that capacity, Gates' editorial policy soon came to set him at odds with the Party leadership, he took liberal positions embracing Nikita Khrushchev's criticisms of Stalin and opposing the Soviet Union's suppression of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution. Party leaders were particularly upset by his support of Howard Fast, a prominent writer who was quite critical of the Soviet Union and soon after also left the Communist Party. However, The Daily Worker was in deep trouble with significant losses in circulation due to a general disenchantment with communism, by both workers and intellectuals, and pressure from McCarthyism. Confronted with deep deficits and its inability to control Gates, on December 22, 1957, the Party suspended publication of the paper as a daily, the last daily issue appearing January 13, 1958. ===Resignation=== Gates resigned from the Party in January 1958, claiming that it had \\"ceased to be an effective force for democracy, peace, and socialism in the United States.\\" He set to work writing his memoirs, The Story of an American Communist, tapping fellow ex-Communist pariah Earl Browder to write the book's introduction. In a January 18, 1958, television interview with Mike Wallace, Gates attempted to illuminate his interlocutor on the nature of the power relationship between the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the American Communist movement: > [Y]ou have to understand how and why [the CPUSA] followed [Moscow's] line. > It's not a matter that someone gave orders over there and we followed it > over here. It's much more subtle than that. We followed that line because we > thought it was right. It's more or less like a relationship between two > people. One is an aggressive, brilliant personality and the other worships > that person, and that person becomes sort of an idol for him and he tends to > imitate and ape everything that he does. Well that kind of relationship is a > bad relationship for both people.\\" Gates cited the American Communist Party's failure to declare its independence from Moscow as decisive in his decision to leave the organization. Following publication of his memoirs, Gates went to work as a senior research assistant for the International Ladies Garment Workers Union (ILGWU). In this capacity, Gates helped members with workers' compensation, unemployment, and Social Security claims. He retired from the union in 1987. ==Death== Johnny Gates died on May 23, 1992 in Miami Beach, Florida at the age of 78. He was survived by his wife of 47 years, the former Lillian Schwartz; a brother, Nat Regenstreif, of Hollywood, Florida, and three sisters, Blanche Smiles of the Bronx, Irene Travis of Charlotte, North Carolina, and Marlene Seml of Boca Raton, Florida. ==Works== * The South: The Nation's Problem.

They are distinguished by the straight-pull bolt action invented by Rudolf Schmidt and use Eduard Rubin's 7.5√ó55mm Schmidt‚ÄìRubin rifle cartridge. ==ModelsSchmidt‚ÄìRubin 1889=== Schmidt‚ÄìRubin Model 1889 rifle chambered for the GP11 7.5√ó53.5mm cartridge. The Model 1889 was the first in the series of Schmidt‚ÄìRubin rifles which served Switzerland from 1889 to 1953. The rifle takes its name from the designer of its action, Colonel Rudolf Schmidt, and the designer of its ammunition, Colonel Eduard Rubin. Production of the rifle began in 1891. The straight-pull bolt action allows the user to pull the bolt straight back to unlock the action, cock the striker, extract, and eject the spent cartridge in one motion, and then push the bolt forward to chamber a round and lock the action. This is as opposed to a traditional bolt action, wherein the user must lift the bolt handle to unlock the action before pulling the bolt back. The rifle is roughly musket length with a free-floating barrel, 12-round magazine and wood stock that extends almost to the tip of the barrel. The Schmidt‚ÄìRubin 1889 was an advanced weapon for its time. The Schmidt‚ÄìRubin 1889 was one of the first rifles to use copper-jacketed ammunition as its standard ammunition. The GP90 7.5√ó53.5mm round designed by Col. Rubin in 1882 was revolutionary in that most of the bullets used in Europe at the time, except for the Mle 1886 Lebel rifle metal-jacketed 8mm bullet, were around .45 caliber, as opposed to the .308 caliber of the Schmidt‚ÄìRubin ammunition. The round was \\"paper patched\\", meaning that the bullet was surrounded by a piece of paper, much like the cotton patches placed around a musket ball. Paper patching the round was supposed to aid in the lubrication of the bullet. In 1923, long after the discontinuation of the Model 1889, the GP90/23 7.5√ó54.5mm round was produced without the paper patching. The Model 1889 was eventually replaced by its successor models, including the Model 1896, Model 96/11, Model 1911, Model 1911 carbine, and the famous K-31. ===Schmidt-Rubin model 1889/96=== The Schmidt‚ÄìRubin Model 1889/96 was the replacement for the 1889. The biggest change was moving the locking lugs from the rear of the bolt sleeve to the front of the bolt sleeve. This allowed the receiver to be shortened by a small amount. In addition, the change allowed the bolt and receiver to handle more pressure. Colonel Schmidt was asked to do this for the model 1889, but refused, claiming it was not possible. Colonel Vogelsgang and his assistant Rebholz worked out the details which were not complex but did require time to retool. The rifle system was adopted in 1896. As such, this and subsequent versions should probably be known more as Vogelsgang-Rebholz rifles, rather than Schmidt-Rubin. When the cartridge was modified in 1911 to increase the velocity of the bullet, the 1896 bolt system was used. Almost all the model 89/96 rifles were converted to 96/11. Only a few remain in the original configuration and almost all of those are private series rifles that were never military issue. ===Schmidt-Rubin Model 1897 cadet rifle=== The Schmidt-Rubin Model 1897 cadet rifle was intended as a replacement for the earlier Vetterli rifles. The Model 97 rifles were single shot using the bolt mechanism of the Schmidt-Rubin Model 89/96 rifle. It was to use a reduced power GP90 7.5√ó53.5mm cartridge for the smaller younger cadets. The rifles sights were graduated both for the light and the standard loads. There were approximately 7900 of the cadet rifles made. ===Model 1899/1900 short rifle=== The model 1899/1900 short rifle was an answer to a call for a short rifle that would replace the unpopular Model 1893 Manlicher straight pull action Carbine. The 99/00 short rifle was meant to be used by the artillery and other rear echelon troops. Design began February 27 1900, and production began in 1901 and lasted for 10 years (18,750 were made). This short rifle was spread to: fortress troops, artillery men, bicycle troops, and balloon companies. The model 99/00 short rifle can be fitted with Model 1889/92 bayonet and the Model 1906 bayonet. Most of the 99/00 and later 1905 short rifles were converted to model K11 carbines when the GP11 cartridge was adopted. Very few unconverted rifles exist today. ===Schmidt-Rubin 1896/11 rifle=== The Schmidt‚ÄìRubin 1896/11 rifle, or the Model 96/11, was Switzerland's effort to upgrade the 89/96 rifles it had on hand to use the more powerful cartridge adopted as the GP11. The GP11 cartridge operated at a higher chamber pressure, which the 89/96 action could easily handle. Because of this, the model 89/96 rifles were modernized by changing the 3 groove rifled barrel to a new 4-groove type, adding a pistol grip to the stock, changing the magazine to the 6-round type used in the 1900 short rifle, and changing the sights to a more modern type. The changes streamlined the appearance of the rifles. Because more rifles were needed than were available, the model 1911 rifle was put into production with slight changes. Almost all of the 127,000-plus model 89/96 rifles were converted to the 96/11 specifications. ===Model 1911 rifle=== Bolt of the Model 1911 Rifle and Carbine, operating rod stripped Schmidt‚ÄìRubin Model 1911 Rifle An improvement over the original 1889 version of the Schmidt‚ÄìRubin rifle, the Swiss M1911 placed the locking lugs in the middle of the bolt, rather than at the rear, strengthening the action and allowing a more powerful cartridge, the Gewehrpatrone 11 or GP 11 to be used. It is distinguished from the 96/11 rifle by a curved buttplate and by a stock with an integral semi-pistol grip. It uses a graduated tangent sight which begins at 300 meters. The 1911 and 96/11 rifles are characterized by exceptional accuracy and were made with excellent craftsmanship. The fact that Switzerland remained neutral through both world wars ensured that they are in far better condition, on average, than the rifles of other European nations from that vintage.http://www.swissrifles.com/sr/index.html ===Model 1911 carbine (\\"K11\\") === The Swiss at some point realized that its support troops, cavalry, and certain other units required a shorter rifle than what was currently available and so designed the Model 1911 carbine. The Swiss 1911 carbine being smaller, lighter and still lethally accurate, it became a favorite of the Swiss Army and its popularity contributed to the design of its successor the K31. Production of the K11 included conversion of the model 1900 and 1905 short rifles to the newer specifications of the carbine. For this reason the earlier short rifles are rarely found in their original state. The K11 was the last of the Vogelsgang/Rebholz rifles to be produced. ===Other models=== Other models include: * K31 carbine, a significant later development * Model 1905 carbine * ZfK31/42 and /43 *Z fK55 sniper rifle == References == ==External links== * Swiss Rifles * Category:7.5√ó55mm Swiss firearms Category:Early rifles Category:Rifles of Switzerland Category:Straight-pull rifles ","title":"Schmidt‚ÄìRubin"},{"id":"526314","text":"Edmund or Etmond mac Ma√≠l Coluim (c. 1070 - after 1097) was a son of Malcolm III of Scotland and his second wife, Margaret of Wessex. He may be found on some lists of Scottish kings, but there is no evidence that he was king. Although Edmund was probably Malcolm and Margaret's second son, he was passed over in subsequent successions as a result of betraying his siblings by siding with their uncle, Donald III. On the death of Edmund's father and his heir- designate, Edward, his eldest son by Margaret, in November 1093, Edmund's uncle Donald took the throne. Edmund and his younger brothers Edgar, Alexander and David fled abroad, to England, to join their half-brother Duncan at the court of William Rufus. In 1094 Duncan, with Rufus's blessing and the support of landless nobles from the English court and landowners in Lothian, drove Donald from the throne. It is supposed that Edmund, as the next in age, was Duncan's heir-designate. Duncan was forced by a rebellion to send his English allies home, and was shortly afterwards killed. The killer was M√°el Petair, Mormaer of Mearns, but the Annals of Ulster and William of Malmesbury agree that the killing was done on the orders of Donald and Edmund. What caused Edmund to join with his uncle is unknown. It is assumed that Donald appointed him his heir as Donald had no sons of his own, and it is thought that Edmund was granted an appanage to rule. Edmund's maternal uncle Edgar √Ütheling came north in 1097, driving Donald from the throne and installing Edmund's younger brother Edgar as king, with Alexander as his heir-designate. While Donald was mutilated and imprisoned, dying in 1099, Edmund was more fortunate. He was tonsured and sent to the Cluniac monastery at Montacute in Somerset. The exact date of his death is unknown. ==References== *Duncan, A.A.M., The Kingship of the Scots 842-1292: Succession and Independence.

Paul initiated, and along with Lucy Burns and others, strategized events such as the Woman Suffrage Procession and the Silent Sentinels, which were part of the successful campaign that resulted in the amendment's passage in 1920.Baker, Jean H., \\"Placards At The White House,\\" American Heritage, Winter 2010, Volume 59, Issue 4. After 1920, Paul spent a half century as leader of the National Woman's Party, which fought for the Equal Rights Amendment, written by Paul and Crystal Eastman, to secure constitutional equality for women. She won a large degree of success with the inclusion of women as a group protected against discrimination by the Civil Rights Act of 1964 alongside legal scholar Pauli Murray. She also went to jail for protesting in front of the White House. ==Early life and education== Alice Stokes Paul was born on January 11, 1885 to banker William Mickle Paul I (1850‚Äì1902) and his wife Tacie Paul (n√©e Parry) (1859-1930) at Paulsdale, Mount Laurel Township, New Jersey.Kahn, Eve M. \\"Group Seeks to Buy a Suffragist's Home\\", The New York Times, July 13, 1989. Accessed July 12, 2008. \\"The Alice Paul Centennial Foundation plans to buy the house in Mount Laurel, but first the organization must raise $500,000 by Sept. 8.... The 2¬Ω-story, stucco-clad brick farmhouse was built in 1840 and once overlooked the Paul family's 173-acre Burlington County farm, east of Camden. Miss Paul was born in an upstairs bedroom in 1885 and lived in the house until she left for Swarthmore College in 1901.\\" She was named to honor Alice Stokes (1821-1889) who was her maternal grandmother and the wife of William Parry (1817-1888).Westfield Friends Burial Ground Her siblings were Willam Mickle Paul II (1886-1958), Helen Paul Shearer (1889-1971), and Parry Haines Paul (1895-1956). She was a descendant of William Penn, the Quaker founder of Pennsylvania. Her ancestors included participants in the New Jersey Committee of Correspondence in the Revolutionary era and a state legislative leader in the 19th century. She grew up in the Quaker tradition of public service. Alice first learned about women's suffrage from her mother, a member of the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA), and would sometimes join her mother in attending suffragist meetings. Paul and Helen Gardener, ca. 1908‚Äì1915 Paul attended Moorestown Friends School, where she graduated at the top of her class. In 1901, she went to Swarthmore College, an institution co-founded by her grandfather. While attending Swarthmore, Paul served as a member on the Executive Board of Student Government, one experience which may have sparked her eventual excitement for political activism. She graduated from Swarthmore College with a bachelor's degree in biology in 1905. Partly in order to avoid going into teaching work, Paul completed a fellowship year at a settlement house in New York City after her graduation, living on the Lower East Side at the College Settlement House. While working on settlement activities taught her about the need to right injustice in America, Paul soon decided that social work was not the way she was to achieve this goal: \\"I knew in a very short time I was never going to be a social worker, because I could see that social workers were not doing much good in the world... you couldn't change the situation by social work.\\"Alice Paul in oral history compiled by Amelia Fry, Online Archive of California, quoted in . Paul then earned a master of arts from the University of Pennsylvania in 1907, after completing coursework in political science, sociology and economics. She continued her studies at the Woodbrooke Quaker Study Centre in Birmingham, England, and took economics classes from the University of Birmingham, while continuing to earn money doing social work. She first heard Christabel Pankhurst speak at Birmingham. When she later moved to London to study sociology and economics at the London School of Economics, she joined the militant suffrage group the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) led by Christabel and her mother, Emmeline Pankhurst. Paul was arrested repeatedly during suffrage demonstrations and served three jail terms. After returning from England in 1910, she continued her studies at the University of Pennsylvania, earning a Ph.D. in sociology. Her dissertation was entitled \\"The Legal Position of Women in Pennsylvania\\"; it discussed the history of the women's movement in Pennsylvania and the rest of the U.S., and urged woman suffrage as the key issue of the day. Paul later received her law degree (LL.B) from the Washington College of Law at American University in 1922, after the suffrage fight was over. In 1927, she earned a master of laws degree, and in 1928, a doctorate in civil law from American University. ==CareerBritain=== Early work in British woman suffrage Alice Paul in 1915 In 1907, after completing her master's degree at the University of Pennsylvania, Paul moved to England, where she eventually became deeply involved with the British women's suffrage movement, regularly participating in demonstrations and marches of the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU). After a \\"conversion experience\\" seeing Christabel Pankhurst speak at the University of Birmingham, Paul became enamored of the movement. She first became involved by selling a Suffragist magazine on street corners. This was a particularly difficult task considering the animosity towards the Suffragists and opened her eyes to the abuse that women involved in the movement faced. These experiences, combined with the teachings of Professor Beatrice Webb, convinced Paul that social work and charity could not bring about the needed social changes in society: this could only be accomplished through equal legal status for women. While in London, Paul also met Lucy Burns, a fellow American activist, whilst arrested in a British police station, who would become an important ally for the duration of the suffrage fight, first in England, then in the United States. The two women quickly gained the trust of prominent WSPU members and began organizing events and campaign offices. When Emmeline Pankhurst attempted to spread the movement to Scotland, Paul and Burns accompanied her as assistants. Paul quickly gained the trust of fellow WSPU members through both her talent with visual rhetoric and her willingness to put herself in physical danger in order to increase the visibility of the suffrage movement. While at the WSPU's headquarters in Edinburgh, Paul and local suffragists made plans to protest a speech by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sir Edward Grey. For a week prior, they spoke with people on the streets to promote knowledge about why they were protesting against the Cabinet member. At the meeting, after Grey discussed proposed legislation he claimed would lead to prosperity, Paul stood up and exclaimed: ‚ÄúWell, these are very wonderful ideals, but couldn‚Äôt you extend them to women?‚Äù Police responded by dragging her out of the meeting and through the streets to the police station where she was arrested. As planned, this act was viewed by many as a public silencing of legitimate protest and resulted in an increase of press coverage and public sympathy. Later events involved even more risk of bodily harm. Before a political meeting at St. Andrew's Hall in Glasgow in August 1909, Paul camped out on the roof of the hall so that she could address the crowd below. When she was forced by police to descend, crowds cheered her effort. Later, when Paul, Burns, and fellow suffragettes attempted to enter the event, they were beaten by police as sympathetic bystanders attempted to protect them. After Paul and her fellow protesters were taken into custody, crowds gathered outside the police station demanding the women's release. On November 9, 1909, in honor of Lord Mayor's Day, the Lord Mayor of London hosted a banquet for cabinet ministers in the city's Guild Hall. Paul planned the WSPU's response; she and Amelia Brown disguised themselves as cleaning women and entered into the building with the normal staff at 9:00 am. Once in the building, the women hid until the event started that evening. It was then that they came out of hiding and \\"took their stand\\". When Prime Minister H. H. Asquith stood to speak, Brown threw her shoe through a pane of stained glass and both women yelled \\"Votes for women!\\" Following this event, both women were arrested and sentenced to one month hard labor after refusing to pay fines and damages.  Civil disobedience and hunger strikes  While associated with the Women's Social and Political Union, Paul was arrested seven times and imprisoned three times. It was during her time in prison that she learned the tactics of civil disobedience from Emmeline Pankhurst. Chief among these tactics was demanding to be treated as a political prisoner upon arrest. This not only sent a message about the legitimacy of the suffragists to the public but also had the potential to provide tangible benefits. In many European countries, including England, political prisoners were given a special status: \\"[T]hey were not searched upon arrest, not housed with the rest of the prisoner population, not required to wear prison garb, and not force-fed if they engaged in hunger strikes.\\" Though arrested suffragettes often were not afforded the status of political prisoners, this form of civil disobedience provided a lot of press for the WSPU. For example, during a London arrest (after being denied political prisoner status), Paul refused to put on prisoner's clothing. After the prison matrons were unable to forcibly undress her, they requested assistance from male guards. This shockingly improper act provided extensive press coverage for the suffrage movement. Another popular civil disobedience tactic used by the Suffragettes was hunger striking. The first WSPU related hunger strike was conducted by sculptor Marion Wallace Dunlop in June 1909. By that fall it was being widely used by WSPU members because of its effectiveness in publicizing their mistreatment and gaining quick release from prison wardens. Refusing food worked in securing an early release for Paul during her first two arrests. However, during her third prison stint, the warden ordered twice daily force-feeding to keep Paul strong enough to finish out her month-long sentence. Though the prisons staunchly maintained that the force-feeding of prisoners was for their own benefit, Paul and other women described the process as torturous. At the end of her month in prison, Paul had developed severe gastritis. She was carried out of prison and immediately tended to by a doctor. However, after this event, her health was permanently scarred; she often developed colds and flu which would sometimes require hospitalization. Paul had been given a Hunger Strike Medal 'for Valour' by WSPU. === United States === After the ordeal of her final London imprisonment, Paul returned to the United States in January 1910 to continue her recovery and to develop a plan for suffrage work back home. Paul's experiences in England were well-publicized, and the American news media quickly began following her actions upon her return home. She drew upon the teachings of Woodbrooke and her religion and quickly decided that she wanted to embrace a single goal as a testimony. The single goal she chose was the recognition of women as equal citizens. Paul re-enrolled at the University of Pennsylvania, pursuing her Ph.D., while speaking about her experiences in the British suffrage movement to Quaker audiences and starting to work towards United States suffrage on the local level. After completing her dissertation, a comprehensive overview of the history of the legal status of United States women, she began participating in National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) rallies, and in April 1910 was asked to speak at NAWSA's annual convention. After this major opportunity, Paul and Burns proposed to NAWSA leadership a campaign to gain a federal amendment guaranteeing the vote for women. This was wholly contrary to NAWSA's state-by-state strategy. Paul and Burns were laughed at by NAWSA leadership; the only exception was Jane Addams, who suggested that the women tone down their plan. As a response, Paul asked to be placed on the organization's Congressional Committee.  1913 Woman Suffrage Procession  Inez Milholland leading the Woman Suffrage Procession on horseback One of Paul's first big projects was initiating and organizing the 1913 Woman Suffrage Procession in Washington the day before President Wilson's inauguration. Paul was determined to put pressure on Wilson, because the President would have the most influence over Congress. She assigned volunteers to contact suffragists around the nation and recruit supporters to march in the parade. In a matter of weeks, Paul succeeded in gathering roughly eight thousand marchers, representing most of the country. However, she had much more trouble gaining institutional support for the protest parade. Paul was insistent that the parade route go along Pennsylvania Avenue before President Wilson. The goal was to send the message that the push for women's suffrage existed before Wilson and would outlast him if need be. This route was originally resisted by DC officials, and according to biographer Christine Lunardini, Paul was the only one who truly believed the parade would take place on that route. Eventually the city ceded the route to NAWSA. However, this was not the end of the parade's troubles. The City Supervisor Sylvester claimed that the women would not be safe marching along the Pennsylvania Avenue route and strongly suggested the group move the parade. Paul responded by demanding Sylvester provide more police; something that was not done. On March 3, 1913, the parade gained a boost in legitimacy as Congress passed a special resolution ordering Sylvester to prohibit all ordinary traffic along the parade route and \\"prevent any interference\\" with the suffrage marchers. Cover to the program for the 1913 Woman Suffrage Procession which Paul organized On the day of the event, the procession proceeded along Paul's desired route. The event, which was led by notable labor lawyer Inez Milholland dressed in white and riding a horse, was described by the New York Times as \\"one of the most impressively beautiful spectacles ever staged in this country\\". Multiple bands, banners, squadrons, chariots, and floats were also displayed in the parade representing all women's lives. One of the most notable sights was the lead banner in the parade which declared, \\"We Demand an Amendment to the United States Constitution Enfranchising the Women of the Country.\\" Some participating groups and leaders, however, wanted black and white women's organizations to be segregated but NAWSA, after much discussion, decided black women could march where they wished. Still, Ida B. Wells was asked not to march with the Chicago delegation; ultimately, she marched with her state group. Over half a million people came to view the parade, and with insufficient police protection, the situation soon devolved into a near-riot, with onlookers pressing so close to the women that they were unable to proceed. Police largely did nothing to protect the women from rioters. A senator who participated in the march later testified that he personally took the badge numbers of 22 officers who had stood idle, including 2 sergeants. Eventually, the Massachusetts and Pennsylvania national guards stepped in and students from the Maryland Agricultural College provided a human barrier to help the women pass. Some accounts even describe Boy Scouts as stepping in and providing first aid to the injured. The incident mobilized public dialogue about the police response to the women's demonstration, producing greater awareness and sympathy for NAWSA. After the parade, the NAWSA's focus was lobbying for a constitutional amendment to secure the right to vote for women. Such an amendment had originally been sought by suffragists Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton who, as leaders of the NWSA, fought for a federal amendment to the constitution securing women's suffrage until the 1890 formation of NAWSA, which campaigned for the vote on a state-by-state basis.  National Woman's Party Paul's militant methods started to create tension between her and the leaders of NAWSA, who thought she was moving too aggressively in Washington. Eventually, disagreements about strategy and tactics led to a break with NAWSA. Paul formed the Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage and, later, the National Woman's Party (NWP) in 1916. The NWP began introducing some of the methods used by the suffrage movement in Britain and focused entirely on achieving a constitutional amendment for woman suffrage. Alva Belmont, a multi-millionaire socialite at the time, was the largest donor to Paul's efforts. The NWP was accompanied by press coverage and the publication of the weekly newspaper, The Suffragist. Silent Sentinels In the US presidential election of 1916, Paul and the National Woman's Party (NWP) campaigned in western states where women could already vote against the continuing refusal of President Woodrow Wilson and other incumbent Democrats to actively support the Suffrage Amendment. Paul went to Mabel Vernon to help her organize a picketing campaign. In January 1917, the NWP staged the first political protest and picketing at the White House. Picketing had been legalized by the 1914 Clayton Antitrust Act, so the women were not doing anything illegal. The pickets, participating in a nonviolent civil disobedience campaign known as the \\"Silent Sentinels\\", dressed in white, silent and with 2,000 taking part over two years, maintained a presence six days a week, holding banners demanding the right to vote. Paul knew the only way they could accomplish their goal was by displaying the President's attitude toward suffrage, so picketing would achieve this in the best manner. Each day Paul would issue \\"General Orders\\", selecting women to be in charge and who would speak for the day. She was the \\"Commandant\\" and Mabel Vernon was the \\"Officer of the Day\\". In order to get volunteers for the pickets, Paul created state days, such as Pennsylvania Day, Maryland Day, and Virginia Day, and she created special days for professional women, such as doctors, nurses, and lawyers. After the United States entered World War I in April 1917, many people viewed the picketing Silent Sentinels as disloyal. Paul made sure the picketing would continue. In June 1917, picketers were arrested on charges of \\"obstructing traffic\\". Over the next six months, many, including Paul, were convicted and incarcerated at the Occoquan Workhouse in Virginia (which later became the Lorton Correctional Complex) and the District of Columbia Jail. When the public heard the news of the first arrests, some were surprised that leading suffragists and very well-connected women were going to prison for peacefully protesting. President Wilson received bad publicity from this event, and was livid with the position he was forced into. He quickly pardoned the first women arrested on July 19, two days after they had been sentenced, but reporting on the arrests and abuses continued. The Boston Journal, for example, stated, \\"The little band representing the NWP has been abused and bruised by government clerks, soldiers and sailors until its efforts to attract the President's attention has sunk into the conscience of the whole nation.\\" Suffragists continued picketing outside the White House after the Wilson pardon, and throughout World War I. Their banners contained such slogans as \\"Mr. President, How Long Must Women Wait For Liberty?\\" and \\"We Shall Fight for the Things Which We Have Always Held Nearest Our Hearts‚ÄîFor Democracy, For The Right of Those Who Submit To Authority To Have A Voice in Their Own Governments.\\" With the hope of embarrassing Wilson, some of the banners contained his quotes. Wilson ignored these women, but his daughter Margaret waved in acknowledgement. Although the suffragists protested peacefully, their protests were sometimes violently opposed. While protesting, young men would harass and beat the women, with the police never intervening on behalf of the protesters. Police would even arrest other men who tried to help the women who were getting beaten. Even though they were protesting during wartime, they maintained public support by agitating peacefully. Throughout this time, more protesters were arrested and sent to Occoquan or the District Jail. Pardons were no longer offered. ===Prison, hunger strikes, passage of 19th Amendment=== Alice Paul toasting (with grape juice) passage of the Nineteenth Amendment. August 26, 1920 In solidarity with other activists in her organization, Paul purposefully strove to receive the seven-month jail sentence that started on October 20, 1917. She began serving her time in the District Jail. Whether sent to Occoquan or the District Jail, the women were given no special treatment as political prisoners and had to live in harsh conditions with poor sanitation, infested food, and dreadful facilities. In protest of the conditions at the District Jail, Paul began a hunger strike.\\"Miss Alice Paul on Hunger Strike\\", The New York Times, November 7, 1917. Accessed June 25, 2012. This led to her being moved to the prison's psychiatric ward and being force-fed raw eggs through a feeding tube. \\"Seems almost unthinkable now, doesn't it?\\" Paul told an interviewer from American Heritage when asked about the forced feeding. \\"It was shocking that a government of men could look with such extreme contempt on a movement that was asking nothing except such a simple little thing as the right to vote.\\"Gallagher, Robert S., \\"I Was Arrested, Of Course‚Ä¶\\", American Heritage, February 1974, Volume 25, Issue 2. Interview of Alice Paul. On November 14, 1917, the suffragists who were imprisoned at Occoquan endured brutality allegedly endorsed by prison authorities which became known as the \\"Night of Terror\\". The National Woman's Party (NWP) went to court to protest the treatment of the women such as Lucy Burns, Dora Lewis and Alice Cosu, her cellmate in Occoquan Prison, who suffered a heart attack at seeing Dora's condition. The women were later moved to the District Jail where Paul languished. Despite the brutality that she experienced and witnessed, Paul remained undaunted, and on November 27 and 28 all the suffragists were released from prison. Within two months Wilson announced there would be a bill on women's right to vote. ===Equal Rights Amendment=== In January 2019, the House and Senate introduced resolutions to remove the deadline for ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment, which was added in 1972 and which Paul accurately predicted would compromise the ERA's chances for success. Once suffrage was achieved in 1920, Paul and some members of the National Woman's Party shifted attention to constitutional guarantees of equality through the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), which was written by Paul and Crystal Eastman. Drafted and delivered to Congress in 1923, the original text of the Equal Rights Amendment‚Äîwhich Paul and the National Woman's Party dubbed the \\"Lucretia Mott Amendment\\" in honor of this antislavery and suffrage activist of an earlier generation‚Äîread, \\"Men and women shall have equal rights throughout the United States and every place subject to its jurisdiction.\\" In 1943, the amendment was renamed the \\"Alice Paul Amendment\\". Its wording was changed to the version that still exists today: \\"Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex.\\" For Paul, the ERA had the same appeal as suffrage in that it was a constitutional amendment and a single-issue campaign that she believed could and should unite women around a common core goal. Paul understood the value of single issue politics for building coalitions and securing success. Not everyone agreed about next steps or about the ERA, and from the start, the amendment had its detractors. While Paul's activism in the years after suffrage centered on securing legal protections for women's equality in the U.S. and abroad, other activists and some members of the NWP focused on a range of issues from birth control to educating newly enfranchised women voters. Some of Paul's earlier allies in suffrage found the ERA troubling, especially since they believed it would erode protective legislation‚Äîlaws about working conditions or maximum hours that protected women in the workplace. If the ERA guaranteed equality, opponents argued, protective legislation for women would be null and void. The rival League of Women Voters (LWV), which championed workplace legislation for women, opposed the Equal Rights Amendment. Paul and her cohorts, including a small group from the NWP, thought that sex-based workplace legislation restricted women's ability to compete for jobs with men and earn good wages. In fact, Paul believed that protective legislation hurt women wage earners because some employers simply fired them rather than implement protections on working conditions that safeguarded women. Women were paid less than men, lost jobs that required them to work late nights‚Äîoften a prohibition under protective legislation‚Äîand they had long been blocked from joining labor unions on par with men. She also believed that women should be treated under the law the same way men were and not as a class that required protection. To Paul, such protections were merely \\"legalized inequality,\\" a position shared by suffragist Harriot Stanton Blatch. To Paul, the ERA was the most efficient way to ensure legal equality. Paul expected women workers to rally behind the ERA; some did, many did not. While early on there was hope among NWP members that they could craft a bill that would promote equality while also guaranteeing labor protection for women, to Paul, that was a contradiction. What's more, she was surprised when Florence Kelley, Ethel Smith, Jane Addams and other suffragists parted with her and aligned with protective legislation. While Paul continued to work with the NWP, and even served as president again in the 1940s, she remained steadfastly committed to women's equality as her singular mission. Along with the ERA, Paul worked on behalf of similar efforts in state legislation and in international contexts. She helped ensure that the United Nations proclamations include equality for women and hoped that this would encourage the United States to follow suit. Paul worked to change laws that altered a woman's citizenship based on that of her husband. In the U.S., women who married men from foreign countries lost their U.S. citizenship and were considered by the U.S. to be citizens of whatever country their husbands were from. To Paul, this was a violation of equal rights, and as such, she worked on behalf of the international Equal Nationality Treaty in 1933 and in the U.S. for the successful passage of the Equal Nationality Act in 1934, which let women retain their citizenship upon marriage. Just after the founding of the United Nations in 1945, Paul wanted to ensure that women's equality was a part of the organization's charter and that its Commission on Human Rights included a focus on women's equality in its Universal Declaration of Human Rights. She prevailed: the final version of the Declaration in 1948 opened with a reference to \\"equal rights of men and women\\". The ERA was introduced in Congress in 1923 and had various peaks and valleys of support in the years that followed, as Paul continued to push for its passage. There were favorable committee reports in Congress in the late 1930s, and with more women working in men's jobs during the war, public support for the ERA also increased. In 1946, the ERA passed by three votes in the Senate, not the majority needed for it to advance. Four years later, it would garner the Senate votes but fail in the House, thereby halting it from moving forward. Paul was encouraged when women's movement activism gained steam in the 1960s and 1970s, which she hoped would spell victory for the ERA. When the bill finally passed Congress in 1972, Paul was unhappy about the changes in the wording of the ERA that now included time limits for securing its passage. Advocates argued that this compromise‚Äîthe newly added seven-year deadline for ratification in the states‚Äîenabled the ERA's passage in Congress, but Paul correctly predicted that the inclusion of a time limit would ensure its defeat. To include a deadline meant that if the ERA was not ratified by 38 states within seven years, it would fail and supporters would effectively have to start from scratch again if they wanted to see it passed (something that was not the case with the suffrage or other proposed constitutional amendments). In addition, this version put enforcement power in the hands of the federal government only; Paul's original and 1943 reworded version required both states and the federal government to oversee its provisions. Paul's version was strategic: politicians who believed in states' rights, including many Southern states, were more likely to support an ERA that gave states some enforcement authority than a version that did not. Paul was proved correct: while the ERA did receive a three-year extension from Congress, it remained three states short of those needed for ratification. States continued to attempt to ratify the ERA long after the deadline passed, including Nevada in 2017 and Illinois in 2018. In 2017 and again in 2019, the Senate and House introduced resolutions to remove the deadline from the ERA, measures that, if passed, would make the amendment viable again. ===1964 Civil Rights Act=== Paul played a major role in adding protection for women in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, despite the opposition of liberals who feared it would end protective labor laws for women. The prohibition on sex discrimination was added to the Civil Rights Act by Howard W. Smith, a powerful Virginia Democrat who chaired the House Rules Committee. Smith's amendment was passed by a teller vote of 168 to 133. For twenty years Smith had sponsored the Equal Rights Amendment in the House because he believed in equal rights for women, even though he opposed equal rights for blacks. For decades he had been close to the National Woman's Party and especially to Paul. She and other feminists had worked with Smith since 1945 trying to find a way to include sex as a protected civil rights category. ==Personal life and death== Paul had an active social life until she moved to Washington in late 1912. She enjoyed close relationships with women and befriended and occasionally dated men. Paul did not preserve private correspondence for the most part, so few details about her personal life are available. Once Paul devoted herself to winning the vote for women, she placed the suffrage effort first in her life. Nevertheless, Elsie Hill and Dora Kelly Lewis, two women whom she met early in her work for NAWSA, remained close to her all their lives. She knew William Parker, a scholar she met at the University of Pennsylvania, for several years; he may have tendered a marriage proposal in 1917. A more thorough discussion of Paul's familial relations and friendships is found in J.D. Zahniser's biography. Paul became a vegetarian around the time of the suffrage campaign. Alice Paul's gravesite Paul died at the age of 92 on July 9, 1977, at the Greenleaf Extension Home, a Quaker facility in Moorestown, New Jersey, less than a mile from her birthplace and childhood home at Paulsdale.

Her alma mater, Swarthmore College, named a dormitory Alice Paul Residence Hall in her honor. Montclair State University in New Jersey has also named a dormitory (Alice Paul Hall) in her honor. On April 12, 2016, President Barack Obama designated Sewall-Belmont House as the Belmont‚ÄìPaul Women's Equality National Monument, named for Alice Paul and Alva Belmont. The University of Pennsylvania, her doctoral alma mater, maintains the Alice Paul Center for Research on Gender, Sexuality, and Women. Two countries have honored her by issuing a postage stamp: Great Britain in 1981 and the United States in 1995. The U.S. stamp was the $0.78 Great Americans series stamp. Paul appeared on a United States half-ounce $10 gold coin in 2012, as part of the First Spouse Gold Coin Series. A provision in the Presidential $1 Coin Programsee directs that Presidential spouses be honored. As President Chester A. Arthur was a widower, Paul is shown representing \\"Arthur's era\\".Alice Paul is explicitly specified in The U.S. Treasury Department announced in 2016 that an image of Paul will appear on the back of a newly designed $10 bill along with Lucretia Mott, Sojourner Truth, Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and the 1913 Woman Suffrage Procession that Paul initiated and organized. Designs for the new $5, $10, and $20 bills will be unveiled in 2020 in conjunction with the 100th anniversary of American women winning the right to vote via the 19th Amendment. In 1987, a group of New Jersey women raised the money to purchase Paul's papers when they came up for auction so that an archive could be established. Her papers and memorabilia are now held by the Schlesinger Library at Harvard University, and the Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C. In 1990, the same group, now the Alice Paul Institute, purchased the brick farmhouse, Paulsdale, in Mount Laurel, New Jersey, where Paul was born. Paulsdale is a National Historic Landmark and is on the New Jersey and National Registers of Historic Places. The Alice Paul Institute keeps her legacy alive with educational exhibits about her life, accomplishments and advocacy for gender equality. Hilary Swank played Paul in the 2004 movie Iron Jawed Angels, which portrayed the 1910 women's suffrage movement for passage of the 19th Amendment. In 2018, Alice Paul was a central character in an episode of Timeless (Season 2, Episode 7) which alludes to Paul giving an impassioned speech to President Woodrow Wilson during a march that ends in police violence upon the suffragist marchers. According to history, Paul was at the event, and was arrested, but there is no evidence that she spoke to Wilson on that day. On January 11, 2016, Google Doodle commemorated her 131st birthday. == See also == *Iron Jawed Angels, 2004 film about Alice Paul and Lucy Burns and their movement which resulted in the passage of the 19th Amendment. *List of civil rights leaders *List of suffragists and suffragettes *List of women's rights activists *Timeline of women's suffrage *Timeline of women's suffrage in the United States *Women's suffrage organizations ==References== ==Further reading== * Baker, Jean H.

John Mills played Scott, with a supporting cast which included James Robertson Justice, Derek Bond, Kenneth More, John Gregson, Barry Letts and Christopher Lee. Produced by Ealing Studios, the film was directed by Charles Frend and largely shot at the studios, with some landscape and glacier exteriors shot in the Swiss Alps and in Norway;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040761/locations?ref_=tt_dt_dt no actual scenes were made in Antarctica, though some pre-war stock footage from Graham Land may have been used. The film was made in Technicolor. The script was by Ivor Montagu, Walter Meade and the novelist Mary Hayley Bell, Mills' wife. The film is also known for its score by Ralph Vaughan Williams that was later reworked into his Sinfonia antartica. The film is largely faithful to the real events of the ill-fated polar trek, with emphasis on the stoic character of Scott and the hostility of the Antarctic environment. ==Plot== Captain Scott is given the men, but not the funds, to go on a second expedition to the Antarctic. As his wife works on a bust of him, she tells him that she's \\"not the least jealous\\" that he's going to the Antarctic again. The wife of Dr. E. A. Wilson, whom Scott hopes to recruit, is much less enthusiastic, but Wilson agrees to go on condition it is a scientific expedition. Scott also visits Fridtjof Nansen, who insists that a polar expedition must use only dogs, not machines or horses. Scott goes on a fundraising campaign, with mixed results, finding scepticism among Liverpool businessmen, but enthusiasm among schoolchildren who fund the sledge dogs. With the help of a government grant he finally manages to raise enough money to finance the expedition. After a stop in New Zealand, the ship sets sail for Antarctica. Once there, a camp is set up at the coast, and a small contingent of men, ponies and dogs begins the trek towards the pole. About halfway, the ponies are shot and some of the men are sent back with the dogs. At the three quarter mark, Scott selects the five-man team to make the push to the pole. They reach the pole only to find the Norwegian flag already planted there and a letter from Roald Amundsen asking Scott to deliver it to the King of Norway. Hugely disappointed, Scott's team begins the long journey back. When reaching the mountains bordering the polar plateau, Wilson shows the men some sea plant and tree fossils he has found, also a piece of coal, to Scott's satisfaction, proving that the Antarctic must have been a warm place once, and opening economic possibilities. The perceived lack of such opportunities had been one criticism leveled at Scott while fundraising. Nevertheless, Scott is increasingly concerned about the health of two of his men: Evans, who has a serious cut on his hand, and Oates, whose foot is appallingly frostbitten. Evans eventually dies and is buried under the snow. Realising that his condition is slowing the team down, Oates sacrifices himself by walking out of the tent into a blizzard to his death after saying \\"I'm just going outside and may be away some time.\\" Finally, just 11 miles short of a supply depot, the rest of the team dies in their tent after being trapped by a blizzard, with Scott writing the famous \\"I do not regret this journey‚Ä¶\\" entry in his diary. Months later, a search party discovers the tent and the bodies. Scott's diary is also recovered, allowing the members to learn of the polar party's fate. The film ends with the sight of a large wooden cross with the five names of the dead inscribed on it as well as the quote : \\"To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.\\" (A line from the poem \\"Ulysses\\", by the Victorian era poet Alfred, Lord Tennyson.) ==Cast== * John Mills as Captain R.F.

These were the days when we were inspired by the heroic deeds typical of British greatness.\\" In 1944, Charles Frend and Sidney Cole pitched the idea of a film about the Scott expedition. Balcon was interested, so they wrote up a story treatment which Balcon approved. Ealing secured co-operation from Scott's widow (who would die in 1947). Walter Meade wrote the first draft. In 1947 it was announced that John Mills, then one of the biggest stars in Britain, would play the title role. \\"This is the most responsible thing I have done in films,\\" said Mills. \\"I was only about four when the tragedy happened, but Scott has always been one of my heroes and it's jolly satisfying to feel that the job of helping to bring the great story of British enterprise and grit to the screen has fallen to me.\\" Three years' research was done for the film. Cameraman Osmond Baradaile spent six months in 1946-47 shooting background footage in the Antarctic at Hope Bay as well as at South Shetland and the Orkneys, travelling 30,000 miles. ===Shooting=== Filming started in June 1947 in Switzerland for four weeks, at the Jungrau Mountain and the Aletsch Glacier. In October 1947 there was further nine weeks location filming in Norway, near Finse, which was used to represent the area near the South Pole. The bulk of the scenes were shot at the Hardanger Jokul.REALISM ON ICE: Scott Polar Movie Being Made in Norway Fjords New York Times 21 Dec 1947: X6. The film recreates this sombre photograph taken by Scott and his crew at the South Pole The film's unit transferred to Ealing studios in London for three months of studio work. Playing the role, Mills wore Scott's actual watch which had been taken from his dead body.Bringing the South Pole to Britain: How we made the Scott film Mills, John. Answers; London Vol. 114, Iss. 2953, (May 8, 1948): 3, 18. ==Acknowledgements== At the start of the film, consulted survivors and relatives of late members of Scott's expedition are thanked for their help: \\"This film could not have been made without the generous co- operation of the survivors and the relatives of late members of Scott's Last Expedition. To them and to those many other persons and organisations too numerous to mention individually who gave such able assistance and encouragement, the producers express their deepest gratitude.\\" ==Departures from the historical course of events== There are several minor differences between the film and the true course of events: In the film, Scott receives a telegram in New Zealand, but does not read it for himself or to the crew until his ship is en route to the Antarctic. It says: \\"I am going south. Amundsen\\". Scott and his crew immediately comprehend that Amundsen is heading for the South Pole. Historically however, Scott received this telegram a little earlier, in Australia, and Amundsen's true text was less clear: \\"Beg leave to inform you Fram proceeding Antarctic Amundsen.\\" [Fram was Amundsen's ship]. As Amundsen had publicly announced he was going to the North Pole, the real Scott and his companions did not initially grasp Amundsen's ambiguous message, according to Tryggve Gran's diary (Gran was Scott's only Norwegian expedition member). In the film, the Terra Nova disembarks Scott's team in the Antarctic, sails along the ice barrier without Scott and unexpectedly discovers Amundsen's Antarctic base camp. The ship therefore returns to Scott's base camp and informs Scott about Amundsen's presence in the vicinity. In historical fact, Scott was not at his base camp during this unscheduled return of his ship, but was busy laying depots in the interior of the Antarctic. In the film, just before reaching the South Pole, Scott's team sight a black flag planted by Amundsen, and the men realise the race is lost. In the next scene, the men arrive at Amundsen's empty tent (flying a Norwegian flag) at the South Pole, and discover the paw prints of Amundsen's sledge-dogs. In historical reality, Scott and his men discovered the paw prints (and dog excrement) on the previous day at the black flag. The film gives the impression that Scott asks himself at the South Pole whether he can manage to return to base camp safely. In reality, Scott wrote in his diary that he wished \\"to get the news through first\\" (both Scott and Amundsen had lucrative agreements with the media on exclusive interviews), but Scott realistically doubted whether he could do it (i.e., beat Amundsen to the cablehead in Australia). This error in the film is based on a small omission in the originally published diary, an omission that was rediscovered long after the film was produced.\\"Race for the South Pole. The Expedition Diaries of Scott and Amundsen.\\" Roland Huntford. 2010, Continuum, London, New York. ==Causes of the tragedy== Given that some of the real expedition members were still alive at the time of filming and were consulted, the film documents the causes for the tragedy as they were seen at the time (1948). These causes are alluded to discreetly throughout the film: *In Norway, Scott consults the veteran polar explorer Nansen, who urges Scott to rely only on dogs. Scott on the other hand insists on a variety of transport means, including motor sledges, ponies, and dogs. The historical background to Scott's portrayed reluctance is that on his 1904 expedition, Scott's dogs had died of disease while Shackleton in 1908 had nearly attained the South Pole using ponies. *Scott's depicted fundraising speech is not effective, and the government gives him only ¬£20,000. To make the expedition possible anyway, he cancels one of his two planned ships, and settles on the dilapidated Terra Nova, a photo of which he optimistically shows to Wilson, who is unmoved. This scene reflects the real Cherry-Garrard's criticism over the lack of funds and the inappropriate ship, in his book The Worst Journey in the World. *Arriving in Antarctic waters, the ship is briefly seen to fight its way through pack-ice. The parallel to the real expedition is that the ship was delayed for the unusual period of 20 days in the pack-ice, shortening the available season for preparations. *Having ascended the glacier up to the polar plateau, Scott sends home one of the supporting parties, addressing its leader Atkinson (\\"Atch\\") with the following words \\"Bye Atch. Look out for us about the beginning of March. With any luck we will be back before the ship has to go.\\" This paraphrases Scott's real order to the dog teams to assist him home to base camp around March 1 at latitude 82 degrees. The order was never carried out and so Scott and his men died on their way home at the end of March.About the first week of February I should like you to start your third journey to the South, the object being to hasten the return of the third Southern unit [the polar party] and give it a chance to catch the ship. The date of your departure must depend on news received from returning units, the extent of the depot of dog food you have been able to leave at One Ton Camp, the state of the dogs, etc ... It looks at present as though you should aim at meeting the returning party about March 1 in Latitude 82 or 82.30. Evans, E.R.G.R. 1949, South with Scott, London: Collins, pp187-188 *On the return journey from the pole, the men find that the oil canisters in the depots are not full. The seals are not broken, so they speculate that the oil has evaporated. ==ReceptionRelease=== The film was chosen for a Royal Command Film Performance in 1948. ===Box office=== Scott of the Antarctic was the third most popular film at the British box office in 1949. According to Kinematograph Weekly the 'biggest winner' at the box office in 1949 Britain was The Third Man with \\"runners up\\" being Johnny Belinda, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, Paleface, Scott of the Antarctic, The Blue Lagoon, Maytime in Mayfair, Easter Parade, Red River and You Can't Sleep Here.

One of three battles in a Brigade-size operation all on the same night, the other two being the Battle of Mount Longdon and the Battle of Two Sisters. One of a number of night battles that took place during the British advance towards Stanley, the battle led to British troops capturing all the heights above the town, allowing its capture and the surrender of the Argentine forces on the islands. ==Background== The British force consisted of 42 Commando (42 CDO), Royal Marines under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Nick Vaux's Royal Marines (he later became a general) with artillery support from a battery of 29 Commando Regiment, Royal Artillery. Engineer support from 2Tp, 59 Independent Commando Squadron (59 Ind CDO Sqn), Royal Engineers. The 1st Battalion, Welsh Guards (1WG) and two companies from 40 Commando (40 CDO) were in reserve. HMS Yarmouth provided naval gunfire support. The Argentine defenders consisted of ex-Army Green Beret Captain Carlos Alberto Arroyo's B Company from Lieutenant Colonel Diego Alejandro Soria's 4th Monte Caseros Infantry Regiment (RI 4). On 1 June, the Argentine defenders on Harriet and Two Sisters, after having abandoned their field kitchens in their original positions on Mount Challenger, were given permission by their officers to consume their cold-weather ration packs, which helped raise the morale of the conscripts.\\"From 1 June, 4th Infantry Regiment, on Two Sisters and Mount Harriet, was given permission by their commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel Diego Soria, to use their US \\"C\\" ration packs, which helped to raise morale and keep the soldiers fit.\\" 9 Battles To Stanley, Nick Van Der Bijl, p. 155, Pen & Sword, 2014 On the night of 30 May, K Company of 42 CDO boarded three Sea King helicopters and moved forward of San Carlos to secure the commanding heights of Mount Kent at ,Mount Kent - Falkland Islands at Peakery.com one of the tallest of the peaks surrounding Stanley where Major Cedric Delves' D Squadron from the Special Air Service (SAS) had established a strong presence. When the Royal Marines reinforcements and 7 'Sphinx' Battery of the 29th Commando Regiment Royal Artillery aboard a Chinook helicopter, arrived at the landing zone, 3 kilometres (2 miles) behind the ridge of the mountain, they were met by gun-flashes, mortar detonations and tracer rounds as a second clash involving D Squadron was taking place.

At the same time, Captain Matthew Selfridge's D Company scouting ahead of 3 PARA took Teal Inlet Settlement, at the cost of one wounded through an accidental discharge. The SAS soldiers came under mortar bombardment while evacuating their wounded and the Royal Marines from 7 'Sphinx' Battery of the 29th Commando Regiment Royal Artillery reported the loss of one gunner (Van Rooyen), who suffered a broken arm while taking cover among the rocks during the bombardment.The National Archives The rest of 42 Commando made a march across the hills north of Mount Simon to reinforce Mounts Kent and Challenger overlooking Port Stanley. The weather conditions were atrocious, with the Marines advancing through steep slippery hillocks and stone-runs to their objectives.

Some night-fighting patrols were part of a deception to convince the Argentines that the attack would come from a westerly direction. Other, more covert patrols were to find a route through a minefield around the south of Mount Harriet. Sniping and naval artillery were used to harass the defenders and deny them sleep. On 3 June, Lieutenant Chris Marwood's Reconnaissance Troop of 42 CDO on Mount Wall, accompanying the 3 Commando Brigade Forward Air Control team commanded by Flight Lieutenant Dennis Marshall-Hasdell, encountered two rifle sections from the 4th Monte Caseros Regiment (Second Lieutenant Lautaro Jim√©nez Corbal√°n's 3rd Platoon of B Company from Mount Harriet).5th Infantry Brigade in the Falklands 1982.

On the night of 8‚Äì9 June, action on the outer defence zone flared when Lieutenant Mark Townsend's 1 Troop (K Company, 42 CDO) probed Mount Harriet, killing two Argentines (Corporal Hipolito Gonzalez and Private Martiniano Gomez) from Second Lieutenant Jim√©nez Corbal√°n's 3rd Platoon.5th Infantry Brigade in the Falklands 1982. Nicholas Van der Bijl, David Aldea. p. 174. Leo Cooper, 2003 At the same time, two platoon-sized fighting patrols from 45 Commando attempted the same on Two Sisters Mountain, but the Argentine RASIT ground surveillance radar on Mount Longdon was able to detect the 45 Commando platoons, and artillery fire dispersed the British force. In all, Second Lieutenant Lautaro Jim√©nez Corbal√°n would report the loss of 6 killed and 14 wounded fighting off Lieutenant Marwood's Recce Troop on Mount Wall and the raid of Lieutenant Towsend's 1 Troop, including losses suffered during the final British assault on Mount Harriet on the night of 11-12 June. Around dusk on 9 June, Lieutenant-Colonel Soria's men detected the presence of British troops who had taken up positions in Port Harriet House on the southern approaches to Mount Harriet. The 4th Regiment's Reconnaissance Platoon, under Sub-Lieutenant Jorge Pasolli, received orders to move forward and clear the British from the House and the Scots Guards Reconnaissance Platoon that had moved into the area was forced to withdraw when the Argentines radioed fire support from the 120-mm Mortar Platoon dug in on Mount Harriet. Sub-Lieutenant Pasolli's men attacked and the Scots Guards returned fire with two Bren machine guns but were forced to abandon their rucksacks and radios. \\"We dashed out and began running chased by mortar rounds. Luckily the soft ground reduced their effect but all the same, we felt very vulnerable. Our bergens were slowing us down and so we ditched them. Then we saw thirty to forty Argentinians coming down off Mount Harriet. They were obviously doing a follow-up, although they were out of effective range, we harassed them with our two light machine guns.\\" Among Friends: The Scots Guards 1956-1993, Murray Naylor, p. 146, Pen and Sword, 1995\\"He decided to fly back the OC of the Recce Platoon from Port Harriet House. Shortly after the OC left the house the Argentinians attacked it. Several of the Recce Platoon were wounded. They had to make a run for it and left their radios and codes.\\" The Vital Link: The Story of Royal Signals 1945-1985, Philip Warner, p. 195, Pen and Sword, 1989 As the Guardsmen retreated, under small arms and mortar fire, they sustained three wounded, including Sergeant Ian Allum. Over a period of a week, the 4th Regiment defended the Harriet-Two Sisters sector from five Royal Marine platoon-sized attacks. Every time the Royal Marine Commandos got into the forward platoon positions, the officers, NCOs and conscripts, counterattacked forcing the British to withdraw. On 8 June, the British troopships Sir Galahad and Sir Tristram were attacked by Argentine aircraft at Bluff Cove. Lieutenant-Colonel Diego Alejandro Soria sought permission to attack the British beachhead with the 4th Regiment, but his request was denied.Only Lieutenant Colonel Diego Soria, who commanded 4th Infantry Regiment on Mount Harriet, sought permission to attack but it had been rejected. Nine Battles To Stanley, Nick Van Der Bijl, Pen & Sword Books, 2004 On the morning of 11 June, the orders for the attack were given to 42 CDO by Lieutenant Colonel Vaux. K Company was ordered to attack the eastern end of the mountain, while L Company would attack the southern side an hour later, where if the mountain was secured, would move North to occupy Goat Ridge. J Company would launch a diversionary attack (code-named Vesuvius) on the western end of Mount Harriet. If these objectives fell quickly, 42 CDO would proceed to capture Mount William.\\" The fighting had lasted longer than anticipated, leaving no time with which to proceed to their next objective: Mt William.\\" The Falklands 1982: Ground operations in the South Atlantic, Gregory Fremont-Barnes, p. 68, Bloomsbury Publishing, 2012 In the closing hours of 11 June, K and L Companies moved from their assembly area on Mount Challenger (which lay to the west of Mount Harriet) and made their way south, around their objective, across the minefield, to their respective start lines. As they moved around the feature in the dark, J Company with supporting Welsh Guards launched a loud diversionary \\"attack\\" from the west. ==Battle== A map of the Battle of Mount Harriet. The battle for Mount Harriet began on the evening of 11 June with a naval bombardment that killed two Argentinians and wounded twenty-five.Nine battles to Stanley, Nicholas Van der Bijl, p.183, Leo Cooper, 30/09/1999 John Witheroe, one of the British war correspondents, later recalled the bombardment: Speaking Out: Untold Stories from the Falklands War, p. 271, Andre Deutsch, 1989 The Argentines retaliated and Captain Tom√°s Fox, the Artillery Observation Officer on Mount Kent, directed 155mm artillery rounds that fell among the men of 'B' Company, 7th Duke of Edinburgh's Own Gurkha Rifles in the area of Bluff Cove, seriously wounding three Gurkhas, including Lance Corporal Gyanendra Rai who nearly bled to death. During the patrolling period, the Royal Marines had discovered a path through a minefield that Lieutenant Roberto Francisco Eito's platoon of sappers from the 601st Combat Engineers Company had laid around Mount Harriet, allowing the 42 Commando rifle companies to attack the two Argentine 4th Regiment companies on Harriet from the rear.Evidentemente fue una infiltraci√≥n grand√≠sima. Por los informes que tengo hasta ahora no puedo precisar exactamente el punto por donde entraron, pero s√≠ s√© que entraron por el flanco que ten√≠amos totalmente cubierto, que era el de la costa que iba para Puerto Argentino. Lo ten√≠amos- minado, ese campo minado cost√≥ mucho tiempo, cost√≥ sudor, cost√≥ bajas, y se pusieron esas minas que pesan veinte kilos. Lo que pasa es que es como todo. Aunque a uno le pongan campos minados, si tenemos que atacar, atacamos igual y ya veremos por d√≥nde pasamos. Esa misma determinaci√≥n ‚Äîpienso‚Äî la ten√≠an ellos. As√≠ lucharon, Carlos M. T√∫rolo, p. 144, Editorial Subamericana, 1982 Captain Peter Babbington's K Company crossed their start line first and proceeded up the mountain undetected, knifing two sentries on the way. They remained undetected until they approached Sub-Lieutenant Mario Juarez' 120 mm mortar platoon positions and decided to engage them. They were assisted in the advance by HMS Yarmouth's, artillery, and their own battalions mortars. During the engagement, Second Lieutenant Juarez was badly wounded firing his handgun in the dark and Corporal Laurence G Watts from K Company was killed clearing the occupants of a tent. The supporting British artillery batteries and mortar crews fired over 1,000 rounds to keep the Argentines pinned down, and helped stop the defenders getting a proper aim at the Royal Marines from K and L Companies.\\"Over 1,000 shells or bombs would fall on 'Zoya' alone that night, all of them instantly, precisely laid to cover movement, suppress defensive fire, break up resistance. They gave us an overwhelming advantage.\\" Nick Vaux, March to the South Atlantic: 42 Commando, Royal Marines in the Falklands War, p. 177, Buchan & Enright, 1986 About 150 metres from Soria's HQ, Corporal Steve Newland circled behind a group of Argentines (under First Lieutenant Jorge Alejandro Echeverria, the 4th Regiment's intelligence officer) who were setting up an ambush. Newland pulled back into cover and warned the lead elements in K Company. Each time a Royal Marine moved, Corporal Roberto Baruzzo would open fire with the help of his night vision rifle scope, to make it appear there was only one enemy sniper holding up K Company. Lieutenant Echeverria's men were holding their fire in order to encourage the British to break cover and rush their position only to run into the concentrated fire of the machine-gun and protecting riflemen. Homenaje a h√©roes de MalvinasWith half a platoon of disciplined RI4 and RI12 riflemen and a 7.62 mm general- purpose machine gun team threatening the British advance, Newland darted out from cover and charged the enemy. He neutralized the machine gun with grenades but on reaching the rear of the position, Corporal Baruzzo shot Newland in both legs. With the enemy machine gun out of action, Corporals Steve Newland, Mick Eccles and Chrystie 'Sharky' Ward were able to clear the remaining Argentine troops and captured 17 Argentines, including Echeverria who was shot five times. The three British corporals were each awarded the Military Medal. Increasing numbers of Argentine soldiers, mainly shocked and dazed conscripts from RI 4's Recce Platoon, Reserve Platoon and 120-mm Mortar Platoon began to surrender but several experienced officers (First Lieutenants Francisco Pablo D'Aloia, Esteban Guillermo Carlucci, Luis Oscar Garc√≠a) and senior NCOs fought on, in accordance to their orders. The RI 4 Commanding Officer and First Lieutenant Rub√©n Cichiara, despite heavy British fire, linked up with B Company and ordered Arroyo's men to counterattack. The heavy machine gun teams and protecting riflemen, in general, remained at their positions continuing the fight.Operation Corporate: The Falklands War, 1982, Martin Middlebrook, p.349, Viking, 1985 Captain David Wheen's L Company crossed their start line shortly after K Company and were almost immediately engaged by machine-gun fire from Sub-Lieutenant Pablo Oliva's platoon of conscripts defending the lower southern slopes. Kim Sabido, the IRN reporter with L Company, reported stiff Argentine resistance: War in the Falklands: The Full Story, p. 268, Harper & Row, 1982 The weapons in Oliva's platoon would not be silenced until being hit by several MILAN anti-tank missiles and the supporting 105mm artillery guns from Mount Challenger,Nine battles to Stanley, Nicholas Van der Bijl, p.186, Leo Cooper, 30/09/1999\\"L Company's task was to clear and secure the western end of the Mount Harriet feature. Starting after k company across the same start line, surprise had been lost and so l Company came under effective fire from heavy machine-guns within 200 metres of the start line taking three casualties almost at once. Captain Wheen, Commanding l Company, called for MILAN to fire at the machine-gun positions.\\". A Rifle Company Commander's Perspective, Major David G.

The company found that it was best to keep skirmishing forward throughout this advance because going to ground for any length of time meant sitting in the middle of the enemy artillery fire, here artillery and small arms caused a further 4 gunshot and 7 shrapnel casualties.\\". A Rifle Company Commander's Perspective, Major David G. Wheen, Royal Marinesand contend they took fire from at least seven machine guns and protecting rifle teams that wounded five men, including the company's second-in-command and his signaller. British military historian Hugh Bicheno reports that the 4th Regiment's passive night goggles were all with Arroyo's B Company.Razor's Edge (Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2006)Another 11 Marines in Wheen's Company were wounded by Argentine shellfire that Lieutenant-Colonel Soria personally brought down attempting to halt the British advance.\\"The Company found that it was best to keep skirmishing forward throughout this advance because going to ground for any length of time meant sitting in the middle of the enemy artillery defensive fire tasks that inflicted eleven casualties.\\" No Picnic, Julian Thompson, Pen & Sword, 2008 Before first light, Lieutenant Jerry Burnell's 5 Troop of L Company proceeded to an outcrop of rocks towards Goat Ridge. As they advanced, the Royal Marine platoon came under fire from Second Lieutenant Jim√©nez Corbal√°n 3rd Platoon, covering the Argentine retreat and were forced to withdraw under cover of the machine guns pre-positioned behind and further up the hill.\\"When reorganized his company, sent the prisoners to the rear and then ordered 5 troop to move forward to the company's next objective, an enemy position in the rocky outcrop about 500 Metres due North of the Western end of Harriet. Before they moved, Wheen concentrated all his available machine guns, fifteen guns in all, on the ridge. As 5 troop moved forward down the slope to the rocky outcrop, they came under heavy fire from their objective. Wheen pulled them back and then hit the enemy with mortar, artillery and machine-gun fire before ordering 5 troop forward again. They dashed forward with great determination and winkled or killed out the enemy.\\" A Rifle Company Commander's Perspective, Major David G. Wheen, Royal Marines The Troop took one casualty in this action. L Company requested mortar fire onto the Argentines; a mixture of High explosive (HE) and White phosphorus (WP); then 5 Troop moved forward supported by the 15 machine-guns positioned on the ridge. Mount Harriet &Two; Sisters The Argentinian Story They took 3 prisoners although most of Jim√©nez-Corbal√°n men had withdrawn after losing two killed in the night fighting (Privates Juan Jos√© Acu√±a and Carlos Epifanio Casco). The platoon of Oscar Augusto Silva continued to resist from Goat Ridge in the early morning light and a determined conscript (Orlando Aylan), in a position just below the summit of Mount Harriet held up L Company with accurate shooting until killed by an 84mm anti-tank rocket fired at short range.\\"One determined Argentinian sniper just below the highest part of the mountain held out long after other resistance in that area had ended. He hit 6 Troop's commander, Lieutenant Pusey, and the troop sergeant took over ...

When it came under fire from Silva's platoon in its western crags, 5 Troop withdrew to allow a fire mission to pound the rocks and then 4 Troop captured the objective.\\" Nine Battles to Stanley, Nick Van Der Bijl, Pen & Sword, 2014 At some time in the early morning darkness, Second Lieutenant Jim√©nez Corbal√°n's 3rd platoon were making their way to new positions on Mount William, the officer was concussed and temporarily blinded when he set off an Argentine booby-trap while leading his men through a minefield. At great risk to themselves, Privates Teodoro Flores and Carlos Salvatierra rescued their platoon commander and were decorated for their bravery. ==Aftermath== The battle was an example of good planning, use of deception and surprise and was a further step towards the main objective of Stanley. Two Royal Marines: Corporal Laurence G Watts and Acting Corporal Jeremy Smith were killed, and thirty were wounded, including fourteen in L Company.\\"Two Companies of 42 CDO had taken a regimental position for 2 killed and 30 wounded ... We had been ordered to be prepared to press forward the attack onto Mount Tumbledown and Mount William if the enemy fled our initial attack, and time allowed. By dawn, it was obvious that we were in no position to attack. We were exhausted, out of ammo and suffering significant casualties.

Some British reporters were thus misled into depicting the Argentineans as hapless teenage conscripts who caved in after the first shots were fired, but Royal Marine Warrant Officer 2 John Cartledge, who served with L Company during the battle, corrected them, saying the Argentines were good soldiers who had fought properly: > They used the tactics which they had been taught along the way very well, > they were quite prepared for an attack.

In principle, the title asserts and emphasises a particular freedom of the state in question, but this is not always reflected in practice. Some states use the title to assert sovereignty or independence from foreign domination, while others have used it to assert autonomy within a larger nation-state. Sometimes \\"free state\\" is used as a synonym for \\"republic\\". The republican sense of the term derives from libera res publica (literally, \\"the free public thing/affair\\"), a term used by Roman historians for the period of the Roman Republic, though not all \\"free states\\" have been republics. The historical German free states and the Orange Free State of Southern Africa were republican in form, however the Congo Free State and Irish Free State were governed under forms of monarchy. ==OverviewRepublican England=== English Parliament, in the act forming the Commonwealth of England of 1649 to 1660, declared that \\"England is confirmed to be a Commonwealth and Free State and shall from henceforth be Governed as a Commonwealth and Free State.\\" The Commonwealth had a republican constitution. ===Germany=== Flag of the modern Free State of Bavaria In Germany, the term free state (in German, Freistaat) comes from the 19th century as a German word for republic. After the German Revolution of November 1918, when Imperial Germany became a democratic republic, most of the German states within the German Reich called themselves a Free State. Others used expressions like Republik or Volksstaat (people's state) ‚Äì though unpopular, as that term was associated with the enemy France. According to the Versailles Treaty, Danzig was split off from Germany in 1919, becoming the Freie Stadt Danzig. After the Nazis came to power, they abolished the concept of a federal republic and all the states and re-organized Germany into Gaue, with appointed leadership. The states were re-established within the reduced German borders after World War II; however, from 1952 only Bavaria (successor (but not de jure) to the Kingdom of Bavaria) still called itself a Free State and that made Freistaat a synonym for Bavaria. After the reunification, the reestablished Saxony (successor (but not de jure) to the Kingdom of Saxony) used the name again in 1992 and Thuringia began to use it for the first time in 1993. Free Cities Historically, Germany had Imperial Free Cities, who were subject only to the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1871 Germany knew three Free Cities, Hamburg, Bremen and L√ºbeck; the last lost its status in 1937. Since 1949, the Federal Republic of Germany has Hamburg (Freie und Hansestadt, Free and Hanseatic City) and Bremen (Freie Hansestadt), as well as Berlin, as a city which is also a state. Like the Free States these three cities have no special rights in the federation. ===Africa=== Flag of the now defunct Orange Free State In South Africa, the term free state was used in the title of the nineteenth century Orange Free State (Oranje Vrystaat in Afrikaans) and is today used in the title of its successor, Free State; both entities were established as republican in form. In contrast, the Congo Free State came into being between 1877 and 1884 as a private kingdom or dictatorship of King Leopold II of Belgium. In this case, the term free emphasised the new state's freedom from major colonial powers and the Belgian parliament, as the colony was ruled only by the king. ===Irish Free State=== The modern Republic of Ireland was known from 1922-1937 as the Irish Free State. The Irish Free State of 1922-1937 was a form of constitutional monarchy under the British monarch. the term free state was deliberately chosen as a literal translation of the Irish word saorst√°t. At the time in which Irish nationalists (who generally favoured a republican form of state) were negotiating the secession of most of Ireland from the United Kingdom, the word saorst√°t was a commonly used Irish-language word for republic. The British did not wish to permit the creation of an Irish republic (which would mean severing all links with the British crown) and so insisted that the literal translation of saorst√°t be used in the new state's English title instead. The term saorst√°t thus represented a compromise in terminology: constitutional monarchists could accept it as a less explicit rejection of the monarchy than the term republic itself, while republicans could choose to interpret it as signifying a republic by any other name. ===Puerto Rico=== Flag of the Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico (\\"Associated Free State of Puerto Rico\\") The official Spanish name of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico, literally, \\"Associated Free State of Puerto Rico\\", expressing a \\"politically organized community‚Äù or ‚ÄúState,‚Äù which is simultaneously connected by a compact to a larger political system and hence does not have an independent and separate status. However, according to the United States Supreme Court, Puerto Rico is not free or associated; it is only a state in the general sense, not as a state of the Union in the U.S. constitutional sense. According to consistent U.S. Supreme Court jurisprudence, Puerto Rico belongs to but is not an integral part (Organized incorporated territory) of the United States. Moreover, the said jurisprudence has determined that regardless of what nominal or cosmetic veneer has moted Puerto Rico's political status, it is essentially a U.S. colonial territory, since it is under the plenary powers of the U.S. Congress. At its most basic, this Supreme Court doctrine expresses that Puerto Rico is more like property, far from a free-governing community or nation, and thus \\"domestic in a foreign sense\\" (not for the taking or meddling by free foreign nations), but \\"foreign in a domestic sense\\" (not a partner or an equal). In the Insular Cases, the Court ruled that the United States Constitution does not automatically apply in Puerto Rico. ==List of 'free states'Extant=== * Free State of Bavaria * Free State of Saxony * Free State of Thuringia * Free State, South Africa * Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico ===Historical=== * Commonwealth of England (1649‚Äì1660) * Free State of Costa Rica (1838‚Äì1847) * Orange Free State (1854‚Äì1900) * Free State of Jones (1863‚Äì1865) * Congo Free State (1884‚Äì1908) * Klein Vrystaat \\"Little Free State\\" (1886‚Äì1891) * Free State of Icaria (1912) * Free State of Fiume (1920‚Äì1924) * Kamchatka Free State (1921‚Äì1922) * Chukotka Free State (1922‚Äì1923) * Irish Free State (1922‚Äì1937) * Free Territory of Trieste (1947‚Äì1954) * Free Lebanon State (1979-1984) Germany * Free State of Coburg (1918‚Äì1920) * Free State of Bottleneck () (1919‚Äì1923) * Free State of Waldeck-Pyrmont (1918‚Äì1929) * Free State of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (1918‚Äì1933) * Free State of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (1918‚Äì1933) * Free State of Anhalt (1918‚Äì1945) * Free State of Brunswick (1918‚Äì1945) * People's State of Hesse (1918‚Äì1945) * Free State of Oldenburg (1918‚Äì1946) * Free State of Schaumburg-Lippe (1918‚Äì1945) * Free State of Lippe (1918‚Äì1947) * Free State of Prussia (1920‚Äì1947) * Free People's State of W√ºrttemberg (1918‚Äì1945) * Free Republic of Schwarzenberg (May‚ÄìJune 1945) * Freistaat Baden (1945‚Äì1952; called \\"South Baden\\" until 1947) ==See also== *Free city (disambiguation) *Freetown *List of former sovereign states ==References== Category:Country name etymology Category:Forms of government ","title":"Free state (polity)"},{"id":"526403","text":"Secord may refer to: ;People * Al Secord (born 1958), retired professional NHL ice hockey player * David Secord (1759‚Äì1844), businessman and political figure in Upper Canada * George Secord (1805‚Äì????), politician from Ontario, Canada * James A.

The party was created by Attorney- General Edward Patrick Morris in 1907, when he split from the ruling Liberal Party to found his own political vehicle. The party tied with the Liberals in the 1908 election but, when no party was able to form a government, new elections were held which the People's Party won with 26 seats to 10 for the Liberals. Morris and the People's Party were re-elected in the 1913 election, winning 16 seats compared to 7 for the Liberals and 8 for the Fishermen's Protective Union led by William Coaker. In 1917, a wartime crisis over conscription resulted in Morris inviting the opposition parties to join in a National Government, which ruled for two years. Morris retired at the end of 1917, and was replaced as People's Party leader by Sir Michael Patrick Cashin. Cashin's government was defeated in the 1919 election by Richard Squires and his Liberal Reform Party (a merger between the Liberals and the FPU). In opposition, Cashin changed the name of the party to the Liberal-Labour- Progressive Party, which disappeared after the 1923 election. Some members of that party joined Albert Hickman's new Liberal-Progressive Party, and others joined with Tories to form the Liberal-Conservative Progressive Party. Although not a sectarian party, the People's Party and its immediate successor had their support concentrated among Catholic voters, particularly on the south coast of the island. ==List of Leaders== Newfoundland People's Party * Edward Patrick Morris 1907-1917 * Michael Patrick Cashin 1917-1919 Liberal- Labour-Progressive Party of Newfoundland * Michael Patrick Cashin 1919-1923 ==See also== * List of political parties in Newfoundland and Labrador * General elections in Newfoundland (pre-Confederation) * List of Newfoundland Prime Ministers Category:Political parties in the Dominion of Newfoundland Category:Political parties established in 1907 Category:Political parties disestablished in 1923 Category:1907 establishments in Newfoundland Category:1923 disestablishments in Newfoundland ","title":"Newfoundland People's Party"},{"id":"526414","text":"The nForce2 chipset was released by Nvidia in July 2002 as a refresh to the original nForce product offering. The nForce2 chipset was a platform for motherboards supporting AMD's Socket A CPUs along with DDR SDRAM. There were variations of the chipset including one with and one without an integrated GeForce4 MX graphics processor (IGP). ==Development== The nForce2 features two different southbridges, the MCP and the MCP-T. The two differ only in audio and Ethernet integration. The latter is equipped with two 100 Mbit Ethernet NICs (nV and 3Com 3C905) and the impressive NVAPU (SoundStorm) with hardware accelerated 3D audio and real-time 5.1-channel Dolby Digital encoding whereas the first features one 100 Mbit NIC and an AC'97 audio controller. For audio, both MCP units were connected to an external codec chip, such as a Realtek ALC650. With the MCP, this codec provided all software-driven audio duties, while with the MCP-T it performed the DAC duties. Unfortunately, the external codec and unavoidably noisy motherboard circuitry (EMI/RFI) were detrimental to audio quality on even the MCP-T equipped boards, and as a result the nForce audio solutions were never of high fidelity unless the S/PDIF output (TOSLINK or coaxial) was used. The nForce2 chipset was remarkable for its advanced memory controller. It introduced a dual-channel memory interface to the mainstream market, doubling theoretical bandwidth. This was deemed necessary for the nForce2 IGP, with its GeForce4 MX-class integrated graphics, to be performance competitive budget solution. It was also important not to divert bandwidth, by sharing memory bandwidth with the most powerful IGP produced for Socket A, from the rest of the system. The Athlon's EV6 system bus was incapable of saturating the second channel, as this bus between the CPU and the north bridge was limited to the Athlon, AthlonXP, Duron, and early Sempron design to use a single 64 bit DDR channel. As a result, the second 64bit memory channel between the north bridge and the memory was almost exclusively available for the GPU. In dual-channel configurations of the nForce2 without IGP, the Athlon XP only showed gains of 5% at most in memory bandwidth intensive applications. Comparatively, in dual-channel configurations with IGP graphics, performance was demonstrably equivalent to dedicated GeForce 2 MX cards employing 64bit DDR memory or 128bit SDR memory. Among various fixes and refinements compared to the original nForce, nForce2 featured a fixed PCI/AGP clock, i.e. PCI and AGP frequencies will not change when changing the FSB. As a result, the nForce2 platform was known for its ease in overclocking AMD processors, and was a favorite for years with the overclocking community. It was also known that the chipset gave best performance with FSB and memory running synchronized, asynchronous operation delivered an unusual high performance loss. ==Refresh== In 2003, Nvidia released a refreshed nForce2, called \\"nForce2 Ultra 400\\". The nForce2 Ultra 400 and nForce2 400 represented official support for a 200 MHz FSB and PC-3200 DDR SDRAM, whereas the older nForce2 had only supported a maximum of 166 MHz FSB. Ultra 400 offered dual- channel support, while the plain 400 was single-channel PC-3200-capable. Both performed very similarly because neither had the IGP and again Athlon XP did not benefit significantly from the added bandwidth because the Athlon XP's bus was only capable of bandwidth matching a single channel of PC-3200. The new chipset again was partnered with several different southbridges, including one with (MCP-T) and one without (MCP) SoundStorm and dual Ethernet NICs. In 2004 three new southbridges were introduced: MCP-S integrated Serial ATA, MCP-RAID had additional RAID-functions and MCP-Gb featured Gigabit Ethernet. These newer southbridges did not integrate the SoundStorm unit nor the dual-Ethernet capabilities of the MCP-T. ==SoundStorm== The SoundStorm audio system was one of the first consumer computer audio products to offer real time Dolby Digital 5.1 encoding. This meant that one could play games or music and output them as a 5.1 stream digitally to an external decoding speaker system. This solves a common problem with most digital sound solutions of having to hook up both digital and analog connections at the same time so you can have surround sound in both games (using the analog connections) and movies (using the digital connection). Only recently has Dolby Digital live allowed competitors such as Creative's x-fi line up to offer real time DD 5.1 encoding. Some see the passing of SoundStorm as a classic example of the bottom dollar approach to building computers sweeping the PC industry, with component quality being gradually eroded, in favor of pricing considerations. SoundStorm was good competition for Creative Labs during its time, but did suffer from driver issues and performance problems. Many computer owners also had their own discrete audio solutions, such as the popular Creative Audigy series, the VIA Envy24, or various Turtle Beach boards, among other high end solutions offering superior analog quality. This made the NVAPU/SoundStorm a niche product in a market where keeping board costs low is essential to sales volume. SoundStorm/NVAPU's existence was a direct result of Xbox development, with the APU being directly related to the technology used in Microsoft's console. As the technology aged and consumers and OEMs showed a lack of interest in purchasing the more expensive but higher quality chipsets, Nvidia did not see reason to justify further R&D; expenditures. ==See also== * Comparison of Nvidia chipsets == External links == * Nvidia: nForce2 * NVIDIA nForce Platform Processors * Anandtech: Nvidia nForce2 Preview * Anandtech: Nvidia's nForce2 Performance Review * Anandtech: Nvidia's nForce2 Part II: Diving Deeper Category:Nvidia chipsets pt:NForce ","title":"NForce2"},{"id":"526417","text":"Seminole County is the name of several counties in the United States: *Seminole County, Florida *Seminole County, Georgia *Seminole County, Oklahoma ","title":"Seminole County"},{"id":"526427","text":"The Efficeon processor is Transmeta's second-generation 256-bit VLIW design released 2004 which employs a software engine (Code Morphing Software, aka CMS) to convert code written for x86 processors to the native instruction set of the chip. Like its predecessor, the Transmeta Crusoe (a 128-bit VLIW architecture), Efficeon stresses computational efficiency, low power consumption, and a low thermal footprint. Efficeon most closely mirrors the feature set of Intel Pentium 4 processors, although, like AMD Opteron processors, it supports a fully integrated memory controller, a HyperTransport IO bus, and the NX bit, or no-execute x86 extension to PAE mode. NX bit support is available starting with CMS version 6.0.4. Efficeon's computational performance relative to mobile CPUs like the Intel Pentium M is thought to be lower, although little appears to be published about the relative performance of these competing processors. Efficeon came in two package types: a 783- and a 592-contact ball grid array. Its power consumption is moderate (with some consuming as little as 3 watts at 1 GHz and 7 watts at 1.5 GHz), so it can be passively cooled. Two generations of this chip were produced. The first generation (TM8600) was manufactured using a TSMC 0.13 micrometre process and produced at speeds up to 1.2 GHz. The second generation (TM8800 and TM8820) was manufactured using a Fujitsu 90 nm process and produced at speeds ranging from 1 GHz to 1.7 GHz. Internally, the Efficeon has two arithmetic logic units, two load/store/add units, two execute units, two floating- point/MMX/SSE/SSE2 units, one branch prediction unit, one alias unit, and one control unit. The VLIW core can execute a 256-bit VLIW instruction per cycle, which is called a molecule and has room to store eight 32-bit instructions (called atoms) per cycle. The Efficeon has a 128 KB L1 instruction cache, a 64 KB L1 data cache and a 1 MB L2 cache. All caches are on die. Additionally the Efficeon CMS (code morphing software) reserves a small portion of main memory (typically 32 MB) for its translation cache of dynamically translated x86 instructions. ==Products== 1 GHz Efficeon TM8600 used on Sharp Mebius MURAMASA / PC-MM2 * Elitegroup A532 * Hewlett-Packard ThinClient T5710 * Microsoft FlexGo ComputerMicrosoft brings Vista to developing world PCs (first generation) * Orion Multisystem Cluster Workstation * Sharp Actius MM20, MP30, MP70G * Sharp Mebius Muramasa PC-MM2, PC-CV50F ==References== ==External links== *Transmeta Microprocessor Technology *Efficeon TM8600 Product Sheet *Efficeon TM8300/8600 Product Brief *Efficeon TM8800 Product Sheet Category:Embedded microprocessors Category:Microprocessors Category:Very long instruction word computing Category:X86 microprocessors ","title":"Transmeta Efficeon"},{"id":"526437","text":"John Coprario (c. 1570 - 1626), also known as Giovanni Coprario or Coperario, was an English composer and viol player. According to later commentators such as John Playford and Roger North, he changed his name from either Cowper or Cooper to Coperario in the early 17th century (at least as early as February 1601), though he himself spelled his name \\"John Coprario\\". Anthony Wood said he changed his name after an extended visit to Italy, and though he is documented as having visited the Low Countries in 1603, evidence confirming his presence in Italy has not been found.Christopher D.S. Field, \\"Coprario [Coperario, Cooper, Cowper], John [Giovanni]\\", The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, second edition, edited by Stanley Sadie and John Tyrrell (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001). From 1622 he served and may have taught the Prince of Wales, for whom he continued to work upon his succession as Charles I. His longtime patron was Edward Seymour, Earl of Hertford, for whom, according to Thomas Fuller's The History of the Worthies of England (1662), he taught William Lawes.John Irving, \\"Coprario, John\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, 60 vols., edited by H. C. G. (Henry Colin Gray) Matthew Brian Harrison (London and New York: Oxford University Press, 2004). . Among Coprario's works are fantasias, suites and other works for viols and violins, and two collections of songs, Funeral Teares (1606) and Songs of Mourning: Bewailing the Untimely Death of Prince Henry (1613). He also penned a treatise on composition, Rules how to Compose. According to Ernst Meyer, Coprario was a Londoner who Italianized his name as Italian music and musicians became more fashionable, and spent much of his life as a musician in the royal court. Ninety-six fantasias for three up to six voices, most of them in two Oxford and Royal College of Music collections, were known to exist by Coprario (as of 1946). Meyer also notes that most of Coprario's five- and six-part fantasias are mainly transcriptions, or imitations, of his madrigals, but that his fantasias for three or four instrumental parts are, formally especially, independently interesting. ==Referenceshttps://web.archive.org/web/20180106212629/http://www.geocities.jp/lyrischesuite/Coprario.htm Category:English classical composers Category:English viol players Category:English Baroque composers Category:Renaissance composers Category:1570s births Category:1626 deaths Category:People of the Elizabethan era Category:English music theorists Category:16th-century English composers Category:16th-century English musicians Category:17th-century English musicians Category:17th-century English composers Category:17th-century classical composers Category:English male classical composers ","title":"John Cooper (composer)"},{"id":"526447","text":"R√∂st√•nga () is a locality situated in Sval√∂v Municipality, Sk√•ne County, Sweden with 839 inhabitants in 2010.

He was a Native Hawaiian guitarist, claimed by many as the all-time best lap steel guitar virtuoso, and he is one of the most famous original Hawaiian steel guitarists, along with Joseph Kekuku, Frank Ferera, Sam Ku West and \\"King\\" Bennie Nawahi. ==Early life== Born Solomon Ho ªopi ªi Ka ªai ªai, in Honolulu, Hawaii, in 1902, into a large family, his birth making him the 21st child in the family. As was the norm in Hawaiian families, Sol's family taught him to sing and play instruments by the time he could walk. He was playing the ukulele by age three. By his teenage years the Hawaiian steel guitar had become his instrument of choice. He made his debut with Johnny Noble and his Orchestra. According to the Hawaiian Music Hall of Fame, at age 17 Sol and two teenage friends stowed away on the ocean liner Matsonia. They were discovered by passengers who were so charmed by their musical performances that the other passengers took up a collection to pay their fares. They landed in San Francisco, played a few club engagements, and eventually made their way to Los Angeles at the behest of Hoot Gibson to play in his country music band. Sol's friends returned to Hawaii, and Sol formed a trio with new associates. ==Sol Ho ªopi ªi Trio== By 1924, Ho ªopi ªi had moved to Los Angeles, where he formed the Sol Ho ªopi ªi Trio, with Glenwood Leslie and Lani McIntyre, including sometimes additional musicians, and he successfully performed in the local and then very popular Polynesian-themed night venues. His first recordings in 1925-28 featured often jazzy improvisation. He recorded his best known material 1933 to 1938, as Sol Hoopii's Novelty Trio, Novelty Quartette and Novelty Five on Decca Records and Brunswick Records labels, like the famous Hula Girl, Ten Tiny Toes, and many more brilliant Hawaiian hula and hapa-haole songs penned by the best Hawaiian composers like Johnny Noble and Sol Bright. Originally favouring the acoustic lap steel guitar, he switched to electric lap steel only around 1935 and developed an original tuning, in addition to the open A or open G tunings commonly in use at the time. He very often applied bluesy and jazzy treatments to the Tin Pan Alley standards, as well as to Hawaiian classics. His peculiar rhythmic, harmonic and melodic techniques influenced not only Hawaiian-styled musicians but also famed country and western swing steel guitarists, like Joaquin Murphy and Jerry Byrd. ==Christian ministry== In 1938, Ho ªopi ªi gave up his secular career to join the evangelist Aimee Semple McPherson, writing and performing songs for her tours. The Foursquare Church A rare video exists of Ho ªopi ªi playing traditional hymns on his lap steel guitar, accompanied by Christian composer Phillip Stanley KerrHymnary.org on the piano. Kerr mis-pronounces Sol's name as \\"hope-y\\". (Prior to, and for years after Hawaii's attaining statehood, many mainlanders mis-pronounced the state's name as How-Wah-Yah, leading to show biz jokes about the 50th state of \\"How Are Ya?\\" ) Titled Musical Moments with Sol Ho ªopi ªi and His Hawaiian Guitar, part of The Scriptures Visualized series, this was produced in 1942 by C.O. Baptista Films of Chicago.Billy Graham Center Part 2 of the video begins with Phil Kerr and Sol Ho ªopi ªi testifying about Ho ªopi ªi's Christian conversion, and contains a rare moment of Ho ªopi ªi doing a falsetto rendition of Kerr's composition I'm in Love with the Lover of my Soul. ==Steel guitar history== Some historians credit Joseph Kekuku with inventing the Hawaiian steel guitar about 1889 from an acoustic Spanish guitar. Hawaiian Steel Guitar Association This was long before Ho ªopi ªi's time. As far as the electrified lap steel, Philip Kerr mentions in the 1942 Baptista video that Ho ªopi ªi \\"was the originator of this electric guitar that he's playing.\\" Ho ªopi ªi himself does not make that claim on camera and Kerr may have been saying that Ho ªopi ªi designed or made that particular guitar in his possession. However, the claim comes up again in 1950, in a Florida Newspaper announcing, \\"Sol Hoopii, king of the Hawaiian guitar and originator of the electric guitar...\\" as part of the entertainment line-up for a church anniversary. The electric lap steel guitar, in fact, was not invented by Ho ªopi ªi, but he was acquainted with its inventor, George Beauchamp, in Los Angeles. Beauchamp was a steel player who collaborated with violin repairman John Dopyera to attempt to build a steel guitar that was louder. Dopyera and Beauchamp developed a non-electric guitar prototype with a metal resonator, a large metal cone placed under the guitar bridge. They sought investors for a new company to manufacture and sell the resonator guitar. To promote their invention, they organized a lavish party hosted by millionaire Ted Kleinmeyer and asked Sol Ho ªopi ªi to demonstrate the instrument. Years later, after splitting with Dopyera, Beauchamp independently invented the first electric guitar (a lap steel), and received the patent on August 10, 1937. ==Final days and death== For the last few years of his life Ho ªopi ªi was blind, but he continued to play, compose, and teach. Solomon Ho ªopi ªi Ka ªai ªai died November 16, 1953. His place of death has been listed alternately as Los Angeles, California, or Seattle, Washington. Bud Tutmarc, a Christian Hawaiian steel guitar player based in Seattle, was a close personal friend of Sol's and stated that Sol died in Seattle. On May 27, 1953, only 6 months before Sol's death, the two friends recorded a live Seattle performance of Indiana March (Sol on steel guitar); a three-in-one gospel medley (Sol and Bud steel guitar duet) - Mansion Over the Hilltop, It Is No Secret and Aloha Oe; a medley of At Calvary and Power In The Blood (Sol solo ukulele instrumental); and I'll Go With Him (ukulele and Sol vocals). Tutmarc died December 4, 2006, and his web site photo page has a snapshot of Sol and Bud having what looks like a one-on-one jam session. (photo #6 of the \\"Middle Years\\" gallery) Ho ªopi ªi is buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills).

On June 30, 2000, Bell Atlantic acquired GTE to form Verizon Communications. NYNEX also operated cable television and telephone services in the United Kingdom, with offices in Waterlooville (Hampshire), Baguley (Manchester), Shoreham-by-Sea (West Sussex), Leatherhead (Surrey) and Antrim (Northern Ireland). The assets belonging to the United Kingdom of NYNEX were merged with the subsidiary of Cable & Wireless, Mercury Communications, in October 1996, as well as cable operators Vid√©otron and Bell Cablemedia, and renamed as Cable & Wireless Communications. Cable & Wireless's cable assets were sold to NTL in May 2000. In March 2006, NTL merged with Telewest, and later re branded on February 8, 2007 as Virgin Media. ==Criticism== A major complaint of NYNEX was its reputation of poor customer service and low reliability. During its era, long term issues regarding corrupt and faulty business practices, phones frequently breaking down, and missed repair appointments were reported. The company also had a very poor habit of failing to fully meet the goals it promised for its customers. This eventually led NYNEX to a $4.1 million fine for lack of service in August 1996. A bigger complication, however, was the difficulty of contacting customer support whenever help was needed. Many NYNEX customers have witnessed filing countless complaints to the company, only to find out that none of them were being responded to. To numerous NYNEX customers, this was not an issue that happened only a few times, but rather, on a regular basis. In June 1995, the state of New York first proposed a turnaround plan that was meant to help NYNEX improve its customer service, but it was suddenly believed that it would not help NYNEX improve its poor service record, and that the rate reductions proposed by the plan would be too inconsistent. ==See also== *Western Electric *Bell Atlantic *FairPoint Communications *William C.

Coincidentally, that same week that Richard Hell (vocals/bass) left Television. After returning to New York, Thunders and Nolan invited Hell to join their new band, and Hell agreed. As Hell said, \\"I was fed up with Television because it was getting so pretentious...so I thought, this is perfect - we'll make a really good rock & roll band that's dealing with interesting subjects.\\" The three dubbed their new band the Heartbreakers. Their first gig was on May 30 of that year, at the Coventry, a rock club in Queens. (Tom Petty's backing band was also named the Heartbreakers, but they did not begin gigging until 1976.) The trio auditioned several candidates for a second guitarist, and soon added Walter Lure to the lineup. Lure, who had previously played with a glam-punk band called the Demons, played his first show with the Heartbreakers on July 4, 1975 at CBGB. The band quickly became one of the most popular and well-known underground bands in New York City, headlining shows at CBGB, Mother's (located across from the Chelsea Hotel), and Max's Kansas City. In the band's early days, each member took turns on vocals, with Hell bringing in songs (such as \\"Blank Generation\\") originally written for Television, and Thunders contributing new material as well. Lure began singing lead on some songs and co-writing with Nolan. The combination of the style-conscious Nolan and Thunders with the beatnik Hell and gangly Lure made for a visually arresting and musically powerful group. As Blondie's Clem Burke said, \\"You could call them the punk rock Beatles. Each person really stood out.\\" Although popular, the early lineup could not get a recording contract, in no small part due to the band's well-known heroin use - as vividly described in their best-known song, \\"Chinese Rocks\\" (which was actually written by Dee Dee Ramone with contributions from Hell). Live recordings of the Thunders/Hell/Nolan/Lure lineup were eventually released on the LP Live at Mother's, and studio demos were released in 2019. Although initially the band members shared songwriting and singing, Hell increasingly attempted to impose his will on the band. At a rehearsal in early 1976, Hell laid down an ultimatum - he would sing most of the songs in the set, with Thunders relegated to one or two songs per set. Thunders walked out, and Nolan and Lure followed; with all three united against him, Hell wound up leaving the band. His final show was on May 14, 1976 at the Rathskeller in Boston. After auditioning several bass players, the band settled on Boston transplant Billy Rath. Hell went on to form his own band, Richard Hell and the Voidoids. Replacing Hell with Rath solidified the Heartbreakers sound, firmly rooted in 1950's rock and rhythm 'n' blues, but with the energy, volume, and attitude of punk. Rath was a better bassist than Hell, meshing with Nolan to form a formidable rhythm section, and was also content with playing a supporting role in the band without seeking the spotlight. Now managed by Leee Black Childers, the band also consciously emphasized their New York street-tough image, abandoning the glam rock look Thunders and Nolan had flaunted in the New York Dolls in favor of short hair and '50's style suits. The first gigs with the new lineup took place on July 23 and 24, 1976 at Max's Kansas City and earned rave reviews. The band continued to gig regularly in New York City throughout the summer and fall, and played several shows in Boston in September. Despite Childers' efforts and a reputation as a must-see live act, no recording contract was forthcoming, a situation that became increasingly frustrating. Lure wrote that \\"the kind of deals being offered were laughable, sleazy 50-50 splits that the bands could never, ever hope to profit from.\\" Although the band regularly drew packed crowds at Max's and other venues, by this point Thunders, Nolan, and Lure were heroin addicts (Rath preferred methamphetamine), so money was tight. The band got what seemed like a break when the Sex Pistols invited the band to open for them on the ill-fated Anarchy Tour (the Sex Pistols at this time were managed by Malcolm McLaren, who had previously managed The New York Dolls). Arriving for the tour just as the UK punk scene was building momentum, the Heartbreakers quickly developed a following in and around London despite most of the shows on the tour being cancelled. As Childers said, \\"The Heartbreakers blew everyone away, for no more reason than they were just more experienced - they had their roots in rhythm and blues and rock 'n' roll...no matter how anarchic an audience thinks it is, if the bass player can actually play, and the drummer is Jerry Nolan, suddenly they're going 'this is GREAT'!\\" At Childers' behest, the band stayed in London after the conclusion of the tour in order to play more gigs and earn a recording contract. Sold-out gigs at London clubs Dingwalls and the Roxy established the band as one of the top groups in the nascent punk scene, and eventually they signed a contract with Track Records in the spring of 1977, earning a substantial advance and beginning work on their debut album. By this point, the band members' addictions were out of control, despite being enrolled in the British methadone program. Nolan later acknowledged that \\"everything we did revolved around drugs.\\" Recording sessions for the new album were derailed by drug use - on the part of band members as well as producer Speedy Keen - leading to innumerable attempts at recording and mixing at different studios. The first release from the sessions was the single \\"Chinese Rocks\\" b/w \\"Born To Lose\\", released in May 1977, which sold well despite being criticized for its poor sound. Nolan admitted \\"I think it's okay, but not great,\\" and Lure added \\"The record wasn't really up to par production wise.\\" Band members continued to attempt to remix the album at various studios in London throughout the summer of 1977, but the problems persisted. In the studio, the band could not seem to capture the power of their live shows - the recordings sounded muddy and lifeless, especially Nolan's drums. As a live act, at this point the Heartbreakers were second to none - a summer tour of the UK was very successful, with a New Musical Express review describing one gig as \\"the nearest thing I ever saw to Beatlemania.\\" In August, the band returned to New York City to play three nights at the Village Gate, their first shows in their hometown in nearly a year. Recalled Lure, \\"It was probably the best shows we ever played in New York, only because we were so tight from touring for six months. These now-legendary shows - which one observer called some of the best rock shows ever \\\\- were eventually released as a live album in 2015. Their debut, and only studio album, L.A.M.F. was poorly received (the title represents a phrase from New York street-slang and graffiti, \\"Like A Mother- Fucker\\"). The release of the album created conflict within the band, due to the poor quality of the recording and difficulty in the mastering process, the blame for which rests with producer Speedy Keen. Jerry Nolan left the band in the fall of 1978 because he did not like the mix of the album (Nolan had had a go at re-mixing the album himself, but was not satisfied with the results). The band reformed in 1978 for a few farewell shows at Max's Kansas City with drummer Ty Styx sitting in for Nolan. These shows recorded and released under the title Live at Max's Kansas City '79. The Heartbreakers' 1977 song, \\"London Boys\\", is a swipe at the Sex Pistols, in response to the Pistols' \\"New York\\", a put-down of the New York Dolls.. After their initial break up, the band reformed occasionally to play at New York clubs, and did a reunion tour of Europe in 1984 that led to a live album. Billy Rath left the band after the reunion tour and was replaced by Tony Coiro. Thunders and Nolan toured together in 1986 and 1987; Lure formed his own band, the Waldos, as well as occasionally playing with Thunders at New York gigs. The Heartbreakers' final show was on November 30, 1990 at the Marquee in New York City, with Coiro on bass. Although both Thunders and Nolan were in deteriorating health by this point, the show went well. == Post-Heartbreakers == Johnny Thunders died in April 1991. His body was found in a hotel room in New Orleans. While Thunders' death may have been drug-related, there is some controversy surrounding the facts of his death as the level of methadone in Thunders' body may not have constituted a fatal dose. Thunders also suffered from various health problems, with his autopsy showing evidence of malignant leukemia. In June 1991, a memorial concert was held for Thunders' family, at which Lure, Jerry Nolan, Coiro, and Joey Pinter played a set of Heartbreakers songs. Jerry Nolan died in 1992 following a stroke he suffered in hospital, while being treated for meningitis and pneumonia. He had been diagnosed with HIV several years prior to his death. Richard Hell rarely plays music live, concentrating instead on writing and spoken-word performances. Walter Lure had an unconventional post- Heartbreakers career, working as a stock broker on Wall Street. However, music continued to remained a big part of his life. He still performed in New York City a few weekends out of the year, and would do an international tour once or twice a year. Lure was diagnosed with liver and lung cancer in July 2020, which spread rapidly and he died from complications related to the cancer on August 21, 2020, (incorrectly reported as August 22) at the age of 71, peacefully in the hospital, surrounded by family. Billy Rath disappeared from the music scene after leaving the Heartbreakers in the mid-1980s, and he undertook a period of rehabilitation to recover from the effects of sustained abuse of drugs and alcohol. Rath then went on to study for a degree in psychology and a postgraduate qualification in theology, working as a substance use disorder counselor. After being persuaded to attend the Max's Kansas City reunion gig in September 2010, Rath reentered the music world and briefly fronted a new band, the Street Pirates. He died on 16 August 2014, aged 66. == Band members == * Johnny Thunders ‚Äì vocals, guitar (1975‚Äì1978, 1979, 1982, 1984, 1990, died 1991) * Walter Lure ‚Äì vocals, guitar (1975‚Äì1978, 1979, 1982, 1984, 1990, 1991, died 2020) * Jerry Nolan ‚Äì drums, backing vocals (1975‚Äì1978, 1990, 1991, died 1992) * Richard Hell ‚Äì vocals, bass (1975‚Äì1976) * Billy Rath ‚Äì bass (1976‚Äì1978, 1979, 1982, 1984, 1991, died 2014) * Terry Chimes ‚Äì drums (1977, 1984) * Ty Styx ‚Äì drums (1979, 1982, 1984) * Tony Coiro ‚Äì bass (1990) * Joey Pinter ‚Äì guitar (1991) == Timeline == ImageSize = width:900 height:auto barincrement:22 PlotArea = left:110 bottom:90 top:5 right:10 Alignbars = justify DateFormat = mm/dd/yyyy Period = from:01/01/1975 till:05/01/1991 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy ScaleMajor = increment:2 start:01/01/1975 Legend = orientation:vertical position:bottom columns:4 Colors = id:Vocals value:red legend:Vocals id:Backing value:pink legend:Backing_vocals id:Guitar value:green legend:Guitar id:Bass value:blue legend:Bass id:Drums value:orange legend:Drums id:Studio value:black legend:Studio_album id:bars value:gray(0.95) BackgroundColors = bars:bars LineData = at:10/03/1977 color:black layer:back BarData = bar:Richard text:Richard Hell bar:Johnny text:Johnny Thunders bar:Walter text:Walter Lure bar:Billy text:Billy Rath bar:Tony text:Tony Coiro bar:Jerry text:Jerry Nolan bar:Ty text:Ty Styx PlotData= width:11 textcolor:black align:left anchor:from shift:(11,-4) bar:Johnny from:start till:01/01/1978 color:vocals width:3 bar:Johnny from:start till:01/01/1978 color:guitar bar:Walter from:start till:01/01/1978 color:vocals width:3 bar:Walter from:start till:01/01/1978 color:guitar bar:Jerry from:start till:01/01/1978 color:drums bar:Jerry from:start till:01/01/1978 color:backing width:3 bar:Richard from:start till:01/01/1976 color:bass width:3 bar:Richard from:start till:01/01/1976 color:vocals bar:Billy from:01/01/1976 till:01/01/1978 color:bass bar:Johnny from:06/01/1979 till:08/01/1979 color:vocals width:3 bar:Johnny from:06/01/1979 till:08/01/1979 color:guitar bar:Walter from:06/01/1979 till:08/01/1979 color:vocals width:3 bar:Walter from:06/01/1979 till:08/01/1979 color:guitar bar:Billy from:06/01/1979 till:08/01/1979 color:bass bar:Ty from:06/01/1979 till:08/01/1979 color:drums bar:Johnny from:06/01/1982 till:08/01/1982 color:vocals width:3 bar:Johnny from:06/01/1982 till:08/01/1982 color:guitar bar:Walter from:06/01/1982 till:08/01/1982 color:vocals width:3 bar:Walter from:06/01/1982 till:08/01/1982 color:guitar bar:Billy from:06/01/1982 till:08/01/1982 color:bass bar:Ty from:06/01/1982 till:08/01/1982 color:drums bar:Johnny from:06/01/1990 till:08/01/1990 color:vocals width:3 bar:Johnny from:06/01/1990 till:08/01/1990 color:guitar bar:Walter from:06/01/1990 till:08/01/1990 color:vocals width:3 bar:Walter from:06/01/1990 till:08/01/1990 color:guitar bar:Jerry from:06/01/1990 till:08/01/1990 color:drums bar:Jerry from:06/01/1990 till:08/01/1990 color:backing width:3 bar:Tony from:06/01/1990 till:08/01/1990 color:bass bar:Walter from:04/24/1991 till:end color:vocals bar:Walter from:04/24/1991 till:end color:guitar width:3 bar:Jerry from:04/24/1991 till:end color:drums bar:Jerry from:04/24/1991 till:end color:backing width:3 bar:Billy from:04/24/1991 till:end color:bass == Discography == ; Studio albums * L.A.M.F.

He graduated from Oxford University very early and went on to invent the power loom. Married to local Elizabeth McMac at 19, he was the brother of Major John Cartwright, a political reformer and radical, and George Cartwright, explorer of Labrador. ==Early life== Cartwright was taught at Queen Elizabeth Grammar School, Wakefield, University College, Oxford, and for an MA degree at Magdalen College, Oxford, (awarded 1766) where he was received a demyship and was elected a Fellow of the College. He became a clergyman of the Church of England. Cartwright began his career as a clergyman, becoming, in 1779, rector of Goadby Marwood, Leicestershire. In 1783, he was elected a prebendary at Lincoln Cathedral. During his time as a clergyman he published the poem Armine and Elvira in 1770, which was followed by The Prince of Peace in 1779. Although he became better-known as an inventor he was awarded the degree of DD in 1806. ==Power loom== Edmund Cartwright designed his first power loom in 1784 and patented it in 1785, but it proved to be valueless. In 1789, he patented another loom which served as the model for later inventors to work upon. For a mechanically driven loom to become a commercial success, either one person would have to be able to attend to more than one machine, or each machine must have a greater productive capacity than one manually controlled. Cartwright added improvements, including a positive let-off motion, warp and weft stop motions, and sizing the warp while the loom was in action. He commenced to manufacture fabrics in Doncaster using these looms, and discovered many of their shortcomings. He attempted to remedy these in a number of ways: by introducing a crank and eccentric wheels to actuate its batten differentially, by improving the picking mechanism, by means of a device for stopping the loom when a shuttle failed to enter a shuttle box, by preventing a shuttle from rebounding when in a box, and by stretching the cloth with temples that acted automatically. His mill was repossessed by creditors in 1793. In 1792, Cartwright obtained his last patent for weaving machinery; this provided his loom with multiple shuttle boxes for weaving checks and cross stripes. However all his efforts were unavailing; it became apparent that no mechanism, however perfect, could succeed so long as warps continued to be sized while a loom was stationary. His plans for sizing them while a loom was in operation, and before being placed in a loom, failed. These problems were resolved in 1803, by William Radcliffe and his assistant Thomas Johnson, by their inventions of the beam warper, and the dressing sizing machine. In 1790 Robert Grimshaw of Gorton, Manchester erected a weaving factory at Knott Mill which he intended to fill with 500 of Cartwright's power looms, but with only 30 in place the factory was burnt down, probably as an act of arson inspired by the fears of hand loom weavers. The prospect of success was not sufficiently promising to induce its re- erection. In 1809 Cartwright obtained a grant of ¬£10,000 from parliament for his invention. In May 1821, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. ==Other inventions== Ropemaking machine of Edmund Cartwright Cartwright also patented a wool combing machine in 1789 and a cordelier (machine for making rope) in 1792. He also designed a steam engine that used alcohol instead of water. ==Family== Following the award of the parliamentary grant, Cartwright purchased a small farm in Kent, where he spent the rest of his life. Edmund Cartwright died in Sussex after a lingering illness and was buried at Battle. His daughter Elizabeth (1780‚Äì1837) married the Reverend John Penrose and wrote books under the pseudonym of Mrs Markham. ==See also== * Timeline of clothing and textiles technology ==References== ==Further reading== * * * ==External links== *\\"Edmund Cartwright and the power loom\\" ‚Äì at Cotton Times *\\"Richard Arkwright and Edmund Cartwright: Inventors of Important Textile Manufacturing Machines\\" ‚Äì at Grimshaw Origins Category:1743 births Category:1823 deaths Category:People from Bassetlaw District Category:People educated at Queen Elizabeth Grammar School, Wakefield Category:Alumni of University College, Oxford Category:Alumni of Magdalen College, Oxford Category:Fellows of Magdalen College, Oxford Category:English inventors Category:Textile engineers Category:People of the Industrial Revolution Category:English Anglicans Category:English male poets Category:Fellows of the Royal Society ","title":"Edmund Cartwright"},{"id":"526468","text":"Sosondowah, illustration by Frederick Richardson for The Red Indian Fairy Book (Frances Jenkins Olcott) The Iroquois mythic hero Sosondowah was a great hunter known for stalking a supernatural elk, Oh-je-a-neh-doh.

A gold medal is a medal awarded for highest achievement in a non-military field. Its name derives from the use of at least a fraction of gold in form of plating or alloying in its manufacture. Since the eighteenth century, gold medals have been awarded in the arts, for example, by the Royal Danish Academy, usually as a symbol of an award to give an outstanding student some financial freedom. Others offer only the prestige of the award. Many organizations now award gold medals either annually or extraordinarily, including UNESCO and various academic societies. While some gold medals are solid gold, others are gold-plated or silver-gilt, like those of the Olympic Games, the Lorentz Medal, the United States Congressional Gold Medal and the Nobel Prize medal. Nobel Prize medals consist of 18 karat green gold plated with 24 karat gold. Before 1980 they were struck in 23 karat gold. ==Military origins== Before the establishment of standard military awards, e.g., the Medal of Honor, it was common practice to have a medal specially created to provide national recognition for a significant military or naval victory or accomplishment. In the United States, Congress would enact a resolution asking the President to reward those responsible. The commanding officer would receive a gold medal and his officers silver medals. ==Competition medals== A medal on a ribbon designed to be worn around the winner's neck. Medals have historically been given as prizes in various types of competitive activities, especially athletics. Traditionally, medals are made of the following metals: # Gold (or another yellow metal, e.g., brass) # Silver (or another grey metal, e.g., steel) # Bronze Occasionally, Platinum medals can be awarded. These metals designate the first three Ages of Man in Greek mythology: the Golden Age, when men lived among the gods, the Silver Age, where youth lasted a hundred years, and the Bronze Age, the era of heroes. The custom of awarding the sequence of gold, silver, and bronze medals for the first three highest achievers dates from at least the 19th century, with the National Association of Amateur Athletes in the United States awarding such medals as early as 1884.Brooklyn Eagle, 15 August 1884 \\"Preparing for the Championship\\" This standard was adopted for Olympic competition at the 1904 Summer Olympics. At the 1896 event, silver was awarded to winners and bronze to runners-up, while at 1900 other prizes were given, not medals. ==Olympic Games== At the 1896 Summer Olympics, the winners received a silver medal. Since 1904, the winners receive a gold medal, the second-place finishers receive a silver medal and the third-place finishers receive a bronze medal. At the modern Olympic Games, winners of a sporting discipline receive a gold medal in recognition of their achievement. At the Ancient Olympic Games only one winner per event was crowned with kotinos, an olive wreath made of wild olive leaves from a sacred tree near the temple of Zeus at Olympia. Aristophanes in Plutus makes a remark why victorious athletes are crowned with wreath made of wild olive instead of gold.Aristophanes, Plutus, 585. Herodotus describes a story that explains why there were only a few Greek men at the Battle of Thermopylae since \\"all other men were participating in the Olympic Games\\" and that the prize for the winner was \\"an olive-wreath\\". When Tigranes, an Armenian general learned this, he uttered to his leader: \\"Good heavens! what kind of men are these against whom you have brought us to fight? Men who do not compete for possessions, but for honour\\".Herodotus, The Histories, Hdt. 8.26 Hence medals were not awarded at the ancient Olympic Games. At the 1896 Summer Olympics, winners received a silver medal and the second-place finisher received a bronze medal. In 1900, most winners received cups or trophies instead of medals. The next three Olympics (1904, 1908, 1912) awarded the winners solid gold medals, but the medals themselves were smaller. The use of gold rapidly declined with the onset of the First World War and also with the onset of the Second World War. The last series of Olympic medals to be made of solid gold were awarded at the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm, Sweden. Olympic gold medals are required to be made from at least 92.5% silver, and must contain a minimum of 6 grams of gold. All Olympic medals must be at least 60mm in diameter and 3mm thick. Minting the medals is the responsibility of the Olympic host. From 1928 through 1968 the design was always the same: the obverse showed a generic design by Florentine artist Giuseppe Cassioli of Greek goddess Nike with Rome's Colloseum in the background and text naming the host city; the reverse showed another generic design of Nike saluting an Olympic champion. From the 1972 Summer Olympics through 2000, Cassioli's design (or a slight modification) remained on the obverse with a custom design by the host city on the reverse. Noting that Cassioli's design showed a Roman amphitheater for what originally were Greek games, a new obverse design was commissioned for the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. For the 2008 Beijing Olympics medals had a diameter of 70mm and were 6mm thick, with the front displaying a winged figure of victory and the back showed a Beijing Olympics symbol surrounded by an inset jade circle. Winter Olympics medals have been of more varied design. The silver and bronze medals have always borne the same designs. ==Other gold medal awards== The award of a gold medal, often coupled with the award of silver and bronze medals to the next place finishers, has been adopted in other sports competitions and in other competitive fields, such as music and writing, as well as some competitive games. Typically bronze medals are awarded only to third place, but in some contests there is some variety, such as International barbershop music contests where bronze medals are awarded for third, fourth, and fifth place. ==See also== * List of gold medal awards ==Notes and references== ==External links== *Medals: Going For Gold! - Minerals Council of Australia *Royal Canadian Mint Interactive 3D Tour of the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympic Medals Category:Numismatics Category:Sports terminology Category:Award items Category:Olympic medals Medal de:Medaille#Sportmedaillen ","title":"Gold medal"},{"id":"526502","text":"The Canadian Wheat Board () was a marketing board for wheat and barley in Western Canada. Established by the Parliament of Canada on 5 July 1935, its operation was governed by the Canadian Wheat Board Act as a mandatory producer marketing system for wheat and barley in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and a small part of British Columbia. It was illegal for any farmer in areas under the CWB's jurisdiction to sell their wheat and barley through any other channel than the CWB. Although often called a monopoly, it was actually a monopsony since it was the only buyer of wheat and barley. It was a marketing agency acting on behalf of Western Canadian farmers, passing all profits from its operation back to farmers. Its market power over wheat and barley marketing was referred to as the \\"Single Desk\\". Amid criticism, the Canadian Wheat Board's Single Desk marketing power officially ended on 1 August 2012 as a result of Bill C-18, also known as the Marketing Freedom for Grain Farmers Act, which was tabled by the Harper government and passed in December 2011. The Canadian Wheat Board changed its name to simply CWB, reflecting its changed status. CWB continued to operate as a grain company, although the bill also set a timeline for the eventual privatization of CWB. On 15 April 2015, it was announced that a 50.1% majority stake in CWB would be acquired by Global Grain Group, a joint venture of Bunge Limited and the Saudi Agricultural and Livestock Investment Company, for $250 million. CWB was combined with the grain assets of Bunge Canada to form G3 Canada Limited. The third-highest sales year for wheat industry in Canada was 2011‚Äì2012 when the CWB \\"sold $7.2-billion worth of grain to more than 70 countries, $4.9 billion of which was paid back to farmers.\\" ==History First wheat boards === By the early 20th century in Western Canada, grain purchasing, transportation and marketing were dominated by large companies headquartered outside the region, such as the Canadian Pacific Railway and the trading companies which dominated the Winnipeg Grain Exchange. Producers were deeply suspicious of the business practices of these companies and hostile to their positions of power. Farmers were impressed by the success of state-led marketing as it was practised during World War I. The government created a series of boards in and around the war, each with progressively more power to control the grain trade. The Board of Grain Commissioners of 1912 was purely for regulation (to supervise grading, etc.), but by 1915 the government had seized control of all wheat exports to help the war effort, and by 1917 futures trading on the Winnipeg Exchange was banned. In 1917, the new Board of Grain Supervisors was given monopoly powers over wheat, and fixed uniform prices across the country. Soon afterwards, the Board took over marketing of other crops as well. Farmers were worried that after the war, prices would crash and various agrarian groups lobbied Ottawa to keep the Board in place. The government relented by creating the Canadian Wheat Board for the 1919 crop only. Farmers got a guaranteed price for that crop, paid immediately, and later a further payment once the Board had completed the year's sales. This system of guaranteed prices and distributed income was extremely popular and when the Board dissolved in 1920, many farmers were livid. It certainly did not help that, \\"from a peak of $2.85 per bushel in September, 1920 [prices] began a slow and sickening decline to less than a dollar a bushel in late 1923.\\"MacEwan, Harvest, 103. This marked contrast to the stable prices of 1919-1920 Board seemed to confirm farmers' suspicions of market trading. === Interregnum (1920-1935)=== After the dissolution of the early board in 1920, farmers turned to the idea of farmer- owned cooperatives. Cooperative grain elevator operators already existed, like United Grain Growers, which had already been started in 1917. In 1923 and 1924 the wheat pools were created to buy Canadian wheat and resell it overseas. The Alberta Wheat Pool, the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool, and Manitoba Pool Elevators quickly became giants in the industry and displaced the private traders. However they did not hedge against falling prices (instead relying on provincial government guarantees), and during the price collapse of 1929, they effectively went bankrupt. The majority of farmers did not want the private traders to return, and now it also seemed impossible for them to own their own marketing companies, so the idea of a government marketing board was revived. === Revival and flourishing (1935-2000)=== The Canadian Wheat Board was re- created in 1935 with the aim of controlling grain prices, so as to benefit farmers devastated by the Great Depression. During the Second World War, the authority of the Board was expanded, and the Board was given the authority to set statutory maximums on wheat, oats, barley, flax, and corn between December, 1941 until expiry after the war. Membership was made compulsory for Western Canadian farmers in 1943 via the War Measures Act, now with the purpose of aiding the war effort. In April, 1943 the Board was also authorized to buy rapeseed and sunflowers. Between 1958 and 1970 the CWB was chaired by William Craig McNamara, and he managed to perennialise the CWB in 1965, which was until then subject to amendments by Parliament when they periodically extended the Board's duration. McNamara convinced Parliament to end the time limit in the Act, thereby creating a permanent Board. CWB control over interprovincial shipments of feed grains became a public issue during the grains crisis in 1969 to 1972 and was removed. Only non-feed wheat and barley remained controlled by the CWB.cwb.ca: History of CWB agric.gov.ab.ca: \\"Single Desk Selling: Some Relevant CWB and Operational Issues\\" (copy by archive.org) === Anti-GMO stance of the CWB (2004) === The Canadian Wheat Board was instrumental in stopping the genetically modified (GM) wheat of Monsanto in 2004. As a united voice for wheat farmers, the CWB conducted market research which showed that international markets did not want GM wheat and would reject wheat exports from Canada if GM wheat was approved, because of the risk of contamination. The CWB also surveyed wheat farmers and found many did not want GM wheat. The CWB presented research and the views of wheat farmers to the government. === Late operations === Hopper car with Canadian Wheat Board markings. The farmers delivered their wheat and barley to grain elevators throughout the crop year. The Board acted as a single desk marketer of wheat and barley on behalf of prairie farmers. Upon delivery to an elevator, farmers received an initial payment for their grain from the CWB that represented a percentage of the expected return for that grade from the pool account. After the end of the crop year, July 31, an interim payment and a final payment were paid to farmers, in addition to their initial payment, and so they would have received 100% of the return from the sale of the grain they delivered, less all overhead costs of the CWB. The initial payments were guaranteed by the Government of Canada so that farmers received payment even if there was a deficit in the pool account. Initial payments were set below expectations for the crop year, a risk factor that was built in to guard against the event that price expectations are not met. Prior to the December 2011 passage of Bill C-18, An Act to reorganize the Canadian Wheat Board and to make consequential and related amendments to certain Acts, the CWB was governed by a 15-person Board of Directors, of which: #Ten of the directors were elected by grain farmers in the western Canadian provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and parts of British Columbia; #Four of the directors were appointed by Governor in Council on the recommendation of the Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board;Canadian Wheat Board Act, subsection 3.02(1) #One was the President of the CWB, appointed by the Governor in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board with certain restrictions including that the CWB Board of Directors must be consulted on the recommended candidate.Canadian Wheat Board Act section 3.09 Upon the implementation of Bill C-18, the original elected board was removed and was replaced by four directors, appointed by the Governor in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Agriculture, as well as the president, appointed by the Governor in Council on the recommendation of the Minister. Until 15 December 2011, compliance with the wheat board for most farmers and elevators was mandatory under threat of punishable by fines and/or imprisonment.Canadian Wheat Board Act, Canadian Wheat Board Act, section 68 Farmers from Eastern Canada and most of British Columbia were not controlled by the Canadian Wheat Board and were able to market all their grain on the open market. The area of British Columbia known as The Peace River District fell under the jurisdiction of the Canadian Wheat Board. Bill C-18, the Marketing Freedom for Grain Farmers Act, reorganized the CWB to market grain through voluntary pooling. Durum wheat ==Quality grading system== Unlike the United States, Canada had a tight grading system established by the Canadian Grain Commission and enforced by the CWB. This enforcement made it \\"possible to extract premiums for higher quality grain that is not possible in the United States.\\" In an open market system Western Canadian farmers lose the benefits of a grading system. ===Reorganisation (2006‚Äì2012)=== Since 2006 when the Conservative Party came to power, Chuck Strahl, then Minister of Agriculture, worked towards the end of the Wheat Board's Single Desk, including the replacement of government appointees to the Board of Directors in favor of individuals who oppose the board's Single Desk, a gag order on Wheat Board staff, the firing of the pro-board President, and intervention in the election of farmer elected members of the Board of Directors. * December 2006 CWB Board of Directors election. Only one of five farmer-elected seats went to opponents of the Canadian Wheat Board's Single Desk power on the selling of Canadian wheat and barley internationally. Since there was only one incumbent farmer-elected board member opposed to the Single Desk, only two out of ten farmer-elected directors were opposed to the Single Desk. Nonetheless, the government appointed five members to the board; supporters of the board's Single Desk would have only an eight to seven majority. Doubts have also been cast by some on the results because Strahl, the Minister of Agriculture, removed upwards of 20,000 farmers from the voters list in the midst of the election. These farmers were disqualified for such reasons as not having delivered any grain to the Wheat Board in the past two years or not having produced enough wheat or malt barley to have generated significant enough income from which to live off. * December 19, 2006: Chuck Strah dismisses CWB president Adrian Measner, an outspoken supporter of the Single Desk. This was done by Strahl with the statement \\"It's a position that [he] serves at [the] pleasure [of the Minister/Government]. And that position was no longer his.\\" It was suggested that Measner had gone too far for refusing to remove pro-CWB documents from the Board website and also appearing at press conferences with opposition leader St√©phane Dion. The majority of the CWB's board of directors opposed the firing of Measner. * March 28, 2007: Barley Plebiscite. 62% of farmers vote to end the wheat board's barley Single Desk power. Legislation to amend the act dies on order paper when the September 2008 election is called. * February 26, 2008: Conservative government loses court battle over unilaterally dismantling the CWB because it was contrary to the Canadian Wheat Board Act. * December 7, 2008: Board of Directors elections.

Robson claims that, \\"We‚Äôre captive to the railways, and you can see how that‚Äôs turning out. Transport Canada is supposed to safeguard our interests, but they‚Äôre afraid to antagonize the railways.\\" Before the CWB was sold by the federal government to foreign investors in 2014, the CWB owned 3,375 CWB railway cars.Jake MacDonald's special report for the Globe and Mail covers a number of aspects of the CWB in depth. By 2014 CP was shaped by CEO Hunter Harrison and American activist shareholder Bill Ackman. Americans own 73% of CP shares while Canadians and Americans own 50%. In order to improve returns for their shareholders, railways cut back on their workforce and downsized the number of locomotives. Western Grain Elevator Association's director, Wade Sobkowich, argued that railways were increasing profitability by reducing capacity. At a time when grain farmers are competing with crude oil producers for rail cars, they are not succeeding in getting the rail cars they need. In 2014, even though CN and CP were threatened by Transport Canada with fines for not meeting the \\"minimum volumes under the Fair Rail for Grain Farmers Act,\\" the monetary penalties were not hefty enough to impact on railways that generate revenues of roughly $200 million per week. ===CWB and tendering process=== In 2006 the four top grain handling companies in Western Canada‚Äî Agricore United, Saskatchewan Wheat Pool, Pioneer Grain, and Cargill held nearly 50% of the primary storage capacity. According to University of Saskatchewan professor, Murray Fulton, \\"This level of concentration, along with a lack of excess capacity\\" gave grain handling firms market power to raise prices above the cost of providing the service. Since 2001 the CWB encouraged greater competition among the grain companies by \\"operated a tendering process for approximately 20 to 25 percent of the grain destined for export.\\" The grain handling companies had to enter competitive bids to the CWB. CWB obtained market power by selecting the best bid as one seller as opposed to a large number of sellers (namely farmers) attempting to negotiate the best price. Modern criticism Grain elevator in Wrentham, Alberta Arguments in favour of privatization believe that farmers should be allowed to opt out of the board. Others believe that they could get a better price for their grain than the board itself and would like to market their own grain. For many Western Canadian farmers, the argument over the CWB Single Desk was about personal freedom - the freedom to market their production of crops in the manner they choose. The Single Desk control of price and the ability of farmers to deliver wheat and barley created an interest in other crops, causing a surge in acres of canola and pulse crops - crops with no delivery or price controls. This led to a decline in wheat acres and an increase in other crops. Now, with equal delivery opportunity, relative prices are the driving force in making cropping decisions, leading to an appropriate mix of crops based on relative global demand. Some opponents of the board's Single Desk power suggested it should be replaced by a 'dual market' system. This was presented as a compromise where board supporters could continue to sell their wheat and barley through the board and board opponents could have the option to sell outside the board. From the standpoint of supporters of the board, however, this was not a viable alternative as a dual market would effectively end the board's Single Desk power and any perceived benefits that it may have given farmers. Opponents argue that because the perceived benefits farmers received from the CWB increases their land value, elimination of the CWB Single Desk would lower the value of their land. Lower land prices would make Canadian farmers more competitive but could also leave many owing more than the value of their reduced land. Retiring farmers selling their land could be faced with a much reduced retirement fund but new entrants into farming would be able to purchase land at lower cost. (This is all based on the theory that the CWB provided a net benefit to farmers, which was never proved.) Some CWB opponents have argued that much of the lower quality land is in close proximity to the US border and would be the first to realize the benefits of the US market. Support for the CWB In a September 2011 plebiscite (referendum) conducted by Meyers Norris Penny, 62% of CWB farmers voted that they wanted to keep the wheat board and its Single Desk power. Proponents of maintaining the CWB stated that the collective bargaining power of the wheat board gives farmers a better price than they would have if they were individually marketing to large multi-national corporations. CWB opponents disagreed, arguing that there was no evidence of better returns for farmers. At this time, farmers already had the ability to market all the crops save wheat and malt barley independently, meaning it is possible to succeed marketing grain without board oversight. This, however, may make farmers more susceptible to fluctuations in the commodity market and to focus more of their time on the business aspect of farming, rather than farming. The Wheat Board attempted to offer producers more options in its latter years - for example, farmers could sell their wheat with binding forward contracts to the Wheat Board that attempted to pay the same price that they would get for their grain in the U.S. Supporters of the board and labour unions believed the CWB gave individual farmers increased marketing power in a world market which got them a higher price than they would have otherwise gotten, not only through the efficiencies of scale, but as well by exercising oligopolistic marketing power on the selling side, especially for Durum wheat, although the evidence of this is weak or non-existent. A study conducted in the mid 1990s suggested that farmers gained on average a premium of $13.35 a tonne on wheat as a result of the board's Single Desk, although the study and its methodology was widely refuted. Supporters of the Single Desk feared that an end to the board would put farmers in a situation like in the early part of the 20th century where farmers effectively competed with each other to sell their grain, effectively putting them at the mercy of big agribusiness and the railroad monopolies, believing that would reduce farm incomes. The counter-argument is that producers of non-Board crops such as canola do not seem to have this problem.Canola Growers oppose being included in CWB single desk American complaints Although the Board was reformed to meet free market conditions under the North American Free Trade Agreement and the World Trade Organization Treaty, American producers continually complained. Despite numerous challenges and much posturing by the United States, the World Trade Organization ruled in 2003 that the Wheat Board was a producer marketing body and not a system for government subsidy although the decision has since been overturned. In fact, Canadian producers have almost no government subsidy while their American and European Union counterparts are heavily subsidized. The attacks on the Wheat Board were, at the time, one of the major irritants in bilateral relations between Canada and the United States. Western alienation The fact that the Wheat Board primarily marketed crops produced in Western Canada became a source of alienation and even Alberta separatism for many Western Canadian farmers. Farmers in Eastern Canada (east of Manitoba) and most of British Columbia (non-Peace River) were exempt from the CWB's Single Desk control of non-feed wheat and barley - Ontario has its own marketing board, but it is not compulsory. Calls for abolition of the CWB There had been calls by many groups to abolish the Wheat Board. Many of these groups took their fight to the Internet to spread their message and gain support for their cause. While many were focused on the Canadian Wheat Board, others concentrated on international wheat boards, the other primary target being the Australian Wheat Board, before the AWB itself converted to a private firm, leaving the CWB as the only significant agricultural State Trading Enterprise (STE) exporter worldwide, if one ignores Chinese State-Owned Enterprises (SOE). On 7 December 2008, CWB permit book holders voted in favour of maintaining the wheat board by electing four pro-board candidates with one marketing choice candidate being elected. Stewart Wells, president of the National Farmers Union, said \\"The message can't be any clearer\\".CWB Election Results Show Support for CWB Monopoly - Johnstone, Regina Leader Post, 8 Dec 2008 Others argued that the voter's list was flawed, as it included many small or part-time producers who may not deliver to the Board, as well as non- producers such as landowners whose livelihood might not solely rely on farming. In December 2008, the draft modalities text of the Doha Development Round was revised such that upon signing in its revised form, the CWB would lose statutory privileges such as the Single Desk within 5 years of the signing. ===Transfer of CWB to Foreign Hands (2012-2015)=== One of the aims of the Conservative government since coming to power in January 2006 was to end the Single Desk marketing power on Western Canadian wheat and barley. The Conservatives had been unable to get this change approved by Parliament because they held a minority of seats until the May 2011 federal election and all opposition parties supported the Single Desk. The Conservatives also lost a court battle to unilaterally dismantle the CWB without an act of Parliament. In the aftermath, Harper and then Minister of Agriculture Chuck Strahl stated their intent to continue with the removal of the traditional role of the CWB, particularly in regards to barley (which is generally a more corporate crop), perhaps through Parliamentary action.Stand Up For Canada, 2006, Conservative Party of Canada Federal Election Platform, page 18 After winning a majority in the May 2011 general election, the Conservative government announced its intention to remove the CWB Single Desk through legislation. In response, the CWB held plebiscites on whether to keep the Single Desk power on wheat and barley. The results were released on September 12, 2011; 51 percent of barley growers and 62 percent of wheat growers voted to maintain the board's Single Desk. Notwithstanding, the government removed the Single Desk on August 1, 2012 ignoring the plebiscites' results. In defending this policy, Agriculture Minister Gerry Ritz claimed the CWB plebiscites were seriously flawed and that the Conservatives' election victory gave them a mandate to remove the Single Desk. According to the CWB, the government advanced the timetables to Christmas 2011, prompting them to launch a protest campaign urging Canadians as well as farmers to speak out against the government's decision to end the Single Desk. Meanwhile, the government issued leaflets explaining what would \\"bring marketing freedom.\\" The Marketing Freedom for Grain Farmers Act instituted a timeline for the eventual privatization of CWB, requiring the board to formulate a plan by 2016, to be implemented in 2017. On April 15, 2015, it was announced that a 50.1% majority stake in CWB would be acquired by Global Grain Group, a joint venture between Bunge Canada‚Äîa subsidiary of Bunge Limited, and SALIC Canada‚Äîa subsidiary of the Saudi Agricultural and Livestock Investment Company, for $250 million. The remaining equity of CWB will be held by its member farmers. The sale to G3 took place while a \\"Farmers of North America\\" led group of Western Canadian farmers attempted to raise funds to purchase the CWB and keep it Canadian farmer owned rather than selling it to foreign corporations. The group was rebuffed despite having a higher offer, ($349 million?) on grounds that they hadn't raised the funds. (the time frame was artificially short for the kind of offer FNA was attempting). On June 12, 2015, the Department of Finance released http://fin.gc.ca/drleg-apl/2015/nwmm- amvm-0615-02-eng.asp draft legislation to handle the tax consequence to farmers, and to the Trust which will hold 49.9% of CWB in trust for farmers (proposed section 135.2 of the Income Tax Act). No news release was issued to explain the legislation.

The abbey is well known for its history and spiritual life but also for its local production of the Trappist beer Orval and a specific cheese. == History  First foundation === Entry to Orval Abbey via the guest house. Orval Abbey Ruins. The site has been occupied since the Merovingian period, and there is evidence that there was already a chapel here in the 10th century. In 1070, a group of Benedictine monks from Calabria settled here, at the invitation of Arnould, Count of Chiny, and began construction of a church and a monastery, but after some forty years, possibly because of the death of Count Arnould, they moved away again. They were replaced by a community of Canons Regular, who completed the construction work: the abbey church was consecrated on 30 September 1124. In 1132, a group of Cistercian monks from Trois-Fontaines Abbey in Champagne arrived, and the two groups formed a single community within the Cistercian Order, under the first abbot, Constantin. Around 1252, the monastery was destroyed by a fire; the rebuilding took around 100 years. In the literary field the monks of Orval did not much distinguish themselves. The only noteworthy writer was Aegidius or Gilles d'Orval, who lived in the first half of the thirteenth century. He wrote the continuation, to the year 1251, of the \\"Gesta Pontificum Leodiensium\\", which had been written up to the year 1048 by Heriger of Lobbes and Anselm of Li√®ge (Mon. Germ. Script., XXV, 1-129). During the 15th and 16th centuries, the various wars between France and various neighbouring regions (Burgundy, Spain) had an important impact on Orval. At one stage a foundry was established on the site. In 1637, during the Thirty Years' War, the abbey was pillaged and burnt by French mercenaries. In the 17th century, the abbey converted to the Trappist branch of the Cistercian order, but reverted to the Rule of the main order in around 1785. In 1793, during the French Revolution, the abbey was completely burnt down by French forces, in retaliation for the hospitality it had provided to Austrian troops, and the community dispersed. === Second foundation === In 1887, the land and ruins were acquired by the Harenne family. They donated the lands to the Cistercian order in 1926 so that monastic life could resume on the site. Between 1926 and 1948, under the direction of the Trappist monk Marie-Albert van der Cruyssen, the new monastery was constructed, and in 1935 Orval regained the rank of abbey. On 8 September 1948, the new church was consecrated. The abbey has many artifacts designed and produced by Camille Colruyt.https://editiepajot.com/regios/7/articles/2949 The ruins of the medieval buildings remain on the site and are available to view. == Abbots of Orval Abbey == * 1936-1950 : Albert-Marie van der Cruyssen * 1950-1966 : Vincent de Paul Sonthonnax * 1966-1967 : Rapha√´l Boulet * 1967-1971 : Fran√ßois-Xavier Hanin * 1971-1980 : √âtienne Gillard * 1980-1981 : Denis Debusschere * 1982-1984 : Jacques Bernier * 1984-1988 : Paul Barbe * 1988-1999 : √âric Dion * 1999-2003 : Matthieu Cauwe * 2003-2007 : Jean Kremer * 2007-: Lode Van Hecke == The legend of Orval == There is a legend of the abbey's foundation, purporting to explain the name '\\"Orval\\" and the coat of arms. According to this, the widowed Mathilda of Tuscany was visiting the site, when she lost her wedding ring in a spring, to her great distress. When she prayed for the return of the ring, a trout appeared on the surface of the water with the ring in its mouth. She exclaimed \\"Truly this place is a Val d'Or (Golden Valley)\\", from which the name \\"Orval\\" is derived, and in gratitude made available the funds for the foundation of the monastery here. The abbey arms show the trout and ring.

Weir served as the 15th Premier of Manitoba from 1967 to 1969. The son of James Dixon Weir, he was born in Hugh Bluff, Manitoba and was educated there and in Portage la Prairie. Weir worked as an undertaker in Saskatchewan, later returning to Manitoba where he became the owner of his own funeral home in Minnedosa in 1953. In 1951, he married Harriet Thompson. Weir served as chairman of the Minnedosa Hospital Board from 1955 to 1957, and of the Minnedosa Town Council from 1958 to 1959. He sought the Progressive Conservative nomination for Minnedosa in the buildup to the 1958 provincial election, but lost to Sid Paler. He later defeated Paler for the party's nomination in the buildup to the 1959 provincial election; there was no lasting animosity between the candidates, and Paler served as Weir's campaign manager in the election that followed.Winnipeg Free Press, 12 February 1969, p. 5. Weir was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in Dufferin Roblin's landslide victory of 1959, defeating Liberal-Progressive incumbent Charles Shuttleworth in the rural riding of Minnedosa. He was appointed Minister of Municipal Affairs on October 25, 1961, holding the portfolio until February 27, 1963. Weir was also Minister of Public Works from November 5, 1962 to July 22, 1967 and Minister of Highways from July 1, 1967 to November 27, 1967. He was re-elected without difficulty in 1962, and again by a credible margin in the provincial election of 1966. When Roblin moved to federal politics in 1967, Weir defeated Sterling Lyon and two other candidates to become the party's new leader. He was sworn in as Premier on November 27, 1967. Weir represented a \\"rural populist\\" wing within the Manitoba Tories, and spoke for the party's more conservative members who had been marginalized during Red Tory Roblin's time as leader. Weir's government kept spending increases to a minimum, and introduced a balanced budget without tax increases in 1968.Winnipeg Free Press, 2 January 1969, p. 3. Weir was skeptical toward the concept of medicare, and his government did not sign on to the program until 1969, one year after its introduction.Winnipeg Free Press, 29 January 1969, p. 4. He also opposed the introduction of official bilingualism, and attained national notoriety for his conflict with Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau over this issue.Winnipeg Free Press, 13 February 1969, p. 1. Weir also proposed reforms for the Senate of Canada. He called for all provinces to have an equal number of Senators, and for some Senate representatives to be appointed on the recommendation of provincial governments. He also recommended that the Senate be given more powers, including the authority to ratify international treaties.Winnipeg Free Press, 1 February 1969, p. 7. Weir called four by-elections in early 1969, largely to test his government's popularity on the bilingualism issue. Tory candidates were successful in three of these contests, and it appeared as though his government's stance had been vindicated. Weir called a general election for June 25, 1969, even though only three years had passed since the previous election. This turned out to be a strategic error, particularly after the New Democratic Party selected Edward Schreyer as its leader during the campaign. Schreyer was a youthful and charismatic figure from the centrist wing of the NDP, and his party was able to win the support of many centre-left voters (including those who had voted for Pierre Trudeau's federal Liberals the previous year). The NDP won 28 seats against 22 for the Tories, and Schreyer replaced Weir as Premier shortly thereafter. On election night, Weir told his supporters \\"The people have spoken. And the people are wrong\\". Weir stepped down as PC leader in February 1971, and retired as an MLA in September of the same year. He did not re-enter political life again. Weir died in the evening of April 17, 1985 of a suspected heart attack at his home in Minnedosa, Manitoba.\\"Former premier Walter Weir dies\\", Brandon Sun, Thursday, April 18, 1985, Brandon, Manitoba, Canada ==References== ==External links== * Walter C.

The lake island in its centre is known as Ren√©-Levasseur Island, and its highest point is Mount Babel. The structure was created 214 (¬±1) million years ago, in the Late Triassic, by the impact of a meteorite of diameter. The lake and island are clearly seen from space and are sometimes called the \\"eye of Quebec\\". The lake has a volume of . ==Geography== The crater in winter, as seen from space The reservoir is located in Manicouagan Regional County Municipality in the C√¥te-Nord region of Quebec, Canada, about north of the city of Baie-Comeau, although its northernmost part is located in Caniapiscau Regional County Municipality. Quebec Route 389 passes the eastern shore of the lake. The crater is a multiple-ring structure about across, with the reservoir at its diameter inner ring being its most prominent feature. It surrounds an inner island plateau called Ren√©-Levasseur Island. Mount Babel is the highest peak of the island, at above sea level and above the reservoir level. The Louis-Babel Ecological Reserve makes up the central part of the island. ==Impact crater== Manicouagan Reservoir lies within the remnant of an ancient eroded impact crater (astrobleme). The crater was formed following the impact of an asteroid with a diameter of , which excavated a crater originally about wide, although erosion and deposition of sediments have since reduced the visible diameter to about . It is the Earth's sixth-largest confirmed impact crater according to rim-to- rim diameter. Mount Babel is interpreted as the central peak of the crater, formed by post-impact uplift. It is one of the oldest known impact craters. Research has shown that impact melt within the crater has an age of 214 ¬± 1 million years. As this is 12 ¬± 2 million years before the end of the Triassic, the impact that produced the crater cannot have been the cause of the Triassic‚ÄìJurassic extinction event.Ramezani, J., S. A.

Rasbury (2005). \\"The Manicouagan impact melt rock: a proposed standard for intercalibration of U-Pb and 40Ar/39Ar isotopic systems\\". 15th V.M. Goldsmidt Conference Abstract Volume, p. A321. === Hypothetical multiple impact event === It has been suggested that the Manicouagan crater may have been part of a multiple impact event which also formed the Rochechouart crater in France, Saint Martin crater in Manitoba, Obolon' crater in Ukraine, and Red Wing crater in North Dakota. David Rowley, a geophysicist, with the University of Chicago, working with John Spray of the University of New Brunswick and Simon Kelley of the Open University, discovered that the five craters appeared to form a chain, indicating the breakup and subsequent impact of an asteroid or comet,Spray, J.G., Kelley, S.P. and Rowley, D.B. (1998). \\"Evidence for a late Triassic multiple impact event on Earth\\". Nature, v. 392, pp. 171‚Äì173. Abstract similar to the well observed string of impacts of Comet Shoemaker‚ÄìLevy 9 on Jupiter in 1994. == Hydroelectric project == Daniel-Johnson Dam, the primary dam on the Manicouagan Reservoir, supports the Manic-5 hydro-power station The Manicouagan Reservoir as it presently exists was created in the 1960s, by flooding the earlier Lake Mushalagan (Mouchalagan) to the west of the central plateau and then-smaller Manicouagan to the east, by construction of the Daniel-Johnson Dam. The works were part of the enormous Manicouagan or Manic series of hydroelectric projects undertaken by Hydro-Qu√©bec, the provincial electrical utility. The complex of dams is also called the Manic-Outardes Project because the rivers involved are the Manicouagan and the Outardes. The reservoir acts as a giant headpond for the Manicouagan River, feeding the Jean-Lesage generating station (Manic-2), Ren√©-L√©vesque generating station (Manic-3), and Daniel-Johnson Dam (Manic-5) generating stations downstream. In the peak period of the winter cold, the lake surface is usually lower, since the turbines run all the time at peak load to meet the huge electrical heating needs of the province. The surface of the lake also experiences low levels in the extreme periods of heat in New England during the summer, since in that period Hydro-Qu√©bec sells electrical energy to the joint New England grid and individual utilities in the United States. ==See also== *Manicouagan Uapishka Biosphere Reserve *List of possible impact structures on Earth *Wembo-Nyama ring structure ==References== == External links == * Manicouagan at Earth Impact Database * Manicouagan Impact Structure at Crater Explorer * * *Manicouagan Impact Crater from Space (2019 May 2) *Aurora and Manicouagan Crater from the Space Station (2018 May 29) Category:Impact craters of Quebec Category:Triassic impact craters Category:Manicouagan-Outardes hydroelectric project Category:Reservoirs in Quebec Category:Biosphere reserves of Canada Category:Lakes of C√¥te-Nord Category:Impact crater lakes ","title":"Manicouagan Reservoir"},{"id":"526527","text":"Adrian Stoop (27 March 1883 ‚Äì 27 November 1957)Adrian Stoop international record Scrum.com was an English rugby union player of Dutch descent. He played 182 times for Harlequins between 1901 and 1939, and won 15 caps for England. He was president of the Harlequins 1920‚Äì1949. The club's ground, The Stoop, is named in his memory. The Stoop, his name given to the ground His association with Harlequins lasted from his debut against Oxford University in November 1901 until 1950 when he ended his 30-year stint as president of the club. He played his last game in Quins colours in 1939, at the age of 56. He made 182 appearances in total, captained the side 143 times and scored 86 tries, being club captain for 8 consecutive seasons from 1906/07 to 1913/14. Stoop was born on 27 March 1883 in Cromwell Road, London. His father was Dutch and his mother was half Scottish/half Irish. He went to Dover College in 1896 and on to Rugby School in 1898, where he played for the school team, and then to Oxford University, where he was captain of the rugby team in 1904. It was whilst he was still at Rugby school that he was asked to join Harlequins. He had also been approached by Blackheath, who at the time were a bigger name than Quins, but he decided to accept the offer from Quins. In 1905, Stoop made his debut for England against Scotland and it was also against Scotland that he earned the last of his 15 caps in 1912. During this time he captained the national side twice, including the first ever international played at Twickenham in 1910. Had it not been for a broken collarbone in 1907 he would have added to his international appearances. Stoop is widely credited with revolutionising back play. Previously, the two half backs were designated as \\"left and right\\", but Stoop incorporated ideas already being used in Wales and New Zealand to introduce the concept of the Scrum Half and Outside Half. He used these ideas to great success for both Harlequins and England. As well as being club captain from 1906‚Äì1914, Stoop was secretary from 1905‚Äì14 and from 1920-38 as well as president from 1920‚Äì1950. He was also president of the RFU in 1932 and was a member of the selection committee. In addition to Quins and England he also represented Oxford University, Surrey and The Barbarians. He died on 27 November 1957, aged 74. He is buried at Hartley Wintney, Hampshire, where he had lived for many years. == References == * Immortal Harlequin: The Story of Adrian Stoop by Ian Cooper (2004) Category:1883 births Category:1957 deaths Category:People from Kensington Category:English rugby union players Category:England international rugby union players Category:People educated at Dover College Category:People educated at Rugby School Category:Alumni of University College, Oxford Category:Barbarian F.C. players Category:Harlequin F.C. players Category:Oxford University RFC players Category:English people of Dutch descent Category:Middlesex County RFU players ","title":"Adrian Stoop"}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:B}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},I={class:"card-container"};function R(s,a,o,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return t(),n(h,null,[a[1]||(a[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâLife Quotesü•≥")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",I,[(t(!0),n(h,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,f)=>(t(),b(m,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:a[0]||(a[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):w("",!0)])],64)}const D=d(P,[["render",R]]),H=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/65.md","filePath":"guide/65.md"}'),x={name:"guide/65.md"},N=Object.assign(x,{setup(s){return(a,o)=>(t(),n("div",null,[v(D)]))}});export{H as __pageData,N as default};
