Formerly called the Mahsud Tahafuz (or Protection) Movement, it was founded in May 2014 by eight students at Gomal University, Dera Ismail Khan as an initiative for removing landmines from Waziristan and other parts of the former Federally Administered Tribal Areas, affected by the war in North-West Pakistan. During PTM's public demonstrations and sit-ins, several demands were presented to the Pakistani government and military, including punishment to the retired police officer Rao Anwar, a truth and reconciliation commission on extrajudicial killings in the country, presenting missing persons before courts, and removal of landmines from the Pashtun tribal areas. The movement is led by Manzoor Ahmad Pashteen, a human rights activist from South Waziristan. Other prominent leaders include Ali Wazir and Mohsin Dawar. PTM claims to be an unarmed and peaceful resistance movement working within the lawful boundaries of the Constitution of Pakistan. However, the Pakistan Army and several journalists have claimed that the movement is trying to create discord in the country along ethnic lines, as well as following a foreign agenda. The movement has seen strong support from neighboring Afghanistan, which traditionally has an uneasy relationship with the government of Pakistan. == Background == Formerly named the \\"Mahsud Tahafuz Movement\\", the movement rose to prominence in January 2018 when it began a justice movement for Naqeebullah Mehsud, who was extrajudicially killed in a fake encounter staged by the police officer Rao Anwar in Karachi. When the movement gained popularity among the Pashtuns in late January 2018, the word \\"Mahsud\\" in its name, which referred to the Mahsud tribe from Waziristan, was changed into \\"Pashtun\\" to refer to all Pashtuns. In November 2018, PTM launched a justice movement for Tahir Dawar, a police officer and Pashto poet who was abducted from the capital Islamabad and tortured to death, with his corpse found 18 days after disappearance in the Dur Baba District of Nangarhar Province, Afghanistan. PTM, as well as Tahir's family, demanded that Tahir's murder must be investigated through an international commission rather than a Pakistani one because the case involved two countries. PTM again gained international press coverage in February 2019 when the Balochistan Police allegedly extrajudicially murdered one of the leaders of PTM, Arman Loni, in Loralai. Protests followed which led to the detention of more than 20 PTM activists, including Gulalai Ismail and Abdullah Nangyal. In May 2020, after the assassination of PTM leader Arif Wazir, another wave of widespread protests was held during which several PTM activists, including Gilaman and Nadeem Askar, were arrested by Pakistani authorities. ==Pashtun Long March== ===Islamabad sit-in=== On 26 January 2018, the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement organized a protest march starting from Dera Ismail Khan. Pashteen started the march along with 20 friends, but many people joined it along the way, as it passed through Lakki Marwat, Bannu, Domel, Karak, Kohat, and Darra Adam Khel, reaching Peshawar on 28 January. Then after passing through Charsadda, Mardan, Swabi, and Tarnol, the march reached Islamabad, where a sit-in called \\"All Pashtun National Jirga\\" was organized from 1 February outside the National Press Club. The jirga condemned the murder of the Pashtun labourer and aspiring model, Naqeebullah Mehsud, who was shot dead by police force in Karachi during an alleged encounter, and the alleged state oppression against the Pashtuns. It asked the government to set up a judicial inquiry for Naqeebullah Mehsud, as well as for all the other Pashtuns murdered extrajudicially in police encounters. The jirga demanded to stop racial profiling of the Pashtuns in Pakistan, and to bring the Pashtun missing persons before the court of law, so that those who are innocent but held could be freed. The jirga also demanded Pakistan Army to guarantee that they will not abduct or open fire on innocents in the tribal areas, or use violence or collective punishment against entire villages and tribes, and that they will not impose the frequent curfews on the movement of locals even after minor incidents. Another demand was to remove all landminess planted in the tribal areas, which have resulted in many civilian casualties. The protesters said that since 2009, more than 35 people including children had been killed due to landmines in South Waziristan alone. The sit-in in Islamabad ended on 10 February, but the organizers of the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement announced that they would reconvene the protest if their demands were not fulfilled by the government. Advisor to Prime Minister on political affairs, Engr. Amir Muqam appeared in front of the protesters with the hand-written agreement from the Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi that included three clauses, agreeing to apprehend Rao Anwar, speed-up the clearing of Mines in South Waziristan, an intermediate college establishment in name of Naqeebullah Mehsud, and promised to addressed \\"genuine gravencies\\" raised by Jirga members. Muqam also told the protestors, \\"the way you held the peaceful protest is really commendable and others should learn a lesson to record their protests this way. I‚Äôll stand by you in trying times and you can come to discuss with me all of your legitimate issues anytime.\\" ===Main demands=== The main demands of PTM presented during the Pashtun Long March's gatherings in 2018 included, among others: #Rao Anwar and other police officers involved must be punished for the alleged murder of Naqeebullah Mehsud #A truth and reconciliation commission must be established for all the people who are killed extrajudicially like Naqeebullah Mehsud in alleged fake encounters by the law enforcement agencies of Pakistan #The missing persons who are imprisoned at unknown places must be tried in a court of law, and forced disappearances must be stopped #Landmines must be removed from the Pashtun tribal areas #Torture and collective punishment against entire villages and tribes in the Pashtun tribal areas, especially after a violent incident, must be stopped #The humiliation of locals at army checkpoints in the Pashtun areas must be endedPakistan's Manzoor Pashteen: 'Pashtuns are fed up with war', dw.com, 2018-04-11. ===Public gatherings=== PTM has held public demonstrations in Bajaur, Quetta, Wanna, Peshawar, Lahore, Swat, Karachi, Dera Ismail Khan, Swabi, Bannu, Cologne, Tank, Khaisor, Bamyan, Miramshah, Loralai, and Charsadda.In a rally in Peshawar, Pashteen used a racial slur.https://www.dawn.com/news/1401659 ==Media blackout in Pakistan== Mainstream media outlets in Pakistan have been largely ignoring the PTM, leaving social media as the primary channel for communicating with the rest of Pakistan and strengthening the narrative that the PTM is being ignored by the system. On 23 March, the PTM meeting was scheduled to be held in Peshawar University, but Deputy Commissioner Peshawar Islam Zeb, issued an order under section 144 CrPC, imposing ban on political meetings in University and stated any violation against the order shall be preceded against u/s 188 PPC and order will be exercised \\"for 30 days unless modified or withdrawn.\\" Later the meeting was held in Baghi-e-Naran, Hayatabad with 200 person attending the gathering. The movement's anthem is \\"Da Sanga Azadi Da?\\", which means \\"What kind of freedom is this?\\". Many Pashtun's have discovered their voice with this anthem and it encloses the various grievances they have from being caught between the militants and the military. On 26 April 2019, Mohsin Dawar tweeted that he and his fellow National Assembly member Ali Wazir were barred from holding a press conference at National Press Club (NPC) despite having prior bookings. Many prominent politicians including Pakistan Peoples Party's Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, Farhatullah Babar and Bushra Gohar condemned NPC for their move. The next day, NPC issued statement claiming that the lawmakers had not made any prior bookings. The Pakistan Army spokesman Major General Asif Ghafoor told the journalist Hamid Mir not to invite PTM members on media in response to a question by the journalist as to whether the media houses should invite PTM leaders on TV channels. On 29 April 2019, Asif Ghafoor said PTM would no longer be tolerated. \\"Their time is up,\\" he said of PTM at the press conference. ==Pashteen hat== The Pashteen hat (also known as the Mazari hat) has become the most iconic symbol of PTM, as Manzoor Pashteen regularly wears it at public rallies and events. ==Kharqamar incident== On 26 May 2019, PTM members including the Pakistani parliamentarians Ali Wazir and Mohsin Dawar protested in the Kharqamar area of Datta Khel Subdivision, North Waziristan. PTM claimed that the gathering had been organized by peaceful and unarmed activists to protest against the beating up of a woman by the military on May 25 and other human rights abuses in the area, but the military alleged that the PTM leaders instead wanted to ‚Äúexert pressure for release of suspected terrorists‚Äô facilitators‚Äù. As the military forces shot into the PTM protest gathering, more than 13 PTM supporters were killed and over 25 others injured. However, according to Pakistani military, five Pakistani soldier were injured as result of PTM members firing. Following the incident several PTM members, including Ali Wazir and Mohsin Dawar, were arrested by the security forces after the incident and curfew was imposed in the area. A day after this incident, the opposition parties walked out of the National Assembly of Pakistan in protest, and asked Asad Qaiser, the Speaker of the National Assembly, to produce Wazir and Dawar before the parliament so that they could explain their viewpoint about the incident at the parliament, but the speaker refused. On 1 June 2019, the Chief Minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Mahmood Khan, announced a financial package of Rs2.5 million for the families of the people killed in the Kharqamar incident and Rs1 million to those injured in the incident. KP chief minister announces compensation for affectees of Khar Qamar clash, Dawn.com On 14 October 2020, the government withdrew the Kharqamar case against PTM, and Wazir and Dawar were acquitted of all charges. ==Controversy== PTM openly criticizes the Pakistan Army and accuses the Pakistani state of violating the basic human rights of the Pashtuns, while the Pakistan Army has claimed that PTM is backed by foreign powers and their gatherings are \\"engineered\\". PTM claims that as a result, news organizations in Pakistan have been pressured to ignore PTM, and university professors have been forced to identify the students attending PTM's protest gatherings. Some Pakistani politicians and journalists also view PTM as working on a foreign or Pashtun nationalist agenda. However, PTM's leadership has openly declared that they are protesting through peaceful means within the Constitution of Pakistan. Founder of Aware Girls, Gulalai Ismail, was threatened with death by the Inter-Services Intelligence after she joined the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement and protested against enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings by the Pakistani state. After raising awareness of sexual assault committed by Pakistani security forces on women, Gulalai Ismail fled the country as police forces were on their way to arrest her. Leaders of PTM including Ali Wazir and Mohsin Dawar have been criticized for making controversial remarks about other ethnic groups of Pakistan .https://dnd.com.pk/statements-of-ptm-against- tajiks-in-afghanistan-and-against-punjabis-in-pakistan-need-immediate- attention/184198 Mohsin Dawar in a tweet stated that the policeman who arrested him was a \\"...Punjabi with a dirty demeanour\\".https://bolojawan.com/from-mohsin-dawar-to-usman-dar-heres-how- racist-we-pakistanis-are/ Ali Wazir has also been criticized by Pakistani media for stating that Lahore and Rawalpindi were \\"terrorist hotspots\\" demanding United States attack them in a speech in Charsadda.https://activepaknews.com/ali-wazir-calls-us-to-destroy-pakistan/ Based on these remarks Information Minister of KPK , Shaukat Ali Yousafzai demanded him to be removed from National Assembly proceedings. ==See also== *Waziristan *Killing of Naqeebullah Mehsud *Manzoor Pashteen *Ali Wazir *Mohsin Dawar *Enforced disappearances in Pakistan *Pakistan and state- sponsored terrorism *Targeted killings in Pakistan ==References== Category:2018 in Pakistan Category:2018 protests Category:Activism in Pakistan Category:Ethnic organisations based in Pakistan Category:Human rights organisations based in Pakistan Category:Pashtun nationalism Category:Pashtun rights Category:Politics of Balochistan, Pakistan Category:Politics of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas Category:Politics of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Category:Protests in Pakistan Category:Social movements in Afghanistan Category:Social movements in Pakistan Category:Insurgency in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Category:Censorship in Pakistan Category:Afghanistan‚ÄìPakistan relations Category:Human rights abuses in Pakistan Category:2014 establishments in Pakistan ","title":"Pashtun Tahafuz Movement"},{"id":"56564874","text":"Deon Jones (born January 4, 1993) is an American professional basketball player who last played for Fukushima Firebonds in Japan.

Clements served as Editor-in-Chief of Vogue Australia for thirteen years from 1999 to 2012, and is currently Director and Chief Creative Officer for luxury lingerie brand Porte-√°-Vie. == Early life == Clements was born on 23 March 1962 in Sydney, Australia. She grew up in the Sutherland Shire, a local government area in the southern region of Sydney, New South Wales. Clements has one older brother, Anthony. Their father passed away of a brain tumor when Clements was five years old. In her youth, Clements attended Sylvania High School. She described her desire to leave her hometown at an early age stating, \\"Not to dismiss it, but at that point I was much more interested in the band scene. I was interested in punk, in literature, in magazines, in popular culture, and the Shire wasn‚Äôt where I was going to get that from.\\" At the age of sixteen, Clements moved to the Sydney suburb of Darlinghurst with her mother Gloria. Describing herself as poor, Clements would often shop at disposal stores and op-shops in order to discover clothing and fashion. == Career == === First job with Vogue Australia === At the age of 23, Clements was working in a bookstore when she saw a job being advertised in the newspaper for receptionist at Vogue Australia. Clements immediately applied for the position and was granted an interview. The last of twenty different girls to be interviewed, Clements met with a woman described as \\"probably in her late 60s. Glamorous; white blonde hair, blue eyes, great legs, she was gorgeous. It was about six o'clock at night and she was drinking out of a tea cup, and I‚Äôm sure it was gin‚Ä¶ I loved her immediately and she hired me.\\" Clements began working behind the reception desk the very next day. Clements quickly moved on from the reception desk, taking on various jobs within the Vogue Australia offices. Describing her quick promotion, Clements stated, \\"I just put my hand up for everything. My key to success is to make yourself useful, just put you hand up for everything‚Ä¶ and you‚Äôll find what you shine at. Essentially I found I wasn‚Äôt very good at taking orders, but I was really good at giving them\\" Clements departed Vogue Australia in the early 1990s to move to Paris and work as a freelance journalist. === Harper's Bazaar === Clements returned to Australia in 1997 where she briefly worked as Beauty Editor for Vogue Australia before joining glossy magazine rival Harper‚Äôs Bazaar. Clements was brought on as Associate Editor for the magazine and worked there for just over two years from 1997 to 1999. === Return to Vogue Australia === Clements returned to Vogue Australia in 1999 to be hired as the magazine's Editor-in-Chief. Clements succeeded Juliet Ashworth who was former Editor-in-Chief from 1998-1999. Clements described her return to Vogue Australia as a challenge to rebuild its image following a demise in the 1990s. She stated, \\"Vogue was pretty broken at that point‚Ä¶ When I went back it took three years to build it back to what I felt was a standard that it should have been.\\" Early on in her career as Editor-in-Chief, while working on a November issue, Clements was faced with an almost empty roster of booked advertisements with mere weeks to go. With a goal of 120 pages of ads, the magazine had booked just one advertisement due to a staff error. This forced Clements to undertake a restaffing of the entire office. Commenting on her preferences for staff hires, she stated, \\"I liked to have a local staff, and an Australian staff. I didn‚Äôt like to use freelancers that much if I could help it.\\" When interviewing applicants for potential positions at Vogue Australia, Clements remarked how surprised she was by the number of young girls who expressed an obsession with a fashion label instead of an original style or desire to make things. She elaborated by stating that she was \\"always highly dubious because I wanted them to have a passion for art, for books, for culture, for literature, for dance, for theatre, for costume design... anything but, as a matter of fact, fashion‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt want people who were obsessed with labels, and I still stand by that.\\" Discussing her approach to management at Vogue Australia, Clements stated, \\"I learnt how to be diplomatic. I think most of my job was diplomacy. Diplomacy between staff members, diplomacy between management, diplomacy to clients, to creatives.\\" She commented that working with creatives was more rewarding than collaborating with any other worker due to their passion and vision. \\"They don‚Äôt care about the bonus, they don‚Äôt really care about the wage, but they care about the product, and if you can actually equip them with the materials, and the idea, and the vision, then they really can just run on praise.\\" === Sacking === In November 2006, Australian media mogul Rupert Murdoch's News Limited (rebranded as News Corp on 1 July 2013) acquired Independent Print Media Group's FPC Magazines which included Vogue Australia. News Limited placed management of the newly acquired FPC magazines (Notebook, Delicious, Super Food Ideas, & Vogue Australia) under its NewsLifeMedia branch. Clements was fired from her position as editor-in- chief six years after the News Limited acquisition, on 16 May 2012. She was called into a meeting with NewsLifeMedia CEO Nicole Sheffield who directed her to collect he belongings and depart the Vogue Australia offices immediately without offering an explanation as to why she was being fired. Clements left the office and went to have a drink at Bondi's Icebergs bar while news of her departure was announced. Clements was succeeded by Edwina McCann, former editor-in-chief of rival magazine Harper‚Äôs Bazaar Australia. === Current career === The day after her firing from Vogue Australia, Clements received a phone call from Louise Adler of Melbourne University Press who invited her to write a book about her career. Clements soon after signed a book publishing deal with Melbourne University Press to publish an auto-biography titled The Vogue Factor. The book was published in February 2013 and detailed Clements memoirs of her 25-year career at Vogue Australia. The book went on to become a bestseller in a number of markets worldwide, and Clements made an appearance on US talk show The View which was hosted by Barbara Walters to discuss the book.

It is based on the traditional story of the same name. The story is of Shim Chong, the daughter of a poor blind farmer. The peasant signs a deal with a monk to deliver 300 sacks of rice in return of his sight, but is unable to deliver the goods. Shim Chong agrees to be sacrificed to the God of the Sea on behalf of sailors who need to appease the deity. She is thrown into the sea and meets the god who praises her for her filial piety. Shim Chong returns to the surface inside a giant orchid that fishermen take to the king of the land. The king falls in love with her and helps her find her desperate father who has gone missing by organizing a feast for all the blind people in the kingdom. The Tale of Shim Chong was made when Shin and his wife Choi Eun-hee, who plays the part of Shim Chong's mother, were abducted to North Korea. The two were allowed to complete the filming of the underwater sequences of the film at the Bavaria Film Studios in Munich, West Germany. The negatives of the film went missing for some time, before Shin re-discovered them in Pyongyang. The Tale of Shim Chong has been likened with the work of Busby Berkeley. == Plot == Shim Chong is the daughter of a poor blind farmer whose wife has died. Her father visits a temple one day and is told by a monk that his blindness could be cured in exchange for 300 sacks of rice. The farmer agrees to supply the sacks, but soon realizes that he is not able to. Meanwhile, a group of sailors lament that they have angered the God of the Sea. The only way to appease the god is to sacrifice a young girl. Shim Chong agrees to be the sacrificial offering if the sailors provide the sacks of rice her father is missing and some money. Once the farmer finds out about this deal he unsuccessfully tries to stop Shim Chong. Shim Chong is taken to the sea in the sailors' ship and thrown overboard. The seas immediately calm. Shim Chong sinks to the bottom of the sea and meets the God of the Sea. The god has been waiting for her to arrive in his realm and praises her for her filial piety. In the underwater world, Shim Chong also meets her deceased mother. Shim Chong leaves the world of the God of the Sea by floating to the surface inside a giant orchid. A group of fishermen discover the orchid and take it to the king who rules the land. Shim Chong emerges from the orchid and the king falls in love with her. Shim Chong, however, can only think about her father who has gone missing. It turns out he had found a new woman, but the woman cheats her and takes all of the money that Shim Chong had asked from the sailors. The king helps Shim Chong find her father by organizing a feast for all blind people in his kingdom. When Shim Chong recognizes her father at the feast, he miraculously regains his eyesight. == Cast == Choi Eun-hee acts the part of Shim Chong's mother. == Themes == The theme is of suffering and filial piety. == Production == The Tale of Shim Chong was directed by Shin Sang-ok while he and his wife Choi Eun-hee were abducted to North Korea. It is in the genre of a musical film. The story is based on an ancient Korean folk tale The Tale of Shim Chong about a princess of a realm at the bottom of the sea. Shin had already made a film based in the story in 1972 in South Korea. The underwater world is populated by dancers in exotic outfits. Although they are masked, their way of dancing gives away the fact that they are Western actors. This otherworldly realm is contrasted with the kingdom on dry land, which is inhabited by people acted by Koreans. With the permission of Kim Jong-il, Shin and Choi traveled to the Bavaria Film Studios in Munich, West Germany, where they shot the underwater sequences of the film. Shin was helped in special effects by the team that made the film The NeverEnding Story. Shin and Choi's every move in Munich was followed by seven North Korean bodyguards. Nevertheless, Johannes Sch√∂nherr, the author of North Korean Cinema: A History raises the question why they did not try to defect in a city that was in the West, where it would have been comparatively easy at any rate. Instead, Shin and Choi returned to North Korea after the filming was complete. The film was released in 1985, the same year that he directed Pulgasari and saw the release of his film Salt. Shin sent the negatives of The Tale of Shim Chong to Kim Guh-wha, a Shin Film representative in Hong Kong to add Chinese subtitles. Kim was the man whom, as Shin later discovered, had handed him over to North Korean agents in Hong Kong in 1978. The negatives went missing at some point. Shin rediscovered the negatives when he visited Kim Jong-il's film archives in Pyongyang. == Critical response == The Gang's All Here (1943) choreographed by Busby Berkeley Paul Fischer, the author of A Kim Jong-Il Production likens it with the work of Busby Berkeley, calling it \\"an extravagant musical ... with fantasy creatures, expensive costumes, and underwater scenes\\". == See also == * Abduction of Shin Sang-ok and Choi Eun-hee * Cinema of North Korea * Human sacrifice * List of North Korean films * Simcheongga ‚Äì pansori (traditional musical storytelling) of the same story == References == === Works cited === * * * == External links == * Category:1985 films Category:Films directed by Shin Sang-ok Category:Korean-language films Category:North Korean films ","title":"The Tale of Shim Chong (film)"},{"id":"56565225","text":"Paracelsus is a five-part epic poem written by Robert Browning and published in 1835. ==Structure== The poem is split into five parts called \\"Paracelsus Aspires\\", \\"Paracelsus Attains\\", \\"Paracelsus\\", \\"Paracelsus Aspires\\" and \\"Paracelsus Attains\\". ==References== Category: 1835 poems Category:Poetry by Robert Browning ","title":"Paracelsus (poem)"},{"id":"56565230","text":"Inga Pa≈°kovska (born 20 January 1992) is a cross-country skier from Latvia.FIS profile Her World Cup debut came in 2017.

He served in the de Maizi√®re cabinet as the last East German Minister for Education and the Arts. After reunification he became Secretary of State for Sciences and the Arts in the regional government of Saxony. In addition, he served between 1997 and 2009 as President of the Central Committee of German Catholics (\\"Zentralkomitee der deutschen Katholiken\\" / ZdK). == Life == Hans Joachim Meyer was born in Rostock. He grew up, after 1945, in the Soviet occupation zone which was relaunched in October 1949 as the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic (East Germany). After successfully completing his school studies in Rostock he moved to the Berlin area. He attended the (East) German Academy for Laws (\\"Deutsche Akademie f√ºr Staats- und Rechtswissenschaft\\") in Potsdam between 1955 and 1958 but was excluded after six terms before he could complete his degree because he \\"failed to connect with the working class\\" (wegen \\"mangelnder Verbindung zur Arbeiterklasse\\"). The real issue, he later told an interviewer, was his commitment to the Catholic Church. His decision while still at school to join the CDU (political party) back in 1952, at a time when the ruling party was engaged in a robust campaign to take control of rival political parties, will already have drawn him to the attention of the authorities as a potential dissident in the making. For the next year he worked as an \\"assistant\\" at the VEB Lokomotivbau Potsdam-Babelsberg (factory) as the nearby rail-locomotive plant was known at that time. After that, resigning from the CDU in 1961, he was able to restart his university studies, now embarking on a course at the Humboldt University of Berlin of English and American Studies and Philology. His decision to select a subject that was seen by the authorities as less directly political was vindicated, in that this time he was able to complete his course, emerging with his university degree in 1964. He remained at the Humboldt as a teacher and senior research assistant between 1964 and 1982. He received his doctorate in 1971. His dissertation was, again, resolutely non-political: it comprised a semantic analysis of the modern English verb prefix \\"Up\\" when compared to related prefixes in English and German (\\"Semantische Analyse der modernenglischen Verbalpartikel \\"up\\" im Vergleich zu verwandten englischen und deutschen Verbalpartikeln\\"). Ten years later his habilitation, received in 1981, could have opened the way to a lifelong university career, had \\"events\\" not intervened. He was assigned to the Foreign Languages section between 1973 and 1977, becoming deputy director for education and training. Between 1978 and 1990 he headed up the Intensive Languages Training section at the Humboldt. He also held an appointment as Professor of Applied Linguistics between 1985 and 1990. During his academic career in East Berlin Meyer was engaged with the church. Between 1973 and 1975 he served as a member of the Dresden Pastoral Synod of the region covered by the German Democratic Republic. Between 1976 and 1982 he worked with the Pastoral Council for the Bishopric in respect of East Berlin. During the later 1980s the winds of Perestroika blowing cross from, of all places, Moscow, found a growing resonance on the streets in the German Democratic Republic, (even if the government was appalled). In November 1989 street protestors broke through the Berlin Wall, and it quickly became apparent that Fraternal Forces from the east had received no orders to intervene militarily. There would be no repeat of 1953 or of the tragedy of 1968 in Prague. A seemingly unstoppable series of events now unfolded leading to the country's first (and, as matters turned out, last) free and fair election. In previous general elections, turn-pout had always been recorded at around 99% of eligible voters and the proportion of votes cast for the ruling Socialist Unity Party had always been recorded at around 99% of votes cast. However, results in March 1990 indicated significant levels of support for various political parties, with the CDU and its centre- right allies winning 48% of the votes. Shorty after that Meyer received and accepted an invitation to join the new government headed up by Lothar de Maizi√®re, despite not being at this stage a member of any political party, and despite not having stood for election to the national parliament (\\"Volkskammer\\"). Between 12 April and 3 October 1990 Meyer served as the German Democratic Republic's last Minister for Minister for Education and the Arts. His responsibilities included participation as leader of the East German delegation at the All-Germany Joint Education Commission between May and September 1990. The commission was mandated to adapt an education system that would be implemented across a unified Germany. The commission's output was summarized in the Reunification Treaty (Articles 37 & 38) which came into force in October 1990 and was then implemented both at government level and on the ground. In August 1990 the East German CDU (party) formally merged back into the West German CDU from which it had been forcibly separated by the post-war division of Germany, and Hans Joachim Meyer took the opportunity to rejoin the party from which, out of \\"disappointment over the party's limited political options\\", he had resigned in 1961. Directly following reunification he joined the regional government of Kurt Biedenkopf in Saxony, serving between November 1990 and May 2002 as Saxony's Minister of State for Sciences and the Arts. == Awards and honours == * 2002: Honorary doctorate from the TU Dresden (university) * 2003: Honorary membership of the Saxony Academy of Arts and Sciences * 2005: Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany * 2008: Johann Walter Plakette * 2013: Hans-Olaf-Henkel Prize * 2015: Order of Merit of the Free State of Saxony * 2017: Order of St. Gregory the Great == Output (selection) == * 2015: In keiner Schublade ‚Äì Erfahrungen im geteilten und vereinten Deutschland (ISBN 978-3-451-32968-5) == References == Category:20th- century German politicians Category:People from Rostock Category:Humboldt University of Berlin faculty Category:Christian Democratic Union (East Germany) politicians Category:Christian Democratic Union of Germany politicians Category:German Roman Catholics Category:Linguists from Germany Category:Government ministers of East Germany Category:Ministers of the Saxony State Government Category:Commanders Crosses of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany Category:Knights Commander of the Order of St Gregory the Great Category:1936 births Category:Living people ","title":"Hans Joachim Meyer"},{"id":"56565300","text":"Roberts JƒÅnis Zvejnieks (born 22 November 1997) is a short track speed skater who competed for Latvia at the 2018 Winter Olympics. == References * Category:1997 births Category:Living people Category:Latvian male short track speed skaters Category:Olympic short track speed skaters of Latvia Category:Short track speed skaters at the 2018 Winter Olympics ","title":"Roberts Zvejnieks"},{"id":"56565380","text":"Tirumalai Krishnamacharya Venkata Desikachar (21 June 1938 ‚Äì 8 August 2016), better known as T.

Horizontal (axial) movements due to thermal expansion and braking loads are instead transferred to the fill adjacent to the abutment. The omission of the expansion joint removes a pathway for the penetration of chloride-bearing road salts to the bridge's sub-structure. In the United Kingdom there is a presumption that most new short to medium length bridges will be of the integral type. An early example of an integral bridge is masonry arch bridge. Some of the earliest examples of integral bridges in reinforced concrete were constructed as part of the United Kingdom's M1 motorway in 1959. == Description == Non-integral bridges incorporate at least one expansion joint (pictured) to accommodate movement An integral bridge contains no expansion joints, spanning monolithically from abutment to abutment. Movement due to thermal expansion and contraction or braking loads is accommodated by the end walls or abutments. Where intermediate supports are specified (e.g. bridge piers) these may also serve to resist thermal expansion movements. The omission of the expansion joint removes a significant maintenance and durability issue, as it serves as a point of ingress for road salts which allows the abutment, piers and deck soffit concrete to come under chloride attack that can cause degradation and eventual span failure. A 1989 British study showed that the majority of expansion joints surveyed in existing bridges had failed and allowed water (and hence salt) ingress. The movement experienced at the abutment in an integral bridge is an order of magnitude greater than those designed with movement joints. The size of movement depends on the stiffness of the bridge structure and the fill adjacent to the abutment (which is subject to compaction). The movement is largest in the upper portion of the abutment, where thermal effects are greatest. Highways England specify that integral bridges should be designed to limit movement to . Due to repeated expansion and contraction cycles the backfill adjacent to the abutment is subject to ratcheting, whereby the material's stiffness is increased. The maximum stiffness level is reached after around 100‚Äì200 thermal expansion cycles. == Types == Highways England recognises four types of integral bridge, defined by the construction of their abutments: *Frame abutments where the abutment acts as a retaining wall to the surrounding fill, connecting to the deck in a manner that allows for transfer of bending moments, shear forces and axial loads. *Embedded abutments, extending to a depth below the retained fill with restraint provided by the embedded length. *Bank pad abutments, designed to move horizontally to accommodate expansion and contraction of the deck. These must be of adequate weight (or a deck flexible enough) to avoid uplift forces due to differential settlement. *End screen abutments, which act only to retain the surrounding fill and transfer horizontal loads from the bridge deck to the fill. The vertical loads are transferred from the deck by means of a separate support system. The supports may be designed to take only vertical loading or accommodate the horizontal movement. Where bridge bearings are used on an integral bridge (as is often the case for end screen abutment types) the structure is sometimes referred to as semi-integral. == Use == It is widely accepted that short to medium length bridges should be designed as integral structures to minimise maintenance requirements. Highways England's Design Manual for Roads and Bridges (applicable to the whole of the UK and many parts of it, including the section on integral bridges, applying to the Republic of Ireland) states that all bridges with deck length less than and skew of less than 30 degrees should be designed as integral structures unless there is a compelling reason to do otherwise. == References == Category:Bridges by structural type ","title":"Integral bridge"},{"id":"56565514","text":"Lyulya kebab or lule kebab is a type of kebab cooked on skewers.

Vera Street, is a road in Quezon City, Metro Manila, the Philippines. It runs from Nicanor Domingo Street as an extension of Gilmore Avenue to the boundary with San Juan, where it terminates at Bonny Serrano Avenue and becomes Ortigas Avenue. == Route description == The land on which the street lies on used to be part of an estate owned by the family of Jose O. Vera, founder of Sampaguita Pictures and later Senator from 1946 to 1949. In the late 1950s, Mayor Norberto Amoranto convinced the Vera family to permit construction of the street through their property, part of a project to improve connectivity between Quezon City ‚Äî at the time the capital of the Philippines ‚Äî and the surrounding suburbs, particularly those headed to New Manila from Mandaluyong and Pasig. The family sold one hectare of land to the Quezon City government at a significant discount to facilitate construction of the road, and its completion enabled direct access to Quezon City from eastern Metro Manila without needing to go through side streets or Epifanio de los Santos Avenue. In 2004, the street was renamed after Vera by the Sangguniang Panlungsod of Quezon City. Today, Granada Street is known for being home to several parol (Christmas lantern) vendors which line both sides of the street, giving it the name \\"Parol Row\\". Also known as the Parolan sa San Juan (\\"Lantern Area on the San Juan\\"), selling lanterns here began in the 1990s, when Sampaguita Pictures crewmen made lanterns and sold them outside the studio premises to generate extra income. Several vendors sell their lanterns here from September to December every year, with some selling the rest of the year as well. The street is also a culinary destination, having held this distinction since the 1970s.

The citation for that award was: After the war, Brayne returned to the Punjab and in 1920 he married Iris Goodeve, a daughter of Edgar Goble. He became district officer of Gurgaon, some from Delhi, at a time when the area, comprising a population of around 700,000, was suffering greatly from a recent influenza epidemic, a failed monsoon and the return of soldiers from the war. To counter the deprivation, Brayne initiated what became known as the Gurgaon Scheme, in which he hoped to alleviate the plight of peasants in all its aspects by encouraging and facilitating the idea of self-help. He wrote several books about this, including Village Uplift in India, Socrates in an Indian Village, Socrates Persists in India, and Socrates at School, as well as one comparing rural life in India with that of England. The scheme was not a success. Clive Dewey argued, in his book Anglo-Indian Attitudes: The Mind of the Indian Civil Service, that Brayne's approach to rural uplift was bound to fail, because Indian peasants did not share Brayne's evangelical values ‚Äì not least his belief that poverty-stricken cultivators in famine-stricken areas could revolutionise their standard of living by working harder and practising thrift, without any assistance from the state. His conclusions, which were supported by years of research in Indian archives and by extensive interviews with Brayne's contemporaries, were accepted by several members of the ICS and have been endorsed by subsequent historians. Philip Mason, himself a former member of the ICS, and the author of the most famous history of the service, described Brayne as being More recently, Atiyab Sultan said that Brayne's interventionism had a \\"missionary zeal\\" and that his methods were \\"more prescriptive\\" than those of Malcolm Lyall Darling, who was another somewhat maverick British administrator in Punjab. One of Brayne's sons, Thomas Lugard Brayne, became embroiled in a controversy in The Times Literary Supplement and the Telegraph following the publication of Dewey's book in 1993. He believed that Dewey had seriously misrepresented his father, unreasonably portrayed the character of the ICS itself, and misled the Brayne family, whose collection of private papers he used. In his rejoinders, Dewey pointed out that when he asked for permission to use Brayne's papers, he believed that Brayne's Gurgaon Experiment had been a success, because he only had Brayne's vainglorious accounts of his own achievements to go on; and he only lost confidence in Brayne's form of \\"rural reconstruction\\" after the overwhelming mass of evidence showed how dismally it had failed. It was impossible, he maintained, to take Brayne at his own valuation. Brayne boasted that he could 'do anything with propaganda' ‚Äì and propaganda is what his work remained. At best, it raised the official awareness of the problems of the peasantry, without providing effective solutions. By 1937, Brayne was Commissioner for Rural Reconstruction in the Punjab and in 1940 he was Financial Commissioner (Development) there. In December 1941, he was appointed as a 2nd Lieutenant, having retired from the ICS to become welfare officer and then Commissioner for Resettlement of Soldiers in Punjab. Brayne returned to England prior to Indian independence. He settled at The Glebe, a farm in Ashill, Norfolk, where he attempted to apply his theories of agriculture to an area of . He died on 3 April 1952 at The Glebe, at which time his military rank was stated as being Colonel. He was survived by his wife, four sons and two daughters. == Awards == Aside from being awarded the Military Cross, Brayne was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire in 1941, having being made a Companion of the Order of the Star of India in 1937. He also held the Volunteer Decoration. His wife, Iris Goodeve Brayne, had been awarded the Kaiser-i-Hind Medal in 1928. == See also == *Mark Lugard Brayne == References == Notes Citations == Further reading == * Category:1952 deaths Category:Indian Civil Service (British India) officers Category:Economy of British India Category:Companions of the Order of the Star of India Category:Companions of the Order of the Indian Empire Category:Recipients of the Military Cross Category:British Indian Army officers Category:Military personnel of World War I Category:Military personnel of World War II Category:People from Thetford Category:Recipients of the Order of St. Sava Category:Alumni of Pembroke College, Cambridge Category:People educated at Monkton Combe School Category:20th-century English writers Category:English farmers Category:English evangelicals Category:History of Punjab Category:1882 births ","title":"Frank Lugard Brayne"},{"id":"56565910","text":"Alphonse R√©vial, real name Marie Pauline Fran√ßoise Louis Beno√Æt Alphonse R√©vial (29 May 1810 ‚Äì 13 October 1871) was a 19th-century French tenor and singing professor. == Biography == Born in Toulouse, R√©vial entered the Conservatoire de Paris on 23 October 1829.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. ==History== The Grand Ledge area was first settled in the 1840s. In 1849, a dam and sawmill were constructed across the Grand River at the site, and in 1850 the first commercial establishment in the town opened. In 1853, the first portion of the new settlement was platted; by 1860 about 225 people lived in Grand Ledge. It was about this time that development in the River Ledge Historic District began, as Jefferson became one of the most prestigious streets to live on. In 1869, the Ionia and Lansing Railroad was constructed through Grand Ledge, bringing a trade catering to visitors, as well as a new manufacturing base, to Grand Ledge. Along with the new prosperity came accelerated development in the district, as well-to-do local businessmen and manufacturers began constructing houses. Some of the earliest residents of the district include Edmund Lamson, the founder of Grand Ledge and the first village president; Frank D. Fitzgerald, Governor of Michigan from 1936 to 1939; Edward A. Turnbull, owner of the Grand Ledge Chair Company; hardware dealers Hillard J. Babcock and Sylvester B. Granger; grocer George Coryell; building contractor Elmer Edwards; and doctors Abraham DeGroff and Andrew G. Stanka. Gtowth in the district continued to accelerate through the nineteenth century, with the period of most growth occurring between about 1895 and 1920. Development began to slow then, with the last historically significant structure in the district, the public library, constructed in 1931. ==Description== The River Ledge Historic District contains 282 buildings, of which 235 contribute to the historic nature of the district. All but eight of the buildings were constructed as housing, and nearly all of the houses are single family residences. The structures in the district date from the 1850s to the 1920s, and include a broad range of architectural styles, including Greek Revival and Gothic Revival, Italianate, Queen Anne, Colonial Revival, and Bungalow/craftsman. The district contains the hares of many prominent citizens of early Grand Ledge, as well as several historic civic and church buildings. Some of the significant structures in the district include: * Summers House (520 E. Jefferson): Builtin 1874, this house has paired- bracket eaves, and is one of the best examples of Italianate architecture in the neighborhood. * Edmund Lamson House (405-407 W. Jefferson): An L-shaped, upright-and-wing-type house, with Gothic-arch-head windows. * Sheets- Fitzgerald House (219 W. Jefferson): Built in 1907 and designed by Lansing architect Edwin A. Bowd, this Colonial Revival house has triangular and segmental-arch pedimented dormers, keystones over the windows, and a paneled- pilaster front porch. * First Baptist Church (now Church of Christ) (205 W. Scott): Built in 1874, this church is a brick, Gothic structure with a 1931 tower addition at the corner. * First United Methodist Church (411 Harrison): Built in 1911 on the same site as its 1874 predecessor church, this building is a brick Gothic structure. * Trinity Episcopal Church (201 E. Jefferson): Built in 1911/13, this church is a brick, Gothic structure with corner tower. * Free Methodist Church (now First United Methodist Church annex) (406 S. Bridge): Build about 1900, this is a stucco-clad structure with a corner tower. * Public library (131 E. Jefferson): The Ladies Library Association first began advocating for a library building in 1911; this structure was finally constructed in 1931. It is a red-brick, Renaissance Revival-style structure with a green tile roof, and a large rear wing added in 1958. ==References== Category:National Register of Historic Places in Eaton County, Michigan Category:Victorian architecture in Michigan Category:Colonial Revival architecture in Michigan ","title":"River Ledge Historic District"},{"id":"56565965","text":"The original Bishops Gate House (centre) on an 1882 Ordnance Survey map.

Fitzmaurice founded his biography of Sir William Petty largely on the manuscripts in the so-called 'Bowood' papers. The papers originally belonging to Sir William Petty passed to his grandson, John Petty, 1st Earl of Shelburne (1706-1761), who bought Bowood House in Wiltshire, England in 1754.History of Bowood House (accessed 2017-10-06). The letters written by Sir William Petty to Sir Robert Southwell (1635-1702) were later added to the Bowood papers by the 3rd Marquis of Lansdowne. Apart from the Bowood papers, Fitzmaurice also studied manuscripts in the British Museum, in the Bodleian Library and in the Library of Trinity College, Dublin. Sir William Petty Lord Edmond Fitzmaurice == The biographer: Lord Edmond Fitzmaurice == Lord Edmond Fitzmaurice (1846-1935), also named Edmond George Petty-Fitzmaurice, was a descendant of William Petty and a liberal politician. He also published a biography of his great-grandfather, William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne in 1912, biographies of Granville Leveson-Gower, 2nd Earl Granville (in 1905) and of Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel (in 1901), and some theatre plays. == The biography == The biography is chronological. In the first chapter the life of Petty up to 1652 is summarized. It ends with his application as surgery-general in Cromwell's Irish army. In the second and third chapter, which cover a total of 80 pages, an extensive description is given of the Down Survey, the cadastral survey carried out by Petty in 1655 and 1656, and especially on the long aftermath of that survey. After the survey Petty was accused of fraud and bribery, and it took him years to clear his name. The next chapters cover the period from 1660 to 1678, in which Petty published much of the works that, centuries later, brought him fame among economists and statisticians. A separate, central chapter (Chapter 7) is devoted to his \\"Political Arithmetic\\" (and his opinions concerning political economy). The last three chapters give an overview of the period from 1678 until Petty's death in 1687. == Critical reception == The Life of Petty was reviewed in different journals. wrote a review in Die Neue Zeit, 1896. He was happy to see that a biography on William Petty had appeared: 'Finally, more than two hundred years after his death, the most genial of the English political economists of the seventeenth century has found his biographer', writes Cunow in his review in Die Neue Zeit in 1896. But, does he write subsequently, the (large amount of) work that is done by Fitzmaurice, does not provide a satisfactory result and does not offer a clear image of the character (of Petty). Questions like 'what where the influences that worked on Petty's intellectual development?' are not answered and only on very few places insight is given into the depth of Petty's ideas ('Ideenwelt'). Neither gives Fitzmaurice an account of the less attractive sides of Petty's character, like his ruthless addiction to profitmaking. Cunow also makes some remarks concerning Bevan's Sir William Petty : A Study in English Economic Literature (1894). wrote a review in The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science of 1896, together with a review of .

The Arc of Ascent (\\"qaws al-su'ud\\") is the way back to the Presence of God, the process of spiritual perfection.

James Thomson, pastor of Steeple Church, Dundee, and his wife Hannah Thomson, n√©e Turnbull. He emigrated to South Australia aboard Georgiana, arriving in Adelaide in August 1839. Before leaving Scotland he purchased Section 4208 in the Mount Barker region. Another reference has him purchasing the land from Hampden Dutton after arriving in the colony. In 1840 Thomson was involved with Robert Cock and J. L. Crabb in a venture to sell lots of land in Balhannah, which Thomson named for his mother (and also his sister) Hannah, the prefix Bal being a Gaelic word meaning \\"place\\" or \\"town\\", as in Balnagowan and Balmoral. He built the Balhannah Inn, which he let to one S. Bartlett who left shortly after. A year later he reopened the Inn, with himself as publican, followed by James Anderson. In 1855 Thomson's application for a licence was refused, while Edward Morris's application for the Golden Cross Hotel (now the Balhannah Hotel) was granted, sparking a feud which culminated in Thomson's serving time in jail for slander. He brewed his first beer at Balhannah in August 1843 with the assistance of W. Milne and W. Johnston, one of the brothers who later founded the Oakbank Brewery. In June 1844 he was obliged to mortgage his property and in 1855 had a second attempt at beer brewing. He was several times in financial difficulties, on one occasion helped out by his father, who purchased his property, then mortgaged it to pay a debt to Alexander Cock. His body was found in marsh land near the North Arm Road, Dry Creek. He never married and appeared to have no relations in South Australia, though one John Thomson (1794‚Äì1869), later of \\"Lilybank\\", Mount Pleasant, and family are known to have stayed in the Balhannah region during their first years in the colony. ==Further reading== == References == Category:1810 births Category:1876 deaths Category:Australian brewers ","title":"James Turnbull Thomson"},{"id":"56566308","text":"William Aikenhead (7 May 1842 ‚Äì 3 April 1902) was an Australian politician, who was a member of the Tasmanian House of Assembly from 1898 until his death in office in 1902.

All satellites are equipped with a S-Band radio emitter and receiver, which not only enables communication with the ground-based control center but also allows for communication between the individual satellites. The number of satellites in the network was set to four as this number represents the best cost-benefit-ratio. With four satellites, a total of six independent communication links are possible, while only three are possible with three satellites. Moreover, four is the lowest number that enables multi-hop communication. The satellites are powered by solar cells and batteries and have a planned lifetime of one year. Future applications of the technology may be more effective monitoring of global issues like climate change, disaster management, maritime systems monitoring and even enable satellite constellations for high-bandwidth internet access. ==Launch== The four satellites were successfully launched on a Soyuz-2.1A rocket from Vostochny Site 1S in Russia on 1 February 2018. The launch was originally scheduled for 22 December 2017, however due to the failure of a Soyuz-2.1B rocket, Roscosmos decided to delay the mission. The spacecrafts were released into orbit at an altitude of approximately 580 kilometers at an interval of 10 seconds.

Fl√≤rio, Treccani Enciclopedie on line (retrieved 10 April 2018) ==Biography== He was the son of the Senator of the Kingdom of Italy, Ignazio Florio Sr. and baroness Giovanna D'Ondes Trigona. When his father died in 1891, Ignazio Jr., at the age of 22, inherited one of the greatest fortunes in Italy. Ignazio Florio, il tramonto dell‚Äôimpero che illumin√≤ la Belle Epoque in Sicilia, Il Gazzettino di Sicilia, 1 September 2017 The Florio business empire had far-reaching interests in sulphur, tuna fishing, Marsala wine, insurance and banking, and metallurgy (the Oretea foundry) and engineering. The Florio family was a major share holder in the Navigazione Generale Italiana (NGI), Italy's main shipping company at the time and one of the major one's in Europe.Dickie, Cosa Nostra, pp. 99-100 In 1893, like his father before him, he married a woman from the old Sicilian aristocracy, Francesca Paola Jacona della Motta dei baroni di San Giuliano, who would become known as the \\"Queen of Palermo\\", as she became a prominent protagonist of the Belle √âpoque in Palermo. He was the principal impresario of the Teatro Massimo, when the building was finished in 1897. He was also the main shareholder and financier of the Sicilian daily newspaper L'Ora, founded in 1900 and published in Palermo. L'Ora: la sua storia, Agave (Contributo allo studio delle fonti della storia dell'arte in Italia nel Novecento - Universit√† degli Studi di Palermo) In the heyday of its existence reportedly some 16,000 people depended on the Florio business empire, and the press sometimes referred to Palermo as 'Floriopolis'. However, as international competition increased and the economic importance was moving to the north of Italy, to the cities of Milan, Turin and Genoa, the family had to face an increasingly deteriorated economic reality resulting in bankruptcies and closures of activity. Florio, Treccani Dizionario di Economia e Finanza (2012) (retrieved 10 April 2018) In 1897 he had founded the Cantiere navale di Palermo (Palermo Shipyard) to service the commercial fleet. Construction was protracted, however, and Florio was forced to sell his stake in the shipyard to Attilio Odero in 1905. He was also forced to sell the family's interests in NGI in 1908. The blockage of maritime and commercial activities caused by the First World War paralyzed the activities of the Florios. l tramonto dei Florio, Giuseppe Barone, Meridiana nr. 11-12, 1991 The Florio empire began to fade. The shipping lines depended mainly on state subsidies; the beneficial effects of the Unification of Italy had disappeared and the size of the economic empire had made it increasingly difficult to be directly manage by Ignazio, without the interference of the banks and competitors in the north. The stagnation of the family businesses, despite the awareness of the imminent decline, resulted in huge debts and all the Florio companies either were sold or disappeared. Contrary to what the founder Vincenzo Florio Sr. had done in the first half of the nineteenth century, the later generations did not sufficiently diversify their interests in new markets and did not invest in the new technologies available at the beginning of the twentieth century. They were simply trying to maintain the already acquired market positions, without opening new and more profitable ones. Despite the increasing economic difficulties, the Florios maintained their expensive way of life. After the sale of Villa Florio all'Olvuzza in 1924, the family moved to Rome. Between 1925 and 1935 the economic collapse deprived Ignazio Junior of all his assets. In 1935 Donna Franca's jewels and their furniture and real estate were auctioned in Palermo. In spite of everything, the Florios never failed: Ignazio Florio jr did not escape his responsibilities, he sold all the companies and the whole family patrimony to pay his debts to the last penny, before retiring to private life. The last years of his life were marked by total apathy, deafness and complete loneliness except for the presence of his wife. After the death of the latter in 1950, he returned to Palermo where he died on 19 September 1957. == Issue == Ignazio Jr. and his wife Franca had five children: * Giovanna (1893-1902) * Ignazio (1898-1903) * Giacobina (stillborn) * Costanza Igiea (1900-1974) * Giulia (1909-1989) == Further reading == * Candela, Simona.

He studied in Crema and Milan before setting off from Genoa to Naples and then to the Burmese missions via boat. He pledged that he would never return to the Italian mainland and spent the remainder of his life working with the Burmese people in mountain villages despite the great difficulties he faced. Cremonesi was also a prisoner of the Japanese during World War II after the Japanese occupied the nation. The Burmese independence reached in 1948 prompted guerrilla conflict which caused great unrest and destruction to the point that Cremonesi and other missionaries were forced into exile so as to remain safe. But he reached out to the guerillas and received their permission to return to the village he worked in. It was also there in that village that government forces mistook him for a rebel - or a supporter of the rebels - and shot him dead alongside the village chief and two girls. The beatification process for the late priest opened in 2004 and he became titled as a Servant of God. Pope Francis approved his beatification and it took place in Crema on 19 October 2019. ==Life== ===Childhood and education=== Alfredo Cremonesi was born on 15 May 1902 in Ripalta Guerina in Cremona as the first of seven children to the grocer Enrico Cremonesi and Maria Rosa Scartabellati. His siblings (in order) were: * Tarcisio (1904‚àí1952) * Ernesto (1908‚àí1945) * Giovanni (1909‚àí1966) * Giuseppe (1911‚àí1980) * Rodolfo (1914‚àí1987) * Teresina (1920‚àíDecember 2002) He received his baptism on 16 May in the local parish church from Father Angelo Bassi. One cousin was Amina Uselli and a paternal aunt was the nun Sister Gemma (16 July 1878‚àí3 April 1958). Cremonesi received his Confirmation on 4 October 1908 from the Bishop of Crema Ernesto Fontana and then made his First Communion on 1 April 1909. His father was a devoted Christian who opposed Fascism and it was his mother who oversaw the religious education of the seven children. It was in his childhood at some stage that he read the journal of Saint Th√©r√®se of Lisieux and from that point fostered a deep devotion to her. His brother Ernesto was also a devoted Christian whom the Nazis arrested and jailed in a concentration camp where he would die in 1945 before the European Theatre conflict ended. Cremonesi sent a letter to his parents upon learning this and said that \\"I am proud to be his brother\\" and that \\"Ernesto will be able to do more in paradise than he could have done on earth\\". His time in school was interrupted due to a severe disease and he was forced to spend most of that time confined to his bed. His frail health since childhood led to people concluding that he would never be able to enter the missions since it would be improbable that he would be cured of his consistent ailments. The desire to enter the missions had been a dream he had for sometime since his late childhood and into his adolescence. But he defied the odds (and the expectation of doctors who thought he would die in a few months) and overcame his disease with Cremonesi attributing his healing to Saint Th√©r√®se of Lisieux. Upon his recuperation he transferred to Milan for education in an institute that the Pontifical Institute for Foreign Missions managed to prepare new missionaries on 17 September 1922. He became known for being both impetuous and a gifted writer who published a collection of poems. ===Ordination and departure=== Between October and November 1923 he received the minor orders before being elevated into the subdiaconate on 19 April 1924 and the diaconate on 29 June 1924. The seminarian received his ordination to the priesthood in October 1924 (from the P.I.M.E. bishop Giovanni Menicatti in the San Francesco Saverio church) and then in June 1925 learned that his dream to enter the missions was to take place for he would be sent to the then- Burma. Cremonesi received a special dispensation for his ordination since he had not reached the canonical age required for ordination. Cremonesi celebrated his first Mass on 19 October 1924 in San Michele and on 5 October 1925 received the cross of the missions from the Archbishop of Milan Eugenio Tosi. But before being sent to the missions he was put in charge of teaching the Italian language in the Seminario Minore di San Ilario in Nervi in Genoa. He left Genoa for Naples and set sail from there on 16 October 1925 but before leaving declared he would never return to his homeland despite the insistence of his relatives to return for a visit. His mother did not take well to his desire for the missions but relented to her son's wishes and maintained correspondence with him on a frequent basis. Cremonesi celebrated his last Mass before leaving in Crema in the Santuario della Madonna delle Grazie on 4 October 1925. ===Apostolate=== But his new mission also proved difficult for the enthusiastic Cremonesi who suffered from loneliness for a brief time upon his arrival on 10 November 1925. He worked with the Karen people in an isolated mountain village and often had to travel miles between communities to visit the people. His first assignment was in Yedash√© in western Yoma to visit villages and he was successful in the conversion of some of the natives. He was later transferred to Donok√π and would remain there until the outbreak of World War II in relative peace. Cremonesi was often exhausted from his extensive trips and he even once contracted malaria. During the 1920s he maintained correspondence with the P.I.M.E. superior Blessed Paolo Manna and met with Manna when he visited the Burmese missions on 19 February 1928. The outbreak of World War II saw the British-run Burma enter the conflict to the detriment of Italian missionaries who soon found themselves as enemies due to Benito Mussolini declaring his alliance with the Axis powers. To that end he was moved further north to Mosh√≤ to work in the villages. Near the end of the war he was forced to live in the forest where he ate herbs in order to survive. Cremonesi wrote of the trials he endured during the war in a letter dated on 20 February 1946; he refers to his lack of food and clothing (limited to what he had on) and noting that villages were devoid of people with marketplaces being abandoned. In 1941 he avoided Japanese imprisonment in a concentration camp in India after the Japanese occupied the nation. He lived eating herbs cooked in salt and water during this time but was discovered and caught. In the final month of the war a Japanese officer took him and tied him up for the night before allowing him to leave in the morning where he took refuge in the woods. Cremonesi did not understand the reason for his release but attributed it to the intercession of God. Cremonesi fostered a great devotion to Saint Th√©r√®se of Lisieux and to the Sacred Heart. He practiced Eucharistic Adoration each night for one hour before the tabernacle and awoke around 4:00am in the morning to celebrate Mass. He returned to Donok√π after the war had ended to resume his work. But Burmese independence from the British Empire in 1948 prompted conflict once the Karen people rebelled and started to resort to use guerilla tactics against the new government. This conflict would endure even after Cremonesi's later murder. In August 1950 the rebels attacked the village prompting both Cremonesi and the inhabitants to flee into the forest before he took refuge close o the mission in Taungngu. Cremonesi was saddened that these occurrences had taken place and he referred to his current state as an exile. On 25 March 1952 he was permitted to return to the village where he was able to resume his work after he made contact with the guerillas who allowed him to return to the village. Cremonesi knew of Clemente Vismara and wrote of him in high esteem. ===Murder=== The rebels defeated government soldiers - on 7 February 1953 - which prompted the surviving government forces to flee to the village that Cremonesi was stationed in. But the soldiers soon became convinced upon their entrance that the villagers favored the rebels and were perhaps allies to the rebels. This presented a clear danger to the villagers which prompted Cremonesi to intervene to assure them that there were no rebels nor rebel allies present in the village. This convinced the soldiers who left the village in peace. But the rebels ambushed the soldiers just outside the village which prompted the soldiers to return in anger to seek out Cremonesi believing it had been a set up. The soldiers even perceived his clothing to be alike to that of the rebels. Cremonesi's words went ignored and the soldiers fired their machine guns at him and the village chief who both collapsed to the ground (the village chief died while Cremonesi was still alive after being shot in the chest). Two girls were behind them and were killed in that attack. The villagers fled into the forest during the commotion while the soldiers entered the local church and desecrated it before setting the village ablaze. Once this was done the commander approached the injured Cremonesi and shot him in the face at point-blank range when he realized the priest was still alive. The villagers returned to the remains of their village on 8 February to collect and inter the dead which included Cremonesi (while also washing his remains). But the villagers - before his burial - cut some parts of his beard and bloodied shirt and sent it to P.I.M.E. authorities in Taungngu in an envelope with an inscription: \\"Relics of the martyr Father Cremonesi to be sent to his parents\\". On 7 May 1953 a P.I.M.E. priest visited Donok√π for the identification of his remains which were exhumed for a solemn funeral and burial in Taungngu. His death was announced in Crema in the diocesan paper \\"Il nuovo Torrazzo\\" on 14 February 1953 in a piece entitled \\"Abbiamo un martire\\". ==Beatification== The beatification process opened on 29 March 2004 under Pope John Paul II after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints titled the late priest as a Servant of God and issued an edict that declared \\"nihil obstat\\" (no objections to the cause). The general forum for the process (the investigation) was transferred on 4 March 2004 from Taungngu to the Cremona diocese but it was also conducted in the Taunggyi archdiocese. The diocesan process of investigation was opened in 2004 and concluded on 9 June 2004 in the two dioceses with their respective heads (Bishop Dante Lafranconi and Matthias U Shwe) overseeing the process. The C.C.S. issued a decree on 9 February 2007 that made the diocesan investigation valid while historical consultants to the C.C.S. approved Cremonesi's cause on 13 May 2014 after assessing the historical context in which he died. The postulation drafted and submitted the Positio dossier to the C.C.S. in 2015 for evaluation while nine theologians confirmed the cause in their meeting held on 6 February 2018. The C.C.S. cardinal and bishop members met and approved the cause on 5 March 2019. Pope Francis approved the cause on 19 March 2019 which allowed for Cremonesi to be beatified; it was celebrated on 19 October 2019 in Crema with Cardinal Giovanni Angelo Becciu presiding over the celebration on the pope's behalf. It has been confirmed from some officials close to the cause in Cremona that the beatification - if and when approved - would be celebrated in Cremona. It was later elaborated on that there were high hopes that Cremonesi could be beatified in October 2019 when the cause received papal approval. The current postulator for this cause is Dr. Francesca Consolini. ==See also== * Pontifical Institute for Foreign Missions * Blessed Clemente Vismara * Blessed Paolo Manna * Blessed Mario Vergara ==References== ==External links== * Hagiography Circle * Italian biography Category:1902 births Category:1953 deaths Category:20th-century Italian people Category:20th-century Roman Catholic martyrs Category:20th-century Italian Roman Catholic priests Category:20th-century venerated Christians Category:Beatifications by Pope Francis Category:Deaths by firearm in Myanmar Category:Italian beatified people Category:Italian expatriates in Myanmar Category:Italian people executed abroad Category:People from the Province of Cremona Category:People shot dead by law enforcement officers Category:Roman Catholic missionaries in Myanmar ","title":"Alfredo Cremonesi"},{"id":"56566462","text":"Best Selection is the title of two compilation albums released by Aimer on May 3, 2017.

Since its inception, Kids Saving the Rainforest has planted or is in the process of planting nearly 100,000 trees and rescued and rehabilitated 3,000 wild animals, two-thirds of which have been released back into the wild. KSTR's mission is: \\"to protect the diverse wildlife of Costa Rica‚Äôs Pacific Coast by rehabilitating wildlife, conducting original scientific research, training volunteers, and promoting conservation.\\" ==History== Kids Saving the Rainforest was founded in February 1999 by two nine-year old girls, Janine Licare and Aislin Livingstone, who were living in the jungle of Manuel Antonio, Costa Rica. The girls made paper- mache bottles and painted rocks and sold them by the side of the road to raise money for saplings that would be planted in the nearby forest. Since then, KSTR has become a fully functional environmental organization with a board of directors. Licare's mother, Jennifer Rice is president. The staff includes a number of full-time people plus volunteers. KSTR is located outside Manual Antonio, Costa Rica, but has projects in 18 countries. ==Programs== ===Rescue, rehabilitate and release=== KSTR rescues and rehabs animals that are brought to their facility. In addition, the ones that can not be released back into the wild are given sanctuary for life on the property. The goal is to release as many animals as possible. With an average of 200 rescues a year, over 75 species have been rescued at their center. This includes, among others, two- and three-toed sloths, squirrel monkeys, kinkajous, coatis, marmosets, tamarins, orange-chinned parakeets. ===Wildlife bridges=== KSTR started a Wildlife Bridge Program in 2000, originally to protect the endangered titi monkeys (squirrel monkey). They have since put up 130 bridges and 14 different animal species have been using them. Meanwhile, the titi monkey population has doubled. Whenever an arboreal animal is electrocuted by live wires, hit by a car, or attacked by dogs, KSTR reviews the necessity of a bridge and places it for them to cross high off the ground. ===Reforestation=== Since its inception, KSTR has planted over 7,000 trees, is in the process of planting another 80,000 on donated property elsewhere in Costa Rica, and reforests in other countries as well. ===Volunteers=== In order to run its facility and care for the animals, KSTR relies on volunteers who come in from around the world to help with all aspects of its programs. The volunteers clean, repair, and build cages, work on trails, prepare food for the animals, observe behavior, and more. Many volunteers are housed where they work at KSTR, but some opt for a day of volunteer work offered by area tour companies. ===Education=== A key element of KSTR is education about biodiversity conservation. Visitors who take the tours of the facility are given an educational talk about the rainforest and its inhabitants. ==Funding== KSTR operates entirely on donations. ==References== Category:Animal rescue groups Category:Environmental organizations based in Costa Rica ","title":"Kids Saving the Rainforest"},{"id":"56566824","text":"The European Union Chamber of Commerce in China, doing business as European Chamber, is a non-profit and non-governmental organisation established to support and represent the interests of companies from the European Union operating in China.

The river takes its name from an arm of Lake Nipissing into which it flows, South Bay. ==Geography== Situated in the northwestern quadrant of the Algonquin Dome (of which the Almaguin Highlands form the western edge) the headwaters of the South are located in wetlands north of Togo Lake at an elevation of 465 m. The river heads in a northwesterly direction, meandering through the Almaguin Highlands before emptying into Lake Nipissing at 195m, descending some 270m along its course. http://www4.rncan.gc.ca/search-place-names/unique/FCQQW ==Tributaries== The South has a number of smaller tributaries, chief among them are, Paul, Beatty, Genesee, McGillvray, Black (Gurd), Trout, Bray, Black (Machar), Smyth, and Craig. ==Communities== An estimated 4750 people live along the South, the river itself giving rise to many villages in the Highlands, including Nipissing, Powassan, Trout Creek, and the eponymous South River. These communities were built around the rapids and waterfalls along the river, harnessing the energy and force of the cascading water to power sawmills in the 19th century. Logging was the chief industry in the region, attracting many pioneers, settlers, immigrants, and lumber barons, all seeking a livelihood from the vast resources of timber that abounded in the river‚Äôs watershed. The South flows through the following townships: (from upstream to downstream) Paxton (unorganized Nipissing District), Joly, Laurier, Machar, Gurd, Powassan (South Himsworth), and Nipissinghttp://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/traveller/map/images/pdf/southont/sheets/Map8.pdf. ==Hydroelectricity== There are numerous control and electricity producing dams located on the South, making use of the rapids and waterfalls much the same way the early sawmills did. Ownership of the dams is a mix of private companies and government corporations. ==Tourism== The South has always been a popular canoe route, with arguably the most famous person to paddle its waters and take inspiration from it, being the early 20th century artist Tom Thomson. In the Village of South River on the shores of the waterway is located the Tom Thomson Park, the site in which Thomson would pull his canoe from the river and board the train bound for his studio and clients in Southern Ontario. The Municipality of Powassan organizes a canoe race every summer along the portion of the river within its boundaries. There are numerous wilderness outfitters and tourist camps interspersed with private cottages and homes dotting the shores of the South. ==See also== * List of rivers of Ontario ==References== Category:Rivers of Parry Sound District ","title":"South River (Ontario)"},{"id":"56567053","text":"Keroplatus militaris is a species of predatory fungus gnats in the family Keroplatidae. ==References== ==Further reading== * ==External links== * Category:Keroplatidae ","title":"Keroplatus militaris"},{"id":"56567058","text":"Keroplatus is a genus of predatory fungus gnats in the family Keroplatidae.

After showing promising form in the United States as a juvenile in 1900 she was set to race in England. In June 1901 on her British debut she recorded an emphatic win in the Epsom Oaks, becoming the first American horse to do so. She never recaptured her Epsom form and was retired from racing in 1903. After returning to United States she had some success as a broodmare. ==Background== Cap and Bells was a bay or brown mare bred in Kentucky by the father and son partnership of James R. Keene and Foxhall Keene the latter of whom owned her during her racing career. She was initially sent into training in the United States. She was from the second of only two crops of foals sired by Domino, an outstanding American racehorse who died in 1897 at the age of six. Her dam, the British- bred mare Ben-My-Chree, was a daughter of Ulster Queen, making her a close relative of Louvois (2000 Guineas) and Louviers (runner-up in the Epsom Derby). ==Racing career== ===1900: two-year-old season=== At Brighton Beach Racetrack on 24 July Cap and Bells won the Spinster Stakes, beating the favourite Sweet Lavender \\"with ease\\". On 25 August the filly was stepped up in class for the Belmont Futurity Stakes which at that time was the most important race for two-year-olds in the United States. She led the field until the home but faded down the stretch and finished unplaced behind W. C. Whitney's Ballyhoo Bey. Shortly after the race it was announced that Keene intended to campaign his filly in England in 1901. ===1901: three-year-old season=== On her arrival in England Cap and Bells entered training with Sam Darling at his stable at Beckhampton in Wiltshire. On 7 June Cap and Bells, ridden by the American jockey Milton Henry, was one of twenty-one fillies to contest the 123rd running of the Oaks Stakes over one and a half miles at Epsom Racecourse. The race was run in fine weather in front of a near-record crowd. Despite her lack of experience on the surface (turf) and the distance she was made the 9/4 favourite, with Lord Derby's filly Santa Brigida (third in the 1000 Guineas) the only one of her opponents to start at less than 10/1. She had not been among the favourites in the build-up but was heavily backed on the morning of the race. The favourite's stablemate Noonday set the pace and led the field into the straight but Cap and Bells went to the front soon after and drew away to win \\"in a canter\\" by six lengths. Lord Ellesmere's 50/1 outsider Sabrinetta (ridden by the American C Jenkins) finished second, with three lengths back to Minnie Dee (owned by Richard Croker and ridden by another American Lester Reiff) in third place. According to the Los Angeles Herald \\"the race furnished extraordinary proof of the superior ability of American breeders, trainers and jockeys\\". Foxhall Keene donated the prize- money to British and American charities, including the Prince of Wales's Hospital Fund. Later that year, Keene reportedly declined an offer to match his filly against W. C. Whitney's Epsom Derby winner Volodyovski. ===1902: four-year-old season=== Cap and Bells remained in training as a four-year-old but failed to recover her best form. In the Gold Cup at Royal Ascot in June she finished tailed-off in last place behind William the Third. Cap and Bells returned to the United States in 1903. ==Assessment and honours== In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Cap and Bells a \\"superior\\" winner of the Oaks. ==Breeding record== At the end of her racing career, Cap and Bells was retired to become a broodmare for the Keenes' stud. he produced at least eight foals between 1905 and 1916: *Pink And Blue, a brown filly, foaled in 1905, sired by Kingston *Wamba, bay colt, 1906, by Ben Brush. Won fourteen races in England. *Sapphire, bay filly, 1907, by Star Ruby *Jest, brown filly, 1908, by Ben Brush. Winner. *Junina, brown filly, 1909, by Delhi *Boots And Saddle, chestnut colt, 1911, by Voter *Capra, chestnut filly, 1912, by Ballot.

Set in 1851, it is about a railway robbery which is investigated and ultimately solved by two Scotland Yard detectives, Inspector Robert Colbeck and Sergeant Victor Leeming. The novel was published in 2004 by Allison & Busby of London. The book's cover depicts part of The Railway Station (1862) by William Powell Frith. According to the publishers in a 2018 news release, the series has been optioned for television adaptation by Mammoth Screen. ==Plot introduction== In April 1851, shortly before the opening of the Great Exhibition at the Crystal Palace in Hyde Park, London, a mail train on the London and North Western Railway (L&NWR;) is halted between Leighton Buzzard Junction and Linslade Tunnel by a group of men disguised as railway police. Using duplicated Chubb safe keys, they steal all the mailbags and a consignment of over ¬£3,000 in sovereigns being transferred from the Royal Mint to a bank in Birmingham. The train driver, who tries to resist the robbers, is badly injured and his fireman is forced to drive the engine forward to where a section of track has been removed, causing a derailment. The robbers escape and the alarm is raised by telegraph to the Metropolitan Police Force in Scotland Yard, London, where it is received by Detective Superintendent Edward Tallis, head of the Detective Department. ==Plot summary== Tallis summons Detective Inspector Robert Colbeck to his office and orders him to lead the investigation. It is quickly established that there is an \\"unresolved tension\\" between Tallis and Colbeck which is an underlying theme of the whole series, although the two have great professional respect for each other. Colbeck and Detective Sergeant Victor Leeming travel to Leighton Buzzard where they meet Inspector Rory McTurk of the railway police. McTurk strongly resents their involvement but Colbeck and Leeming soon establish that members of the railway police were guilty of deserting their posts on the train in order to play cards, thus making it much easier for the gang to carry out the robbery. Meanwhile, train driver Caleb Andrews is not expected to survive and his daughter Madeleine arrives in Leighton Buzzard to care for him. Colbeck is convinced that the gang had inside information and were certainly in possession of duplicated safe keys. He and Leeming begin enquiries at the organisations involved with the shipment: the L&NWR;, the Post Office, the Royal Mint, the fictitious Spurling's Bank in Birmingham and the Chubb factory in Wolverhampton. As a result, they become aware of Daniel Slender, who duplicated the safe keys at Chubb; William Ings of the Post Office, who was involved in the mail train's scheduling; and Albert Woodhead of the Royal Mint, who unwittingly advised Ings of the gold consignment. The L&NWR; and the Birmingham bank are absolved of involvement in the crime. Ings is the first of the suspects to be pursued and Colbeck discovers that he is hiding in the notorious Devil's Acre. To find Ings, Colbeck seeks help from Brendan Mulryne, a former colleague who is now a resident there. Mulryne establishes a connection between Ings and the prostitute Polly Roach but, though he finds Roach, he is too late to prevent the murder of Ings. In due course, Slender meets a similar fate. It is clear to Colbeck that the gang are eliminating loose ends and weak links to remain undetected. Colbeck is concerned about the unnecessary destruction of the steam engine after the robbery and believes he is looking for someone with influence who hates the railways. Although Tallis dismisses Colbeck's theory, it is valid as gang leader Sir Humphrey Gilzean has an obsessive hatred of railways. He blames them for the accidental death of his wife. The gang strikes again at the Kilsby Tunnel, placing gunpowder at one end in a bid to destroy both the tunnel and a train carrying glass sheets for use in the Crystal Palace. The explosion is detonated too soon to destroy the train and causes only superficial damage to the tunnel. Colbeck makes the connection and realises, despite more opposition from Tallis, that an attempt will be made to destroy the locomotives on display at the Great Exhibition. Colbeck is right about the Crystal Palace and, aided by Leeming and Mulryne, is able to arrest Jukes and the Seymours one night when they try to destroy the Lord of the Isles. The gangsters refuse to give information about their leaders. Gilzean and Sholto have added to their haul by blackmailing the senders of complicit letters which were in the stolen mailbags. They are fearful of imminent arrest and Gilzean instructs Sholto to find someone whom Colbeck cares about to distract him from the investigation. Caleb Andrews is no longer a critical case and has been taken home where Madeleine is looking after him. She has met Colbeck in the course of the investigation and there is a mutual attraction between them which develops as the novel progresses. Sholto follows Colbeck and observes the affection he has for Madeleine during a visit to the Andrews household. As a result, Gilzean and Sholto kidnap Madeleine and send a demand to the Met for the release of Jukes and the Seymours. Working on what little is known about the three prisoners, Colbeck and Leeming discover their common military background and make the link between them and two of their former officers who both left the Army on the same day. These are Gilzean and Sholto. Colbeck establishes that Gilzean has a pathological hatred of railways and even Tallis agrees that the case has been solved, so the investigation is now a manhunt but with Madeleine's life at stake. Fortunately for Madeleine, Gilzean is protective of her and will not allow Sholto to molest her. Tallis leads a raid on Gilzean's Berkshire residence but he bungles it and the criminals escape, still holding Madeleine as a hostage. Colbeck finds documents in Gilzean's house which convince him they are taking Madeleine to Bristol to board ship and flee the country. The criminals are travelling by road and so Colbeck and Leeming go to Bristol via the Great Western Railway (GWR). They arrive first and intercept the two criminals on board their ship in harbour. Madeleine, unharmed, is freed and reunited with her father. The bond between Colbeck and Madeleine is permanent and, when Colbeck receives two complimentary tickets from the grateful Prince Albert for the opening of the Great Exhibition, he invites Madeleine to join him. ==Characters in \\"The Railway Detective\\"== ===Main characters (all recurring)=== *Robert Colbeck ‚Äì Detective Inspector working for the Detective Department at Scotland Yard. Described as \\"conventionally handsome\\" and aged in his early thirties, he is from a family of cabinetmakers. He dresses fastidiously, as a \\"dandy\\", much to the annoyance of Tallis. Having been educated in law, he became a barrister but his life was changed in 1847 by the murder of Helen Milligan, whom he loved (see \\"Blood on the Line\\"). He decided that crime prevention and arresting criminals were more important than securing convictions in court. He therefore joined the Met, starting out as a constable on the beat in Hoxton. He was soon promoted and, by 1851, is acknowledged to be the best detective in the force. His success in solving the train robbery earns him the title of \\"The Railway Detective\\". Colbeck is unmarried in 1851 but when he meets Madeleine after the train robbery, in which her father was seriously injured, he is immediately attracted to her and their developing relationship is a series theme. *Victor Leeming ‚Äì Detective Sergeant working for the Detective Department. Formerly a constable on the beat, he is Colbeck's assistant investigator and, despite polarity in background and character, they are close friends. Leeming is \\"slightly older\\" than Colbeck, so mid-thirties in 1851. Unlike Colbeck at this stage of the series, Leeming is married with a young family. His commitment to his family does not sit well with the workaholic Tallis who regards family as a distraction from work. Leeming is described as having an unprepossessing appearance and, having come from one of London's rougher districts, is a tough character who knows how to look after himself. He is nevertheless humorous and, although he is Colbeck's foil to a large extent, he is a highly competent investigator in his own right, his tenacity being a noted attribute. The character of Leeming, especially with the name Victor, is an amalgam of many played by Victor McLaglen. Whereas Colbeck as the eponymous \\"railway detective\\" is enthralled by the \\"Railway Age\\", Leeming hates travelling by train. He loves horses and often says he would like to be a hansom cab driver. *Edward Tallis ‚Äì Detective Superintendent in charge of the Detective Department. A \\"stout, red-faced man in his fifties\\", he is a terse, irascible individual who believes firmly in discipline and dedication to duty, characteristics defined by his Army background. A martinet, Tallis is frequently at odds with Colbeck and Leeming because of personality clash, though he actually has enormous respect for them both. In turn, they respect his organisational ability. Tallis achieved the rank of major in the Army but does not use the title as a police officer. He is always Mister or Superintendent. He is a workaholic whose outside the Detective Department are confined to religion and military history. Tallis takes a hard line against crime and is appalled that there are only two capital offences on the statute book. *Madeleine Andrews ‚Äì Daughter of Caleb who soon becomes Colbeck's love interest. Madeleine has brown hair and is \\"attractive, alert, calm and strong- willed\\". She is in her early twenties and is a talented artist who specialises in steam locomotives, both in drawings and watercolours. She and Colbeck are attracted to each other at their first meeting when Madeleine visits Scotland Yard to offer information about the train robbery case. Colbeck encourages her artistic talent and she soon begins to secure commissions. *Caleb Andrews ‚Äì Engine driver who is proud to work for the L&NWR.; This pride often surfaces in criticisms of other railway companies and especially of Isambard Kingdom Brunel and the Great Western Railway (GWR). He is a \\"short, wiry man in his fifties with a suppressed energy\\". He was widowed five years earlier and is largely reliant upon his daughter Madeleine, who keeps house for him in Camden and \\"looks after him with a mixture of kindness, cajolery and uncompromising firmness\\". The latter is necessary because Caleb is opinionated and can be stubborn even when proved wrong. Caleb is nevertheless determined to see Madeleine happily married. *Brendan Mulryne ‚Äì A huge, jovial Irishman who loves his beer and a good fight. He was formerly a policeman who shared his beat with Leeming but was discharged from the force because of brawling. He is currently a bouncer at a pub in the Devil's Acre. He has remained a close friend of Colbeck, who tried to save his job in the police, and Leeming. *Estelle Leeming ‚Äì Victor's wife who is described, unlike himself, as attractive. It is a happy marriage of erstwhile close friends between whom love has developed gradually. Until the marriage of Colbeck and Madeleine much later in the series, Estelle is an unseen character who is frequently mentioned by her husband. Victor's main reasons for hating long train journeys is that they take him away from Estelle and their two children. ===Villains=== *Sir Humphrey Gilzean ‚Äì Leader of the train robbery gang, he is a man driven by hatred of the railways after his wife was killed in a fall from her horse, which had been spooked by a train whistle. A \\"tall, striking figure in his late thirties\\", Gilzean is an aristocrat who is a former soldier and owns land in Berkshire. He has been a Tory MP for the last three years. Gilzean is a paradox, being a murderer who nevertheless insists on \\"gentlemanly behaviour\\" towards women. That is why he returns Ings' share of the loot to Maud and why he forbids Sholto to molest Madeleine. Gilzean had been a major in the 10th (North Lincoln) Regiment of Foot and had retired five years earlier. *Thomas Sholto ‚Äì The same age as Gilzean, Sholto is tall, well-dressed and has a full beard. Gilzean and Sholto met at school and were afterwards commissioned in the same regiment before serving in India together. Sholto was a captain who retired on the same day as Gilzean. He is now Gilzean's right hand man and enforcer. He killed Ings and Slender when they met him for their share of the loot. *William (Bill) Ings ‚Äì Former Post Office official and one of only four employees who knew about the gold consignment. Ings has sold out to Gilzean and Sholto. Having quit his job and left his wife, Ings is pursuing his gambling habit and living with prostitutes until meeting Sholto for his payout. *Daniel Slender ‚Äì Former Chubb official who has duplicated the keys of the safe on the mail train. He has moved to London and is using his new wealth to buy suits tailored in Bond Street. *Arthur Jukes ‚Äì Senior gang member who is \\"a big, bulky man in his thirties with ginger whiskers\\". Jukes had been a non-commissioned officer (NCO) under Gilzean and Sholto in India. *Vernon Seymour ‚Äì Gang member who lives in the notorious Seven Dials district. Formerly a private in the 10th North Lincoln. *Harry Seymour ‚Äì Youngest gang member, brother of Vernon Seymour. Formerly a private in the 10th North Lincoln. ===Other characters=== *Frank Pike ‚Äì Caleb's L&NWR; fireman when the train is robbed. He is a friend of the Andrews family outside work. *Rose Pike ‚Äì Wife of Frank. An unseen character in this novel. *Rory McTurk ‚Äì Railway police inspector who is the senior officer at Leighton Buzzard and first on the scene after the train robbery. He is a \\"huge individual with a black beard and shaggy eyebrows\\". He strongly resents the involvement of Scotland Yard, believing that he is capable of solving the crime himself. *Gideon Little ‚Äì Railway fireman with the L&NWR; who is a sometime colleague of Caleb's. He is a would-be suitor for Madeleine. Caleb is in favour of Madeleine marrying a railwayman, but Madeleine has other ideas, especially after meeting Colbeck. *Mr Hayton ‚Äì Leighton Buzzard station master. *Herbert Shipperley ‚Äì Post Office supervisor responsible for mail coach scheduling. His information, when interviewed by Leeming, posits William Ings as a prime suspect. *Maud Ings ‚Äì Wife of Ings, whom he deserted when he became involved in the robbery. *Polly Roach ‚Äì Aging prostitute in the Devil's Acre, for whom Ings has deserted Maud. Roach's possessiveness drives him away and he takes up with Kate Piercy instead. Roach, seeking revenge after being cast aside, finds their bodies. *Isadore Vout ‚Äì Miserly moneylender in the Devil's Acre. Ings has borrowed from him but now owes nothing. Vout is obliged to assist Mulryne in his search for Ings and Roach. *Ernest Kitson ‚Äì Manager of the fictitious Spurling's Bank in Birmingham city centre, the intended destination of the gold shipment. By interviewing Kitson, Colbeck is able to establish that no one at the bank was involved in the robbery. *Charles Omber ‚Äì Security official at the Royal Mint who strenuously argues that none of its employees were involved in leaking information to the gang. Leeming's instincts tell him otherwise and Omber eventually has to apologise after the unwitting complicity of Albert Woodhead is revealed. *Silas Harcutt ‚Äì Manager at the Chubb factory in Wolverhampton. He resents Colbeck's presence but is forced to admit that traces of wax on the keys of the corresponding safe prove that duplicates were made at Chubb. Harcutt names Daniel Slender as one of the people authorised to use the safe keys. *Kate Piercy ‚Äì Young prostitute with whom Ings is co-habiting when he is due to meet Sholto again. Piercy is in the wrong place at the wrong time and is killed as a witness to Ings' murder. *Lord Holcroft ‚Äì Tory politician with a mistress in Birmingham. The villains have found a compromising letter from him to her in the stolen mailbags. He is one of several people whom they blackmail. Holcroft is forced to pay ¬£500 for the return of his letter. *Anna Grayle ‚Äì Unseen character who is Holcroft's mistress. *Ebenezer Trew ‚Äì Bond Street tailor whose snobbery annoys Colbeck. He remembers the murdered Slender as a customer but examination of the account reveals that Slender gave Trew a false address. *Bella Woodhead ‚Äì Post Office employee seduced by Ings who was seeking access to her father. *Albert Woodhead ‚Äì Royal Mint official. Father of Bella who befriended Ings when introduced to him. He unwittingly mentioned the transfer of gold to Ings who advised the robbers. Woodhead is another unseen character. *Richard Mayne ‚Äì Senior Commissioner at Scotland Yard. The only real person playing an active part in the novel. ==Historical references== The Detective Department of the Metropolitan Police Force (the Met) was founded in 1842 and so was only nine years old in 1851, when the story is set. Richard Mayne, who was the joint first commissioner of the Met, is depicted in meetings with Tallis, Colbeck and Leeming. His co-commissioner, Charles Rowan, had retired the year before. Mayne was in charge of policing at The Great Exhibition which opened on 1 May and was an outstanding success, thanks in no small part to effective policing. Mayne is the only real person who plays an active part in the novel. The novel mentions Prince Albert as the exhibition organiser and Joseph Paxton as its main designer. Gilzean's hatred of Paxton was because of Paxton being a director of the Midland Railway, whose chairman John Ellis is an enemy of Gilzean. The Lord of the Isles was a noted locomotive which was displayed at the Great Exhibition before it entered service on the Great Western Railway (GWR). Colbeck mentions the 6-2-0 Liverpool, the Puffing Billy and the 4-2-2 Iron Duke in the context of the exhibition. In the second book, when Madeleine begins to seriously pursue her hobby of locomotive artworks, the Lord of the Isles is her first subject. Caleb Andrews drives for the L&NWR; but his train was travelling on the route built by the London and Birmingham Railway (L&BR;) and opened in 1838. The L&BR; was amalgamated into the L&NWR; in 1846, having been operational since 1833. Robert Stephenson was the L&BR; chief engineer. The line from Euston to Birmingham included the Linslade and Kilsby tunnels which both feature prominently in the book. Marston describes the problems Stephenson faced at Kilsby, where quicksand was unexpectedly encountered. The Crystal Palace's construction materials, its cast iron framework and sheets of glass, were manufactured in Birmingham and Smethwick, so they were transported by rail through the Kilsby tunnel to London. Train robbery was a new phenomenon in the 1850s. There were two in reality before 1851, both on the Bristol and Exeter Railway in 1849. Security was non-existent and the robbers in each case climbed out of their own carriage into the mail van and back. The first major incident was the Great Gold Robbery on the South Eastern Railway in May 1855. The first train robbery in America was by the Reno Gang in Indiana in 1866; there were more infamous robberies in later years by the James‚ÄìYounger Gang and Butch Cassidy's Wild Bunch. The Birmingham bank manager, Ernest Kitson, explains to Colbeck the purpose of the Bank Charter Act 1844 which was introduced by the late Robert Peel as prime minister. The Act is often called the \\"Peel Banking Act\\". It placed strict limits on the issue of banknotes by individual banks who were required to balance all banknotes in their possession with a requisite supply of gold coin or bullion. In the novel, it is because Spurling's fully complied with these rules that a gold consignment was being sent to them. On his trip to Birmingham and Wolverhampton, Colbeck is disturbed by seeing the Black Country and afterwards tells Leeming that he now understands exactly what William Blake meant when he wrote about the \\"dark, satanic mills\\". Colbeck is nevertheless intrigued by industry, especially the railways, and in conversations he refers to Edward Bury, Thomas Russell Crampton and Daniel Gooch as engineers and locomotive designers he especially admires. Caleb Andrews speaks well of Alexander Allan, who claimed to be the designer of the Crewe type locomotive involved in the robbery. The engine was a 2-4-0 introduced by the L&NWR; for freight in 1845. Allan was L&NWR; works manager at Crewe Works from 1843 to 1853. ==Notes and sources== ==External links== * Category:2004 British novels Category:British detective novels Category:British mystery novels Category:Railway Detective series Category:Fiction set in 1851 Category:Novels set in the 1850s Category:Novels set in London ","title":"The Railway Detective"},{"id":"56567343","text":"Lungzubel which means \\"Stone rice beer containers or jars\\" in the Biate language are stone relics found in the southwestern part of Dima Hasao district in Assam and its surrounding areas extending to the neighboring state of Meghalaya. ==Etymology== Lungzubel means a rice beer jar or container in the Biate language. The literal meaning of Lungzubel are ‚Äì 'Lung' means Stone, 'Zu' means Rice beer and 'Bel' means Jar, which comes together as ‚ÄúStone Rice Beer Jar‚Äù. ==History== Lungzubels are one of the historical treasures of the Biate tribe. However, the origin of the Lungzubels remains shrouded in obscurity. According to Biate legends and elders, erection and carving of stone monuments has been the cultural practice of the Biate tribe from time immemorial, the most popular among them viz. the Lungzubels, Lungmaicham (stone altar), etc. These stone monuments or relics are generally a pictogram of a successful or triumphant Biate chief or warriors who gained honour in the past. Moreover, the fact that rice beer used to play an important role in the rituals and festivals of the Biates in the past throw much light on why the Lungzubels were carved out. One theory also holds that these stone jars are the handiwork of Lamlira, a legendary Biate warrior who led the Biates to their present hills believed to be in the 12-13th century. ==Location== Lungzubels are not confined to a particular place but are spread out in all Biate inhabited areas in the southwestern part of Dima Hasao district and the adjoining state of Meghalaya across the Kangkalang (Kopili) river mainly in the Saipung Elaka, East Jaintia Hills district. Dr.B.Pakem, a renowned writer and former Vice-Chancellor of North Eastern Hill University also wrote that these round stones and hollow ground resemble those found in the nearby Sumer Elaka, between Umkyurpong and Kseh villages in Meghalaya. He believed that it might have been the sacrificial or dancing places of the Biates' forefathers in the past. In Dima Hasao, the most well-known location is a small Biate village called Khobak, about 130 km from the district headquarters Haflong. Lungzubels are also found in some other areas albeit in small numbers. It is widely believed that these places may also have been inhabited by the Biates in olden days. Lungzubel near Khobak Lungzubels in Saipung, Meghalaya ==Present condition and preservation== Most of the relics were gradually destroyed over time, by nature or man, as it was left abandoned and unguarded for a long time. It is believed that the advent of Christianity among the Biates in the 19th century could have been the main reason behind the neglect of these cultural treasures as Christianity doesn't encourage intoxicated drinks of any kind. Originally animists, conversion to the new faith may have led the Biates to abandon their age old practice of brewing rice beer which is still a practice among some of their neighboring brethren tribes. Encouragingly, because of the relentless efforts of the Biate Devanpui (Biate Apex Body) and the Biate Cultural Organization, Assam (BCOA), the importance of the relics and the need for its preservation have been acknowledged, and hence, as a result, Lungzubels around Khobak and its surrounding areas in Dima Hasao district are now being maintained and looked after by the Archaeological Dept. of the Department of Cultural Affairs, Assam. Moreover, with a view to promote tourism in the district as well as to showcase the Lungzubels to the world, Lungzubel festival was also organised by the Biate Cultural Organisation (BCO) of Assam, in collaboration with 22 Sector Assam Rifles, State Tourism Department and Archaeological Department and a Haflong-based NGO named Make a Difference (MaD) Society, on September 16, 2015 at Khobak where thousands of people from all spheres attended the day-long programme that included a pipe band display by the Assam Rifles and traditional dances performed by the local villagers belonging to the Biate community. The steps taken by the Assam Government has been commendable and the Lungzubels are now well looked after. Moreover, in the Assam Budget 2019-20, the Lungzubels at Khobak have been included in the list of eight important tourist/historical places of Dima Hasao district which will receive infrastructure upgradation grant as part of the \\"Asom Darshan\\" scheme launched by the Government of Assam as a tourism development initiative. This will go a long way in preserving and promoting the relics as well as in developing the areas around it. In the neighboring Meghalaya state, however, no concrete steps have been taken by the Government of Meghalaya to preserve the Lungzubels found in East Jaintia Hills district as of yet. They continue to be in a state of neglect. ==Connectivity== Khobak is well connected by an all weather motorable road and one can visit the place at any time of the year. It is located about 130 km from Haflong. ==References* Category:Archaeology of India Category:Cultural history of Assam Category:Dima Hasao district Category:Stone objects ","title":"Lungzubel"},{"id":"56567345","text":"Berdeniella is a genus of drain flies in the subfamily Psychodinae.

It was founded on 23 March 1953 and was transformed into its present form on Army Day, 22 December 2002 - one of the first generation Raider Battalions to be raised. One of the Banteng Raiders honorific honors the battalion being raised in response towards the threat posed by the Darul Islam's armed wing, the Tentara Islam Indonesia, in its area of operations as part of Kodam IV/Diponegoro territorial command, and its origins date back to 1950. It also took part in the events following the 1965 30 September Movement, wherein infantrymen from the Battalion were operationally deployed to Jakarta. (Ironically, the leader of the movement. Lt Col Untung Syamsuri, was a former commanding officer with the battalion.) The battalion today is stationed in Semarang in Central Java. == Brief history == In January 1950, the Darul Islam movement was beginning to threaten the peace in Central Java, just weeks after the Netherlands government awarded all its colonial processions to the United States of Indonesia, ending centuries of Dutch rule. To deal with the grave military situation in the province, given the worsening health of the then Commander of the Indonesian National Armed Forces Sudirman, the then Chief of Staff of the Army, Col Abdul Harris Nasution, through the commanding general of the then 4th Territorial Command Diponegoro, Col Gatot Soebroto, began the process of creating a commando formation to deal with the increasing presence of the DI's military arm the Tentara Islam Indonesia (Islamic Army of Indonesia). Thus was born what would be the basis of the 400th Raider Infantry Battalion - the National Freedom Bull Operational Command (Komando Gerakan Banteng Negara), under Lt Col Sarbini as its first commanding officer, who the following year was succeeded by future Chief of Staff of the Army, then Col Ahmad Yani and assisted by Lt Col Bachrum.https://infotegal.com/2011/02/sejarah-gerakan-banteng-nasional-gbn-di- tegal-jawa-tengah/ The Banteng Raiders, the military part of that operation, were raised as two independent special forces companies and a training company beginning in February 1950 in Tegal, Central Java. * 1 Company Banteng Raiders (Kompi BR I), with Cpt (INF) Pujadi as commander and with personnel from the 401st Infantry Btn./Rajawali, * 2 Company Banteng Raiders (Kompi BR II), with Cpt (INF) Yasir Hadibroto as commander and with personnel from the 402nd Infantry Btn.

His father Durgaprasad (1816‚Äì1850 or 1855) preferred Sannyas life and left home when Vishwanath was six years old only. There is an interesting incident when he longed to return to Calcutta after five years of wandering for sanyass which Swami Vivekananda used to listen in his childhood. It happened so that, in somewhere between 1845 or 1846 Durgaprasad returned to Calcutta, He was recognised by one of his neighbours who locked him in a tiny room in his house so he cannot escape and remain in a starving condition as Sanyassi. He was locked in this room for 3 days. At last, on the third day the neighbour's wife Sarita Devi took pity on him and helped him escape from the house. Later Vishwanath was brought up by his uncle. He entered in Gourmohan Addy's school or Oriental Seminary. After completion of graduation in 1879 Datta worked as a clerk under an attorney, Charles F. Peter. ==Career== Datta was an enlightened person of the 18th century, free from religious superstitions, known for his charity and liberal outlook. He was well versed in Sanskrit, Hindi, Persian, Arabic and Urdu languages. He married Bhuvaneswari Devi in 1851 and Swami Vivekananda was born in 1863. In 1866 he applied for the post of proctor to Sir Barnes Peacock, the first Chief Justice of Calcutta High Court. His prayer was approved by Justice Walter Morgan (judge). Datta also maintained a law firm in Kolkata named Dhar & Datta.

It‚Äôs extremely rare variety abietina is grown with the commoner var. hystricosa on coastal sand dunes. Abietinella abietina is a species which is perennial in terms of growing season, which means it can be found during all months of the year. == Characteristics == Abietinella abietina shoots are of either green or dark brown. The tips of the shoots are usually yellow or green. The shoots are once-pinnate which have branches in four rows (arranged with two on each side of the stem) in two planes. Secondary stems are the length of about 5‚Äì10 cm. The leaves of the stems of Abientinella abietina are broad and oval shaped. They are longitudinally ridged and have a broad base. The leaves of the branch are smaller compared to the leaves of the stem which are bigger. Abietinella abietina has the ability to grow stems which are about 2‚Äì8 cm in length (but rarely ever 12 cm). Branches arise in four ranks from these stems. The branches are often spread out at wide angles which result in sparse branches.

The hospital had 10 beds and was located in a rented house on Did≈æioji street. The initial tenancy agreement has been concluded for three years, then extended to 12 years at an annual rental fee of 300 rubles. In 1897 the hospital was relocated to its own wooden building donated by Victoria Totleben in memory of her late husband general Eduard Totleben. Later, the same Victoria Totleben commissioned to build a new hospital built of brick, which opened in 1900 and was named Kƒódainiai Eduard Totleben Village Hospital (today the building is occupied by a local Labour Exchange office). The hospital had 40 beds and its own electricity generator, as Kedainiai did not have a constant power supply at the time. In 1937, now under the local government's initiative, a new 75-bed hospital worth 330,000 litas was built nearby and named the Hospital Palace. However, the joy was short-lived as it was demolished by retreating Nazi army in 1944. Rescued equipment was moved to the Village Hospital, which again served the main hospital's function. Due to the shortage of beds and poor working conditions, the local government has repeatedly called the Lithuanian Ministers' council asking for funds to rebuild the demolished hospital. Eventually, in 1965 a new 240-bed hospital was built in the new location where it remains today. ==References== Category:Hospitals in Lithuania ","title":"Kƒódainiai Hospital"},{"id":"56567898","text":"Hutchison Vale F.C. are a women's football team that play in the Scottish Women's Premier League, in SWPL2.

Following a pulmonary haemorrhage in his early twenties, he went to the West Indies and found employment as a millwright at St Kitts. He remained there for several years, became acquainted with Dr. William Stephen, a brother of William Wilberforce‚Äôs legal adviser James Stephen, and joined with him in protesting the mistreatment of slaves on the island.James McCune Smith in Autographs for Freedom, ed. Julia Griffiths for The Rochester Ladies‚Äô Anti-Slavery Society (Boston: John P.Jewett & Co, 1853), pp. 62-67 ; Memoir of Annie Struthers, Glasgow, 1876, manuscript privately held. When Murray later laboured in the abolitionist cause, the Stephen connection fostered close co-operation between him and the Agency Committee of the Anti-Slavery Society led by George Stephen.First Annual Report of the Glasgow Emancipation Society, 1835, pp. 11-12; Rachael A. Jezierski, \\"The Glasgow Emancipation Society and the American Anti-Slavery Movement\\", PhD thesis, University of Glasgow, 2011, pp. 95, 99. ==Abolitionist work== While in the West Indies, Murray became committed to what historian Duncan Rice has called ‚Äòorganizational radicalism‚Äô. He was convinced that slaveholding and patronage ‚Äòwere forms of property ownership distorted to a point that made them the symbolic antithesis of vital Christianity‚Äô.C. Duncan Rice, The Scots Abolitionists 1833‚Äì1861 (Louisiana State University Press, 1981), p. 39. Returning to Scotland, he quickly identified himself with the abolitionist and other reform movements and became a member of the Glasgow Anti-Slavery Society on its formation in 1822. When that Society ceased to meet, following the abolition of slavery in the British colonies, he called for the establishment of a new association to work for the suppression of slavery worldwide. His appeals led to the Glasgow Emancipation Society being formed in December 1833 with the Quaker tea merchant William Smeal and himself as its executive officers.The Liberator, Vol. XIX, No. 23 (8 June 1849), p. 2 ; Jezierski, pp. 16 and 23, citing Glasgow Emancipation Society Minute Book, p. 1. In his footnotes to letter no. 13 in Vol. III of Garrison‚Äôs Letters (see sub [4]), Professor Merrill calls Murray the ‚Äòfounder‚Äô of the Society. The two men became ‚Äòthe soul of the Society‚Äô and their conduct of its affairs was largely autonomous.William Lloyd Garrison to Elizabeth Pease, 16 September 1841, printed in Letters of William Lloyd Garrison, Vol. III, ed.

Merrill (Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1973), letter no. 13, pp. 29-30; Annual Report of the Board of Management of the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society, 1842 (Boston, Dow & Jackson‚Äôs Press), p. 54; Howard Temperley, British Antislavery 1833-1870 (Longman, 1972), p. 211; Jezierski, pp. 34, 109. Its object was the global abolition of slavery, and the Society was able to build on a vibrant local tradition of both abolitionism and benevolence.Rice, The Scots Abolitionists, p. 40. Their administrative efficiency was evidenced in 1838 when more than 100,000 signatures were collected for the Society‚Äôs petition demanding an end to the ‚Äòapprenticeship‚Äô of freed slaves in the West Indies ‚Äî a powerful response by the Empire‚Äôs second city to Lord Melbourne‚Äôs negative stance at a meeting with Murray and other Glasgow delegates a few months earlier.Caledonian Mercury, 30 June 1838; The Scotsman, 3 January 1838. In 1840 Murray was a delegate to the World Anti-Slavery Convention in London; there his proposed scheme for protecting the African continent against slavery was tabled.Proceedings of the General Anti-Slavery Convention called by the Committee of the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society and held in London from Friday June 12th to Thursday 23rd June 1840 (London, British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society, 1841), pp. 507-8, 550-51, 580. Shortly afterward a schism occurred in the Glasgow Society and, as part of the reordering of its affairs, Murray was appointed Corresponding Secretary while Smeal became Minutes Secretary and Treasurer.Seventh Annual Report of the Glasgow Emancipation Society, 1841, p. 8. In practice, Murray may always have led the conduct of the Society‚Äôs communications. He ‚Äòused more than one ream of paper for manuscripts upon the great cause which he seemed born to carry out‚Äô, supplying information and argument to other abolitionist organisations, arranging speaking engagements, preparing addresses and resolutions, and bombarding political leaders at home and abroad with reasoned protests and carefully formulated proposals.James McCune Smith, ut supra; Anti-Slavery Reporter, CXIX, Vol. V, p. 131; Temperley, pp. 23-24. From its birth, the Glasgow Emancipation Society prioritized pressing for British support for the abolitionist struggle in America. Murray identified himself with William Lloyd Garrison‚Äôs demands for immediate and unconditional freedom of slaves; he read Garrison‚Äôs ‚ÄòAppeal to the Friends of Negro Emancipation throughout Great Britain‚Äô (August 1833) to the assembly that resolved to form the SocietyJezierski, p. 97. and later established a warm personal rapport with Garrison and other leaders of the American abolitionist cause who visited Glasgow, often accommodating them at his home and pressing his own money on them for travel expenses.William Lloyd Garrison to Elizabeth Pease, 16 September 1841; John Murray, Bowling Bay, to William Lloyd Garrison, 30 October 1846 ; William Lloyd Garrison to Henry C. Wright, 23 September 1846 (Letters Vol. III, letter no. 171 at p. 426), and see Garrison‚Äôs tribute to Murray as \\"one of the earliest, most faithful and intrepid, most exemplary and self-sacrificing advocates of the slave in the old world\\" in The Liberator, Vol. XIX, No. 23 (8 June 1849), p. 1.

Among others from the American movement on familiar terms with Murray was Frederick Douglass, who described him as ‚Äòthe firm, the untiring, the devoted friend of the slave‚Äô and captured the force of Murray‚Äôs commitment when recalling the campaign for the Free Church of Scotland to return American slaveowners‚Äô donations: ‚ÄòWhile he lived that Church obtained no repose.‚ÄôThe Liberator, Vol. XIX, No. 23, p. 2. ==Other activism== From 1841 onwards the Glasgow Emancipation Society became increasingly militant not only in the abolitionist interest but across a range of issues dear to its officers, including international peace, constitutional reform, and temperance. Murray was prominent in the Glasgow Anti-War Society, sat on the committee of the Glasgow Voluntary Society (committed to disestablishment of the Church), called for total abstinence, and was a delegate to the International Peace Congress at London in 1843 and Brussels in 1848.Jezierski, pp. 25, 110; The Proceedings of the First General Peace Conference Held in London, 1843, p. 44; Memoir of Annie Struthers, ut supra. On returning from the West Indies he had set up as a spirit merchant but, becoming convinced of the evil of strong liquor, he gave up the trade and donated his stock to Glasgow Royal Infirmary. When he declined to drink or serve fermented wine at the Lord‚Äôs Supper of Old Kilpatrick Relief Church, he was removed from his position as an elder of the Church; on his appealing against such removal, the Paisley Presbytery expelled him from membership of the Church, and when he carried the matter onward to the Synod his expulsion was confirmed.The Scotsman, 19 May 1841. Even as early as 1841 the wide-ranging radicalism of his views was observed by Nathaniel Peabody Rogers: ‚ÄòIf there is a revolution in Scotland within twenty years, the name of John Murray will not be undistinguished in its history.‚ÄôA Collection from the Miscellaneous Writings of Nathaniel Peabody Rogers (W. H. Fisk, Manchester, NH, and B. B. Musdey & Co., Boston), 1849, at p. 130 (extract from Herald of Freedom, 30 April 1841). Rogers described Murray as \\"a noble, Robert-Bruce looking man... tall, gaunt, palpably made as the stranger beholds him for times of trouble and peril\\". Ibid. at pp. 128, 130. ==Legacy== Shortly after the death of the American statesman Henry Clay in 1852, James McCune Smith compared the legacy of Clay‚Äôs forty years at the heart of American public life with the enduring achievements of John Murray. In favour of the latter, he declared, ‚ÄòI cannot help thinking how much more has been done for the cause of human progress by this faithful servant to his own convictions of the truth.‚ÄôJames McCune Smith, ut supra. ==Service with Forth & Clyde Canal Company== Murray‚Äôs paternal family had intermarried with the influential Oswalds of Shieldhall, and he was able to engage the support of his kinsman James Oswald, MP for Glasgow, for some of the Emancipation Society‚Äôs initiatives. Oswald later became one of the Society‚Äôs Vice- Presidents, and he was also instrumental in obtaining employment for Murray with the Forth and Clyde Canal Company.James McCune Smith, ut supra; Jezierski, p. 118. While an inspector of works for the Company in 1828, Murray recommended the navigational trials which ultimately led to the Canal being used by steam vessels, thereby overcoming the generally prevailing prejudice against such use and resulting in the Canal becoming the principal conduit for Glasgow-manufactured goods to the ports on the Firth of Forth.\\"Improvements in Canal Navigation\\", The Mechanics‚Äô Magazine, vol. 15, pp. 297-302, at p. 299. He was subsequently made Collector for the Company. This appointment brought with it the house at Bowling Bay which was visited by many transatlantic abolitionists.William Lloyd Garrison to Henry C.

These include a broad range of land use and land cover changes, such as agricultural clearance, lumbering and clearance of native vegetation, mining, road building, urbanization, as well as alterations brought to river systems in the form of dams and other engineering structures meant to control and regulate natural fluvial processes (erosion, deposition, lateral migration, meandering). The concept of LS is used in geomorphology, ecology, as well as in water quality and toxicological studies. LS is distributed in spatially heterogeneous ways throughout a landscape and accumulates to form various landforms. It can progress through the fluvial system through facies changes from hillslope colluvium, to floodplain and wetland alluvium, to fine-grained lacustrine and estuarine slackwater deposits. The temporal nature of LS is time-transgressive, meaning that initiation and peak rates of deposition can take place at different times within a fluvial system, as well as at different times between regions. The intermittent transport of LS can be thought of as a cascading system that reworks LS deposits from hillslopes, into channels and onto floodplains, such that anthropogenic sediment will be mixed with and non-anthropogenic sediment. River systems record past and present imprints of anthropogenically-forced changes to the environment. LS is an element of change in this context, as it drives fluxes of energy and matter (connectivity) through fluvial systems and provides indication of past land-uses and river dynamics that can inform future trajectories of river response. In this sense, acknowledging the concept of LS can benefit informed policy development in stream restorationn, water quality and sediment budget management, protection of aquatic ecosystems, and flood risk. Moreover, the implications of legacy effects associated with anthropogenically modified sediment dynamics are critical in the context of ecosystem services. == Definitions == === Post-settlement alluvium === Definitions predominantly indicate post-settlement alluvium in North America created as a result of agricultural clearance. > ‚ÄúLegacy Sediment (n.) Sediment that (1) was eroded from upland slopes during > several centuries of intensive land clearing, agriculture, and milling (in > the eastern U.S., this occurred from the late 17th to late 19th Centuries); > (2) collected along stream corridors and valley bottoms, burying pre- > settlement streams, floodplains, wetlands, and dry valleys; and that altered > the hydrologic, biologic, aquatic, riparian, and chemical functions of pre- > settlement streams and floodplains; (3) accumulated behind ubiquitous low- > head mill dams in slackwater environments, resulting in thick accumulations > of fine-grained sediment, which distinguishes ‚Äò‚Äòlegacy sediment‚Äô‚Äô from > fluvial deposits associated with meandering streams; (4) can also accumulate > as coarser grained, more poorly sorted colluvial (not associated with stream > transport) deposits, usually at valley margins; (5) can contain varying > amounts of total phosphorus and nitrogen, which contribute to nutrient loads > in downstream waterways from bank erosion processes. . .‚Äô‚Äô === Anthropogenically-caused episodic sedimentary deposits === As a result of criticism related to the limited scope and applicability of this definition, a more flexible and generic definition has been proposed that (1) includes a broader range of human activities, (2) considers more sediment types apart from post-settlement alluvium, and (3) respects the spatial (nonuniform) and temporal (time-transgressive) variability of LS: == Types and related landforms == === Types === LS encompasses sediment of differing structures and textures. They can be colluvial, containing poorly sorted, angular rock fragments deposited by mass wasting or sheet erosional processes, alluvial, containing well sorted, rounded clasts and very-fine grained suspended sediment deposited by fluvial processes. === Associated landforms === Most LS is generated on highlands by erosional processes related to mass-wasting, sheet flow, rills and gullies. The deposited colluvium has a low travel distance and accumulates in midslope drapes near the site of erosion, in aprons or sediment wedges at the base of the slope or in fans at the mouth of gullies, debris flows and tributaries. Floodplains store alluvium through lateral and vertical accretion, i.e. bedload deposits are being incorporated into the floodplain. Depositional episodes reflect the balance between the amount of sediments available and the capacity for it to be transported. Accordingly, the nature of LS on floodplains can be of different nature: (1) graded, when an excess of sediment and a deficit in transport capacity buries floodplains in continuous deposits, (2) cascading, when abundant sediment and limited transport capacity results in a series of frequent, but separated pockets, (3) punctuated, when limited sediment supply but efficient transport leads to deposition only in locally isolated pockets. In low energy environments like lakes, wetlands, estuaries, LS are dominated by very fine- grained material, such as silts and clays, and form beaches and beach-dune complexes. === Source to sink relationships === Another way to conceptualize the spatial pattern of LS throughout a watershed is through the notion of source and storage or sink zones. Stores differentiate themselves from sinks through their temporal persistence in the landscape, the first being temporary, while the second are more long-lasting. Highlands are characterized by local storage points near the sediment production zone, with larger storage spaces downstream in wider valleys with low gradients. Stores in this parts of a watershed have generally low residence times, as they are episodically reworked by the fluvial system. Sources are linked to sinks through transport or transfer zones, generally characterized by either high transport capacity or little accommodation space for sediment to accumulate in, e.g. steep narrow valleys that are highly effective in transferring sediment downstream. Sinks are most common in low-lying, low gradient areas where flow energy is dissipated across large surfaces, so that accumulation is dominant. Here, storage space and residence time of the deposits increases considerably relative to upstream parts of a watershed. == Legacy effects == Scientific studies documenting the widespread alteration of sediment dynamics (i.e. sediment supply, sediment entrainment, transport, erosion, deposition and storage) by humans lead to the evidence that human activities have come to dominate erosional, depositional and geochemical processes in ecosystems. This is especially pronounced in river systems, given that rivers are the lowest topographic points of any landscape and consequently collect water, solutes, mineral sediment and particular organic matter from the landscape, but also precipitation, solutes and particulates from the atmosphere. Furthermore, increased sediment supply to rivers but reduced sediment transport within a fluvial network resulted in the creation of legacy effects along almost all rivers across the world. For example, even though accelerated anthropogenic soil erosion has increased sediment transport of rivers across the globe by 2.3 (¬± 0.6) billion metric tons per year, sediment delivery to the world's coasts and oceans has been reduced by 1.4 (¬± 0.3) billion metric tons per year because of retention within reservoirs. More than 50% of the major watersheds over the world are impacted by dams. In the United States alone, it is estimated that only 2% of river kilometers are not affected by dams. Human activities lead to legacy effects on river sediments, which manifest themselves as changes to the location, amount and composition of sediments. Legacy effects are temporally and spatially variable and the resulting sediment have varying spatial extents, accumulation rates and residence times within a river system. For example, removal of beaver dams may initially cause local sedimentation within a portion of basin that comprises solely a few hectares. Similarly, one milldam constructed within a river enhances deposition of sediment over several hectares. Conversely, construction of hundreds of kilometers of bank revetment structures, such as levees, has a much more extensive impact across a basin of nearly eliminating overbank sedimentation. Likewise, removal of native vegetation within an upland region of a basin may lead to significant aggradation of valley bottoms along almost the entire course of a river network. Wastewater treatment can remove contaminated sediment within less than a year, but heavy metals and synthetic chemicals may remain within river sediments at toxic standards for decades to centuries. Three main effects of anthropogenic manipulation of ecosystems are to enhance sedimentation, to reduce or eliminate sedimentation and/or to contaminate sediments with various pollutants. === Enhanced sedimentation === Sedimentation is enhanced by activities that either increase sediment supply to the river from upstream (e.g. agricultural clearing, mining, grazing) or other parts of the watershed or decrease the transport capacity of the river (e.g. flow regulation). The effects thereof may induce river metamorphosis, i.e. a whole-shift alteration of river morphology. For example, changing crops from grains to potatoes in late 19th century Poland resulted in such increased sediment yields, that meandering rivers metamorphosed into braided rivers. Copper mining in the headwaters of the Ok Tedi River in Papua New Guinea generated about 80 thousand tonnes per day of waste tailings and 121 thousand tonnes per day of mined wasted rock, which were discarded in the river and affected the entire course of the river network, as well as the nearshore environment. The river system responded by aggrading over 6 meters in parts of the basin a decade later. In California, the Bear River still continues to rework and move down sediment generated by mining activities more than a century after these stopped. Indirectly, climate change can also enhance sedimentation through changes in precipitation and discharge patterns, which have been shown to result in increased mass movements, alterations of wildfire regimes and increased glacial melting. === Reduced sedimentation === Sedimentation is reduced or removed altogether when human activities reduce sediment yields from upstream (e.g. dams and reservoirs within upland regions, sediment detention basins) or reduce the river channel's physical complexity (e.g. channelization, drainage) or disconnect river channels from adjacent floodplains and wetlands (e.g. levees, removal of beaver dams and logjams/large woody debris). Rapid dam construction in the Mekong River system resulted in 38 dams (as of 2014) and an additional 133 proposed for the main stream and its tributary streams ‚Äì if all of these were to be constructed, the overall sediment trapping capacity would be 96%. Estimates show that about 100 billion metric tons of sediment are presently stored in reservoirs that have been constructed over the past 50 years. Levee construction in the lower Mississippi River reduced overbank flows by 90%. Bank stabilization measures associated with this project reduced bank erosion and meander lateral migration, while dikes induced bed scour during low flows due to increased flow velocity. Overall, this project lead to a decrease of sediment storage on the floodplain from 89,600 to 7,000 square kilometers between 1882‚Äì2000. In Australia's Cann River, wood removal from the channel transformed downstream segments of the river network from a sediment sink to a sediment source. === Contaminated sedimentation === Human activities introduce or concentrate naturally occurring (e.g. nitrogen, phosphorus) or synthetic contaminants and pollutants that get absorbed in sediments and may lead, at toxic levels, to chronic or severe disruption of physiologic mechanisms in all organisms. The most common contaminants that can absorb fine sediment are trace metals, nutrients (e.g. nitrogen, phosphorus), polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), pathogens, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), pesticides, volatile organic compounds (VOCs). For instance, two tailing dams of gold mines located in Romanian tributaries of the Danube failed, thereby releasing vast amounts of cyanide-contaminated water and sediment for tens of kilometers downstream, which killed riverine organisms and affected human drinking-water supply for weeks. In the Rio San Juan basin of Peru, acid mine drainage was diverted into a natural lake, leading to extremely high concentrations copper, zinc and lead in the lake sediments. Samples taken by the USGS during 1993-2003 showed that median concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus in agricultural streams are six times greater than background levels and that, across the US, concentrations in streams commonly lie above levels recommended by the US Environmental Protection Agency in order to protect aquatic life. == See also == * Great Raft * Vulnerable waters == Further reading == * Wohl, E.

After the death of his father, in 1868, he resolved the problems of the division of the inheritance that could have meant the liquidation of the flourishing enterprise. Florio, Ignazio, senior, by Simone Candela, Treccani Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani - Volume 48 (1997) The other heirs, his sisters Giuseppina and Angelina, were not interested in the family businesses and preferred the payment of their parts. This required cash outflows of over 4 million lire, corresponding to more than a third of the value of all assets. Ignazio succeeded in dealing with the financial effort without affecting the productive activities. Free from constraints, he set about to consolidate and further develop the business empire. In 1874, Ignazio Florio Sr. purchased the island of Favignana and the whole archipelago of the Aegadian Islands in order to expand the tuna business started by his family. Over time he brought the flotilla of the paternal shipping line Societa in Accomandita Piroscafi Postali-Ignazio & Vicenzo Florio (Florio Line) to a hundred units and in 1881 merged with the Rubattino company in Genoa, giving rise to the Navigazione Generale Italiana.Florio Line / Societ√† in Accomandita Piroscafi Postali-Ignazio & Vicenzo Florio, TheShipsList (retrieved 13 April 2018) At the time of the merger, the Florio Line was already a major company with a monopoly of the trade in the Mediterranean.

G. Wodehouse and a Mr. Mulliner story. It was published in Playboy magazine in the US in January 1967. The story was also included in the 1966 collection Plum Pie.McIlvaine (1990), pp. 99-100, A89. An earlier version of the story featured Reggie Pepper and was published as \\"Rallying Round Old George\\" in The Strand Magazine in December 1912. An American edition of this story was published in Collier's Weekly on 27 September 1913, titled \\"Brother Alfred\\".McIlvaine (1990), p. 145, D15.9, and p. 183, D133.25. In \\"George and Alfred\\", Mr. Mulliner goes to Monte Carlo, along with his nephew George, who gets into trouble after getting drunk. To help George, Mr. Mulliner comes up with an idea that takes advantage of the fact that George has a twin brother, Alfred. ==Plot== At The Angler's Rest pub, the topic of twins arises, and Mr. Mulliner recounts the following story involving his nephews, the identical twins George and Alfred. Alfred is a magician in London professionally known as \\"The Great Alfredo\\", while George is a low-ranking scriptwriter in Hollywood, being essentially a yes-man to his boss Jacob Schnellenhamer. Mr. Mulliner befriends Schnellenhamer and sees George on Schnellenhamer's yacht heading to Monte Carlo. George is eager to collect an inheritance left to him by his godmother from his trustee, P. P. Bassinger, in Monaco. At Monte Carlo, Mr. Mulliner is surprised to see Alfred, who is performing at the Casino. Mr. Mulliner tells Alfred that he is with the filmmaker Schnellenhamer. Alfred leaves for rehearsal before Mr. Mulliner can tell him that George has also come. Later, Schnellenhamer says that Sam Glutz, whom Schnellenhamer came to Monte Carlo to do business with, was mugged and knocked out near the Casino. He was found by a passer-by and taken to a hospital. Sergeant Brichoux of the Monaco police arrives, looking for George Mulliner. George's wallet was found near where Glutz was mugged. Concerned, Mr. Mulliner looks for George. He finds George, who had been drinking because Bassinger gambled George's inheritance away and ran off to South America. George remarks that he dreamed he had brawled with someone. Mr. Mulliner concludes that George must have mugged Sam Glutz when drunk. He tells George to flee, but George's passport is on the yacht. George cannot get it while the police are around, and he says his uncle would never find it. George resigns himself to his fate, saying of life, \\"You can't win\\". Mr. Mulliner, hearing \\"twin\\", gets an idea: George will retrieve his passport pretending to be Alfred. On the yacht, a man claiming to be Alfred shows up and pitches an idea to Schnellenhamer to include a magician in his next film. Mr. Mulliner realizes this is actually Alfred. Alfred goes further into the yacht to get materials to demonstrate his tricks, and then George appears, pretending to be Alfred. Sergeant Brichoux is about to arrest George when a bandaged man, Sam Glutz, approaches. Schnellenhamer tells him that they have the mugger, George, and that he has fired George. However, Sam reveals that George actually saved his life by fending off the mugger. Sam hires George and promises him a large salary. Sam, George and Mr. Mulliner leave to have lunch. Meanwhile, Alfred returns to demonstrate his tricks to Schnellenhamer. ==Differences between editions== There are many differences between the Mr. Mulliner and Reggie Pepper versions of the story. In the Reggie Pepper story, Reggie's friend George Lattaker kisses the maid Emma Pilbeam out of sheer joy when he gets engaged to Stella Vanderley, but Stella sees this and ends their engagement. (Voules, Reggie's valet, also ended his engagement to Emma after seeing George kiss her.) This induces George to drink, and he vaguely remembers getting into a brawl. Also, George is due to receive a legacy from his trustee, his uncle Augustus Arbutt, but is told that he must wait because a man is claiming to be George's long-lost twin brother Alfred. The Prince of Saxburg-Liegnitz gets mugged near the Casino, and George is suspected. Reggie suggests that George pretend to be Alfred to avoid arrest. George discovers later that the uncle invented the twin brother to buy time to flee after gambling away George's money. Voules finds out about George pretending to be Alfred, and Reggie bribes him to remain silent. Count Fritz von C√∂slin, the Prince's equerry, reveals that George saved the Prince's life. Voules suddenly appears, now wealthy and outspoken after a winning streak at the casino; seeking revenge on George for kissing Emma, he betrays George's identity, and is surprised when the Count wants to reward George. Voules reconciles with Emma. Reggie fires him, but Voules was planning to quit anyway. The plots of the British and American editions of the Reggie Pepper story are essentially the same, though in the latter edition, Reggie Pepper and his friends are American rather than British. Reggie's valet Voules is still English; Reggie introduces him as \\"an Englishman who had spent most of his time valeting earls, and looked it\\". ==Background== The references to Hollywood in the Mulliner story \\"George and Alfred\\" were inspired by Wodehouse's experience as a scriptwriter in Hollywood in the 1930s. ==Publication history== The Reggie Pepper story \\"Rallying Round Old George\\", published in 1912 in the Strand, credited both Wodehouse and Herbert Westbrook (who would collaborate with Wodehouse on the stage adaptation of the story) as authors. This story was illustrated by Charles Crombie.McIlvaine (1990), p. 183, D133.25. The American edition titled \\"Brother Alfred\\", which only credited Wodehouse as the author, was illustrated by Wallace Morgan in Collier's.McIlvaine (1990), p. 145, D15.9. The Mulliner story \\"George and Alfred\\" was illustrated by Bill Charmatz in Playboy.McIlvaine (1990), p. 154, D51.16. \\"Rallying Round Old George\\" was collected in the American edition of The Man with Two Left Feet in 1917, and in the UK collection My Man Jeeves in 1919.McIlvaine (1990), pp. 33-34, A21b and A22a. \\"George and Alfred\\" was featured in the 1972 collection The World of Mr. Mulliner, and in the 1985 collection of Hollywood-related Wodehouse stories, The Hollywood Omnibus.McIlvaine (1990), pp. 115-115, B5b, and pp. 129-130, B33a. The British edition of the Reggie Pepper story was featured, under the American edition title \\"Brother Alfred\\", in the collection Enter Jeeves, published in 1997 by Dover Publications. This collection includes all the Reggie Pepper stories and several early Jeeves stories.Wodehouse (1997), pp. ii-v. ==Adaptations== The Reggie Pepper version of the story was adapted into a play titled Brother Alfred, co-written by Wodehouse and Herbert Westbrook. The play, produced by and starring Lawrence Grossmith, was performed in April 1913 at the Savoy Theatre in London.McIlvaine (1990), pp. 301, J7.

She faced discrimination from golf administrators because of his working class occupation. In 1955 she married Roy Smith, a Scottish Airlines pilot killed in a 1957 crash in Libya. They had one daughter. Stephens curtailed her playing career to raise her daughter, but subsequently was active in golf administration and developing junior golf. She was made OBE for \\"services to Ladies Golf\\" in the 1977 New Year Honours, a year before her death from cancer. ==Golf career== Stephens' home club was Royal Birkdale. She won the British Ladies Amateur in 1949 and 1954, and was runner-up in 1951 and 1952. She played in all six Curtis Cups from 1950 to 1960, and was non-playing captain of the Great Britain and Ireland team in 1962 and 1972. Her final-hole victories over Polly Riley in the 1956 and 1958 tournaments secured a win and a draw respectively for the British team, the first time it retained the cup.

It was discovered on 30 September 2014, by NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer telescope (WISE) in Earth's orbit. Closely observed at Goldstone and Arecibo in February 2018, it has a rotation period of 8.7 hours. == Orbit and classification == is a member of the Apollo asteroids, which cross the orbit of Earth. Apollo's are the largest group of near-Earth objects with nearly 10 thousand known objects. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.90‚Äì1.70 AU once every 18 months (541 days; semi-major axis of 1.30 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.30 and an inclination of 30¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. With an aphelion of 1.70 AU, it is also a Mars- crosser, as it crosses the orbit of the Red Planet at 1.666 AU. The body's observation arc begins with its official discovery observation by WISE in September 2014. === Close approaches === As a potentially hazardous asteroid, has a minimum orbital intersection distance (MOID) with Earth of less than 0.05 AU and a diameter of greater than 150 meters. The Earth-MOID is currently , which translates into 13.8 lunar distances (LD). === 2018 flyby=== On 7 February 2018 it passed from the Earth when its apparent magnitude brightened to 14. Goldstone observed it until the following day. While this was an 8.1-million kilometer flyby, the next close flyby of 6.3 million km will occur on 5 February 2058, and another 7.6 million km on 8 February 2095. It will also have a 3.2 million km flyby of Mars on 26 September 2048. == Physical characteristics == The asteroid's spectral type is unknown. Due to its unusually low albedo (see below) it is likely a carbonaceous C-type asteroid. === Rotation period === On 9 February, radiometric observations by the Arecibo Observatory revealed that the asteroid has an elongated, lumpy shape. The radar images also gave it a rotational period between 8 and 9 hours. A refined period of 8.7 hour agrees with (photometric) lightcurve observations by American photometrist Brian Warner at the Center for Solar System Studies () during 9‚Äì11 February 2018, who obtained a period of 8.729 hours with a high brightness amplitude of 0.93 magnitude, which also indicates a non-spheroidal shape (). === Diameter and albedo === According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's WISE telescope, measures 0.971 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.068. During its close approach in February 2018, radiometric observations by Arecibo Observatory determined that the object is at least wide. == Numbering and naming == This minor planet was numbered by the Minor Planet Center on 4 November 2017 ().

The name of the village goes back to the silver works that was existed here until 1912 and which smelted the ores from the mines around Sankt Andreasberg. According to Lie√ümann (2003), the smelting of the ores was carried out here soon after the opening of the Sankt Andreasberg silver mines. These naturally had a raised arsenic content. The silver works was located at the confluence of the W√§schegrundbach and the Sperrlutter - so that there was enough water power to drive the machines in the smeltery. Not only did the smelting workers here have to endure toxic emissions but, even in older accounts, there is talk of the massive nuisance caused by toxic, arsenic-containing, fumes from the smeltery which, in unfavourable weather conditions, swept into the town and occasionally forced the people living there to flee. The first smelting works are recorded at this locality around 1550. At the beginning of the Thirty Years' War, the smeltery was sold and demolished. When the silver mining industry flourished again in the 1680s, a new larger smelting works was built, which - rebuilt and extended several times - was in operation until 1912. In 1836, the responsible mining authority allowed the construction of a separate arsenic works on the Silberh√ºtte site. In addition to arsenic trioxide, a toxic white powder, arsenic glass was also produced. Handling the powdery poison was very difficult. The workers were only sent into the chimneys to sweep the arsenic with a damp cloth in front of their faces - without a special bonus, hardly any worker was willing to sweep the arsenic dust. A contemporary report by master smelter, Seidensticker, stated that, \\"the arsenic trioxide produced cannot be weighed because this would cause disproportionately high costs and endanger workers' health more than the rest of the arsenic work put together.\\" == Closure of the silver works == Around 1900, there were discussions about closing silver smeltery, but this was not carried out straight away out of consideration for its employees. After the Samson Pit had been taken out of service, ores from overseas were smelted until it was finally decommissioned in 1912. This delay was intended to cushion the loss of jobs in Sankt Andreasberg. The land and buildings were sold to wood-processing and other trades on the condition that it should create jobs. In the following years, however, it became clear that this requirement could not be fulfilled. Most of the silver smelting works were purchased by Rudolph Alberti, who temporarily operated the Harz \\"Gl√ºck Auf\\" factory at this location, but they were all shut down in 1929. That same year the timber works and crate factory, which had also been located on the site, closed. == Metallwerke Silberh√ºtte/Schmiedag AG == During 1934m Federstahl AG Kassel bought the land and real estate of the \\"Gl√ºck Auf\\" works. In addition, further plots of land and real estate were purchased by Bauholzwerke und Kistenfabrik St. Andreasberg, the Prussian State Forestry Commission, the firm of C. F. Hertwig and Mr and Mrs Albrecht. In October that year, Federstahl AG Kassel moved its headquarters to Sankt Andreasberg and changed its name to Metallwerke Silberh√ºtte. By November 1934, it announced it was starting work. At first, however, major construction work was necessary, which took more than a year; construction activity was brisk during autumn and winter 1935. The management's report for 1935 states that in Shed I, which was located on the site of the former \\"Gl√ºck Auf\\" works, hunting cartridges were to be produced and in Shed II, which was located on the premises of the former timber and box factory, steel boats were to be produced. Shed III, which was on land owned by C. F. Hertwig, was leased to[Schmiedag] in Hagen/Westphalia. Production started in 1936. Shed I produced infantry ammunition for the standard Wehrmacht rifle, Shed II produced clips for rifle ammunition, and Shed III was leased to Vereinigte Gesenkschmiede (Schmiedag), which produced shell cases for artillery ammunition. In July 1935, 44 workers and employees were employed on converting existing buildings and constructing new ones. A year later, when production started, the number of employees had already risen to 143, and the number of employees continued to rise in the following years, from 336 in July 1937 to 348 in July and 348 in July. In 1938, 16,562,000 rounds of ammunitation were manufactured at Shed I, and in 1940 the factory was expanded with the addition of air-raid shelters and laboratory buildings. In Shed II, where production also began in 1936, \\"strip-iron products\\" were manufactured from 1937 onwards, and there is no longer any indications of steel boat production. In 1938, 8,900,000 clips were produced. The company also invested in Shed II in 1940 by purchasing a low-voltage machine. As the war started, production and weekly working hours increased and two-shift operation was introduced. As a result of the war, production figures continued to rise, although the quantities demanded by the army were not attained, with the exception of a few months. The demand for labour increased, so that from 1942 onwards, Soviet forced labourers were employed. The production of the ammunition clips was moved to Shed I in order to erect RAD barracks on the site where the forced labourers were accommodated. In addition, residents of Sankt Andreasberg were required to work and skilled workers recruited by the Wehrmacht were recalled from duty. On 1 April 1945, the workforce comprised 1,141 people, including 374 workers, 36 salaried employees and 731 foreigners. The village of Silberh√ºtte was captured without a fight by the US Army on 14 April and the forced labourers were freed. However, shortly afterwards, they were interned again in the same camp as before and transported away on 20 June 1945. The facilities were plundered after 14 April 1945. The dismantling of the remaining facilities was completed by 1950. Afterwards, the properties were put to industrial re-use. == British Army Mountain Training Camp (AMTC) == Until 1990, the Army Mountain Training Camp (AMTC) of the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR) was located on the site of Shed II. The camp offered space for a maximum of 200 people. Here, BAOR soldiers were trained in various skills such as skiing, mountaineering and climbing as well as survival techniques. == Pollution == In 2004, a study by the Lower Saxony State Office for Consumer Protection and Food Safety (LAVES) on heavy metal pollution in red deer and roe deer, found high concentrations of lead and cadmium in the area of the silver smelting works in their livers and kidneys and partly also in their muscles. However, the residues of arsenic, antimony and mercury in muscles and storage organs were only small. The levels of cadmium in the organs exceeded the residue levels of the EU's Contaminants Regulation, in some cases, considerably. However, this regulation does not apply to the meat and edible tissues of wild game. There are copies of the investigation report in the forest offices at Lauterberg and Riefensbeek. In 2005, the Lower Saxony Forestry Office in Lauterberg had around 6,000 tonnes of contaminated hazardous waste disposed of from the site above the Silberh√ºtte - stockpile material from the smelting works and contaminated soils as well as residues from flue gas ducts and chimneys. The materials were highly contaminated with arsenic and heavy metals. The buildings had simply been destroyed after the closure of the hut and remained on site. Investigations of the site revealed that the area had to be cleaned. Excavators removed the contaminated material. Afterwards, the excavated area was covered with unpolluted soil and a loose layer of mountain meadow hay was laid out to prepare for reforestation. With this remediation, the district of Goslar as the licensing authority and the Lower Saxony Forestry Office of Lauterberg as the land owner also took precautions for water protection in the planned \\"P√∂hlder Becken\\" water protection area. == Literature == * * Lie√ümann, W.

Elsheikh has denied being a member of \\"the Beatles\\" but admits joining the ISIL terrorist group. ==Early life== Born in Sudan,Dearden, Lizzie (31 March 2018) \\"Isis 'Beatles' militants captured in Syria accuse government of breaking law by removing British citizenship\\", The Independent Elsheikh spent his youth in London, England. The Daily Telegraph reports he was a follower of a local football team, Queen's Park Rangers, and dreamed of joining the team when he grew up. ==Allegations of ties to terrorism== In 2014 and 2015, Daesh held dozens of European and North American captives, and the brutal conditions of their detention was widely reported. Four English- speaking Daesh fighters played a central role in the brutality. Their identities were initially either not known or security officials did not make their identities known to the public, so the press dubbed the four as The Beatles, with Mohammed Emwazi, the most well-known being known of the group, having been dubbed Jihadi John. Later, Elsheikh was reported to have been one of the other three Beatles. On March 30, 2017, Elsheikh and four other men were named as suspected terrorists, by the US State Department, under Executive Order 13224. This Executive Order signed by President George W. Bush, shortly after al Qaeda's attacks on September 11, 2001, allowed the State Department to bar US citizens, US financial institutions, and other US corporations, from having any financial transactions with designated individuals. Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) captured Elsheikh, and his friend Alexanda Kotey, on January 24, 2018. as he was fleeing from the collapse of Daesh, the short-lived \\"Islamic State\\". The pair were reported to have been trying to blend in with genuine civilian refugees, fleeing the collapse of the last Daesh enclaves. ==Prosecution== The Independent reported that the United Kingdom government was considering agreeing that Kotey and Elsheikh could be transferred to the Guantanamo detention camps. Detention in Guantanamo could be indefinite detention, without charge, if transferred to US custody. For a civilian trial, they would likely be detained at the Supermax prison in Florence, Colorado, if they were convicted. The Independent described how bleak conditions would be at the Florence Supermax, confinement to a featureless cell, for 23 hours a day, practically no human contact, exercise periods in a small featureless courtyard, near their cell. Another option under consideration is trial at the International Court in the Hague. According to The Independent, the UK government would first strip Kotey and Elsheikh of UK citizenship, prior to agreeing to transfer to the Hague. The Guardian quoted Tobias Ellwood, the UK Minister of Defence, who argued that transfer to Guantanamo was inappropriate. In a face-to-face interview with Jenan Moussa of Al Aan TV in Koban√Æ, Syria, at the beginning of April 2018 Elsheikh said he was interviewed by US and Syrian Democratic Forces officials, but not by UK officials. On 7 October 2020, Elsheikh and Alexanda Kotey were brought to the United States to face charges of beheading western hostages. == References == Category:1988 births Category:British people imprisoned abroad Category:Living people ","title":"El Shafee Elsheikh"},{"id":"56569384","text":"Monk 'n' More is an album by Simon Nabatov.

The cemetery is still operational and is under the control of Perth and Kinross Council. In general the grounds are well-landscaped and well- maintained but with some minor vandalism in the central sections. Unlike many council cemeteries stones are not laid flat if considered dangerous but instead are marked with caution tapes. ==History== The cemetery was opened in 1844 as a private cemetery. The original section and original entrance gates lie to the south-east. A parochial (free section) was added to the north around 1860 and further private sections added to the west (now the centre) and far north. A modern section was added by the Council on former Jeanfield recreation ground to the west, and is known as Jeanfield Cemetery. A wall exists between the two cemeteries but the wall has a gap at each end for mutual access. Modern access is from the south-west on Jeanfield Road. The feature nearest the modern entrance is the monument and attached graves of the 381 Polish pilots who died serving Britain during the Second World War. There are over 90 Commonwealth service personnel and one Belgian soldier buried in the cemetery from the First World War and over 120 Commonwealth personnel from the Second. The cemetery contains a total 573 war graves, maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, of persons who died of wounds, mainly at Perth Royal Infirmary, and other causes. The Polish code-breaker Lieutenant Colonel Gwido Langer was also originally buried here in 1948, as a Polish Signal Corps grave within the Polish war graves, but his body was exhumed in 2010 for reburial in Poland with full military honours. ==Notable interments== *Thomas Morrison Barr (1834-1903) civil engineer *Memorial to Lord Cameron, Neil Cameron, Baron Cameron of Balhousie (1920-1985) commander of the RAF *Jown Dewar (1859-1923) Lord Provost of Perth John DEWAR is buried in ABERDALGIE Churchyard to S of Perth.

It had a wheel arrangement of 1'D1' or 2-8-2 and a single traction motor driving through side rods. ==Overview== Power for the electrification of railway traffic in Hungary could be extracted most economically from the nationwide 50 Hz electricity grid. Therefore, K√°lm√°n Kand√≥ developed his eponymous drive system, which is based on single-phase AC overhead lines and three-phase traction motors. The conversion of the current for the traction motor is provided by a rotary phase converter. The system was demonstrated on a test locomotive from 1923 and, from 1932 to 1935, the route from Budapest to Hegyeshalom was electrified at 16 kV, 50 Hz. The first electric locomotives on the line were of the M√ÅV V40 class. They were mixed-traffic locomotives with a top speed of 100 km/h. A total of 29 locomotives of this class were used on the said route. In the 1960s, the traction current system in Hungary was converted to 25 kV, 50 Hz and the Kand√≥ locomotives were withdrawn. ==Preservation== V40.016 is preserved in the Hungarian Railway History Park, Budapest, after standing for years at Budapest East Railway Station. ==Technical features== The single-phase alternating current taken from the overhead line was converted into three-phase current by the phase converter and supplied to a single traction motor which was a 48-pole asynchronous motor. The phase converter provided four fixed speeds (25,50,75 and 100 km/h) and intermediate speeds were obtained using a liquid rheostat. Final drive was through a Kand√≥ triangle with one arm connected to an auxiliary idling shaft to minimise unwanted vertical forces. The locomotive was built on a rigid frame. Two of the driving axles had side play, which was controlled by Krauss- Helmholtz bogies. ==Other Kand√≥ locomotives== The experimental Kand√≥ locomotive was M√ÅV Class V50, built 1923. Its wheel arrangement was E or 0-10-0. A freight version of the Class V40 was also built. This was the Class V60, built 1932, which had a wheel arrangement of F or 0-12-0. ==References== Category:Electric locomotives of Hungary Category:1‚Ä≤D1‚Ä≤ locomotives Category:Standard gauge locomotives of Hungary ","title":"M√ÅV Class V40"},{"id":"56569414","text":"Elizabeth Stevenson (13 June 1919 ‚Äî 1999) was an American author.

By 1907 more space was needed so premises were rented at Market Place in the centre of Henley-On-Thames, where the company remained for many years. The 2-stroke engine with crankcase compression had been invented by Joseph Day in the mid-1890s. This made possible lightweight engines and new applications. Stuart Turner was exploring making small 2-strokes for motorcycles and generators. In 1911, Stuart Turner developed a complete motorcycle using a Chater-Lea frame and Druid forks. The key part manufactured by Stuart was the 2-port single cylinder 2-stroke engine rated at 2 1/2 HP (71 x 75.5mm bore and stroke giving 299cc).\\"The 2 1/2HP Two-Stroke Stuart\\", The Motor Cycle, 9th Nov 1911, p1173 They exhibited it at the 1911 Olympia show (on the stand of R.G. Nye and Co of London). In 1912 and 1913 they marketed the Stuart Stellar (some early references use 'Stella') motorcycle, this used an in-line two-cylinder water-cooled two-stroke engine complete with shaft drive. Engine capacity is variously quoted as 743 cc and 786 cc. This would be comparable with the Scott motorcycle of the time which had a transverse water cooled two-stroke twin- cylinder engine of 532 cc. However, in-spite of the innovative design, the Stellar was not a success and only 26 examples were built. The firm secured the contract to make engines for the Dayton motorised bicycle made by Charles Day Manufacturing Co in Shoreditch, London, which was until then purely a bicycle manufacturer. This went on sale in late 1913. The engine has a one- piece cylinder and head with a rear-facing spark plug, and was of 162 cc, rated at 1.5 HP. The bore was 57 mm and the stroke 63.5 mm, and it had a U.H. magneto and Amac carburettor. Both single-speed and two-speed versions were available, and prices in July 1914 were 20 to 28 guineas according to specification. Two employees, Alec Plint and W.G. Ayling, rode the Dayton bikes in motorcycle endurance events run by the Auto-Cycle Union (ACU), such as the six days trial. Weighing only 148 lb, these were usually the smallest motorcycles competing. These events included riding between and taking part in various tests, such as hill starts, acceleration and braking, cold starts, and climbing steep rough hills. Total distance for the 1914 event was 674 miles.Motor Cycle Magazine, 2 July 1914 The Daytons did well given that they were considered rather lacking in power as revealed by this excerpt from the Motor Cycle magazine of July 1914 ‚Äì 'Ayling (Dayton) footed vigorously, but got his lilliputian engine to the top'.Motor Cycle Magazine, 16 July 1914 Production of engines for the Dayton was 20 engines per week, but production of the Dayton motorcycle ceased in 1915 due to the first World War.

The inlet non-return valve is the subject of another Stuart Turner patent in 1911, naming Ernest Masters as co-applicant.\\"An Improved Valve for use on Internal Combustion Engines.\\", Patent GB191102214 In 1914, the company manufactured a generating plant for the Antarctic explorer Ernest Shackleton's ship, the Endurance. It was used in the ill-fated Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition. ===During World War I=== During World War I (1914‚Äì18), the company produced nuts and bolts, gas valves and a klaxon horn for gas attack warnings. The workforce expanded to over 300 men and 100 women. In 1917, Stuart Turner acquired Broadgates Inn in Market Place, Henley-on- Thames, and has used this as a base ever since. ===The inter-war years=== Shortly after the war, Stuart Turner introduced the P3 single-cylinder 2-stroke engine, designed by Alec Plint to drive lighting and pumping plants. This engine was to form the basis of a range of engines used for small power applications, particularly as marine engines and to drive generators, though also to drive equipment and pumps. Castings were produced in Stuart Turner's own foundry. The P4 superseded the P3 in 1928, and in 1930 the marine variant was introduced, and was sold in considerable number for fitment in small yachts and other pleasure boats. In around 1935/1936 the P4 was joined by the larger-bore P5 (268 cc) and twin-cylinder P55 (535 cc). While the P4 was made until the war, the P5 and P55 continued in production for over 30 years. For the marine engines, Stuart Turner produced a reversing gearbox and optional final drive reduction gear, and everything else up to and including the propellor was available. The many variations of the engines (marine and otherwise) were indicated by suffixes to the engine number; so, for example, a P55ME would be a marine P55 with electric start (Lucas Dynamotor, Siba Dynastart, or separate dynamo and starter). Between 1932 and 1935, Stuart Turner produced the small (1/2 HP) type N engine, which had an overhung crank. This model seems to have been superseded by the type R 2-stroke engine, which was introduced in 1934 with a full width crank. The R2 being 84 cc, and the R3 having a larger bore size and hence 123 cc. These small engines were used for general utility, but also the R3M for pleasure boats, hire boats. The R3 was to continue in production until 1977. The model engineering range was extensive throughout the inter-war years, with much production sold as kits of castings, though some complete engines were also sold. Most of the models were designed to be representative of a class of engine, mainly steam driven, rather than an accurate scale recreation of a specific engine. Internal combustion engines were also available as kits, including the 'lightweight' 2-stroke petrol engine. From 1935, Stuart Turner was also the United Kingdom agent for the American 'Brown Junior' 10 cc engineThe Model Engineer, Vol 72, No 1763, p181, 1935 for which they developed an aluminium (elektron) airscrew. Some of the engines were intended to do a job of work rather than for the entertainment of a model engineer, for example, the 1935 Sandhurst horizontal 2/3 bhp engine, which was described thus:Bond's Model and Experimental Engineers Handbook, 1935, Jubilee Edition 'This engine will run on gas or petrol and is designed for continuous work such as dynamo, workshop or pump driving. It is supplied only as castings for the amateur to machine up.'. The larger steam engines, for example, the model 6A, are capable of 4 bhp and powering steam launches, thereby blurring the distinction between whether they were model engines, or designed to do a job of work, or both. Many ancillaries were sold to illustrate the power from the model engines, such as the Avery Multipolar dynamo. In the 1906 catalogue, this dynamo (output of 20 volts, 4 amps at 1200 rpm) was said to have been \\"designed for use with a Stuart No2 engine\\". A variety of dynamos were sold over the years allowing them to be matched to the power of the model engine. Stuart Turner also produced a wide range of boilers to power their steam engines, and sold matched boiler and steam engine as complete 'steam plants'. The most common boilers are the small 501 and 504 copper horizontal types used to drive the model steam engines, but they also produced a range of riveted steel vertical boilers up to 20 inches diameter, and 36 inches high, either with a central flue or with multiple tubes. They also offered brazing services for customers' boilers. They also produced two complete model steamboats. The 24-inch Henley was produced from 1925, and had a single-cylinder S.T. oscillating steam engine, and the 39-inch Isis was launched the next year with a model 495 boiler and the twin-cylinder Star steam engine.British Toy Boats, Author Roger Gillham, Veloce Publishing, 2011 These boats were produced until at least 1936, probably until the war disrupted matters. There was a version of the Henley steamboat powered by a Stuart Turner electric motor; this boat was sold as the 'Magician'. The 4-volt electric motor was also sold separately. In 1923 the War Office invited Stuart Turner (and other firms) to design a very light air-cooled engine and generator for wireless. It was to be carried on a pack mule. The whole plant must not weigh more than 84 lb, it had to run in any temperature from freezing to 60 ¬∞C; it must not be affected by being carried upside down or in any position; it must govern within 5% and there were various other conditions. The result was that five firms produced engines but the Stuart Turner engine was the only one which fulfilled the requirements and passed the tests. This was the W.D. engine, which was a 4-stroke side-valve flat twin, and continued in production for 20 years. Two of these engines were taken on the 1933 Everest expedition to power the wireless sets. From 1928 until the war, the company issued nine patents (again naming Alec Plint) for milking machines and developed a diaphragm pulsatory milking machine which was marketed by Gascoine of Reading, who later took over the rights. They also developed pumps, and in the 1933 Bond's catalogueBond's Model and Experimental Engineers Handbook, 1933‚Äì1934, 2nd Edition a complete Stuart Turner electric motor and centrifugal pump on a baseplate with 180, 800, or 1120 gallons per hour was advertised. This evolved into the current product line of centrifugal pumps. In 1932, Stuart Turner produced the model K 4-stroke engine, which was a single- cylinder overhead-valve engine designed to power refrigeration units. Only 64 were made, the last in 1938. In 1934, Stuart Turner introduced the S type steam engine. This was not a model but a fully enclosed single-cylinder commercial power unit of 1 to 1.5 HP designed to drive generators or fans or pumps. It stood 22 inches tall with a 10-inch flywheel and weighed about 120 lb. Preston Services have stated that there were both slide valve and piston valve versions, only 247 were made between 1934 and 1962. In 1938, Stuart Turner developed a single-cylinder 2-stroke diesel with crankcase compression, the model H. At the time this was the smallest commercial diesel engine in the world. Archived from Stuart Marine Engines website. These engines were sold mainly to the RNLI for charging batteries. ===During World War II=== The company produced a number of products for the military during World War II (1939‚Äì45), including combined boiler, steam engine and generator plants, designed to be used by resistance fighters or troops operating covertly behind enemy lines to power radio transmitters. The first of these modest-sized steam generator plants was called the Firefly, and was based around the Stuart Sirius engine, later ones named Mk814 had a bespoke single-cylinder piston valve engine. Stuart Turner also produced many internal combustion generators with uses such as charging aircraft batteries and providing dummy runway lights on fake airfields. Stuart Turner engines were built into the back of AEC fuel bowser trucks to drive a Zwicky Ltd pump to transfer fuel to aircraft. These P5XC engines were referred to in-house as the Zwicky engines. ===After World War II=== Stuart Turner continued to make engines (especially marine engines), pumps, generators, and model kits throughout the post-war years, though several of the pre-war model internal combustion engines did not reappear. Stuart Turner P5-powered 1.5KVA mains generator, c1960 The pre-war single-cylinder diesel engine was joined by a new twin-cylinder 2-stroke diesel in 1953, the H2/H2M/H2MR. Whereas the single had used crankcase compression to scavenge the cylinder, the twin-cylinder had two air pumps. Rated at 9 HP, the capacity was 780 cc, and weight 240 kg. The Single Cylinder Model H was updated to the H1, and many of its detail design features were changed, and ultimately it looked very much like a H2 minus a cylinder. Only 15 H1's were made. The single-cylinder diesel was phased out in 1960 and the twin in 1968, with only about 400 of each model produced. A four-stroke twin- cylinder petrol engine (the 12HP ST4/ST4M/ST4MR/ST4RE) was introduced in May 1968. Rated at 12 HP, it was the most powerful engine in the range. This side- valve engine was 955 cc capacity and weighed 155 kg. Both hand-start and electric-start versions were produced, but production was only about 150 engines, and it was phased out in 1975. In 1969, the P5 and the P55 twin were replaced by the more powerful 5 HP P6 and 10 HP P66 (both at the higher speed of 1650 rpm). There were a number of detailed differences, including a change to the ignition system, but the bore and stroke remained the same. Stuart Turner marketed some small marine diesels from the Spanish marine engine company Sol√© as the Stuart Sol√©. Sol√© converts engines from a wide variety of manufacturers for marine use. From a 1977 Stuart Sol√© operators manual, it is known that Stuart Sol√© engines were available in 6 hp and 9 hp variants, which seem identical in appearance to the Sol√© Mini-1 and Mini-2 engines, based on Lombardini engines and made by Sol√© between 1974 and 1986. These were a common fitment in vessels made by the Cornish Crabbers boat-building company in the late 1970s and probably into the early 1980s, one 1981 example being listed for sale with an 11 hp Stuart Sol√© engine. Stuart Turner ceased their marine engine production in 1978, and the spares and support were transferred to another company. In 1987, Stuart Turner Ltd acquired Morewood Model Engineers and the Stuart Model range moved to Cheddar in Somerset. Still branded as Stuart Models, it was a wholly owned subsidiary of Stuart Turner Ltd. Cheddar Models Ltd was formed as an offshoot from Stuart Models in the late 1980s. In 1991, the brand and range were sold to David Jones of Jones and Bradburn and it moved to Guernsey. When Cheddar Models went bankrupt in 2005 models and plans were absorbed back into the Stuart Model range. At some point, possibly as part of this reorganisation, Stuart Models had acquired the rights to the Plastow Traction Engine model range, which they sold in October 2006 to Bridport foundry of Dorset, who had been responsible for the castings. In July 2012 Stuart Models was bought by Bridport Foundry. Stuart Turner Ltd continued making domestic water pumps staying at Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, England. ==List of Stuart steam models== Stuart Turner No.10 V, built from castings. A typical beginner's project ;No.1 :The original vertical single-cylinder steam engine, bore 2 inches, stroke 2 inches, standing 13 inches high.

The cylinder pivots, thereby alternately uncovering inlet and exhaust ports (see oscillating cylinder steam engine). Bore and stroke inches. ;Twin Oscillator :Twin oscillating cylinders set in a 90-degree V to drive a common crank. Introduced c1930. ;Puffin :Twin oscillating cylinders set in-line. A model sold as a complete steam plant with boiler as part of the Cheddar Models range in the 1990s, and absorbed into the Stuart Models range, where it was made available as a ready-made standalone engine, or a complete plant with boiler. It has -inch bore and stroke. ;Pintail :Twin oscillating cylinders set in-line. Like the Puffin, this was a model sold as a complete steam plant with boiler as part of the Cheddar Models range in the 1990s, and absorbed into the Stuart Models range where it was made available as a ready- made standalone engine. It has -inch bore and -inch stroke. ;Progress :This was actually a range of engine kits designed for the owner of only a small lathe, with the cylinder already bored and faced. These were produced in the 1920s and 1930s. There was the vertical oscillating (OV), horizontal oscillating (OH), the vertical slide valve (SV) the horizontal slide valve (SH), and the horizontal mill (HM). The horizontal oscillating engine has been recently re-introduced by Stuart Models. ;Meteor :A small vertical single- cylinder marine engine designed for 30-inch boats. -inch bore and stroke, table-style engine supported on 4 columns with trunk crosshead guide and piston valve. Listed through 1930s. ;Simplex :A small vertical single-cylinder engine made in the 1920s, maybe a precursor to the Meteor, with slide valve. Bore and stroke 0.625 inches. ;BB :5-inch-tall enclosed vertical steam engine with single-sided ball bearing crankshaft and aluminium crankcase available in 1930s for model boats, e.g. hydroplanes. Bore 0.75 inches, stroke 0.625 inches. ;Twin Launch :Twin-cylinder vertical launch engine, bore 1 inch, stroke 0.875 inches. The cylinders are supported on 5 steel columns, and there is single-sided crosshead support. ;Compound Launch :Twin-cylinder vertical launch engine but with compound cylinders, bore 0.75 inches and 1.25 inches, stroke 0.875 inches. ;Triple Expansion :As in best marine practice, three vertical cylinders 0.75 inches, 1.25 inches, 1.75 inches, all 1-inch stroke. ; MTB engines :These were a range of twin-cylinder enclosed engines first introduced in 1906‚Äì1909 and resembling the Westinghouse full scale engines (link to sectioned view). The design was aimed at small high speed boat models, of which the motor torpedo boat was in vogue. Ray Nightingale produced a review of the history of these engines. ;No.1 MTB :0.75-inch bore and stroke, with cam driven slide valve gear. Available as a complete engine or a set of castings. Weight 2 lb. ;No.1a MTB :0.6875-inch bore and 0.625-inch stroke but all aluminium body with brass cylinder liners. Slide valve driven by bevel gear and scotch crank. Available into the 1920s either as a complete engine or a set of castings. Weight 14.5 oz. ;No.1b MTB (180) :As the No1 engine but with bevel gear and scotch crank to drive the slide valve. Many have casting number '180' visible. Introduced between 1910 and 1923. ;No.2 MTB :As No1 engine but with two geared together contra-rotatory crankshafts. Slide-valve. Ideal for driving twin prop model boats with no torque reaction. Dropped sometime prior to 1924. ;No.3 MTB (255) :A larger version of the engine, with 1.25-inch bore and 1-inch stroke. The bevel drive valve gear is enclosed. Casting number 255 on the crankcase. These appeared in about 1924 and were available for 10 years. They were also sold as stationary engines and would drive 120 to 150W output. ;Star :The aluminium bodied Star was introduced in 1926 (as was the Isis steam launch she powered). Although similar in design it was a completely new engine and was only available as a finished item. It had 0.625-inch bore and stroke. It used the bevel drive, but this time enclosed within the crankcase. For the valve gear, it used a banjo drive to a close fitting piston valve, this having significant advantages for 'flash' steam plant which could be very high pressure. This engine was produced until the 2nd World War. ;Sun :The Sun was launched in 1927 as a direct replacement for the 1b MTB engine. Like the Star, the bevel drive was moved inside the crankcase, and banjo drive was used with a choice of either piston valve or slide valve. Bore and stroke were 0.75 inches. While the slide valve variant was only available as a kit, the piston valve version was available as a complete engine or kit. The Sun continued after the war as a piston valve kit only and last appeared in the Stuart Turner catalogue in 1989/1990. ;Sirius :The Sirius was introduced in 1938 as a more powerful version of the Star, with 1-inch bore and stroke. The Sirius was to be the driving force in the Firefly generator set during the war, and is still available (2014). At over 6.5 lb, it was three times heavier than the No1 MTB from which it was descended. It is rated at 1/3 hp at 2800 rpm and 80 psi. ;Steam Hammer :This is 1-inch bore and 2-inch stroke, and is a scale model of Rigby's Patent steam hammer made with the co-operation of its manufacturer at the time, R.G. Ross & Son Ltd. It stand 10.5 inches tall, and weighs 9 lb. ;Steam Boiler Feed Pump :This is 0.5-inch bore by 0.75-inch stroke, with a 0.25-inch bore single-acting pump. A tappet on the pump rod actuates a small pilot piston valve which in turn controls the main steam-operated shuttle piston valve. ;H.U. Horizontal Undertype :This combined horizontal boiler with engine below dates back to a design for a compound undertype engine by Henry Greenly in c. 1901.Model Engineer & Electrician, Vol VIII, No 88 It is in the Stuart catalogue for 1928, but was dropped by 1940. After a redesign by H.A. Taylor, a larger version of the undertype was re-released onto the market by Stuart Turner in 1973. This later model had an aluminium baseplate 25 inches long, whereas the original model had a smaller cast-iron baseplate. ==Gas/petrol engine kits== Stuart Turner Type 600 engine running on gas ;400 :A horizontal single-cylinder open-crank gas engine dating back to the 1920s with hot tube or spark ignition, 1.6875-inch bore and 3-inch stroke. The crankshaft was overhung, i.e. single main bearing. ;600 :A substantial horizontal single-cylinder open-crank gas (0.75 HP) or petrol (1.0 HP) engine. 2.5-inch bore, 4.5-inch stroke. From ST's 1930 catalogue \\"Its very efficient governor renders it particularly adaptable for lathe driving, and other variable loads\\". ;800 :A smaller horizontal single-cylinder open-crank gas (0.25 HP) or petrol (0.5 HP) engine based on the 600, but better suited to being made with a small lathe. 1.5-inch bore, 2.75-inch stroke. ;Sandhurst :A horizontal single-cylinder open-crank gas (0.66 HP at 900 rpm) or petrol engine. 2-inch bore, 3-inch stroke, 150 cc, c. 1935, but also listed in the 1969 Stuart catalogue. ;AE :A 60 cc four-stroke flat twin supplied only as castings, air or water cooled. Could also be supplied as a single-cylinder model, which was a useful capacity for 30 cc tethered boat and hydroplane class. 34.5 mm bore, 32 mm stroke. Made from around 1910‚Äì1912, these early versions had an automatic inlet valve. ;New AE :A 60 cc four-stroke flat twin supplied only as castings, air- or water-cooled. The 'new' version was introduced in c. 1930 and produced until the war. It had both crankshaft and camshaft running in ball bearings, duralumin connecting rods, aluminium piston, and valves all mechanically operated. There was also a single-cylinder version. The twin produced 3/4 bhp at 3000 rpm, and 1.3 bhp at 4200 rpm, weight 7.5 lb including the flywheel. The single weighed 4.25 lb and produced 0.6 bhp at 4500 rpm. In the 1938/1939 Stuart Turner catalogue the air-cooled version of the twin-cylinder engine was also available with 1.5-inch bore and 1.75-inch stroke, giving 74 cc. The advertising suggests the main market for these engines was 'record breaking model boats and hydroplanes', and the single's 30 cc capacity was stated in 1931 to 'conform(s) to the rules of International Power Boat racing'. ;Lightweight :With the same bore and stroke as the AE, the lightweight single-cylinder 2-stroke is 29 cc, 1/8 bhp, revs to 3500 rpm, and weighs 3 lb 12 oz, 5 lb 12 oz with flywheel. Like many Stuart Turner engines the Lightweight had iron pistons. It was water-cooled, and was available either as a finished engine or as a set of castings. Advertised in the 1931 catalogue as 'completely redesigned' making it 'easier to machine and lighter', it was probably introduced in the late 1920s, and was for sale through the 1930s, advertised sitting in the palm of your hand. It also appeared in the 1969 catalogue as a kit either water or air cooled, this time with an aluminium piston. An Amal carburettor was available as an optional extra. ;W2 :Three 147 cc engines were listed as new in the 1931 Stuart Turner catalogue all rated at HP at 1000 rpm. With 53 mm bore and stroke the W2 was a 2-stroke, and water cooled. The engine featured a cast iron piston and steel H section connecting rod. The steel crankshaft could be supported in either plain or ball bearings. The kit did not include a carburettor, stating that 'any good carburetor of the correct size may be used', though a range of extras listed included a Villiers carburetor. Likewise, the magneto was not included, stating that 'any standard single-cylinder magneto of 35 mm centre- height may be used', though an English magneto of unspecified make was listed among the extras available. ;A2 :The air-cooled version of the W2, identical in every other respect. In this kit only the cylinder was provided ready machined and ground. In the other kits this could be requested as an option. ;W4 :A water cooled 4-stroke overhead valve version of the W2. Separate inlet and exhaust camshafts ran in bronze bearings. The gear wheels to drive them were supplied ready-made. The four-stroke crankshaft could only use ball bearings. ==Other casting kits== ;Compressor :A compact twin-cylinder air compressor, 2200 cu in air per minute at 1400 rpm. ;Oil Field Pump :Known colloquially as the Nodding Donkey, this class of pump is used in onshore oil fields around the world. Height 12 inches. ;Manual Boiler Feed Pump :Hand cranked, -inch bore, -inch stroke, 4.5 inches long. ;Pillar Drill :9-inch-high miniature pillar drill for the model workshop. ;Lathe :8.5-inch-long miniature lathe for the model workshop. ;Shaper :6.5-inch-high miniature shaper for the model workshop. ==See also== * Stuart Turner (engineer) * Whitney (City Road, London) which made lighting plant, generators, small steam models and centrifugal pumps ==References== ==External links== * Stuart Turner website * Stuart Models website * Summary of many Stuart models * Stuart engine design and analysis website for fans Category:1906 establishments in England Category:British companies established in 1906 Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1906 Category:Technology companies established in 1906 Category:Engineering companies of England Category:Pump manufacturers Category:Companies based in Oxfordshire Category:Henley-on-Thames ","title":"Stuart Turner (company)"},{"id":"56569497","text":"Irina Donets (born 20 August 1976) is a volleyball player from the Netherlands. == Career == She was a member of the Dutch National Women's Team.

The second named storm and first major tropical cyclone of the 2017‚Äì18 South Pacific cyclone season, Gita originated from a monsoon trough that was active in the South Pacific in early February 2018. First classified as a tropical disturbance on 3 February, the nascent system meandered near Vanuatu for several days with little development. After acquiring a steady east trajectory near Fiji, it organized into a Category 1 tropical cyclone on 9 February near Samoa. Arcing south in a clockwise turn, the system rapidly intensified, and became a severe tropical cyclone on 10 February near Niue. Throughout its path in the South Pacific, Cyclone Gita affected multiple island nations and territories. Tonga was the hardest-hit, with severe damage occurring on the islands of Tongatapu and  ªEua; two fatalities and forty-one injuries occurred in the kingdom. At least 171 homes were destroyed and more than 1,100 suffered damage. Violent winds destroyed homes and left the two islands largely without power. Torrential rains and damaging winds caused widespread disruptions in Samoa and American Samoa, prompting emergency declarations in both. Outlying islands in the Fijian Lau Islands were significantly affected, particularly Ono-i-Lau and Vatoa. Wallis and Futuna, Niue, and Vanuatu were also affected, but impacts in those areas were minor. Total damages from Gita are estimated at approximately US$250 million. ==Meteorological history== On 3 February, the Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS) started to monitor Tropical Disturbance 07F, which had developed within a trough of low pressure, about to the southeast of Honiara in the Solomon Islands. The system was poorly organized and was located along an upper-level ridge of high pressure, in an area of high vertical wind shear. Over the next couple of days, the system moved erratically near northern Vanuatu and remained poorly organized, with atmospheric convection located to the south of the low-level circulation center. The system subsequently started to move south-eastwards, towards the Fijian Islands and a favorable environment for further development, on 5 February. The system subsequently passed near the island nation during 8 February, where it developed into a tropical depression and started to move north-eastwards towards the Samoan Islands. During 9 February, the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) initiated advisories on the system and designated it as Tropical Cyclone 09P, after an ASCAT image showed that it had winds of in its northern semicircle. The FMS subsequently named the system Tropical Cyclone Gita early, after the United States National Weather Service Weather Forecast Office in Pago Pago requested that the system be named early for warning and humanitarian reasons. After Gita was named, a prolonged period of rapid intensification ensued as it quickly intensified into a Category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale, before it passed within of Samoa and American Samoa. After moving past the Samoan Islands, Gita turned southeast, then southwards, under the influence of a near-equatorial ridge to the northeast. On 10 February, Gita rapidly intensified to a category 3 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian scale while traversing anomalously warm sea surface temperatures of between . On 11 February, Gita continued to intensify into a category 4 severe tropical cyclone. At the same time, Gita turned westward under the influence of a subtropical ridge to the south. At approximately 10:00 UTC (23:00 TOT) on 11 February, the cyclone passed about south of Tongatapu near its peak intensity, as a powerful Category 5 cyclone on the Australian Scale; the RSMC Nadi-based Australian scale and the JTWC- used Saffir‚ÄìSimpson scale, with maximum 10-minute sustained winds of 205 km/h (125 mph). At the same time, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center estimated peak 1-minute sustained winds at 230 km/h (145 mph). This made Gita the strongest cyclone to strike Tonga in its recorded history. ==Preparations and impact== Gita impacted the Pacific island nations of Vanuatu, Fiji, Wallis and Futuna, Samoa, American Samoa, Niue and Tonga, with the most significant damage being reported in the Samoan Islands and Tonga. As Gita's precursor tropical disturbance impacted Vanuatu's Torba province during 6 February, the Vanuatu Meteorology and Geohazards Department warned that heavy rainfall, thunder and lightning would impact the area and advised people to take extra precautions. Between 8 and 9 February, the system brought strong winds and heavy rain to Wallis and Futuna. Some power outages were reported on Wallis, though overall effects were negligible. During the cyclone's westward turn, it brought significant winds to Niue; however, no damage occurred. ===Samoa=== Global Precipitation Measurement satellite image of Gita near the Samoan islands on 9 February. Heavy rain bands with rainfall rates of per hour were identified near the islands. Gita brought torrential rain to parts of Samoa on 8‚Äì9 February. Hardest hit were areas in and around Apia where more than of rain fell during the overnight hours. Multiple rivers in the city burst their banks and inundated homes. At least 233 people sought refuge in emergency shelters. Landslides and flooding rendered many roads impassable. Communications were briefly lost with the southern coast of Upolu. A state of disaster was declared for the nation on 10 February. Damage to the power grid reached $10 million. ===American Samoa=== In the two days preceding Gita's arrival, an associated monsoon trough produced significant rains, reaching across parts of American Samoa. Multiple streams flooded and prompted evacuations in Malaeloa village. Landslides were reported in Avau, Amanave, and Poloa. Cyclone Gita reached American Samoa on 9 February, bringing heavy rains and strong winds; homes were heavily damaged in the villages of Nu'uuli, Tafuna, and throughout the rest of Tutuila. High winds tore roofs of structures and downed trees and power lines. Approximately 90 percent of Tutuila was left without power and water. The local National Weather Service office in Pago Pago lost power; the Honolulu, Hawaii, office issued forecasts in the interim. Rainfall in Pago Pago exceeded . More than 800 people were displaced from their homes across the territory. Pago Pago International Airport suspended operations for the duration of the storm. Inrastructural damage across the territory was about US$7 million, with an insurance loss of US$18.6 million. A Coast Guard AC-130 conducted aerial surveys of the territory and a small group of Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) personnel were deployed. United States President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency for American Samoa on 11 February. Health officials advised residents to boil water amid an enhanced risk of dengue fever. ===Tonga=== Enhanced infrared satellite image of Gita off the coast of Tonga on 12 February Prior to and during the cyclone, approximately 5,700 residents sought refuge in public shelters. Power was turned off prior to the storm's arrival. Striking Tonga on 12 February, Cyclone Gita brought destructive winds to the capital island of Tongatapu. Initial surveys across the island revealed 119 homes destroyed and another 1,131 damaged, primarily in Nuku ªalofa. Many areas were left without water and power. Many structures lost their roof during the height of the storm. Older structures suffered the greatest damage, including the Tongan Parliament building, built more than 100 years ago, which was flattened by the storm. Fua ªamotu International Airport sustained damage, along with the domestic terminal, prompting officials to keep the airport closed. Across Tongatapu, 3 people suffered major injuries while another 30 experienced minor injuries. An elderly woman died while trying to find shelter after her home was destroyed. One person died from a heart attack potentially related to the storm in Fua ªamotu. On the neighboring island of  ªEua, the storm knocked out power to all residents and caused extensive damage. Similar to Tongatapu, older structures suffered severe damage while newer buildings fared well. Crops were largely destroyed. Fifty-two homes were completely destroyed on the island; eight people suffered injury, including one severe. Total damage were estimated at T$356.1 million (US$164.1 million), including a NZ$20 million (US$14.5 million) damage to the power grid. Immediately following the storm, a curfew was imposed for all of Tonga. Personnel from His Majesty's Armed Forces rescued people during the storm and began clearing roads at daybreak on 13 February. National Emergency Management Office spokesman Graham Kenna called the storm \\"the worst situation [he has] been in\\" during his 30-year career. MP Lord Fusitu ªa described the impact as the worst since at least Cyclone Isaac in 1982. India provided US$500,000 humanitarian aid to Tonga under UNOSSF. On 13 February, Australia provided A$350,000 (US$275,000) in emergency supplies via the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) to assist more than 2,000 people. Australia also sent humanitarian supplies to the Tongan Red Cross. Two civilian humanitarian specialists were deployed to assist Tonga's National Emergency Management Office. A medical expert also provided assistance to assess health infrastructure. New Zealand provided NZ$750,000 (US$544,000) in assistance. ===Fiji=== On 13 February, the center of Gita passed roughly south of Ono-i-Lau in the Lau Islands of Fiji. Observations from the island revealed peak sustained winds of with gusts to . Flooding from tidal surge preceded the core of the cyclone by several hours. Structural damage was reported in Doi Village, including one home that lost its roof. Communications with Ono-i-Lai and nearby Vatoa were disrupted for roughly a day. Across both islands, 10 homes were destroyed and 26 more sustained damage. Many structures sustained roof damage and crops were devastated. Local leaders on Ono-i-Lau called the storm the \\"worst in living memory\\". Damage to the nation were at FJ$1.23 million (US$606,000). ===New Caledonia=== In advance of the storm, most tourists visiting the Isle of Pines, southeast Grande Terre, were evacuated to Noum√©a; however, many stayed to ride out the storm. Municipal buildings were opened to the public as shelters. All businesses suspended operations on 16 February. ===New Zealand=== As Cyclone Gita threatened to hit New Zealand as a strong ex-tropical cyclone, New Zealand's MetService issued heavy rain warnings and strong wind warnings covering a wide expanse of the country. Campers, hikers, and boaters in the Marlborough Sounds were told to evacuate, and residents there were warned that communications could be cut off by the storm. Several schools in the region of Nelson were closed, while in the West Coast, schools in the districts of Buller and Grey were closed. Air New Zealand cancelled a number of flights on 20 February. As Gita bore down on the South Island, bringing floods and strong winds, a state of emergency was eventually declared on 20 February. Insurance loss across the territory were at least NZ$28 million (US$20.6 million). ==See also== *Cyclone Ofa *Cyclone Hina *Cyclone Waka *Cyclone Heta *Cyclone Ian *Cyclone Winston ==References== ==External links== Category:2017‚Äì18 South Pacific cyclone season Category:Category 5 South Pacific cyclones Category:February 2018 events in Oceania Category:Tropical cyclones in American Samoa Category:Tropical cyclones in Samoa Category:Tropical cyclones in Tonga Category:Tropical cyclones in Vanuatu Category:Tropical cyclones in Fiji Category:Tropical cyclones in Niue Category:Tropical cyclones in Wallis and Futuna Category:2018 in American Samoa Category:2018 in Samoa Category:2018 in Niue Category:2018 in Tonga Category:2018 in Vanuatu Category:2018 in Fiji Category:2018 in Wallis and Futuna Category:2018 in New Zealand Category:Tropical cyclones in New Caledonia Category:2018 in New Caledonia Category:Tropical cyclones in New Zealand Gita ","title":"Cyclone Gita"},{"id":"56569635","text":"The Wied Scala The Wied-Scala is an art-house cinema in Neitersen in the Westerwald region of Germany.

Fonseca (1915‚Äì2005) was a Massachusetts state senator who represented the Second Bristol District from 1953 to 1984. As Assistant Majority Leader, she was the first woman to hold a leadership post in the Massachusetts Senate. Fonseca was known as a strong supporter of working women and public education. In her first senate speech, she successfully argued for an end to discrimination against women teachers in Massachusetts public schools. ==Early life== She was born in Fall River, Massachusetts, the daughter of Mary Botelho and Jos√© Leite, both Portuguese immigrants. Her father owned a small grocery store on the corner of Webster and Alden Streets. After graduating from Durfee High School in 1932, she wanted to go to college but, as she explained in an interview, \\"as the oldest girl in a family of 12, I had to go right to work.\\" She worked at the Fall River Public Library, and later as a secretary for the U.S. Census Bureau. ==Political career== She first became interested in politics as a teenager, when she accompanied her mother to meetings of the Portuguese-American Civic League. Soon she began taking part in the League's fundraising drives, and organized a Junior Council for young members. She was elected to the Fall River School Committee in 1945 and served two four-year terms. During her last year on the committee she served as vice chairman. Concerned about rising unemployment in her area, she successfully ran for state senate in 1952, running a low-budget campaign out of her family's modest third-floor apartment. She was the first woman to represent the Second Bristol District in the senate, the first Portuguese-American woman elected to the Massachusetts Senate, and possibly the first Portuguese-American woman to be elected to any legislative seat in the United States. As Assistant Majority Leader (or Majority Whip) from 1973 to 1984, she was also the first woman to hold a leadership post in the Massachusetts senate. Fonseca earned a reputation as a champion of women and public education. In her \\"maiden speech\\" on the senate floor, she argued in support of a bill ending discrimination against married women teachers: > There are only two bachelors and three women in the Massachusetts State > Senate. That means out of 40 senators, 35 of you are going to have to make a > determination before we leave here today as to whether or not your wives > became less competent the day they married you. When a male teacher gets > married, his pay is not lowered, nor are his annual leave and pension rights > taken from him, yet there is a double standard where women are concerned. > Why? After having been voted down repeatedly for years, the bill finally passed. Fonseca went on to chair the Senate Committee on Education, and was a strong supporter of Southeastern Massachusetts University (now the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth) and Bristol Community College in Fall River. In 1974 she successfully argued in favor of tax deductions for working mothers' daycare expenses. ==Personal life== She married John C. Fonseca Jr., an insurance company employee, in 1948. The couple had two children, John and Irene. Her husband died in 1970. She was active in many civic and charitable organizations, including the Business and Professional Women's Foundation, the National Order of Women Legislators, the Portuguese-American Civic League, the Salvation Army Women's Auxiliary, and the Holy Name Women. Towards the end of her life Fonseca suffered from Alzheimer's disease. She died of a heart attack in the County Gardens Nursing Home in Swansea, Massachusetts. Mary L.

The film stars Kevin Costner and Woody Harrelson as Frank Hamer and Maney Gault, two former Texas Rangers who attempt to track down and apprehend notorious criminals Bonnie and Clyde in the 1930s. Kathy Bates, John Carroll Lynch, Kim Dickens, Thomas Mann and William Sadler also star. The film had been in development hell for many years, with producer Casey Silver looking into the project as early as 2005. Originally pitched by Fusco as a possible Paul Newman and Robert Redford project, the film began development at Universal Pictures but never came to fruition. In February 2018, it was reported Netflix had picked up the rights to the film and that Costner and Harrelson would star. Filming took place later that month and in March, shooting around Louisiana and at several historical sites, including the road where Bonnie and Clyde were killed. The Highwaymen had a limited theatrical release in the United States on March 15, 2019 before being released digitally on March 29, 2019 on Netflix. ==Plot== In 1934, after two years on the run, criminals Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow break several associates out of Texas' Eastham Prison Farm. Texas Department of Corrections Chief Lee Simmons persuades Governor \\"Ma\\" Ferguson to hire former Texas Ranger Frank Hamer to track down the criminals. Reluctant to leave retirement and his wife Gladys, Hamer joins the manhunt after the fugitive gang is involved in a devastating shootout in Missouri, and he recruits his former partner, Benjamin Maney Gault. Information from FBI wiretapping of the fugitives' families leads Hamer and Gault to conclude that Bonnie and Clyde are returning \\"home\\" to Dallas. Watching Bonnie's mother's house, they see a man throw a bottle into her yard, which is soon thrown back, but a boy escapes with it. Dismissing the Rangers' theory, the FBI believe the fugitives are in Brownsville. Hamer and Gault meet with Dallas Sheriff \\"Smoot\\" Schmid, who introduces them to Deputy Sheriff Ted Hinton, a childhood friend of Bonnie and Clyde who can identify them on sight. The gang kills two policemen in nearby Grapevine; Hamer and Gault investigate the scene and determine that Bonnie has a rabbit, which Hinton suggests is a present for a family member. The Rangers drive to Oklahoma and question a gas station attendant, who declares his support for the criminals. Hamer assaults the man into admitting the gang passed through en route to a migrant camp, where a local girl confirms the gang stayed. A radio bulletin alerts the Rangers to two more murdered officers but, being outside their jurisdiction, they are barred from passing the police roadblock, which a frustrated Hamer drives around. They continue to Coffeyville, Kansas, correctly guessing that Bonnie and Clyde will stop there for supplies. As the Rangers move in on the fugitives, an adoring crowd surrounds the criminals' car. Hamer and Gault give chase, but Bonnie and Clyde escape through a dirt field. Learning that Clyde had breakfast in Amarillo, the Rangers return to Dallas to find the rabbit has been delivered to Bonnie's family. Hamer meets Henry Barrow, Clyde's father, who affirms that his son must be stopped. The Rangers have Simmons furlough Wade McNabb, an incarcerated associate of the gang, hoping to draw them out. While Hamer interrogates McNabb at a bar, Gault is threatened in the restroom by thugs sympathetic to the gang, but subdues them. Learning that Bonnie plans to meet a hairdresser the next day, the Rangers surveil her mother's house again. A man throws another bottle into the yard, which is retrieved by the same boy but intercepted by the Rangers; it contains a message that the gang are heading elsewhere. Realizing McNabb warned the gang, the Rangers visit his home and discover him beaten to death. Simmons recalls Hamer and Gault to Austin, but they return to their theory that \\"outlaws always go home\\", predicting that the fugitives are going to Bienville Parish, Louisiana, home of gang member Henry Methvin's father, Ivy. Searching Ivy's house, the Rangers find evidence of the outlaws' recent stay. They join forces with local Sheriff Henderson Jordan and Deputy Prentiss Oakley to confront Ivy; in exchange for his son's safety, he reveals that the gang will soon return. The lawmen are joined by Hinton and Dallas Sheriff's Deputy Bob Alcorn, and Gault tells them of his first deployment with Hamer: they killed a gang of bandits, including a fleeing 13-year-old boy. Ivy informs them the gang is arriving the next day, and the posse prepare an ambush on the road to his house, staging his truck as if it has broken down. Bonnie and Clyde arrive, stopping to assist Ivy, and Hamer orders them to raise their hands. Instead, the criminals prepare to draw their own weapons, and are gunned down. The bullet-riddled car with Bonnie and Clyde's bodies is towed to Arcadia, Louisiana and mobbed by onlookers. Refusing $1,000 for an interview with the Associated Press, Hamer and Gault drive home. ==Cast== * Kevin Costner as Frank Hamer * Woody Harrelson as Maney Gault * Kathy Bates as Miriam \\"Ma\\" Ferguson * John Carroll Lynch as Lee Simmons * Thomas Mann as Deputy Ted Hinton * Dean Denton as Deputy Bob Alcorn * Kim Dickens as Gladys Hamer * William Sadler as Henry Barrow * W.

The project had been a long-time goal of Fusco's to portray Texas Ranger Frank Hamer in the proper light of history. Fusco researched extensively in Texas and became friends with Hamer's son, the late Frank Hamer Jr. By 2013, the project was under development at Universal Pictures. On June 21, 2017, it was reported that Netflix was in negotiations to extricate the production from Universal Pictures. At the time of the report, Netflix was in early discussions with Woody Harrelson and Kevin Costner for the two lead roles and with John Lee Hancock as director. The script was written by John Fusco. Casey Silver, who had been developing the project while it was at Universal, was set to produce. On February 12, 2018, it was announced by Netflix that the film had entered production. Hancock was officially confirmed as director, and Harrelson, Costner, and Silver were confirmed as producers. They are set to produce alongside Michael Malone and Rod Lake. ===Casting=== Alongside the announcement of the film entering production, it was confirmed that Costner and Harrelson would be playing Frank Hamer and Maney Gault, respectively. In addition, it was announced that Kathy Bates, John Carroll Lynch, Kim Dickens, Thomas Mann, and William Sadler had also joined the cast. ===Filming=== Principal photography for the film commenced on February 12, 2018, in New Orleans, Louisiana and was expected to last until April 10, 2018. The production was set to film in other locations around the state including Covington, LaPlace, Hammond, Baton Rouge, and Garyville. On February 21, 2018, filming took place at Laurel Valley Plantation in Vacherie, Louisiana. The production moved to Donaldsonville, Louisiana where filming took place through February 26, 2018 and where it reportedly shut down an area of the town‚Äôs historic district. On March 5, 2018, filming occurred at the Old Louisiana Governor's Mansion in Baton Rouge. Production reportedly caused streets surrounding it to be blocked off for the majority of the day. From March 21 to 25, 2018, filming took place on Highway 154. Reportedly, the production was reenacting the killing of Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow near where the actual event took place. To recreate the scene on what is now an asphalt two-lane highway, the film crew planted trees along the right-of-way and added dirt to cover the blacktop road. Later that month, filming took place on an old U.S. Route 380 bridge that sits southwest of Newcastle, Texas crossing the Brazos River; this bridge was a stand-in for the old Young County Bridge on the Red River between Texas and Oklahoma which had been closed down decades earlier. Principal photography for the film concluded on March 29, 2018 in Shreveport, Louisiana. The production reportedly had a budget of $49 million. ==Release== The film premiered at the Paramount Theatre in Austin, Texas on March 10, 2019 during the South by Southwest film festival, as part of the \\"Headliners\\" series of screenings. It then began a limited theatrical release on March 15, 2019 before beginning to stream digitally on March 29, 2019 on Netflix. In April 2019, Netflix reported that 40 million households had watched the film during its first month of release. ==Reception== On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 57% based on 135 reviews, with an average rating of 5.94/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"The Highwaymen depicts law enforcement's side of the Bonnie and Clyde manhunt -- a story that's unfortunately not quite as entertaining despite its marquee leads.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 58 out of 100, based on 28 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\".

The series was produced by Eko with Sam Barlow as creative lead. The production was released in six episodes starting on March 14, 2018 through Eko's website, mobile app, Nerdist.com, Steam and Vudu. Narratively, the show follows a young group of people that are involved in the hacker culture, attempting to use their skills to create societal change. Interactively, the viewer is presented with several video feeds, representing what each of the characters is watching or doing, and can choose which one to focus on; this will affect how the work is presented to the viewer later, though will otherwise not change the narrative. ==Development== MGM's 1983 film WarGames was both a critical and financial success for the distributor. While the studio attempted a sequel, WarGames: The Dead Code in 2008, the work ended up going direct-to-video. In June 2011, MGM announced plans to remake WarGames. At the time, this move was seen as a way by MGM to capitalize on its highly- successful library of films from the 1980s. Seth Gordon was originally slated to direct with Noah Oppenheim to write the script. In June 2014, Dean Israelite had been hired to produce the work, and with potentially Arash Amel slated to write the screenplay. As late as February 2015, Israelite was still working on the project which was still in its scripting phase, but by April 2015, Israelite had been picked up for producer of Power Rangers, lead to concern for his participation for WarGames. By October 2015, the project had shifted to become an interactive media work, co-produced by MGM and Interlude (the former name of Eko), with plans to release by early 2016. The move was seen as experimental by MGM, as the work would forgo any theatrical release or revenues, though could still be monetized depending on how the interactive work was presented to viewers. They saw an \\"audience-driven interactive story experience\\" as a perfect fit for the WarGames property. Shortly after this announcement, MGM invested heavily into Interlude, which had raised from investors including MGM, Warner Music Group, Samsung, Sequoia Capital and Intel Capital. Around March 2016, Interlude hired Sam Barlow as executive creative director and creative lead for the WarGames project. Barlow had gained attention in 2015 for his video game Her Story, which required players to piece together a narrative by assembling segments of video footage in the right order. Her Story received critical acclaim on its release. Barlow said of the opportunity with Interlude to work alongside people that wanted to make \\"personalized, reactive stories with a heightened emotional impact\\". By December 2017, MGM announced that the interactive media series would be called \\"#WarGames\\" with an anticipated start in early 2018. By February, Eko confirmed that the series would be six episodes long, and would be broadcast with interactivity on its own website, mobile app, Nerdist.com, Steam and on Vudu. ===Story=== According to Barlow, their original idea for the narrative was to be similar to the film, in which hackers would stumble upon something that appeared to be a game, but proved to have more a more \\"nefarious purpose\\". However, they recognized there would be too much jarring between the live-action and in-game segments, and instead took a different route, by envisioning how a member of the hacker culture would interact. The viewer of the work would be put in place of a hacker, looking at the hacker's computer monitor, showing various streams from cameras, video calls, and other audiovisual elements that they could bring anyone to the forefront at any time. Rather than having the viewer make any explicit decision, the work would instead track what video element had the user's attention, and decide which way the story would go from there. Barlow likened this to trying to listen into conversations at a party: one can hear the conversations as they go on, but to really understand them one must focus on a specific conversation. With further development of the story, Barlow created a narrative around the character of Kelly, played by Jess Nurse, who is meant to represent \\"the breadth of modern hacker culture and its humanity\\". Barlow was able to \\"take the questions raised by the original movie and ask them again in a world where technology has fundamentally changed our lives\\" with his script. During development, the show Mr. Robot came out, which also focused on the hacker culture, leading Barlow to make sure that they presented accurate scenarios related to hacking within #WarGames; they hired security consultants to make sure their hacking scenarios were potentially doable. Further, to distinguish themselves from the more serious tone taken by Mr. Robot, Barlow aimed his script to be light-hearted and with an optimistic outlook. ==References== Category:Interactive media ","title":"WarGames (interactive media)"},{"id":"56569881","text":"Sir Charles Kent (1743? ‚Äì 14 March 1811) was a British landowner and MP.

The huts are missing and presumed demolished. ==History== These Quonset hits were manufactured by the Butler Manufacturing Company and shipped to Lansing in 1941. They were set up at this location in November, 1941 to house the newly established 9622nd USAF Reserve Recovery Unit. Soon after, the Civil Air Patrol was established, and the Lansing unit began using the huts. For the remainder of World War II, the Lansing Quonset huts were used as a pilot training facility for both the Civil Air Patrol and the USAF Reserve Recovery Unit. The three huts were used continually after the war until 1958, when they were dismantled and put into storage in response to a perceived military threat to the airport. However, the huts were put back into service in 1963, and were used until at least the early 1990s, despite planned demolition in the 1980s. However, by 1995, the huts were deemed as airport hazards by the Federal Aviation Administration and vacated. Demolition was scheduled at that time. ==Description== The three Quonset huts sat side by side. All three were constructed from prefabricated corrugated steel panels placed horizontally over arched steel ribs and purloins.

A fracture occurs when a tooth contacts a hard object with enough force to break a section of enamel. Chips form with minimal plastic deformation since enamel is strong but brittle. A fracture typically occurs as an irregular break on the occlusal edge of the enamel, and is therefore different to other forms of tooth wear that leave smooth surfaces. Pulp sensibility testing is recommended to confirm pulpal health. Treatment depends on the size of the fractures. If a tooth fragment is still available, it can be bonded to the tooth. For small or minor fractures, it can be smoothed to remove rough margins and edges. For a larger or major fractures, dental composite resin can be used to mask the defective enamel for aesthetic purpose.

It survives the dry southern summer through storage of its resources in a corm. The stem carries two or three erect, sticky leaves of up to 18 cm (7 in) long, H-shaped in cross-section. This species blooms with six to twelve bilaterally symmetrical flowers, in a spike. Sometimes the spike has one side branch with fewer flowers. Each flower has six pale beige perianth lobes, a purple-red ring around a purple red tube and three blackish stamens. Each flower is subtended by two 1¬º‚Äì2¬º cm (¬Ω‚Äì‚Öû in) long green bracts. This species was found flowering from the end of September till mid October. It is an endemic of the western slopes of the Piketberg mountains in the Western Cape province of South Africa. == Taxonomy == The species was described in a publication in 2013 by South African botanists Peter Goldblatt and John Manning. It belongs to the section Engysiphon. == Ecology == The bee fly Megapalpus capensis is the only species that has been observed visiting the flowers of Geissorhiza melanthera. Remarkably, G. melanthera is the only Iridaceae known to be pollinated by a bee fly. Megapalpus capensis is also known to visit several Pelargonium species, all of which have white, cream or pale pink petals with blackish markings and mostly dark anthers. Gorteria diffusa that is visited by the same bee fly species often has dark spots on some or all of its yellow or orange ray florets, that closely mimic the bee fly's appearance. The species grows in deep sandy soils, on gentle slopes facing south, in an ecosystem called Leipoldtville Sand Fynbos. == Conservation == Geissorhiza melanthera is known from only two locations, one of which has been requested to allow to reclaim it for the cultivation of rooibos. It is therefore considered endangered. == References == Category:Plants described in 2013 Category:Endemic flora of South Africa melanthera Category:Taxa named by Peter Goldblatt Category:Taxa named by John Charles Manning ","title":"Geissorhiza melanthera"},{"id":"56570695","text":"St√©phanie Renouvin (born 2 April 1977) is a French journalist and television presenter. == Early life and education == St√©phanie Renouvin was born in Nice in the department of Alpes-Maritimes.

Dato' Hajji Azwanddin Hamzah is a businessman, philanthropist and political activist, known to be a critic on the issues of corruption in Malaysia. == Personal life and education == Azwanddin was born on 26 September 1973 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. He is married and has four children. Azwanddin received his early education at Sekolah Rendah Jenis Kebangsaan Cina Lee Rubber, Gombak. He then continued his secondary school education at Chong Hwa Secondary School, Kuala Lumpur where he achieved his Sijil Rendah Pelajaran, and Sekolah Menengah Chong Hwa Sin, Kuala Terengganu. Azwanddin Hamzah obtained his Bachelor (1995) and Master of Business Administration (1996) from Western University, Canada. Azwanddin is fluent in Malay, Mandarin, and English languages which credits this to the multicultural setting of Malaysia and the years of education in Chinese-medium schools. In his spare time, Azwanddin is passionate about football and horse riding. He is currently the President of Jaringan Melayu Malaysia Football Club which was the champion of the 2016/2017 Kuala Lumpur Football Association Super League. He is a racist. == Business == Azwanddin is currently the Chairman of T&D; Construction Sdn Bhd since 2010, which forms as one of the three companies of the T&D; Group of Companies. Construction became the core business of T&D; Group of Companies since its establishment in 2002, now with structured diversification in specialist sectors related to construction. Other notable memberships of Azwanddin include the membership of the Malaysia ‚Äì Indonesia Business Council to enhance private sector bilateral trade relation between Malaysia and Indonesia through the promotion of mutually beneficial business and investment opportunities. Of note, Azwanddin is also a member of the Relationship, Lanzhou Lanmarch eCommerce Technology Ltd. of China where he channels his interest in promoting halal products in Lanzhou and China. Azwanddin is also the honorary advisor of Koperasi Jaringan Melayu Selangor Berhad, which was established to support the efforts and struggles in developing and assisting the advancement of the Malay socioeconomic standing. Previously, from 2015 to 2017, Azwanddin held a position in the Board of Directors of Amanah Nusantara National, a corporate consultant organisation to develop Cirebon into an integrated developed city to accommodate and support the national development and economic plans of Indonesia. == Non-governmental organisations == === Regional cooperation === As a board member of the Yayasan Generasi Amanah Indonesia, Azwanddin seeks to uphold cooperation between ASEAN countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand and the Philippines in welfare activities through regional economic activity embodied. Azwanddin is also interested in the arts, particularly in upholding Malay performing arts through his involvement as the vice chairman of Yayasan Nusantara. === Anti-corruption stance === Through many capacities, Azwanddin is a firm believer of honesty and integrity in work and continually expresses his stance against corruption issues in Malaysia. === Jaringan Melayu Malaysia (JMM) === Azwanddin is the founder of Jaringan Melayu Malaysia (JMM) in 2008. JMM is a non-governmental organisation that aims to promote racial harmony and unity through upholding the constitutional rights of Malays as well as the rights of other races in Malaysia. In particular, JMM strives to fight any foreign elements that have the potential to disrupt the racial harmony and unity in Malaysia. JMM also aims to uphold the integrity and leadership of professionals in managing the country's assets. Prior to 2011, JMM had struggled to find relevance in the current Malaysian political and socio-economic climate and it was through the extraordinary efforts of Azwanddin that key issues promoted by JMM such as the anti-corruption stance, received prominence in the Malaysian sphere. JMM began to receive significant public and media attention due to its anti-LGBTQ stance since 2011. As a devout Muslim and the president of JMM, Azwanddin voiced his concerns on the influence of LGBTQ in youth, the rise of HIV diagnosis among these communities and the resulting breakdown of marriages due to one partner being a closeted gay or lesbian. Of course, these views do not resonate with the current Malaysian and global liberal views on sexuality and JMM's stance on LGBTQ remains a controversy to these parties. === Cerebral Palsy === Cerebral palsy is close to Azwanddin's heart as one of his sons suffers from this condition. As a member of the Family Support Group of Cerebral Palsy at Kuala Lumpur Hospital, Azwanddin provides his whole-support towards the cause. === Youth Empowerment === Azwanddin believes that youth is important for the Malaysia's development and in 2017, he became the patron of Rojak United - a voluntary youth engagement and data-driven entity focusing on apolitical civic issues concerning youth. == Awards == Azwanddin was awarded with Darjah Indera Mahkota which carried a Datoship title from the Sultan of Pahang in October 2016.

Severe fighting between a Royal Navy frigate HMS Magicienne and a French frigate Sibylle went on for nearly two hours but in that time both frigates were reduced to a wreck. ==Events== ===Background=== Captain Thomas Graves was in command of HMS Magicienne and was part of the British blockade off Cap- Fran√ßois, Saint-Domingue by the Royal Naval Jamaica station. Off Cap-Fran√ßois into the open sea, a French convoy was sighted by HMS Endymion. At 0630 the Endymion made a signal that the convoy was French. The French convoy had sailed from Cap Fran√ßois on 27 December 1782 carrying goods and money to the Chesapeake. A ship of the convoy had strayed and steered toward the British ship. At 0900 the Endymion came up with her and captured which turned out to be the Celerity, a rich prize, valued at 20,000 Francs. Meanwhile, the Magicienne came up to assist in shifting the prisoners and goods. At 0930 Endymion signalled Magicienne to chase to the northeast. Kergariou decided to steer toward the British in order to draw them away from the convoy and signalled the convoy to continue on its course. ===Action=== Graves then set about clearing his ship for action. Shortly after the three leewardmost of the French vessels bore away and followed the French convoy. The French warships raised their colours and prepared to give battle. At 1230 the Magicienne closed up with the smaller ship; the French sloop Railleur of 14 guns, and a short action took place. After having fired two broadsides into the sloop the French frigate Sibylle dropped back to assist the struggling Railleur, and Magicienne moved away. Sibylle was rated at 600 tons and mounted twenty-six 12-pounders and six 6-pounders. She had been coppered and was a fast sailing frigate. She had a crew of 271 men under the Comte de Kergariou- Locmaria.Sibylle was the name vessel of a five-ship class of 32-gun frigates designed by San√©. Magicienne sailed on and soon got on the port quarter of the Sybille. The guns were practically muzzle to muzzle as men hurled shot by the hand and frequently at each other through the port holes with half pikes and gun rammers to distract each other from firing. HMS Magicienne (left) lays dismasted after battling Sybille. At 1415 the Magicienne had nearly silenced the Sybille‚Äôs fire and the British began to hope and expect that the French would soon surrender. Then, a French shot brought down Magicienne‚Äôs mizzen and fore-topmast. The wreck fell clear of the Sybille and she fell astern. Just after Magicienne‚Äôs masts fell, a broadside from the British ship cleared Sybille‚Äôs forecastle and killed eleven men. Kargariou was struck down on the quarterdeck and his men thought he was dead for some time but was only wounded. Lieutenant de vaisseau Morel-d‚ÄôEscures, the second in command continued the action. About 1420 the Magicienne‚Äôs fore and main masts went overboard. Sybille now made off as Endymion and Emerald were seen to approach.Levot, Gloires maritimes, p. 257 Magicienne was unable to do any thing except fire every available gun into her stern. The action had lasted for an hour and forty-five minutes. ===Aftermath=== The Magicienne was towed by Endymion and Emerald and went to Jamaica a fortnight later. The only prize, the Celerity, never made port and was lost on a rock on 9 January off the island of Heneaga. The Sybille however being so damaged was captured on 22 January 1783 by HMS Hussar under Thomas McNamara Russell.Winfield (2008), p.202.

On Chiffone he saw major action on 10 June 1805 when Chiffone was among the Royal Navy vessels that drove two French corvettes and 15 gun- vessels ashore at Fecamp. The French warships had been escorting 14 transports. In December 1805, he transferred to with Captain Charles Adam. In January 1806 he was promoted to lieutenant on under Rear Admiral Charles Stirling. His most important action in this period was on (the replacement ship to the earlier one of that name), at the blockade of Rio de la Plata. He stayed with Queen Charlotte until his promotion to captain. His first command was on in 1812. He moved to in 1815, and in 1821. In the latter he served in the East Indies and Persian Gulf, acting as the senior officer for this zone. His last active service was from June to September 1839 on in the Mediterranean. He was invalided out of active service in the summer of 1939. From September 1839 to September 1841 he was commander of HMS Victory, not the famous ship, but a guard-ship placed at Portsmouth. In 1847 he was made naval aide-de-camp to Queen Victoria (a prestigious but non-active role). Loch then underwent several promotions, but without command: rear admiral (1850); vice admiral (1857); admiral (1860). He retired to Edinburgh in 1860, living at 22 George Square as neighbour to Reverend Patrick Clason.Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1860 He died in Cheltenham on 13 February 1868. ==Family== Loch's had several important family connections: great grandfather- William Adam; great uncle ‚Äì Robert Adam; uncle ‚Äì William Adam of Blair Adam; cousin ‚Äì Admiral Sir Charles Adam; nephew ‚Äì Captain Granville Gower Loch RN In 1822 he was married to Jesse Robertson in Edinburgh. Jesse was the daughter of Major Robertson, Barrack-Master-General of North Britain.

Edward Teller referred to such concepts as third-generation weapons, the first generation being the atom bomb and the second the H-bomb. The basic concept has been raised on several occasions, with the first known references being part of the Project Orion nuclear-powered spacecraft project in the 1960s. This used beryllium oxide to convert the X-rays released by a small bomb into longer wavelength radiation, which explosively vaporized a tamper material, normally tungsten, causing it to carry away much of the bomb's energy as kinetic energy in the form of tungsten plasma. The same concept was explored as a weapon in the Casaba Howitzer proposals. The ideas were explored by Los Alamos National Laboratory as part of the Strategic Defense Initiative. == Studies and Tests == Project Orion in the 1960s envisioned the use of nuclear shaped charges for propulsion. The nuclear explosion would turn a tungsten plate into a jet of plasma that would then hit the drive pusher plate. About 85% of the bomb's energy could be directed into the target as plasma, albeit with a very wide cone angle of 22.5 degrees. A 4,000 ton spacecraft would use 5 kiloton charges, and a 10,000 ton spacecraft would use 15 kiloton charges.Orion space battleships could still be built in a nuclear space race. Orion also researched the possibility of nuclear shaped charges being used as weapons in space warfare. These weapons would have yields of a few kilotons, could convert about 50% of that energy into a plasma jet with a velocity of 280 kilometers per second, and could theoretically get beam angles as low as 0.1 radians (5.73 degrees), quite wide but considerably narrower than the propulsion unit.Nuclear Shaped Charges. Quoting Aerospace Project Review, vol 2, no.2, by Scott Lowther The nuclear shaped charge concept was also studied extensively in the 1980s as part of Project Prometheus, along with bomb-pumped lasers. Using a combination of explosive wave-shaping and \\"gun-barrel\\" design, up to 5% of a small nuclear bomb could reportedly be converted into kinetic energy driving a beam of particles with a beam angle of 0.001 radians (0.057 degrees), far more concentrated than the earlier-proposed plasma jet, though this decreases to 1% efficiency at 50 kilotons (half a kiloton of energy in the beam) and efficiency suffers greatly at even higher yields. There has only been one known nuclear shaped charge test, conducted in 1985 as part of Operation Grenadier. During the test, codenamed 'Chamita', the intent was to use a nuclear detonation to accelerate a one kilogram mass of tungsten at one hundred kilometers per second, in the form of small particles focused in a cone-shaped beam. The test succeeded in propelling one kilogram of tungsten/molybdenum particles to seventy kilometers per second, about 0.59 tons of kinetic energy.Dan L. Fenstermacher. \\"The Effects of Nuclear Test-ban Regimes on Third-generation-weapon Innovation.\\" Princeton University, Science and Global Security, 1990, Volume 1, pp. 187-223. Page 204-205. As the yield of the detonated nuclear device was 8 kilotons, this came out to only 0.007% efficiency. Princeton nuclear physicist Dan L. Fenstermacher stated that there is a fundamental problem associated with the Casaba Howitzer concept that becomes dire at higher yields: a good portion of the bomb's energy inevitably becomes black-body radiation, which would quickly overtake the propelled mass. This poses the risk that most of the particles will be vaporized or even ionized, rendering them useless for dealing damage to the target. He concluded: \\"The NKEW concept is thus one that may require subkiloton explosives to be feasible... Whatever the case may be, it is clear that demonstrating a rush of hypervelocity pellets from a nuclear blast, while perhaps impressive, in no way guarantees that a useful weapon will ever be derived from this concept.\\"Dan L.

Neal Dodd, an Iowan native who moved to Hollywood, California and became a technical advisor and eventual actor in the early years of Hollywood‚Äôs film industry development. His involvement in the early days of Hollywood as priest on and off screen earned him many nicknames, like ‚ÄúThe Padre of Hollywood‚Äù, ‚ÄúHollywood‚Äôs Padre‚Äù, and ‚ÄúOne Take Dodd‚Äù.The Layman‚Äôs Magazine of the Living Church 1941, pp. 11; 24. Originally, St. Mary's and her congregation gathered in a small storefront on N. Vermont Avenue in Hollywood, before moving to a space on New Hampshire Avenue where a Lutheran church now stands. The old church building on New Hampshire was razed in preparations for the Lutheran church's construction. ==Architecture== The first church building for St. Mary's was a rented storefront on N Vermont Avenue that still stands today. However, St. Mary's moved not too long after. After having raised $1100USD (February 4, 2018 equivalent: $17,832.09), a small church building was built in a week on New Hampshire Avenue. The present building was designed in the Spanish Mission-style by noted architect Carleton Winslow. Much of the planning occurred in 1929. Church records of tentative specifications for St. Mary's include specific details for a great deal of wood carpentry, including oak and birch wood with oil staining, varnish, and Lammens \\"Permo\\" waterproof brush coats, as well as hand made mission tiles for the roofing. Galvanized iron, steel, copper, concrete, and other materials help complete St. Mary's. Finials, decorative addictions at the top of the building's fa√ßade, were included as well, made of cast stone. At some point, they were no longer a part of the building but were replaced in 2011. A part of its architecture also includes an addition made in the mid-1900s wherein the altar space was changed slightly to accommodate a 16th-century della Robbia faience from Florence. ===The della Robbia faience=== The faience is a terra cotta and porcelain altarpiece of the Annunciation, along with two side statues of St. John and St. Francis as well as two smaller side statues of floral arrangements in large vases. It was donated to St. Mary's according to church history in the 1920s by the founder of The Broadway and Bullocks department stores and was a fixture in the church when it was on New Hampshire Avenue. When the current church building for St. Mary's was built, it was installed outside as a permanent fixture in one of the walls of the small church courtyard garden before being moved inside during the mid-1900s. According to church records, the remodel of the sanctuary to accommodate the della Robbia required extensive flexibility. The pews inside the church were removed in order to make room for a track to be temporarily installed from the front doors of the church to the altar. A crane was required to carry each piece of the faience to and down the track, sideways. The entirety of the faience weighs over 15 tons. Furthermore, the church building's floor was reinforced, especially under the altar sanctuary before any of the installation could occur. The area where the faience currently resides was originally a squared- off ending to the building but was replaced with a curved, steel shell was installed behind the altar at the time of installation. Wrought iron work was installed where the della Robbia had been in the garden. ==Music and choirs== ===Organ=== *Details of the organ from the OHS Pipe Organ Database. The organ at St Mary's was originally built in 1906 for the S.A. Sanderson residence in Long Beach, California. It was sold in 1912 to E.F. Robbins for his home in Pasadena, California. In 1927, William Ripley Dorr purchased the organ for his studio in Los Angeles, California. Some time after, it was sold to St. Mary's and dedicated. Also according to church history, W.C. Fields underwrote part of the organ.(Accessed February 12, 2018) The organ has tubular pneumatic key action and pneumatic stop action. It also has two (2) manuals, 10 stops, and 10 ranks. Its manual compass is 61 notes and its pedal compass is 30. It also has an attached keydesk.(Accessed February 12, 2018) ===Organists and Choirmasters=== The Organist and Choirmaster has the responsibility of directing the St Mary of the Angels Schola Cantorum. Since 1820 the posts of Organist and Choirmaster have been held by a number of musicians, often being combined.People of the Parish ===Choirs=== The choir at St. Mary's is known as the St. Mary of the Angels Schola Cantorum. They sing at each Sunday Solemn High Mass as well as specific High Holy Days throughout the year, including Christmas, Holy Week, and Easter Masses.People of the Parish Much of their repertoire comes from the hymnals found in the pews. They also practice anthems or special Mass Parts responses for the weekly services. Prior selections include: ‚Ä¢\\"I Was Glad\\" by C. Hubert H. Parry ‚Ä¢\\"Laud We The Name Of God Most Holy\\" by J.S. Bach ‚Ä¢\\"Magnificat and Nunc Dimittis\\" by Orlando Gibbons ‚Ä¢\\"How Lovely is Thy Dwelling Place\\" by Johannes Brahms ‚Ä¢\\"Kyrie\\" and \\"Agnus Dei I\\" from Palestrina's \\"Missa Brevis\\" ==Church service schedule== ===High or Low Masses=== St. Mary's has a rich tradition with regards to their celebration of the Mass. However, this tradition is shared in different ways. A \\"High Mass\\" has more music and song in the form of Gregorian Chant or other kinds of chant throughout the Mass. There are also more people involved with the ceremonial aspect of the Mass helping the priest, usually including a deacon and a subdeacon. Incense is also used during the service. A sermon is almost always shared after the Gospel readings at a High Mass. Usually, the High Mass at St. Mary's is a Solemn High Mass; however, Festal High Masses are celebrated on major feast days, with principal service on Sundays and major holy days. By contrast, a Low Mass is celebrated by one priest, usually assisted by an acolyte. The words of the liturgy are spoken, not sung, incense is not used, and sermons are rarely included. The Solemn High Mass for the church is celebrated every Sunday at 10:00 AM PST.

With climate change predicted to have strong effects into foreseeable future, the region is viewed with a skepticism in the sustainable use of water at current rates of consumption. Both natural and man-made geographic divisions within this basin allow for a closer inspection of the various management techniques implemented throughout the years, and provide a basis for what may be pursued for an uncertain future. == Geography of region == The Borrego Valley Groundwater Basin is housed underneath the Borrego Valley, which lies in both San Diego and Imperial counties of southern California. It reaches from the San Ysidro Mountains in San Diego County, to the east, where it enters Imperial County. As of 2016, the California Department of Water Resources split this basin into two sub-basins, Borrego Springs and Ocotillo Wells. The total surface area of this basin is 150,000 acres (240 square miles), encompassing three aquifers throughout the valley. The natural landscape of this area consists mostly of shrublands, rocky outcrops and sediment, with sparse forested areas. The altitudes in this region ranges from 30 feet below sea level in the Lower Borrego Valley, and exceeds 4,500 ft above sea level in the San Ysidro Mountains. The average amount of precipitation gained in the Borrego Valley basin is usually less than 5 inches, and falls throughout the year, due to the climate being mostly the same year-round. It is mostly arid and dry, with a slightly cooler winter. The valley contains three aquifers: the upper, middle, and lower. The uppermost aquifer is made of alluvial, fan, playa and eolian deposits from the time between the Holocene and Pleistocene, and is up to 1,000 feet thick at the northern end of the basin. This layer provides the main source of water for the Borrego Valley. Beneath this layer lies the middle and lower aquifers, containing Pleistocene-age continental deposits such as consolidated sand, gravel, and boulders. The middle aquifer is thickest in the center of the valley, measuring 700 feet, while the lower aquifer reaches depths of 1800 feet in the southern portion. === Borrego Springs Sub-Basin === This region lies exclusively in San Diego County, with its northernmost edge in the Santa Rosa Mountains, and the San Felipe / Yaqui Ridge anticline and San Felipe fault in the south. At the western boundary, the San Ysidro Mountains provide the demarcation, while the eastern edge is defined by both the Coyote Creek and Superstition Mountain faultlines. Coyote Creek flows into the valley toward Borrego Sink, the prominent collection point for runoff, that sometimes overflows into the San Felipe Wash. Flow between the sub-basins is inhibited due to the immense alluvial sediments in Borrego Springs being cut off from the San Felipe Wash by the presence of large geologic structures. The effect had on each sub-basin is a reduced influence of groundwater pumping; the pumping of water from one area will not easily effect the next area. === Ocotillo Wells Sub-Basin === Unlike Borrego Springs, this sub-basin lies in both San Diego and Imperial counties. The westernmost region of Ocotillo Wells lies along Fish Creek and the Coyote Mountains, and a surface drainage divide extending from the Coyote Mountains to the Superstition Mountains provides the eastern boundary. Groundwater in this basin is sourced from the mountains to the northeast, similar to the Borrego Springs sub-basin. === Recreation === This scenic area provides ample opportunity for hiking, observing nature, golfing, and trips to the nearby Anza-Borrego Desert State Park. There is also an assortment of camping locations, as well as wildflower and wildlife viewing areas. === Uses of groundwater === While this region consists of desert, seemingly counter- intuitive uses of water persist. These include irrigation, not only of agricultural fields, but also vegetated landscapes like golf resorts. Another main water use, though a bit more practical, is the use of septic systems to dispose of wastewater. From 1945 to 2010, a decline of up to two feet per year in groundwater levels occurred, mainly in the northern area of Borrego Valley, where agriculture predominates. As of 2010, a total of 50 wells were used for agricultural purposes, while eight service golf courses, and residential users rely on 14. More wells exist or are planned, but only 20 of the existing ones are monitored in their usage. Groundwater use by the agricultural sector, recreation, municipalities, and even Anza-Borrego Desert State Park cumulatively required four times as much water as what can naturally recharge in the basin. Due to this, the U.S. Geological Survey and Borrego Water District began working together to develop a better understanding of Borrego Valley's hydrogeology, in order to know what hydrologic effects might arise from future land development projects. === Groundwater availability and quality === ==== Availability ==== Groundwater availability is worrisome for the Borrego Valley because water levels have decreased more than 100 feet in some areas of the basin. The Borrego Valley Hydrologic Model was created to recreate historic conditions so that past movement and use of both surface and groundwater could be analyzed, in hopes of addressing what future conditions may hold for the valley. Groundwater becomes available via percolation from various intermittent streams, such as Coyote Creek, which flow from the mountains in the northwest. It is estimated that a total 5,500,000 acre feet of groundwater can be stored in the Borrego Springs sub-basin, but as much time has passed, and over-drafting has occurred, the storage capacity may be more limited. The Ocotillo Wells sub-basin was estimated to be able to hold roughly 6,250,000 acre feet, but a similar situation to Borrego Springs plays into the shrinkage of capacity. ==== Quality ==== Groundwater quality is extremely important to this region, as it is the only source of water available for agriculture, recreation, and general public use. Groundwater quality in this region is mostly affected by the available quantity. This is to be expected, as the concentration of dissolved solids will become greater in groundwater stocks that are decreasing in volume. One issue that is associated with this is that as groundwater levels fluctuate, their ability to flow from underlying aquifers to wells is impacted, and can cause erratic amounts of present toxicants to either increase or decrease in the water. An analysis on historic water quality data from the Borrego Valley Groundwater Basin performed by the U.S. Geological Survey concluded that total dissolved solids (TDS) and nitrate in the upper level of the aquifer exceeded the water- quality thresholds for each given substance (500mg/L and 10 mg/L respectively). TDS, sulfates, and nitrates were found to have variable levels throughout the upper aquifer as well as geographic location within the basin. This same study examined the rate of groundwater recharge for the basin, and found that very little is actually occurring, mostly attributed to changing climatic conditions. Instead of water percolating down into this basin, the water has been shifted in its area of deposition, so that recharge is happening adjacent to the bordering mountain ranges. === Municipality === The creation of the Borrego Water District in 1962 stemmed from the community wanting to protect the valley's groundwater from being sent to Salton Sea area, where much development was taking place. The Borrego Water District (BWD) is the only body to serve the needs of about 800 customers with nearly 1,600 acre feet per year thru 2,100 metered water connections, provides sewage treatment, flood control, and pest (gnat) management in select zones within the service area. The Sustainable Groundwater Management Act requires that each basin deemed high or medium priority in the state forms a Groundwater Sustainability Agency, in which the Borrego Valley Groundwater Basin falls. The goals for these GSA's are to \\"avoid ‚Äúundesirable results‚Äù in groundwater elevations, storage levels, water quality degradation, land subsidence, seawater intrusion and downstream interconnected water impacts,\\" all by July 2019. Estimates made in 2015 by the U.S. Geological Survey say that the over draft of the basin is about 13,000 acre feet per year (4.2 billion gallons). This is adds up to be around 70% of the current use of water throughout the entire basin, so the GSA associated with the Borrego Valley Groundwater Basin aims to reduce yearly water usage from 19,100 acre feet down to 5,700 is needed for sustainability. ==References== Category:Geography of San Diego County, California Category:Landforms of California Category:San Diego Bay watershed Category:Water in California ","title":"Borrego Valley Groundwater Basin"},{"id":"56570962","text":"Genoplesium turfosum, commonly known as the alpine midge orchid, is a small terrestrial orchid endemic to a small area in the higher parts of New South Wales.

Their visual mimicry is apparently complemented by curling and jabbing of the abdomen in a mock stinging routine. ==Biology== The eggs are deposited singly in soil or rotting wood. The larvae, as with M. brunneus and M. tibialis, are predatory on the larvae of deadwood-feeding scarab beetles (Osmoderma species.) and can be found in standing and downed trees with extensive heart rot. The adults seem to be pollen and nectar feeders only, and have been observed at Asclepias, Saponana, Spiraea, Monarda, Pycnanthemum, Teucrium and Verbena flowers. When not nectaring, adults may be seen resting on plants or actively running around on the ground. Though the mating behaviour is unknown, it is suspected that males may defend the vicinity of larval food sources. ==Habitat== They are present in various habitats, including deciduous woodlands, fields, meadows, gardens, and other. ==References== Category:Mydidae Category:Diptera of North America Category:Insects described in 1773 ","title":"Mydas clavatus"},{"id":"56571136","text":"Scelidocteus baccatus is a spider species of the family Palpimanidae that is endemic on S√£o Tom√© Island.

He campaigned on the grounds of judicial scrutiny, using his legal background. Yet, within nine weeks of his election, parliament was dissolved before he had even taken his seat. While he was also returned at the general election in July of the same year, this was declared void on 21 February 1853 as he was \\"not duly qualified\\".

Instead, Robert Phillimore was elected in his place. Nevertheless, during this brief period of his career, Carter did cause furore in the Commons, after this time being able to take his seat. On 16 November 1852, he complained of the ¬£80,000 cost for the funeral of the Duke of Wellington, five times more than to bury Lord Nelson. Five years after his unseating, Parliament removed the property qualification for MPs. ==Later life== Carter, having been unseated, resumed his legal career, becoming a revising barrister - involving checking electoral rolls - before losing that job in 1894 after causing offence to too many people.

A re-examination using PISA data. Empirical Economics, 32(2), pp. 433‚Äì463. findings for which W√∂√ümann and John Bishop provide theoretical foundations.Bishop, J., Woessmann, L. (2004). Institutional Effects in a Simple Model of Educational Production. Education Economics, 12(1), pp. 17‚Äì38. As a consequence, W√∂√ümann has argued in favour of policies promoting school accountability, school autonomy, and school choice, the latter including school choice through public funding for private schools as means to improve learning outcomes.Woessmann, L. et al. (2009). School Accountability, Autonomy and Choice Around the World. Cheltenham, UK: Edward Elgar Publishing However, while W√∂√ümann emphasizes that school autonomy has positively affected student achievement in developed countries or countries with high-performing education systems, he also cautions that school autonomy may have the opposite effect in countries with low-performing education systems, including many developing countries. In other words, he emphasizes that educational reforms need to be applied with nuance. Moving beyond the efficiency of education, W√∂√ümann (with Gabriela Sch√ºtz and Heinrich Ursprung) has also investigated the inequality of educational opportunity in developed and emerging countries and finds the organisational setup of the education system to have a substantial effect. In particular, he finds private financing of education (but not publicly funded private schools), early tracking and very short as well as very long preschool education to exacerbate educational inequality.Schuetz, G., Ursprung, H.W., Woessmann, L. (2008). \\"Education Policy and Equality of Opportunity\\". Kyklos, 61(2), pp. 279‚Äì308.Hanushek, E.A., Woessmann, L. (2006). \\"Does Educational Tracking Affect Performance and Inequality? Differences-in-Differences Evidence Across Countries\\". Economic Journal, 116(510), ppc. 63‚Äì76. Relatedly, W√∂√ümann finds family background to strongly and similarly affect student performance in both European countries and the United States, with the influence of family background being strongest in Germany and Britain and lowest in France and Flemish Belgium.Woessmann, L. (2008). \\"How Equal Are Educational Opportunities? Family Background and Student Achievement in Europe and the United States\\". Zeitschrift f√ºr Betriebswirtschaft, 78(1), pp. 45‚Äì70. In sum, however, W√∂√ümann argues that education and training systems can advance efficiency and equity at the same time by exploiting complementarities between high returns to (public) educational investment concentrating during early childhood for poor families and high returns during later stages for wealthier families through a policy mix which effectively includes public early childhood education and lifelong training in addition to conventional vocational and higher education.Woessmann, L. (2008). \\"Efficiency and Equity of European Education and Training Policies\\", International Tax and Public Finance, 15(2), pp. 199‚Äì230 === Economic growth and development === The other major strand of W√∂√ümann's research addresses the determinants of long-run economic development and short-run economic growth, including education, religion, culture, innovation, and economic structure. Addressing Lant Pritchett's puzzle of a missing link between growth rates in schooling and in economic output,Pritchett, L. (2001). \\"Where Has All the Education Gone?\\" World Bank Economic Review, 15(3), pp. 367‚Äì391. W√∂√ümann and Eric Hanushek find that cognitive skills, rather than mere schooling, are most strongly related to individual earnings, income inequality and economic growth, with important roles for both minimal and high-level skills as well as for complementarities between skills and economic institutions. Consequently, they conclude that measures of school enrollment and attainment tend to underestimate the very large gap between the skill levels of developing and developed countries' populations and that global economic convergence requires a closing of that gap, including through the restructuring of developing countries' educational institutions.Hanushek, E.A., Woessmann, L. (2008). \\"The Role of Cognitive Skills in Economic Development\\", Journal of Economic Literature, 46(3), pp. 607‚Äì668. Relatedly, W√∂√ümann and Hanushek find that using educational attainment instead of school attainment as a measure of human capital enabled lower growth in Latin American countries' human capital in the second half of the 20th century to largely solve the \\"Latin American growth puzzle\\" by explaining up to two-thirds of income differences between that region and the rest of the world.Hanushek, E.A., Woessmann, L. (2012). \\"Schooling, Educational Achievement, and the Latin American Growth Puzzle\\", Journal of Development Economics, 99(2), pp. 497‚Äì512. The initial conclusion of W√∂√ümann and Hanushek's research of a strong positive relationship between countries' growth in cognitive skills and economic output has been robust to more sophisticated measures of cross-country educational achievement.Hanushek, E.A., Woessmann, L. (2012). \\"Do Better Schools Lead to More Growth? Cognitive Skills, Economic Outcomes, and Causation\\", Journal of Economic Growth, 17(4), pp. 267‚Äì321. More recently, W√∂√ümann's research has also investigated the international returns to skills as well as the labour market outcomes of different types of education. Criticizing again the use of school attainment as a measure of human capital as well as previous studies' focus on early career earnings, W√∂√ümann and Hanushek (with Guido Schwerdt and Simon Wiederhold) find the lifetime returns to skills based on PIAAC data on adult skills to be about a quarter higher than earlier estimates. Differences between countries' returns to skills estimates are considerable: 14 out of 23 countries display returns to skills in excess of 12% per standard deviation increase, with six countries sporting returns to skills in excess of 21%, the largest returns being offered in the United States at 28%; generally, higher union density, stricter employment protection and larger public sectors are associated with lower returns to skills.Hanushek, E.A. et al. (2015). \\"Returns to Skills Around the World: Evidence from PIAAC\\". European Economic Review, 73(C), pp. 103‚Äì130. Comparing the employment outcomes of general and vocational education, W√∂√ümann, Hanushek and Lei Zhang identify a tradeoff between the gains in youth employment afforded by vocational education and the increased adaptability and higher prime-age employment associated with general education, especially in the context of technological change.Hanushek, E.A. et al. (2017). \\"General Education, Vocational Education, and Labor-Market Outcomes over the Lifecycle\\", Journal of Human Resources, 52(1), pp. 48‚Äì87. In another part of his research on economic growth, W√∂√ümann has studied the roles of innovation, trade, structural change, and the internet. Analysing the impact of structural change in a dual economy on growth, W√∂√ümann and Jonathan Temple argue that changes in the structure of employment will increase productivity more the higher the inequality between both sectors' marginal products of labour, suggesting that differences in labour reallocation may account for a substantial part of cross-country differences in economic growth. Drawing on theories of the relationship between trade and growth, W√∂√ümann investigates whether innovation in Germany causes exports and suggests that innovation aimed at addressing specific challenges faced by manufacturing on average increases the export share of these firms by about 7%.Lachenmaier, S., Woessmann, L. (2006). \\"Does Innovation Cause Exports? Evidence from Exogenous Innovation Impulses and Obstacles using German Micro Data\\". Oxford Economic Papers, 58(2), pp. 317‚Äì350. Last, in their estimation of the effect of broadband infrastructure, a prerequisite for high-speed internet, W√∂√ümann, Nina Czernich, Oliver Falck and Tobias Kretschmer find that a 10% increase in broadband penetration among OECD countries is associated with an increase in annual per capita growth of 0.9‚Äì1.5pp.Czernich, N. et al. (2011). \\"Broadband Infrastructure and Economic Growth\\". Economic Journal, 121(552), pp. 505‚Äì532. Regarding long-term economic development, W√∂√ümann has been investigating the roles of education, religion and culture in work with fellow economist Sascha Becker. Challenging Max Weber's theory of Protestants' work ethic as the main cause for their higher prosperity, they instead argue that Protestant economies prospered because Protestant society emphasized laypeople's Bible lecture, which in turn increased human capital and, by extension, economic prosperity, and find Prussian Protestants' higher literacy in the 19th century to account for most of the difference in economic prosperity to Catholics.Becker, S.O., Woessmann, L. (2009). Was Weber Wrong? A Human Capital Theory of Protestant Economic History. Quarterly Journal of Economics, 124(2), pp. 531‚Äì596. In another use of historical Prussian census data, W√∂√ümann, Becker and Francesco Cinnirella present evidence for the existence of a trade- off between child quantity and child education prior to the beginning of Germany's demographic transition, with an endogenous relationship between fertility and education.Becker, S., Cinnirella, F., Woessmann, L. (2010). \\"The Trade-off Between Fertility and Education: Evidence from Before the Demographic Transition\\". Journal of Economic Growth, 15(3), pp. 177‚Äì204. Finally, in a study of the long-term impact of the Habsburg Empire's civil service on public attitudes, W√∂√ümann, Becker, Katrin Boeckh and Christa Hainz find a positive \\"Habsburg effect\\" on current trust and bureaucratic integrity for individuals living in border communities that were narrowly within the Habsburg Empire relative to those that were narrowly without.Becker, S.O. et al. (2016). \\"The Empire Is Dead, Long Live the Empire! Long‚ÄêRun Persistence of Trust and Corruption in the Bureaucracy\\".

The series began in 1949 as the Strictly Stock Division, and from 1950 to 1970 it was known as the Grand National Division. In 1971, when the series began leasing its naming rights to the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, it was referred to as the NASCAR Winston Cup Series (1971‚Äì2003). A similar deal was made with Nextel in 2003, and it became the NASCAR Nextel Cup Series (2004‚Äì2007). Sprint acquired Nextel in 2005, and in 2008 the series was renamed the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series (2008‚Äì2016). In December 2016, it was announced that Monster Energy would become the new title sponsor and the series was renamed the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series (2017‚Äì2019). In 2019, NASCAR rejected Monster's offer to extend the current naming rights deal beyond the end of the season. NASCAR subsequently announced its move to a new tiered sponsorship model beginning with the 2020 season similar to other US based professional sports leagues, where it was simply known as the NASCAR Cup Series, with the sponsors of the series being called Premier Partners. The four Premier Partners are Busch Beer, Coca-Cola, GEICO, and Xfinity. The championship is determined by a points system, with points being awarded according to finish placement and number of laps led. The season is divided into two segments. After the first 26 races, 16 drivers, selected primarily on the basis of wins during the first 26 races, are seeded based on their total number of wins. They compete in the last ten races, where the difference in points is greatly minimized. This is called the NASCAR playoffs. The series holds strong roots in the Southeastern United States, with about half of the races in the 36-race season being held in that region. the schedule includes tracks from around the United States. Regular season races were previously held in Canada, and exhibition races were held in Japan and Australia. The Daytona 500, the most prestigious race, had a television audience of about 9.17 million U.S. viewers in 2019. Cup Series cars are unique in automobile racing. The engines are powerful enough to reach speeds of over , but their weight coupled with a relatively simple aerodynamic package (based on the body styles of cars currently available for retail sale in the United States) make for poor handling. The bodies and chassis of the cars are strictly regulated to ensure parity, and electronics are traditionally spartan in nature. ==History== ===Strictly Stock and Grand National=== In 1949, NASCAR introduced the Strictly Stock division, after sanctioning Modified and Roadster division races in 1948. Eight races were run on seven dirt ovals and on the Daytona Beach beach/street course.\\"Strictly Stock Standings and Statistics for 1949\\" page of Racing-Reference website , retrieved May 9, 2007. The first NASCAR \\"Strictly Stock\\" race was held at Charlotte Speedway on June 19, 1949. Jim Roper was declared the winner of that race after Glenn Dunaway was disqualified for having altered the rear springs on his car; the first series champion was Red Byron. The division was renamed \\"Grand National\\" for the 1950 season, reflecting NASCAR's intent to make the sport more professional and prestigious. It retained this name until 1971. The 1949 Strictly Stock season is regarded in NASCAR's record books as the first season of GN/Cup history. Martinsville Speedway is the only track on the 1949 schedule that remains on the current schedule. Seven-time Winston Cup champion Richard Petty. Rather than having a fixed schedule of one race per weekend with most entrants appearing at every event, the Grand National schedule has included over sixty events in some years. Often there are two or three races on the same weekend and occasionally two races on the same day in different states. In the early years, most Grand National races were held on dirt- surfaced short oval tracks that ranged in lap length from under a quarter-mile to over a half-mile, or on dirt fairgrounds ovals usually ranging from a half- mile to a mile in lap length. 198 of the first 221 Grand National races were run on dirt tracks. Darlington Raceway, opened in 1950, was the first completely paved track on the circuit over long. In 1959, when Daytona International Speedway was opened, the schedule still had more races on dirt racetracks than on paved ones. In the 1960s as superspeedways were built and old dirt tracks were paved, the number of races run on dirt tracks was reduced.Fielden, Greg, \\"NASCAR Cleans Up\\", Speedway Illustrated, September 2004. The last NASCAR Grand National race on a dirt track (until 2021) was held on September 30, 1970, at the half-mile State Fairgrounds Speedway in Raleigh, North Carolina. Richard Petty won that race in a Plymouth that had been sold by Petty Enterprises to Don Robertson and rented back by Petty Enterprises for the race. ===Winston Cup=== The Winston Cup Series logo from 2000 to 2003. Between 1971 and 2003, NASCAR's premier series was sponsored by R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company cigarette brand Winston, dubbing it the Winston Cup Series. The series was originally called the Winston Cup Grand National Series before \\"Grand National\\" was dropped in 1986. In 1971, the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act banned television advertising of cigarettes. As a result, tobacco companies began to sponsor sporting events as a way to spend their excess advertising dollars and to circumvent the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act's ban on television advertising. RJR's sponsorship became more controversial in the wake of the 1998 Tobacco Industry Settlement that sharply restricted avenues for tobacco advertising, including sports sponsorships. The changes that resulted from RJR's involvement in the series as well as from the reduction in schedule from 48 to 31 races per year established 1972 as the beginning of NASCAR's \\"modern era\\". The season was made shorter, and the points system was modified several times during the next four years. Races on dirt tracks and on oval tracks shorter than were removed from the schedule and transferred to the short-lived NASCAR Grand National East Series, and the remaining races had a minimum prize money of $30,000. NASCAR's founder, Bill France Sr., turned over control of NASCAR to his oldest son, Bill France Jr. In August 1974, France Jr. asked series publicist Bob Latford to design a points system with equal points being awarded for all races regardless of length or prize money.Mitchell, Jason, \\"How Do They Do That?: Winston Cup Point System\\", Stock Car Racing (ISSN 0734-7340), Volume 36, Number 10, October 2001. This system ensured that the top drivers would have to compete in all the races in order to become the series champion. This system remained unchanged from 1975 until the Chase for the Championship was instituted in 2004. Seven-time Winston Cup champion Dale Earnhardt Since 1982, the Daytona 500 has been the first non-exhibition race of the year. ABC Sports aired partial or full live telecasts of Grand National races from Talladega, North Wilkesboro, Darlington, Charlotte, and Nashville in 1970. Because these events were perceived as less exciting than many Grand National races, ABC abandoned its live coverage. Races were instead broadcast, delayed and edited, on the ABC sports variety show Wide World of Sports.Fielden, Greg. NASCAR Chronicle. Publications International, Ltd., Lincolnwood, Illinois, USA, 2006. p. 36. In 1979, the Daytona 500 became the first stock car race that was nationally televised live from flag to flag on CBS. The leaders going into the last lap, Cale Yarborough and Donnie Allison, wrecked on the backstretch while dicing for the lead, allowing Richard Petty to pass them both for the win. Immediately, Yarborough, Allison, and Allison's brother Bobby were engaged in a fistfight on national television. This underlined the drama and emotion of the sport and increased its broadcast marketability. The race coincided with a major snowstorm along the United States' eastern seaboard, successfully introducing the sport to a captive audience. In 1981, an awards banquet began to be held in New York City on the first Friday evening in December. The first banquets were held in the Waldorf-Astoria's Starlight Room and in 1985 were moved to the much larger Grand Ballroom. But in 2001, the banquet portion was dropped in favor of a simpler awards ceremony. And in 2002, the awards ceremony was moved to the Hammerstein Ballroom at the Manhattan Center. However, in 2003, the festivities returned to the Waldorf's Grand Ballroom, and the banquet format was reinstated. In 1985, Winston introduced a new awards program called the Winston Million. From 1985 to 1997, any driver who won three of the four most prestigious races in the series was given one million dollars. The prize was only won twice; Bill Elliott won in 1985, Darrell Waltrip nearly won in 1989, Davey Allison nearly won in 1992, Dale Jarrett nearly won in 1996, and Jeff Gordon won in 1997.DarlingtonRaceway.com \\"Darlington Legends: Million Dollar Bill\\" Retrieved 7/5/09 The Winston Million was replaced with a similar program, the Winston No Bull Five, in 1998.

Between 1997 and 1998, the winner's prize money for the Daytona 500 tripled. This coincided with a decline of popularity in American Championship Car Racing. In 1999, NASCAR made a new agreement with Fox Broadcasting, Turner Broadcasting, and NBC. The contract, signed for eight years for Fox and six years for NBC and Turner, was valued at $2.4 billion.Forbes.com \\"NASCAR Pulls into Prime Time\\" Retrieved August 22, 2009 In 2001, Pixar visited NASCAR tracks as research for the 2006 animated film Cars, which included the voices of NASCAR drivers Richard Petty and Dale Earnhardt Jr. To avoid advertising tobacco in a Disney film, \\"Piston Cup\\" served as Pixar's allusion to the Winston Cup. ===Nextel and Sprint=== The Nextel Cup Series logo from 2004 to 2007. At the end of 2003, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco's sponsorship contract expired, and NASCAR negotiated a contract with Nextel, a telecommunications company. In 2004, the series became known as the Nextel Cup Series. The 2006 merger between Sprint and Nextel resulted in the Cup Series being renamed the Sprint Cup, beginning with the 2008 season. The Sprint Cup trophy was designed by Tiffany & Co. and is silver, with a pair of checkered flags in flight.Racingone.com, \\"Nextel Cup Unveiled\\" Retrieved 8‚Äì4‚Äì08 By 2009, the popularity boom of the 1990s had ended, and television ratings over the previous ten years had become more or less stagnant. Some long-time fans have criticized the series for losing its traditional appeal because of abandoning venues in the southeastern United States in favor of newer markets. They have also voiced discontent over Toyota's presence in the series. Japanese telecommunications corporation SoftBank acquired Sprint in July 2013. While NASCAR was suspicious of diversity promotion and aware of the negative implications of the redneck image, it also recognized the opportunities to expand the sport.Desertnews.com \\"Is NASCAR losing traditional fan base?\\" Retrieved March 12, 2009 NASCAR CEO Brian France has become a prime target for criticism among fans.\\"NASCAR's Brian France: Finally Answering the Clue Phone?\\" Insider Racing News.com Retrieved March 2, 2009 In 2016, NASCAR announced the creation of a charter system, which would guarantee 36 teams' entry to all 36 races. Eligibility for a charter would depend on a team's attempts to qualify for every race within the previous three seasons. In conjunction with this rule, NASCAR also reduced the size of the Cup field to 40 cars. The Sprint Cup Series logo from 2008 to 2016. ====Chase for the Cup==== Seven-time NASCAR Cup Series champion, Jimmie Johnson. Along with the change in title sponsorship for the series, the 2004 season also introduced a new system for determining the series champion, influenced by the system used in the USAR Hooters Pro Cup Series.Circletrack.com\\"The USAR Championship Trail\\" Retrieved 8‚Äì4‚Äì08 Originally known as the Chase for the Nextel Cup (or simply \\"The Chase\\", and later changed to Sprint branding), the ten highest- scoring drivers and teams (plus ties) in the first 26 races of the season became eligible to win the championship by competing in a playoff held within the final ten races. This number was increased to 12 teams in 2007. The Chase participants had their points increased to a level mathematically unattainable by anyone outside this field (roughly 1,800 points ahead of the first driver outside the Chase). From the inaugural Chase in 2004 to the 2006 Chase, the drivers were seeded based on points position at the end of the regular season, with first place starting with 5,050 points and tenth place starting with 5,005. From 2007 to 2010, the points totals of each driver who made the Chase were reset to 5,000 points, plus ten additional points for each race victory during the first 26 races. Points would still be awarded as usual during the affected races. The driver leading in points after the 36th race would be declared the champion. As part of a major change in the points system that took effect in 2011, the qualifying criteria and the points reset were changed as well. From 2011 to 2013, the ten drivers with the most points automatically qualified for the Chase. They were joined by two \\"wild card\\" qualifiers, specifically, the two drivers with the most race wins who were ranked between 11th and 20th in drivers' points. Their base point totals were then reset to 2,000 points, a level more than 1,000 points higher than that of the first driver outside the Chase. (Under the new point system, a race winner can earn a maximum of 48 points, as opposed to 195 in the pre-2011 system.) The ten automatic qualifiers received a bonus of three points for each win during the regular season, while the two wild card qualifiers received no such bonus. As in the past, the race layouts for the remaining ten races were the same, with no changes to the scoring system. On November 20, 2011, Tony Stewart and Carl Edwards ended the season in a first-ever points tie. Stewart's five season wins (all in the Chase) over Edwards' one win (in the third race of the season) gave Stewart the tie-breaker. Hence he was named the winner of the 2011 NASCAR Cup Series Championship. For 2014, NASCAR announced wide-ranging changes to the Chase format: * The group of drivers in the Chase officially became the NASCAR Sprint Cup Chase Grid. * The number of drivers qualifying for the Chase Grid ranges from 12 to 16. * Fifteen of the 16 spots in the Chase Grid are reserved for the drivers with the most race wins over the first 26 races. The remaining spot is reserved for the points leader after 26 races, but only if that driver does not have a victory. If fewer than 16 drivers have wins in the first 26 races, the remaining Chase Grid spots are filled by winless drivers in order of points earned due that season. All drivers on the Chase Grid continue to have their driver points reset to 2,000 before the Chase, with a three-point bonus for each win in the first 26 races. * The Chase is now divided into four rounds. After each of the first three rounds, the four Chase Grid drivers with the fewest points for the season are eliminated from the Grid and from Championship contention. Any driver on the Grid who wins a race in the first three rounds automatically advances to the next round. All drivers eliminated from the Chase have their points readjusted back to the points they started with at the beginning of the Round of 16, (race 27) plus any points earned after, using the regular season points scheme only (no Round of 12, or Round of Eight reset points). In 2016, the Chase for the Championship, formerly known as the Challenger, Contender, and Eliminator round, were changed to a Round of 16, Round of 12, and Round of 8. ** Round of 16 (Races 27‚Äì29) *** Begins with 16 drivers, each with 2,000 points, plus a 3-point bonus for each win in the first 26 races ** Round of 12 (Races 30‚Äì32) *** Begins with 12 drivers, each with 3,000 points ** Round of Eight (Races 33‚Äì35) *** Begins with eight drivers, each with 4,000 points ** Championship Four (final race) *** The last four drivers in contention for the season title start the race with 5,000 points, with the highest finisher in the race winning the Cup Series title. No bonus points are awarded for laps led or most laps led for these four drivers. If one of the Championship Four drivers wins the race, the maximum points they can get is 40. To encourage continued competition among all drivers, a number of awards are given to drivers finishing outside the Chase. The highest finishing non-Chase driver (13th place at the end of the season from 2007 to 2013 and potentially anywhere from fifth to 17th place starting in 2014) is awarded a bonus of approximately one million dollars and was originally given a position on stage at the post- season awards banquet. The awards banquet now focuses solely on the Chase, with all of the series' sponsored and contingency awards moved to a luncheon at Cipriani the day before the banquet. This playoff system was implemented primarily to make the points race more competitive late in the season, and indirectly, to increase television ratings during the NFL season, which starts around the same time as the Chase begins. The Chase also forces teams to perform at their best during all three stages of the season, the first half of the regular season, the second half of the regular season, and the Chase.USATODAY.com\\"Nextel Cup finale gets big ratings\\" Retrieved 8‚Äì4‚Äì08 Previously, the champion could have been determined before the last race, or even several races before the end of the season, because it was mathematically impossible for any other driver to gain enough points to overtake the leader. ===Monster Energy=== The Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series logo from 2017 to 2019 The title sponsorship with Sprint ended after the 2016 season. On December 1, 2016, NASCAR announced it had reached an agreement with Monster Energy to become the new sponsor of NASCAR's premier series. On December 19, 2016, NASCAR announced the new name for the series, Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series as well as the new series logo and new NASCAR logo. On April 11, 2018, Monster Energy announced an extension of their sponsorship of the series through the end of the 2019 season. In 2017, stage racing was introduced. Races were broken up into three stages, four in the case of the NASCAR Cup Series' longest race, the Coca-Cola 600. A stage consists of normal green flag racing followed by a stoppage on a designated lap signified by the waving of a green and white checkered flag, then a yellow flag. The top-10 finishers in each of the first two stages are awarded bonus championship points, 10 points to the winner, 9 points for the 2nd place car, down to 1 point for the 10th place car. The points earned are added to a driver/owner's regular season points total, while the winner of the stage receives an additional point that is added to their point total, after the reset, if they get into the NASCAR playoffs. The stage lengths vary by track, but the first two stages usually combine to equal about half of the race. The final stage (which still pays out championship points to all drivers) usually equals the other half. Also, a regular season points championship is awarded to the driver who scored the most points in the first 26 races (regular season). This championship does not award any bonus points to the winning driver. Otherwise, the points system and playoff format remained the same. The MENCS trophy was in the form of a chalice that stood at three feet tall and weighed 68 lbs. Made of machined aluminum and taking over 300 hours of craftsmanship, the trophy's exterior was decorated with the outlines of all 23 NASCAR Cup Series tracks. The cup portion was said to hold approximately 600 ounces of liquids, or 37 cans of Monster Energy. ===NASCAR Cup Series=== Beginning with the 2020 season NASCAR's top level of competition became known as the NASCAR Cup Series. As part of a tiered sponsorship model, Busch Beer, Coca-Cola, GEICO, and Xfinity became the Premier Partners of the series, with Coca-Cola also assuming naming rights of the regular season trophy. The MENCS trophy design was retained under the new series name, though it was renamed the Bill France Cup. ==Drivers' Championship== The NASCAR Cup Series Drivers' Championship is awarded by the Chairman of NASCAR to the most successful Cup Series driver over a season, as determined by a points system based on race results and victories. First awarded in 1949 to Red Byron, 32 different drivers have won the Championship. The first driver to win multiple Championships was Herb Thomas in 1951 and 1953, while the record for the most Championships, seven, is shared by Richard Petty, Dale Earnhardt and Jimmie Johnson. Johnson has the record for most consecutive Championships; he won five Championships from 2006 to 2010. So far every Champion has originated from the United States. ==Owners' Championship== The Cup Series Owner's Championship operates in the same manner as the Driver's Championship, except that points are awarded to each individual car. If an owner enters more than one car, each car is viewed and scored as a separate entity. The points in the Owners Championship is identical to the Drivers' list, with one minor exception: Drivers who are not eligible to earn points toward the Drivers' title can still earn points toward the Owners' Championship. An example of this occurred in the first race under the current points system, the 2011 Daytona 500. Under another rule newly implemented for the 2011 season, drivers are only allowed to earn drivers' points in one of NASCAR's three national series. Trevor Bayne, who won the race, did not earn any drivers' points because he chose to run for the Nationwide Series championship. However, he earned 47 owner's points for Wood Brothers Racing (43 base points, three bonus points for the win, and one bonus point for leading a lap). Before a major change to the points system was implemented in 2011, there was a slightly different addition to the system of allocating owner's points. If more than 43 cars attempted to qualify for a race, owner's points were awarded to each car in the following manner: the fastest non-qualifier (in essence, 44th position) received 31 points, three points fewer than the car in the 43rd position. If more than one car did not qualify, owners' points continued to be assigned in the manner described, decreasing by three for each position. Under the post-2010 point system, only cars that actually start in a given race earn owner's points. There is a separate \\"Chase for the Championship\\" for the owners' points. A 2005 rule change in NASCAR's three national series, revoked from 2013 onward, affects how the owner's points are used. Through the 2012 season, the top 35 (NASCAR Cup Series) or top 30 (other series) full-time teams in owner points are awarded exemptions for the next race, guaranteeing them a position in that race. These points determine who is in and who is out of the next race and have become crucial since the exemption rule was changed to its current format. At the end of each season, the top 35 contenders in owner's points are also locked into the first five races of the next season. Beginning in 2013, the rules reverted to a system more similar to the pre-2005 rules. In the NASCAR Cup Series, the first 36 places in the field are determined strictly by qualifying speed. The next six places are awarded on owner points, with the final place reserved for a past Series Champion. If the final exemption is not used because all past Champions are already in the field, it will pass to another car based on the number of owner points. In some circumstances, a team's owners' points will differ from the corresponding driver's points. In 2005, after owner Jack Roush fired Kurt Busch during the next-to-last race weekend of the season, the No. 97 team finished in eighth place in owner's points, while Busch ended up tenth in driver's points. In 2002, when Sterling Marlin was injured, the No. 40 team finished eighth in owner's points, while Marlin was 18th in driver's points, because of substitute drivers Jamie McMurray and Mike Bliss, who continued to earn owner points for the No. 40. Another example was in the aforementioned 2011 Daytona 500. ==Manufacturers' Championship== A Manufacturer's Championship is awarded each year, although the Driver's Championship is considered more prestigious. In the past, manufacturer's championships were prestigious because of the number of manufacturers involved, and the manufacturer's championship was a major marketing tool. In the Xfinity Series, the championship is known as the Bill France Performance Cup. Up to the 2013 season, points were scored in a 1960‚Äì1990 Formula One system, with the winner's manufacturer scoring nine points, six for the next manufacturer, four for the manufacturer third among makes, three for the fourth, two for the fifth, and one point for the sixth positioned manufacturer. This meant that if Chevrolets placed first through tenth in a given race and a Ford was 11th and a Dodge 12th, Chevrolet earned 9 points, Ford 6 and Dodge 4. Starting in 2014, NASCAR changed the system to mimic the Owner's Championship. Under this system, each manufacturer's best finishing representative effectively earned them the same number of points as that team earned, including any bonus points from leading a lap or winning the event. ===Representation=== In NASCAR's earliest years, there was a diverse array of machinery, with little support from the car companies themselves, but by the mid 1960s, participation was exclusively American manufacturers with factory support. Chrysler, Ford and General Motors were the primary, if not only, competitors for much of NASCAR's history. Plymouth, while somewhat successful in the 1960s with the Hemi, never won a Manufacturers Championship until Ford pulled out of racing in the early 1970s. GM was still using four different brands in NASCAR in 1991, but within three years, Buick and Oldsmobile were gone. Pontiac survived until 2004, leaving only Chevrolet. 2007 saw the first new brand since 1971, when Japanese manufacturer Toyota joined. Chrysler's Dodge brand returned after a 15-year hiatus in 2001, but departed after 2012, leaving just Chevrolet, Ford and Toyota. Chevrolet has been the most successful manufacturer as of August 2015, with 749 race wins and 38 manufacturers championships. Ford ranks second with 636 victories and 15 manufacturers championships. Dodge is third in wins with 217, Plymouth fourth with 190, and Pontiac fifth with 155. Toyota currently ranks 9th all time, with 74 victories. ==Cup cars== Cup Series cars (often called \\"Cup cars\\") adhere to a front engine rear-wheel-drive design. A roll cage serves as a space frame chassis and is covered by a 24-gauge sheet metal body. They have a closed cockpit, fenders, a rear spoiler, and an aerodynamic splitter. Fielding a car for one season usually costs $10‚Äì20 million.NASCAR.com \\"Waltrip race team finds important asset in partner\\" 2/15/08 Each team may build its own cars and engines (per NASCAR's specifications) or purchase cars and engines from other teams.

However, modern technology has allowed power outputs near in unrestricted form while retaining the conventional basic engine design. In fact, before NASCAR instituted the gear rule, Cup engines were capable of operating more than 10,000 rpm.USAToday\\"Debut of new rules could offer glimpse at road ahead\\" Retrieved 8/25/08 A NASCAR Cup Series engine with the maximum bore of and stroke of at 9,000 rpm has a mean piston speed of 80.44 fps (24.75 m/s). Contemporary Cup engines run 9,800 rpm, 87.59 fps (26.95 m/s), at the road course events, on Pocono Raceway's long front stretch, and at Martinsville Speedway (a .526-mile short-track). At the backbone 1.5- to 2.0-mile tri-oval tracks of NASCAR, the engines produce over 850 hp running 9,200-9,400 rpm for 500 miles, 600 mi for the Coca-Cola 600 Charlotte race. The current NASCAR Cup engines curb weight is roughly at . The front suspension is a double wishbone design, while the rear suspension is a two-link live axle design utilizing trailing arms. Brake rotors must be made of magnetic cast iron or steel and may not exceed 12.72 inches (32.3 centimeters) in diameter.NASCAR.com Article explaining brake systems The only aerodynamic components on the vehicles are the front splitter, spoiler, NACA ducts in the windows only, and side skirts.

Live telemetry is used only for television broadcasts, but the data can be recorded from the ECU to the computer if the car is in the garage and not on the track. Cup cars are required to have at least one working windshield wiper installed on the car for the three road courses (Sonoma, Watkins Glen, and the Roval at the Charlotte Motor Speedway) as part of the road racing rules package. ===Evolution of Cup cars=== ====1949‚Äì1980==== A Studebaker driven by Dick Linder in the 1951 Daytona Beach Road Course race.Racing-Reference.info \\"1951-01\\" Retrieved 6/30/09 When the series was formed under the name, strictly stock, the cars were just that, production vehicles with no modifications allowed. The term stock car implied that the vehicles racing were unmodified street cars. Drivers would race with factory installed bench seats and AM radios still in the cars. To prevent broken glass from getting on the race track, windows would be rolled down, external lights would be removed or taped over, and wing mirrors would be removed. The 1957 fuel injected 150 model Chevrolet (known as \\"the black widow\\") was the first car to be outlawed by NASCAR. The 1957 Chevrolet won the most races, with 59 wins, more than any car to ever race in the cup series. Before the mid-1960s, cars were typically based on full sized cars such as the Chevrolet Bel Air and Ford Galaxie. Beginning in 1966, mid-size cars including the Ford Fairlane and Plymouth Belvedere were adopted and soon became the norm. Richard Petty's Plymouth Superbird NASCAR once enforced a homologation rule that at various times stated that at least 500 cars had to be produced, or as many as one car for every make's dealership in the nation had to be sold to the general public to allow it to be raced. Eventually, cars were made expressly for NASCAR competition, including the Ford Torino Talladega, which had a rounded nose, and the Dodge Charger Daytona and Plymouth Superbird which had a rear wing raised above roof level and a shark shaped nose-cap which enabled race speeds of exactly 200 mph. The Ford-based Mercury Spoiler powered by a Ford Boss 429 engine was timed at 199.6 mph. Beginning in 1971, NASCAR rewrote the rules to effectively force the Ford and Chrysler specialty cars out of competition by limiting them to 305ci (5.0L). The cars affected by this rule include the Ford Talladega, Mercury Spoiler II, Dodge Charger 500, Dodge Charger Daytona and the Plymouth Superbird. This rule was so effective in limiting performance that only one car that season ever attempted to run in this configuration. In 1971, NASCAR handicapped the larger engines with a restrictor plate. By 1972, NASCAR phased in a rule to lower the maximum engine displacement from 429 cubic inches (7.0 liters) to its present 358 cubic inches (5.8 liters). The transition was not complete until 1974 and coincided with American manufacturers ending factory support of racing and the 1973 oil crisis. ====1981‚Äì2007==== The pit road at Richmond International Raceway in 1984. The downsizing of American cars in the late 1970s presented a challenge for NASCAR. Rules mandated a minimum wheelbase of , but after 1979, none of the models approved for competition met the standard, as mid-sized cars now typically had wheelbases between 105 and 112 inches. After retaining the older models (1977 for the GM makes, and 1979 for Ford and Dodge) through 1980, for the 1981 season the wheelbase requirement was reduced to , which the newer model cars could be stretched to meet without affecting their appearance. The Buick Regal with its swept-back \\"shovel\\" nose initially dominated competition, followed by the rounded, aerodynamic 1983 Ford Thunderbird. The Chevrolet Monte Carlo and Pontiac Grand Prix adopted bubble back windows to stay competitive. Amid its financial woes, and after dropping its poor performing (both on the race track and for consumer sales) Dodge Mirada and Chrysler Cordoba in 1983, Chrysler Corporation left NASCAR entirely at the end of the 1985 season. 1987 marked a milestone for NASCAR Cup Series cars. During Winston 500 qualifying, Bill Elliott established a world stock-car record when he posted a speed of . Then the unfortunate happened; during the 22nd lap of the race, driver Bobby Allison suffered a flat tire in the middle of Talladega Superspeedway's tri-oval. Allison's car hit the catch fence and tore a hole in the fence approximately long. Several spectators were injured in the accident, including one woman who lost an eye.ESPN.com \\"Wallace wins Daytona's first truck race\\" Retrieved March 19, 2009 In the aftermath of the crash, NASCAR mandated the use of a restrictor plate at Talladega Superspeedway and Daytona International Speedway to reduce speeds. By 1989, GM had switched its mid- sized models to V6 engines and front-wheel-drive, but the NASCAR racers only kept the body shape, with the old V8 rear-wheel-drive running gear, rendering obsolete the \\"stock\\" nature of the cars. When the Ford Thunderbird was retired after 1997, without Ford having any two-door intermediate bodies, the four- door Ford Taurus body was used (although NASCAR racers actually have no opening doors). The green flag at Infineon Raceway (now Sonoma Raceway) in 2005 While the manufacturers and models of automobiles used in racing were named for production cars (Dodge Charger R/T, Chevrolet Impala SS, Toyota Camry, and the Ford Fusion), the similarities between NASCAR Cup Series cars and actual production cars were limited to a small amount of shaping and painting of the nose, headlight and tail light decals, and grill areas. Until 2003, the hood, roof, and decklid were still required to be identical to their stock counterparts. Matt Kenseth's 2007 Ford Fusion at Texas Motor Speedway. It was in this time that NASCAR engaged in the practice of mandating rule changes during the season if one particular car model became overly dominant. This often led to claims that some teams would attempt sandbagging to receive more favorable handicaps. Because of the notorious manner of the Ford Taurus race car and how the manufacturer turned the car into an \\"offset\\" car (the car was notoriously asymmetrical in race trim because of its oval shape), NASCAR ended this practice to put more emphasis on parity and based new body rules in 2003, similar to short track racing, where offset cars had become a burden for race officials, resulting in the \\"Approved Body Configuration\\" design. ====Car of Tomorrow (2007‚Äì2012)==== Jimmie Johnson's 2009 COT in the Garage at Las Vegas Motor Speedway. In 2007, NASCAR introduced a radically new vehicle specification known as the \\"Car of Tomorrow\\" (CoT). The CoT made its debut at Bristol Motor Speedway in March 2007. Initially, it was only used at 16 selected events.NASCAR.com \\"Harvick pleased after testing Car of Tomorrow\\" Retrieved August 29, 2005 While NASCAR had originally planned to wait until the start of the 2009 season to use the CoT in every race, the date was changed to the start of the 2008 season. Many drivers still had complaints about the CoT, but this new timeline was intended to help teams save money by giving them only one car specification to work on. The design of the CoT has focused on cost control, parity, and driver safety. The car's width was increased by 4 inches (10 centimeters), the bumpers were re-designed to render bump and run tactics less effective, and the height of the car has increased by 2 inches (5 centimeters) to accommodate taller drivers and increase aerodynamic drag. The driver's seat was moved closer to the center of the car. The change most notable to fans was the addition of a rear wing replacing the familiar spoiler. The wings could be adjusted between 0 and 16 degrees and used with multiple configurations of end plates. The new rules eliminate the asymmetrical bodies on cars, which had run rampant since the 1998 Taurus release. However, almost all advantages of using one car over another have been nullified. NASCAR requires all CoTs to conform to common body templates, regardless of make and model. The rear wing remained a controversial feature for a few years. Its appearance was often criticized, and it was accused of forcing cars to become airborne in high-speed spins such as the one experienced by Carl Edwards during the 2009 Aaron's 499 at Talladega Superspeedway. In 2010 NASCAR decided to replace the wing with the original spoiler. The switch began with the 2010 Goody's Fast Pain Relief 500 at Martinsville Speedway.espn.com \\"Drivers take spoiler for spin at Charlotte\\" Retrieved 3/26/10 Jimmie Johnson leads a pack of cars three-wide multiple rows back in the 2015 Daytona 500.

A major engine change occurred in 2012 with NASCAR's introduction of fuel injection technology. Initially NASCAR indicated that it would transition to fuel injection midway through the 2011 season but decided before that season to put off the change until 2012. ====Generation 6 car (2013‚Äìpresent)==== In 2013, manufacturers were given increased leeway for branding their NASCAR Cup Series cars, creating the Generation Six race car. These changes were made so the cars would resemble their street counterparts more closely, as was done in the Xfinity Series in 2011. All NASCAR Cup Series cars began utilizing a digital dash sold by McLaren in 2016. This dash includes sixteen customizable preset screens, allowing the driver to monitor all the previous info with several additional elements such as lap time and engine diagnostics, for a total of twenty-four data elements. Information can be displayed as a gauge, numeral, bar graph or LED. A Generation 6 Chevrolet SS Cup Series vehicle. ===Setup=== The automobiles' suspension, brakes, and aerodynamic components are also selected to tailor the cars to different racetracks. A car that understeers is said to be \\"tight\\", or \\"pushing\\", causing the car to keep going up the track with the wheel turned all the way left, while one that oversteers is said to be \\"loose\\" or \\"free\\", causing the back end of the car to slide around, which can result in the car spinning out if the driver is not careful. The adjustment of front and rear aerodynamic downforce, spring rates, track bar geometry, brake proportioning, the wedge (also known as cross-weight), changing the camber angle, and changing the air pressure in the tires can all change the distribution of forces among the tires during cornering to correct for handling problems. Recently, coil bind setups have become popular among teams. These characteristics are also affected by tire stagger (tires of different circumference at different positions on the car, the right rear having the most influence in left turns) and rubber compounds used in tire construction. These settings are determined by NASCAR and Goodyear engineers and may not be adjusted by individual teams. Changing weather conditions may also affect a car's handling. In a long race, it is sometimes advantageous to prepare a car to handle well at the end of an event while surrendering the advantage of speed at the start. Rain forces a race to be halted immediately because there is no current provision for rain tires. While rain tires were developed for the series in the late 1990s, NASCAR abandoned them because there were not enough road courses on the schedule to justify the cost of making more tires to replace them as they aged. MENCS cars have used these tires in practice sessions, but only the Xfinity Series has used them under actual race conditions. There was, however, one case of a NASCAR Cup Series race being held in the rain. In 1956 a race at Road America was held in rain; Tim Flock won the race.MainStreetNewsSports.com \\"Flock Won Rainy Race Back in 1956\\" Retrieved 6/26/09 ===Specifications=== A typical NASCAR Cup Series engine. * Chassis: Steel tube frame with integral safety roll cage ‚Äì must meet NASCAR standards * Engine displacement: pushrod (OHV) V8 * Transmission: 4-speed manual H-pattern * Weight: minimum without driver and fuel; minimum with driver and fuel * Power output: on tracks 1 mile or below; on tracks greater than one mile (2019)https://www.nascar.com/news- media/2018/10/02/2019-rules-packages-announced-monster-energy-series/ * Torque: * Fuel: Sunoco 93 MON, 104 RON, 98 AKI 85% unleaded gasoline + Sunoco Green Ethanol E15 15% * Fuel capacity: most tracks * Fuel delivery: Port fuel injection * Fuel injection type: McLaren Electronic Systems * ECU provider: McLaren Freescale TAG-400N * Compression ratio: 12:1 * Aspiration: Naturally- aspirated * Wheelbase: * Steering: Power, recirculating ball * Tires: Slick (all tracks) and rain tires (road courses only if in case of rainy conditions) provided by Goodyear Eagle **Front and rear tire sizes: 305/711-R15 (12.0/28.0-R15) * Safety equipment: HANS device and six-point harness mandated, with seven-point harness optional ==Cup tracks== Presently, the NASCAR Cup Series is held mainly in eastern states, with only six tracks located west of the Mississippi River. Cup Series races are not conducted on standardized tracks; the 2017 season included 21 oval tracks and 3 road courses. The lap length of the oval tracks vary from at Martinsville Speedway to at Talladega Superspeedway. The majority of the oval tracks are paved with asphalt, while 3 tracks are wholly or partially paved with concrete. Although the series historically raced on dirt tracks, it has not done so since 1970. A satellite view of Charlotte Motor Speedway, a typical NASCAR track with a quad-oval configuration. The infield roval also hosts a Cup Series event, with the inaugural event in 2018. While some tracks are true ovals, such as Bristol Motor Speedway, over half the tracks currently in Cup competition are a form of tri-oval. Other configurations include Darlington Raceway's characteristic uneven \\"egg\\" shape, the triangular Pocono Raceway, and the rectangle of Indianapolis Motor Speedway. While NASCAR is known for primarily running counter-clockwise on oval tracks, Sonoma Raceway and Watkins Glen International are complex road courses which are raced clockwise. The series' first road course event was held in 1954, at Linden Airport in New Jersey. Since 1963, the series has raced on at least one road course every year. Courses have a wide range of banking in the corners. New Hampshire Motor Speedway, with 7 degrees of banking, has the flattest corners, while the steepest banking is Talladega Superspeedway's 33 degrees. Tracks also vary in amount of banking on the straightaways, from entirely flat on many courses to 9 degrees at Dover International Speedway. Bill Elliott's Melling Racing car that set the record for the fastest lap in a stock car ‚Äì , 44.998 seconds at Talladega Superspeedway. Race speeds vary widely depending on the track. The fastest track is Talladega Superspeedway, where the record average speed is and the record qualifying lap is , set by Bill Elliott in 1987. The record stands unlikely to be broken, as restrictor plates were made mandatory at superspeedways in 1988 to reduce speeds, and the plates were then replaced in 2019 by tapered spacers which still reduced enough horsepower to prevent cars from going beyonds speed of 205 mph. The slowest tracks are Sonoma Raceway, a road course with a record average speed of only and a record qualifying lap of , and Martinsville Speedway, a short, nearly flat \\"paper clip\\" oval, with a record average speed of and a record qualifying lap of . The average speed of a race is determined by dividing the winner's race time (from the waving of the green flag to the waving of the checkered flag, including laps spent under caution) by the distance of the race. Time elapsed during red flag periods is not included in the calculation of the average speed. ==See also== * Can-Am Duel * List of all-time NASCAR Cup Series winners * List of NASCAR Cup Series champions * List of NASCAR drivers * List of NASCAR race tracks * List of NASCAR teams * NASCAR Gander RV & Outdoors Truck Series * NASCAR rules and regulations * 2020 NASCAR Cup Series ==ReferencesRacing Reference Category:Recurring sporting events established in 1949 Category:Stock car racing series in the United States ","title":"NASCAR Cup Series"},{"id":"56571968","text":"Dhusha is a village Development Committee in Dhading District in the Bagmati Zone of central Nepal.

She is best known for challenging the poll tax and took her case before the United States Supreme Court. Butts was part of the civil rights movement and later became an influential member of Norfolk politics. == Early life == Evelyn Thomas was born May 22, 1924 in Norfolk, Virginia. When she was ten years old, her mother, Lottie Cornick Thomas, died and she was adopted and raised by a politically active aunt. She married Charles Herbert Butts in 1941 and her husband served in World War II. The couple had three daughters together. When Charles retired due to a war-injury, Butts worked as a seamstress and took in boarders to make money. The Butts family moved to the Oakwood neighborhood of Norfolk and Butts became the president of the neighborhood's civic league. == Civil rights activism == Butts became involved in the civil rights movement in the 1950s. During her time as the Oakwood Civic League, she helped create the Rosemont Middle School in her neighborhood so that children wouldn't have to ride the bus to the segregated school. In 1960, she was involved in picketing the Be-Lo Supermarket for not employing black people in higher-level positions. She also protested against black people being told to sit in certain parts of the football stadium. In 1961, Butts was chosen to run against the incumbent president of the Norfolk NAACP. However, Butts withdrew when it became clear she would lose. Butts and her lawyer, Joseph A. Jordan Jr., sued the state of Virginia for requiring the poll tax, filing in November of 1963. Butts' case was that the tax was unconstitutional since it imposed an \\"undue financial burden\\" that violated the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment. In March 1964, this first case was dismissed, but Butts filed another case and the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the tax. Butts appealed the case and the United States Supreme Court decided to hear the appeal in October 1965. Butts' case was combined with a similar case filed by Annie E. Harper, which reached the Supreme Court first. The case, Harper v. Virginia State Board of Elections, was decided in March of 1966, making poll taxes unconstitutional. After the Supreme Court decision, Butts went on to register black voters in Norfolk, signing up 2,882 \\"in one six month period.\\" Butts, along with Jordan and other community leaders, helped create the Concerned Citizens for Political Education group, which became a powerful political force in local politics in the 1970s. == Political career == Butts was appointed the commissioner of the Norfolk Redevelopment and Housing Authority (NRHA) in 1975. She would serve on the NRHA for twelve years. In 1982, she was appointed by the governor to the State Board of Housing and Community Development. Butts ran for city council in Norfolk three times in 1980, 1982 and in 1984, but was never successful. Also in 1984, Butts was a witness in a court trial where she supported an at-large election system in Norfolk. Butts was forced into retirement from politics in 1990 when she was ousted as the chair of the Concerned Citizens for Political Education. Butts died in her home on March 11, 1993. She is buried in Norfolk's Forest Lawn Cemetery. == Legacy == On November of 1995, Norfolk named a street in her honor. On March 27, 1996, the city held a celebration to mark the 30th anniversary of the poll tax repeal. During the celebration, they honored Butts and other activists involved. In 2017, Butts' daughter, Charlene Butts Ligon, published a book about her mother called Fearless: How a Poor Virginia Seamstress Took on Jim Crow, Beat the Poll Tax and Changed Her City Forever. The New Journal and Guide called the book \\"thoughtful and information-filled.\\" The book provides intimate details of Butts' life and her activism as seen through her daughter's eyes. == References == == External links == * Official site * State Defends Poll Tax System (1966 news clipping) * She Defeated the Poll Tax - Remembering Evelyn T.

Knight transferred to mathematics, \\"because it had fewer labs than any of the sciences\\", and graduated in 1961. She completed a master's degree in 1963 at Atlanta University, under the supervision of Abdulalim A. Shabazz, and took a teaching position at the Hampton Institute, also becoming an NSF fellow, a position that allowed her to travel and meet with other college mathematics teachers. In 1966, she returned to graduate school, and completed a doctorate in mathematics education in 1970 at the University of Maryland, College Park under the supervision of Henry H. Walbesser. Returning from her doctorate, Knight remained at the Hampton Institute, where she became chair of mathematics and computer science. In 1985 she moved to Coppin State College as a full professor. She retired in 2006. ==Recognition== In 1980, the Virginia Council of Teachers of Mathematics named Knight as their College Teacher of the Year.

They were found at the type site of Brno-Bohunice, Str√°nsk√° sk√°la (Moravia), Bacho Kiro and Temnata Cave (Bulgaria), Dzierzyslaw (Poland), and others. The Bohunician is \\"transitional\\" between the Mousterian and the Aurignacian, and thus a candidate for representing the first wave of anatomically modern humans in Europe. Its technology resembles the Mousterian Levallois technique, as do the contemporary assemblages of the Szeletian (centered on the B√ºkk Mountains of Hungary but also present in southern Poland) and the Uluzzian (Italy). Bohunician assemblages are considered similar to Emiran and Ahmarian ones and Bohunician culture may be linked to them. For this reason, it is thought likely that the Bohunician indicates the presence of anatomically modern humans, but this has not been corrobated by the discovery of any associated human remains. ==References== Category:Industries (lithics) Category:Upper Paleolithic cultures of Europe Category:Archaeology of Central Europe Category:Peopling of Europe Category:Archaeology of the Czech Republic Category:Archaeology of Eastern Europe ","title":"Bohunician"},{"id":"56572195","text":"Kelly Lynn Davis is an award-winning journalist and investigative reporter from San Diego, California. == Career == Davis helped launch San Diego CityBeat in 2002 with David Rolland and was one of the main editors. In March 2015, Davis left Southland Publishing, Inc, the publisher of San Diego CityBeat. After leaving CityBeat, Davis became a freelance writer. In May 2020, Davis joined The Appeal as a senior editor. Davis has covered California laws about sex offenders, and has investigated San Diego's homeless situation. === Inmate deaths === Davis and Dave Maass released a 5-part investigative series starting in 2013 in San Diego CityBeat about inmates dying in San Diego jails at the highest rates in the state, many of which were preventable deaths. This series won investigative awards and resulted in new policies and training to reduce suicides. In 2014, after the series had received widespread media attention, an inmate hanged himself while imprisoned and his widow sued San Diego county for negligence. In 2017, San Diego county claimed they didn't know about any problems with inmate deaths despite the widespread media coverage, and demanded that Davis provide her private investigative \\"notes, interviews and recordings\\" to help in San Diego's case against the widow. Davis refused. Many media outlets decried the request as inappropriate and a judge ordered a stay. It's been insinuated that San Diego county is trying to target or punish Davis for bringing negative media attention regarding the inmate deaths. === California right-to-die law === Davis received national attention in 2016 for an essay she wrote about Betsy, her sister, who had a \\"Rebirth Party\\" and used California's new right-to-die law to commit suicide in August 2015. == Personal life == Davis' sister Betsy committed suicide by drug in August 2015.

They were ordered by Rete Adriatica (the Adriatic Network) and were originally numbered RA 361‚Äì363. Italian railways were nationalized in 1905 and they then became FS E.361-363 They were leased to Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) in 1906 and returned to Italy in 1907. ==Overview== The locomotives were built for the Valtellina Railway, a 106 km long line with many tunnels and curves. Hungarian engineer K√°lm√°n Kand√≥ electrified the line in the early 1900s using high voltage three-phase alternating current.https://archive.is/20120712234334/http://profiles.incredible- people.com/kalman-kando/ ==Lease to SBB== The three locomotives were leased to the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) between 1906 and 1907 for the purpose of operating in the Simplon tunnel. The testing of the Simplon line was carried out on 25 January 1906 by a train pulled by a steam locomotive. On the following 26 April, the first test with an electric locomotive was carried out. The choice of the three-phase system was made by Swiss railway technicians after the visits they made to the Italian lines of the Valtellina. The Swiss had no three-phase locomotives of their own at the time so they asked for, and obtained on hire from the newly constituted Italian State Railways, the three new locomotives E.361, 362 and 363. The locomotives gave excellent service on the Simplon line, hauling over 10 trains a day. The only problem was with the current collectors. The original Ganz collectors did not collect current reliably so they were replaced by Brown-Boveri collectors. ==Return to Italy== Locomotive E.363 returned to Valtellina in May 1907 and E.361 and E.362 respectively in October and November of the same year. == See also == * RA 34, the original Bo+Bo 'gearless' locomotives supplied for the Valtellina line ==References== * ==Further reading== * Renzo Pocaterra: Lokomotiven.

He worked as a lawyer and judge and was part of the lawsuit heard before the Supreme Court of the United States that ended poll taxes. == Biography == Jordan was raised in Norfolk, Virginia. He went to the Booker T. Washington High School and went on to the Virginia Union University. In 1943, he went into the United States Army and fought overseas with the 846 Gas Company and the 67th Infantry during World War II. In September of 1945, he was injured when his jeep slid off of the highway into a mine field. The accident caused him to become paralyzed from the waist down so Jordan used a wheelchair. Jordan went on to earn a degree in sociology. He earned his law degree from Brooklyn Law School. Later, he studied labor law at New York University. In 1954, he set up a law practice in Norfolk. In 1955, when the state of Virginia planned to create a referendum to allow segregation, Jordan filed an injunction to block the vote. When Jordan and another civil rights activist, Evelyn Thomas Butts, were restrained from picketing a supermarket for not hiring black people in high level jobs, Jordan fought the restraining order, but lost. Jordan was involved in several anti-segregation cases in 1961, 1962 and 1964 in Virginia. In November of 1963, Butts hired him to sue the state for requiring a poll tax to vote. The case was dismissed by the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals in 1964. In May of 1964, Jordan and Butts filed another suit which accused the state of violating four amendments of the Constitution with the poll tax. Butts' case against the poll tax was appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States and was bundled with another case, Harper v. Virginia State Board of Elections in 1966. When the case went before the Supreme Court, Jordan argued that the poll tax laws had successfully barred black people not only from voting, but from holding office. Jordan said, \\"Almost like a magic wand after the passage of this law, these poll tax laws, not a single Negro has sat in the Virginia General Assembly, and not a single Negro has held a single elected state office in the state of Virginia.\\" The decision was made by the Supreme Court in two months and they decided that the poll tax or voting fee did violate the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. In 1968, Jordan was elected to the Norfolk City Council and became the first black person to hold the seat since 1889. In 1971, Jordan was the only black member of the city council. In 1972, he became the vice-mayor of Norfolk. In 1974, Jordan resigned as vice-mayor in protest, \\"saying the city is being run by the Norfolk Redevelopment Authority rather than City Council.\\" Jordan was appointed to the General District Court on July 1,1977. He was one of only a few African American state judges at the time. He retired from this position in 1986. Jordan died at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Hampton on June 14, 1991. A public library in Norfolk is named after Jordan. A foundation in his name, the Joe Jordan Foundation, raised funds in his name to build the Martin Luther King Jr. memorial in Norfolk. The memorial was dedicated in 2000 and had been proposed in the 70s by Jordan. == References == == External links == * Reversal of Poll Tax - 1966 news clipping and photo Category:1924 births Category:1991 deaths Category:Virginia Union University alumni Category:People from Norfolk, Virginia Category:African-American lawyers Category:African-American judges Category:Civil rights activists Category:Civil rights lawyers Category:Brooklyn Law School alumni ","title":"Joseph A.

Milne, Richard; Christer Gardell, Cevian Capital founder, on clearing out boards; Financial Times; September 10, 2017; https://www.ft.com/content/1fdd0a6c-92ed-11e7-a9e6-11d2f0ebb7f0 In 2006, Cevian launched Cevian Capital II, the largest dedicated active ownership fund in Europe. The firm invests only in Europe, although 70% of its capital comes from North America. It does not short stocks, use leverage, write open letters, or engage in proxy fights, and it believes in long-term investments. At first its investments were confined to Scandinavia; more recently, according to Zimmerman, the firm's investment focus has been \\"on the Nordics, UK, Germany and Switzerland,\\" because these countries \\"have a combination of clearest governance rules in favor of shareholders, good transparency as well as interesting companies.\\" Cevian has not invested in southern or central Europe, Zimmerman has said, \\"because we don't know those environments and we don't have relationships there, and we can't be certain that the rules, formal and informal rules, are ones that we'll be comfortable with.\\" Gardell has also stated that he and his colleagues need \\"to know the people, have networks, have a corporate governance tradition we're comfortable with\\" in order to make an investment. In 2012, at Cevian's urging, Cookson, a British engineering firm, spun off its performance materials division, increasing investment value for Cookson shareholders by over 25%. On December 16, 2018, ABB relented to pressure from Cevian and agreed to sell its poorly-performing Power Grids unit.https://www.reuters.com/article/us-abb-powergrids- hitachi/abb-relents-to-activist-shareholder-and-unloads-power-grids-unit- idUSKBN1OG06Q ==References== Category:Investment companies of Sweden ","title":"Cevian Capital"},{"id":"56572371","text":"Dallas & Robo is an American adult animation comedy web television series created by Mike Roberts and starring John Cena and Kat Dennings that premiered on May 30, 2018 on YouTube Premium.

He founded the Universal College of Regeneration in Lagos. A self- proclaimed messiah, his personal beliefs included liberal sexual rights and capital accumulation. Sect members worked in various businesses of the movement establishing a self-contained economy within the movement. ==Life== Odumosu was born in 1915 to Jacob Odumosu, his grandfather was Joseph Odumosu, a famous traditional healer in Ijebu Ode. Trained as a carpenter, he served with the Post and Telegraph Department during World War II. An active member in the postal workers union, a general strike in 1945 led to his disengagement from the department. He took on carpentry work and opened a shop on Lagos Island close to Oil Mill Street. However, he struggled as a carpenter and was constantly in debt, he was jailed for six months on charges brought by his creditors. During this period, Odumosu attended various Protestant churches in Lagos, but soon claimed he received visions and dreams from God. He interpreted some of the visions as messianic visions and that he was chosen as a messiah that has come to redeem the world. He began his rebirth by holding evening meetings close to his shop. ===Universal College of Regeneration=== Odumosu's early sermons emphasized duality of the world and self-discipline. The natural world which is filled with evil machinations, principalities and powers and a spiritual world, in which he had access. The spiritual world and natural world are in constant battle, with the former emphasized as the redeemer of the natural world. His religious movement started in 1952 at a location in Lagos Island, another major message was self-disciple; consisting of denouncing alcohol, women and tobacco. At onset, initial congregation was small, about 30 members could be counted in 1954. During this time, he instituted tithe giving to assist the poor, Odumosu also encouraged members to fund his evangelical missions. His movement began to grow and better organized, the growth assisted with a donation by a wealthy convert who provided his property for Odumosu's use. One of those properties was in Ebute Metta, where Odumosu decided to settle the movement. Since the founding of the movement, members lived at their own residences, but after the movement to Ebute Metta, Odumosu asked them to leave their houses and live in rented properties close to the church building. Members declared their wealth to Odumosu who took 10% of the tithe and charged them rent. To expand his movement, he began preaching his sermon with loudspeakers placed outside in the church hall, at a location close to Oyingbo Market, where he was sometimes derisively called 'Jesu Oyingbo'. At the new location, he began to emphasize humility and obedience, to initiate new male members, he will whip them with nine strokes of cane. In 1959, he declared himself Jesus, reduced his sermons and began to initiate various business ventures to fund a New Jerusalem. Among the ventures were Jolly Makers and Happy Day food canteens, Deluxe bakeries makers of Goodluck bread, the properties housing this venture were then expanded to include barber shops and lodging. Economy wise, the various businesses provided wages to his followers. In 1960, a schism in the church led to the exodus of most of his members.But Odumosu who had changed from preaching self-discipline to loyalty did not seem to mind, because to continue his business ventures, he needed loyal workers who will serve him. Odumosu's sexual practices were less conservative than other Christian denominations and he was said to have established sexual rights over many females within his sect. Odumosu died in 1988. ==References== Category:1915 births Category:1988 deaths Category:Religion in Nigeria ","title":"Jesu Oyingbo"},{"id":"56572375","text":"Eschatotypa derogatella is a species of moth in the family Tineidae.

In addition to Coptology and genealogy, Cannuyer also writes on the subject of Bah√° º√≠ Faith. == == US edition (left) and UK edition. Christian Cannuyer traces in five chapters the history, the rich artistic and spiritual heritage of the Egyptian Christians known as Copts in a densely illustrated, pocket-sized volume from Gallimard's \\"D√©couvertes\\" collection‚Äî‚Äîpublished in 2000, in the series. The book starts with \\"The First Church of Alexandria\\" (chap. I), from Roman times (chap. II, \\"When Egypt was Christian\\"), Islamic Egypt (chap. III, \\"Under the Sign of the Crescent\\"), Turkish conquest and the rediscovery of Coptic Christians by the West (chap. IV, \\"Crossing the Desert\\"), up to modern era (chap. V, \\"The Copts in the Modern Era\\"). The author also gives a brief explanation of the influence of ancient Egyptian culture and religion on the Copts. The \\"Documents\\" section at the back contains a compilation of excerpts which is divided into five parts: 1, Origins of the Egyptian church; 2, The Desert Fathers; 3, The echoes of ancient Egypt; 4, On earth as it is in heaven; 5, The Copts as seen by the West. In addition to the excerpts, it also features in this section a map of Coptic Egypt, a list of further reading, list of illustrations and an index. The English-language edition entitled Coptic Egypt: The Christians of the Nile, came out in 2001. This book has only been translated into English. In ancient Egypt, religion was an omnipresent phenomenon. The Romans occupied the country at about the time when Christianity was born, an extraordinary phenomenon then took place: little by little, Christ replaced the Egyptian god Osiris, and all the more easily as the Gospels report the almost four-year stay of the Holy Family in the Nile Valley. Alexandria, the great Mediterranean city, was the home to the first Christians in Egypt. According to the tradition, the Church was born here with Saint Mark the Evangelist, which later became part of the Eastern Christian Empire. Egypt even adopted Christianity as its state religion in the 4th century. Egypt at that time‚Äîespecially Alexandria‚Äîwas a real crossroads where the ancient culture of the Pharaohs, the Greek and Roman cultures, Judaic and Gnostic currents have had a strong influence on the young Christian communities. The Copts today still use in their liturgy the Coptic language, derived from the ancient Egyptian, to pray in churches and monasteries founded in the 4th century by the Desert Fathers‚ÄîAnthony, Pachomius, Paul of Thebes‚Äîand gather at festivals and pilgrimages dedicated to the Lord, the Mother of God, the saints and the martyrs.

He served as professor and Vice President of Peking University, Vice President of the Supreme People's Court, Chairman of China Zhi Gong Party (Public Interest Party), and Vice Chairperson of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). In the field of administrative law, he proposed the \\"theory of balance\\", which has become highly influential in China. == Early life in Singapore == Luo was born in March 1934 in Singapore, with his ancestral home in Anxi County, Fujian, China. His grandfather had moved to Burma and later settled in Singapore. During the Japanese occupation of Singapore, his uncle and the principal of his school were killed in the Sook Ching massacre. British rule was restored in Singapore at the end of World War II. While a 17-year-old student at The Chinese High School, Luo participated in the anti-colonial movement and was jailed by the British government for more than a year. As he had lost his birth certificate, he was deported to China in July 1952 after his release from prison. ==Academic career== In China, Luo studied at Zhiyong High School in Guangzhou and Wuxi No.1 High School in Jiangsu. He was admitted to Peking University Law School in 1956, and stayed on as a faculty member after graduating in 1960. Starting as an assistant teacher, he rose to lecturer, associate professor, professor, and eventually Vice President of Peking University. He was also Vice President of the Chinese Law Society and Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese. === Theory of balance === In the 1990s, Luo proposed the \\"theory of balance\\" in administrative law. According to Luo, the fundamental relationship in administrative law is that between the administrative power and a person or organization. In premodern times, the relationship was unequal: the authorities imposed duties on individuals. In modern capitalist societies, which have established the rule of law, administrative law aims to control the power of the authorities and protect the basic rights of individuals. Although this has been a major development in human society, Luo argued that the system sacrifices efficiency for the sake of democracy and impedes economic development. His proposed solution is a \\"theory of balance\\", which seeks to simultaneously protect and restrain both the power of the administrative organ and the rights of citizens. His theory has become highly influential in China, although it is also controversial. ==Political career== He joined the China Zhi Gong Party (Public Interest Party) in 1992, and became its vice-chairman. From 1995 to 2000, he served as Vice President of the Supreme People's Court, China's highest court. In 1997 he was elected as Chairman of the Party, and in the following year, as Vice Chairperson of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). He served in both positions for two terms (10 years). In 1999, he served as a member of the Preparatory Committee for the Handover of Macau. ==Death== Luo died in Beijing in the morning of 12 February 2018, at the age of 83. == References == == External links == *Luo Haocai profile at the Open University of China Category:1934 births Category:2018 deaths Category:Peking University alumni Category:Peking University faculty Category:Vice Chairpersons of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Category:Supreme People's Court judges Category:Singaporean emigrants to China Category:Chinese legal scholars Category:China Zhi Gong Party politicians ","title":"Luo Haocai"},{"id":"56572617","text":"Elvist Ciku (born 16 August 1986 in Shkod√´r, Albania) is an Albanian professional footballer who was last turning out for FC MAS T√°borsko in the Czech Republic. ==Early life== Getting into football at the age of six with FK Vllaznia in his home country, Ciku moved to Greece in 1997 where he joined the youth ranks of AE Peristasi, living there for nine years crediting his success as a professional footballer to his father who succored him in his rise. ==Career== Turning out for MFK Karvin√° of the Czech National Football League from 2009 to 2014, the Albanian midfielder got used to the climate there before transferring to GKS Katowice in Poland where he did not get paid for half a year despite a large fan support for the club.

In his career he worked on and helped create over 100 film projects. He produced the Academy Award nominated documentary The Living City. He wrote for a radio drama series, made experimental Bolex films, and produced the film To Live Together. == Biography == John Barnes was born on March 25, 1920 in Belford, New Jersey.New York Times, N. S. (2000, Jul 09). EDUCATIONAL FILM DIRECTOR JOHN WADSWORTH BARNES. Chicago Tribune Retrieved from https://search.proquest.com/docview/419187021 He came from a blue-collar, East Coast background of craftsmen. In elementary school Barnes had rheumatic fever that sparked a love for books and learning which was very influential on him. Another early influence was his teenage rebellion against his mother that influenced his attitude towards people he thought of as inferior intellectually and those who caused inconvenience or challenged his choices artistically and professionally. In 1939 Barnes graduated from Monmouth Junior College in Long Branch New Jersey. He later went on to attend the University of Chicago. John Barnes worked as an editor for the literary magazine of the University. He did not end up graduating. John Barnes died in the New York University Medical Center on June 27, 2000. He was 80 years old at the time of his death. == Career == Following his time at the University of Chicago, Barnes went on to pursue writing for CBS, the local radio station. One of the main projects he worked on with CBS was a short radio-drama series, featuring Ken Nordine as the host. He was fiercely protective of this films and would demand those who asked for changes to his scripts and films to defend their request before considering it. Barnes' works frequently starred notable actors such as Judi Dench, Douglass Campbell, Richard Kiley, as well as Frances Sternhagen. Barnes wrote and directed a series titled Shaw v. Shakespeare that featured George Bernard Shaw as played by actor Donald Moffat. The three part series has been accepted by many as Barnes's magnum opus. Barnes put much weight on casting actors who were excellent at their craft and even with budget constraints he avoided casting lesser actors. Barnes worked with Encyclop√¶dia Britannica for over 20 years. His immense amount of educational films remain screened, circulated, and present today. After going from making documentary film to academic, he stayed in educational film from the early 1950s and persevered into the late 1970s when educational film experienced a golden era. Educational films were typically used to ignite classroom discussions after the screening, that meant that the context, history, and complete story had to be told in a short period of time. These discussion periods, according to educational theorists, engage with students better than lectures and reading by allowing students to express their opinions and learn from speaking to each other. Later, Barnes moved away from film making and wrote plays, some were produced in the U.S. and Canada. === Encyclopaedia Britannica === In 1952 he embarked on his first project with EB Films, with Gordon Weisenborn as director and Barnes as writer and producer. People Along the Mississippi is said to be one of the first portrayals of the interaction between black and white children on film. Barnes fought against institutional censorship in southern schools which helped expand production and distribution of integrated educational films. His Oscar nominated documentary The Living City, about urban issues mainly in Chicago. Despite what Oscar nominations may allude to, those filmmakers who produced educational films made very little and relied on others to finance them so that they could continue with this career. He is known for the abundance of social themes in his films, like in the films he made for Encyclop√¶dia Britannica's 'Bill of Rights' series. Barnes continued to produce and direct iconic literary adaptations like Macbeth: The Politics of Power (1964) as well as more politically oriented works such as Equality under the Law: The Lost Generation of Prince Edward County (1966) and People along the Mississippi (1951) that have interracial themes, which was influenced by his mother's racist actions towards a teenage friend of Barnes.ALEXANDER, G.

The WNEW show was notable for being (at least in its era) the longest daily program on radio at five hours and for making WNEW the first radio station in the world to broadcast 24 hours a day. The program's novelty and impact were such that it received three pages of coverage in the October 23, 1939, issue of Life magazine. ==Background== The Biographical Encyclopedia of American Radio credits newspaper columnist Walter Winchell and WNEW general manager Bernice Judis with the creation of Milkman's Matinee. Judis's entry in the book says, \\"When authoritative columnist Walter Winchell wished (in print) for a radio station that would keep metropolitan New York's all-night work force company during the wee hours, Judis introduced the Milkman's Matinee.\\" When Stan Shaw began going on the air at 2a.m. Eastern Time, he made free entertainment available to more than 400,000 night-shift workers in the New York metropolitan area. For six nights a week, he entertained charwomen, bakers, tugboat crews, cab drivers, and others who worked through the early morning hours. Over the years, the program's schedule changed from time to time. In 1960, it was broadcast from midnight to 5:30 a.m. seven days a week. ==Format== Shaw played an average of 80 records per program with the help of an assistant. Two teleprinter machines brought in an average of 135 requests per program, with an employee from the Postal Telegraph company on hand to handle the incoming messages. As requests continued to arrive, the station increased the program's record library from its original 10,000 to 24,000 six years later. In January 1942, requests were discontinued in compliance with a wartime censorship code under which \\"Musical request shows are banned because they offer a means whereby enemy agents can send code messages.\\" Along with music, Shaw mixed in weather reports, market news, and what Life described as \\"a fresh stream of homey chatter\\". Shaw used Anson Weeks' recording, My Very Good Friend the Milkman as his opening and closing theme for each broadcast. ==Partial list of hosts== At times, Milkman's Matinee was broadcast seven nights a week. The list below includes those who had only the weekend broadcasts as well as those who had the main Monday-Friday shows. *Al Collins *John Flora *Art Ford *Charlie Jefferds *Bob Jones *Billy Kelso *Jack Lazare *Jack Lescoulie *Ed Locke *Stan Martin *Phil McLean *Dick Partridge *Maryann Roque *Stan Shaw *Dick Shepard *Bill St. James *Jim Tate *Marty Wilson ==Popularity and revenue== In 1949, a survey conducted by the Pulse, Inc., rating service found that Milkman's Matinee was the top-rated post-midnight radio program in the metropolitan New York area. A 1955 Pulse survey showed that the program had more than three times the number of listeners of its closest competitor. In 1960, officials at WNEW said ratings for Milkman's Matinee were 20 percent higher than those of its closest competitor. That was the program's 25th year, and the station's general manager said advertising sales over that span were estimated at $2.5 million. As time went on, the all- night concept had spread to other radio stations, including WPEN in Philadelphia and WBGE in Atlanta. In 1941, a radio columnist for the Brooklyn Eagle wrote that more than 20 stations \\"have copied the idea\\". ==Transatlantic transmission== On August 15, 1947, two apparently unprecedented events occurred on Milkman's Matinee. Art Ford broadcast via shortwave radio from studios of the British Broadcasting Corporation in London, England, as part of a salute to the musical Oklahoma!. Besides being the first transatlantic disc jockey broadcast, the show also featured the first broadcast of a radio duet between two continents, as Mary Hatcher in New York and Howard Keel in London sang People Will Say We're in Love. Composer Richard Rodgers and librettist Oscar Hammerstein II were also on hand in the studio with Ford. ==Recent years== In 2013, Metromedia Radio initiated an automated version of Milkman's Matinee that was syndicated to radio stations in the United States and 60 other countries. ==References== ==External links== * Milkman's Matinee sung by The Modernaires, from YouTube Category:1935 radio programme debuts Category:1930s American radio programs Category:1940s American radio programs Category:1950s American radio programs Category:1960s American radio programs Category:American music radio programs ","title":"Milkman's Matinee"},{"id":"56572798","text":"Eschatotypa melichrysa is a species of moth in the family Tineidae.

He is portrayed as a French teenage student that has been homeschooled for most of his life and is also a model for his father, Gabriel Agreste, a famous fashion designer with whom Adrien has a distant relationship. After passing the test of Master Fu, who is later revealed as the keeper of the magical objects called the Miraculouses, by helping him, Adrien is chosen as one of the two soon-to-be superheroes alongside Ladybug, for whom he quickly develops feelings and whose secret civilian identity is Marinette Dupain-Cheng. Consequently, Adrien receives a ring named the Cat Miraculous, which when worn grants him the ability to transform into his superhero alias, Cat Noir (). Cat Noir and Ladybug's aim is to protect Paris from the villain Hawk Moth. Every Miraculous is accompanied by a small magical creature known as a kwami, with Adrien's kwami being Plagg, a black cat-like being. As Cat Noir, Adrien's signature ability is destruction. Adrien appears in most Miraculous media, including the main series, the comic books, and the mobile running game. Adrien was conceptualized as a character who would appeal to everyone, having many good characteristics and being able to inspire the viewers. Regarding Adrien's superhero identity, since Ladybug's power was connected to good luck, Astruc concluded that her partner would have powers related to bad luck, which resulted in him thinking of a black cat. Cat Noir was also inspired by the comic book superhero Catwoman. Adrien is voiced by Bryce Papenbrook in the English dub, while Benjamin Bollen voices him in the show's French version. Critical reception of Adrien has been generally positive, with writers describing him as a great, interesting, and relatable character. His relationship with Marinette has been praised, both when they are depicted as civilians and as superheroes (but so far it is known that off camera he has a stable relationship for more than 2 years with the actrees Chlo√© Bourgeois). Adrien has served as inspiration for cosplays. Merchandise inspired by him has been produced, such as action figures, accessories, and clothing items. ==Development== ===Concept and creation=== alt=The appearance of Adrien Agreste's superhero form Adrien Agreste was conceptualized as a \\"modern\\" Prince Charming, \\"with many good human qualities\\" and \\"a feminine part\\"; Thomas Astruc, the creator of the animated television series Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug & Cat Noir, described these characteristics as \\"a perfect combo\\", adding that Adrien is \\"a really nice character\\". He also characterized Adrien as \\"handsome, smart, brave, but also very sensitive\\", and as someone that \\"everybody would naturally fall in love with\\". When asked how Adrien and Marinette Dupain-Cheng had been developed, Astruc commented that he had wanted to \\"present sunny characters who could inspire people all around the world in this new century\\". Astruc stated that since ladybugs are associated with good luck, he had decided that Ladybug's partner would have powers connected to bad luck, and as a result he had thought of a black cat. The creation of Cat Noir () was also a tribute to Catwoman. Astruc commented that Cat Noir's civilian identity had initially been a character named F√©lix, describing him as \\"an early love interest for Marinette\\" who would have had a distant attitude toward her and would have been included in the \\"typical cold-and-snobbish-guy anime trope\\". He said that while the difference between F√©lix and Cat Noir's personalities would have worked positively, it would not have provided very good narratives in the long term. Because of this, F√©lix was replaced with Adrien. Astruc stated that Cat Noir is one of the two most \\"powerful teenagers\\" alongside Ladybug since he has the power of destruction. The idea related to the duo of the black cat and the ladybug was also inspired by one of Astruc's previous romantic relationships. Astruc said that managing the situation created by Cat Noir's two identities alongside Ladybug's two selves in terms of romance was \\"a lot of fun\\". He stated that pairs of superheroes like the one Cat Noir forms with Ladybug are rare in television series, adding that people enjoy the love game between the two characters. Astruc commented that a romantic relationship between Adrien and Marinette would be fragile and intricate as long as there was a villain in the series; he said that such a relationship would need to be handled carefully and would be able to happen only under certain circumstances. Cat Noir's chibi form appearing in the series Miraculous Chibi was created by character designer Angie Nasca while the show \\"was still in the development phase\\"; according to Nasca, \\"the series grew from those initial sketches\\" portraying the two lead characters. Jeremy Zag, the producer of Miraculous, stated that the love situation Adrien created alongside Marinette, their superhero alter egos, and their secrets are some of the main parts of the show. S√©bastien Thibaudeau, the writing director of Miraculous, mentioned that Adrien frequently makes him emotional because of his difficult life. He said Cat Noir is the character that brings humor into the story, contrasting with Ladybug, who is more serious. Thibaudeau stated that Adrien can express himself when he is transformed into Cat Noir. Fred Lenoir, a writer of the series, commented that Adrien's relationship with Marinette, depicted as both civilians and superheroes, and the misunderstanding resulted from it represent the central part of the story. Andr√© Lake Mayer, ZAG America's president of global consumer products, stated that Cat Noir is one of children's preferred \\"relatable heroes\\"; she felt that the fans would \\"love taking on\\" Cat Noir's persona in the Miraculous mobile running game. Nicole D'Andria, who contributed to the writing of a Miraculous comic book, described Cat Noir as a \\"fantastic\\" character \\"that everyone can look up to\\". Giulia Adragna, the creator of an Italian Miraculous comic book series, said that she had liked Cat Noir the most after seeing images from the series for the first time, commending that he looked like a male version of Catwoman. Adragna stated that Adrien, both in his superhero form and as his civilian self, is her favorite Miraculous character. She commented that while Adrien could have been a typically unlikable character since he comes from a fine family and is a model, he instead is depicted as innocent, caring, and kind. ===Voice=== alt=Adrien Agreste's English voice actor, Bryce Papenbrook Bryce Papenbrook voices Adrien in the English dub of the series. Papenbrook said that it is \\"always great to be Cat Noir\\", stating that he had \\"so much fun\\" with him. He described Miraculous as \\"a great show\\" with \\"fun animation and a lot of puns\\". He felt that the show's English dub contains the most puns out of all versions of the series. Papenbrook stated that he enjoys \\"making those cheesy puns\\", and he commented that he was \\"sneaking as many cat puns as possible into the show\\", feeling that the viewers like them. Papenbrook said he loves Miraculous, mentioning that he knew \\"a ton of people [had] been waiting for that show\\". He described the second season of the series as \\"really, really good\\". He stated that he was \\"very excited\\" since Miraculous had won a Teen Choice Award. Papenbrook commented that he was \\"excited to see more bad guys\\" in the next seasons of the series, stating that the writers are \\"creative\\" with the people depicted in the show. He felt that the Miraculous Chibi series is \\"exciting\\" and \\"looks really cool\\". When the casting for the show began, many voice actors auditioned for the roles of the main characters, including Adrien's. Ezra Weisz, the voice director of Miraculous, said the staff responsible for the casting had wanted Adrien's voice to sound young and to denote self-assurance in his superhero form without making him seem overly proud; he further commented that the staff had wished to find an actor whose voice could separate Adrien's civilian self from his superhero identity. According to Weisz, he and Papenbrook had known each other for a long time. When the staff was trying to find a fitting voice for Adrien, Weisz felt that Papenbrook would be very suited for it. He stated that Papenbrook's voice sounds \\"the right age\\", adding that he has \\"the right acting abilities\\" for this role and \\"is very, very skilled in the booth\\". Weisz said that Papenbrook does \\"a phenomenal job\\" on voicing Adrien. Jared Wolfson, the executive producer of Miraculous, commented that Papenbrook has a lot of \\"energy\\" and characterized him as \\"a great guy\\". He further described him as \\"very happy\\", \\"personable\\", and \\"energetic\\", stating that Papenbrook \\"loves what he does\\" and is \\"very passionate\\" about \\"being Adrien and Cat Noir\\". Cristina Vee, the voice actress of Marinette, felt that Papenbrook is \\"one of the nicest people\\", characterizing him as \\"never down\\" and \\"really positive\\". She also described him as \\"a really talented actor\\" and enjoyed working alongside him. Benjamin Bollen voices Adrien in the French version of the show. Thomas Astruc characterized the French cast of the series, including Bollen, as fantastic. ==Appearances== ===In the main series=== Adrien is a protagonist of the Miraculous series. He is depicted as a French teenage student living in Paris, who comes from a wealthy family. He is the son of Emilie and Gabriel Agreste. His father is a renowned fashion designer for whom Adrien acts as a model, which grants him popularity. Meanwhile, his mother has disappeared. Adrien is taken care of by Gabriel's assistant, Nathalie Sancoeur, and he has a bodyguard as well. Adrien also has a maternal aunt named Am√©lie and a maternal cousin called F√©lix. Even though he has been homeschooled for most of his life, one day Adrien decides to start attending school. While heading toward its entrance, he notices an elderly man in need of assistance and offers to help him. Unknown to Adrien at the time, the man is Master Fu, the keeper of the magical objects named the Miraculouses, and this has been just a test to show who would deserve to become a superhero. Because of Adrien's kind gesture, Master Fu decides to give him a ring called the Cat Miraculous. After realizing he is in possession of the box that contains the ring, Adrien opens it and suddenly a black cat-like creature who presents himself as Plagg appears; he is a magical being known as a kwami. When wearing the ring, Adrien can transform into a superhero with the help of Plagg's powers. Adrien is eager to transform and immediately does so. His superhero outfit derives from Plagg's appearance, representing a black cat. Not long after he transforms for the first time, he meets his new superhero partner, Ladybug, with whom he rapidly falls in love. During their first meeting, Adrien introduces his superhero alias, Cat Noir. Unknown to him, Ladybug is Marinette, one of Adrien's classmates who has a big crush on him. At the same time, Adrien only has feelings for Ladybug, while Marinette as Ladybug does not appreciate Cat Noir's advances toward her. Cat Noir and Ladybug's purpose is to protect Paris from a man known as Hawk Moth, who can transform people into supervillains. Hawk Moth wishes to obtain Cat Noir's and Ladybug's Miraculouses, and he is actually Adrien's father without them being aware of this. When he is Cat Noir, Adrien becomes more uninhibited and flirtatious compared to his self- restrained and modest usual personality, and he makes a lot of cat-themed puns. This transformation grants him new abilities. Cat Noir's signature power is destruction, called \\"Cataclysm\\". His superhero weapon is an extendable staff. Adrien has a distant relationship with his father, and he acts in a way that meets his father's expectations despite not being able to express himself because of this. He has a varying relationship with Plagg, but the two of them care about each other. Adrien has a generally positive relationship with his classmates, especially with Nino Lahiffe, his best friend. He also has a close relationship with Kagami Tsurugi, one of the students from the fencing lessons that he attends. Adrien has a childhood friend, Chlo√© Bourgeois, of whose usual behavior he does not approve. ===In other Miraculous media=== Outside the main series, Adrien is present in most Miraculous media. He appears in the Christmas special episode, which consists of a musical format; in this episode, he spends his first Christmas without his mother. Adrien is present in the special episode that takes place in New York City, and he will appear in the special episode set in Shanghai as well. Adrien is also present in the Miraculous Secrets episodes, in the Tales from Paris episodes, and in the chibi episodes. He has been part of a video clip meant to encourage proper hygiene among children. Adrien has appeared under his superhero identity in several sequences where he has addressed to the viewers in a direct manner. Adrien is present in comic books based on the show; he also appears in other types of books inspired by the series. He is depicted in the official magazine of the series as well. Adrien is a playable character in the Miraculous mobile running game. He is portrayed in live stage shows, including one that has been on tour. Adrien will be present in a 2D OVA. He had also been announced to appear in a Miraculous live action film, but the film was subsequently changed to an animated musical film, titled Ladybug & Cat Noir Awakening. ==Reception== ===Critical response=== Adrien's character has received a generally positive critical response, with writers characterizing him as an \\"iconic\\", \\"great\\", beautiful, \\"relatable\\", and \\"beyond famous\\" character. ComicsVerses Michele Kirichanskaya said that Adrien's \\"character is essential to the overall charm captured by the show\\". She praised that Cat Noir had been inspired by an existent superhero, Catwoman. Kirichanskaya stated that Cat Noir had been created following the \\"superhero logic\\", on account of which heroes wearing masks \\"must combat superpowered foes\\". She wrote that because of Cat Noir's \\"transformation scene\\", the \\"Magical Girl trope\\" present in the story is \\"not limited by gender\\". Robert Lloyd of Los Angeles Times characterized Adrien as \\"an unspoiled rich kid who moonlights as a model\\". He stated that \\"the male hero wears a catsuit, cat ears and a sort of tail\\", which \\"may seem a surprisingly foreign and/or feminine touch\\" to the American audience. Le Figaros Damien Mercereau described Adrien as a sensitive and unassuming character, commenting that he becomes resourceful and self-assured as Cat Noir. ComicsAlliance writer Elle Collins praised that Cat Noir's costume \\"makes him look like Selina Kyle's boy sidekick\\". She said many people have \\"the false belief that superheroes are for boys\\", deeming it predictable that Cat Noir was publicized as Ladybug's \\"equal co-star of the show\\" although the initial title of the series had highlighted \\"the female character as the real star, with Cat Noir as her fellow costumed hero and possible love interest\\". Collins stated that she was \\"interested to see\\" whether Cat Noir had \\"a Magical Girl transformation\\" similar to Ladybug's. Emily Ashby of Common Sense Media characterized Adrien in his civilian form as a normal child \\"facing typical tween troubles\\", such as \\"keeping up with school, making friends, and dealing with difficult peers\\". Comic Book Resources writer Nathan Dodge described Cat Noir as \\"a stylish cat-themed hero\\". Emily Auten of Nerd Much? praised Bryce Papenbrook's voice acting, stating that Adrien's voice is done \\"especially well\\" along with Marinette's and viewing this as \\"definitely a plus since the entire plot focuses on them\\". She said that Adrien's character is \\"very interesting\\", \\"especially in contrast with\\" his superhero identity, and wrote that Adrien is a \\"great\\" choice for a protagonist \\"even without the romantic subplot\\". Auten characterized Cat Noir as one of the \\"best\\" parts of the series, and she stated that his \\"lengthy transformation\\" sequence never seems overly extended and is \\"fun to see\\". An El Intransigente writer said Adrien's character shows that money does not buy happiness. Adrien was commented to \\"teach kids about confidence\\", and he was regarded as \\"cute and fun to watch\\". He was deemed \\"mild-mannered\\", and \\"shy\\". Cat Noir was described as loyal, and as Ladybug's \\"sidekick\\". When an episode depicted him in a stadium, Cat Noir was stated to win alongside Ladybug against his opponent as easily as the professional football club Paris Saint-Germain F.C. did in the Ligue 1 French championship. Adrien's relationship with Marinette has been praised, both as civilians and as superheroes. Cat Noir's interactions with Ladybug have been commended, being regarded as \\"absolutely adorable to watch\\". Michele Kirichanskaya characterized Adrien as Marinette's \\"crime-fighting partner\\" and described the \\"dynamics\\" between the two of them as \\"captivating\\". She said Adrien's \\"romantic dynamic\\" with Marinette \\"contributes much\\" to the show's \\"drama and comedy\\", adding that the series \\"creates a love quadrangle by only using two individuals\\". Emily Ashby stated that Cat Noir makes \\"a charming crime-fighting duo\\" with Ladybug and said \\"their relationship easily eclipses the show's action in entertainment value\\". She felt that watching Adrien's relationship with Marinette evolve is \\"fun\\". Ashby stated that the viewers \\"have to forgive the characters' naivety\\" and accept \\"that merely an eye mask and some cat ears\\" prevent Adrien and Marinette from recognizing one another. She said that Cat Noir's crush on Ladybug \\"is a sweet example of young love\\". Mar√≠a Merino of Okdiario commented that Adrien's relationship with Marinette is one of the factors that attract viewers to this series. Emily Auten thought that the \\"romantic subplot\\" is made \\"even more interesting\\" by Cat Noir's crush on Ladybug, with \\"the chemistry between both of them being one of the many highlights\\" in the show. She wrote that Cat Noir forms alongside Ladybug \\"one of the best duos\\" she had ever seen in a cartoon. The love situation Adrien created alongside Marinette was stated to bring \\"a fun dynamic\\" into the series, and was regarded as sweet; it was described as one of the \\"old clich√©s on the genre\\", and was viewed as similar to \\"the classic Clark-Lois-Superman triangle\\". ===Popularity and merchandise=== Paul Marciano, the chairman and chief creative officer of Guess, said that the viewers' understanding of Adrien's relationship with Marinette and their superhero alter egos make this series \\"intriguing\\". A life-size wax statue portraying Cat Noir has been displayed at the Mus√©e Gr√©vin. He has been depicted on buses and billboards. A Snapchat filter inspired by Cat Noir has been developed. Cosplays of Adrien have been created, both as his civilian self, and under his superhero identity. Meet-and-greet sessions containing Cat Noir have taken place, including at a theme park. He has served as inspiration for face painting, for indoor playgrounds, and for a Christmas event. Several pieces of merchandise based on Adrien's civilian and superhero forms have been produced, such as action figures. Toys inspired by him have been created, including Kinder Surprise toys. Figurines depicting Cat Noir have been launched by Burger King, and by Funko. Pez candy dispensers portraying him have been developed. Clothing items and accessories based on Adrien have been produced. Stickers inspired by him have been created. Masks based on Cat Noir have been released. Items depicting Cat Noir alongside Ladybug have been launched, such as school-related items, and beach-related items. Sweets inspired by him have been invented. A game based on Cat Noir and other Miraculous characters has been developed. Other products inspired by him have also been created. ==References== Category:Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug & Cat Noir characters Category:Animated human characters Category:Child characters in animated series Category:Child superheroes Category:Fictional characters with superhuman senses Category:Fictional flexible weapons practitioners Category:Fictional models Category:Fictional people from Paris Category:Fictional traceurs and freerunners Category:French superheroes Category:Magical girl characters Category:Male characters in animated series Category:Male superheroes Category:Superheroes with alter egos Category:Teenage characters in television Category:Television characters introduced in 2015 Category:Television superheroes ","title":"Adrien Agreste"},{"id":"56572918","text":"Marinette Dupain-Cheng is a fictional character and a protagonist of the animated television series Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug & Cat Noir created by Thomas Astruc. She is depicted as a French-Chinese teenage student that aspires to become a fashion designer and whose parents own a bakery. After she passes the test of Master Fu, the keeper of the magical objects named the Miraculouses, by helping him, Marinette is chosen as a future superhero alongside Cat Noir. As a result, she is given a pair of earrings known as the Ladybug Miraculous, which when worn grants Marinette the ability to transform into Ladybug, her superhero alias. Ladybug and Cat Noir's goal is to protect Paris from the villain Hawk Moth. Unknown to Marinette, Cat Noir's civilian identity is Adrien Agreste, a classmate whom she has feelings for. As the holder of a Miraculous, Marinette is assisted by a small red creature resembling a ladybug called Tikki, who is a magical being known as a kwami. As Ladybug, Marinette's signature ability is creation. Marinette appears in most Miraculous media, including the main series, the mobile running game, and the comic books. Marinette's character was inspired by a young woman wearing a ladybug-themed T-shirt who once worked with Astruc. After creating a drawing that portrayed her as a ladybug-themed superhero, Astruc felt this would be a good character, especially as he was not aware of the existence of another ladybug-related superhero. The woman's haircut served as inspiration for Marinette's hairstyle as well. Marinette is voiced by Cristina Vee in the English dub, while Anouck Hautbois voices her in the French version of the series. Marinette's character has received a generally positive critical response, with writers characterizing her as a role model for viewers and as a great protagonist; both her civilian self and her superhero identity have been praised. Meet-and-greet sessions containing Ladybug have taken place. Several pieces of merchandise based on her, such as accessories, clothing items, and action figures, have been created. ==Development== ===Concept and creation=== alt=Marinette Dupain-Cheng under her superhero identity The superhero identity of Marinette Dupain-Cheng, Ladybug, was inspired by a young woman wearing a T-shirt with a ladybug depicted on it; she belonged to the production team of another show that also included Thomas Astruc, the creator of the animated television series Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug & Cat Noir. Astruc stated that he had befriended her, and following this they had started creating and \\"exchanging ladybug-themed sticky notes\\"; a note drawn by Astruc portrayed the woman as a ladybug-themed superhero. Astruc did not know of the existence of a ladybug-related superhero and felt this character would be good. As a result, Ladybug's character was conceptualized. Astruc thought that a superhero based on this idea had not previously been created because of not being sufficiently masculine. Marinette's hairstyle was also conceived using the woman's haircut as a model. Astruc said that Ladybug's power was connected to luck since ladybugs are associated with good luck. He commented that Ladybug's character is comparable to Spider-Man. Astruc stated that while Marinette is a girl of action, this does not prevent her from wearing pink. He characterized Ladybug as an \\"awesome\\", special, very positive, and bright character. He also described her as his favorite character from the series. Astruc hoped that children would view Ladybug as a positive example, and that she would become the mascot of Paris, being found on flyers at museums' entrances to inspire children to visit them. In regard to Marinette and Adrien Agreste, he commented that he had wished to depict \\"sunny\\", inspiring characters. Astruc mentioned that Ladybug is one of the two most \\"powerful teenagers\\" alongside Cat Noir since she has the power of creation. He stated that handling the dynamics between Marinette's and Adrien's identities was entertaining. Astruc said that couples of superheroes like the one consisting of Ladybug and Cat Noir are uncommon in shows, and he felt that the viewers enjoy the love situation formed between the two of them. A source of inspiration for the duo of the ladybug and the black cat was one of Astruc's previous romantic relationships. Astruc stated that, as long there was a villain in the show, a romantic relationship between Marinette and Adrien would be able to happen only under certain circumstances and would need to be handled carefully, commenting that such a relationship would be brittle and complicated. Ladybug's costume was difficult to animate when it came to the show's original 2D version since it was red with black dots; the dots had to be in certain places and had to remain unmoved. In the 3D version, this problem disappeared since there was a model moving. In the 2D version, Marinette was supposed to be older than she currently is in the 3D version. The chibi design of Ladybug from the series Miraculous Chibi was conceived by character designer Angie Nasca. The bakery of Marinette's family was inspired by a real-life Parisian bakery. Astruc commented that deciding on how Ladybug would use a certain item created with the help of her Miraculous to defeat the villain takes a quarter of the writers' working time for an episode; S√©bastien Thibaudeau, the writing director of Miraculous, stated that Ladybug is intelligent since she manages to do what in reality several people can think of only when collaborating with each other. According to Thibaudeau, the writers wanted Marinette to not be based on clich√©s and to resemble a contemporary girl, able to create things and desiring to achieve something in life; they also wished Marinette's transformation into a self-assured superhero to show that people can change and become stronger. Marinette is also meant to highlight that one has to fight and be open-minded and smart in order to be successful in life. Thibaudeau said Marinette tries to improve Adrien's difficult life. Fred Lenoir, also writing for Miraculous, stated that Marinette's relationship with Adrien, both as civilians and as superheroes, is the main part of the show. Astruc mentioned that the third season of the series served as a test for Marinette; M√©lanie Duval, another writer of Miraculous, commented that Marinette had a lot of obstacles to overcome in that season. Jeremy Zag, the president of the animation studio Zagtoon, described Marinette as \\"a fresh and modern girl character who is in line with kids' and teens' lives today\\". The first two images depicting Ladybug released by Zag, one showing her portrait and one featuring her on a rooftop in Paris, received enough attention to surround the world. Zag said the love situation that Marinette created alongside Adrien, their superhero identities, and their secrets represent some of the main parts of the story. Jared Wolfson, the executive producer of Miraculous, stated that the audience of girls had been waiting for \\"someone like a Spider-Man to come along\\" and that, because of Ladybug's character, they can now transform into her, becoming \\"stronger\\" and making \\"an effect in the world\\". With regard to Ladybug's character, Aton Soumache, the chief executive officer of the company Method Animation, said the producers had wished to \\"create a [glamorous] superhero character with a real European flair with Paris as backdrop\\", as a result of the previous lack of an action series centered on a female superhero. Nicole D'Andria, a contributor to the creation of a Miraculous comic book, said that Ladybug is an admirable character. ZAG America's president of global consumer products, Andr√© Lake Mayer, stated that children are fond of Ladybug's character, and that the fans would enjoy playing as Ladybug in the Miraculous mobile running game. She felt that Ladybug \\"is instantaneously empowering to all women, all ages\\", saying that she \\"is mesmerizing both as Marinette and as Ladybug\\". Mayer stated that \\"even without knowing the story\\", \\"she is instinctively familiar, authentic and strong\\", adding that \\"Ladybug is an icon for wholesome girl empowerment\\". She also characterized Ladybug as \\"relatable\\", and as \\"unique\\". ===Voice=== alt=Marinette Dupain-Cheng's English voice actress, Cristina Vee Cristina Vee voices Marinette in the English dub. Vee stated that she loves Marinette, describing her as one of her favorite characters that she voiced. She said Marinette reminds her of the character Sailor Moon, commenting that \\"working on the show\\" had given her \\"the same feelings\\" as the ones she had experienced while \\"watching Sailor Moon growing up as a kid\\". She stated that she had auditioned for Marinette's role considerably, most likely more than she had previously done for other characters. Vee said she had first obtained the script for the audition around a year before being cast, adding that she had not received a reply after auditioning. Following this, she had acquired the script once again, and after the audition, she received two callbacks. She stated that ever since she had seen Marinette's character design and the script, she had known that \\"whoever was cast as this character, Ladybug, would be the luckiest girl\\", precisely \\"the luckiest voice actress\\". After reading the script for the first time, Vee felt that Marinette was a version \\"on paper\\" of herself. Vee said she had fallen in love with Ladybug immediately. She commented that she had not been aware of this show's existence before auditioning for Marinette's role, which surprised her since she kept herself up to date with anime-related news. After auditioning and before receiving the callbacks, she found out about the anime promotional video of the series. After seeing the video, she started wanting the role all the more. Vee said that she resembles Marinette very much, sometimes being \\"pretty shy and clumsy\\" and stumbling over her \\"words and feet\\". While she liked that Marinette is affectionate toward Adrien and \\"mixes up her words sometimes\\", Vee regarded \\"fighting crime as Ladybug\\" as \\"her favorite part\\" of voicing her, stating that she enjoyed the moments when Marinette says her specific phrases for her transformation into Ladybug and for using her signature superhero ability. She mentioned that Marinette and Adrien learning about each other's identities would be \\"exciting\\", adding that she wished to see how they would \\"work together in a different way to fight crime\\". Vee characterized this show as \\"amazing\\", stating that she had never seen an animation like this before and that \\"every episode is just so beautiful\\". She described the second season of the series as \\"awesome\\". Regarding the Christmas special episode, Vee hoped it would contain moments centered on Marinette and Adrien. Many voice actors auditioned for the roles of the main characters, including Marinette's, when the casting for the series started. Ezra Weisz, the voice director of Miraculous, said that the staff in charge of the casting had wished Marinette to sound confident yet not excessively proud as a superhero, and they had wanted to find someone whose voice would be able to distinguish Marinette's civilian identity from her superhero self. Weisz mentioned that Vee does a remarkable job on voicing Marinette. He stated that Vee \\"has a young heroine quality to her voice\\", adding that he had always wished Vee \\"to be an actual superhero\\" since he felt she is a superhero \\"in real life\\". Weisz commented that Vee portrays the idea of a nervous teenager who becomes embarrassed around the person they love very well. He said that when Vee \\"transforms into Ladybug, she gets to put on her confidence\\", stating that this is precisely what she emanates in the vocal booth. Jared Wolfson mentioned that Vee is energetic. He said she has a \\"beautiful personality\\", describing her as \\"so sweet\\", \\"so kind\\", and \\"great\\". He stated that in the recording studio, Vee \\"goes from sweet Marinette to Ladybug\\", adding that \\"she is Ladybug in that room\\" and that this is \\"so fun to watch\\". Anouck Hautbois voices Marinette in the French version of the series. Thomas Astruc regarded Hautbois and the rest of the French cast as fantastic. ==Appearances== ===In the main series=== Marinette is a protagonist of the Miraculous series. She is portrayed as a French-Chinese teenage student from Paris, who wishes to become a fashion designer. Marinette is the daughter of Tom Dupain and Sabine Cheng, granddaughter of Rolland and Gina Dupain, and grandniece of Wang Cheng. Her parents own a bakery. One day, when rushing toward school, Marinette notices an elderly man in danger and immediately saves him. While Marinette is not aware of this at the time, the man is Master Fu, the keeper of the magical objects called the Miraculouses, who has prepared a test in order to find someone deserving of becoming a superhero. Since Marinette has saved him, Master Fu decides to offer her the Ladybug Miraculous, which is a pair of earrings. After Marinette sees the box that contains the earrings and opens it, a creature resembling a ladybug who presents herself as Tikki appears; she is a magical being known as a kwami, who grants Marinette the power to transform into a superhero when wearing the earrings. When she sees Tikki for the first time, Marinette is afraid of her. She is also not thrilled by the idea of becoming a superhero, and the first time she transforms is by mistake. Nevertheless, she learns how to act as a superhero shortly after that and introduces her superhero alias, Ladybug. Marinette's superhero outfit derives from Tikki's appearance, resembling a ladybug. Marinette is in love with Adrien, a boy from her class whom she gets nervous around. Unknown to Marinette, Adrien is actually her superhero partner, Cat Noir, who fancies Ladybug. Since Marinette is not aware of Cat Noir's civilian identity, she constantly rejects his advances toward her. Ladybug and Cat Noir's objective is to protect Paris from Hawk Moth, a man who has the ability to turn people into supervillains; he wishes to acquire Ladybug's and Cat Noir's Miraculouses, and, unknown to them, is actually Adrien's father. As Ladybug, Marinette becomes more sure of herself. The transformation into Ladybug offers her new abilities. Her signature power is creation, named \\"Lucky Charm\\". Ladybug's superhero weapon is a yo-yo. Marinette has a loving relationship with her parents, and a close bond with Tikki. She also has a mainly positive relationship with her classmates, particularly with her best friend, Alya C√©saire; Alya often offers support to Marinette and is there for her when she needs help, and she is a big fan of Ladybug. Marinette also has a close relationship with Luka Couffaine, the older brother of one of her classmates, and a friendly relationship with Nino Lahiffe, who once had a crush on her. At the same time, Marinette does not get along with Chlo√© Bourgeois, nor with Lila Rossi, both of whom have tried to put Marinette in difficult situations on many occasions. ===In other Miraculous media=== Besides the main series, Marinette appears in most Miraculous media. She is present in the Christmas special episode, which consists of a musical format. Marinette appears in the special episode set in New York City, and she will also be present in the special episode that takes place in Shanghai. She has been featured in the chibi episodes, in the Tales from Paris episodes, and in the Miraculous Secrets episodes.

Emily Ashby of Common Sense Media characterized Marinette as \\"patient\\" and \\"kind\\". ComicsVerse writer Michele Kirichanskaya felt that the series \\"takes the time to address Marinette's heritage\\" in \\"a subtle and respectful manner\\", citing the \\"moments when she struggles with speaking Chinese\\" and has \\"cultural miscommunications with relatives\\". Kirichanskaya wrote that Marinette's complete name when \\"translated from both Chinese and French languages\\" is \\"appropriate for a girl whose family owns a bakery\\". She described Marinette as \\"loyal and devoted to her friends and family\\". Kirichanskaya said Marinette being \\"an aspiring fashion designer\\" who makes \\"new creations in her spare time\\" shows that \\"feminine interests [do not] necessarily detract from superheroic qualities\\", deeming this \\"a positive message for male and female viewers alike\\". She thought that the feelings Marinette has for Adrien \\"only define one aspect of her character\\". Caroline Gourdin of La Libre Belgique stated that Marinette's character is one of the main aspects of the series, adding that she can appeal to both girls and boys. Nerd Much? writer Emily Auten felt that \\"Marinette's shoujo-like crush on Adrien\\" is one of the \\"small aspects that anime fans can appreciate\\" in this show. Auten wrote that \\"Marinette takes center stage\\" as a protagonist despite the lack of heroines in television series; she also stated that \\"Marinette is a great female protagonist\\". Auten said Marinette is \\"very well-written\\", stating that she is \\"a great role model\\" for both children and adults \\"to look up to and relate with\\". She praised Cristina Vee's role as Marinette's voice actress. An El Intransigente writer said that the applauded protagonist of this series is a girl, unlike how it happens in other shows, and that Marinette has a big heart. Marinette was commented to have \\"innocent optimism\\". She was described as a very important character for children from many countries, including France. Marinette's superhero form, Ladybug, has been commended. Elle Collins of ComicsAlliance said the way \\"Marinette transforms into Ladybug in a series of twirls and poses\\" resembles how \\"Sailor Moon and other magical girls always do\\". She felt that Marinette having \\"the guidance of some kind of talking ladybug creature\\" completes \\"another Magical Girl trope\\". Los Angeles Times writer Robert Lloyd commented that Marinette is a \\"smart girl\\" and characterized her superhero form as \\"a costumed crusader\\". Michele Kirichanskaya stated that while Marinette initially \\"appears to be just an ordinary girl\\", with the help of \\"a pair of magical earrings\\" she \\"can transform into the Miraculous Ladybug, one of Paris's greatest superheroes\\". She described Marinette as \\"a bright, talented, creative young woman, trying to balance her daily life with all the responsibilities that entail being France's greatest superheroine\\". Kirichanskaya characterized Ladybug as \\"an incredible hero\\" who is \\"fluid and confident in battle\\". She felt that \\"Marinette embodies the most\\" of both her ordinary and superhero lives \\"in a beautiful force of a character\\". Laura Aasland of Culture Honey praised that while Ladybug keeps \\"groaning at Cat Noir's puns\\", Marinette has feelings for Adrien. Ella Anders of BSCkids said that while \\"from a glance [Marinette] appears to be a typical high-school teen\\", she is \\"a champion of right\\" in reality. Epicstreams Caitlin Donovan described Marinette as \\"an adorable lead who is genuinely awkward as a civilian\\" yet \\"confident as a superhero\\", feeling this \\"makes for an interesting contrast\\". Best Movie writer Irene Rosignoli commended Marinette's ability to transform from her shy civilian self into a courageous, confident, and resolute superhero, viewing it as a constructive message for girls throughout the world. Ladybug was characterized as an amazing superhero who can immediately impress the young viewers, and she was deemed capable, brave, and girls' favorite superhero. ===Popularity and merchandise=== Bandai's brand management vice president, Kenji Washida, described Marinette as \\"a quirky but lovable girl growing up, going to school and having first crushes\\", stating that she is a character \\"girls can relate to\\"; he said Marinette's superhero alter ego is \\"someone they want to be\\".

The genus was originally circumscribed in 1961 under the name Robertia; L. Travassos and G. R. Kloss created this genus for their newly-described species R. leiperi. The nomen novum, Traklosia, was created for this genus in 2015 ‚Äî Robertia was an invalid name due to a senior homonym. It consists of three species found in Brazil and Cuba, and they are parasites of millipedes. ==Taxonomic history== In 2015, Ernest C. Bernard and Gary Phillips coined Traklosia as nomen novum for Robertia. The word Traklosia comes from the first three letters in the surnames of L. Travassos and G. R. Kloss. Travassos and Kloss had circumscribed the genus Robertia for their newly-described species Robertia leiperi in 1961. The generic name Robertia was unavailable because a senior homonym, the synapsid genus Robertia, was named in 1948. Traklosia is the type genus of the family Traklosiidae, which was changed from Robertiidae. The genus Triumphalisnema is in the same family. Travassos and Kloss initially placed their genus Robertia in a new subfamily Robertiinae in the family Thelastomatidae. George Poinar Jr. recognized Robertiidae as its own family in 1977. In 1989, Adamson synonymized Robertiidae with Thelastomatidae. The family Traklosiidae is thought to be valid according to Gary Phillips and colleagues. ===Species=== , three species are recognized in the genus Traklosia. All of them were initially described with the generic name Robertia. The three species are: T. cubana, T. leiperi, and T. longicauda. The type species is T. leiperi, under its original combination Robertia leiperi. T. cubana was described in 1984 by S. E. Spiridonov of the USSR Academy of Science. T. leiperi was described in 1961 by L. Travassos and G. R. Kloss of the Oswaldo Cruz Institute. T. longicauda was described in 1995 by Nayla Garc√≠a, Alberto Coy, and Marianela √Ålvarez, all parasitologists at the Cuban Academy of Sciences. ==Diagnosis and description== Females in this genus are very small. The female reproductive system has only one genital tract. Their uteri are parallel and oriented to their posterior. They bear a single egg at a time, and eggs are ovalish. Their vagina points anteriorly and is in the posterior third of their body (excluding the tail). Males have a caudal extremity which suddenly narrows half-way making its end thread-like. Their genital cone is well developed. ==Distribution== Traklosia is found in South America and the West Indies. T. cubana and T. longicauda are both found in Cuba: T. cubana has been recorded in Guant√°namo along the Carretera Central between Im√≠as and Baracoa, and T. longicauda has been recorded in the National Botanical Garden in Havana. T. leiperi has been recorded in the Brazilian state of Rio de Janeiro. ==Hosts== Traklosia species infect hosts in the orders Coleoptera and Diplopoda. T. cubana and T. longicauda have both been found in the millipede genus Rhinocricus: T. cubana has been found in an unspecified Rhinocricus species and T. longicauda has been found in R. duvernoyi. T. leiperi has been found in the millipede species Eurydesmus ruidus. ==References== ==Further reading== * Category:Rhabditida genera Category:Parasites of arthropods ","title":"Traklosia"},{"id":"56573143","text":"He Couldn't Take It is a 1933 American comedy film directed by William Nigh and starring Ray Walker, Virginia Cherrill and George E.

The island makes up about 63% of the land area of Fr√∏ya municipality. The island lies in a large archipelago of islands in the Fr√∏yhavet sea, just northwest of the entrance to the Trondheimsfjorden. The Fr√∏yfjorden lies to the south of the island and that separates it from the large island of Hitra. The island is rocky with heather-covered moorland as well as marshes and lakes. There are no naturally forested areas on the island. The highest point on the island is Besselvassheia, at above sea level. The southern and eastern coasts are relatively smooth, but the northern coast is very jagged with many fjords and coves. Sletringen Lighthouse lies at the southwestern tip of the island. The island is connected to the mainland via the Fr√∏ya Tunnel which connects it to the neighboring island of Hitra. The island of Hitra is then connected to the mainland by the Hitra Tunnel. ==Name== The name of the island (and municipality) comes from Norse mythology. Although Fr√∏ya is a variant of the name of the Norse goddess Freyja, the Old Norse form of the name of the island was Fr√∏y or Frey (the ending -a in the modern form is actually the definite article - so the meaning of Fr√∏ya is 'the Fr√∏y'). Therefore, the name of the island probably has the same root as the name of the Norse god Freyr, brother to Freyja. The names originally were titles: \\"lord\\" or \\"lady\\". The oldest meaning of the common word was \\"(the one) in front; the foremost, the leading\\" and here in the sense \\"the island in front of Hitra\\". Until 1906 the island and municipality name was spelled Fr√∏ien (-en is the definite article in Danish-Norwegian). ==Media gallery== Flatval, Fr√∏ya - panoramio.jpgFlatval Gammelhuset p√• Fr√∏ya - panoramio.jpgHouse on Fr√∏ya Fylkesveg 451 i Soer- Troendelag.jpgRoad on Fr√∏ya Husvika - panoramio.jpgHusvika Sistranda, Fr√∏ya, Norway.jpgSistranda Fr√∏ya, N√≥rsko, apr√≠l 2016 - panoramio (7).jpgPlantlife on Fr√∏ya Two of everything.jpgHouses in Titran Titran in the evening.jpgView of Titran ==See also== *List of islands of Norway ==References== Category:Islands of Tr√∏ndelag Category:Fr√∏ya, Tr√∏ndelag ","title":"Fr√∏ya (island)"},{"id":"56573298","text":"Lysiphragma epixyla is a species of moth in the family Tineidae.

The series follows John Nolan, a man in his forties, who becomes the oldest rookie at the Los Angeles Police Department. The series is produced by ABC Studios and Entertainment One. The series stars Nathan Fillion, Alyssa Diaz, Richard T. Jones, Titus Makin Jr., Mercedes Mason, Melissa O'Neil, Afton Williamson, Mekia Cox and Eric Winter. The Rookie premiered on October 16, 2018. The first season ran until April 16, 2019. The second season ran from September 29, 2019, to May 10, 2020. In May 2020, ABC renewed the series for a third season. ==Premise== The series follows John Nolan, a forty-five-year-old newly divorced man from Pennsylvania, former owner of a construction company and father of a son in college, who, after inadvertently helping police officers during a bank robbery, moves to Los Angeles to pursue a new career as a police officer in the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD). After graduating from the Police Academy as the oldest rookie on the force, Nolan must navigate the dangerous, unpredictable nature of his job and is determined to make it in his new career despite the challenges. Series lead Nathan Fillion stated during an interview that the drama was inspired by a true story as the LAPD is one of just two agencies that accepts new officers over the age of 37. The man whose story inspired the premise of the show was later revealed to be Bill Norcross, who continues to serve in the LAPD and also as executive producer on The Rookie. ==Cast and characters== ===Main=== * Nathan Fillion as John Nolan: The oldest rookie (Police Officer I) at the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), he is assigned to the Wilshire Division. He studied law at Pennsylvania State University but dropped out upon learning his former girlfriend Sarah was pregnant and went into construction. At the age of 45, Nolan closed his construction company in Pennsylvania and moved out west to become a police officer. He is divorced with a 19-year-old son, Henry, who is a freshman in college. * Alyssa Diaz as Angela Lopez: An LAPD training officer (Police Officer III) on the cusp of making detective-trainee, a situation which is threatened when West is assigned to her. Although she gives West a hard time, Lopez also looks out for him. She is engaged to defense attorney Wesley Evers. * Richard T. Jones as Wade Grey: A sergeant (Sergeant II) and a watch commander of the Wilshire Station. Grey is initially against Nolan being a rookie because he feels that Nolan is having a midlife crisis and that being a police officer is not his true calling, but he later sees potential in him. Grey served in the United States Army prior to joining the LAPD. He has a daughter who is planning to go to college in the fall. * Titus Makin Jr. as Jackson West: An eager rookie officer (Police Officer I) and the son of Commander West, head of the LAPD's Internal Affairs Division. Top of his class at the Police Academy, West strives to be the best officer he can be despite his naive personality. Despite his commitment to the LAPD, West initially froze up whenever a shooting occurred and was nearly kicked from the training program by Bradford. He eventually redeems himself and has since moved past the shootings. He is close friends with Nolan and Chen and becomes the latter's roommate when he is forced to move out of his apartment after arresting his landlord. West is openly gay and is in a relationship with celebrity actor Sterling Freeman. * Mercedes Mason as Zoe Andersen (season 1): Nolan's confident and irreverent commanding officer, Captain Andersen was a former Marine with the military police. After leaving the Corps, she spent a year with the United States Pentagon Police Criminal Investigations Directorate before joining the LAPD. Because of her prior experience, Andersen rose up the ranks very quickly to the point where some of her officers saw her more as a boss than a fellow officer. Unlike Grey, she took Nolan under her wing and believed his life experiences would benefit the station. She was killed late in the first season while protecting Nolan from an attempt on his life. * Melissa O'Neil as Lucy Chen: An ambitious rookie cop (Police Officer I) who struggles to prove herself to Tim Bradford, her training officer. She is 28 years old and her parents are psychologists. She is close friends with Nolan and West and often hangs out with them while not on duty. She briefly had a romantic relationship with Nolan, despite it being against the rules. * Afton Williamson as Talia Bishop (season 1): A newly promoted training officer (Police Officer III) whose first assignment was Nolan. Throughout the first season, she worked hard to make detective and work her way up to chief of police. Near the end of the first season, Bishop was revealed to have lied about having an ex-con foster brother in order to get into the police academy. She does not return for the second season, as she has moved on to U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) rather than face a possibly stalled career in the LAPD. * Eric Winter as Tim Bradford: An overbearing training officer (Police Officer III). He is assigned Chen as a rookie and gives her a hard time. He used to be a squad leader and served in Iraq and Afghanistan before joining the LAPD. He was initially married to a fellow cop named Isabel, but her drug addiction eventually caused their marriage to fall apart. Later in the first season, he breaks off his relationship with Isabel entirely after she gets clean and starts dating social services agent Rachel Hall in the second season after losing a bet to Chen. * Mekia Cox as Nyla Harper (season 2): Nolan's new training officer (Police Detective I), a detective coming off of four years of undercover work who is trying to return to her patrol roots. She is also fighting with her ex-husband for joint custody of their daughter. ===Recurring=== * Mircea Monroe as Isabel Bradford (season 1): Tim Bradford's ex-wife, a former undercover narcotics officer who is now a drug addict * Danny Nucci as Sanford Motta (season 1): An arrogant major assault crimes detective who looks down on rookies * Sara Rue as Nell Forester: A dispatcher for the LAPD who Bradford bribes in order to get the best calls * Currie Graham as Ben McRee (season 1): Nolan's friend who lets Nolan stay in his mansion as a house guest * Demetrius Grosse as Kevin Wolfe (season 1): A detective who is assigned to Isabel's case * David DeSantos as Elijah Vestri (season 1): A detective who is assigned to Isabel's case * Shawn Ashmore as Wesley Evers: A defense lawyer with whom Lopez initially clashes but then starts dating.

She dated Nolan but later broke up with him in \\"Safety\\" when a pregnancy scare prompted them to realize that they wanted different things from their relationship at this time. * Harold Perrineau as Nick Armstrong (season 2): A new night detective who assists the LAPD Wilshire Division. Nolan is assigned to him on his first day and they become fast friends. Having made detective after only four years as a patrol officer, Nolan is eager to learn from him. A widower, Armstrong lost his wife to cancer while he was on a case to catch a ruthless serial killer and has since regretted not spending more time with her while she was alive. During the season 2 finale, Armstrong was revealed to be a dirty cop working for the Armenian mob as he needed money when his wife was in the hospital. When Nolan deduces that he is the mole in the LAPD, Armstrong quickly catches on and plants his money stash in Nolan‚Äôs house to frame him.

On February 7, 2018, Afton Williamson and Eric Winter were cast as Talia Bishop and Tim Bradford, respectively. They were shortly followed by Melissa O'Neil as Lucy Chen, Richard T. Jones as Sergeant Wade Grey, Titus Makin as Jackson West, Alyssa Diaz as Angela Lopez, and Mercedes Mason as Captain Zoe Andersen. On August 4, 2019, it was announced that Williamson would not be returning for the second season due to the alleged racial discrimination, sexual harassment, and sexual assault she suffered during the first season.

While the outlet initially claimed that the split was amicable, Williamson, in a lengthy Instagram post, stated that she had left the series due to having \\"experienced racial discrimination/racially charged inappropriate comments from the hair department.\\" Williamson also alleged that she was sexually harassed by a guest star, who was later identified as Demetrius Grosse, who portrays Kevin Wolfe in a recurring role, as well as an incident of bullying that escalated into sexual assault at a party; the head of the hair department was later identified as Sallie Ciganovich. Williamson claimed that she had gone to the showrunners multiple times with these allegations, but was ignored. Everyone involved in the allegations denied them. An investigation was commissioned through the law firm Mitchell Sillerberg and Knupp along with a third-party firm EXTTI, who conducted nearly 400 hours of interviews and examined video and other evidence. The results of the investigation were published on September 17, 2019, which found that the allegations made by Williamson had no merit, and could not be proven. Williamson stood by her claims, calling the results of the investigation \\"heartbreaking\\" and postulated that the producers had lied to cover up the truth of what happened. ==Release== ===Broadcast=== The Rookie is broadcast in the United States on ABC.

Players are allowed to bring up to 5 units in each stage with a \\"friend\\" unit in quest mode. Players make friends through friend request. Attacking units in a battle rewards the player with Brave Burst Crystals, and Heart Crystals. After an enemy is defeated, the player proceeds the next stage until the boss, which is required to go complete a level. After completing, players are rewarded with Zel and items, as well as acquiring units from each mission. When players complete the entire area, they'll be rewarded with one gem. However, if players fail a quest, they use one gem to continue. Units have the ability to execute special attacks, known as Brave Bursts and Super Brave Bursts. In departure to the original game, the game will be the first to feature a double protagonist system, allowing players to play the story of both main protagonist in the same game. a new mechanic known as Xross Brave Burst is introduced, which requires two or more units with mutual relationship to execute stronger attacks. Also, the game features an improved summoner avatar system and can be leveled up through branch evolution and be equipped with various weapons and items. Alongside the improved summoner avatar system is the ability to raise pets as companion in quests, which like units, can be evolvable to become stronger. The game's director, Eiji Takahashi also stated that standard features such as Frontier Hunter, Trials and Arena will also be included in the game's release. But unlike its predecessor, Brave Frontier 2 has no Gacha system to get new units, and relies more on buying new units using in-game currency.http://www.siliconera.com/2018/02/12/brave-frontier-2-launches-japan- february-22-smartphones-pc/ ==Story== 20 years after the defeat of Karna Masta and the restoration of summoning ability within the Akras Summoner's Hall, deep in the world of Extas, Fabulaska was arrested for copying data on a research forbidden to be accessed when two strange figures helped him in his escape. As this caught the eye of the Akras Summoners Hall back in Elgaia regarding the discovery of the new world, Noel, Lugina and Roy went to Extas to negotiate with the authorities for the capture of Fabulaska, in exchange for Noel's research data regarding the world of Bectas.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBINQKqs2UM 10 Years after, the year is A.I.E 300, a strange group called Negress were making their move, destroying countless kingdoms and worlds for their unknown ambitions.

But in the midst of their defeat, Augus used a strange orb to open a portal to another world, and Augus told both the hero and Rin to escape with the orb. However, the black knight commanded Shaia to attack the hero and Rin, distorting the portal as both of them were sucked away into the portal and were separated as they traversed into different worlds. Now, being separated from Rin and being found by the Akras Summoners, humanity's survival rests on the new hero and the Akras Summoners Guild in order to take down the dreaded Negress. ==Music== Unlike the music in Brave Frontier, which is synthesized, Brave Frontier 2 will feature a real Orchestra soundtrack done by the Tokyo City Philharmonic Orchestra and composed by Hikoshi Hashimoto, Kenji Ito, Minako Seki, Kaoru Wada, Noriyuki Iwadare, TAMAYO and Tadayoshi Makino. ==Development== The game was first revealed at the December 2016 broadcast of BureNama, announcing the title logo and brief plans regarding the sequel.https://app.famitsu.com/20161228_934715/ Takahashi also expresses his deep thanks regarding the success of the first game saying \\"In the future even after the new series has been released, the BF that is being enjoyed now, will continue to allow for both existing and new players to play it.

However, in a conversation I have with Hironobu Sakaguchi in the past, I remembered that he said \\"I think it's okay to put out a sequel or 2 or 3, even on a smartphone game\\", and as a result of considering various reasons, this time I wen to a sequel with a completely new work like this.\\" He also said regarding the story and main character that \\"The first Brave Frontier is focused on the hero in Elgaia and Grand Gaia.

The actor was cast in late 2015 and landed the regular role of Jack. Morley had previously played Spencer Harrington in fellow soap opera Home and Away for two years. He made his first appearance during the episode broadcast on 4 April 2016. The character departed on 30 March 2018, but Morley later reprised the role and returned on 26 February 2020, as part of the show's 35th anniversary celebrations. When Jack first arrives, he is involved in the explosion at Lassiters hotel and left unable to recall his identity. Morley described the character as one with a \\"clean slate\\" due to his amnesia and lack of family ties or connections to Erinsborough. Two months after his arrival, his name and identity as a Catholic priest was revealed. His storylines have subsequently focused on the conflict of his religious vocation and relationship with Paige Smith (Olympia Valance). His storylines have also focused on his rivalry with Mark Brennan (Scott McGregor) despite Morley stating that Jack has a lot of respect for him and feels that he is a good role model for his son. The character made a tough decision over leaving the priesthood and viewers have expressed negative feelings towards his relationship with Stephanie Scully (Carla Bonner) with one calling their relationship \\"disgusting\\" and another seeing the coupling as \\"random\\". With Paige unsure about whether to tell Jack about the paternity of her baby, Katie Baillie from Metro UK showed her compassion for Jack but later felt that he didn't act like an adult when he gets into a fight with Mark. ==Casting== On 31 January 2016, Holly Byrnes from The Daily Telegraph announced the former Home and Away star Andrew Morley's casting on Neighbours as John Doe. Morley was asked to film an audition tape after he had received an email from his manager whilst in Cambodia helping raise money and awareness towards human trafficking. Morley began filming in December 2015. Morley commented on working with Paige Smith actress Olympia Valance describing her as \\"extremely friendly\\" and of a \\"great energy\\". Valance reminded Morley of Demi Harman, who he worked with early on on Home And Away. When Morley first got the role, he was not briefed on what his characters true identity was and where the character was going. He also said that his characters alias 'John Doe' was still written on his scripts at times he was filming scenes under the name Jack. He later added that he now knows what direction his character is going in and said \\"it'll be a big story arc\\". He also said that the audience will be taken through \\"a really interesting journey of trying to work out who he is\\" in finding out what his character is doing in Erinsborough, what significance his character is going to have and who his character will be involved with. Morley added that his character has a \\"clean slate\\" as he has no connections to anyone in Erinsborough. == Development == === Introduction and characterisation === Jack arrives in Erinsborough with no family ties and a 'mysterious past' of which Paige helps him discover. Morley said that \\"Paige helps him to discover who he is\\", together they work out why he is in Erinsborough. Morley said, \\"It's been fun piecing together the puzzle.\\" After he is involved in a fire at the Lassiter's complex in his first scenes, he suffers amnesia. Determined to find out his past, Paige becomes curious in Jack and decides to visit him in hospital, later becoming fascinated by him. With his details unknown, he is given the name John Doe. When talking about John's future identity, Morley described it as \\"completely off the scales\\". He also guaranteed that nobody would pick what his character turns out to be. Morley said \\"It's a good little journey and the audience is going to love it.\\" He later remembers that he is a Catholic Priest and goes to the police station to inform them of his past and his true identity is confirmed as Father Jack Callahan. Jack is described to be a \\"man of God\\" and to have \\"devoted his life to religion and helping people\\", with being a \\"genuine, kind, sincere and loving person\\". His reasonings for being in Erinsborough were also revealed, with Jack only passing through and staying at a friends house. He was at Lassiter's on the day of the blast off to help someone who had talked to him during confession. ===Relationship with Paige Smith=== After the explosion at Lassiter's, Paige visits John Doe in hospital, hoping to find out about his past. Mandy Franze (Kristy Best) turns up and claims she knows John and is the love of his life. After Mandy kisses John, Paige is forced to accept that she has lost him for good. Paige falls for John and the feeling is mutual, with Morley describing it as \\"true love for both of them\\" and that \\"Jack has never felt like this about anybody.\\" However, with John revealed as Jack Callahan, a Catholic priest, Morley also explains that it will be a dilemma for Jack on deciding who he will devote his life to. Paige meets Dustin Oliver (Kevin Clayette), a person from Jack's past, and kisses him, much to Jack's dismay. After Jack dreams of a kiss with Paige, he goes to Father Guidotti (John Orcsik), the local priest for advice. He later prays and asks God for a sign. After Father Guidotti dies, Jack sees this as the sign he asked for from God, with Jack feeling his death was down to God allowing him to continue his work in Erinsborough. With Paige feeling upset about Jack's decision, she confesses to her mother, Lauren Carpenter (Kate Kendall), that she is unable to think straight around him, vowing to keep her distance. However, after she realises Jack shares the same feelings as her, she decides to boycott the plan and spend as much time around him as possible. Paige later goes to confession and tells Jack of her recent hookups, to show that she has moved on from him. Daniel Killelly from Digital Spy commented on Paige's visit to confession saying, \\"Jack Callahan is probably used to awkward confessional visits every now and again, but this one really takes the biscuit\\". After Paige dresses up as a nun, Jack feels like she is making a mockery of what he believes in. This leaves them no longer on speaking terms, but after Paige goes on a hot air balloon trip that ends up crashing, Jack comes to find Paige and the pair sleep together. However, an old friend of Jack's, Simone Bader (Kahli Williams), turns up in Erinsborough and after finding out Jack had slept with Paige, she questions if she is worth leaving the priesthood over. Paige finds out she is pregnant with Jack's baby, but decides against telling him. When Jack comes to Paige's rescue after she is involved in a car accident, she reveals to Jack that the baby is his. Paige considers leaving Erinsborough to move to Queensland along with her parents, taking the baby away and leaving Jack behind, but ultimately decides to stay. Paige goes back to where the baby is conceived and goes into labour and gives birth to a son, Gabriel Smith (Kian Bafekrpour). Jack along with Karl Kennedy (Alan Fletcher) come to Paige's rescue and takes her and the baby to hospital. The pair later reunite and sleep together, betraying both their partners. Morley commented in an interview with Radio Times, \\"At that moment and with Gabe in front of them, everything felt so right and they went for it. That gave Jack hope but afterwards Paige wants to bury it and forget it happened. This hurts Jack who wants to tell Steph, even though he knows she'd be upset, but Paige is not of the same mindset and regrets it.\\" He added, \\"Most of the feedback suggests fans want Jack and Paige to be together. It was hard playing the Steph and Jack relationship because it didn‚Äôt have the substance he had with Paige, so naturally the audience isn't going to believe in it as much. I loved working with Carla Bonner (Steph Scully) as we get on great and hang out a lot. But the audience will want Jack with Paige, though Paige is committed to Mark Brennan (Scott McGregor) who is a great guy and a lovable character... Fans will be torn as no one is the villain here, and everyone ends up getting hurt in some way.\\" === Relationship with Stephanie Scully === After Steph helps Jack look after his son, Gabe, they develop feelings for one another and have sex. However Paige later bans Steph from being around Gabe due to her past mental health issues. This causes Steph to end her relationship with Jack, feeling that he needs to focus on his family and believing that things wouldn't have worked out with Jack in the long run anyway. Continuing their relationship however, Jack realises he is not Steph's priority when 'having a relationship' didn't feature on a list of what she wants to do in her life. After Steph returns from a Christmas break with her mother, Steph expects to see Jack waiting for her when she returns, however instead he is with Paige. When he eventually sees Steph, he cancels his lunch with her to spend time with Gabe and Paige, but Steph insists she comes along too. She later becomes irritated as Jack's attention is focused on Gabe during the outing. However, Steph talks to her friend Toadfish Rebecchi (Ryan Moloney) about her concerns, feeling the age difference between herself and Jack may be too big. Toadie later gives Jack advice on how he can keep Steph happy in their relationship. On 25 January 2018, Sasha Morris from The Daily Star questioned if this was the beginning of a love triangle between the couple and Paige. On 5 February 2018, Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy reported that Jack and Paige would have a one-night stand. Kilkelly also reported that Steph would seek revenge when she finds out about the affair with her ransacking Jack's room at the backpackers in a fit of anger but later confesses to the police of her actions. This brings repercussions for Steph as her planned trip for visiting her son in Fiji is ruined as her overseas visa is revoked due to the criminal charges for the damage. === Rivalry with Mark Brennan === Scott McGregor (pictured) plays Mark, Jack's rival. On 13 November 2017, it was reported by Kilkelly (Digital Spy) that Jack would \\"drive\\" Paige and Mark's relationship apart when he discovers that the pair are arguing. Jack challenges Mark about his behaviour, but without an explanation Mark is forced to steer clear from Paige and his baby. Later, in December 2017, Digital Spy reported that Jack would get into a \\"violent\\" fight with Mark in the new 2018 season. After Gabe is kidnapped, with Paige dating Mark, he becomes involved and tensions rise between the pair. With Elly Conway (Jodi Anasta) and Amy Williams (Zoe Cramond) determined to get Jack and Mark on better terms, they decide to get them together with a game of Croquet. But a feud starts to arise and meets its climax when the pair have a \\"full-blown brawl\\" in public. Sophie Dainty from Digital Spy described the scenes as \\"explosive\\". During the fight, Jack's anger causes him to tell Mark how he really feels and blames Mark for his son's recent abduction. After Paige discusses the \\"awkwardness\\", \\"occasional violence\\" and how Jack feels threatened by Mark as he feels he is \\"muscling in on his family\\", Paige goes to see Jack. When Paige turns up, old feelings arise from their previous relationship and Jack ends up sleeping with Paige. When asked in an interview with Radio Times about how Jack feels about Mark ‚Äî Morley replied, \\"Jack has a lot of respect for him, he's nice guy and a great role model for Gabe. However he wasn't thinking of Mark's feelings when he slept with Paige, although Jack is upset that he's hurt the guy. Paige truly wants to settle down with Mark, but she knows what she did with Jack and her mind is in two places at once...\\" On 17 February 2018, Kilkelly (Digital Spy) reported that tensions may be flaring up again when Mark's temper puts Gabe in danger whilst with Paige and Jack. ===Departure and return=== On 19 March 2018, it was confirmed that Morley would be leaving Neighbours alongside Valance. After seeing how much Mark is struggling with their relationship, Paige and Jack decide to leave Erinsborough for a fresh start in Queensland with their son. On 24 November 2019, Neighbours confirmed that Morley would reprise the role for the serial's 35th anniversary celebrations. Jack returns alongside Paige on 26 February 2020. ==Storylines== Shortly after arriving at the Lassiter's Complex, John bumps into Paige Smith. They run into each other again outside the hotel, just as the boiler room explodes. John throws himself on top of Paige to protect her. He is taken to the hospital, where he remains in a coma. One of the nurses tells Paige that they do not know who he is, as he had no identification on him. Paige stays by his bedside and is present when he wakes up. John suffers from amnesia and cannot remember his own name. Paige gets him a job with Amy Williams's handywoman business. Amy also offers him a place to live. John meets with a hotel employee, who spoke to him on the day of the explosion, but she cannot help him find out who he is. Paige puts up flyers, asking if anyone can identify John. A hotel guest named Steven Aniston (Garikai Jani) recalls John saying he has links with Geelong. John and Paige travel to the city and stay in a local hostel. Just as Paige and John are about to kiss, Paige spots a photograph of John with another man, who they later learn is Dustin Oliver (Kevin Clayette). They arrange to meet Dustin in Erinsborough. He greets John as \\"Jay\\", before he runs away when he spots Mark Brennan in his police uniform. John decides to leave town, but Paige persuades him to stay. John has two hypnosis sessions with Karl Kennedy, who later refers him to a psychiatrist. Mandy Franze claims to be John's girlfriend, but they soon find out she is lying. Paige tries to kiss John, but he rejects her and Paige asks him to leave. John sees a woman driving a van and says he remembers her and the company, which he later learns repairs boilers. John suffers flashbacks of the Lassiter's boiler room and believes that he may have caused the explosion. He then goes to the police to confess, but the detective tells him that he did not cause the explosion. John kisses Paige. The witness who saw him on the morning of the explosion later reveals she was paid to lie. John's memory returns and he is able to tell Mark that Julie Quill (Gail Easdale) and Jacka Hills (Brad McMurray) caused the explosion. Paige comes to the station and John emerges in clerical clothing. He reveals his name is Jack Callahan and that he is a priest. He explains that he was questioning his faith when he came to Erinsborough and was staying with a priest in Elliot Park, but when he went away to Rome, Jack was left to counsel Julie at the church. He followed her to Lassiter's and saw her in the boiler room, but did not expect her to cause an explosion. Jack briefly leaves Erinsborough to see his family and Paige says she will wait for him. Jack faces conflicting pressures between his love for Paige and his vow of celibacy. Jack looks after a little girl named Poppy Jarvis, who has cystic fibrosis, whilst her mother is in hospital, and he organises an fancy dress party for her. Ari Philcox reveals in the confessional that he's been releasing the snakes. Jack's priestly vows forbid him passing on this information. Jack thinks that Paige is the intended target, but later learns that Steph is. Jack receives an audio message from Paige's sister, Piper Willis (Mavournee Hazel) of Paige declaring her love to him while on a hot air balloon trip, but during the voice message, Jack learns that Paige and her family are in danger and drives to the crash site. Jack sees everyone except for Paige, and Piper tells him that Paige jumped off the balloon before it crashed. Jack goes to find her and finds her red scarf in a dam. After searching, he finds an unconscious Paige on the shore, who suffers from hypothermia. He carries her to an abandoned shack to warm her up. Jack told Paige that he knows how sorry she is and confess his love to Paige. The pair then sleep together, reconciling their relationship. They are soon found by Paige's father, Brad Willis (Kip Gamblin). Jack leaves for Queensland, later returning with his former girlfriend, Simone Bader, causing Paige to again feel betrayed. Jack and Paige break up as he chooses the church over her again. Jack becomes jealous over Paige's friendship with David Tanaka (Takaya Honda). Jack finds out that Paige is pregnant and Jack assumes he's the father, but Paige says that he's not and that David is the father. Jack wants Dustin Oliver to help with a new refugee centre, but Dustin refuses thinking, wrongly, that he may be the father of Paige's baby, and wants to get away. When Jack learns that he is the father of Paige's baby, he considers leaving the priesthood and remaining in Erinsborough with Paige, whose parents are leaving for the Gold Coast. Paige considers leaving with them, but decides to stay, so Jack can be with his child. Paige returns to the shack where their child was conceived and goes into labour. Jack and Karl find her and help deliver her son. Paige loses consciousness and is rushed to the hospital, while the baby is taken to a neonatal unit. Jack decides to leave the church. Lauren returns to support Paige, and is initially angry with Jack for letting Paige go off on her own. Paige eventually regains consciousness and names their son Gabriel. After learning Paige's sister is ill, Jack encourages Paige to go to Queensland with Lauren to support her. Having decided to give up his position within the church, Jack calls Bishop Green (Mirko Grillini). Bishop Green tells Jack that if he quits the priesthood the church will close. He decides to go through with his plan and leaves the church. He moves into Erinsborough Backpackers. Jack declares his feelings for Paige, but she rejects him. Jack works with Stephanie Scully on an application for the Most Liveable Suburb competition and they kiss. Steph initially calls it a mistake, but they later have sex and soon begin a relationship. Jack supports Steph when she thinks she is having a mental health relapse, and when she turns her motel into a cancer wellness centre. Jack secures a job at Erinsborough High as a counsellor, but some students accuse him of promoting religion, though he is later vindicated. When Gabe is kidnapped by Louise McLeod (Maria Theodorakis), Jack blames Mark for his family's involvement in the dodgy dealings of Hamish Roche (Sean Taylor), the father of Mark's brother Tyler (Travis Burns). He also calls the police when Mark attempts to negotiate with Louise despite Mark advising him not to, delaying the search. Although Gabe is later found and returned by Cassius Grady (Joe Davidson), Jack is still steamed with Mark, resulting in a brawl with him during a day out. Jack and Paige later have a one-night stand, which Steph and Mark discover after the four take a glamping trip. They break up with their respective partners, and after realising the damage their actions have caused, Jack, Paige and Gabe move to Queensland to be closer to Paige's parents. Two years later, Paige returns to Erinsborough and informs her former stepmother Terese Willis (Rebekah Elmaloglou) that she believes Jack is having an affair. Jack also returns and reveals that he was talking to Mark Gottlieb (Bruce Samazan) about rejoining the priesthood. They later decide to break up and Jack returns to Queensland. He later returns with Gabe after Paige announces that she is marrying Mark. The following day, he presides over Sky Mangel (Stephanie McIntosh) and Lana Crawford's (Bridget Neval) wedding. Upon discovering that there is a vacancy at a parish church in Adelaide, where Mark is living, he offers to move there so Paige and Gabe can do so as well. == Reception == Near to his first appearance while his identity remained unknown, sources weren't sure what to make of John, with Kilkelly (Digital Spy) describing him as \\"mysterious\\" and Sam Warner (Digital Spy) commenting, \\"it's unclear if he is a hero or villain\\". Dainty (Digital Spy) felt that the character of Jack caused big changes to Paige's life, describing him as \\"the priest who turned Paige Smith's life upside down\\". Katie Baillie from the Metro called Jack a \\"poor lad\\" after Paige doesn't tell him about the baby. She later showed him compassion when Paige told him her baby was his, commenting, \\"In fairness, it is pretty bad news for the guy, given that he's in the priesthood and shouldn't be making babies. But hearing it from Paige as she thinks she's about to die and learning other people knew this whole time isn't ideal for him either.\\" However, she later lets on that Jack may have a bit of a childish side after getting into a fight with Mark over Paige, commenting, \\"Jack can't act like an adult about it all.\\" Fans disliked the pairing of Jack and Steph, labelling the paring \\"disgusting\\", \\"dumb\\" and \\"random\\". When Steph fails to priortise her relationship with Jack, fans expressed their disapproval of the relationship again, commenting, \\"I don't like Jack and Steph at all. Time to split!\\" ==References== ==External links== * Jack Callahan at the Official Neighbours website.

It captures the atmosphere of the familiar convenience store that is so much part of life in Japan. The novel won the Akutagawa Prize in 2016. Aside from working as a writer, Murata worked at a convenience store three times a week, basing her novel on her experiences. It was first published in the June 2016 issue of Bungakukai. It was published published as a book in July 2016 by Bungeishunj≈´. An English- language translation by Ginny Tapley Takemori was released by Grove Press (US) and Portobello Books (UK) in 2018. It is the first of Murata's novels to be translated into English. ==Plot== Keiko Furukura is a 36-year old woman who has been working part-time at a convenience store, or konbini, for the last 18 years. She has known since childhood that she is \\"different\\" and that expressing her own views and actions is inexplicable and distressing to others, and causes problems. The highly regulated world of the konbini, where each action is prescribed by the corporate manual, allows her to maintain an identity acceptable to those around her and a sense of purpose. She models her behaviour, dress style, and even speech patterns on those of her coworkers. Keiko maintains some friendships and a relationship with her sister, but finds it increasingly difficult to explain why, after 18 years, she is still single and working as a temp in a convenience store. In the novel, she meets Shiraha, a man who cannot hold a steady job and lives on the fringes of society since he doesn't conform to \\"normal\\" expectations. While they have no affection for each other, Shiraha eventually moves in with Keiko. They decide that by pretending to be a couple, they can avoid problems with families and a society that expects them to have romantic relationships, children, and stable jobs. As part of the plan, Keiko eventually quits her job in the konbini, though she immediately feels that her life has lost purpose. She stays home doing nothing, and only at Shiraha's insistence applies for steady jobs. On the way to the first job interview, Keiko and Shiraha stop at a konbini. She sees that the store is not as regulated and immediately begins rearranging the merchandise and assisting the staff.

Mazza was born in and served as a priest in Verona and was dedicated to both the evangelization of Central Africa (he used to be called \\"Don Congo\\" due to this) and equal access to a good education. He served as a teacher for over three decades as well as a chaplain and was known for his dedication to the Christian formation of children. Mazza was also a student and close friend to Saint Gaspare Bertoni and was also close with a range of prominent prelates including Saint Daniele Comboni whom he sent to the missions in Africa. Mazza's beatification process opened in the 1920s and culminated on 3 June 2013 after Pope Francis confirmed his heroic virtue and named Mazza as Venerable. ==Life== Portrait in the order's headquarters: Mazza blesses missionaries. Nicola Mazza was born on 10 March 1790 in Verona as the eldest of nine brothers to the silk and fabric merchants Luigi Mazza and Rosa Pajola. His parents managed a fabric store in the Piazza delle Erbe. The Mazza's moved to Marcellise in 1797 following the French occupation; the town was a hamlet of San Martino Buon Albergo. In 1821 his father was forced to sell his estate and villa due to financial difficulties. He was a student to the priest Antonio Cesari and was also a close disciple to Saint Gaspare Bertoni who both proved to be strong influences on Mazza's life and personal spiritual inclinations. Cesari was brought in to homeschool Mazza since the latter's often frail health prevented him from going to school. His vocation matured under Cesari's guidance and he soon felt called to enter the priesthood as a more direct means to dedicate himself to the needs of the poor. He commenced his ecclesial studies in Verona on 21 June 1807 before Mazza received his ordination to the priesthood on 26 March 1814. Following his ordination he first served in the churches of S. Fermo Maggiore and San Nicol√≤ before being assigned in 1816 to teach seminarians in Verona. For over three decades from 1816 until 1849 he taught students in Verona both mathematics (from 1815 to 1816) and, occasionally, physics and world history. The students held him in high regard as did fellow teachers while some of his students included the Venerable Antonio Provolo and Blessed Zefirino Agostini. It was also around this time that he became a confessor and close friend to the Venerable Teresa Campostrini. His professorship solidified his desire to create a range of opportunities for people to have a fairer and better access to education irrespective of their class or economic status. His companions around this point following his ordination - students and confreres alike - knew of Mazza's desire to evangelize Africa and referred to him as \\"Don Congo\\". On 14 September 1838 the Emperor Ferdinand I awarded him a large golden medal with a necklace in tribute to Mazza's work in the field of culture and education. Mazza sent six missionaries in 1857 to Central Africa with the hope of evangelizing the region which had been a lifelong ambition for him despite the fact that he never set foot on the African continent. He blessed the new missionaries which included Saint Daniele Comboni and Giovanni Beltrame who became prominent figures in the missions there. Mazza had also sent Francesco Oliboni and Angelo Melotto as well as Alessandro dal Bosco while also sending Isidoro Zilli who was neither a priest nor religious but a catechist. Mazza held the view that the African people alone could be successful in evangelizing since their efforts would be much more successful among their own people as opposed to foreigners. His health began to decline in July 1865 and he died the following month. The local papers Eco de Veneto and Nuova Gazzetta di Verona followed the news of Mazza's declining health from the outset until Mazza's death a month later after news broke of his failing health. Mazza's remains are interred in the church of San Carlo Borromeo. ==Beatification process== Mazza's beatification process opened in 1925 in an investigation that had been launched in Verona and had closed in 1927 while a second process opened in that diocese in 1934 and was later closed in 1937. The third and final investigation into Mazza's life and works was launched several decades later in 1988 and closed not long after in 1989. The Congregation for the Causes of Saints validated the investigation in Rome on 14 December 1990 and later received the Positio dossier from the postulation in two parts in 2000 and 2003 for assessment. It was in between that period that the historical consultants to the C.C.S. approved the cause on 1 October 2002 based on the part of the Positio that had been submitted in 2002. Theologians advising the C.C.S. likewise confirmed the cause a decade later on 21 February 2012 as did the C.C.S. cardinal and bishop members on 21 May 2013. Mazza was declared to be Venerable on 3 June 2013 after Pope Francis confirmed that the late priest had lived a life of heroic virtue. The current postulator for this cause is Fr. Francesco Massagrande. ==References== ==External links== * Hagiography Circle Category:1790 births Category:1865 deaths Category:18th-century Italian people Category:18th-century Roman Catholic priests Category:18th-century venerated Christians Category:19th-century Italian educators Category:19th- century Roman Catholic priests Category:19th-century venerated Christians Category:Italian Roman Catholic priests Category:People from Verona Category:Venerated Catholics by Pope Francis ","title":"Nicola Mazza"},{"id":"56574454","text":"Tim Dunn is an American farmer and politician and a Republican member of the Arizona House of Representatives representing District 13 since February 13, 2018.

The Victorian building is listed. ==Early Churches== A church in the locality is first recorded in the twelfth century, though the date of its founding and its dedication are now unknown. At this time, Whitchurch was a chapel of ease to Llandaff Cathedral, and would remain so until the 19th Century. The first church which is known to have carried the dedication to Mary was first erected in the 14th Century. In the 15th or 16th Century, a porch was added, followed later still by a nave, then a belfry of Bath stone. The graveyard dated from 1616, when a licence for baptisms, marriages and burials was obtained. Later alterations to the interior were carried out in 1810. The old church could seat 300. Despite the fact that it was growing too small for the growing population (which the new Melingriffith Tin Plate Works had bolstered to 696), the issue of the church's inadequate facilities would not be addressed for several decades. During the 19th Century, Whitchurch also acquired its first Nonconformist places of worship, with the Whitchurch Methodist Church being founded in . ==Modern Church== As Whitchurch gradually evolved into a suburb over the 19th Century, the population of the district continued to expand. Whitchurch became a separate parish in 1845. The Revd. J.T. Clarke, who became the vicar of St Mary's in 1876, was dissatisfied by the inadequate (and increasingly rundown) church, and began to agitate for a replacement. The new church was finally provided in 1884, located around 300 metres to the south-south-west from its predecessor. It was designed by John Prichard, and was consecrated for worship in 1885. After its replacement came into use, the old church was largely abandoned and lapsed into decay. It was ruinous by the turn of the 20th Century and was demolished in 1904. Its graveyard remained until being converted into a public garden, St Mary's Gardens, in 1973, which is still extant on Old Church Road. The church became Listed in 1975. ==Organisation== The church is now in the Rectorial Benefice of Whitchurch. It has three daughter churches: All Saints (Rhiwbina), All Saints (Llandaff North) and St Thomas's (Birchgrove).

Notable faculty have included U.S. Court of Appeals Judge Amy Coney Barrett. ==Overview== Sir William Blackstone in 1774 Blackstone Legal Fellowship is a highly competitive, nine week intensive summer legal training program which spans June though August. It was founded in 2000 for the purpose of preparing Christian law students for professional legal careers. The first class comprised 24 interns. Since its inception Blackstone has trained more than 1,900 Christian law students. In an interview, ADF co-founder Alan Sears said in 2000 Blackstone was created in response to his observation, \\"There‚Äôs got to be a better way for law students in America and for young lawyers than we currently have.\\" The program is made up of interns, called Fellows, from a diverse selection of law schools as well as elite institutions such as Harvard and Yale. The program is named for Sir William Blackstone, the famed eighteenth century English legal scholar and jurist whose influential commentaries on the common law had a profound impact on the Founding Fathers of the United States.Bailyn, Bernard, The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution (2017 edition).

It was revealed on 14 December 2018 as the winner of competition in which over 3,000 people from the county voted. The overlaid Saltire and Nordic crosses denote Sutherland's unique history on the mainland where the extent of Viking control met Scotland. The golden sun that is formed where the arms of the crosses meet symbolise the sun raised high in the south for the origin of the county's name South Land as well as the sunrises seen on the east coast and sunsets on Sutherland's west coast. The black recalls the peat of the Flow Country and dark skies and together with the white recall the central colours of the former Sutherland Council arms. ==History== A competition was established by the local community in conjunction with the Flag Institute, and a flag was announced as the winner in the Northern Times newspaper in January 2018. The design was selected by a judging panel. The county's Lord Lieutenancy, however, froze the flag's registration with the Court of the Lord Lyon in March 2018 in light of opposition to the flag's design and the nature of the competition. The Sutherland Flag Committee announced in October 2018 that a public vote would be held to choose a flag. The shortlist of designs chosen by the judging panel will include the originally announced design. ===Original design=== The original design announced by the Lord Lieutenancy in January 2018 features a swooping eagle, seen face on, against a vertical bicoloured red and yellow background, with the eagle counterchanged yellow and red. The bicolour of red and yellow represents the Atlantic Ocean and North Sea, which border the county on its west and east coasts respectively. At the hoist are three stars or mullets. These, plus the red and yellow colour combination, are taken from the arms borne by Hugh de Moray, Earl of Sutherland. === Reception === The design originally announced as the flag of Sutherland After a county newspaper, The Northern Times, published the final design, some Sutherland residents expressed disapproval, mainly through social media. Complaints focused on the colours, said to evoke communism, and that the eagle was crudely drawn and not the best choice to represent the region. It was suggested that the Scottish wildcat, a symbol associated with Sutherland, would have made a more appropriate choice. A spokesman for the flag selection committee countered that the \\"eagle featured prominently on a considerable number of the entries\\", that the wildcat is more associated with Caithness, and an eagle is more unifying as being prominent across the county. The Court of the Lord Lyon started of the process of formally recognising the flag in early February 2018. A petition was put forth by one Sutherland resident to redesign the flag. The Vice Lord Lieutenant of Sutherland and chairman of the Flag Selection Committee asserted though that feedback, outside of social media, and especially from schools and young people from across Sutherland continues to indicate very strong support for the design. Due to the opposition towards the design, the office of the Lord Lyon halted the process of registering the flag, stating: \\"I understand that the petitioners (the Lord Lieutenancy) are considering the matter and, until we hear from them, no further procedures will take place in our office.\\" ==Public vote== In October 2018, the Sutherland Flag Committee announced that a public vote would be held to choose the Sutherland flag.

It sets out twenty-four principles to be followed to manage market risk in financial market infrastructure. In the United Kingdom, the Bank of England acts as regulator for payment systems, central securities depositories and central counterparties. For these regulated organisations, the bank requires the operator complies with the CPSS-IOSCO principles. == Principles == === General organisation === ==== Principle 1: Legal basis ==== The operations of the system must have a clear basis in the law of the jurisdictions it operates in. This is important to avoid the uncertainty that would result if there was the possibility that the courts might void or hold-up transactions. ==== Principle 2: Governance ==== Market governance arrangements must be clear and transparent. They should support the stability of the market and take account of the wider public interest. ==== Principle 3: Framework for the comprehensive management of risks ==== The market operator must have a proper risk management framework. === Credit and liquidity risk management === ==== Principle 4: Credit risk ==== The market operator must carefully manage its credit exposure to market participants, and have sufficient resources to cover any credit risk it is exposed to. ==== Principle 5: Collateral ==== If the market requires collateral, it must choose collateral with low credit, liquidity and market risks. ==== Principle 6: Margin ==== Central counterparties must manage their credit exposure to market participants by ensuring they have an effective margin system. ==== Principle 7: Liquidity risk ==== The market operator must monitor and manage liquidity risk. === Settlement === ==== Principle 8: Settlement finality ==== Liabilities incurred must be settled with finality, at the very least at the end of the day where value is credited, but ideally in real-time. ==== Principle 9: Money settlements ==== The system should settle in central bank money wherever possible. Credit risk and liquidity risk must be minimised. ==== Principle 10: Physical deliveries ==== If the market deals with securities or commodities, there must be clear rules about their physical delivery. Risks relating to the storage and delivery of physical securities and commodities must be managed. === Central securities depositories and exchange-of-value settlement systems === ==== Principle 11: Central securities depositories ==== Where a securities depository holds the underlying securities of a market it must manage this 'safeguarding' risk, and ensure the securities are held separately from its own assets. ==== Principle 12: Exchange-of-value settlement systems ==== Where two linked obligations are exchanged in a transaction (for example, foreign exchange), the settlement of one must be conditional on the settlement of the other. === Default management === ==== Principle 13: Participant-default rules and procedures ==== The market needs to have rules to cope with the default of a market participant, ensuring the losses are contained and liquidity preserved to allow the market to continue to operate. ==== Principle 14: Segregation and portability ==== For a central counterparty, it must be possible to segregate and move the positions of the participants' customers. === General business and operational risk management === ==== Principle 15: General business risk ==== The market operator must manage its own business risks to ensure it can continue as a going concern. It must maintain a reserve to ensure it can be wound down in an orderly fashion if the need arises. ==== Principle 16: Custody and investment risks ==== Assets, whether belonging to the market operator or market participants, must be safeguarded against losses. Any investments must be chosen for minimal credit, liquidity and market risks. ==== Principle 17: Operational risk ==== A financial market must identify operational risks: both internally and across the market and its participants. Where appropriate, they should mitigate the risks through controls. Systems used by the market must have a high degree of reliability and security, and must have sufficient capacity for the needs of the market. Business continuity must be in place to recover from disruption. === Access === ==== Principle 18: Access and participation requirements ==== Criteria for participating in the market must be objective and transparent, ensuring fair and open access. ==== Principle 19: Tiered participation arrangements ==== Where the financial market has participants at different tiers (i.e. direct participants, and indirect participants who are themselves serviced by the direct participants) then the market operator needs to monitor and manage the risks that such indirect relationships could cause. ==== Principle 20: FMI links ==== If a financial market infrastructure (FMI) is interlinked to another FMI then it needs to monitor and manage the risks relating to that relationship. === Efficiency === ==== Principle 21: Efficiency and effectiveness ==== Financial markets should be structured to efficiently and effectively meet the needs they were created to serve. ==== Principle 22: Communication procedures and standards ==== The market should use relevant and internationally accepted methods of communicating transactions. === Transparency === ==== Principle 23: Disclosure of rules, key procedures, and market data ==== The rules and procedures of the financial market must be clear. Participants must have sufficient information to enable them to understand the risks that they take by participating in the market, and the costs of doing so. Rules and key procedures must be disclosed publicly. ==== Principle 24: Disclosure of market data by trade repositories ==== A trade repository must disclose relevant market information to the public and government authorities that is timely and accurate. ==References== == External links == * CPSS-IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures Category:2012 documents Category:Works about finance ","title":"CPSS-IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures"},{"id":"56574768","text":"Albert Sal√©za (18 October 1867 ‚Äì 26 November 1916) was a French tenor. == Biography == Born in Bruges,Archives des Pyr√©n√©es Atlantiques, commune de Bruges, birth certificate No 32, year 1867 last child of a large family of 12 children, and, as an orphan from the age of 8 years old, Sal√©za was sent to a Girondine property of senator where he became an assistant shepherd. But the country sickness forced him to return to his native commune where he became a sandal worker. Difficulty feeding led him to accept a job as a gravel digger on the Pau-Laruns railway, then as a sandaler in Bayonne, where wages were higher. At his places of work, his voice was noticed by two Basque music lovers, who introduced him to the director of the music school, Mr. Jubin, and then to his first teacher, Gaston Salzedo. With this one, Sal√©za, who had hitherto received only a basic education, made rapid progress in all fields: instruction, diction, singing, music... so much so that he won the First prize of the school in 1886, which allowed him to integrate the Conservatoire de Paris where he won again the first prize in singing and the second prize in opera before a jury composed notably of L√©o Delibes and Ambroise Thomas. On leaving the conservatory, because of his fragile health, he chose the Op√©ra- Comique instead of the Opera which would have been too demanding so quickly. From his first role, Mylio in Le roi d'Ys, his performance aroused the enthusiasm of the audience at the Salle Favart. From the Op√©ra-Comique, Albert Sal√©za moved on to the Op√©ra de Nice where he recovered his strength. He gained further notoriety by interpreting Faust, Rom√©o et Juliette, Carmen, Richard III... Benque & cie. In 1892, Ernest Reyer noticed him and offered him the consecration by giving him a role tailored to his needs at the Paris Opera: Matho in Salammb√¥. The triumph he obtained allowed him to repeat success after success: Le Cid, Die Walk√ºre, la Damnation de Faust His fame was so great that Verdi offered him the role of Otello that he performeded 35 times until May 1895. Unfortunately, health problems hit his vocal chords and forced him to stop for 2 years. In 1897, Sal√©za returned to the Op√©ra de Paris, then, in Monte Carlo, Brussels and Covent Garden of London where he sang in particular in Carmen with Emma Calv√©, and Rom√©o et Juliette with Nellie Melba, and very often in front of the future king Edward VII. He reached the pinnacle of his glory in Chicago and the Metropolitan of New York, thanks to his interpretations in Faust, Lucia di Lammermoor, Les Huguenots‚Ä¶ In 1912, after all these successes abroad, he returned to France and was appointed professor of lyric declamation at the Conservatoire where his results turned out to be excellent with students who won all the first prizes. But on 26 November 1916, this new career came to a sudden halt when he collapsed during a mass in the . Sal√©za married in 1895 to Pauline Bonnecarr√®re (1875‚Äì1953) and had three children: Mylio (1896‚Äì1957), Madeleine (1899‚Äì1913), and Jos√© (1905‚Äì?). He died on 26 November 1916 in the 17th arrondissement of Paris. == Legacy == An Albert Sal√©za fund was created from 21 handwritten notebooks relating the career of the French tenor, excerpts from press articles and photographs, all from the collection of Mylio Sal√©za (for photographs) and his wife Marie-Louise, who kept the memory of her father-in-law until her death in 1995. == Sources == * Albert Sal√©za dans Th√©odore Baker: Biographical Dictionary of Musicians (page 806) * Biographie d'Albert Sal√©za pour le fonds Sal√©za == References == == External links == * Biographie dans Bien Vivre √† Bruges Capbis Mifaget / Les trois villages * Festival Albert Sal√©za * Albert Sal√©za, tenor 1899 Bettini Cylinder on YouTube Category:1867 births Category:1916 deaths Category:People from Pyr√©n√©es- Atlantiques Category:Conservatoire de Paris alumni Category:Academics of the Conservatoire de Paris Category:French operatic tenors ","title":"Albert Sal√©za"},{"id":"56574778","text":"Fazil Fanoos (born 6 October 1997) is an Indian cricketer.

Strabops is known from a single specimen from the Late Cambrian (Furongian age) of the Potosi Dolomite, Missouri, collected by a former professor, Arthur Thacher. It is classified in the family Strabopidae of the monotypic order Strabopida, a group closely related to the aglaspidids with uncertain affinities. The generic name is composed by the Ancient Greek words œÉœÑœÅŒ±Œ≤œåœÇ, meaning \\"squinting\\", and ·ΩÑœà·øêœÇ, meaning \\"face\\" (and therefore, \\"squinting face\\"). The history of Strabops has been turbulent and confusing since its original description by Charles Emerson Beecher, who classified it as a eurypterid. Many authors do not agree with this and have classified Strabops and its allies as part of the Aglaspidida order, while others classify them in their own order. Although the latter is the taxonomic position currently accepted, other paleontologists prefer to simply omit the strabopids from their analyzes due to the poor preservation of their fossils. In addition, it has been suggested that the closely related Paleomerus represents a synonym of Strabops, which are uniquely differentiated by the size of the telson (\\"tail\\") and the position of the eyes. ==Description== Restoration of S. thacheri As the other strabopids, Strabops was a small-sized arthropod, measuring only 11 centimetres (4.3 inches) in length. Other Cambrian arthropods reached much greater lengths, such as the gigantic anomalocarid genus Anomalocaris that surpassed . However, it was the largest of the strabopids, surpassing Paleomerus (9.3 cm, 3.7 in) and Parapaleomerus (9.2 cm, 3.6 in). Like some other arthropod groups, the strabopids possessed segmented bodies and jointed appendages (limbs) covered in a cuticle composed of proteins and chitin. The arthropod body is divided into two tagmata (sections); the anterior prosoma (head) and posterior opisthosoma (abdomen). The appendages were attached to the prosoma, and although they are unknown in strabopids (except for one undescribed specimen of Parapaleomerus), it is most likely they owned several pairs of them. Although the chemical composition of the strabopid exoskeleton is unknown, it was probably mineralized (with inorganic substances), sturdy and calcareous (containing calcium). The head of the strabopids was very short, the back was rounded and lacked trilobation (being divided into three lobes), the abdomen was composed by 11 segments and was followed by a thick tail spine, the telson. In the genus Strabops, the prosoma was short and broad, with a rounded outline. The eyes were located in the middle of the front of the prosoma. These were medium-sized, ovate and narrow, and pointed obliquely inwards (hence the name Strabops). Two spots between the eyes indicate the presence of the ocelli (light-sensitive simple eyes). In its abdomen, there were eleven segments, being the third the widest. The ends of the segments were rounded on the sides. In the posterior part of the segments, a row of tiny crenulations was visible. The first six segments were uniform in size, the three following ones were somewhat shorter and the last two were the longest. The telson was a broad, flat spine, and it rose slightly in the middle. The appendages are unknown, although it has been suggested that they be less than seven pairs (what has been considered an overestimate). Strabops differed only from Paleomerus in the position of the eyes, which were closer together and farther from the margin than in Paleomerus, and the size of the telson, being longer and narrower than in the latter. ==History of research== Size comparison of Strabops and both species of Paleomerus Strabops is known by one only well preserved specimen (YPM 9001, housed at the Peabody Museum of Natural History). It was found by Arthur Thacher, a former professor at the Washington University, in the Potosi Dolomite of the St. Francois County, Missouri. The specimen was sent to Yale University, Connecticut. The American paleontologist Charles Emerson Beecher described it as the only Cambrian eurypterid, Strabops thacheri, the generic name derived from the Ancient Greek words œÉœÑœÅŒ±Œ≤œåœÇ (strab√≥s, squinting) and ·ΩÑœà·øêœÇ (√≥psis, face) and refers to the inward turning eyes. He considered Strabops different enough from the other eurypterids to erect a new genus, although he did not assign it to any family. In 1912, the American paleontologists John Mason Clarke and Rudolf Ruedemann assigned Strabops to the Eurypteridae family, as well as affirming the possession of a twelfth segment and changing the position of the eyes from anterolateral (in the middle of the front) to lateral.Clarke, J. K., Ruedemann R. (1912) \\"The Eurypterida of New York\\" In his book Cambrian Merostomata of 1939, the American paleontologist and geologist Gilbert Oscar Raasch considered the descriptions of the joint authorship of 1912 erroneous and agreed with Beecher on all aspects of his description, except for some reservations about the ocelli. Despite its initial classification as a eurypterid, Raasch admitted that the description of Strabops concurred with the old thought of what an aglaspidid was. It is possible that Beecher was unaware of the similarity between it and Aglaspis because of the distorted illustration of the latter by the American zoologist and paleontologist Robert Parr Whitfield. Therefore, Raasch placed Strabops under the family Aglaspididae in the order Aglaspida. In 1971, the Swedish geologist and paleontologist Jan Bergstr√∂m tentatively removed Strabopidae (at that time containing Strabops and Neostrabops) and Paleomeridae (only containing Paleomerus) from the order Aglaspidida based on the fact that the head tagma was too short to accommodate the six pairs of appendages then assumed to be present in aglaspidids. Instead, he classified them in an uncertain order in the Merostomoidea class together with the emeraldellids. Ironically, Bergstr√∂m speculated that the number of pairs of appendages present in the three genera could be fewer than seven, as well as including a possible antennal segment. This is currently observed as an overestimate. A study published by Derek Ernest Gilmor Briggs et al. in 1979 has shown that Aglaspis spinifer had between four and five pairs of appendages, but not six, weakening Bergstr√∂m's argument. In 1997, Bergstr√∂m and Hou Xianguang, a Chinese paleontologist, completely removed Strabopidae (recognizing Paleomeridae as a junior synonym), as well as the family Lemoneitidae (containing Lemoneites), from the order Aglaspidida to erect a new order, Strabopida, this time suggesting a number of no more than two pairs of appendages. However, this new clade (group) remained under the similarly-named Aglaspida subclass. A year later, the British paleontologists Jason Andrew Dunlop and Paul Antony Selden eliminated Strabopida from the suborder Aglaspidida and classified them as the sister taxa of the latter based on the lack of aglaspidid apomorphies (distinctive characteristics), such as the lack of genal spines (a spine placed in the posterolateral part of the prosoma). Other authors have reinforced this argument by the trapezoidal telson form of Paleomerus and Strabops in contrast to the long styliform telson of the aglaspidids. However, some authors prefer to represent the taxonomic position of the strabopids as uncertain due to the poor preservation of their fossils. ==Classification== Reconstruction of the closely related Paleomerus hamiltoni. Some authors suspect they may represent synonyms. Strabops is classified in its own order, Strabopida, in the clade Arachnomorpha, along with Paleomerus, Parapaleomerus and potentially Khankaspis. It was described originally as the only Cambrian eurypterid, and later as an aglaspidid. It would not be until 1997 when the order Strabopida was described, but there is still doubt if the exclusion of them from Aglaspidida was really correct. The current status of the strabopids is of aglaspidid-like arthropods of uncertain affinities. Strabops shares with the other strabopids a series of characteristics that distinguish them all from the other arthropods. These are an abdomen divided into eleven segments followed by a thick spine, the telson. The head was short with sessile compound eyes. The back was rounded. Like Paleomerus, Strabops possessed prominent dorsal eyes, however, there is no evidence of this in the fossils of Parapaleomerus. The great similarity that Strabops and Paleomerus share has cast doubt on many authors about whether both genera are really synonymous or not. The Norwegian paleontologist and geologist Leif St√∏rmer described Paleomerus as an intermediate form between Xiphosura (commonly known as horseshoe crabs) and Eurypterida, only highlighting a unique feature different from Strabops, a twelfth segment. Nevertheless, a fourth specimen found in Sweden has shown that this extra segment actually represented the telson of the animal, making them virtually indistinguishable. Although this should convert both genera into synonyms, over time, more differences have been highlighted, such as the position of the eyes (closer to each other and farther from the margin in Strabops than in Paleomerus) and the size of the telson (longer and narrower in Strabops than in Paleomerus), which keeps them as separate but closely related genera. The cladogram below published by Jason A. Dunlop and Paul A. Selden (1998) is based on the major chelicerate groups (in bold, Aglaspida, Eurypterida and Xiphosurida, Scorpiones and other arachnid clades) and their outgroup taxa (used as a reference group). Strabops and Paleomerus are shown as the sister taxa of Aglaspida. Note that there are several outdated elements. For example, Lemoneites was remitted to the Glyptocystitida order of echinoderms in 2005. ==Paleoecology== The type and only known specimen of Strabops has been found in Furongian (Upper Cambrian) deposits in eastern Missouri. Strabops was at least an inhabitant of the sea, if not born in it. In addition, there are two specimens of the marine brachiopod Obolus lamborni and a poorly preserved trilobite head attached to the slab. ==References== Strabops Category:Fossils of the United States Category:Fossil taxa described in 1901 Category:Controversial taxa ","title":"Strabops"},{"id":"56574881","text":"Borchgrevinkium is an extinct genus of chelicerate arthropod. A fossil of the single and type species, B. taimyrensis, has been discovered in deposits of the Early Devonian period (Lochkovian epoch) in the Krasnoyarsk Krai, Siberia, Russia. The name of the genus honors Carsten Borchgrevink, an Anglo-Norwegian explorer who participated in many expeditions to Antarctica. Borchgrevinkium represents a poorly known genus whose affinities are uncertain. It had several unique characteristics that differentiated it from many other arthropods, such as its long parabolic (nearly U-shaped) prosoma (head), its elongated first and second segments and the presence of paired \\"ridges\\" in the surface of its third to tenth tergites (dorsal halves of the segments). Furthermore, the opisthosoma (the \\"trunk\\") of Borchgrevinkium was triangular, and its telson (\\"tail\\"), short and wedge-shaped. It was a small animal, approximately long. The only known specimen of the genus was collected in 1956 and described in 1959 by the Russian paleontologist Nestor Ivanovich Novojilov. He determined that it was a eurypterid and classified it in the family Mycteroptidae. However, its classification changed repeatedly over the years, being transferred from Eurypterida to Xiphosura and back to Eurypterida some time later. Borchgrevinkium is tentatively considered as a prosomapod, with more fossil material needed to ensure its current classification. == Description == Weinbergina opitzi, a possibly related genus in the clade Prosomapoda. Borchgrevinkium might belong to this clade as well. The size of the only known specimen of Borchgrevinkium, identified with the label PIN 1271/1, is estimated more or less at , making it a small arthropod. The prosoma was longer than wider (covering one third of the length of the animal), parabolic (nearly U-shaped) and with a length of . The eyes are not preserved and therefore, their position or shape is unknown. The prosomal appendages (limbs) are only known by the tip of poorly preserved left pairs. They were short, undifferentiated and spiniferous. The opisthosoma (the \\"trunk\\") was triangular and long. It was composed of 12 segments, with the first one being exceptionally long and forming with the second segment an \\"extension\\" of the prosoma. The genital appendage (a ventral \\"rod\\" part of the reproductive system) of Borchgrevinkium was long, spanning from its first to its second segment. The third to tenth tergites (dorsal halves of the segments) had distal (outwards-pointing) lobes on their sides that delimitated the dorsal and ventral parts of the opisthosoma. Furthermore, these tergites had on their surfaces converging paired \\"folds\\" or \\"ridges\\" that progressively narrowed to the center of the tenth tergite. These ridges were almost parallel to the lateral lobes. On the eleventh tergite, the edges were slightly curved. The pretelson (the segment that preceded the tail) had a bifid (divided into two lobes) dorsal projection. The telson (the \\"tail\\") was cuneiform (wedge-like), short and narrow, and measured . The ornamentation of the body was composed by short scales with broadly rounded edges. == History of research == In 1956, the Russian paleontologist and geologist Vladimir Vasilyevich Menner discovered a series of fossils in Devonian deposits near the Imangda River at the southwest of the Taymyr Peninsula, near Norilsk, in the Krasnoyarsk Krai (Russia, then the Soviet Union). He sent them to the Russian paleontologist Nestor Ivanovich Novojilov, who in 1959 described, among others, a specimen labelled as PIN 1271/1, which was nearly complete. It was deposited in the Paleontological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, in Moscow, where it remains. Novojilov considered it unique enough to be erected as a new genus, Borchgrevinkium, named after the Anglo-Norwegian explorer Carsten Borchgrevink for his expeditions to Antarctica. He compared it with the then xiphosuran genus Weinbergina, assuming that Borchgrevinkium was also a xiphosuran. However, the Norwegian paleontologist Leif St√∏rmer, who assisted him during his study, noticed that what Novojilov had considered to be an accidental fissure was actually part of the \\"macrosegment\\" (the first segment), finding as well the tip of the appendages after closer examination. The presence of this macrosegment convinced Novojilov that Borchgrevinkium represented a new eurypterid, and he classified it as such. In 1966, the American paleontologist Erik Norman Kjellesvig-Waering, during a study on the families and genera of the superfamily Stylonuracea, tentatively recorded an Upper Silurian occurrence of the genus Borchgrevinkium apart from the Lower Devonian one, believing that a new specimen had been found. This specimen was later named as \\"Borchgrevinkium sp.\\". In 2017, the British geologist and paleobiologist James C. Lamsdell and the Irish palaeontologist Derek Briggs found that this specimen was YPM IP 300790, collected in the Bertie Formation in the state of New York in 1967 by Samuel J. Ciurca Jr., who identified it as a new undescribed species of Borchgrevinkium after contacting St√∏rmer. Nevertheless, since this specimen was misidentified, it was redescribed as a new species of the chasmataspidid Diploaspis, D. praecursor, by Lamsdell and Briggs. The history of Borchgrevinkium soon became turbulent, being classified as a xiphosuran in 1989, and back to Eurypterida years later. Borchgrevinkium was tentatively moved by Lamsdell in 2013 to the clade (taxonomic group) Prosomapoda. == Classification == American quarter Novojilov, during his description of Borchgrevinkium, noted a certain resemblance to Weinbergina, especially for the paired \\"ridges\\" that both have on their tergites. Based on the aforementioned macrosegment, Novojilov classified the genus as a mycteroptid eurypterid and compared it to the species Mycterops matthieui and Woodwardopterus scabrosus (members of the family), without finding many similarities but still classifying Borchgrevinkium in the eurypterid group. Nowadays, however, his descriptions are considered inexhaustive and based only on the best preserved material. Nevertheless, the genus continued being considered by other authors as a eurypterid. In 1966, Kjellesvig-Waering classified Borchgrevinkium with Woodwardopterus in the family Woodwardopteridae. He based this conclusion on the similarity of the ornamentation, the shape of the prosoma and the exceptional size of the first two segments of both. In 1972, St√∏rmer questioned the affiliation of the genus in this clade and suggested that it might represent a chasmataspidid within the order Xiphosura. Following this recommendation, Victor P. Tollerton Jr. reclassified it in 1989 inside this order during his revision of Eurypterida. In 2004, the Norwegian paleontologist Odd Erik Tetlie did not support this change and transferred Borchgrevinkium as eurypterid, again in the family Woodwardopteridae with Woodwardopterus and Mycterops, but now in a different suborder, Woodwardopterina, suggesting that these arthropods actually could not represent eurypterids. The woodwardopterines were presumably united by the great elongation of the first two segments. This point of view was not approved by other researchers, and eventually Woodwardopterina was synonymized with Stylonurina and Woodwardopteridae with Mycteroptidae. In addition, Lamsdell considered the genus as needing a redescription. Nowadays, Borchgrevinkium is a highly uncertain and problematic genus. Its eurypterid nature was soon denied again in 2013, when Lamsdell placed it in the clade Prosomapoda. It encompasses all chelicerates with prosomal uniramous appendages (appendages composed of a single series of segments attached end- to-end) in the adult stage (excluding the sixth and last pair of appendages). However, the appendages of Borchgrevinkium are poorly known. Lamsdell made a note in it and in Anderella, determining that in order to consolidate the classification of both genera in Prosomapoda, new fossil material is needed. A phylogenetic analysis (the results presented in a cladogram below) conducted by Lamsdell in 2013 on the relationships within Xiphosura and the relations to other closely related groups concluded that Xiphosura, as presently understood, was paraphyletic (that is, it was a group sharing a last common ancestor but not including all descendants of this ancestor) and thus not a valid phylogenetic group. Prosomapoda was erected to include several chelicerates formerly classified mostly as xiphosurans, as well as the xiphosurans themselves and Planaterga. Borchgrevinkium was not included due to its scarce known material. == Paleoecology == The only known specimen of Borchgrevinkium has been recovered in Early Devonian (Lochkovian) deposits of the Taymyr Peninsula in Siberia, Russia. It was found alongside specimens of the chasmataspidids Dvulikiaspis menneri, Heteroaspis stoermeri and Skrytyaspis andersoni, as well as indeterminate eurypterids like Acutiramus. The lithology (physical characteristics of the rocks) of the place has been described as dark gray marls with gypsiferous and dolomitic; rich in dolomite occurrences. The fossils were collected below the Early Devonian-Middle Devonian boundary. == References == Category:Chelicerates Category:Controversial taxa Category:Early Devonian first appearances Category:Devonian animals of Asia Category:Devonian arthropods Category:Fossils of Russia Category:Fossil taxa described in 1959 Category:Lochkovian life ","title":"Borchgrevinkium"},{"id":"56574883","text":"Gaius Sulpicius Galba was a Roman senator, who was active during the reign of Augustus.

Sasha Marianna Salzmann at the Crossing Border Festival in Den Haag, 2018 Since 2013, Salzmann has been writer in residence at the Maxim Gorki Theatre Berlin, where she previously headed the Conflict Zone Arts Asylum collective at Studio –Ø, an \\"undernational network of artists, activists, authors, performers and curators who believe that aesthetics is the better ethics, art the better politics, language the most powerful force.\\" ‚ÄòThe Maxim Gorki Theatre is the ‚ÄúTheatre of the Year‚Äù,‚Äô Welt journalist Stefan Grund wrote. ‚ÄòOne reason is Sasha Marianna Salzmann who is director of the most exciting experimental theatre in Germany‚ÄîStudio –Ø.‚Äô In 2016, the verdict of German theatre magazine Die Deutsche B√ºhne was equally enthusiastic: ‚ÄòSalzmann, with her sensitive eye for the brutality of the present age and her biographical glimpses into the past, is perhaps the German-language dramatist of the moment‚Äô (Detlev Baur). Together with Max Czollek, Salzmann curated the ‚ÄòDisintegration Congress‚Äô (2016) and the ‚ÄòRadical Jewish Culture Days‚Äô (2017), two social sculptures where international figures addressed questions of contemporary Jewish identity. ‚ÄòThe Maxim Gorki Theatre used to be a post-migrant theatre,‚Äô Dirk Pilz wrote in the Berliner Zeitung. ‚ÄòNow it‚Äôs a disintegration theatre. Disintegration means: I‚Äôm not joining in.

The novel was published by Suhrkamp in September 2017. It is about twins who grow up first in a small flat in post-Soviet Moscow and then in an asylum home in provincial West Germany and, at the same time, it is the story of a Jewish family over four generations. Salzmann was awarded the J√ºrgen Ponto Foundation Prize for Literature for her debut. The jury described Beside Myself as a ‚Äòdaring and accomplished balancing act between cultural and gender identity‚Äô and ‚Äòa multifaceted panorama of generations from the Soviet Union of the twentieth century to present-day Europe.‚Äô The novel was also on the 2017 German Book Prize shortlist and in 2018 Salzmann won the Mara Cassens Prize for her ‚Äòdeeply provocative debut novel‚Äô.

It is considered one of the most abundant large squids. ==Description== S. oualaniensis are sexually dimorphic where the females tend to grow larger than the males in most cases. Dimorphism differentiation occurs in the sucker ring dentition in which different sizes occur which suggests that a feeding spectrum occurs among male and female individuals. The species has a complex population structure, comprising three major and two minor forms with different morphology, anatomy, geographical distribution, and period of spawning.Chembian, A.

Family Ommastrephidae. In: Jereb, P. and Roper, C.F.E. (eds), Cephalopods of the World. An annotated and illustrated catalogue of species known to date, , pp. 269-347. FAO, Rome. The medium form is characterized by a dorsal photophore patch and fused mantel locking apparatus, it is the most common or ‚Äútypical‚Äù form, and has the largest geographical distribution divide with a deeper vertical distribution when compared to the dwarf form.Sn√øder, R. (1998). Aspects of the biology of the giant form of Sthenoteuthis oualaniensis (Cephalopoda: ommastrephidae) from the Arabian sea. Journal of Molluscan Studies, 64(1), 21‚Äì34. https://doi.org/10.1093/mollus/64.1.21 The dorsal mantel length (ML) of sexually mature adult males and females is 120 ‚Äì 150 mm and 190 ‚Äì 250 mm respectively. The smaller forms include a dwarf from an early maturing form, these two forms can be classified under the same category due to significant similarities as there is some disagreement in the literature. The smaller forms have no dorsal photophore patches and tend to reside in the equatorial waters (10 ‚Äì 15 ¬∫ N and S) of the Indonesian-Pacific Oceans, in which it spends the majority of its life in the upper mixed layers. The ML in the adult's males and females is 90 ‚Äì 100 mm and 90 ‚Äì 120 mm respectively. The giant forms are categorized by a dorsal photophore with a single lateral axis on the gladius and fused locking apparatus its distribution includes the Red Sea, the Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Aden northward of approximate 12 ¬∫ N, to our knowledge a few mature adult females were recorded in the equatorial region of having an ML of 725 and 820 mm, whereas in the Arabian Sea an adult female had an ML of 300 ‚Äì 500 mm. The different size forms can be explained by phenotypic plasticity due to environmental conditions.Staaf, D. J., Ruiz- Cooley, R. I., Elliger, C., Lebaric, Z., Campos, B., Markaida, U., & Gilly, W. F. (2010). Ommastrephid squids Sthenoteuthis oualaniensis and Dosidicus gigas in the eastern Pacific show convergent biogeographic breaks but contrasting population structures. Marine Ecology Progress Series, 418(January 2019), 165‚Äì178. https://doi.org/10.3354/meps08829 ==Distribution and habitat== The species occurs in a diverse range of environments in the tropical and subtropical Indo-Pacific, at depths from the surface to more than deep.Liu, B. L., Chen, X. J., Li, J. H., & Chen, Y. (2016). Age, growth and maturation of Sthenoteuthis oualaniensis in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean by statolith analysis. Marine and Freshwater Research, 67(12), 1973‚Äì1981. https://doi.org/10.1071/MF14427 Total species biomass has been estimated at between 8 ‚Äì 11 million tonnes; the Arabian Sea from November to January is thought to have one of the highest concentrations (12 to 42 t km‚àí2) due to population dynamics. == Feeding habits == Purpleback flying squids, which are thought to be both predators and prey, they are considered to be both because throughout their life they are constantly changing with continuous body size increases making them fulfill different trophic levels on the taxonomic and ecological spectrum in consideration of their food organisms, enemies, and parasites. They feed utilizing a beak which is a hard structure that contains composites of proteins and chitin fibres.Fang, Z., Xu, L., Chen, X., Liu, B., Li, J., & Chen, Y. (2015). Beak growth pattern of purpleback flying squid Sthenoteuthis oualaniensis in the eastern tropical Pacific equatorial waters. Fisheries Science, 81(3), 443‚Äì452. https://doi.org/10.1007/s12562-015-0857-8 Beaks are an important morphological characteristic as they can be used to identify and classify a species since they are easy to see with the naked eye and do not break down in the stomachs of predators. This feeding organ tears up and bites food, throughout the squid's life the characteristics of a beak can change due to ontogenetic states. The wing of the beak undergoes pigmentation in which is related to the stiffness or hardness of the beak, the more tanned regions are harder than the untanned regions, this pigmentation of the beak is directly linked with growth and changes in the diet. Purpleback flying squids are highly active predators as they can move through the water at high speeds, easily manoeuvre and respond swiftly to changes in their environment. When they are under distress of external factors such as predation they can reach a high speed and glide above the surface over ten meters, the cruising speed of an adult squid is between 3 to 10 km per hour, whereas their burst speed achieves greater speeds of up 35 km per hour, burst speed can be important for sudden changes in movement and escape behaviour. They can exist into shoals from 2 individuals to 800 individuals, and in some cases where geographical distributions overlap they can exist with similar- sized schools of Dosidicus gigas and Ommastrephes bartramii. The diet of purpleback flying squids is dependent on the size of their mantle length, in young squids or paralarva they tend to feed on predominately on micro- and mesozooplankton which include copepods and amphipods and many others. Juveniles or post-paralarvae can feed on meso- and macroplanktonic invertebrates, which include mainly copepods, euphausiids, amphipods, and chaetognaths as well as micronekton fishes (mainly myctophids) and squids, their mantel length cane range between 10 to 80 mm. As they get larger and increase in size their preference shifts towards larger fishes and squids and even other purpleback flying squids, as cannibalism is fairly common in this species. == Predators == Purpleback flying squids are predated upon by many types of species as this occurs throughout their life as they increase in size and get larger. Paralarvae and juveniles tend to get eaten by larger animals that include chaetognaths, jellyfishes, small squids, planktivorous, and small carnivores teleosts. Juveniles that have a mantle length of 3 to 12 mm are preyed on by large squids of the Humboldt squid Dosidicus gigas, dolphinfishes Coryphaena hippurus, C. equisetis, the snake mackerel Gempylus serpens, the lancet fish Alepisaurus ferox and many species of tuna. Many species of sea birds also predate on juvenile and smaller squids in which occur mostly in the oceanic regional islands. The predators of the medium to large-sized purpleback squids include swordfishes Xiphias gladis, striped marlins Tetrapterus audax, many species of different sharks, for instance, the blue shark Prionace glauca, the dusky shark Carcharhinus obscurus, the oceanic whitetip shark Carcharhinus logimanus, the smooth hammerhead shark Sphyrna zyganea and species, the sperm whale Physeter macrocephalus, and the Galapagos fur seal Arctocephalus galapagoensis. == Reproduction == Purpleback squids are thought to have a life span of up to 1 year, however in much larger squids the life span in unknown.Xinjun, C., Bilin, L., Siquan, T., Weiguo, Q., & Xiaohu, Z. (2007). Fishery biology of purpleback squid, Sthenoteuthis oualaniensis, in the northwest Indian Ocean. Fisheries Research, 83(1), 98‚Äì104. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2006.09.005 The spawning strategy of these squids is an oceanic type which is a similar characteristic across the subfamily Ommastrephinae. S. oualaniensis is a monocyclic r-strategist, the potential fecundity is dependent on the form type of the squid which can range from 0.3 to 22 million. There are no pre-mating rituals as the overall mating system of purpleback squids tends to be polygynous to polyandrous. Mating tends to occur in the surface waters at night where the squids mate in the ‚Äúmale-parallel‚Äù or the ‚Äúhead to head‚Äù positions to increase the likelihood of successful mating. The overall duration of mating is short as it can last up to 2 minutes, successful copulation's can produce up to 150 spermatangia which are then attached to the buccal cone and the membrane of the females. Specific to this species is the spawning periods that take place year around where the length of the season can last up to 3 months for female individuals. The peak season is also dependent on the form type of the squid, spawning takes place near the epipelagic zone at night, while spawning occurs in intervals (up to 10 cycles) rather than continuous time, where multiple batches can occur within one spawning period. After spawning is completed the large, pelagic, gelatinous, egg masses will float to the surface above the upper pycnocline layer, the females will remain to feed and grow while the remaining oocytes are matured and the next spawning interval is ready. The duration of embryonic development is dependent on water temperature. For example, if development occurs at a water temperature of 25 ¬∞C it takes approximately 3 to 6 days. The egg size can range from 0.75 to 0.9 mm, whereas the hatchling size is approximately 1.0 mm mantle length. Purpleback squids are known to be one of the fastest-growing squid species as the daily increase of overall length in the dwarf and middle-sized forms are about 1.0 mm, whereas, the giant form is about 3.8 mm. Once embryonic development is completed is it characterized by a paralarvae stage which is unique to octopuses and squids, paralarva is also known as the rhynchoteuthion stage which is identified by the tentacles fusing to form a trunk-like proboscis which have a few suckers on the distal tip. When this stage is completed it is signified by a separation of approximately 7.0 to 8.0 mm in mantle length. ==References== Category:Squid Category:Molluscs of the Pacific Ocean Category:Gliding animals Category:Marine molluscs of Africa Category:Cephalopods described in 1830 ","title":"Sthenoteuthis oualaniensis"},{"id":"56575075","text":"Iona Sara Macintyre McDonald OBE (b 18 November 1954) has been Lord Lieutenant of Ayrshire and Arran since 2017.

One of the main concerns of the Indian economy during the BJP government has been increasing employment opportunities for the huge number of youth entering the work force. It is estimated that over one million new people join the work force every month in India while the economy added approximately half a million formal jobs in the whole of the previous year. Pakodanomics was also a result of demonetization which was the sudden banning of 86% of currency in India in November 2016 that led to major economic upheaval .

The first series was broadcast in early 2019. It stars Steve Coogan as the inept broadcaster Alan Partridge in a spoof of current affairs programmes such as The One Show and Good Morning Britain. After a series of productions with Sky, This Time was the first BBC Alan Partridge production since I'm Alan Partridge ended in 2002. Partridge's co-host is played by Susannah Fielding, and Tim Key and Felicity Montagu reprise their roles as Simon Denton and Partridge's assistant Lynn Benfield respectively. The series received generally favourable reviews. On 15 February 2020, it was confirmed the show had been commissioned for a second series, set to air later in the year. == Premise == Partridge, played by Steve Coogan, becomes the stand-in presenter of This Time after the regular co-host falls ill. According to The Guardian, the show features \\"Partridgean tirades on everything from hand hygiene (leading him to lurk outside the BBC toilets doing spot-checks on colleagues) to hacking\\". ==Production== Partridge, an inept broadcaster, was created in 1991 by Coogan and Armando Iannucci. Following early Partridge shows such as Knowing Me, Knowing You and I'm Alan Partridge, produced by the BBC, This Time is the first BBC Partridge project following several Sky productions. It was produced by Baby Cow Productions, written by Coogan and the Gibbons brothers, directed by the Gibbons brothers, and produced by Ted Dowd. Coogan felt it was the right time for Partridge to return, and that he might represent the views of Brexit voters. Neil Gibbons said the world of live television presenting had changed since the character's inception: \\"If someone fluffed a line or got someone‚Äôs name wrong or said something stupid, it was mortifying. But nowadays, those are the sort of people who are given jobs on TV.\\" He likened Partridge to presenters such as Piers Morgan, and said that Morgan had been hired to present Good Morning Britain because he said offensive things. Coogan and the Gibbonses ignored this because \\"if you put Alan in a world where his crass buffoonery is part of the selling point, there's nowhere for him to fall\\". ==Reception== This Time with Alan Partridge has received mostly positive reviews. Lucy Mangan of The Guardian wrote that \\"the differentiation of This Time With Alan Partridges layers and escalation of every exchange is precision-engineered: beautiful things and a joy forever.\\" Tim Glanfield of Radio Times felt it was \\"some of the best Alan Partridge ever made\\". Sean O'Grady of The Independent gave it five stars, and found it \\"a consistently strong creative achievement\\". The segment with Steve Coogan as Martin Brennan (the Irish Alan Partridge lookalike) was described by Raidi√≥ Teilif√≠s √âireann as \\"TV moment of the year\\", which would be remembered \\"in the canon of truly great Partridge moments.\\" Hugo Rifkind of The Times was less positive, saying \\"Only very occasionally does it soar into unexpected places. Still, for a character that came along a quarter of a century ago and still isn't old, maybe fresh delights are a bit too much to ask.\\" Writing for Prospect, Lucinda Smyth argued \\"This Time is... OK. But it is not the best of British television, it's not even the best of Coogan, and it undermines both to say so... I don't mean to say that there haven't been a few gems in This Time. But overall the timing is patchy, the belly-laughs are few, and the script is tiringly Alan-centric.\\" Television host and former newspaper editor Piers Morgan, who is spoofed by This Time, said that \\"Steve Coogan is trying to exact revenge on me because he now hates everything to do with newspapers... I used to love Alan Partridge, he used to be hilarious, brilliant. It is now utterly unwatchable. Because Coogan has disappeared up his derri√®re, unfortunately.\\" ==Cast== *Steve Coogan as Alan Partridge *Susannah Fielding as Jennie Gresham *Tim Key as Simon Denton *Lolly Adefope as Ruth Duggan *Felicity Montagu as Lynn Benfield *Alex Dee as Floor Manager ==Guest appearances== Episode 1 https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8035404/?ref_=ttep_ep1 *Emily Maitlis as herself *Cariad Lloyd as Alice Fluck *Priyanga Burford as Jean Chaudhary Episode 2 https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9789982/?ref_=ttep_ep2 *Peter Wight as John Baskell *Simon Farnaby as Sam Chatwin Episode 3 https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9789982/?ref_=ttep_ep3 *Jonathan Watson as Dale Daniels Episode 4 https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9789982/?ref_=ttep_ep4 *Monty Don as himself Episode 5 https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9789982/?ref_=ttep_ep5 *Ellie White as Dee Gilhooly ==Episodes== ==ReferencesCategory:2019 British television series debuts Category:2010s British satirical television series Category:2020s British satirical television series Category:BBC satirical television shows Category:British parody television series Category:English-language television shows Category:Television series about television Category:Fictional television shows ","title":"This Time with Alan Partridge"},{"id":"56575307","text":"Marko Kilp (born 1 November 1993) is an Estonian cross-country skier.

The museum was founded as the Provincial Museum of Antiquities and Fine Arts in 1846 by the Provincial Monument Commission, and is therefore one of the oldest museums in Catalonia.

In 1836 it was abandoned by the community of Benedictine monks who lived there, due to the Ecclesiastical Confiscations of Mendiz√°bal.

The main house has 10 bedrooms, 12 bathrooms and 6 reception rooms. The estate includes 25 acres of mature gardens, cottages, stables and a large dower house. Park Close was owned in its early years by the civil engineer and politician Urban Hanlon Broughton as his summer residence. In 1930, his widow Mrs Urban H. Broughton was still living there and at 37 Grosvenor Square, London. In 1949, it was home to Norman Greenlees Weir. In 2004, it was bought for ¬£8 million, by \\"resolutely anonymous\\" owners, but they apparently never moved in or did any work on the house, except to rename it as Windsor Court. In April 2016, it was listed for sale at ¬£19.9 million, having been reduced from ¬£25 million. As of June 2020 it is listed for sale at ¬£15,999,950. According to The New York Times, the house, which is in need of extensive and costly restoration work could be saved, but is \\"more likely to be knocked down and replaced\\". ==References== Category:Country houses in Surrey Category:Borough of Runnymede Category:Arts and Crafts architecture in England Category:Houses completed in 1900 ","title":"Windsor Court"},{"id":"56575423","text":"Belmond Las Casitas is a hotel in the Colca Valley, 180km (118 miles)http://www.go2peru.com/peru_guide/arequipa/colca_canyon.htm north of Arequipa and 8km (5 miles) from the town of Chivay, which is known for its regional market.

The Marquette West River flows successively into the townships of Huard, Buade, Poutrincourt and Cramah√©. The course of this river is located west of the Ashuapmushuan Wildlife Reserve. Forestry is the main economic activity of this valley; recreational tourism activities, second. The forest road R0212 (East-West direction) intersects the middle section of the Marquette River West. The route 167 linking Chibougamau to Saint-F√©licien, Quebec passes on the north-east side of the Normandin River and on the Northeast of Ashuapmushuan Lake. The surface of the Marquette West River is usually frozen from early November to mid-May, however, safe ice movement is generally from mid-November to mid-April. == Geography == == Toponymy == This hydronym evokes the work of life of Jacques Marquette (Laon, France, 1637 - near Luddington, Michigan, 1675). He was a Jesuit missionary and explorer. He first studied Amerindian languages, then he devoted himself to various missions including the Outaouais; in 1671, he founded the mission of Saint-Ignace, among the Wendat (Hurons), on the north shore of Michilimakinac Strait. In 1672, he met Louis Jolliet with whom he would reach the Mississippi River. He will explore this river to the present border of Arkansas and Louisiana. Wanting to start a mission with the Kaskaskias in the land of Illinois, Father Marquette reluctantly relinquishes it because of illness.

A. R. Hall, also known as the Sunfield Grand Army of the Republic Post No. 283 Hall, is a hall built for the Grand Army of the Republic fraternal organization, located at 115 Main Street in Sunfield, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. The building has been in continuous use by organizations of Civil War veterans and their descendants since its construction. ==History== The Grand Army of the Republic was organized in 1866 as a fraternal organization for Union veterans of the Civil War. Although a Michigan section was initially organized in 1867, it became inactive, and was reorganized in 1879. However, the organization quickly caught on in the state, with nearly 400 posts formed over the next 15 years. This included the Samuel W. Grinnell Post No. 283, chartered in Sunfield on October 6, 1884. The post was named after Sergeant Samuel W. Grinnell, who had died in 1883. Grinnell had seen action in the Battle of Shiloh, and later served as Sunfield's village clerk, treasurer and as a justice of the peace. The post first met in a private home, then in a room above a local blacksmith shop, then later at the Sunfield Odd Fellows Hall. By 1898, the membership had grown to 32, and the post decided to construct their own hall. Land was purchased, and in 1899 work began constructing this building. The building was dedicated on September 15, 1899. Later that year, two cannon captured in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War were put in place. The building continued to be used by the post through the first three decades of the twentieth century. However, by 1929, only two members remained, and the last member died in 1934. However, other organizations consisting of decedents of Civil War veterans have used and maintained the hall. Among these were the Women's Relief Corps #62, who used the building from 1899 to 1925 and the Samuel W. Grinnell Camp #17, Sons of Union Veterans, from 1918 to 1936. The Helen M. Edwins Tent #30, Daughters of Union Veterans of the Civil War, began using the hall in 1926, and (as of the 1980s) owned the property. the Curtenius Guard Camp #17, Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War, began using the hall in 1983, and continue to meet there. ==Description== The Sunfield G. A. R. Hall is a rectangular, single story, front-gable, clapboarded building, with a false front topped by a pressed metal cornice. Atop the cornice is a plaque with the building's construction date, 1899, and the initials G. A. R. The building has a metal roof and fieldstone foundation. The front and side walls of the hall contain two-over-two windows in plain board frames. Two cannon sit in front of the building. On the interior, the building is divided into three rooms: a small entry vestibule, the nearby cloakroom, and the main hall. A door with peephole separates the vestibule from the main hall. The main hall remains largely as furnished by the original members of the G. A. R. post, including members' chairs, weapons and medals and flags and other effects. ==References== Category:National Register of Historic Places in Eaton County, Michigan Category:Victorian architecture in Michigan Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1899 ","title":"Sunfield G.
