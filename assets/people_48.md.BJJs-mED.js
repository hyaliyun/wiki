It was built at various stages in the late 16th century to house knights of the Order of Saint John from the langue of Italy, and it originally had a Mannerist design by Girolamo Cassar and several other architects. The building continued to be modified throughout the course of the 17th century, with the last major renovation being carried out in the 1680s during the magistracy of Gregorio Carafa, giving the building a Baroque character. After the Order was expelled from Malta in 1798, the auberge was used for a number of purposes, housing a military headquarters, an officers' mess, a museum, a school of arts, a courthouse, the General Post Office and various government departments. Until recently, it housed the Malta Tourism Authority, and there are undergoing works of restoration. It is now converted to host the national collection (previously at National Museum of Fine Arts). In 2018 it became the new National Community Art Museum, MUŻA (from the Maltese acronym Mużew Nazzjonali tal-Arti). ==HistoryHospitaller rule=== Auberge d'Italie was the third Italian auberge to be built in Malta. The first auberge was built in Birgu in the 1550s, on the site of an earlier building which had been used by the Langue of Italy. Following the transfer of the capital city from Birgu to Valletta, a second auberge was built in the centre of the new city in 1570–71. This building was eventually incorporated into the Grandmaster's Palace, and the present auberge began to be built in Strada San Giacomo (now Merchants Street). The original designs of both Valletta auberges were made by the Maltese architect Girolamo Cassar. There is no documentation recording the construction of the third Auberge d'Italie, but work began in 1574 and the building was inaugurated in September 1579. When the first floor was completed, construction of the rest of the building was suspended, but it soon became clear that the building was too small. On 25 August 1582, the decision to built a second floor was taken. Master mason Gio Andrea Farrugia was responsible for the construction, but he died before the project was completed. Construction continued throughout the 1580s, and was completed in around 1595. Apart from Cassar and Farrugia, several other architects and master masons were responsible for the construction of the auberge, including the engineer Francesco Antrini. The Langue of Italy also built the Church of St. Catherine adjacent to the auberge. Construction of the church began in 1576, and it was enlarged and modified in 1683 and 1710. Side façade of Auberge d'Italie in Jean de Valette Square, which might have contained the main entrance prior to 1629 Some repairs were made in 1604 by Alessandro Stafrace, after cracks appeared in part of the Main Hall. The auberge had an entrance facing a square in South Street, but this was blocked in 1629 when the square was built up (the square was recreated in 2012 as Jean de Valette Square). Historian Giovanni Bonello suggests that this was the main entrance of the auberge, although it might have just been a side entrance. In 1649–50, a mezzanine was built beneath the Admiral's Room, and a large room at the rear of the building was converted into four shops in 1654. The archives were constructed in 1678. A major renovation of the auberge in the Baroque style began in 1680. The façade was remodelled by Mederico Blondel, and a third floor was constructed at the expense of Grand Master Gregorio Carafa. An ornate centrepiece with a trophy of arms containing a bust of Carafa was added above the main entrance. The trophy was sculpted by Raymond de La Fage out of marble taken from the ruins of the Temple of Proserpina, an ancient Roman temple in Mtarfa which had been discovered in 1613. ===French occupation and British rule=== Rear view of Auberge d'Italie from the corner of Melita and Zachary Streets The Order of St. John was expelled from Malta with the French invasion and occupation in 1798. Being located opposite Napoleon's residence at Palazzo Parisio, the auberge was converted into the French military command. After Malta fell under British rule in 1800, it was used by both the military and civil administrations. In 1888 the ground floor was used to store the notary archives and the upper floor was occupied by the Department of Work. It was converted into a Civil Arsenal. Plans to set a protestant chapel was declined. At this point the ground floor also served as the Government Printing Office, while the upper floor was also used by the Royal Engineers. It later served as the Corps Headquarters and an officers' mess until the 1920s. In the early 19th century, chemist John Davy, who was in Malta with the Army Medical Staff, established a public dispensary at the auberge for the treatment of the poor and became known as the Albergo dei poveri (Auberge of the poor). The successor of this service, the Government Polyclinics, is still referred to as il-Berġa (the auberge). In 1922, the National Museum was transferred from Palazzo Xara to Auberge d'Italie. The museum was directed by Sir Themistocles Zammit, and it was divided into archaeology, history, arts, natural history and mineralogical sections. The museum closed down during World War II, and the building received two direct hits on 7 April 1942. Part of the façade was destroyed by aerial bombardment, and the natural history collection suffered severe damage since it was located in the part of the building which was hit. Documents from the Notarial Archives were stored in the auberge's basement during the war, and some were damaged while they were there. After the war ended, the damaged parts of the auberge were reconstructed, the museum was reopened and part of the building housed a school of art. The Museums Department had to vacate Auberge d'Italie in 1954, when the building was converted into a temporary courthouse after the Courts of Justice had to vacate the war-damaged Auberge d'Auvergne due to its dilapidated state. The Criminal Court was stationed at the Auberge. ===Independent Malta=== Pillar mail box near the auberge's main entrance In January 1971, the Superior Courts of Justice and the School of Arts vacated the building after moving into a new courthouse which had been built on the site of Auberge d'Auvergne. The building was to be converted into an examination hall, but in August of that year, it was assigned to the Posts and Telephones Department. After extensive renovations, the auberge opened as the General Post Office on 4 July 1973, taking over the role from Palazzo Parisio. The auberge remained the GPO until Posta Limited opened a new complex at Marsa in October 1997. The auberge was also used by the Water and Electricity Department, the Agricultural Department and the Central Office of Statistics. In 1997, the decision was taken to convert the auberge into the offices for the Ministry of Tourism and the Malta Tourism Authority. The building was redecorated and restored, and the Ministry moved into the building on 18 March 2002. The Malta Tourism Authority moved in on 1 March of the same year. The Ministry for Tourism has since moved to new premises in 233, Republic Street, Valletta. Restoration of Auberge d'Italie in July 2016 Plans to move the National Museum of Fine Arts from Admiralty House to Auberge d'Italie began in 2013. In September 2014, it was announced that the move will occur and the new museum would be called MUŻA (from the Maltese acronym Mużew Nazzjonali tal- Arti). It is one of the projects for Valletta's title of European Capital of Culture in 2018. The Malta Tourism Authority was set to move out of the auberge to premises in Smart City during November 2016 but the move was delayed until February 2017. The auberge's façade was restored between late 2015 and July 2016. Various artistic features from the centrepiece were revealed during this time, and Carafa's bust was also restored. The building's interior is also being restored. Another considered but refuted plan was to reopen the probable original entrance, that would have had an added front staircase on Piazza De Valette. The building was included on the Antiquities List of 1925 together with the other auberges in Valletta. It is now scheduled as a Grade 1 national monument by the Malta Environment and Planning Authority, and it is also listed on the National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands. ==Architecture== The centerpiece of the façade, after the 2016 restoration Auberge d'Italie was originally built in the Mannerist style, but the building acquired a mainly Baroque character due to the 1680s renovation. The building has a rectangular plan with its rooms are built around a central courtyard, a layout typical of Italian Renaissance palazzi and Cassar's other auberges in Valletta such as Auberge d'Aragon. The courtyard contains a triumphal arch which is thought to have been designed by Romano Carapecchia. It has a symmetrical façade with an ornate Baroque centrepiece above the main entrance, containing a bronze bust of Carafa and his coat of arms, together with a marble trophy-of-arms and a Latin inscription which reads: The centrepiece is thought to have been built by the architect Mederico Blondel based on a design by Mattia Preti. The main entrance and the corners of the building are rusticated. Each of the three floors contains a set of six windows, and a cornice runs along the façade between the first and second floors. Auberge de'Italie is linked to Auberge de Castille across the street through a World War II-era underground air-raid shelter. ==Commemorative coins== Auberge d'Italie was depicted on two commemorative coins minted in 2010 by the Central Bank of Malta. The coins show the centrepiece of the building's façade on the reverse and the coat of arms of Malta on the obverse. ==NotesReferencesFurther reading== *Details on the restoration of the façade and the trophy *€5 million for MUZA in the Auberge d'Italie *Story of the Italian Langue and the Auberge *The building during the British rule ==External links== * Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1579 Category:Buildings and structures in Valletta Category:Palaces in Valletta Category:Museums in Valletta Category:Defunct schools in Malta Category:Former courthouses in Malta Category:Former post office buildings Category:Baroque architecture in Malta Category:Post office buildings in Malta Category:Limestone buildings in Malta Category:National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands ","title":"Auberge d'Italie"},{"id":"42060224","text":"Tønjum is a village in Lærdal Municipality in Vestland county, Norway.

Thirty-six issues of Marvel Classics Comics were published, 12 of them being reprints of another publisher's work. == Overview == Classics Illustrated, created by Albert Kanter, began publication in 1941 and finished its first run in 1971, producing 169 issues. Editor Vincent Fago's Pendulum Now Age Classics, published by Pendulum Press, began adapting literary classics into black-and-white comics beginning in 1973. The Pendulum series was the direct antecedent to Marvel Classics Comics — in fact, the Marvel series' first 12 issues were colorized reprints of selected Pendulum comics, with new covers. These issues featured writers like Otto Binder, Kin Platt, and Irwin Shapiro doing the adaptations; with art by Filipino artists Alex Niño, Rudy Nebres, and E. R. Cruz, among others. Issues in the Marvel Classics Comics series were 52 pages with no advertisements. Most of the titles in the series had previously been adapted in Classics Illustrated, but two new ones were added: Bram Stoker's Dracula (#9, a Pendulum Press reprint) and H. Rider Haggard's She (#24). After the first 12 reprint issues, adaptations were handled by writers like Doug Moench and John Warner (Warner was the series editor from issue #13–24). Many issues were drawn by Dino Castrillo; artists like Jess Jodloman, Yong Montaño, and Rudy Mesina also had multiple contributions. Ernie Chan was in charge of most of the early covers. Michael Golden's first work for Marvel Comics was \\"The Cask of Amontillado\\", a backup story in Marvel Classics Comics #28 (1977) adapting an Edgar Allan Poe short story. In 1984, Marvel teamed with Fisher-Price to re-issue a selection of Marvel Classics Comics titles in toy stores, packaged with a cassette tape of the book. In 2007, Marvel re-entered the literary adaptations arena with their imprint Marvel Illustrated. == Issue list  Original run (1976-1978) === # Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, adapted by Kin Platt and Nestor Redondo # The Time Machine, adapted by Otto Binder and Alex Niño # The Hunchback of Notre-Dame, adapted by Naunerle Farr and Jun Lofamia # Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, adapted by Otto Binder and Romy Gaboa & Ernie Patricio # Black Beauty, adapted by Naunerle Farr and Rudy Nebres # Gulliver's Travels, adapted by John Norwood Fago and E.

It is in length. The stream has a watershed area of 33.0 square miles. It flows through Briar Creek Township and the borough of Briar Creek. The area near the creek was originally inhabited by the Lenni Lenape and the Shawanese. European settlers arrived in the 1770s. Briar Creek has two named tributaries: West Branch Briar Creek and East Branch Briar Creek. The discharge of Briar Creek ranges from 0.06 to 50 cubic feet per second. The water temperature of the creek ranges from to . The rock in the watershed mostly consists of sandstone, siltstone, mudstone, limestone, and shale. There are Pennsylvania State Game Lands in the watershed, as well as a lake known as the Briar Creek Reservoir. In the lake, the most common species of fish is yellow perch. ==Course== Briar Creek begins where Knob Mountain, Huntington Mountain, and Lee Mountain meet in western Briar Creek Township. It flows east for a short distance before turning south through a gap in Lee Mountain, briefly descending quite steeply. The course levels out as it leaves the mountain behind and begins flowing through a valley after a short distance. It flows under Pennsylvania Route 93, leaving the valley behind. Soon afterwards, the stream picks up the tributary West Branch Briar Creek and turns southeast. After some distance, it enters the community of Briar Creek and picks up the tributary East Branch Briar Creek. The stream then turns southwest and reaches its confluence with the Susquehanna River near French Island. ===Tributaries=== East Branch Briar Creek, a major tributary of Briar Creek Briar Creek has two named tributaries: East Branch Briar Creek and West Branch Briar Creek.

The concentration of dissolved solids in the upper reaches of East Branch Briar Creek ranges from parts per to ppm, with a median of ppm. Immediately upstream of Briar Creek Reservoir, the concentration ranges from parts per to ppm, with a median of ppm. ==Geology and geography== The watershed of Briar Creek is located in the ridge and valley physiographic region. The top of Lee Mountain forms a drainage divide between the creek's watershed and another watershed. Several points along Briar Creek and its tributaries have erode with ease or moderate ease. The infiltration capacity of these points is mostly moderate to high. In the very northern reaches of the Briar Creek watershed, the bedrock is made up of sandstone. South of the sandstone layer, there is a section of the watershed where the bedrock is mudstone. In the central part of the watershed, the bedrock is siltstone. In the southern part of the watershed, the bedrock is mostly shale, including the part of the watershed in Berwick, which it has bedrock of calcerous shale. A small area north of Berwick has limestone bedrock. There are a number of types of soil in the Briar Creek watershed. One of these is the Holly Series, which is an acidic silt loam. Places in the watershed where the Holly Series is found include Briar Creek about one mile upstream of the mouth of West Branch Briar Creek, West Branch Briar Creek about upstream of its mouth, and near Briar Creek Reservoir. Another soil series in the drainage basin is the Buchanan Series, an acidic stony loam. Places it is found include Briar Creek about two miles downstream of its headwaters. The Albrights Series, a silt loam with gravel, is also found in the watershed, in such places as East Branch Briar Creek two miles downstream of its headwaters. The Chenango Series is a silt loam that occurs, among other places, in the southeastern and southern corners of the watershed. The Watson Series and the Middlebury Series (sandy and silty loams, respectively) are found in parts of the central part of the Briar Creek watershed. The Zipp Series is a somewhat acidic silt loam that occurs in places such as the Cabin Run watershed. Briar Creek is between and wide. Its tributary West Branch Briar Creek is about wide. ==Watershed== Briar Creek Reservoir in August The Briar Creek watershed has an area of . It is located in Columbia County and Luzerne County. There are six communities that are fully or partly within the watershed: Briar Creek, Briar Creek Township, North Centre Township, Orange Township, and Berwick in Columbia County and Salem Township in Luzerne County. A total of 1.04 square miles are located in Briar Creek, 16.48 are located in Briar Creek Township, 12.04 are located in North Centre Township, 0.22 are located in Orange Township, 1.24 are in Berwick, and 1.94 are in Salem Township. As compared to other watersheds with the same size and land use, the Briar Creek watershed has been given a B rating by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection. According to the Briar Creek Coldwater Conservation Plan, this indicates that \\"residents in the watershed are working to improve and/or conserve resources in the area\\". A total of 8678 acres, or 41% of the Briar Creek watershed is forested land. Much of this is on Knob Mountain or belongs to the Pennsylvania State Game Lands Number 55. A total of 7210 acres, or 34% of the watershed, is farmland and 1143 acres, or 6% of the watershed, is urban land. Most of this is in the southeastern part of the watershed. A total of 3984 acres, or 19% of the land in the watershed, is non- agricultural grassland. There are approximately of streams in the Briar Creek watershed. The watershed is made up of seven smaller watersheds, or sub- watersheds. A 53-acre lake known as the Briar Creek Reservoir is also situated on a tributary to Briar Creek. The lake, which is manmade, was constructed for flood control purposes in the early 1970s. It is also used for fishing and boating. ==History and etymology== Briar Creek was historically known as the \\"Kawanishoning\\" to the area's Native Americans. This name was a Lenni Lenape word for \\"sweet briar\\". However, the creek was also referred to as \\"Kawanishoning Creek\\" by white soldiers and explorers during the time of the American Revolutionary War. By 1770, some maps began referring to the creek as Bryar Creek, which became the more common name by the end of the eighteenth century and remained so as late as 1840. However, the spelling gradually changed to Brier Creek and then Briar Creek. Up to approximately 1770, the area around Briar Creek was inhabited by the Lenni Lenape Indians. They built villages on the banks of the creek. The Shawanese also had a village at the mouth of the creek. In the 1770s, European settlers arrived in the area. The White family from New Jersey was among the first families of settlers to arrive in the Briar Creek valley. The Briar Creek area was one of the first places in Columbia County to be settled, on account of the high level of fertility of the land. The area around Briar Creek was part of Northumberland County in the late 1700s. In 1799, Samuel Ely was granted a patent from the state of Pennsylvania for 307 acres of land on Briar Creek known as \\"Manheim\\". In 1806, he gained a 426-acre tract of land on the creek. This tract was known as \\"Quincy\\". Ely's four sons inherited the land. In the beginning of the 1800s, a number of mills were built on tributaries of the creek. A number of other industries were established in the watershed in the early 1800s, including a sawmill, a woolen mill, an iron furnace, and a tannery. In the second half of the 1800s, railroads began to be built in the watershed. Heavy industries and fisheries also began to appear in the area around this time. By 1911, two dams had been constructed on Glen Brook (a subtributary of Briar Creek) in Briar Creek Township two miles north of Berwick. In 1911, the first dam, known as Number One, had a capacity of 15 million gallons. The second dam, known as Number Two, had a capacity of 7.5 million gallons. In 1911, a third dam was under construction several hundred feet downstream of the two aforementioned dams. It was intended to have a capacity of 23.8 million gallons. The Briar Creek Watershed Association is a watershed association for Briar Creek. It was formed in 2006. ==Biology== Pennsylvania State Game Lands#55 are in the Briar Creek watershed. The Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources has designated the Briar Creek watershed as \\"place of ecological importance\\". More than 90 species of birds breed within the Briar Creek watershed. These include several species of ducks, flycatchers, herons, plovers, rails, and swallows, as well as one species of kingfisher and one species of crane. Bald eagles, sandhill cranes, and several species of waterfowl have been observed on Briar Creek Reservoir. Mammals living in the watershed include minks, muskrats, and short-tailed shrews, and the endangered Indiana bat. Fish, damselflies, mayflies, and other macroinvertebrates also inhabit the watershed. A total of 28 species of fish were observed by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission in the watershed in 2006. Earlier, 34 species were observed. In April 2010, the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission performed a survey of the fish species residing in Briar Creek Reservoir. The most common fish observed were yellow perch (645 specimens), brown bullhead (322 specimens), golden shiner (319 specimens), white crappie (216 specimens), hatchery trout (153 specimens), and bluegill (121 specimens). The largest fish observed were common carp, of which two specimens between and were observed. The smallest fish were pumpkinseed, of which 12 specimens between two and four inches (five and ten centimeters) were observed. Minnows also live in West Branch Briar Creek. ==Recreation== Sign for the Briar Creek Lake Park Briar Creek Reservoir is located in the Briar Creek watershed, on East Branch Briar Creek. It is owned by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission and Columbia County. It was originally constructed to control floods, but most recreational activities in the watershed take place at this lake. These include fishing, picnicking, and weddings. There are also Pennsylvania State Game Lands in the watershed. The waters of Briar Creek are approved trout waters and the stream is stocked with trout. ==See also== *Tenmile Run, next tributary of the Susquehanna going downstream *Nescopeck Creek, next tributary of the Susquehanna going upstream *List of rivers of Pennsylvania ==References== Category:Rivers of Columbia County, Pennsylvania Category:Tributaries of the Susquehanna River Category:Rivers of Pennsylvania ","title":"Briar Creek (Susquehanna River tributary)"},{"id":"42060387","text":"Stephanie Ruhle Hubbard (born December 24, 1975) is the NBC News Senior Business correspondent and anchor of MSNBC Live with Stephanie Ruhle and Velshi & Ruhle.

The squadron did not receive its first aircraft until 15 January 1938, when 15 P2Y-3 seaplanes were transferred from VP-4. One, possibly two, PBY-1 aircraft were also part of the squadron complement for conversion training when more of the Catalinas became available.

Upon completion of the fleet exercises the squadron returned to Seattle. *15 September 1938: VP-18 was transferred from NAS Seattle to NAS San Diego, California, still under the operational control of Patrol Wing 2. *4 November 1938: The squadron's aging P2Y-3 seaplanes and PBY-1 aircraft were turned in for 12 replacement PBY-4 seaplanes fresh from the factory. During this period the squadron was also assigned an O3U-3 Corsair for utility purposes. *5 September 1939: VP-13 flew a trans-Pacific from San Diego to NAS Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, it new permanent home base. At that time, the squadron operated with a complement of 14 PBY-4 aircraft. *9 April 1940: The squadrons of Patrol Wing 2 participated in Fleet Exercise XXI with the Army's 72nd Bombardment Squadron and 4th Reconnaissance Squadron in the defense of the Hawaiian Islands against attack by the opposing forces. Deficiencies in coordination between Army and Navy squadrons were noted, particularly in the area of communications. *16 December 1940: VP-26 was redesignated VP-102 and relocated from its home base at Pearl Harbor to Cavite, Philippines. The relocation placed the squadron under the operational control of Patrol Wing 10, Asiatic Fleet. *8 December 1941: VP-101 and VP-102 of Patrol Wing 10 were dispersed to the southern Philippines upon notification that hostilities had commenced. They were accompanied by tenders , , and . *14–23 December 1941: Seven VP-102 aircraft were destroyed at Olongapo seadrome, Philippines, during a surprise attack. The remaining aircraft joined the two surviving VP-101 aircraft at Cavite, Philippines, in a move to Balikpapan, Borneo, arriving on 18 December 1941. Combat attrition reduced the numbers of available Patrol Wing 10 aircraft, requiring the merger of VP-101 assets into VP-102 at Ambon on 23 December 1941. *26 December 1941: The six remaining aircraft of Patrol Wing 10 carried out an attack on a Japanese surface formation near Jolo, Philippines. Two aircraft returned to Ambon Island after the action. Some of the survivors from three of the aircraft shot down during the attack were later able to rejoin the squadron in Australia. *14 February 1942: The remnants of Patrol Wing-10, a total of four PBYs out of the original 45 aircraft, assembled at the port of Darwin, Australia, after fighting rear-guard actions from Ende, Flores Island, and Kupang, Timor Island. On this date an attack by Japanese fighters on the port destroyed one more PBY-4 in the harbor. *March–7 April 1942: The last three surviving Catalinas of Patrol Wing 10 were flown to Perth, Australia. Sixty percent of the wing personnel were either dead or captives of the Japanese. On 7 April 1942, the Patrol Wing was reinforced by VP-21 from Pearl Harbor. *18 April 1942: VP-102 was disestablished at Perth, Australia. ==Home port assignments== The squadron was assigned to these home ports, effective on the dates shown: * NAS Seattle – 1 September 1937 * NAS San Diego – 15 September 1938 * Naval Station Pearl Harbor – 5 September 1939 * Naval Station Cavite – 16 December 1940 ==Aircraft Assignment== The squadron first received the following aircraft on the dates shown: * P2Y-3 – January 1938 * PBY-1 Catalina – January 1938 * PBY-4 Catalina – November 1938 * O3U-3 Corsair – November 1938 ==See also== * Maritime patrol aircraft * List of inactive United States Navy aircraft squadrons * List of United States Navy aircraft squadrons * List of squadrons in the Dictionary of American Naval Aviation Squadrons * History of the United States Navy ==References Category:Patrol squadrons of the United States Navy Category:Wikipedia articles incorporating text from the Dictionary of American Naval Aviation Squadrons ","title":"VP-102"},{"id":"42060490","text":"\\"Just One More Kiss\\" is a 1983 Renée and Renato song.

He was the resident engineer of the Order of St. John, and was admitted into the Order in 1569. He was involved in the construction of Valletta, initially as an assistant to Francesco Laparelli, before taking over the project himself. He designed many public, religious and private buildings in the new capital city, including Saint John's Co-Cathedral, the Grandmaster's Palace and the auberges. He was the father of Vittorio Cassar, another architect and engineer. ==Biography== Cassar's date of birth is not known, but he is believed to have been born in around 1520 in either Birgu or Gudja. The Cassar family, probably originating from Sicily, had been established in Malta since at least the year 1440. He had two brothers, named Andreas and Ians, and married his wife Mathia in the early 1560s after which they had five children -two boys, Vittorio and Gabriele; and three girls, Marietta, Battistina and Caterinella. Cassar had another child, Gio Domenico, from an extra-matrimonial relationship which he made sure to inherit none of his will and testament, ironically justifying himself by writing that his son was disobedient. De uxore proxima futura magistri Hieroniymi Cassar : new light on Girolamo Cassar's immediate family / J. Abela. Melita Historica. 14(2007)4(375-386) Cassar was initially a capomastro (master builder), and he was a pupil of Evangelista Menga, the resident engineer of the Order of St. John. He worked as a military engineer during the Battle of Djerba in 1560 and the Great Siege of Malta in 1565. During the latter siege, he worked on repairing fortifications damaged by the Ottoman assaults, sometimes at great personal risk. In 1566, the Order decided to construct a new capital city Valletta, and Cassar became the assistant of Francesco Laparelli, the Italian military engineer who had been sent to design the city's fortifications and grid plan. On 22 April 1569, Cassar was received within the Order in recognition of his merits as an architect and engineer. At this point, the Grand Master issued him a passport and Cassar spent the rest of the year touring Italian cities, including Naples, Rome and Lucca. He became familiar with the Mannerist style during this tour, and he employed this style in many of his later buildings. Auberge d'Aragon, the only auberge which still retains Cassar's original design, with the only addition being a 19th-century portico Upon his return to Malta in around late 1569, work on the Valletta fortifications was almost completed, and he took over the project after Laparelli left the island. He also became the Order's resident architect and engineer. He designed many public, religious and private buildings within the city, including the Grandmaster's Palace, the seven original auberges and the Conventual Church of St. John (now known as Saint John's Co-Cathedral). Cassar also designed a few buildings outside the capital city, most notably the Verdala Palace in Buskett. The original design of the Sacra Infermeria is also attributed to him. The date and circumstances of Cassar's death are not recorded. He made his second will on 9 January 1589. He is believed to have died in around 1592 in Valletta. He was buried in the Church of Porto Salvo in the same city. ==Buildings attributed to Cassar== Saint John's Co-Cathedral Verdala Palace Church of St. Mark in Rabat The following is a list of buildings which are known to have been designed by Girolamo Cassar or are attributed to him: ;Valletta *Fortifications of Valletta (1566 onwards; with Francesco Laparelli) *Church of Our Lady of Victory (1566–67) *House of Fra Eustachio del Monte (1569) *First Auberge de France ( 1570) *Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel ( 1570) *First Auberge d'Italie (1570–71) *Auberge d'Aragon (1571) *Auberge d'Allemagne (1571–75) *Auberge d'Auvergne ( 1571–83) *Auberge de Provence (1571–75) *Church of St. Dominic (1571) *Church of St. Augustine (1571–96) *Church of St. Mary of Jesus and adjoining convent (1571–75) *Saint John's Co- Cathedral (1572–77) *Auberge de Castille (1573–74) *Second Auberge d'Italie (1574–79) *Grandmaster's Palace (1574) *Sacra Infermeria (1574) *Church of St. Catherine of Italy (1576) *Monastery of St. Catherine (1576) *Carmelite convent (1576) *Church of St. Paul's Shipwreck (1577–82) *Bakery ( 1584) *Second Auberge de France ( 1588) *Del Soccorso Chapel in Fort Saint Elmo *Windmills ;Elsewhere in Malta *Reconstruction of Birgu and Senglea (1560s) *Church of St. Mark, Rabat (1571–88) *Verdala Palace (1586) *Old convent of St. Augustine, Rabat (1588) *Old convent of St. Francis, Rabat (1588) *Capuchin convent, Floriana (1586) ==Personal life== Statue to Francesco Laparelli and Girolamo Cassar, Valletta Girolamo Cassar was married to Mattea Cassar, and they had five children: *Vittorio Cassar, probably their firstborn son, the favourite and principal heir.

The only auberge in Valletta retaining Cassar's façade is Auberge d'Aragon, with the only alteration being a portico which was added to the main doorway in the 19th century. Other buildings which retain Cassar's exterior design include Saint John's Co-Cathedral in Valletta and the Church of St. Mark in Rabat, although their interiors were altered over time.

However, this plan failed, and after several concerts guitarist Justin Broadrick and then Bullen left the group. They were quickly replaced by Bill Steer on guitar and Lee Dorrian on vocals.

Firdaus' mother, Begum Hazrat Jahaan (Tabu), was left heartbroken in her youth and disapproves of Noor's feelings to his low social status. Despite this, Noor and Firdaus grow closer until Hazrat sends Firdaus abroad for school, insulting Noor as she breaks the news. Years later, Noor (Aditya Roy Kapur) receives a prestigious art scholarship and moves to Delhi, where he encounters Firdaus (Katrina Kaif) again. By this time she is engaged to Bilal (Rahul Bhat), a Pakistani diplomat, but Noor's feelings have not changed and they begin a relationship. Despite initial friction with Noor, who by this time is a successful artist, Hazrat slowly starts to realise her mistake, but is still adamant that Firdaus should marry Bilal, and orders her against her will. A flashback of Hazrat and her lover Mufti (Akshay Oberoi), who left her pregnant and ran away with all her jewels, shows why she insisted on Firdaus marrying Bilal and let go of her love. Noor travels for an art show in London where he finds out that the art scholarship was given by Moazam (Ajay Devgn), a terrorist he saved when he was young, and not by Hazrat as he thought. Upset that he has been merely a pawn in Moazam's scheme and realizing that Hazrat has been playing him all along, Noor confronts her in London where she denies manipulating him and bursts into a fit of rage for her former lover Mufti and Noor realizes that she has been seeking redemption by breaking his heart. Noor goes back to the gallery and burns his artwork which was related to the memory of Firdaus. Another flashback of Hazrat shows that she lost her baby and Firdaus is her adopted daughter. She wakes up distraught and commits suicide. At her funeral, a grieving Firdaus opens her pendant to find Mufti's picture in it with Hazrat's and realizes that she could never get over her love for Mufti. With this realization, Firdaus decides to leave Bilal and reunites with Noor. ==CastProductionDevelopment=== In October 2013, Disney UTV announced its upcoming production Fitoor, a Bollywood adaptation of Charles Dickens' novel Great Expectations to be directed by Abhishek Kapoor with Aditya Roy Kapur and Katrina Kaif signed as the lead pair.

Before 1980 the theatrical building was liquidated and in September 1980 a construction of the new building of the Crimea regional committee of Communist Party broke ground.

By his own admission an indifferent student, Shibata diverted his childhood attention to sports (football, basketball and track) and riding horses (including rodeo) in the farming communities around Garland. Despite such distractions, he demonstrated an aptitude for mathematics and science, graduating in 1944 with solid grades from Bear River High School in Tremonton, Utah. Shibata then enrolled in the Army Specialized Training Program (ASTP) (also known as A-12) officer training program at the University of Idaho and Amherst College. He soon grew restless, however, and in January 1945, he enlisted for active duty as a U.S Army paratrooper. After jump training, he deployed to Europe in August 1945. He served post-war occupation duties in Germany for 18 months with the 82nd Airborne Division and 508th Parachute Infantry Regiment. Returning to Garland, Shibata sought an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point. While previously on active duty, he had passed an admissions examination for enlisted soldiers, but was placed on a long waiting list. In 1946, Shibata garnered a nomination from Senator Elbert Thomas. Enrolling the following year, Shibata found himself together with other Plebes (freshmen) who also had prior military service, many of whom had seen combat in World War II. Despite the homogenous racial makeup of the Corps of Cadets at that time, Shibata became friends with many of his classmates, gaining a colorful reputation as a Cadet who was “always ready for a good time.\\" He even served as best man at the wedding of a roommate who was the scion of a prominent family in the deep South. Shibata partially credited his popularity to trying out for the West Point sports (track and football) teams during his Plebe year, although injuries sidelined him during his sophomore year. Shibata graduated in 1951 with a Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering, becoming the first Asian (Japanese) American graduate of any U.S. service academy. The young Nisei’s graduation was considered to be a major milestone in breaking through racial barriers. Reader’s Digest even wrote an article profiling Shibata’s accomplishments at the academy. Class of 1951 alumni included Edwin “Buzz” Aldrin, David Manker Abshire, Frank Fischl, Robert Isaac, Edward C. Meyer, and Joseph (Joe) Clemons. Shibata commissioned into the Air Force as a 2nd Lieutenant, the Air Force Academy not having yet opened. After commissioning, Shibata declined assignment to night-fighter aircraft, believing that he would not complete the lengthy specialized training before the Korean War reached an armistice. Ultimately assigned to an F-86 (Saber) squadron with the 58th Fighter Bomber Wing, he flew 30 combat mission out of Taegu Air Force Base, Republic of Korea. He was primarily assigned to ground- attack missions and eventually served as deputy commander of the squadron. Shibata later commented that his actual combat experience turned out to be no more fearsome than the intensive flying and combat-crew training he underwent leading up to the war. Shibata’s overseas service led to some droll experiences, such as eliciting racial confusion from Taiwanese officials when he ferried jets to Taiwan (then commonly referred to as Formosa), and searching in vain for distant relatives in Japan with his limited Japanese language skills. After the war ended, Shibata served various peacetime assignments primarily in the southern part of the United States. While serving as a general’s aide, Shibata began taking classes at Emory University Law School. In 1955, Shibata decided to separate from military service (transferring briefly to the Air National Guard) to pursue a career in law. He later mentioned in an interview that he and his older brother, who was already a lawyer, were probably influenced by their late father. Shibata matriculated to the University of Southern California (USC) law school that fall. Some of Shibata's family had by then moved to the Los Angeles area, and he had Japanese American friends in the area, some of whom he had met when they evacuated to Utah during World War II due to the racial mass hysteria against Japanese Americans in California. In 1958, a chance encounter with a West Point classmate catapulted Shibata into the world of movie acting. While waiting out a rainstorm in Hollywood, he dashed into an eatery and bumped into Captain Joe Clemons, who was still serving in the Regular Army and currently assigned as the Army’s technical advisor to a United Artists production titled, “Pork Chop Hill.” The movie was based on a book by Army historian Brigadier General S.L.A. Marshall, “Pork Chop Hill: The American Fighting Man in Action,” an account of the savage ferocity of the Battle of Pork Chop Hill, which was actually a series of engagements fought toward the end of the Korean War. Some 77,000 artillery rounds, not counting small caliber gunfire, were fired during the first engagement. Clemons, who would be depicted on film by lead actor Gregory Peck, was commanding officer of K (King) Company, 7th Army, and during the first part of the battle, lost 97 out of 135 men in his company. (Years later, Clemons would command the 198th infantry brigade in Vietnam and mentor, among others, a young Norman Schwarzkopf.) At first, Clemons mistook Shibata for Lieutenant Tsugio (\\"Eddie\\" or \\"Tsuki\\") Ohashi, his old Company K executive officer who was also Japanese American, and mentioned the production’s search for the right actor to play the role. After clearing up the mistake, Clemons suggested that Shibata audition for the role.pp. 77-78 Rubin, Steven Jay Combat Films: American Realism, 1945-2010, 2nd edition McFarland, 1 Jan 1981 Shibata demurred, as he did not initially take Clemons’ suggestion seriously. However, he later contacted producer Sy Bartlett, who ultimately decided to cast Shibata despite his total lack of acting experience. Bartlett was later quoted as intentionally seeking unknowns, journeymen, and stage actors (with the notable exceptions of Gregory Peck and sports great Woody Strobe), testing over 600 actors to fill the film’s 83 speaking roles. Many of the cast would garner further fame later in their careers, including Harry Guardino, George Peppard, Rip Torn, Norman Fell, Robert Blake, Gavin McLeod, Martin Landau, Harry Dean Stanton, and Clarence Williams III. In an interview, Peck said, “This bit of casting was unorthodox even for Hollywood. We were having great difficulty getting the right person for the part. It called for someone with a certain youthful toughness and a military aura….Happily for us [technical advisor Capt Joe Clemons] discovered his former West Point classmate was attending USC.” During the production, Clemons decided to play a joke on his Air Force pilot classmate, whose accommodations during the Korean War were more comfortable than Clemons', by ensuring that Shibata wore the only actual flak jacket in the film, the other cast members wearing foam rubber reproductions. The film \\"Pork Chop Hill\\" proved a critical and commercial success, ending up as the 14th top grossing film of the year. Despite Shibata’s lack of acting experience, the New York Times praised his performance, stating that “George Shibata (who happens to be a West Point graduate) is excellent as the company's Nisei executive officer.” The movie experience prompted him to continue to pursue acting, although upon Gregory Peck's advice, Shibata completed his law studies and sat for the Bar examination. Shibata would continue taking roles as they presented themselves, later appearing in major Hollywood movies such as 1960’s Hell to Eternity (as Kaz Une) starring Jeffrey Hunter and David Janssen; 1960’s “The Wackiest Ship in the Army” (as Captain Shigetsu) starring Jack Lemmon and Ricky Nelson; 1963’s “The Ugly American” (as Munsang) starring Marlon Brando; and 1966’s “Around the World Under the Sea” (as Professor Uji Hamaru) starring Lloyd Bridges. Shibata did not accept all of the roles offered to him, however, most notably rejecting a role on “The F.B.I.” television series starring Efrem Zimbalist. The role in an episode with the working title, “Will the Real Traitor Please Stand Up?”, depicted the character of a Nisei who joined the Imperial Japanese Army in World War II and tortured U.S. prisoners of war. (The episode was re-named “The Hiding Place” and aired in 1966 on season 1 of the series.) Shibata was requested by Warner Brothers to take the role without reading the script, but Shibata insisted upon reading the script first. He then declined the role because, “the character twisted the real life person upon whom it was based. In reality, the Nisei was a 19-year-old attending school in Japan when World War II broke out. Trapped in Japan, he took a translator job in a prisoner of war camp but never committed any violence against prisoners...But in the TV script, he’s represented as a brute who is responsible for the maiming and blinding of American prisoners.\\" Director Don Medford defended the script, contending the Japanese American community was loyal to the United States and, therefore, would find a traitor in their midst to be intolerable. However, Shibata noted, “Many people don’t remember the actual case, and the younger generation doesn’t understand the background of the actual story. It’s bound to have an adverse effect on the public.\\" Meanwhile, Shibata graduated in 1958 from the USC School of Law. After completing work in his early movie appearances, he passed the California bar exam in 1959 and was admitted to the State Bar in January 1960. In late 1960, Shibata joined the District Attorney’s Office in Orange County, California. By 1963, he joined the City Attorney’s office of Huntington Beach, California. In 1964, he married and decided to stay in Huntington Beach as a community to raise his daughter and son. During his time as an Assistant City Attorney, Shibata was noted by the local press for aggressively taking on a big oil firm and housing industry attorneys on behalf of the public. By 1966, Shibata had moved into private practice, and in 1967, he accepted his final acting role for a television pilot, \\"The Hardy Boys: The Mystery of the Chinese Junk,\\" (as Ben Foy) starring Tim Matheson and Richard Gates. Shibata expressed an interest in politics and served on the Orange County Human Relations Committee, although never seriously pursued elected office. Shibata continued in the legal field until his passing in 1987. He was interned at the cemetery of his alma mater, the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, late that year. ==Filmography== {  - !

This form of art is still performed by local artists in and around Palakana, a small village in Kendrapara. Puppeteers generally form groups and travel from village to village for performing shows. Wooden dolls are tied to strings which are controlled by pulling and releasing the strings. Different expression by pulling the strings narrate tales from the Puranas and modern social life. A group of artists perform music and give background voice for the narration of stories. Considering sakhi kandhei a dying art form, Odisha Sangeet Natak Akademi is taking steps to popularize and revive it. A handful of puppeteers have taken initiatives to revive this art form. ==Puppets== Wooden puppets are used in Sakhi kandhei which have three pieces; head and the two hands with the wrists with hole in them to insert fingers. The three pieces are joined together and long sleeved dresses are used to cover the bodies. Strings are attached to the thumb, limbs and other body parts which are pulled and released to give rhythmic gesture based on the story's narratives. ==ReferencesSee also== * Kathputli (Puppet) * Puppetry Category:Odia culture ","title":"Sakhi kandhei"},{"id":"42060823","text":"Høve is a village in northwest Zealand with fewer than 200 inhabitants (2011). Høve is located near Sejerø Bay, five kilometers north of Asnæs, 17 kilometers southwest of Nykøbing Sjælland, and 25 kilometers northwest of Holbæk. The village is part of Odsherred Municipality and is in Asnæs Parish. View from Esterhøj over Høve and Lammefjorden == Høve and the surrounding nature == Høve is where the road from Asnæs meets the main road stretching from Nykøbing to Slagelse. Next to Høve at 89 meters above sea level is Esterhøj, an ancient burial mound, which has views over Sejerø Bay and much of Lammefjorden. At the top of Esterhøj is a memorial stone commemorating the Schleswig Plebiscites in 1920. In earlier times, Høve, like many other villages, had an active commercial life – there was a coop, a butcher, a baker, a painter, and even a little museum. Although these are gone, one can still buy specialty products such as stoves, curtains, and dried flowers. About a kilometer north of Høve is Høve beach. Earlier, the area down around Sejerø Bay was grasslands, where animals went to graze, but now the beach is surrounded by woods and summerhouses. Høve forest is quite small, but has a variety of conifers that were originally planted to prevent sand drifting, and beech trees on the moraine hills. The beach itself is popular swimming location. In the eastern end of the forest is a little campsite, while in the northern end, one can visit a summer restaurant. == Culture == Høve Friskole lies in the village's southern outskirts, overlooking Sejerø Bay. The school was established in 1874 by a group of parents in Høve and the surrounding region, and was inspired by the grundtvig-koldske school of thought. There are approximately 130 students at the school, which lends itself as a natural meeting place. The school's sports hall frequently doubles as a party room. The grave site of Ole Olsen, the creator of Nordisk Film, can be found a bit outside of Høve, about 100 meters west of Esterhøj. The grave is perhaps inspired by the nearby Esterhøj, as it's shaped like an ancient burial mound. However, the grave's young age is revealed, as the door on the south side provides access to a peek inside the burial chamber. Through a small window, one can glimpse the urns that hold the remains of the famous filmmaker and his wife. The grave site is most easily accessed if one parks one's bike or car at the foot of Esterhøj and takes a short journey on foot. == External links == * Høve Friskole * Høve Camping * Høve Skovpavillon Category:Villages in Denmark Category:Odsherred Municipality ","title":"Høve"},{"id":"42060831","text":"The 2014 Colorado State Rams football team represented Colorado State University in the 2014 NCAA Division I FBS football season.

The Blade of the Courtesans, back cover. ==Plot summary== \\"The grueling, century-long battle royal that plunged Japan into “an Era of the Warring States” has finally ended, and the victorious Tokugawa clan rules the freshly-united Land of the Rising Sun. The shogun will come from the Tokugawa line for more than two hundred years, right until Commodore Perry’s \\"black ships\\" force the far eastern archipelago into modernity. While the Mikado or emperor retains prestige, he is but a figurehead. It is the beginning of the Edo period. Yet, despite the onset of peace and prosperity, trouble brews in Yoshiwara, the pleasure quarters of Edo where geisha courtesans count among their clientele numerous bored samurai who are no longer called upon to fight. The issuance of a gomenjo or permit for the red-light district is threatening to occasion a momentous power struggle. The courtesans themselves have no blade of their own—not until an unspoiled young swordsman from the mountains of Higo province arrives in Edo. Raised by the late legendary Miyamoto Musashi and mysteriously sent to the capital by him, the innocent but lethal Matsunaga Seiichiro bears a secret that is hidden even from himself: he is of the imperial family. Having barely survived as ruthless purge by Tokugawa minions as an infant thanks to Musashi, the youth is now more than ready to stand his own against forces that stubbornly seek his death. But the infamous Yagyu clan that serves the shogun includes ninja as well as daylight warriors among its ranks.\\"< ==Characters (in order of appearance)== *Matsunaga Seiichiro- a samurai of good moral character and superb swordsmanship skills.

Boise State would get their second interception with four minutes left in the fourth quarter, this time by Donte Deayon who ripped the ball from receiver Geremy Davis and ran 50 yards down the right sideline for the score thus sealing a 38–21 Boise State victory. ===Louisiana–Lafayette=== {  - style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  colspan=3 First meeting } {  - align=\\"center\\" Colspan=\\"3\\" Uniform Combination - align=\\"center\\" !style=\\"\\"Helmet !style=\\"\\"Jersey !style=\\"\\"Pants } Boise State kicking an extra point. ===at Air Force=== {  - style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  2–0  2013  BSU, 42–20 } {  - align=\\"center\\" Colspan=\\"3\\" Uniform Combination - align=\\"center\\" !style=\\"\\"Helmet !FFFFFF;\\"Jersey !FFFFFF;\\"Pants } ===at Nevada=== {  - style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  27–13  2013  BSU, 34–13 } {  - align=\\"center\\" Colspan=\\"3\\" Uniform Combination - align=\\"center\\" !000000;\\" !FFFFFF;\\"Jersey !000000;\\" } ===Fresno State=== {  - style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  11–5  2013  FRES, 41–40 } {  - align=\\"center\\" Colspan=\\"3\\" Uniform Combination - align=\\"center\\" !style=\\"\\"Helmet !style=\\"\\"Jersey !style=\\"\\"Pants } Boise State during a play in which they scored a TD in the 4th quarter.

He was serving as a medic in the Army when he was assigned to an acting troupe. Manza appeared on daytime television briefly in 1963 as an original cast member of the ABC-TV soap opera series General Hospital, where he played the role of Mike Costello. Manza went on to become a character actor appearing on many primetime TV series in guest role spots, beginning in the 1950s with the TV crime/drama series Highway Patrol, and Alfred Hitchcock Presents. This part of his acting career continued to flourish through the 1960s, with appearances on such shows as 77 Sunset Strip, McHale's Navy, Perry Mason, The Twilight Zone, Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C. and Gunsmoke, continuing in the 1970s and 1980s on such series such as Get Smart, My Three Sons, Night Gallery, Police Woman, Hart to Hart, Chico and the Man, Barney Miller (in 7 episodes), Benson, Simon and Simon, Night Court, Newhart and most notably Banacek, on which he co-starred as the perpetually puzzled chauffeur Jay Drury. He went on into the 1990s, with appearances on the long-running NBC-TV sitcom series Seinfeld, CBS-TV's The Nanny and NBC-TV's Friends. Manza also made appearances in several feature films, perhaps most memorably as the actor playing Hitler in Mel Brooks' Blazing Saddles (1974) (\\"They lose me after the bunker scene.\\") and as the fisherman whose scene in the 1998 Godzilla was used as the film's first teaser. He maintained a very active career up until the time of his death. ==Death== Manza died in January 2000 in Scripps Health-Encintas Hospital in Encinitas, California of a heart attack. He had also suffered a heart attack three weeks before his death while filming a commercial for Budweiser. ==Filmography== *China Smith (1954, Episode: \\"The Manchu Emeralds\\") as Gluck *Highway Patrol (1955, Episode: \\"Phony Insurance\\") as Jenkins *Alfred Hitchcock Presents (1956, Episode: \\"Safe Conduct\\") as Waiter *Front Row Center (1956, Episode: \\"The Human Touch\\") as Second Waiter *While the City Sleeps (1956) as Newsroom Man (uncredited) *Judge Roy Bean (1956, Episode: \\"Citizen Romeo\\") as Gaspano Martini *The Lineup (1957, Episode: \\"The Juke Box Bandit Case\\") as Lineup Suspect #2 *Hey, Jeannie!

He was first elected to the Longueuil City Council as a city councillor in the 1978 municipal election, representing the city's tenth ward. The overall result of this election was inconclusive: Marcel Robidas of the rival Parti civique de Longueuil was re-elected as mayor, but the Parti municipal won nine of seventeen seats and held a functioning majority until one of its representatives was expelled from the party. Parti municipal leader Paul Viau resigned in 1981, and Jacques Finet was chosen without opposition to become his successor.Le Parti municipal de Longueuil: Le premier mandat 1978 - 1982, Société historique et culturelle du Marigot, accessed 22 February 2014. ==Mayor== Finet defeated Robidas by the narrow margin of eighty-two votes in the 1982 municipal election to become mayor of Longueuil, and the Parti municipal won a convincing majority on council. As mayor, Finet promoted a cleanup plan for the Saint Lawrence River and a related beautification project for Longueuil's waterfront.Le Parti municipal de Longueuil: Jacques Finet, l'innovateur, Société historique et culturelle du Marigot, accessed 22 February 2014; \\"Good news for St. Lawrence,\\" Montreal Gazette, 24 January 1985, B2; Harvey Shepherd, \\"Longueuil ex-mayor backs plan to widen shoreline,\\" Montreal Gazette, 15 May 1985, A3. The original project proposal would have involved constructing a sewage interceptor pipe on the river's bed for three kilometers, and for this reason the plan was opposed by local environmental groups. The plan was rejected by the government of Quebec in late 1985, and Finet instead accepted a compromise to construct most of the pipe under Quebec Route 132.\\"Quebec alters Longueuil's pipe plans,\\" Montreal Gazette, 26 September 1985, A3. The waterfront beautification project began in September 1986.\\"Longueuil riverfront project starts,\\" Montreal Gazette, 25 September 1986, C16.

The new municipal lands were intended for housing development.\\"City, firm swap land,\\" Montreal Gazette, 21 March 1985, A4.

Some criticized him for leaving politics so soon after his re- election.\\"Longueuil to vote: Mayor quits to work for Hydro-Quebec,\\" Montreal Gazette, 23 April 1987, G1; \\"Ex-federal minister bids for Longueuil mayoralty,\\" Montreal Gazette, 14 May 1987, G1.

In August 1991, Finet was appointed as Hydro-Québec's first vice-president for Europe. He indicated that his priority would be to foster a \\"high-quality image\\" for the corporation while fighting what he described as a \\"smear campaign\\" from environmental and indigenous groups over its involvement in the proposed Great Whale River project.Graeme Hamilton, \\"Hydro names Europe envoy to combat \`smears',\\" Montreal Gazette, 8 August 1991, A5. His office was located in Brussels, Belgium.\\"NOMINATION HYDRO-QUEBEC,\\" Montreal Gazette, 10 September 1991, F3. Shortly after his appointment, Finet defended Hydro- Québec's relations with Cree and Inuit communities affected by construction projects in northern Quebec. He argued that the corporation had paid $500 million in compensation for mining rights and that economic conditions and social services were improving in the affected communities. Critics charged that the construction projects created new health risks and contributed to a variety of social problems.Lisa Schlein, \\"Hydro-Quebec polishing image in Europe New office fights environmentalists' criticism over Great Whale project,\\" Globe and Mail, 20 September 1991, B4. Finet asked the International Water Tribunal to cancel a series of planned hearings on the Great Whale River project in 1992, charging that the hearings would become a media circus. Bill Namagoose, executive director of the Grand Council of the Crees, which requested the hearings, described Finet's request as spurious.Andre Picard, \\"Hydro-Quebec challenges panel Utility says tribunal's hearing on James Bay projects will be media circus,\\" Globe and Mail, 7 January 1992, B5. Shortly thereafter, Finet charged that the Grand Council of Crees was using environmental arguments as a \\"facade\\" to push for full control of natural resources. Namagoose again dismissed Finet's statement, saying that the Cree were seeking shared control of natural resources in accordance with the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement.Graeme Hamilton, \\"Cree itching to take charge of James Bay project: Hydro,\\" Montreal Gazette, 13 February 1992, A6. The International Water Tribunal ultimately issued a non-binding ruling calling for the Great Whale project to be halted pending completion of an environmental review.Graeme Hamilton, \\"Hold off on Great Whale till review is done: panel; James Bay is an \`ongoing intrusion' for Cree, international tribunal says,\\" Montreal Gazette, 21 February 1994, A4. Finet was chosen as leader of the International Union for Electroheat (UIE) at the 12th World Congress on Electrotechnologies in June 1992. He was the first North American to lead the organization.\\"UIE; The First North American as Head of the International Union for Electroheat,\\" Montreal Gazette, 22 June 1992, C4. Hydro-Québec wrapped up most of its European public relations activities in 1993, and Finet announced his retirement from Hydro-Québec at the same time. In an interview with the Montreal Gazette, he said that Hydro had built up a network of supporters in Europe and that his presence was no longer needed. At its peak in 1992, Hydro-Québec's European office spent $920,000 on public relations.Graeme Hamilton, \\"Utility calls back its man in Europe; Claims he quelled anti-Hydro campaign,\\" Montreal Gazette, 27 November 1993, A4. ==Attempted return to political life== Finet sought to return as mayor of Longueuil in the 1994 municipal election as a candidate of the newly formed Alliance de Longueuil, which was created by a de facto merger of the Alliance démocratique de Longueuil and the Parti civique de Longueuil.Technically, the Alliance démocratique changed its name to the Alliance de Longueuil, while the Parti civique voted to dissolve itself. The Parti civique had outstanding debts that would have complicated a formal merger. See Harvey Shepherd, \\"Finet wants more women on council; Plans to recruit at least six new female candidates,\\" Montreal Gazette, 5 May 1994, G4. He won the party leadership on May 1, 1994, defeating former Parti civique leader Sylvie Robidas by 601 votes to 122.\\"Ex-mayor to run again in Longueuil,\\" Montreal Gazette, 2 May 1994, A3; Le Parti municipal de Longueuil: Roger Ferland, le gestionnaire, Société historique et culturelle du Marigot, accessed 26 February 2014. His platform called for a municipal tax freeze, the creation of an economic development office, establishing an arts and cultural center to serve the South Shore, and quality-of-life committees for all the city's neighbourhoods. He also said that he would seek a merger of the Montreal Island, South Shore, and Laval transit systems, to be accompanied by a distance-based fare system. His opponents revived criticisms that he had resigned as mayor too soon after his re-election in 1986.Mike Gordon, \\"Finet vows to freeze taxes in Longueuil,\\" Montreal Gazette, 25 August 1994, E1. Finet ultimately finished third against Claude Gladu of the Parti municipal.Harvey Shepherd, \\"Gladu, Municipal Party win control in Longueuil; Finet's comeback ambitions dashed,\\" Montreal Gazette, 7 November 1994, A8.

On August 3, 2011, the NTWA made history when it became the 57th affiliate of the AFL-CIO. NTWA is the first non-traditional workforce made up of independent contractors who don’t work for an hourly wage to be granted membership into the AFL-CIO, the oldest labor federation in the country. The Executive Council of the AFL-CIO voted unanimously “to include the NTWA into the house of labor with a national unionize taxi drivers throughout the United States”. The union is made up of 200,000 taxi workers operating 100,000 vehicles serving 1 billion riders per year. ==Origins of the union== The National Taxi Workers’ Alliance emerged from the organizing efforts of the founding member, Bhairavi Desai. Desai founded the NTWA four years after graduating from Rutgers. In May 1998 Desai organized the first taxi workers strike to occur in New York City in 30 years. Over 90 percent of the taxi drivers joined the strike with a demonstration of 2,000 yellow cabs lined up at 14th Street and Avenue D. Forty thousand drivers parked their taxis and refused to work to protest the city policing of their industry. In February 1998, Desai and other organizers founded the New York Taxi Workers’ Alliance. During the 2013 AFL-CIO Convention, Bhairavi Desai, the Executive Director of the Alliance was elected to the AFL-CIO Executive Council. ==Chapters== The National Taxi Workers’ Alliance has active chapters in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, New York City, New York, and San Francisco, California. The National describes its role as helping to “embolden the local chapters”. The national officers work to strategize on key campaigns and organizing drives with the local chapters. The national chapter works to secure resources to help with membership recruitment, dues development, and institution-building. The National Taxi Workers’ Alliance’s most active chapter remains the one in New York. Over 15,000 taxi cab drivers are currently members of the NYC Chapter. More than 90 percent of NYC’s cab drivers are immigrants, belonging mostly to the South Asian diaspora from countries such as Bangladesh, Pakistan, and India. ==Long-term goals== Currently the National Taxi Workers’ Alliance does not have any collective bargaining rights as they represent a non-traditional workforce. Taxi cab drivers are not covered under the Fair Labor Standards Act which protects workers’ safety and grants overtime pay. Desai and other organizers are hopeful that the recent affiliation with AFL-CIO will help NTWA build a mass base of workers that can build their political influence and resources in order to one day win collective bargaining rights. ==References *New York Taxi Workers' Alliance materials in the South Asian American Digital Archive (SAADA) *Bhairavi Desai materials in the South Asian American Digital Archive (SAADA) Category:AFL–CIO Category:Trade unions established in 1998 ","title":"National Taxi Workers' Alliance"},{"id":"42061187","text":"John Ferrett (1812—1894) was a pastoralist and politician in Queensland, Australia.

The 1st semifinal game between Kazuhiro Nishikawa 4d (sente) and Masataka Gōda 9d (gote) was broadcast on March 2, 2014. Gōda won the game in 128 moves, thus stopping Nishikawa's NHK Cup winning streak at six. The guest analyst was Kunio Naitō 9d. The 2nd semifinal game was between Tadashi Ōishi 6d (sente) and Tadahisa Maruyama 9d (gote). The game was broadcast on March 9, 2014, and won by Maruyama in 104 moves. The guest analyst was Daisuke Katagami 6d. ===Finals=== After 112 preliminary tournament games and 48 main tournament games involving 162 players, Tadashisa Maruyama 9d and Masataka Gōda 9d met in the final broadcast on March 23, 2014. This was the second NHK Cup final appearance for both players: Maruyama defeated Akira Watanabe to win the 55th NHK Cup (2005) and Gōda was runner-up to Daisuke Suzuki in the 49th NHK Cup (1999). The piece toss before the game resulted in Maruyama being sente. Gōda won the game in 82 moves, thus winning the tournament for the first time and becoming the 63rd NHK Cup Champion.

The variance function plays a large role in many settings of statistical modelling. It is a main ingredient in the generalized linear model framework and a tool used in non- parametric regression, semiparametric regression and functional data analysis. In parametric modeling, variance functions take on a parametric form and explicitly describe the relationship between the variance and the mean of a random quantity. In a non-parametric setting, the variance function is assumed to be a smooth function. == Intuition == In a regression model setting, the goal is to establish whether or not a relationship exists between a response variable and a set of predictor variables. Further, if a relationship does exist, the goal is then to be able to describe this relationship as best as possible. A main assumption in linear regression is constant variance or (homoscedasticity), meaning that different response variables have the same variance in their errors, at every predictor level. This assumption works well when the response variable and the predictor variable are jointly Normal, see Normal distribution. As we will see later, the variance function in the Normal setting, is constant, however, we must find a way to quantify heteroscedasticity (non-constant variance) in the absence of joint Normality. When it is likely that the response follows a distribution that is a member of the exponential family, a generalized linear model may be more appropriate to use, and moreover, when we wish not to force a parametric model onto our data, a non-parametric regression approach can be useful. The importance of being able to model the variance as a function of the mean lies in improved inference (in a parametric setting), and estimation of the regression function in general, for any setting. Variance functions play a very important role in parameter estimation and inference. In general, maximum likelihood estimation requires that a likelihood function be defined. This requirement then implies that one must first specify the distribution of the response variables observed. However, to define a quasi-likelihood, one need only specify a relationship between the mean and the variance of the observations to then be able to use the quasi-likelihood function for estimation. Quasi-likelihood estimation is particularly useful when there is overdispersion. Overdispersion occurs when there is more variability in the data than there should otherwise be expected according to the assumed distribution of the data. In summary, to ensure efficient inference of the regression parameters and the regression function, the heteroscedasticity must be accounted for. Variance functions quantify the relationship between the variance and the mean of the observed data and hence play a significant role in regression estimation and inference. == Types == The variance function and its applications come up in many areas of statistical analysis. A very important use of this function is in the framework of generalized linear models and non-parametric regression. === Generalized linear model === When a member of the exponential family has been specified, the variance function can easily be derived. The general form of the variance function is presented under the exponential family context, as well as specific forms for Normal, Bernoulli, Poisson, and Gamma. In addition, we describe the applications and use of variance functions in maximum likelihood estimation and quasi-likelihood estimation.  Derivation  The generalized linear model (GLM), is a generalization of ordinary regression analysis that extends to any member of the exponential family. It is particularly useful when the response variable is categorical, binary or subject to a constraint (e.g. only positive responses make sense). A quick summary of the components of a GLM are summarized on this page, but for more details and information see the page on generalized linear models. A GLM consists of three main ingredients: :1. Random Component: a distribution of y from the exponential family, E[y \\\\mid X] = \\\\mu :2. Linear predictor: \\\\eta = XB = \\\\sum_{j=1}^p X_{ij}^T B_j :3. Link function: \\\\eta = g(\\\\mu), \\\\mu = g^{-1}(\\\\eta) First it is important to derive a couple key properties of the exponential family. Any random variable \\\\textit{y} in the exponential family has a probability density function of the form, :f(y,\\\\theta,\\\\phi) = \\\\exp\\\\left(\\\\frac{y\\\\theta - b(\\\\theta)}{\\\\phi} - c(y,\\\\phi)\\\\right) with loglikelihood, :\\\\ell(\\\\theta,y,\\\\phi)=\\\\log(f(y,\\\\theta,\\\\phi)) = \\\\frac{y\\\\theta - b(\\\\theta)}{\\\\phi} - c(y,\\\\phi) Here, \\\\theta is the canonical parameter and the parameter of interest, and \\\\phi is a nuisance parameter which plays a role in the variance. We use the Bartlett's Identities to derive a general expression for the variance function. The first and second Bartlett results ensures that under suitable conditions (see Leibniz integral rule), for a density function dependent on \\\\theta, f_\\\\theta(), :\\\\operatorname{E}_\\\\theta\\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial \\\\theta} \\\\log(f_\\\\theta(y)) \\\\right] = 0 :\\\\operatorname{Var}_\\\\theta\\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial \\\\theta}\\\\log(f_\\\\theta(y))\\\\right]+\\\\operatorname{E}_\\\\theta\\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2}{\\\\partial \\\\theta^2} \\\\log(f_\\\\theta(y))\\\\right] = 0 These identities lead to simple calculations of the expected value and variance of any random variable \\\\textit{y} in the exponential family E_\\\\theta[y], Var_\\\\theta[y]. Expected value of Y: Taking the first derivative with respect to \\\\theta of the log of the density in the exponential family form described above, we have :\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial \\\\theta}\\\\log(f(y,\\\\theta,\\\\phi))= \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial \\\\theta}\\\\left[\\\\frac{y\\\\theta - b(\\\\theta)}{\\\\phi} - c(y,\\\\phi)\\\\right] = \\\\frac{y-b'(\\\\theta)}{\\\\phi} Then taking the expected value and setting it equal to zero leads to, :\\\\operatorname{E}_\\\\theta\\\\left[\\\\frac{y-b'(\\\\theta)}{\\\\phi}\\\\right] = \\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{E}_\\\\theta[y]-b'(\\\\theta)}{\\\\phi}=0 :\\\\operatorname{E}_\\\\theta[y] = b'(\\\\theta) Variance of Y: To compute the variance we use the second Bartlett identity, :\\\\operatorname{Var}_\\\\theta\\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial \\\\theta}\\\\left(\\\\frac{y\\\\theta - b(\\\\theta)}{\\\\phi} - c(y,\\\\phi)\\\\right)\\\\right]+\\\\operatorname{E}_\\\\theta\\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2}{\\\\partial \\\\theta^2}\\\\left(\\\\frac{y\\\\theta - b(\\\\theta)}{\\\\phi} - c(y,\\\\phi)\\\\right)\\\\right] = 0 :\\\\operatorname{Var}_\\\\theta\\\\left[\\\\frac{y - b'(\\\\theta)} \\\\phi \\\\right] + \\\\operatorname{E}_\\\\theta \\\\left[\\\\frac{-b(\\\\theta)} \\\\phi \\\\right] = 0 : \\\\operatorname{Var}_\\\\theta\\\\left[y\\\\right]=b(\\\\theta)\\\\phi We have now a relationship between \\\\mu and \\\\theta, namely :\\\\mu = b'(\\\\theta) and \\\\theta = b'^{-1}(\\\\mu), which allows for a relationship between \\\\mu and the variance, :V(\\\\theta) = b(\\\\theta) = \\\\text{the part of the variance that depends on }\\\\theta :\\\\operatorname{V}(\\\\mu) = b(b'^{-1}(\\\\mu)). \\\\, Note that because \\\\operatorname{Var}_\\\\theta\\\\left[y\\\\right]>0, b(\\\\theta)>0, then b': \\\\theta \\\\rightarrow \\\\mu is invertible. We derive the variance function for a few common distributions.  Example – normal  The Normal distribution is a special case where the variance function is a constant. Let y \\\\sim N(\\\\mu,\\\\sigma^2) then we put the density function of y in the form of the exponential family described above: :f(y) = \\\\exp\\\\left(\\\\frac{y\\\\mu - \\\\frac{\\\\mu^2}{2}}{\\\\sigma^2} - \\\\frac{y^2}{2\\\\sigma^2} - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\ln{2\\\\pi\\\\sigma^2}\\\\right) where : \\\\theta = \\\\mu, : b(\\\\theta) = \\\\frac{\\\\mu^2}{2}, : \\\\phi=\\\\sigma^2, : c(y,\\\\phi)=- \\\\frac{y^2}{2\\\\sigma^2} - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\ln{2\\\\pi\\\\sigma^2} To calculate the variance function V(\\\\mu), we first express \\\\theta as a function of \\\\mu. Then we transform V(\\\\theta) into a function of \\\\mu :\\\\theta=\\\\mu :b'(\\\\theta) = \\\\theta= \\\\operatorname{E}[y] = \\\\mu :V(\\\\theta) = b(\\\\theta) = 1 Therefore, the variance function is constant.  Example – Bernoulli  Let y \\\\sim \\\\text{Bernoulli}(p), then we express the density of the Bernoulli distribution in exponential family form, : f(y) = \\\\exp\\\\left(y\\\\ln\\\\frac{p}{1-p} + \\\\ln(1-p)\\\\right) :\\\\theta = \\\\ln\\\\frac{p}{1-p} = logit(p), which gives us p = \\\\frac{e^\\\\theta}{1+e^\\\\theta} = expit(\\\\theta) :b(\\\\theta) = \\\\ln(1+e^\\\\theta) and : b'(\\\\theta) = \\\\frac{e^\\\\theta}{1+e^\\\\theta} = expit(\\\\theta) = p = \\\\mu : b(\\\\theta) =\\\\frac{e^\\\\theta}{1+e^\\\\theta} - \\\\left(\\\\frac{e^\\\\theta}{1+e^\\\\theta}\\\\right)^2 This give us :V(\\\\mu) = \\\\mu(1-\\\\mu)  Example – Poisson  Let y \\\\sim \\\\text{Poisson}(\\\\lambda), then we express the density of the Poisson distribution in exponential family form, : f(y) = \\\\exp(y\\\\ln\\\\lambda -\\\\ln\\\\lambda) :\\\\theta = \\\\ln\\\\lambda = which gives us \\\\lambda = e^\\\\theta :b(\\\\theta) = e^\\\\theta and : b'(\\\\theta) = e^\\\\theta = \\\\lambda = \\\\mu : b(\\\\theta) =e^\\\\theta = \\\\mu This give us :V(\\\\mu) = \\\\mu Here we see the central property of Poisson data, that the variance is equal to the mean.  Example – Gamma  The Gamma distribution and density function can be expressed under different parametrizations. We will use the form of the gamma with parameters (\\\\mu, u) :f_{\\\\mu, u}(y) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\Gamma( u)y}\\\\left(\\\\frac{ u y}{\\\\mu}\\\\right)^ u e^{\\\\frac{ u y}{\\\\mu}} Then in exponential family form we have :f_{\\\\mu, u}(y) = \\\\exp\\\\left(\\\\frac{-\\\\frac{1}{\\\\mu}y+\\\\ln(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\mu})}{\\\\frac{1}{ u}}+ \\\\ln\\\\left(\\\\frac{ u^ u y^{ u-1}}{\\\\Gamma( u)}\\\\right)\\\\right) : \\\\theta = \\\\frac{-1}{\\\\mu} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mu = \\\\frac{-1}{\\\\theta} : \\\\phi = \\\\frac{1}{ u} : b(\\\\theta) = -ln(-\\\\theta) : b'(\\\\theta) = \\\\frac{-1}{\\\\theta} = \\\\frac{-1}{\\\\frac{-1}{\\\\mu}} = \\\\mu : b(\\\\theta) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\theta^2} = \\\\mu^2 And we have V(\\\\mu) = \\\\mu^2  Application – weighted least squares  A very important application of the variance function is its use in parameter estimation and inference when the response variable is of the required exponential family form as well as in some cases when it is not (which we will discuss in quasi-likelihood). Weighted least squares (WLS) is a special case of generalized least squares. Each term in the WLS criterion includes a weight that determines that the influence each observation has on the final parameter estimates. As in regular least squares, the goal is to estimate the unknown parameters in the regression function by finding values for parameter estimates that minimize the sum of the squared deviations between the observed responses and the functional portion of the model. While WLS assumes independence of observations it does not assume equal variance and is therefore a solution for parameter estimation in the presence of heteroscedasticity. The Gauss–Markov theorem and Aitken demonstrate that the best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE), the unbiased estimator with minimum variance, has each weight equal to the reciprocal of the variance of the measurement. In the GLM framework, our goal is to estimate parameters \\\\beta, where Z = g(E[y\\\\mid X]) = X\\\\beta. Therefore, we would like to minimize (Z-XB)^{T}W(Z-XB) and if we define the weight matrix W as :\\\\underbrace{W}_{n \\\\times n} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\frac{1}{\\\\phi V(\\\\mu_1)g'(\\\\mu_1)^2} &0&\\\\cdots&0&0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0&\\\\frac{1}{\\\\phi V(\\\\mu_2)g'(\\\\mu_2)^2}&0&\\\\cdots&0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots&\\\\vdots&\\\\vdots&\\\\vdots&0\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots&\\\\vdots&\\\\vdots&\\\\vdots&0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 &\\\\cdots&\\\\cdots&0&\\\\frac{1}{\\\\phi V(\\\\mu_n)g'(\\\\mu_n)^2} \\\\end{bmatrix}, where \\\\phi,V(\\\\mu),g(\\\\mu) are defined in the previous section, it allows for iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) estimation of the parameters. See the section on iteratively reweighted least squares for more derivation and information. Also, important to note is that when the weight matrix is of the form described here, minimizing the expression (Z-XB)^{T}W(Z-XB) also minimizes the Pearson distance. See Distance correlation for more. The matrix W falls right out of the estimating equations for estimation of \\\\beta. Maximum likelihood estimation for each parameter \\\\beta_r, 1\\\\leq r \\\\leq p, requires :\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\frac{\\\\partial l_i}{\\\\partial \\\\beta_r} = 0, where \\\\operatorname{l}(\\\\theta,y,\\\\phi)=\\\\log(\\\\operatorname{f}(y,\\\\theta,\\\\phi)) = \\\\frac{y\\\\theta - b(\\\\theta)}{\\\\phi} - c(y,\\\\phi) is the log-likelihood. Looking at a single observation we have, :\\\\frac{\\\\partial l}{\\\\partial \\\\beta_r} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial l}{\\\\partial \\\\theta} \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\theta}{\\\\partial \\\\mu}\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mu}{\\\\partial \\\\eta}\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\eta}{\\\\partial \\\\beta_r} :\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\eta}{\\\\partial \\\\beta_r} = x_r :\\\\frac{\\\\partial l}{\\\\partial \\\\theta} = \\\\frac{y-b'(\\\\theta)}{\\\\phi}=\\\\frac{y-\\\\mu}{\\\\phi} :\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\theta}{\\\\partial \\\\mu} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial b'^{-1}(\\\\mu)}{\\\\mu} = \\\\frac{1}{b(b'(\\\\mu))} = \\\\frac{1}{V(\\\\mu)} This gives us :\\\\frac{\\\\partial l}{\\\\partial \\\\beta_r} =\\\\frac{y-\\\\mu}{\\\\phi V(\\\\mu)} \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mu}{\\\\partial \\\\eta}x_r, and noting that :\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\eta}{\\\\partial \\\\mu} = g'(\\\\mu) we have that :\\\\frac{\\\\partial l}{\\\\partial \\\\beta_r} =\\\\frac{y-\\\\mu}{\\\\phi V(\\\\mu)}W\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\eta}{\\\\partial \\\\mu}x_r The Hessian matrix is determined in a similar manner and can be shown to be, : H = X^T(y-\\\\mu)\\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\beta_s}W\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\beta_r}\\\\right] - X^TWX Noticing that the Fisher Information (FI), :\\\\text{FI} = -E[H] = X^TWX, allows for asymptotic approximation of \\\\hat{\\\\beta} :\\\\hat{\\\\beta} \\\\sim N_p(\\\\beta,(X^TWX)^{-1}), and hence inference can be performed.  Application – quasi-likelihood  Because most features of GLMs only depend on the first two moments of the distribution, rather than the entire distribution, the quasi-likelihood can be developed by just specifying a link function and a variance function. That is, we need to specify : – Link function: E[y] = \\\\mu = g^{-1}(\\\\eta) : – Variance function: V(\\\\mu)\\\\text{, where the }\\\\operatorname{Var}_\\\\theta(y) = \\\\sigma^2V(\\\\mu) With a specified variance function and link function we can develop, as alternatives to the log- likelihood function, the score function, and the Fisher information, a quasi- likelihood, a quasi-score, and the quasi-information. This allows for full inference of \\\\beta. Quasi-likelihood (QL) Though called a quasi-likelihood, this is in fact a quasi-log-likelihood. The QL for one observation is : Q_i(\\\\mu_i,y_i) = \\\\int_{y_i}^{\\\\mu_i} \\\\frac{y_i-t}{\\\\sigma^2V(t)} \\\\, dt And therefore the QL for all n observations is :Q(\\\\mu,y) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n Q_i(\\\\mu_i,y_i) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\int_{y_i}^{\\\\mu_i} \\\\frac{y-t}{\\\\sigma^2V(t)} \\\\, dt From the QL we have the quasi-score Quasi-score (QS) Recall the score function, U, for data with log-likelihood \\\\operatorname{l}(\\\\mu\\\\mid y) is :U = \\\\frac{\\\\partial l }{d\\\\mu}. We obtain the quasi-score in an identical manner, :U = \\\\frac{y-\\\\mu}{\\\\sigma^2V(\\\\mu)} Noting that, for one observation the score is :\\\\frac{\\\\partial Q}{\\\\partial \\\\mu} = \\\\frac{y-\\\\mu}{\\\\sigma^2V(\\\\mu)} The first two Bartlett equations are satisfied for the quasi-score, namely : E[U] = 0 and : \\\\operatorname{Cov}(U) + E\\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\partial U}{\\\\partial \\\\mu}\\\\right] = 0. In addition, the quasi-score is linear in y. Ultimately the goal is to find information about the parameters of interest \\\\beta. Both the QS and the QL are actually functions of \\\\beta. Recall, \\\\mu = g^{-1}(\\\\eta), and \\\\eta = X\\\\beta, therefore, :\\\\mu = g^{-1}(X\\\\beta). Quasi-information (QI) The quasi- information, is similar to the Fisher information, :i_b = -\\\\operatorname{E}\\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\partial U}{\\\\partial \\\\beta}\\\\right] QL,QS,QI as functions of \\\\beta The QL, QS and QI all provide the building blocks for inference about the parameters of interest and therefore it is important to express the QL, QS and QI all as functions of \\\\beta. Recalling again that \\\\mu = g^{-1}(X\\\\beta), we derive the expressions for QL,QS and QI parametrized under \\\\beta. Quasi-likelihood in \\\\beta, : Q(\\\\beta,y) = \\\\int_y^{\\\\mu(\\\\beta)} \\\\frac{y-t}{\\\\sigma^2V(t)} \\\\, dt The QS as a function of \\\\beta is therefore :U_j(\\\\beta_j) = \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial \\\\beta_j} Q(\\\\beta,y) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mu_i}{\\\\partial\\\\beta_j} \\\\frac{y_i-\\\\mu_i(\\\\beta_j)}{\\\\sigma^2V(\\\\mu_i)} :U(\\\\beta) = \\\\begin{bmatrix} U_1(\\\\beta)\\\\\\\\\\\\ U_2(\\\\beta)\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots\\\\\\\\\\\\ U_p(\\\\beta) \\\\end{bmatrix} = D^TV^{-1}\\\\frac{(y-\\\\mu)}{\\\\sigma^2} Where, :\\\\underbrace{D}_{n \\\\times p} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mu_1}{\\\\partial \\\\beta_1} &\\\\cdots&\\\\cdots&\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mu_1}{\\\\partial \\\\beta_p} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mu_2}{\\\\partial \\\\beta_1} &\\\\cdots&\\\\cdots&\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mu_2}{\\\\partial \\\\beta_p} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mu_m}{\\\\partial \\\\beta_1} &\\\\cdots&\\\\cdots&\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mu_m}{\\\\partial \\\\beta_p} \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\underbrace{V}_{n\\\\times n} = \\\\operatorname{diag}(V(\\\\mu_1),V(\\\\mu_2),\\\\ldots,\\\\ldots,V(\\\\mu_n)) The quasi- information matrix in \\\\beta is, :i_b = -\\\\frac{\\\\partial U}{\\\\partial \\\\beta} = \\\\operatorname{Cov}(U(\\\\beta)) = \\\\frac{D^TV^{-1}D}{\\\\sigma^2} Obtaining the score function and the information of \\\\beta allows for parameter estimation and inference in a similar manner as described in Application – weighted least squares. === Non-parametric regression analysis === A scattor plot of years in the major league against salary (x$1000). The line is the trend in the mean. The plot demonstrates that the variance is not constant. The smoothed conditional variance against the smoothed conditional mean. The quadratic shape is indicative of the Gamma Distribution. The variance function of a Gamma is V(\\\\mu) = \\\\mu^2 Non-parametric estimation of the variance function and its importance, has been discussed widely in the literature In non-parametric regression analysis, the goal is to express the expected value of your response variable(y) as a function of your predictors (X). That is we are looking to estimate a mean function, g(x) = \\\\operatorname{E}[y\\\\mid X=x] without assuming a parametric form. There are many forms of non-parametric smoothing methods to help estimate the function g(x). An interesting approach is to also look at a non-parametric variance function, g_v(x) = \\\\operatorname{Var}(Y\\\\mid X=x). A non-parametric variance function allows one to look at the mean function as it relates to the variance function and notice patterns in the data. :g_v(x) = \\\\operatorname{Var}(Y\\\\mid X=x) =\\\\operatorname{E}[y^2\\\\mid X=x] - \\\\left[\\\\operatorname{E}[y\\\\mid X=x]\\\\right]^2 An example is detailed in the pictures to the right. The goal of the project was to determine (among other things) whether or not the predictor, number of years in the major leagues (baseball,) had an effect on the response, salary, a player made. An initial scatter plot of the data indicates that there is heteroscedasticity in the data as the variance is not constant at each level of the predictor. Because we can visually detect the non-constant variance, it useful now to plot g_v(x) = \\\\operatorname{Var}(Y\\\\mid X=x) =\\\\operatorname{E}[y^2\\\\mid X=x] - \\\\left[\\\\operatorname{E}[y\\\\mid X=x]\\\\right]^2 , and look to see if the shape is indicative of any known distribution. One can estimate \\\\operatorname{E}[y^2\\\\mid X=x] and \\\\left[\\\\operatorname{E}[y\\\\mid X=x]\\\\right]^2 using a general smoothing method. The plot of the non- parametric smoothed variance function can give the researcher an idea of the relationship between the variance and the mean. The picture to the right indicates a quadratic relationship between the mean and the variance. As we saw above, the Gamma variance function is quadratic in the mean. == Notes References== * * ==External links== * Category:Functional analysis Category:Nonparametric statistics Category:Nonparametric regression Category:Actuarial science Category:Generalized linear models ","title":"Variance function"},{"id":"42061250","text":"Paavolainen is a Finnish language patronymic surname derived from the first name Paavo.http://verkkopalvelu.vrk.fi/Nimipalvelu/default.asp?L=1 nimipalvelu Notable people with the surname include: *Pekka Paavolainen (1868–1930), Finnish lawyer, civil servant and politician *Erkki Paavolainen (1890–1930), Finnish journalist, educationist and politician *Jaakko Paavolainen (1927–2007), Finnish historian ==References== Category:Finnish-language surnames Category:Patronymic surnames ","title":"Paavolainen"},{"id":"42061265","text":"Birdsong is an English surname.

He is best known for his participation in the Malaspina Expedition. == Biography == He was born in Cassano d'Adda. He decided to become an artist at an early age and worked as a painter in Milan, where he studied with Giocondo Albertolli at the Brera Academy.\\"Ferdinando Brambilla from Cassano, a painter in Antarctica\\" @ Io Prima di Me. His early style was heavily influenced by the French painter Claude Joseph Vernet. In 1790, he was working as a set designer and scenery painter at La Scala when Francesco Melzi d'Eril and Count , on behalf of the Spanish government, proposed that he be added to the Malaspina Expedition as one of the official artists.Biographical notes @ the Alexandro Malaspina Research Center. He was hired, together with Giovanni Ravenet, a painter from Parma, to replace artists who had resigned.\\"Fernando Brambila, Court painter to Charles IV\\" by Emilio Soler Pascual @ Biblioteca Virtual Miguel de Cervantes. In April 1791, he began his journey to join the expedition. After making his way to La Coruña, he boarded the frigate El Cortés, headed for America. He met with the expedition at Acapulco, where he executed his first paintings. The naturalist Antonio Pineda later claimed that Brambila also travelled about to paint Aztec antiquities, but these works have not been found. He was stationed aboard the corvette Atrevida. His paintings included numerous panoramic views with the precise details of defensive systems, monuments etc.; from Guam, the Mariana Islands, Palapa, Sorsogon City and Zamboanga in the Philippines, Macao, Port Jackson and Parramatta in Australia, Vava'u, Lima, Buenos Aires and Montevideo. He and Ravenet returned together in 1795 and remained in Spain, working for the government at a rate of 27,000 reales per year, as stipulated in their contract. He created lithographs and engravings based on his paintings for a book on the expedition. In 1799, on the occasion of Cardinal Luis María de Borbón's elevation to Archbishop of Toledo, he designed and created a triumphal arch for the Cathedral. That same year, King Carlos IV named him \\"Painter, Architect and Decorator for the Royal Court\\". He was married the following year, but had only one son before becoming a widower. ==After the expedition== In May 1806, his contract expired. He and Ravenet presented all of their works to Count , Director of the Hydrographic Office. Two years later, following the Siege of Zaragoza, he and his fellow artist Juan Gálvez went there by invitation of General José de Palafox to create a graphic record of the event's aftermath. Thirty-two of these drawings were later published as Grabados de la Ruina de Zaragoza. He briefly returned to Madrid, then fled to Cádiz when it became obvious that Napoleon's troops would take the city. Following the end of the Peninsular War, he went back to Madrid, where he took up his position as Court Painter under the new King, Fernando VII. In 1814, he was appointed the Director of Perspective and Decorative Art at the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando and became an Academician of Merit the following year. In 1817, the Academy published his Tratado de Principios Elementales de Perspectiva. Four years later, he was commissioned to create a series of paintings and lithographs depicting Royal sites; including El Escorial, Aranjuez, Buen Retiro and Moncloa Palace; a project that kept him engaged until 1832. They were published as Vistas de los Sitios Reales y Madrid. He had suffered from a serious illness in 1829 and never fully recovered. After seeking cures at various spas, he died at his home in Madrid in 1834. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Carmen Sotos Serrano, Los Pintores de la Expedición de Alejandro Malaspina, Real Academia de la Historia, 1982 * José Luis Sancho, Aranjuez: Solan de Cabras- La Isabela (Las Visitas de los Sitios Reales por Brambilla), Doce Calles, 2002, == External links == *\\"The Siege of Zaragoza\\", exhibition at the *More works by Brambila @ the Biblioteca Digital Hispánica.

HJ Bunko has published seventeen volumes since 2009 under their HJ Bunko imprint, as well as two side story volumes. A manga adaptation with art by Tomosane Ariike is serialized in Hobby Japan's online seinen manga magazine Comic Dangan. A 12-episode anime television series adaptation by Silver Link aired between July 11 and September 26, 2014. ==Plot== Kōtarō Satomi decided to live on his own when he began high school, and chose Room 106 of Corona House because it was cheap. Unfortunately, Kōtarō soon discovers that numerous otherworldly and supernatural girls also want his room for various reasons of their own, and aren't about to back down. As a result, Kōtarō and the girls find themselves forced to live together as they try to settle just who ends up with the room. ==CharactersMain characters=== ; : :A high school boy who moves to room 106 and intends to keep it at all costs due to its unexpectedly cheap 5,000 yen per month rent. After an accident in the archaeology site he works at, he gains the ability to see ghosts and wield ancient artifacts. He usually is seen wearing the replica of the Blue Knight’s armor Theia has when fighting, along with using his two swords, Saguratin and later (after Volume 7) Signaltin. While at first not that experienced in sword fighting, he gains a much higher level of skill after he returned from Ancient Forthorthe in the past with Clan (Clariossa Daora Forthorthe) due to all the fighting he did there (explained in Volume 7.5 and 8.5) ; : :A female ghost who haunts room 106. She wants to expel Kōtarō and claim the room as her own. She is able to manipulate solid items and launch them to attack, but her attack is neutralized when near sacred objects. Later, it is revealed that she is actually a soul who has left her body, and the room 106 residents work together to restore her. She eventually gains her real body back, but still a has high levels of spiritual energy as well as having the ability of Astral Projection, that is, to leave her body and project her ghost form at her leisure. ; : :A clumsy magical girl who intends to occupy the room, which contains high levels of magical power, with the intention of defending it from other magical girls who may use such power for evil. She constantly summons magical force fields whenever room 106 residents start engaging each other. Despite this, the residents of room 106 refuse to believe that she is a magical girl, instead considering her a mere otaku who loves cosplay. ; : :A well-endowed descendant of the Earth People, who moved underground during centuries past, and a member of the Kurano clan, a family of oracles and spellmasters, who claims that she needs to rebuild a shrine on the room's location and use the etheric energy gathered by it to generate weapons and launch an invasion against the people on the surface. It is later revealed that the Kurano clan wants to make peace, and she is actually doing her best to delay the invasion. She eventually succeeded as the Kurano clan restored its political power before the invasion can actually take place. ; : :While her full name is Theiamillis Gre Mastir Sagurada von Forthorthe, her name is often shortened to Theia, or called Tulip. An intergalactic alien princess from a planet named Fortorthe and armed with pulse lasers and cannons. Theia is given the task of capturing a spot in intergalactic space in order to prove her worthiness as a successor to the throne. For the first time ever the random spot chosen by the computer was on an inhabited planet, namely room 106. This means she also has to get the allegiance of the inhabitants, i.e Kōtarō. She is fond of a Fortorthe legend known as the Blue Knight, and named her spaceship and battle armor after him. She later granted the armor to Kōtarō, along with her personal sword, Saguratin. ; : :Theia's servant. Ruth often gives useful advice to her master. After an incident where Kōtarō, in his sleep, mistook her for a rhinoceros beetle, she flies into a rage whenever she sees one. She wishes nothing more than for the happiness of her childhood friend and master Theia, and is often seen supporting her in any way possible. ; : :Coming from a wealthy family, she is the kind and well-mannered president of the school knitting club and the only other member besides Kōtarō. Her closeness with him is a constant source of jealousy for the girls living with him, She has feelings for Kotaro. ; : :Landlady of the Corona House (home of Room 106), qi-using master martial artist, and a high school girl. Shizuka is the current host of the Fire Dragon Emperor Alunaya. When his power leaks out, it strengthens Shizuka's already strong body. This is the reason why she was able to overpower all of the invaders the day they met despite their own powers. Even without using Alunaya powers, Shizuka's martial arts skills puts her in the same league as the invader girls. She accepts the need of the room 106 residents to compete over it, but forces them to keep the competition peaceful and normal. Shizuka is friendly, respectful, and easy to get along with. She is strongly protective of her family's apartment since both of her parents are dead. Along with taking great care of it, she will become enraged whenever it is damaged. The ' is a band of knights created by Koutarou Satomi serving under princess Theiamillis Gre Forthorthe. Satomi Knights member uniforms were designed somewhat resembling of Koutarou's armor, but the design in its entirety is closer to a school uniform. The colors were blue and white, based on the Blue Knight and Alaia, and then each person's personal color was added in. ; : :Often called Clan, Clariossa Daora Forthorthe is the Second Princess of the Forthorthe Royal family. As such, she is a constant rival and enemy to Theia, even more so given the fact that their families, the Mastir (Theia) and Schweiger (Clan) never got along well in the first place. Originally appearing as an enemy intending to get rid of Theia so as to make her fail her task, but after the events that took place in the past in Forthorthe with Koutarou (after Volume 7, with the story being explained in Volume 7.5 and 8.5), she becomes quite close with Koutarou and decides to rather make Koutarou her vassal, and starts to care less about the throne. From then on, rather than resorting to underhanded tactics, she decides to fight Theia fair and square for the rights to Throne, while in reality caring much more about simply having and making Koutarou her vassal. :She is not only very intelligent, but also a very smart scientist, having created most of the equipment and weapons she uses herself. ; : :A magical girl part of the organisation called Darkness Rainbow, she is an enemy of Yurika, as the two organisations Darkness Rainbow and Rainbow Heart are enemies of each other. Appearing as an enemy, and being the main villain of Volume 5, she later on becomes very friendly with Koutarou after he saved her life (Volume 8). From then on, she sees Koutarou not as an enemy, but as a close friend who she does not wish to harm. While still part of Darkness Rainbow, eventually she decides to leave them and live on simply as Aika Maki, and not a member of Darkness Rainbow (Volume 12). ===Supporting characters=== ; : :One of Kiriha's battle drones. ; : :Another of Kiriha's battle drones. ; : :Kōtarō's friend and classmate who works at the same archaeology site as him. ==MediaLight novels=== The first light novel volume was published on March 1, 2009 by Hobby Japan under their HJ Bunko imprint.

It is owned by Emperor International Holdings Limited. ==HistoryFormer use=== The site was formerly home to the Lido Complex. Developed by Lido Development (a subsidiary of the Fung Ping Fan company) and opened on 1 February 1976, the complex was marketed as a \\"year-round resort\\" and housed restaurants and recreational facilities. The complex was expanded in 1983. The complex was put up for sale when Fung Ping Fan ran into financial difficulties. It was sold (excluding the McDonald's restaurant) to Hairich Limited, a subsidiary of Intercontinential Housing Development (IHD) Limited, in 1987. In 1993, IHD announced it would sell the complex to Gold Shine Investment, a company 55 per cent owned by Emperor International Holdings, 25 per cent by IHE itself, 15 per cent by Supreity and five per cent by Sonny Yeung Hoi-sing. ===Illegal redevelopment=== In 1998, Emperor International got Town Planning Board approval to develop a three-storey shopping centre on the site. The company bought the Lido Complex's McDonald's shop in mid-2000 for HK$36.8 million, allowing the redevelopment to move ahead. The firm stated that year that it would spend about HK$500 million on the development. Emperor International built a , six-storey shopping arcade called \\"The Pulse\\" on the site, which was substantially complete by 2011. However, it did so without the consent of the Lands Department, in breach of the land lease conditions. This led to a protracted legal battle between the developer and the government. The shopping centre remained empty, leading to public complaints over the lack of shopping and dining options along the beach. In May 2012, the issue was settled, with Emperor International Group Limited paying a HK$798 million land premium to the Hong Kong government. The shopping centre subsequently opened in November 2014. ==References * Category:2014 establishments in Hong Kong Category:Shopping centres in Hong Kong Category:Repulse Bay ","title":"The Pulse (shopping mall)"},{"id":"42061615","text":"The surname Constantinidis, Constantinides, Konstantinidis, Konstantinides () is a patronymic surname which literally means \\"the son of Konstantinos (Constantinos, Kostas, Costas)\\".

He became the principal of the Armenian school in Shushi for two years. After his marriage, Khajag settled in Tiflis in 1903 and became one of the editors of the Armenian newspaper Mshak. While working for the newspaper, he also taught on the side at the Nersisyan School. In 1906, he became one of the founding editors of the newspaper Harach, working alongside Avetis Aharonian and Yeghisheh Topjian. In 1908 he was arrested and sent to prison, where he remained for six months. After being released, Khajag was arrested again and sent to prison nine months later. After being released from prison in 1912, Khajag returned to Constantinople where he contributed to the local newspaper Azadamard, while becoming a principal of an Armenian school in the district of Samatya. ==Death== Karekin Khajag was one of the Armenian leaders deported during the Armenian Genocide. On the night of 24 April 1915, Khajag was arrested and imprisoned in Constantinople, then sent via train to Ayaş, a village located in the interior provinces of the Ottoman Empire. Confined in a prison at Ayaş, Khajag along with Rupen Zartarian, Sarkis Minassian, Khachatur Malumian, Harutiun Jangülian, and Nazaret Daghavarian were to be transferred to Diyarbakir on 2 June. Ostensibly, they were to undergo a court-martial in Diyarbakir; however, Khajag along with the rest were murdered en route in the area of Karacur between Urfa and Severek (today Siverek). The order for the murder was given from Captain Şevket to Haci Onbaşı, a member of the Special Organization. ==ReferencesBibliography== * * * Category:1867 births Category:1915 deaths Category:Armenian nationalists Category:People who died in the Armenian Genocide Category:Armenian journalists Category:Armenian educators Category:Armenian Revolutionary Federation politicians Category:People from Gyumri Category:University of Geneva alumni Category:Armenian male writers ","title":"Karekin Khajag"},{"id":"42061660","text":"Gualtiero Tumiati ( 8 May 1876 – 23 April 1971) was an Italian actor and stage director. == Life and career == Born in Ferrara, Tumiati studied at the College of the Oaks in Florence and there he attended the acting courses held by Luigi Rasi. He later graduated in law and while working as an apprentice lawyer at his father's law firm he started performing in some local stage companies. Tumiati's breakout role was Cyrano de Bergerac in a critically acclaimed representation of the Edmond Rostand's eponymous play held in 1910. With his wife, the actress and painter Beryl Hight, in 1928 Tumiati founded the \\"Sala Azzurra\\" (\\"Blue Room\\"), one of the first Avant-garde theaters in Italy. He taught acting at the Accademia d'Arte Drammatica in Rome and at the Accademia dei filodrammatici in Milan.

The Division 1 premiership was won for the second consecutive year by the Preston Football Club, after it defeated Dandenong in the Grand Final on 21 September by 12 points; it was Preston's second Division 1 premiership. The Division 2 premiership was won by Williamstown, in its second season since being relegated from Division 1. ==Clearance disputes== There had been open conflict on clearances between the Association and the Victorian Football League since the Association introduced transfer fees on its players in April 1967. League clubs were forbidden from paying transfer fees by the League's player payment rules (the \\"Coulter Laws\\"), and so the League terminated the 1949 clearance reciprocity agreement with the Association, allowing Association players to transfer directly to the League without a clearance, and vice versa, and it also had a ban on approving clearances to the Association in place during much of the dispute. Despite the opportunity to transfer without a clearance, only three players had made this move to the League between 1967 and 1969: Terry Alexander, and future Hall of Fame players Kevin Sheedy and Peter Bedford – in no case was the transfer fee paid. All were suspended from the Association for five years, and the severity of this suspension is thought to have deterred others – particularly those who were not guaranteed to win a regular senior place in the League – from risking the move. The only player whose transfer fee was officially paid was 1967 Liston Trophy winner Jim Sullivan, who in 1968 attracted a $1,000 transfer fee to move to Claremont in the West Australian National Football League, a league which did not have the same payment restrictions as the VFL. On the other hand, more than sixty players from the VFL, mostly reserves and fringe senior players, made the cross to the Association without a clearance in the same time. In November 1968, the Australian National Football Council intervened in an attempt to end the clearance dispute, by mandating that the two competitions were required to recognise the other's clearances; the ANFC had long-standing rules requiring reciprocal recognition of clearances between interstate competitions, but a loophole meant that these rules had not applied to two competitions within the same state. In April 1969, the disagreement played out in the controversial case of Geoff Bryant. The Association approved the clearance of Bryant from Box Hill to the VFL's North Melbourne, and had set a transfer fee of $2,000 for Bryant's clearance. It was initially reported that the clearance had been approved without the transfer fee being paid, which could have occurred only if the Association had broken its own rules requiring the transfer fee. Association secretary Fred Hill responded to the press that this was not the case: that North Melbourne had indeed paid the transfer fee, and had done so secretly in defiance of the VFL's rules. Box Hill president Reg Shineberg described to the press the clandestine circumstances under which he had allegedly received the fee – in $10 and $20 notes, under cover of darkness outside VFA House, from a man he did not know. The VFL arbitrators investigated North Melbourne over the alleged breach of its payment rules, but the charges were dropped after the Association did not provide any written corroborating evidence to the investigation. Whether or not the illegal transfer fee was actually paid was never proven. On 11 April 1969, while the Bryant case was ongoing, the Association Board of Management agreed by a 41–2 majority to drop its transfer fee rule; but, it did not reinstate a clearance reciprocity agreement, and in Round 1, two League players were permitted to play in the Association without a clearance: John Ibrahim (from , fielded by Sunshine) and Alan White (from , fielded by Caulfield). The ANFC issued an ultimatum to the Association reinstate a clearance agreement with the League, but the Association refused, and yet more players crossed without a clearance (including Fred Cook, who went on to become the Association's all-time leading goalkicker); as a result, the Association was excluded from sending a team to the 1969 Interstate Carnival, which was held in Adelaide in June, and was then finally expelled altogether from the ANFC in March 1970 – ending its twenty-year affiliation with the national body which had started in August 1949. ==Division 1== The Division 1 home-and-home season was played over 18 rounds; the top four then contested the finals under the Page–McIntyre system. The finals were held at the Punt Road Oval, in Richmond. ===Ladder=== {  style=\\"text-align: center; font-size: 90%; width: 60%\\" - ! colspan=11 style=\\"background: #EBEBEB; font-size: 115%;\\"  1969 VFA Division 1 Ladder - style=\\"text-align: center; font-size: 90%;\\" ! !!

In 1947, Haiti voted in favour of the UN partition of Palestine that helped create the state of Israel. ==HistoryEarly history=== In 1947, Haiti voted in favor of the United Nations’ partition of Palestine that helped create the State of Israel. Prior to 1980, Haiti had an embassy in Jerusalem, the disputed capital city of Israel, but moved it to Tel Aviv following United Nations Security Council Resolution 478. ===Modern history=== Currently, Jewish-Haitian businessman, Gilbert Bigio is the honorary consul of Israel in Haiti, and has a large Israeli flag flying outside his home. \\"There has never been any anti- Semitism in this country... The Haitians always had admiration for Israel, and now more so than ever,\\" Bigio told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency. 2010 earthquake The Israel Defense Forces search and rescue team extracted a 52-year-old Haitian government employee, trapped in the ruins of the customs office in Port-au-Prince after 6 hours of work. In the wake of the devastating earthquake that destroyed much of Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince, killing more than 300,000 people and leaving nearly a million more homeless and without food, water or shelter, Israel was one of the first countries to send crews to assist in the devastated land. The Israel Defense Forces sent both search and rescue teams that sought remaining survivors, among crumbled buildings and homes as well sending medical teams to help care for the survivors. The medical team succeeded in setting up the first fully functioning field hospital, inclusive of an excess amount of advanced equipment. \\"During its time in Haiti, the delegation treated more than 1110 patients, conducted 319 successful surgeries, delivered 16 births including three by Cesarean sections and saved many from within the ruins.\\" On January 27, following the rescue team operations in Haiti, the Israeli government decided to continue its official assistance to Haiti coordinated through MASHAV, Israel's Agency for International Development Cooperation, and Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in part of a global effort to reconstruct the country.

CURS1-3 are responsible for the hydrolysis of feruloyldiketide-CoA, previously produced in the curcuminoid pathway, and a decarboxylative condensation reaction that together comprise one of the final steps in the synthesis pathway for curcumin, demethoxycurcumin, and bisdemethoxycurcumin, the compounds that give turmeric both its distinctive yellow color, and traditional medical benefits. CURS should not be confused with Curcuminoid Synthase (CUS), which catalyzes the one-pot synthesis of bisdemethoxycurcumin in Oryza sativa. == Structure == The Catalytic Triad of CURS1-Created in PyMol using PDB: 3OV2, doi:10.1074/jbc.M110.196279 Crystallization studies have determined that curcumin synthase is a homodimer of ketosynthase subunits. Each includes a highly conserved Cys (164), His (303), Asn (336) catalytic triad, and CURS1 has been shown to exhibit the αβαβα folding pattern, conserved features of type III PKSs. The catalytic triads are independent of each other and are contained in the center of each monomer, connected to the surface with a CoA binding tunnel. While CURS1, 2, and 3 share approximately 80% amino acid sequence identity, their small structural differences account for their differences in preferred starter substrates and most prolific product. ==Mechanism== Each CURS catalyzes the reactions necessary to convert a feruloyldiketide-CoA into a curcuminoid, but the three isoforms have preferred starter substrates and products. CURS1 converts feruloyldiketide-CoA esters into curcumin using feruloyl-CoA exclusively as a starter substrate. CURS2 produces both curcumin and demethoxycurcumin, favoring feruloyl-CoA as a starter, and CURS3 produces curcumin, demethoxycurcumin, and bisdemethoxycurcumin from either feruloyl-CoA or 4-coumaroyl-CoA as the starter substrate. The fact that preferences of starter substrates vary between the three CURS is corroborated by carbon labeling studies confirming the incorporation of a variety of starter substrates into curcuminoid products in C. longa. Only the mechanism of CURS1 has been elucidated. In the first step, the feruloyl moiety of feruloyl-CoA is transferred to Cys (164) followed by feruloyldiketide-CoA entering the CoA binding tunnel and being hydrolyzed through an unknown mechanism to a β-keto acid. The acid is then used as an extender substrate in the catalytic triad, where it undergoes decarboxylative condensation with the feruloyl moiety on Cys (164). This mechanism is thought to be identical to that of the decarboxylative condensation of malonyl-CoA in other type III PKSs. The hydrolysis of the diketide has been shown to be the rate-limiting step of the enzyme. The Proposed Mechanism of CURS1-Original work using ChemBioDraw. Based upon the mechanism elucidated in doi:10.1074/jbc.M110.196279 It was previously hypothesized that the curcumoid pathway employed two cinnamoyl-CoAs and one malonyl-CoA, but this was suggested against by the absence of a necessary intermediate such a pathway (bisdeshydroxybisdesmethoxycurcumin), strengthening evidence for feruloyl-CoA or 4-coumaroyl-CoA as starter substrate in CURS. ==Biological activity== The production of curcumin and its derivatives by CURS may be a defense mechanism of C. longa against internal and external threats. Curcumin is a potent antioxidant, as its phenolic structure, highest in activity in curcumin rather than its demethoxylated derivatives, acts as a free-radical scavenging apparatus, eliminating free superoxides and DPPH from the plant's cells. Curcumin synthase may also protect Curcuma longa from herbivores to some degree, as curcumin has a distinctively bitter taste: studies show CURS1, 2 have higher expression in the leaves of C. longa than the rhizome while CURS3 shows equal expression in both locations. ==Role in cancer research== Research suggests that curcumin is an active anti-cancer molecule against cancers of brain, breast, bones, blood, gastrointestinal tract, genitourinary tract, as well as thoracic and gynecological cancers. The molecule achieves this wide- range activity by up or down-regulating numerous receptors, kinases, growth factors, transcriptional factors, and inflammatory cytokines, among others, thus its biosynthesis is of great interest to medicine. For instance, curcumin inhibits mammalian nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) by preventing its translocation to the nucleus. This inhibitory action upregulates the levels of preapoptotic and apoptotic cells, eliminating damaged cells, and discouraging abnormal growth patterns, as well as decreasing chemokine levels. As activated NF-κB is associated with oxidative stress, inhibition of the nuclear factor by curcumin is consistent with the chemical's role as an antioxidant. A homologous system to NF-κB signaling exists in plants, evidence that curcumin may play a similar role in C. longa as it does in humans. Curcumin syntheses in C. longa have been until recently, the only readily available synthesis method of curcumin. Today, laboratory syntheses are capable of producing the chemical, and numerous teams are constructing curcumin analogues designed to target specific biological processes, such as the NFκB signaling pathway previously discussed. == References == Category:EC 2.3.1 ","title":"Curcumin synthase"},{"id":"42062078","text":"Xinwei is a town under the jurisdiction of Xingning City, Meizhou, in eastern Guangdong Province, China. == References == Category:Xingning, Guangdong Category:Township-level divisions of Guangdong ","title":"Xinwei, Meizhou"},{"id":"42062095","text":"Yetang is a town under the jurisdiction of Xingning City, Meizhou, in eastern Guangdong Province, China. == References == Category:Xingning, Guangdong Category:Township-level divisions of Guangdong ","title":"Yetang, Meizhou"},{"id":"42062102","text":"Mona is an unincorporated community and census-designated place in Mitchell County, Iowa, United States.

Between 2001 and 2010 he led with Ruben Pozo the Spanish rock band Pereza, with which he recorded 6 albums. After the dissolution of the band, he started a solo career with 3 charting solo albums: Diciembre in 2012, Pólvora in 2014 and Monstruos in 2016. ==Biography== Leiva was born and raised in the neighborhood of Alameda de Osuna, in the northeast suburbs of Madrid. His great love of football coupled with his strong resemblance to Leivinha, a Brazilian footballer who at the time played for Atlético de Madrid, earned him the nickname Leiva. He would later use it as his stage name. ===In Pereza=== His first musical activity was in 1994, as he became part of the Malahierba band in which he was a drummer. In 1998 he formed a trio band together with Rubén Pozo and drummer Tuli with the intention of making cover versions of Leño. Subsequently Malahierba would evolve and become the band Pereza. The band released its debut album in 2001, but without much success. From the second album, Algo para cantar in 2003, the formation became a duo of Leiva and Ruben. With Animales in 2005, they gained great fame and consolidated their position as one of the most important Spanish pop rock bands. Pereza had three more albums, Los amigos de los animales in 2006, Aproximaciones in 2007 and Aviones in 2009. ===Solo career=== The duo split in September 2011 with Leiva continuing as a solo singer, songwriter and musician. The first solo album of Leiva was Diciembre (2012), that was self-produced and received positive reviews and awards such as the Rolling Stone Award for best album of the year and two Latin Grammy nominations. In January 2014 Leiva came out with his second solo album, titled Pólvora, a co-production with the Spanish musician Carlos Raya and Joe Blaney as soundman. Both albums have proven very successful with Leiva releasing three singles charting singles on the Spanish singles market, and charting in PROMUSICAE charts, namely \\"Eme\\", \\"Afuera en la ciudad\\" and \\"Terriblemente Cruel\\" the latter two making it to positions 6 and 5 respectively on the Spanish charts. 'Eme' is a song which was dedicated to Michelle Jenner after a tough breakup. The singer express the left of her girlfriend, his feelings and his thoughts, hoping that she would come back. In 2016 Leiva came out with \\"Monstruos\\". Is a record in which he explains the monsters the common social fears at bedtime. ==DiscographyAlbums and DVDs with Pereza=== *2001: Pereza (the only album as a trio, Rubén, Leiva and Tuli). *2002: Algo para cantar (as a duo of Rubén and Leiva) *2003: Algo para encantar (DVD) *2004: Algo para cantar (Special edition). *2005: Animales (\\"Princesas\\" became a successful single from the album) *2005: Princesas (DVD) *2006: Los amigos de los animales (Album and DVD) *2006: Barcelona (Album and DVD) *2007: Aproximaciones *2009: Baires, libro (Album and DVD) *2009: Aviones (Album and DVD) (notably romantic songs like \\"Llévame al baile\\" *2010: 10 años ===Solo albums=== {  !align=\\"center\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" width=\\"10\\"Year !align=\\"center\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" width=\\"120\\"Album !align=\\"center\\" colspan=\\"1\\" width=\\"20\\"Peak positions !align=\\"center\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" width=\\"70\\"Certification - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\\"  SPA -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"2012 Diciembre  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"3  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"2014 Pólvora  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"1  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" -  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"2016 Monstruos  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"1  style=\\"text- align:center;\\" -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"2019 Nuclear  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"1  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - } === Solo singles === * \\"Eme\\" (2012) * \\"Terriblemente Cruel\\" (2013) * \\"Afuera En La Ciudad\\" (2014) * \\"Mirada Perdida\\" (2014) * \\"Sixteen\\" (featuring Carlos Tarque and Fito Cabrales) (2015) * \\"Sincericidio\\" (2016) * \\"La Lluvia en los Zapatos\\" (2016) * \\"Breaking Bad\\" (2017) * \\"La Llamada\\" (2017) * \\"No Te Preocupes por Mi\\" (2018) * \\"Nuclear\\" (2019) * \\"Lobos\\" (2019) * \\"En El Espacio\\" (2019) * \\"Mi Pequeño Chernóbil\\" (2020) * \\"La Estación Eterna\\" (2020) ==References== Category:Spanish male singers Category:Spanish songwriters Category:1980 births Category:Living people Category:Singers from Madrid Category:Spanish pop singers Category:Spanish rock singers Category:21st-century Spanish singers Category:21st-century male singers Category:Sony Music Spain artists ","title":"Leiva (singer)"},{"id":"42062149","text":"The 2014 Men's South American Volleyball Club Championship was the sixth official edition of the men's volleyball tournament, played by eight teams over 19–23 February 2014 in Belo Horizonte, Brazil.

She was the presiding judge in the 2014 trial of Oscar Pistorius for the killing of Reeva Steenkamp. Her verdict of not guilty of murder was later overturned on appeal. ==Early life and education== Masipa was born and grew up in Orlando East, Soweto, Johannesburg, the eldest of 10 children. After matriculating from Immaculata High School in the Alexandra township in 1966, she obtained a BA degree specialising in Social Work in 1974 and a LLB in 1990 from the University of South Africa. She was admitted as an advocate in 1991. ==Career== Prior to her law career, Masipa worked as a social worker and as a crime reporter, which led to her interest in law. She worked for The World, Post and The Sowetan newspapers and edited the Queen women's supplement of Pace magazine. In 1998, she was appointed as a judge in the Transvaal Provincial Division (as it was then known) of the High Court of South Africa, becoming the second black woman to be appointed as a judge in the High Court after Lucy Mailula, who was appointed to the Transvaal Provincial Division of the Supreme Court (as it was then known) in 1995. Masipa has also served in Gauteng's consumer court tribunal, the Estate Agents Board, and the Electoral Court of South Africa. In a 2003 interview with the Judicial Service Commission, Masipa supported greater transparency and interaction with the media to aid the public's understanding of the judicial process. She is one of the seven female South African judges featured in Courting Justice, a 2008 documentary film directed by Jane Lipman. ==Notable judgements== Masipa contributed to case law on the constitutional duties of local government related to housing in her 2009 ruling on Blue Moonlight Properties v Occupiers of Saratoga Avenue. ===State v Oscar Pistorius=== Masipa was the presiding judge in the trial of Oscar Pistorius for the murder of Reeva Steenkamp and several gun-related charges which commenced in the High Court in Pretoria on 3 March 2014. She appointed two assessors to assist her in the trial. According to the spokesperson for the South African judiciary, she was not specially assigned to the case because of her gender. Following her assignment to the high-profile case, her colleagues reportedly described her as respected, competent, eloquent, and reserved. According to media monitoring company ROi Africa, the majority of social media comments during the delivery of the verdict were critical of Judge Masipa after it became evident that Pistorius would not be found guilty of murder, a decision which was later overturned by the Appeal Court and a murder verdict recorded. Judge Masipa, who was given police protection from the beginning of the trial, was subjected to threats and personal attacks by people who disagreed with the verdict. In her new sentence for Pistorius based on a murder conviction, Masipa only increased his sentence by 1 year to 6 years. The 6 year sentence for murder was appealed by the National Prosecuting Authority and they convinced South Africa's Supreme Court of Appeal to increase the sentence.

It was an independent township until 1975, but since then it is part of Rascafría, being considered as one of the nucleus of the population. Views of Peñalara from Oteruelo del Valle ==Historical developmentFrom origins to the Middle Ages=== The origin of Oteruelo del Valle and Rascafría dates back in the Middle Ages, and it is related to the repopulation of the mountains of the valley. This territory that was part of Toledo was deserted, so that the councils could have it available freely, in exchange of several military services. Consequently, those territories were repopulated in a large number. Picture of the church La Iglesia de Nuestra Señora de la Paz, in Oteruelo ===16th, 17th and 18th centuries=== At that time, Rascafría and Oteruelo were unattached places, belonging to the Community of Segovia. There were 49 neighbours and 64 houses in Oteruelo, all of them established in the urban nucleus of the village. The main activity of people in there was the sheep stockbreeding and (despite it was less remarkable) the agriculture was also an important activity for them. There are little constructions that persist in time until nowadays, that´s why we should stand out the most singular building in Oteruelo, La Iglesia de Nuestra Señora de la Paz. It was damaged during the Civil War in 1936 and reconstructed in 1944 by the architect Rodolfo García-Pablos. ===19th and 20th centuries=== After the provincial restructuring made in 1833, either in Rascafría or Oteruelo, which were part of Segovia, turned to belong to the province of Madrid. The vegetative growth continued increasing and their principal source of income kept being the cattle industry and agriculture, with a minimum industrial activity. In 1975 the township of Oteruelo disappeared and annexed to Rascafría, which enhanced its population up to 1218 people. However, before Oteruelo joined Rascafría, the number of residents living there was just 208 people, who made a living working in different posts. Among the edifices build in that period, we should mention the schools, situated in the northern part of the village, next to the road. ===21st century=== At present, instead of the schools, there is the Sala Permanente Luis Feito, where there are shown many works of the author. ==Climate== It is surrounded by the Montes Carpetanos, Sierra de la Morcuera (east) and Cuerda Larga (south), and due to that it has many special climatic characteristics. Thanks to the \\"barrier effect\\" caused by Sierra de Guadarrama, which has points up to 2000 m, Oteruelo del Valle enjoys climatic parameters clearly different from other zones of the Castilian meseta. According to that information, the precipitation is very abundant and temperatures are less warm. That climate allows different species from the northwest part of Madrid live there, which are typical mostly in the peninsular centre. The river of Oteruelo del Valle ==Places of interest== In this locality the highlight could be the bell gable of the church. There is a clear mixture between new and old buildings, as the village shows. It also offers beautiful and pleasing roads which are very relaxing to walk through. In the entry of the village there is an ancient big chariot that is next to the \\"Medio Ambiente\\" building from the Community of Madrid. ==Luis Feito== One of the peculiarities of this village is the connection it has with the artist Luis Feito. There is a room at the entrance of this township which shows a big part of the recent graphic works made by this painter, who belongs to La Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando. He also founded the group El Paso junto a Millares, Sauca y Canogar, amongst others. Different works of etching from Peñalara can be taken into account in this man´s works, as well as many silk-screen paintings from Rascafría (2002) and Oteruelo (2002). Due to the familiar and affective correlation Feito has with the place and in general with the Valle of Lozoya, the artist donated many of his works to the neighbours of Oteruelo del Valle, with the aim of making his graphics works samples of the village in the near future. ==TravelBy road=== The village is situated in the highway M-604, to which you can gain access from: *Exit ramp 69 of the A-1 (Dual Carriageway of the North) . *Road M-611 from Miraflores de la Sierra. It leads into the road M-604, 2 km away from Oteruelo del Valle. *Road M-601/CL-601 in the pick of the pass of Navacerrada. ===By bus=== *194 communicates Oteruelo del Valle with Madrid and some other villages from the A-1. *194A communicates Oteruelo del Valle with Buitrago del Lozoya. Both lines link this locality with Rascafría and other townships crossed by the road M-604.

He represented the Victorian Metro region at the 2013 AFL Under 18 Championships, winning All-Australian selection for his performances. In 2013 he was also a member of the AIS-AFL Academy program. As part of the program he participated in a number of training sessions with the Richmond Football Club senior side in January 2013. Prior to the end of year AFL draft, media reports emerged suggesting he was a sought-after player by clubs including , and . Lennon was termed a \\"gun prospect\\" by AFL Media draft expert Callum Twomey in a feature article published on the AFL website in November 2013. ==AFL career== Lennon was drafted by with the club's first pick and the twelfth pick overall in the 2013 AFL National Draft. Following the draft Richmond recruiting manager Francis Jackson labelled him \\"an outstanding mark for his size\\" and \\"a constant threat overhead.\\" Jackson also lauded Lennon for his kicking skills and decision making prowess. Lennon's first season as a Richmond player was interrupted in February 2014, when a knee injury he sustained at training required surgery. Following his recovery he resumed his 2014 preparation by playing matches in the club's reserves side in the VFL. He made his league debut in round 9 of the 2014 season, in a match against at the MCG. Lennon started the match as the Richmond substitute and was not brought into the game until the third quarter.

He finished the match with an equal-team-high two goals. He would play the next four matches in the club's AFL side, before being dropped from the round 14 side to play . Lennon returned to the senior side in matches in rounds 21 and 22 before again being dropped from the round 23 side. He finished the season having played seven matches and having kicked two goals. Lennon sells the dummy during a Richmond VFL game in August 2017. Lennon struggled to gain AFL team selection in the early part of his second season. He played first in round 5 but struggled to make an impact, recording just three disposals in the match. He was dropped the following week and did not return to the club's AFL side until round 16, 2015. He impressed on that occasion however, recording an equal game-high three goals in the match. He played the next seven consecutive games, including a round 20 match against where he recorded 22 disposals. In round 22 Lennon Lennon gained a nomination for the 2015 AFL Rising Star award after a 26 disposal and nine mark performance in Richmond's win against . Despite his fine form, Lennon was dropped from the club's side to play in a first round elimination final. He finished the season having played nine matches and recording averages of 11.7 disposals and 4.9 marks per game. At the end of the season Lennon became the subject of media interest after efforts to strike a new contract with Richmond stalled. Reports suggest he was attracting interest from other clubs, most notably from . He was eventually re-signed by Richmond, in a two-year deal struck on 15 October. In the 2016 pre-season Lennon was struck by a bout of glandular fever. At the time he was recovering from minor hip surgery underwent at the conclusion of the previous season. As a result of the injury and illness he missed the club's pre-season training camp and faced a limited work load for much of the early part of the year. He played in the club's senior side in rounds 3 and 4 before being dropped from the side the following week. He struggled to gain senior selection in later weeks due to two concussions suffered in VFL matches. In May he suffered an AC joint injury during a club training session. The resulting surgery forced him to miss a further six weeks of matches at all levels. He was again injured in July, with an ankle injury suffered in a VFL match keeping him out a further three weeks. Lennon played just one more match that season, in round 21 against . In his three matches that season he recorded averages of 11.7 disposals and 6.3 marks per game. On the back of a third successive season of disappointment Lennon reportedly requested a trade in late August 2016. He later revealed coach Damien Hardwick has suggested it would be beneficial to Lennon's career to seek options elsewhere. Despite this Lennon would stay put, with interest from other club's reportedly minimal. Lennon hired a private sprint coach ahead of the 2017 season, hoping to increase his fitness base and press for senior selection in 2017. Though he did not play round 1, the strategy appeared to have paid dividends when he was selected in round 2 to take on . He played just one more match before being dropped though, returning to reserves grade football in the VFL. There he was a significant contributor, scoring bags of goals on several occasions including a six-goal haul against North Ballarat in mid-April. Lennon looked likely to make a return in round 14 when he was named in the club's 25-man squad to take on Carlton. A hamstring injury sustained just hours before teams were to be named saw him miss out however, and ruled him out from playing for two weeks at all levels. When medium-sized forward Josh Caddy sustained a hamstring injury that ruled him out in round 22, Lennon was one of a number of forwards in the running to take up the role. He was not successful however, as eventual VFL league best and fairest winner Jacob Townsend claimed the spot and Lennon remained with the reserves. He ultimately not return to senior football in 2017 instead playing with the reserves team through to their finals campaign. There he played in each of the club's three finals three victories as well as in their losing grand final against Port Melbourne. He had an opportunity to win the game with a kick after the siren and from inside the centre square but managed to score only a behind. Lennon finished the 2017 season having played two matches and kicked one goal at senior level.

The 40-position chart is formulated based on each song's weekly radio spins, as measured by Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems. The earliest incarnation of the chart was first published on January 20, 1996 as a feature in Billboard sister publication Airplay Monitor. In 2006, Airplay Monitor ceased publication after Billboard parent company VNU Media's acquisition of rival radio trade magazine Radio & Records, which then subsequently incorporated Airplay Monitors Nielsen-based Triple A chart. Billboard itself began publishing the Triple A chart in the issue dated July 5, 2008 through their Billboard.biz website, appropriating the same airplay data as Radio & Records. Radio & Records closed in June 2009, leaving Billboard as the sole publisher of the chart. In February 2014, the chart's reporting panel was expanded from 23 to 32 stations, including non-commercial reporters for the first time. The current number-one single, as of the chart for the week ending September 19, 2020, is \\"Feel You\\" by My Morning Jacket. Following a re-design of their website, Billboard officially incorporated the history of the Airplay Monitor/Nielsen chart from 1996 to 2008 into their Adult Alternative Songs chart.

It was designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1956 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011. The house was certainly one of the first frame buildings constructed in Grand Traverse County, and is thought to be the first post and beam house constructed in Michigan's lower peninsula north of Grand Rapids. ==History== In 1839, the Presbyterian Board of Missions sent Reverend Peter Dougherty to the Grand Traverse area. He originally chose a site at what is now Elk Rapids, Michigan, and constructed a log church there. However, in May 1839, Chief Ahgosa of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, asked Dougherty to move to what is now Old Mission, Michigan. There, Dougherty established a small settlement, moving the mission church from the Elk Rapids site and adding a school and cabins. In 1840, Dougherty married Maria Higgins of Princeton, New Jersey, and the couple returned to Michigan to live at the Old Mission site. Peter and Maria Dougherty eventually had nine children born in Michigan In 1842, Dougherty realized he needed a more permanent residence for his family, and constructed the house that is currently on this site. The house was certainly one of the first frame buildings constructed in Grand Traverse County, and is thought to be the first post and beam house constructed in Michigan's lower peninsula north of Grand Rapids. By 1850, the village around the mission included 40 log homes, in addition to the church and school. However, in that same year, the treaty with the Native Americans was renegotiated, resulting in the local populace purchasing land across the bay near what is now Omena, Michigan. In 1852, Dougherty moved his mission across the bay to Omena, establishing a \\"New Mission\\" at the site. The house at the old mission remained standing, unused, until 1861, when Dougherty sold it to Solon Rushmore. Rushmore farmed the surrounding land until his death in 1870. His cousin Duranty Rushmore then purchased the property. Duranty Rushmore continued farming, but soon realized that he could capitalize on the new tourist market opening in the area. He turned Dougherty's mission house into an inn, called the \\"Rushmore House.\\" The Rushmores at some point in the late 19th century added the rear kitchen addition to the house, and added the front wraparound porch near the turn of the century. Duranty Rushmore died in 1894, passing the property along to his son William, who with his wife Minnie continued to farm and run the inn. However, on William's death in 1916, the property passed to his son Maurice who lived in New Jersey, and although Minnie Rushmore continued to summer there, it was apparently no longer used as an inn. The house stayed in the hands of the Rushmore family for nearly 100 years. At some point, a replica of the original 1839 mission church was built nearby, and in 1956, the home and mission were placed on the Michigan Historic Sites Register. In 1961, Maurice Rushmore sold the Dougherty house to Virginia Larson, who lived nearby at the time. Larson used the house for storage, but with the intention of eventually turning it into a museum. After her death in 2004, her heirs, David and Dan Larson, granted an option to purchase the home and its 15 surrounding acres to the Grand Traverse Regional Land Conservancy. In 2006, the house was purchased by Peninsula Township, and restoration work began. Nearby structures, such as the Rushmore-era ice house and outhouse, were restored, and the roof was replaced. As of 2014, it is administered by the Peter Dougherty Society. ==Description== The Dougherty Mission House is a two-story symmetrical frame structure on a fieldstone foundation with a side- gable roof and centered front gable. The sides are clad with clapboard siding and the roof with cedar shingles. There are attached porches on three sides of the house, and a kitchen addition at the rear that was likely added in the late 19th century. The front facade has a full-width porch with a center entrance. Four windows line the first floor around the entrance, placed nearly regularly, save for one offset window. The second floor has a center sash window located in the gable, flanked by two smaller eyebrow windows. One side of the house has six windows in the main section: three on the first floor, two on the second, and one in the attic. The other side lacks the attic window. There are additional windows in the rear and in the kitchen addition. The interior of the house contains 1160 square feet of space on each floor, plus an additional 370 square feet in the kitchen addition. The first floor contains eight rooms: a front entryway, parlor, and master bedroom, plus a second bedroom, two smaller rooms, a small bathroom, and the kitchen in the rear.

The Society did include the Apocrypha in Bibles for use in continental Europe, where it was normal for Protestant as well as Catholic readers to have the texts of the Apocrypha. Robert Haldane criticised this policy. The British and Foreign Bible Society had in fact dropped the Apocrypha from its bibles published in English in 1804. This decision broke with the tradition of Myles Coverdale, of consolidating the Apocrypha between the two Testaments. Haldane and William Thorpe began a general campaign in 1821, against all Bibles with the Apocrypha and their printing with funds raised from British sources. The Society was divided over the issue, but the majority view favoured the existing policy of case-by-case inclusion. In Spring 1826 an attempt to reach a compromise with the Haldane (\\"Recordite\\") view broke down. As a result, the major Scottish branches in Edinburgh and Glasgow left the Society. Most Scottish branches followed, and a few in England. ==NotesFurther reading== *A Biographical Dictionary of Eminent Scotsmen: Supplement Abercrombie-Wood, By Robert Chambers, Thomas Thomson, 1855, Blackie, pp. 276-78, a detailed and impassioned account from a strongly Protestant perspective.

This ban was lifted in 1987, largely due to the work of Akuffo. The film received its premiere at the Globe Cinema. The screening was designed to imitate a normal film screening: the video player was not visible to the audience, and Akuffo was in the projection room. == Legacy == Zinabu was the first Ghanaian video feature, beginning a new form of indigenous film production that would grow in the early 1990s.

Despite its lack of pigmentation, it is closely related to the most darkly-pigmented aspergilli in the Aspergillus niger group. It is a common soil fungus worldwide and is known as a contaminant of a wide array of materials from the indoor environment to foods and products. It is an uncommon agent of onychomycosis and aspergillosis. The species epithet candidus (L.) refers to the white pigmentation of colonies of this fungus. It is from the Candidi section. The fungi in the Candidi section are known for their white spores. It has been isolated from wheat flour, djambee, and wheat grain. ==History and taxonomy== Aspergillus candidus is a member of the genus Aspergillus in the family Trichocomaceae, phylum Ascomycota. A number of subspecies and varieties have been recognised including: A. candidus subsp. tjibodensis, A. candidus var. amylolyticus, A. candidus var. candidus, A. candidus var. densior, and A. candidus var. tenuissima. Synonyms of A. candidus include A. albus, A. okazakii, A. tritici, and A. triticus, and the fungus is closely related to A. niger and A. ochraceus. Early reports of white-spored aspergilli in the eighteenth and nineteenth century variously named these based on their gross appearance and white pigmentation, coining Latin species epithets such as 'candidus', 'albus', and 'niveus'. The species epithet 'candidus' was first used by Link in 1809, and later in 1824, he added two varieties, A. candidus var. tenuissima and A. candidus var. densior. In 1877, Wilhelm described a species with biseriate sterigmata, globose vesicles, and short conidiophores as A. albus, which shared similarities between the A. albus described by Haller in 1742 and A. candidus described by Link in 1809. One reason for the confusion of identifying different species of fungus was that, two different fungus looked very similar to each other, but one was uniseriate (meaning there is one row of cells on the spore-bearing surface) and the other was biseriate (meaning there are two rows of cells on the spore-bearing surface). Wehmer appeared to have been the first one to suggest that a single culture of Aspergillus can contain both uniseriate and biseriate sterigmata in 1901. Wehmer then suggested that the species A. albus, St. candida, and A. candidus were synonymous, but there wasn't enough information to prove any clear identities of these species. In 1926, Charles Thom, who was a scientist at the U.S. Department of Agriculture in Peoria, Illinois, and Church suggested to group A. candidus, A. Okazakii, St. szurakiana, and St. ochroleuca together as being synonymous because of their white-spore appearance. However, in 1945, Thom and Kenneth Raper (also a scientist at the U.S. Department of Agriculture in Peoria, Illinois) rejected this idea because there were many more white- spored strains found in other genus, and that the white-coloured property alone was not enough reason to group these species together in one category. Today, there are five species that are accepted to be synonymous to A. candidus. (listed in the 'Taxonomy' section) ==Growth and morphology== Aspergillus candidus is exclusively an asexually reproducing species. It is closely related to the darkly pigmented group of aspergilli that includes A. niger, and is in the clade of aspergilli that includes the sexually- reproducing genus, Sterigmatocystis. A. candidus forms typical branching, septate hyphae, which produce conidial heads at maturity. Conidiogenesis is favoured in reduced oxygen atmospheres. Optimal growth of A. candidus occurs at 25-28 °C at 0.016 atm partial pressure of oxygen. Growth of this species has been reported at temperatures as low as 11-13 °C and as high as 41-42 °C. A. candidus is xerophilic, meaning it can grow in low water availability. When grown on stored grains in 15% moisture content, it has the ability to increase the moisture level (up to 18%) and elevate the temperature to as high as 55 °C In the laboratory, ' was observed on media containing substances like p-hydroxy-benzoic aldehyde, lignin sulphonate, and tannin (which contains substances that A. candidus uses and degrades). Aspergillus candidus exhibits a broad range of microscopic and colony morphology. Typically, the colonies of A. candidus are white and conidial heads are globose (spherical) or subglobose (subspherical) producing globose, smooth, thin-walled, conidia. En masse, the conidia are typically white to cream-coloured, but some strains may show a pinkish to reddish purple colour when they absorb the pigment from the sclerotia. By contrast, the closely related species A. niger has darkly pigmented conidia with a rough surface. Some strains of A. candidus make sclerotia in culture, which are nodules consisting of densely aggregated hyphae. Sclerotial production is often induced by incubation under stressful conditions such as relatively low temperature or interference competition from co-culture with other microorganisms. Conidial heads are typically 2.5–4.0 µm in diameter, with phialides either directly attached to the apical swelling of the conidiophore (uniseriate) or situated upon a palisade of basal cells (biseriate) – the latter being the most common presentation. Macroscopically, young A. candidus colonies may have a cottony texture in the outer surface which eventually becomes granular as the fungus matures and produces conidia. A. candidus has been cultivated on both Czapek yeast extract agar (CYA) plates and Malt Extract Agar Oxoid® (MEAOX) plates. The growth morphology of the colonies can be seen in the pictures below. Aspergillus_candidus_cya.pngAspergillus candidus growing on CYA plate Aspergillus_candidus_meaox.pngAspergillus candidus growing on MEAOX plate ==Ecology and physiology== A. candidus is a common type of fungus found worldwide, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. There have been reports of this fungus in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Kuwait, Sri Lanka, South and West Africa, Somalia, Sahara, Libya, Egypt, Syria, Israel, Argentina, Bahamas, New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, China, Central America, Chile, Nepal, and the US, indicating a very wide distribution in the world. A. candidus has been reported as a contaminant of many agricultural food products (such as wheat, oats, barley, corn, and rice), decay matter, soil, fur, compost, dead bees, dung, animal nests, and wood submerged in seawater. The species is also known from indoor environments and has been isolated from air, flooring, carpets, mattresses, and dust. Contamination of maize by A. candidus has been shown to increase fat acidity content from the breakdown maize oil, leading to discoloration of the germ and loss of viability, A. candidus can oxidize tryptamine to traptophol, and use glucose and other sugars in the substrate and converts it into D-mannitol. A. candidus may sometimes cause self-heating which increases the temperature of the contaminated crop, in order to increase its competitiveness with other fungi living in the organism or environment at low relative humidity. There have been cases reported where contamination by A. candidus resulted in an increase in surrounding temperature by 20-26 °C. A. candidus has also been reported to use and degrade straw lignin, arabinoxylan, and cellulose. ==Pathogenicity== Aspergillus candidus has been associated with a variety of diseases such as hypersensitivity diseases, and infectious diseases including aspergillosis, otomycosis, and onychomycosis. The dry conidia produced by A. candidus are easily dispersed in air, leading to inhalation by humans and animals. Once in the lung and lower airway, the fungus induces can induce an allergic response (IgE hypersensitivity response). Organic dust toxic syndrome (ODTS) results from frequent inhalation of large amounts of organic dust containing a mixture of microorganisms often including A. candidus. Immunosuppressed individuals (such as organ transplant recipients and HIV patients) are may be susceptible to infection by A. candidus. Invasive aspergillosis may be caused by A. candidus in humans, particularly in immunocompromised individuals, with high associated mortality. Diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis is difficult due to the non-specific clinical measures and symptoms. Some symptoms include fever, cough, and dyspnea (difficulty breathing). Radiologic examination may reveal an alveolar hemorrhage with the appearance of a nodule. Serum tests may show positive results for galactomannan and beta-D-glucan which are both the cell wall materials for A. candidus. Although these may provide strong evidence for invasive aspergillosis, false positive results are also common because many other fungal pathogens also show similar symptoms test results. If the invasive aspergillosis is kept untreated, the disease can spread from the lungs to any of the organs in the body. Dissemination to the central nervous system is especially fatal, resulting in seizure or stroke. Intravenous oral therapy by voriconazole has been used successfully in the treatment of invasive aspergillosis. Although voriconazole is most recommended, amphotericin B deoxycholate is a suitable alternative option for patients intolerant of voriconazole. Hospital acquired infections by this species have been reported. The reason for this is due to the ability of A. candidus to reside in a wide range of environments, from showerheads to storage tanks and potted plants. The fungus can be observed microscopically in infected tissued mounted in potassium or sodium hydroxide solution containing the fluorescent brightener, calcofluor white, or in fungal-specific tissue stains such as Gomori methenamine silver (GMS) stain. Aspergillus candidus secretes cytotoxic metabolites like terphenyl compounds and terprenins, as well as citrinin and immunotoxic (1→3)-β-D-glucans. In addition to humans, there have also been reports of A. candidus disease in pigs and birds. ==Genome sequencing== The genome of A. candidus was sequenced in 2014 as a part of the Aspergillus whole-genome sequencing project - a project dedicated to performing whole- genome sequencing of all members of the genus Aspergillus.Kjaerbolling I, Vesth TC, Frisvad JC, Nybo JL, Theobald S, Kuo A, Bowyer P, Matsuda Y, Mondo S, Lyhne EK, Kogle ME, Clum A, Lipzen A, Salamov A, Ngan CY, Daum C, Chiniquy J, Barry K, LaButti K, Haridas S, Simmons BA, Magnuson JK, Mortensen UH, Larsen TO, Grigoriev IV, Baker SE, Andersen MR.

Her first name comes from the place where she belongs to. She started her career as a theater artist. Later she became a supporting actress in the Malayalam movies in late 1960s and 1970s. She has acted in more than 50 movies. She was the first woman to act in a malyalam movies and dramas from the Muslim community. ==Biography== Ayisha was born in 1935 at Nilambur, a rustic village in the Malappuram District of Kerala. She belonged to a rich family with \\"lots of servants and an elephant\\". Ayisha’s father and brother were interested in the arts. Her father would order all the servants to stop work at 4 p.m. That was the time for them to showcase their talents, be it in music, dance or acting. These moments gave Ayisha a platform to showcase her talents and nurture her skills. She was interested in arts and used to sing a bit. But after the death of her father, her family went into a deep financial crisis and they lived in abject poverty. She was also a victim of child marriage. At the age of 13, she was made to marry a 47-year old man. But the brave woman called off the marriage at the fifth day, unable to bear his torture. One day, not being able to cope up with the severe bruises life has inflicted upon her heart and soul, she decided to commit suicide. Only because of the sudden interference of her elder brother she did change her mind and determined to face all odds with courage. Later she realised that she is pregnant, but she did raise the baby on her own. ==Acting Career== Ayisha, a Muslim woman, entered the stage in the 1950s when it was taboo for a Muslim woman to do so. E.M.S. Namboodiripad, one of the founding leaders of the Communist Party in Kerala, played a key role in Ayisha becoming an actor. Those were the days when all female roles were played by men and very few women dared to act. E.M.S who once came to watch a play by E.K Ayamu suggested that it would be great if the female characters in the play are performed by female artists. Inspired by this Ayamu and his team started searching all around Nilambur for female artists who are apt for the roles. They selected Janaki, the nephew of renowned actor Nilambur Balan for a role. But they were unable to find a suitable face for Jameela, a pivotal character in the play. One day Ayamu who had an unexpected visit to Ayisha’s house with her brother accidentally witnessed the talent of Ayisha who was acting in front of the mirror in tune with a song from the gramophone. Deeply impressed by her charm and acting skills, Ayamu turned to her brother and told – ‘Here is our Jameela’. Then both of them insisted her to act in their play. Despite of the objection from her mother, Ayisha took the plunge and made her debut before a huge crowd at Feroke, in 1953 at the age of 16 with playwright E.K. Ayamu’s ‘Ijju Nalloru Manushyan Aavan Nokku’ (1953), a populist play that shook up social sensibilities. Performed at over 2,500 stages in various parts of the State and in Bombay and Pune, the play drew huge crowds, including artists, writers and thinkers. Later she went on to work with stalwarts in theatre such as K.T. Mohammed, Vaikom Mohammed Basheer, Khan Kavil and P.J. Antony. She played the lead in plays such as Ithu Bhoomiyanu, Theekkanal, Srishti and Kafir written and directed by K.T Muhammed. Ayisha was not just a presence. She was a firebrand. She along with her troop members went from village to village inviting people to watch their plays, which called for revolution, fighting feudalism. The plays she starred in were all about social changes and were a huge crowd puller nonetheless. By her late teens, she had become a talking point, finding her way into newspaper headlines and contemptuous whispers. But some section of the society was not acceptable to a woman taking part in plays. To them it was inconceivable that a Muslim girl from a conservative family in Malappuram could become a theatre actor. Her family was promptly ostracised, but she continued to act. Despite she was pelted at several times while on stage, getting hit again on her forehead, Ayisha remained unflinching. The opposition from her community rose each day. Once, she was shot at with an airgun while performing in one of K.T. Mohammed’s plays in Manjeri. By sheer luck, she escaped. Another time, while performing at Mannarkad, a man from the audience went up to her and slapped her. Since then, she has lost her hearing in one ear. But the determined woman overcame all resistance with her sheer grit and grace. Her love for acting consumed all of her, keeping her grounded to her passion. In ‘Ee Duniyaavil Njan Ottakkanu’ (I’m alone in this world), written by Dr. Usman, she brought her sister Amina to the stage. Opposition continued. ==From Stage to Silver Screen== She did not limit herself to plays, she has made a foray into film. Ayisha’s first film was in Hindi, The Elephant Queen, directed by Rajendra. The film’s cast included Helen and Azad. She played the role of a woman in a hunting family. She got an entry to that film because it was shot at Nilambur, her hometown. That year she also did her first film in Malayalam, Kandam Becha Kottu, which was a big hit. It was followed by films like Subaida, Kuttikkuppayam, Olavum Theeravum and Kuppivala. She acted with the biggest stars of those days such as Prem Nazir, Sheela, Ambika, Adoor Bhasi and Bahadoor. ==Life in Exile== Then one day she was summarily dismissed from K.T.’s Sangamam Theatre. It was also the time the Muslim community rose with full vigour against her theatre activism. Religious fanatics hounded her. Days of hunger and poverty followed. The community had forbidden people from helping her. But good Samaritans such as Kunhi Kuttan Thampan of the royal family of Nilambur and Dr. M. Usman, both social visionaries and patrons of the arts, offered refuge to her. Actor Nilambur Balan has also supported her. Out of work as a theatre artiste, she went to Saudi Arabia to work as a khaddama (housemaid) for 20 years. She began to act again on her return from the Gulf. Director Ranjith was instrumental in giving her another innings in films, with a robust character in Ammakkilikoodu, which he wrote. Then she played some meaty roles in films such as Paradeshi, in which I played Lakshmi Gopalaswamy’s mother. ==Awards and honours== Ayisha’s first honour came the same year she started acting (1953). She was called ‘Keralathile Veeraputhri’. The most prominent among the awards she has received are the S.L. Puram State Prize for her overall contribution to theatre. She won the Kerala State Film Award for the Second Best Actress for her role in Oomakkuyil Paadumbol in 2011. She was also awarded the coveted Premji Award in the year 2011.She is also a winner of Premji Award, SL Puram Award, KPAC Award etc. Still at this age of 82, Ayisha retains the fire within. She attends workshops and debates on social issues and women’s empowerment. Nilambur Ayisha is seen as one of the most inspiring personalities of the industry. She has certainly inspired generations with her struggle to fight for their passion. It was Nilambur Aysha's move against the opposition of Muslim orthodoxy that paved the way for several other Muslim women to take up acting and singing. Zeenath was one of the actresses she inspired. Ayisha is nothing short of a revolution. With the kind of respect, women are getting in the entertainment industry today; this might be making her proud today! ==Partial filmography== *Halal Love Story (2020) as actress in telefilm *Udalazham (2019) as Housemaid *Mamangam (2019) as old woman in Chandroth family *OP Kakshi Amminipilla (2019) as Quarrelling lady at court *Virus (2019) as Staff of OP Counter, Hospital *Panthu (2019) as Amina's grandmother *Koode (2018) as Grandmother *Khalifa (2018) *Mattanchery (2018) *Hello Dubaikkaran (2017) as Prakashan's grandmother *Ka Bodyscapes (2016) as Kadeesumma *Pravasalokam (2016) as Najeeb's Ammayi *Nikkah (2015) as Aasiyumma *Compartment (2015) as Devi *Alif (2015) as Ummakunju/Fathima's grandmother *Pedithondan (2014) as Umma *Koothara (2014) as Thufail's mother *Balyakalasakhi (2014) as Jinnumma *Ms. Lekha Tharoor Kanunnathu (2013) as Deceased patient in hospital *Bioscope (2013) *Oomakkuyil Padumbol (2012) as Mansoor's umma *Olappurakkendhinoru Irumbuvaathil as *Nilavinte Muthu *Njangalude Veedu *Oru Manjukalam as Lakshmikuttiyamma *Khubboos *Keralolsavam 2009 (2009) as Basheer's umma *Paleri Manikyam: Oru Pathirakolapathakathinte Katha (2009) *Passenger (2009) as Nabisa Umma *Vilapangalkkappuram (2008) as Valyumma *Shalabham (2008) as Villager *Shakespeare M.A. Malayalam (2008) as Mentally challenged man's mother *Kaiyoppu (2007) as Beeyathu *Paradesi (2007) as Sainu *Daivanamathil (2005) as Ammayi *Makalkku (2005) as Mental patient *Chandrolsavam (2005) as Indu's mother *Ammakkilkoodu (2003) as Inmate of old age home *Mylanji (1982) (Ayishumma) *Thraasam (1981) *Anyarude Bhoomi (1979) *Nalumanipookkal (1979) *Thenthulli (1979) *Chuvanna Vithukal (1978) *Kaathirunna Nimisham (1978) as Ramu's mother *Pathiraavum Pakalvelichavum (1974) *Olavum Theeravum (1970) as Ayisha *Chemmeen (1966) *Thankakkudam (1965) as Payasakkaran's wife *Kavyamela (1965) as Bhavaniyamma *Thommante Makkal (1965) *Kattupookkal (1965) *Kaathirunna Nikkah (1965) as Amina *Kuppivala (1965) as Pathiri Aminumma *Subaidha (1965) as Subaidha's mother *Kutti Kuppayam (1964) *Laila Majnu (1962) *Kandam Becha Kottu (1961) as Bethatha *Elephant (1961) as Woman in hunting family (Hindi film) ==TV Serials== * Rudraveena (Surya TV) ==Dramas== * Karinkurangu * Ithu Bhoomiyanu * Ullathu Paranjal * Ee Dhuniyavil Njan Ottakkanu * Ijj Nalla Manushyanavan Nokk * Kafir * Theekkanal * Srishti ==References*Nilambur Ayisha at MSI Category:Actresses in Malayalam cinema Category:Indian film actresses Category:Actresses from Kerala Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:People from Malappuram district Category:20th-century Indian actresses Category:21st-century Indian actresses Category:Actresses in Malayalam television ","title":"Nilambur Ayisha"},{"id":"42062555","text":"Puberty Medley () is a 2013 South Korean television miniseries starring Kwak Dong-yeon, Lee Se-young, Kwak Jung-wook, Choi Tae-joon, Park Jung-min, Bae Noo-ri and Yoon Park. A coming-of-age teen drama about students at a village high school, it was adapted from the webtoon of the same title written by Kwak In-geun, which was published on Daum WebToon from November 9, 2011 to February 29, 2012. It aired as part of the Drama Special Series anthology on KBS2 from July 10 to July 31, 2013 on Sundays at 23:10 for four episodes. ==Synopsis== Choi Jung-woo (Baek Sung-hyun) is a part-timer village high school teacher who is still waiting for the results of the licensure examination for teachers. With his fate in the licensure still undetermined, he works for the meantime in his alma mater, the Namil High School. Being at Namil High School, Jung-woo is reminded of his adolescent life ten years ago. He also keeps on receiving e-mails from his former classmates and acquaintances. Upon opening in his laptop a gallery of his high school photos, he reminisces his colorful high school life when he was still a teenage boy who unexpectedly gained instant fame in Namil High. ==EpisodesEpisode 1 (Transfer Student)=== Ten years ago, teenage Choi Jung-woo (Kwak Dong-yeon) is the new student at Namil High School. After transferring schools seven times because of his father's job, Jung-woo has learned to live like an \\"invisible man\\" and is determined not to make friends. But Yang Ah-young (Lee Se-young), the smart and seemingly aloof Class President, is actually full of empathy, so she nags him into doing many school chores, which annoys Jung-woo. Meanwhile, his shy seatmate Im Deok-won (Kwak Jung-wook) is being bullied by senior student Shin Young-bok (Park Jung- min) into doing errands for him. At first, Jung-woo does not want to get involved, but he ends up yelling and throwing a bag of snacks at Young-bok, that unfortunately lands on someone else walking along the corridor. This happens to be the school's toughest student and aspiring boxer Lee Yeok-ho, a.k.a. Brown Bear (Choi Tae-joon), who challenges Jung-woo to a one-on-one fight. Jung-woo's instant fame heightens when he takes revenge on Ah-young by asking her out. To his shock, Ah-young accepts his offer instead, making their classmates overjoyed and most people at Namil High, including the senior bullies, going ballistic about this new “class couple.\\" When Jung-woo learns that his father will be transferred to Seoul in a few days, he volunteers to join the National Singing Contest which everyone avoids, thinking that he will be in Seoul by the time Yeok-ho hunts him down and the singing contest commences. But his nightmare continues when Jung-woo's father decides not to transfer to Seoul after all and tells his family that they are staying in Namil. Jung-woo has no other choice but to face all his challenges head-on. ===Episode 2 (It's a Secret)=== When Jung-woo learns from Deok-won that the bully Young-bok is hunting him down, he escapes at noontime and goes with Ah- young to have their lunch. He learns that the entire village already knew that he is the contender for the National Singing Contest. Jung-woo also receives another threat from Young-bok, making him think of plans on how to overcome the senior bullies. He signs up for a training in the village's boxing gym, but he escapes hastily upon learning that it was the place where Yeok-ho does his training. Later, while walking home together, Ah-young asks Jung-woo why he asked her out. In response, Jung-woo, who is starting to have feelings for her, tells her that it is a secret and kisses her. Back at school, Ah-young hesitatingly joins her female classmates in playing a paranormal game where they can ask questions to the school ghost. When the paper they used in the game rips upon questioning the “ghost” if Ah-young has found her soulmate (assuming it was Jung-woo), Ah-young's classmates claim that she will be temporarily haunted by this “ghost” later at night. Though unbelieving in the paranormal, Ah-young is scared by the thought of seeing ghosts and enlists Jung-woo's help in illegally breaking into the school at night to get her “notes.” While Jung-woo and Ah-young search inside their classroom, Young-bok and fellow senior Lee Won-il (Yoon Park) plan to take revenge against Jung-woo by putting a box of cigarettes and a bottle of liquor in his desk. Before the bullies arrive, Ah-young finds her notes (which was actually the ripped paper used in the ghost game) and escapes through the window, Jung-woo jumping out first. Young-bok and Won-il arrive at the classroom just in time to see Ah- young jump from the window. Since Ah-young's back was facing them and she was also clad in white, they think it was the school ghost and scream loudly. They arouse the school's security personnel in the process and are caught with the cigarettes and the liquor. In another walk towards home, Jung-woo sings to Ah- young the song he chose to perform in the National Singing Contest. Though she considers the song to lack emotion, Ah-young is secretly touched and offers Jung-woo her help in the production of his piece. She also requests Jung-woo to sing a song that will surely cheer her up. ===Episode 3 (Qualifications of a Man)=== Meanwhile, Yeok-ho meets up with the members of a gang he was previously affiliated with, along with Young-bok and Won-il. Though he can actually handle them all by himself, he rejects in putting up a fight against them, so the gang members beat him up. Won-il, who is bitter towards Yeok-ho, enjoys seeing the fight but Young-bok interferes and tries to help. Deok-won, along with Jung-woo, happens to pass by and helps Yeok-ho, whom he realized was actually kind-hearted despite his rough features. Jung-woo attempts to stop the fight but is threatened by Won-il, who tells him about a secret relationship between Yeok-ho and Ah-young. Dejectedly, he runs away, making him look like a coward. Ashamed of himself, Jung-woo distances himself from Ah-young but learns that Yeok-ho is actually protecting Ah-young from Wo-nil, who was one of her former suitors. Jung-woo decides, later on, to finally accept Yeok-ho's challenge through a boxing match. They agreed that Jung-woo wins if he is able to strike Yeok-ho down even once. Meanwhile, the village has suffered heavy rains which caused the river to swell and their bridge to collapse. In the disaster, Young-bok and his younger sister, who were crossing the bridge at night, fall into the rapids. Jung-woo, Deok-won, and Yeok-ho's grandfather luckily arrives at the scene and saves them from getting drowned. Later, Jung-woo learns that Yeok-ho is orphaned for long and that he trained under Ah-young's older brother, the late Yang Young-woong (Lee Jong-hyun) who died after saving people during a severe flood in Namil years ago. Soon after, Jung-woo faces Yeok-ho for their boxing duel, with Ah-young and their schoolmates watching. After being battered for three rounds, Jung-woo is able to make a decisive punch on Yeok-ho, shocking everyone in the court. ===Episode 4 (Your Voice Ringing in My Ears)=== After the boxing match, Jung- woo braces himself for the upcoming National Singing Contest, with the help of Deok-won and his fellow schoolmates as the musicians. Ah-young, who thinks she cannot watch the contest for herself, asks Yeok-ho if he could do it for her. On the day of the singing contest, Jung-woo's team wins the first prize. Yeok- ho, who was attending another boxing training, arrives late at the venue and finds out the Ah-young had come to watch the contest ahead of him, though both of them were not able to see the performance. Shortly, Ah-young spends intimate moments with Jung-woo and gives him her guitar and bicycle, both of which were actually precious to her. When Jung-woo gets curious, she reveals to him that she will be transferring out to Seoul, saddening him. A day before she transfers, Ah-young expresses her gratitude for Jung-woo and kisses him. Jung-woo have never met her again since that time. Upon Ah-young's transfer, Jung-woo is appointed as the new class president. Sincerely missing her, Jung- woo comes upon Ah-young's diary which contains her affection for him which she had actually kept secret all along. In Seoul, Ah-young gets teary-eyed in happiness upon watching Jung-woo's song revealed in a TV replay of the National Singing Contest. The performance cheers everyone in the venue as what Jung-woo had promised to do. Back to present time, Jung-woo gets emotional and confused upon seeing a number of e-mails he received from Ah-young. The results of the licensure examinations are released and Jung-woo is one of the lucky passers, prompting him to continue his career in Namil High School. On the closing scene of the series, while walking home, Jung-woo hears a woman's voice calling his name. Turning around, he smiles with longing at the familiar woman who called him. ==CastMain=== * Kwak Dong-yeon as Choi Jung-woo ** Baek Sung-hyun as adult Choi Jung-woo ** Kim Kyung-min as middle school student Choi Jung-woo (ep 1) ** Lee Joon-myung as elementary school student Choi Jung-woo (ep 1) * Lee Se-young as Yang Ah-young ** Yoo Da-mi as adult Yang Ah-young (ep 4) * Kwak Jung-wook as Im Deok-won * Choi Tae-joon as Lee Yeok-ho * Park Jung-min as Shin Young-bok * Bae Noo-ri as Jang Hyun-jin * Yoon Park as Lee Won-il ===Supporting=== * Jung In-gi as Jung-woo's father * Go Soo-hee as Jung-woo's mother * Oh Yoon-hong as Ah-young's mother * Jung Soo- young as Jung-woo and Ah-young's homeroom teacher * Go Bo-gyeol as Gou-ri * Kwon Mina as Yoon Jin-young, Ah-young's friend * Yoon Joo-sang as Yeok-ho's grandfather and small store owner * Ahn Ji-hyun as Moon Soo-jung, Ah-young's friend * Kim Dong-hee as Park Sung-tae, Jung-woo's friend * Woo Seung-min as Deok-hoon * Geum Bo as Jung-woo and Ah-young's classmate * Lee Kyu-in as Jung- woo's elementary school classmate (ep 1) * Kim Hwan-hee as Young-bok's younger sister (ep 3) * Song Hae as himself, MC of National Singing Contest (cameo, ep 1, 4) * Lee Jong-hyun as Yang Young-woong, Ah-young's older brother (cameo, ep 2-3) * Lee Sung-yeol (Infinite) as student council president (cameo, ep 2) ==Ratings== { class=  - !rowspan=\\"3\\" !rowspan=\\"3\\"Episode title !rowspan=\\"3\\"Broadcast date !colspan=\\"4\\"Average audience share - !colspan=\\"2\\"TNmS !colspan=\\"2\\"AGB Nielsen - !width=90Nationwide !width=90Seoul !width=90Nationwide !width=90Seoul -  1  Transfer Student  10 July 2013 2.9% <8.4% 3.3% <7.8% -  2  It's a Secret  17 July 2013 2.5% <8.0% 2.6% <8.0% -  3  Qualifications of a Man  24 July 2013 2.2% <8.4% 2.6% <7.9% -  4  Your Voice Ringing in My Ears  31 July 2013 2.5% <9.2% 2.1% <8.0% - ! colspan=3  Average  2.5%  -  2.7%  - } ==Awards and nominations== {  - !

Number 4 indicates the part of the building that accommodated a telescope by Cauchoix. Robert-Aglaé Cauchoix (24 April 1776 – 5 February 1845) was a French optician and instrument maker, whose lenses played a part in the race of the great refractor telescopes in the first half of the 19th century. ==Instruments== At first Cauchoix produced a wide range of scientific instruments including barometers and micrometers, but he soon specialized in optics, making spherometers and objectives. He made a telescope for the Paris Observatory in 1820 and in 1825 he made a 6.5 inch (16.5 cm) refractor for the observatory of the Collegio Romano, a Jesuit academy in Rome. In the Royal Observatory, Greenwich an 1838 instrument named the Sheepshanks telescope includes an objective by Cauchoix. The Sheepshanks had a 6.7 inch (17 cm) wide lens, and was the biggest telescope at Greenwich for about twenty years. An 1840 report from the Observatory noted of the then- new Sheepshanks telescope with the Cauchoix doublet: ==Great refractors== Although the reflector telescope was invented in the second half of the 18th century, technological difficulties made the refractor the telescope of choice until the mid-1850s. Improvements in lens production, like the introduction of the achromatic lens by John Dollond, spawned an aperture size race that started in the early 1820s with a telescope made by the German optician Joseph von Fraunhofer. Cauchoix must be credited holding the lens size record three times this period. In 1831, Cauchoix made a 13.3 inch (almost 33.8 cm) refractor for the Irishman Edward Joshua Cooper, who used it to observe Halley's Comet in 1835 and a solar eclipse in 1836. In 1829, Cauchoix made an 11.75 inch lens for a French customer, but sold it to the British astronomer James South. South used it for his new telescope, which he found defective due to problems with the equatorial mount. In 1838, this telescope was dismantled, but the lens by Cauchoix served in other instruments until 1989. ==See also== * List of astronomical instrument makers ==References * Picture of Edward Cooper's telescope, London Science Museum.

The Nature Park & Galleries (NPG; Hebrew: שדרות טבע וגלריות), is the “open-air campus museum” of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, located on the University's Edmund J. Safra Science Campus in Jerusalem, Israel. ==Overview== Established in 2003, NPG shares the University's knowledge and ideas with the public. NPG began by interpreting for visitors objects and activities already present on campus. Later it commenced, and continues, implementing major permanent displays, as at most museums, mostly out of doors. Initially visitors were led by trained student guides, whereas now visitors guide themselves, using several interpretive formats. Originally a fee was charged for scheduled tours, now the museum is free and open all hours every day. Published research by NPG focuses on novel ways of enhancing visitor experiences in different types of destinations.

Judy Siegel. The Jerusalem Post, 2004-07-29\\"A 'natural' way of learning\\". Judy Siegel-Itzkovich. The Jerusalem Post, 2003-10-12 ==History and operation== The Nature Park & Galleries opened to the public in August 2003. As originally conceived, it operated a set of guided programs on approximately ten (later fifteen) different subjects. Each program, lasting about one hour, took place on the Edmund J. Safra Science Campus of the Hebrew University. These programs included walking tours, sit- down demonstrations, behind-the-scenes visits and workshops, each for a fee. The guides, mostly graduate students, were trained in guiding by a masters- level university course. Underlying these developments lay the concept that the Edmund J. Safra Campus (and no doubt many other university campuses) already was a museum – or almost. Collections available for NPG's guided tours included the National Collections of Natural History,National Collections of Natural History, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel. the National Library of Israel, the Albert Einstein Archive,Albert Einstein Archive. the Magnes Press,Magnes Press. forefront research laboratories, the campus architecture, trees and gardens. All that was needed for turning this into a museum was a means of interpreting these and other campus features – that is, to tell their \\"stories\\" – for the public. The student tour guides provided that interpretation. Beginning in 2013, NPG changed its approach to interpretation. No longer are student-guided programs offered. Rather, an array of means for self-guiding was developed, including brochures, guide books, smart-phone audio-guides, and permanent signage. NPG is now open to all, for free, at any time. According to NPG's Founding Director, Professor Emeritus Jeff Camhi (Kimchi) of the university's Life Sciences Institute, the switch from student guides to a self guiding framework brings the NPG experience in line with the most common way people visit museums around the world. This switch also offers greater financial sustainability, and exposure to a wider visiting public. NPG functions as a unit of the Hebrew University's Authority for Community and Youth, but carries out its own fund-raising. ==Exhibits== NPG has implemented several permanent museum displays on the campus.\\"A 3000 Years Old Sequoia Trunk in the Hebrew University of Jerusalem's Museum\\". Yuval Dror, HaAretz, 2003-10-21 (Hebrew) A part of the Bird Migration Walk exhibition. *Plant Evolution Garden: In this garden, one walks through 500 million years of plant history. Signs explain the major turning points in plant evolution and direct the visitor's view toward features of the living plants that illustrate these turning points. Among the turning points featured are vegetation's initial movement from water to land, the later development of roots, leaves, and vertical growth, the first seed plants, early conifers and early flowering plants, and adaptations to moist, and to arid environments by modern plants. A part of the Ecology Boardwalk. * Bird Migration Trail: Fifty birds, sculpted in bronze, painted true to life, and permanently installed among the campus gardens, are the work of Israeli artist and bird fancier Roi Shinar. The fifty are divided into four separate displays, according to the season of their annual appearance on campus. The four are: Autumn arrivals from Europe and Asia; Spring arrivals from Africa; Autumn and spring stop-over birds in transit between Eurasia and Africa; Permanent resident birds. Explanatory signs give each bird's English, Hebrew and scientific name. * Ecology Boardwalk: The 8-acre forest in the heart of campus looks disorderly compared to the neatly planned campus gardens. But, as the signage soon to be installed along this 300 meter boardwalk explains, forests have their own order. *Discovery Tree Walk: NPG highlights 50 campus trees, originating from six continents. The stories told in the signs, guide book, and smart-phone audio-guide are partly botanical, partly historic, folkloric, biblical, commercial, and aesthetic. The signage is interactive – each sign tells the tree's “story”, asks a short question about the tree and provides its answer. *Sequoia Slice: A slice, taken from the trunk of a fallen 2000-year-old Giant Sequoia tree from California, has been permanently installed on campus by NPG. It stands besides Israel's oldest living Sequoia tree. Among the features of this trunk slice are evidences of several fires during the past twenty centuries, and recovery by the trees's subsequent growth. * Exhibit in Planning: NPG is currently developing a new permanent exhibit on the scientific research carried out on campus. Opening expected summer, 2015. ==Publications== NPG publishes books interpreting the treasures of the Safra Campus: *Michael Avishai and Jeff Camhi, \\"Fifty Tree Tales: Edmond J.

As she drives down a forested road, she almost hits a doe and two fawns with her car. Meanwhile, her husband Philip Jennings (Matthew Rhys), posing as an American agent, is arranging a weapons deal with two Afghans (an elder and a young interpreter) in a Middle Eastern restaurant. The interpreter presents Phillip with a knife, which he claims was used to kill his first Soviet soldier. Phillip accepts the knife and then shoots both Afghans, killing the elder and wounding the interpreter. He leaves the wounded interpreter a message: no one, not even Allah, can protect them as the KGB are everywhere. As Phillip attempts to leave, the interpreter attacks him. Phillip kills the interpreter and then the busboy before escaping from the restaurant. The next morning, The Jennings throw a birthday party for their son Henry (Keidrich Sellati). During the party, Phillip gives his neighbor, FBI agent Stan Beeman, a refund for the trip he had arranged as a reconciliation attempt with his wife. Stan remarks that it is good to see that Phillip and Elizabeth are now back together; Phillip advises Stan to give his own marital relationship time. Philip and Elizabeth prepare to leave on a date, which disappoint Henry as it's his birthday. He relents when his sister Paige (Holly Taylor) expresses acceptance of their parents' need for some time alone together. The date, however, is a cover for a mission assisting another Soviet spy couple, Emmett and Leanne Connors. Posing as Air Force security, Phillip and Emmett burst into a hotel room where Elizabeth and Leanne are having sex with Roy, a Lockheed employee who is involved in a Skunk Works project. Philip and Emmett confront Roy with the suspicious circumstances of his current sexual encounter. They then offer to \\"protect\\" Roy provided he reveal his security protocols in life and at Lockheed, report future phone logs and contacts, and use the various codes they provide for his office work. Later at a construction site, Elizabeth and Leanne discuss their current lives. They are joined by Phillip and Emmett, who reveal the date-mission to be a success. The two couples reminisce about their children's youth and how quickly they grow up. They decide to go to the amusement park the next day to see each other and their kids. Paige grows increasingly suspicious of her parents' activities. Later that night, she opens their bedroom door, only to find them having mutual oral sex. After an awkward breakfast the next morning, Philip wonders if it is the first time Paige has ever checked on the couple. At the FBI counterintelligence office, Agent Frank Gaad (Richard Thomas) orders Stan to stop being so fixated on the Illegals couple that escaped. Gaad asks Stan to trust his source, Nina (Annet Mahendru), who had claimed that the woman had died of her injuries and the man had been exfiltrated. Sanford storms into headquarters to demand his $500,000. Stan tells him he will not get his money because none of his information could be verified. Colonel Rennhull has been cleared, but Stan remains suspicious. With the help of another FBI agent, Stan takes a bootlegged copy of The French Lieutenant's Woman for a date night with Nina. Nina is displeased with the film. She tells him of a new arrival at the Rezidentura, Oleg Igorevich Burov, who is responsible for spying on science and technology. The next day, Sanford goes to Colonel Rennhull's house and is supposedly killed by the Colonel in self-defense. At the crime scene, Stan observes the two bullet holes in Sanford's head and remarks to Gaad, \\"You'd think one in the head would have been enough.\\" At the amusement park, Emmett covertly contacts Philip and asks him to do a brush pass with an unnamed agent (John Carroll Lynch), explaining that he cannot do it himself because he might be recognized by the surveillance team following the man. He instructs Philip to use Henry as a prop that will be recognized by the agent, and will avoid alerting the surveillance team. Leanne and their children will then block for Philip. Philip is initially reluctant to involve their own children, but relents and carries out the task successfully. Philip and Elizabeth go to Emmett and Leanne's hotel room to drop off the package. They are shocked to find the couple and their 15-year-old daughter, Amelia, shot dead. Philip tells Elizabeth to get their own kids, and retrieves a notebook with codes from Emmett's luggage. He walks out of the hotel room and passes by Emmett's teenage son, Jared. Philip leaves, Jared walks into the room and screams in horror. Elizabeth and Philip frantically retrieve their kids from the park and go home. That night, Philip decodes Emmett's information and Elizabeth is extremely paranoid. Philip regrets using Henry as a prop and putting him in danger, but Elizabeth forgives him. She tells him he has to spend the night as planned with Martha, the FBI employee whom he married under another identity. Stan comes home early from work. His wife Sandra warms up to him and asks him to go to the movies with her. Coincidentally, the film is The French Lieutenant's Woman. The episode ends with Philip, disguised as FBI counterintelligence agent Clark, lying with Martha and talking about his job, stating that \\"it gets to you in ways you didn't think it would\\". Meanwhile, Elizabeth watches out the window anxiously. ==Production== The episode was written by Joel Fields and series creator Joe Weisberg and directed by Thomas Schlamme. ==Reception== Comrades received critical acclaim.

The play was the third of several successes by Robertson produced in London's West End by Squire Bancroft and his wife Marie Wilton. As its name suggests, Caste concerns distinctions of class and rank. The son of a French nobleman marries a ballet dancer and then goes to war. When word arrives that he has been killed in action, his mother tries to wrest the child from his penniless widow. ==History and early productions== Illustrator Frank R. Grey sketched scenes from the 1915 film adaption of Caste for Pictures and The Picturegoer magazine (March 4, 1916) Caste is based on the short story \\"The Poor Rate Unfolds a Tale\\", written by Thomas William Robertson in 1866 for Rates and Taxes, a Christmas publication edited by Tom Hood.Full text of Society and Caste edited by T. Edgar Pemberton (1905), www.archive.org. Accessed 22 August 2016 The play was first seen on 6 April 1867 at the Prince of Wales' Theatre, produced by Squire Bancroft and his wife, the actress Marie Wilton, to whom it was dedicated. They had produced Robertson's plays Society in 1865 and Ours in 1866. These plays are written, and were directed, in a naturalistic style that was novel for the time, in which the characters behave like real people, with settings and stage properties that add realism to the drama. The actors were in sympathy with this style, and the plays were successful. Caste, in the same vein, was particularly enduring; during the next few years it was revived three times at the same theatre, totalling 650 performances under the Bancroft management. via www.archive.org. W. S. Gilbert's one-act farce Allow Me to Explain (1867) ran as a companion piece to Caste.Robinson, Arthur. \\"Allow Me To Explain\\", Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, 27 November 1996, accessed 27 February 2014 The popularity of Caste led to further Robertson and Bancroft successes: Play (1868), School (1869), and M.P. (1870). A reviewer of the opening night of the play wrote: > Society and Ours prepared the way for a complete reformation of the modern > drama, and until the curtain fell on Saturday night it remained a question > whether Mr. Robertson would be able to hold the great reputation which those > pieces conferred upon him.

The whole secret of > his success is truth! ==Synopsis== Act I \\"The little house in Stangate — Courtship.\\" In 1867, Captain George D'Alroy, whose mother is the Marquise de St. Maur, is in love with the beautiful ballet dancer Esther Eccles, who comes from a poor family. He wants advice and brings his fellow officer Captain Hawtree to meet Esther. Hawtree says, \\"the thing is out of the question.... Caste! – the inexorable law of caste! The social law... that commands like to mate with like\\". Esther's father comes in. He is a drunkard and does not work; he leaves when George gives him a half sovereign. Esther and her sister Polly (also a ballet dancer) arrive and they get tea ready. Polly establishes a friendly banter with Hawtree as he helps. Sam Gerridge, Polly's young man, takes a dislike to Hawtree, and after Hawtree leaves, Sam says, \\"People should stick to their own class. Life's a railway journey, and Mankind's a passenger – first class, second class, third class.\\" Esther gets a letter to say she has got an engagement for work in Manchester, and George, not wanting her to leave, asks her to marry him. \\"A lapse of eight months.\\" Act II \\"The lodgings in Mayfair — Matrimony.\\" George and Esther are married. He tries to get the courage to tell her he must leave to join his regiment; Hawtree comes to see if he is ready. George's mother the Marquise, who does not know he is married, visits. She knows he is to go on active service, and, since she is of a family of soldiers, quotes passages from the Chronicles of Froissart. Esther, in the next room, overhears their conversation and comes in, fainting. The Marquise learns of the marriage and meets Esther, Polly, Sam and Mr Eccles, all of whom she regards with contempt; they react indignantly. George and Hawtree leave to join their regiment and go to India. \\"A lapse of twelve months.\\" Act III \\"The little house in Stangate — Widowhood.\\" Esther is told that George has been killed in India. She moves home to Stangate to live with her fiery-tempered sister Polly, because the money left to her was lost by her father on gambling. She has a baby and wonders if she will ever find love again. Polly is expecting to marry Sam, and he has gone into business as a gasfitter. The Marquise arrives; she got a letter from Mr Eccles saying that Esther needed assistance. She wants to take the baby back with her, but Esther refuses. Mr Eccles is disappointed when the Marquise goes without leaving any money. Esther goes to lie down. Sam asks Mr Eccles if he can marry Polly, and he acquiesces when Sam (unnoticed by Polly) says he would supply him with alcohol and tobacco. George, not dead in spite of reports, arrives and meets Polly and Sam. Polly breaks the news to Esther, while George is out of the room, by acting excerpts from the ballet Jeanne la folle, or, the Return of the Soldier, which Esther remembers. George explains that he was taken prisoner in India but managed to escape. The Marquise is overjoyed that her son has returned, and is reconciled to Esther. Hawtree, however, who is now a Major but has no title, gets a letter informing him that the girl he hoped to marry, daughter of a countess, is to marry a son of a marquis – Caste has thwarted him. He says, \\"Best to marry in your own rank of life.\\" George says, \\"But if ever you find the girl, marry her.\\" ==Original cast== John Hare as Eccles in Caste (1915) * Hon.

Like many other fungi belonging to the genus Aspergillus, it can be mildly pathogenic but has a number of useful potential applications in medicine and the production of foodstuffs.Mikiharu Doi (2013). Toko, Kiyoshi, ed. Biochemical sensors: mimicking gustatory and olfactory senses, Chapter 8: Investigation into the Kokumi Taste of Soup Stock Materials. Singapore: Pan Stanford. p. 123. . == History and taxonomy == Botanical reference to this fungus seems to begin with Micheli, who in 1729 used the generic name Aspergillus, derived from aspergillum (holy water sprinkler) to describe the filamentous nature of this group of fungi.Bennett JW (2010). \\"An Overview of the Genus Aspergillus\\" (PDF). Aspergillus: Molecular Biology and Genomics. Caister Academic Press. . The fungus was later described as Mucor glaucus in 1753 before being moved to the genus Aspergillus in 1809, where it took on its current name of Aspergillus glaucus.Species Plantarum: 1186 (1753)Mag. Gesell. naturf. Freunde, Berlin 3(1-2): 16 (1809) Other names are also quite common, namely Aspergillus herbariorium and its teleomorph synonym, Eurotium herbariorium. == Physiology and morphology == Aspergillus glaucus is a very robust xerophilic fungus capable of surviving in a wide variety of different environments due to features of its physiology. Firstly, the fungus has a cardinal temperature range between 4 °C and 37 °C, allowing it to grow well during winter. The optimal temperature range for growth, however, is between 24 °C and 25 °C. With these temperatures, growth is considered moderate, reaching maturity in about one to three weeks. It is also one of the most osmotolerant fungi in its genus, being capable of developing at a sucrose concentration of 60%, allowing it to grow in very sweet syrups and foodstuffs. The fungus itself is filamentous and thin-walled. and has many features in common with other species in its genus, namely its conidial heads, which radiate to somewhat columnar and are round or elliptical. These conidial heads are typically sized between 5 and 6.5 μm.[null Mould Allergy], Yousef Al-Doory and Joanne F. Domson, Lea and Febiger, Philadelphia, 1984. 287 p. The conidiophores containing them, typically 200 to 350 μm long, are smooth-walled and somewhere between uncolored to pale brown. In addition, the hyphae of the mycelium are septate and hyaline. Phialides cover the upper portion of the vesicles. which are globose to sub-globose, and uniseriate, with a diameter between 15 and 30 μm. The asci contains eight spores that are typically unarranged while the perithecia are typically yellow. The mould can appear as either yellow or in patches of green.Thom, C., & Raper, K. B. (1941). The Aspergillus glaucus group (Vol. 424). US Dept. of Agriculture. == Habitat and ecology == Aspergillus glaucus has a worldwide geographic distribution because of many of the aforementioned physiological characteristics. It is one of the few fungi that can be found in Arctic environments due to the extremely low temperatures. As a result, it is a common outdoor fungus in the winter. In addition, even among its own genus, A. glaucus is capable of thriving in low moisture environments, allowing it to grow in dry areas. A. glaucus is also polytrophic, allowing it to take advantage of a large number of different food sources. As a result, it's been found to grow well on a variety of different foods, including corn, wheat, fish, butter, and eggs. It can also survive in foods such as jam and jellies, very sweet substances that most other fungi cannot grow in, because of its osmotolerance. ==Pathology== Several strains of Aspergillus glaucus may produce mycotoxins. There is at least one recorded instance of this species appearing to cause a fatal brain infection. That being said, A.glaucus is not considered to be very pathogenic as its growth is restricted by temperatures of more than 35 °C. In addition, even as a pathogen, it is not considered very dangerous as it is highly susceptible to anti-fungal treatments. It is known to be an allergen and an irritant in addition to causing pneumonitis and various forms of dermatitis. ==Applications== One of the more popular applications for A. glaucus is in the production of katsuobushi, shavings of a smoked and fermented fish that is popular in Japanese cuisine. In the final stages of preparation, a culture of A. glaucus is sprayed onto the fish, providing the necessary fermentation. There have been some health concerns due to the discovery of a mytotoxin, beta-nitropropionic acid, that the fungus produces.Frisvad, Jens C.; Thrane, Ulf; Samson, Robert A.; Pitt, John I. (2006-08-29). \\"Important Mycotoxins and the Fungi which Produce Them\\". In Ailsa Diane Hocking. Advances in Food Mycology. Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology. 571. New York: Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. p. 7. . Another possible application for A. glaucus is its use as an anti-cancer agent. The mycotoxin aspergiolide A may be able to be used as an anti-cancer agent. Finally, due to its Arctic habitat and low cardinal temperature range, A. glaucus is a potential source of enzymes capable of functioning at low temperatures, though research in this area is still relatively new. ==References== glaucus ","title":"Aspergillus glaucus"},{"id":"42062772","text":"The Italian general election of 1979 took place on 3 June 1979.

Introduced in 1951 as a replacement for the 16+ School Certificate (SC), the O-level would act as a pathway to the new, more in-depth and academically rigorous A-level (Advanced Level), in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Later the complementary and more vocational Certificate of Secondary Education (CSE) was added to broaden the subjects available and offer qualifications in non-academic subjects. The O-Level and CSE were replaced in the United Kingdom in 1988 by the GCSE and later complementary IGCSE exams. The Scottish equivalent was the O-grade (replaced, following a separate process, by the Standard Grade). An O-level branded qualification is still awarded by Cambridge International Examinations in select locations. ==Structure== O-levels were predominantly exam-based; this had advantages for students in part-time or evening education. Some commentators criticised this mainly exam- based approach as offering only partial proof of the student's overall ability in comparison with other methods (e.g., coursework-based assessment). There was no summative 'school certificate': each subject was a separate O-level in its own right. Madsen Pirie argued that the O-level was advantageous to boys because of exam-based learning. Pirie also observes that the GCSE focus on coursework has disadvantaged boys, reversing the gender gap in attainment, to the degree where in all subjects girls outperform boys, including traditionally male subjects such as sciences and physical education. ==Grading== Until 1975, candidates were awarded only a pass or fail classification. Although candidates received an approximate indication of the marks awarded, O-Level Certificates simply listed those subjects in which a pass had been awarded; subjects in which a candidate had failed were not mentioned. The independent exam boards soon offered competing numeric and alphabetic classifications, for example 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 would be a pass, while grades 7, 8 and 9 were fails from the JMB. From 1975 standardized alphabetic grades where introduced with grades A, B, C, D, and E were passes, and F and U (Unclassified) were fails.http://www.liverpool.gov.uk/Images/tcm21-94640.pdfIn particular see page 88 of the definitive UCAS document at http://www.dur.ac.uk/resources/ug.admissions/ucasinfo/ukquals07.pdf Between 1965 and 1985 grades were allocated primarily on a norm-referenced basis, assigning a fixed proportion of each cohort to each grade (A 10%, B 15%, C 25–30%, D 5–10%, E 5–10%, U 15–20%). Though some exceptions existed, both at the subject and Exam Board level, with Latin and Greek pass rates being consistently higher than other subjects, with 75.4% passing in 1976, in contrast to an average 59% pass rate across all subjects e.g. Biology 56.4%, History 57%. The pass rate and top awards by the Oxford & Cambridge board were also consistently higher than the other boards e.g. In 1976, 27% of Latin entrants gained an A, and ~17% of French, German and Music candidates, this was attributed to the O&C; board being primarily used by the Independent schools. The proportion obtaining a pass, A-D, or equivalent was initially fixed at 57% – 58%, and remained under 60% through the 1970s, though there was regional variation with Northern Ireland awarding consistently more pass grades than Wales e.g. In 1982, the pass rates were: Northern Ireland 62%, England 58% Wales 53%. In 1984 a decision was taken, by the Secondary Examinations Council, to replace the norm referencing with criteria referencing, where 16+ and 18+ grades would in future be awarded on Examiner Judgement, this change was implemented, at O-Level, in June 1986. In the final year DES statistics were available 6.8% achieved an A, and 39.8% an A-C grade. O-levels incorporate an element of negative marking, with marks deducted for incorrect answers, poor spelling, grammar or handwriting. The table below gives rough equivalences between O-Level, CSE, and GCSE grades, including later changes to GCSE grades in 1994 and the 2010s: NB The current grade 9 is HIGHER than the previous A* grade was and hence has no equivalent. For GCSE Mathematics from 1988 there was an extension paper allowing candidates to achieve 3 grades higher than an A (pass, merit, and distinction). This was stopped. ==Entrants== The 1978 Waddell Report, when comparing O-Level and CSE entrants stated: \\"the O Level examination tending to be aimed at the upper 20 per cent of the full ability range and CSE catering for the next 40 per cent.\\" This conclusion is partially supported by the statistics. After 1976, for subjects where an equivalent O-level paper existed, approximately 36% of the pupils entered for either exam sat the O-Level; the remainder (64%) sat the CSE paper. The proportion taking CSE exams increased following the raising of the minimum school-leaving age to 16, in 1973, and the subsequent fall in the proportion sitting neither exam e.g. {  + English O-Level and CSE Mathematics entrants 1976-9 - ! rowspan=\\"2\\"Year !! rowspan=\\"2\\"Pupils !! colspan=\\"3\\"Numbers of maths candidates!! colspan=\\"2\\" % Maths papers!! rowspan=\\"2\\"% Pupils entered for maths - !

Unlike CSE examinations the participating schools had a choice of syllabi and awarding body, and were not required to use a designated local board. ==Later developments== The O-level qualifications in England, Wales and Northern Ireland were replaced by the General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE), phased in by 1986 with a couple of subjects, and completed for all subjects the following year. However, the O-level brand is still used in many Commonwealth countries, such as Bangladesh, Mauritius, Sri Lanka, and Singapore, instead of or alongside the IGCSE qualifications. Some British schools also reverted to exams based on the O-levels.Clark, Laura. \\"Private schools dump GCSEs in favour of old-style O Levels\\", Daily Mail, 9 August 2006. The Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination was also benchmarked against the O-levels for comparable subjects. But it has switched to benchmark against the IGCSE. The School Certificate of Mauritius continues to use the O-level exams. O-levels continue to thrive as well respected international qualifications for students in other countries, who use them for preparation for advanced study in their own country and/or access higher education overseas.

Edward Strutt (1853-1911) was a Wesleyan missionary who worked extensively in Sri Lanka in the latter part of the 19th century. ==Background== He was born in Mansfield Woodhouse, Nottinghamshire, England in 1853 to parents George and Elizabeth (née Housley). ==Family== Strutt was the youngest of 6 children (3 boys and 3 girls). His father was a master bootmaker who had always been very involved with the Wesleyan Church and it is likely that this was the main factor which led him to become a missionary. Strett married Katharine Osborn, youngest daughter of Rev. Dr. George Osborn, who served as General Secretary of the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society for 17 years. They went on to have two sons in 1884, Arnold Unwin & Raymond Hugh (presumed twins) while posted in Colombo. ==Writing== He wrote a book entitled Memorials of Thomas Lowe of Rusholmewhich was published in 1892. His memoirs were also published posthumously by his son, Raymond in 1913. The book was entitled A Missionary Mosaic from Ceylon and appears to have been popular as a Sunday School prize. This book highlights some of the real dangers faced by missionaries at this time with him writing of severe Typhoid outbreaks in his time in Ceylon. ==Later life== In August 1890 Strutt was appointed as 2nd Minister for the Oxford Road Chapel in Rusholme, Lancashire, England. This is a post he would hold with the church until 1893. ==Death== Strutt died at the age of 58 in Newquay, Cornwall on 15 April 1911. He had returned to England in 1887 due to poor health and this is likely to have been a factor in him passing away at a relatively young age. ==References== Category:1853 births Category:1911 deaths Category:Methodist missionaries in Sri Lanka Category:British expatriates in Sri Lanka Category:People from Mansfield Woodhouse Category:English Methodist missionaries ","title":"Edward Strutt (missionary)"},{"id":"42063053","text":"Maria Cristina Cavalcanti de Albuquerque (born February 1943, in Vertentes) is a Brazilian novelist, historian and psychiatrist. == Biography == Daughter of the physician and politician Emidio Cavalcanti de Albuquerque and Maria do Carmo Santana Cavalcanti.

South Australia was the third Australian state behind Victoria and New South Wales to race speedcars when races began at the Camden Motordrome on 28 December 1935. Two years later saw the formation of the states first governing body, South Australian Speedways Limited.South Australian Speedcars - History The first State Championship was run at the Kilburn Speedway in Adelaide in 1946/47 and was won by Victorian driver Jack O'Dea.SA Speedcar Championship honor roll Adelaide based drivers Murray Hoffman, and former Speedcar and Sprintcar national champion Phil March jointly hold the record with four wins each. The now defunct Rowley Park Speedway in Adelaide hosted the championship on 29 occasions between 1959/50 and 1978/79. Speedway Park/City is next hosting on 20 occasions between 1979/80 and 1999/2000. Of the state titles held since 1946/47, there have been 6 won by overseas visitors. They have been Bob Tattersall (1958/59, 1967/68), Jimmy Davies (1962/63, 1963/64) and Mark Passerrelli (1987/88) from the United States, and New Zealand speedway star Barry Butterworth (1964/65). One family has made the SA Title record books in recent times with four members of the same family winning the event. Garry Dillon took the win in 1993/94; his son Luke Dillon driving for his Uncle Stephen Dillon won in 2006/07; son Lee Dillon won in 2008/09 driving for fellow SA Speedcar racer Mark Harrington; and cousin Ben Dillon who won the event in 2010/11 driving for his father Stephen. The reigning SA Champion is Western Australian Dayne Kingshott, until a new winner is crowned at Borderline Speedway, Mount Gambier on Friday 4 January 2019.

Frederick Smith Chemical Company, is a privately owned specialty chemical company with headquarters in Powell, Ohio and manufacturing facilities in Columbus, Ohio. It was founded by G. Frederick Smith in Urbana, Illinois in 1924, and moved to Columbus, Ohio in 1928. GFS Chemicals currently serves over seventy countries and a variety of industries, including: Alternative energy, energy storage, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, electronics, etching, and environmental and research analytics. The company has approximately 100 employees. Its various divisions are managed by three separate units: Organic Specialty Materials, Inorganic Specialty Materials, and Analytical Reagents & Research Chemicals Catalog Division. == History 1920s=== The Smith Chemical Company was started in G. Frederick Smith’s garage in Urbana, Illinois as a result of his use of magnesium perchlorate as a super drying agent. Smith enlisted the help of his brothers Allyne (who studied engineering at Ohio State) and Clarence (who worked for a local newspaper). Orders quickly outpaced their ability to fill them. In 1928 G. Frederick Smith Chemical Company moved to Columbus, Ohio on McKinley Avenue, and began to sell magnesium perchlorate under the trade name \\"Dehydrite\\" for A.H. Thomas Co., later Thomas Scientific. G. Frederick Smith Chemical Company would become one of the leading perchloric acid and perchlorate salt producers in the world. ===1930s and 1940s=== University of Illinois graduate student Charles Getz, in an attempt to store milk anaerobically to prevent spoilage, accidentally invents the world's first aerosol dispensed product, instant whipped cream. He and G.F. Smith found nitrous oxide to be the most suitable gas and started the Aerated Products Company, later known as Instantwhip. The company was later turned over to G.F. Smith’s son Clifton, although Getz would retain the patent. Smith started producing commercial quantities of 1,10-phenanthroline and its derivatives, producing a range of indicators for use in analytical chemistry. He investigated the preparation of cerium compounds for use as titrants in oxidation and reduction reactions. Aided by phenanthroline indicators, he produced hexanitratocerate as a primary standard. Studies of periodic acid, iodic acid, and their salts prompted a new line of products. In the 1940s, Rare earth products, such as ceric ammonium nitrate, and heteroaromatic ligands, are introduced to the product line. ===1960s, 70s, and 80s=== In the 1960s, the company developed and produced new high purity redistilled inorganic acids in response. In the 1960s, Allyne Smith retired and turned control of G. Frederick Smith Chemical Company over to Darrell Hutchinson, his son-in-law, to run as President and CEO. In the 70s, the company . collaborated with Motorola on the first ceric ammonium nitrate-based chrome etchants for use in early computer chips. The firm became the sole US manufacturer of perchloric acid after Hooker Occidental Petroleum) decides to abandon that field. G. Frederick Smith died in 1976. In the 80s, Instantwhip and G. Frederick Chemical Co. parted ways following a stock swap agreement between those with ownership stakes in both of the firms. ===1990s=== In the 1990s G. Frederick Smith Chemical Co. shortened its name to GFS Chemicals, Inc. and acquired Ericsen Instruments' Karl Fischer reagent business (now the Watermark brand), and several other specialty organic product lines from Farchan Laboratories and Shawnee Chemical Company. In the 90s GFS became ISO 9001:2008 Certified. A new plant was built specifically for the production of perchloric acid. In ___, J. Steel Hutchinson became President of GFS Chemicals. ===2000s=== A new organic production facility was built, allowing for the expansion of previously purchased product linesn, including liquid ammonia chemistry, silanes, acetylenes, and other organics. The company acquired APS Analytical Standards, a maker of turbidimeters, colorimeters, and spectrometers. This business was moved from California to Columbus. Distilled acids demand increased, and GFS expanded its distillation equipment. Inorganic and organic research labs were built for continued research and quality control testing. The company attained Society of Chemical Manufacturers and Affiliates (SOCMA) Chem Steward Tier I Certification. GFS partnered with Ensign-Bickford Aerospace and Defense for the manufacture of Ammonia Borane. ===2010s=== A Catalog Order Distribution Center was purchased on Kaderly Drive on the west side of Columbus; it now houses all GFS catalog fulfillment activities, private labeling and analytical laboratory reagents manufacturing. Due to import issues with China, GFS embarked on a research campaign and becomes the only domestically secured chain of supply for cerium. A new grade of ceric ammonium nitrate was introduced with tighter metals tolerances for use as an electronics-grade etchant component. The American Association for Laboratory Accreditation (A2LA) expanded accreditation to GFS for ISO/IEC 17025:2005 for turbidity, pH buffers, and conductivity standards.http://www.federalbuyersguideinc.com/press-release/10756 == Divisions of the Company  Inorganic Specialty Materials Division === Located in Columbus, OH, the Inorganic manufacturing facility is the original cornerstone of GFS Chemicals, as first used by G. Frederick Smith. === Organic Specialty Materials Division === Located on River Street Columbus, OH, the Organic manufacturing facility as a location is a relatively new facility. GFS has always performed organic chemistries, however after the acquisition period more space was needed to further develop the business and to explore the future scientific opportunities which could be advanced. These newer developments have at times crossed over with the Inorganic side with anhydrous Lithium Perchlorate in the form of Lithium Perchlorate-Diethyl Ether to promote synthetic organic chemical synthesis in bulk, as an example. They added a Kilo lab and a Distillation lab as well in the proceeding years. === Analytical Reagents and Research Chemicals Catalog Division === Located on Kaderly Drive, Columbus, OH, the newest addition to the GFS landscape is also the oldest business. G. Frederick Smith was spurred to create many of the chemical compounds, especially perchlorates and trace metal perchloric acid, in response to the needs of his colleagues in analytical chemistry. This tradition is continued here and is the most commonly associated part of the business when a chemist or researcher hears of GFS Chemicals. The trace metal acids are especially popular among researchers who are looking to digest organics for study without the risk of metal contamination. Recently the American Association of Laboratory Accreditation expanded the accreditation to meet ISO/IEC 17025:2005 for the standards and buffers produced here as well as EPA approval for the AMCO Clear® line of turbidity standards. ==References * Category:Chemical companies of the United States Category:Research support companies Category:Companies based in the Columbus, Ohio metropolitan area Category:Chemical companies established in 1924 Category:1924 establishments in Illinois Category:Privately held companies of the United States ","title":"GFS Chemicals"},{"id":"42063311","text":"The 1st Regional Community Defense Group, Army Reserve Command is a line unit of the Army Reserve Command of the Philippine Army.

Completion of Advanced Reserve Officer Training Corps is considered a graduate qualification in military science, and such graduates who subsequently progress to the Probationary Officer Training Course are commissioned as second lieutenants.Reserve Officers' Training Corps (Philippines) Other than time-in- grade and merit promotions, rank adjustments are authorized depending on civilian qualifications, as well as their reciprocity to the operating environment. ==Types of reservists== There are currently two types of reservists in the Armed Forces of the Philippines Reserve Force: * Ready Reservists: physically-fit and tactically-current reservist personnel that are always on constant alert and training; ready to mobilise once a mobilisation order has been given. * Standby Reservists: reservist personnel who do not maintain currency in specialization qualifications but the base for expansion, support and augmentation to the Ready Reserve Force as needed. ==Units== The 1st Regional Community Defense Group has several line units under its command, making the administration and training of reservists more compartmentalized and territorial based. ===Base Units=== * Headquarters and Headquarters Service Company * Reserve Officer Training Corps Training Unit * Citizens Military Training Unit * Reservist Management Information Systems Office ===Line Units=== * 101st (ILN) Community Defense Center - Camp Valentin Juan, Laoag, Ilocos Norte * 102nd (ILS) Community Defense Center - Camp Elpidio Quirino, Bulag-Bantay, Ilocos Sur * 103rd (LUN) Community Defense Center - Camp J Laberinto, Naguilian, La Union * 104th (PGN-W) Community Defense Center - Isidro Norte, Binmaley, Pangasinan * 105th (PGN-E) Community Defense Center - Camp Lt Tito B Abat, Manaoag, Pangasinan * 106th (BNT) Community Defense Center - Athletic Bowl, Baguio City * 107th (ABR) Community Defense Center - Camp Juan Villamor, Bangued, Abra * 108th (MTP) Community Defense Center - Bontoc, Mountain Province ===Reserve Divisions=== * 16th Infantry Division Ready Reserve (Cp Tito Abat, Manaoag, Pangasinan) * 17th Infantry Division Ready Reserve (Cp Eldridge, Los Baños, Laguna) * 5th Infantry (Ready Reserve) Division, PA (Cp Elpidio Quirino, Bulag, Bantay, Isabela) * 12th Infantry (Ready Reserve) Division, PA (Cp Juan Villamor, Bangued, Abra) ==Awards and DecorationsCampaign Streamers=== { - bgcolor=\\"#efefef\\" !

It was legal in the Byzantine Empire but became rare after the first half of 7th century.Aleksandr Petrovich Kazhdan et al., \\"Change in Byzantine Culture in the Eleventh and Twelfth Centuries\\", University of California Press, 1985, p. 10 From 11th century, semi-feudal relations largely replaced slavery.Clarence- Smith, \\"Islam and the Abolition of Slavery\\", 228. Under the influence of Christianity, views of slavery shifted: by the 10th century slaves were viewed as potential citizens (the slave as a subject), rather than property or chattel (the slave as an object).Youval Rotman, \\"Byzantine Slavery and the Mediterranean World\\", transl. by Jane Marie Todd, Cambridge, Massachusetts – London, Harvard University Press 2009. Book presentation in a) Nikolaos Linardos (University of Athens), , Mediterranean Chronicle 1 (2011) pp. 281, 282, b) Alice Rio, American Historical Review, Vol. 115, Issue 5, 2010, pp. 1513–1514 Slavery was also seen as \\"an evil contrary to nature, created by man's selfishness\\", although it remained legal. ==Sources of slaves== A main source of slaves were prisoners of war, of which there was a great profit to be made. The Synopsis of Histories mentions that after the Battle of Adrassos many prisoners of war were sent to Constantinople. They were so numerous that they filled all the mansions and rural regions. Most of the domestic servants in large Byzantine homes were slaves and were very numerous. Danielis of Patras, a wealthy widow in the 9th century, gave a gift of 3,000 slaves to Emperor Basil I.Marcus Louis Rautman, Daily Life in the Byzantine Empire, (Greenwood Publishing, 2006), 22. The eunuch Basil, chancellor during the reign of Basil II, was said to have owned 3,000 slaves and retainers.Trade and Industry, F.H. Marshall, Illustrated Encyclopedia of World History, Vol. 4, ed. JA Hammerton, (Mittal Publications), p. 2629. Some slaves worked the landed estates of their masters, which declined in later ages. A medieval Arab historian estimates that 200,000 women and children were taken as slaves after the Byzantine reconquest of Crete from the Muslims. Yet parents, living in the Byzantine empire, were forced to sell their children to pay their debts, which Byzantine laws unsuccessfully tried to prevent. After the 10th century the major source of slaves were often Slavs and Bulgars, which resulted from campaigns in the Balkans and lands north of the Black Sea. At the eastern shore of the Adriatic many Slav slaves were exported to other parts of Europe. Slaves were one of the main articles that Russian (often Vikings) traders dealt in their yearly visit to Constantinople. After the 12th century, the old Greek word \\"δοῦλος\\" (doulos) obtained a synonym in \\"σκλάβος\\" (sklavos), perhaps derived from the same root as \\"Slav\\". ==Social life== Slavery was mostly an urban phenomenon with most of the slaves working in households.Daily Life in the Byzantine Empire, Marcus Louis Rautman, page 22 The \\"Farmers Law\\" of the 7th/8th centuries and the 10th century \\"Book of the Prefect\\" deals with slavery. Slaves were not allowed to marry until it was legalized by emperor Alexios I Komnenos in 1095. However; they did not gain freedom if they did. The children of slaves remained slaves even if the father was their master. Many of the slaves became drafted in the army. The socio-economic status of slaves did not necessarily coincide with their legal status. Slaves of the rich had a higher standard of living than free persons who were poor. Also, the legal system made it advantageous for masters to place them in certain economic positions, such as foremen of shops. For example, a goldsmith accused for illicit trade of gold, if he was a slave, could be confiscated. If he was free, he would be whipped and pay a heavy penalty exceeding the value of a slave. Thus, masters were appointing slaves as shop foremen, where they could have authority over free laborers (misthioi, μίσθιοι).Youval Rotman, Byzantine Slavery and the Mediterranean World, Harvard University Press, 2009, pp 101, 102 ==Eunuchs== Castration was outlawed, but the law was poorly enforced, and young boys were often castrated before or after puberty. Eunuchs (castrated boys and men) were traded as slaves, both imported to and exported from the empire. The scholar Kathryn Ringrose says they \\"represented a distinct gender category, one that was defined by dress, assumed sexual behavior, work, physical appearance, quality of voice, and for some eunuchs, personal affect.\\" Eunuch servants were popular at times. Rich Byzantine families often paid high prices for these slaves, who they sometimes accepted as part of the household. Eunuchs played an important role in the Byzantine palace and court where they could rise to high posts. ==Prices== Slave markets were present in many Byzantine cities and towns.The slave market of Constantinople was found in the valley of the Lamentations. At certain times a 10-year-old child's price was 10 nomismata, a castrated one of the same age was worth 30. An adult male 20 and an adult eunuch 50 nomismata. ==Transition from slave labour to free== Yet it is probable that ordinary labour in towns was conducted on a system like that introduced by Diocletian, whereby the labourer was bound to pursue an hereditary calling, but received wages and provided his own keep. This is the system indicated in the tenth-century \\"Book of the Prefect\\". The \\"Farmer's Law\\" of the seventh and eighth centuries shows the free \\"colonus\\" working in his village, and the slave working on the large landed proprietor's estate, but both classes tended to fall into the condition of serfs tied to the soil. Thus the Byzantine Empire marks an important transitional period from slavery to free labour. Emperor Justinian (r. 527-565) undertook a major revision and codification of ancient Roman law, including law on slavery. He acknowledged that slavery is an unnatural state of human existence and not a feature of natural law. The Justinian law retained the principle that a slave is an item of property, but it does not state that a slave is devoid of personality. He removed some earlier harsh slave laws. For example, he gave to the slaves the right to plead directly and personally for their freedom, and he declared that the master killing his slave commits a murder.Tim Clarckson, in \\"The Historical Encyclopedia of World Slavery\\", ABC-CLIO (1997), article \\"Justinian, laws of\\", vol. 1, pp 386, 387 ==Famous slaves== * Samonas (eunuch) * Andrew of Constantinople (holy man) * Tzachas (soldier) * John Axouch (soldier) ==See also== *History of slavery *Arab–Byzantine prisoner exchanges ==References== Category:Byzantine society Byzantine Byzantine Byzantine ","title":"Slavery in the Byzantine Empire"},{"id":"42063322","text":"\\"Say It Ain't So, Joe\\" is a song written and performed by Murray Head.

It is noted for the innovative design of its hotel rooms, which are constructed offsite, and then installed in a hotel. The concept was created after BLOC's founders studied capsule hotels, which are commonly located in Japan. The hotel chain has properties based in Gatwick Airport and Birmingham in the United Kingdom, with plans for several additions. ==Overview and design== BLOC hotel in Birmingham The concept is inspired by Japanese capsule hotels, which focus on creating rooms for guests in small places. The construction technique was implemented by BoxBuild a UK based construction company. Their method of implementation of the hotel was to manufacture each room individually offsite, and then stack the rooms in situ so the hotel exterior could be built around them. The group's approach is to cut costs through effective usage of space while offering good design, quality and style. BLOC Hotels focuses on the sleep and shower experiences of its clients avoiding unnecessary elements, such as the wardrobe. The company's intention is to open its hotels in places where space is at a premium, and where local infrastructure and facilities are good. The company opened its first hotel in the Jewellery Quarter. of Birmingham in 2011. According to the company the hotel was planned and built in 25 weeks, with the construction of the core structure finished in just 8 days. It has 73 rooms. An extension to the hotel was opened in October 2016 consisting of 35 Apartment style hotel suites. In 2012, the group announced that it would be opening a second hotel, located at the Gatwick Airport. Rob Morgan, managing director of the BLOC Hotels, was reported to secure £7 million funding package from NatWest to start construction of the hotel. According to Morgan, the Gatwick hotel would be owned under 99-years lease from the airport. The hotel is in a renovated office block, having four floors, built above (rather than inside) the terminal. It has 245 rooms with most having external windows and opened in April 2014. Guests can control room settings from an app. In September 2016 Birmingham City Council unanimously approved plans for BLOC Grand Central a 270 ft hotel tower to be located opposite Birmingham's Grand Central Station. Construction is due to start in 2017 and will be BLOC Hotels second property in the city. ==References External links == * Official website * Category:Hotel chains in the United Kingdom ","title":"Bloc Hotels"},{"id":"42063366","text":"Geodorcus helmsi or Helms's stag beetle is a large, slow-moving, flightless stag beetle in the family Lucanidae. It is endemic to New Zealand. ==Description== Geodorcus helmsi Geodorcus helmsi varies in colour from black to brownish-black. Its dorsal surface can vary from dull to glossy. Like other stag beetles, they show sexual dimorphism: males range in size from 17.5–44.0 mm, including their large mandibles, while females are smaller (16.5–27.5 mm) with less conspicuous mandibles. In larger male specimens, the mandibles are long, slender and strongly arched with a conspicuous tooth near their base. G. helmsi is distinguished from other Geodorcus by its straight un-arched tibiae, and five setose ridges on the elytra.A male (left) and female (right) Geodorcus helmsi demonstrating sexual dimorphism Geodorcus helmsi == Distribution== Geodorcus helmsi is the most widespread of the ten Geodorcus species, having been collected from Karamea on the northern West Coast of New Zealand to the south of the South Island, as far as Tapanui in West Otago. It has also been collected from islands in Fiordland and from Stewart Island. Adults have a wide altitudinal range, from sea level to 1400 m. ==Habitat== All Geodorcus species are mainly nocturnal and hide underneath fallen log stones or leaf litter on the forest floor. At night D. helmsi have been seen active on tree trunks, chewing at the bark to get access to the exudate. This species occupies a highly variable habitat, including forest and tussock- dominated high country. ==Diet== The feeding ecology of adult G. helmsi may be highly variable: they occupy a wide range of habitats from forest to the tussock zone in the high country. Adults have been observed on tree trunks feeding on sappy exudate from wounds in the bark. Larvae of other lucanid beetles commonly eat the surface of rotting wood. Geodorcus larvae have been observed to have large quantities of humus inside their gut. ==Life cycle== In New Zealand stag beetles, there is no published information about the duration or timing of oviposition, larval, pupal and adult stages of the life cycle. Copulation has been observed in October. Larvae of Geodorcus have been seen under decaying logs, occupying a gallery in the soil layer. They are \\"C\\" shaped, slow moving, and avoid the light. ==Conservation== Geodorcus helmsi on pare All Geodorcus species are protected under Schedule 7 of The 1953 Wildlife Act, making it illegal to hunt, kill, or possess a specimen.

It was built between 1553 and 1554 to a design by Niccolò Bellavante, on the site of an earlier auberge.

This auberge was later incorporated into the Grandmaster's Palace, and a third Auberge d'Italie was built in 1579. A Church of St. Catherine was also built adjacent to the third auberge.

The site was rebuilt as housing units between 1961 and 1963, and some features of the auberge were incorporated into the new buildings. These houses are regarded as being of a sub-standard nature. Today, the only remains of the auberge are a quoin, a partially defaced coat of arms, the base of a balcony, and some mouldings on the façade.

Chu first became known for the unusual style of play he adopted during his eleven-game winning streak on Jeopardy! When the shows aired, Chu attracted criticism from many for jumping from category to category rather than selecting clues in sequential order, a strategy known as the \\"Forrest Bounce\\", after former champion Chuck Forrest. Chu prepared extensively before his Jeopardy! appearance by reviewing tapes, study guides, game theory and Jeopardy! strategy. He made his debut on January 28, 2014, winning $37,000 in his first game. After winning 11 games, he lost his 12th game (which aired on March 12, 2014) to Diana Peloquin. Chu is the seventh highest-earning Jeopardy! champion in non-tournament gameplay, with a grand total of $298,200. Chu also won an additional $100,000 for taking second place in the 2014 Tournament of Champions. Since appearing on Jeopardy!, Chu has used his fame to speak out publicly on issues that are important to him. He later became a columnist and Internet commentator, writing for The Daily Beast and Salon on various issues, including racism and sexism in nerd culture. ==Early life== Chu was born in Albany, New York, on January 30, 1984. His parents immigrated to the United States from Taiwan. He moved several times growing up, due to his father's job in the chemical industry. During his childhood, Chu lived in Cranston, Rhode Island, spent a year in Boise, Idaho, then lived in Cerritos, California, as a teenager. As a child, Chu participated in the National Geographic Bee, and while attending Swarthmore College, he was a member of the college's quiz-bowl team. He received a B.A. in History at his graduation in 2008. ==Jeopardy! appearancesPreparation=== Chu spent a great deal of time preparing in the month before his first appearance on Jeopardy! He studied tapes of former Jeopardy! contestants and created study guides based on the advice of Roger Craig. He also read about game theory and Jeopardy! strategy online. As a student at Swarthmore College, he also played quiz bowl, in which he has said he was an aggressive player despite having limited knowledge. ===Debut and championship=== Chu made his debut as a contestant on the January 28, 2014, episode of Jeopardy!, winning $37,200 in his first game. On the January 29 episode, Chu made a Final Jeopardy! wager that caused him to tie fellow contestant Carolyn Collins. Chu claimed that he made the decision to wager for a tie not out of kindness but because of the advice of 2003 College champion Keith Williams, who claims that game theory favors wagering for a tie over the more common practice of wagering to win by a dollar. Chu defeated Collins on the January 30 episode. After a three-week airtime break, he became eligible for the Tournament of Champions on February 24 when he won for the fifth time; his total winnings were $123,600. On February 26, he became the ninth biggest all-time Jeopardy! winner, with a total of $180,000. The next day, he jumped to third, with a total of $238,200. Chu won his eleventh and final game on March 11, bringing his total to $297,200. His streak ended on March 12 when he was defeated by Diana Peloquin. He ended up in third place after losing his entire score in Final Jeopardy! His third-place earnings of $1,000 brought his ultimate winnings to $298,200, putting him at third place on the list of all- time highest-earning Jeopardy! champions, behind Ken Jennings and David Madden. He also held the third-longest winning streak in the series' history, behind the same two gentlemen. Chu's 11-show winning streak was later passed by Julia Collins (20 wins in 2014), Matt Jackson (13, 2015), Seth Wilson (12, 2016), Austin Rogers (12, 2017), James Holzhauer (32, 2019), and Jason Zuffranieri (19, 2019) pushing Chu's streak to the ninth-longest in Jeopardy! history. Collins, Jackson, Rogers, Holzhauer, and Zuffranieri also surpassed Chu's total winnings, pushing Chu to eighth place in all-time regular play earnings. After his initial appearance on the show, Chu competed in the 2014 Jeopardy! Tournament of Champions, where he finished second to Ben Ingram, an IT consultant from South Carolina. Chu won $100,000 for his second-place finish, bringing his overall winnings to $398,200. ===Response to game play style=== Throughout Chu's 11-game streak, his aggressive style of play attracted criticism among fans of the series, some of whom considered his conduct to be unsportsmanlike and against the spirit of Jeopardy! His strategy earned him the nickname the \\"Jeopardy! Villain\\", a nickname Chu fully embraced. One of the most common complaints about his playing style was that he jumped from category to category, a strategy known as the \\"Forrest Bounce\\", after former champion Chuck Forrest. The Forrest Bounce is a somewhat common strategy, however, employed by several successful other champions including Brad Rutter and James Holzhauer who, like Chu, used it to increase their odds of finding Daily Doubles first. Inspired by Watson, a computer that was programmed to play Jeopardy!, Chu picked high-value clues first, because they are more likely to be Daily Doubles. In his second game, Chu wagered $5 on a Daily Double and responded \\"I don't know\\" immediately after the clue was given. Chu also held the buzzer close to the microphone, resulting in audible clicks when signaling, and upon correctly answering a question, rushed quickly to the next clue. This gamesmanship, the resulting criticism and his engagement with critics on Twitter during airings of his shows led some to declare his run akin to a \\"Moneyball\\" moment, and Chu himself \\"ruthless\\" and \\"idol-killingly pragmatic\\". In response, both Trebek and Jennings have defended Chu as a \\"good player\\" who makes the game \\"more exciting\\". In a 2018 interview, Trebek admitted that Chu's use of the Forrest Bounce could be irritating when it disrupted the flow of the game, although he also praised Chu and said, \\"as the impartial host I accept disorder.\\" ==After Jeopardy!== After his appearance on Jeopardy!, Chu contacted publicists and PR firms to ask for suggestions on how to monetize the recognition from his Jeopardy! run. However, he found the proposals unappealing and did not follow suggestions that he use the 'successful game theorist' image. Instead, he began writing a column for The Daily Beast and later for Salon. Chu has written on various aspects of nerd culture and on being Asian American. He is a vocal critic of racism and online bullying, and is known for his opposition to the Gamergate movement. A documentary feature film about Chu's life, titled Who Is Arthur Chu?, premiered at the 2017 Slamdance Film Festival. It is directed by Scott Drucker and Yu Gu. ==Personal life== alt=Chu sits foreground left in a black suit besides Blair, background right, in a blue and white floral dress. Chu resides in Broadview Heights, Ohio. Chu has worked as a voice actor, for example, on the webcomic Erfworld, and as an insurance compliance analyst.

They later divorced. ==FootnotesReferences * What's Up With Chu – Chu's blog (no longer updated) * Chu's website * * Arthur Chu at Salon * Arthur Chu at The Daily Beast Category:1984 births Category:American male bloggers Category:American bloggers Category:American people of Taiwanese descent Category:Jeopardy! contestants Category:Living people Category:Writers from Albany, New York Category:People from Boise, Idaho Category:People from Cerritos, California Category:People from Cranston, Rhode Island Category:People from Broadview Heights, Ohio Category:Swarthmore College alumni ","title":"Arthur Chu"},{"id":"42063439","text":"Canada Bandy is the governing body for bandy in Canada.

In 2004 she won the award for Best short film at Guldbaggegalan, for the animated movie Glenn, the Great Runner, for which she also received the Public choice award at Goteborg International Film Festival. == Biography == Erlandsson was born in Bromma but moved to Värmland at the age of 16, to study at a ski college. She later came to Vålådalen in Jämtland and decided to live in this area later on. Before the move to Jämtland and Rödön in 1989, Erlandsson lived in Stockholm for a few years. She studied at a preparatory art school in 1978 and continued with four years at Konstfack (1978–1982), where she also did a further education for designers in 1986. After this Erlandsson took a lot of short courses, among others at Gerlesborgskolan, Ordfront and Härke konstcentrum before she continued with an animation education at Filmpool Jämtland (1998–2000). Erlandsson has three sons, a husband and lives on a small farm with two dogs, a cat and sheep. She has a lot of interests in addition to her work and includes skiing, running and kayaking. == Career == After Erlandssons four years at Konstfack she started freelancing as an illustrator, exhibition designer and model builder. She has worked for newspapers, museums and municipalities with all kinds of materials such as mosaic and textile and has also done a lot of separate exhibitions. One example of her design is of the hydropower museum in Krångede, Jämtland. Since 1991 Erlandsson has worked as an illustrator and designer for the nature information company Naturriddarna. She is also one animator out of five of the company Tant-I-Loop Film. In 2004 she made Glenn, the Great Runner, a three minutes animation about a man, Glenn, who is running in a competition but who, through the whole race, is being helped and supported by his wife. For this film she won the award for Best short film at Guldbaggegalan and received the Public choice award at Goteborg International Film Festival. Erlandsson has said that she did the film to get the debate going on why teenage girls set aside their own interests in favor for serving their men as fast as they fall in love. This year she also made Sjuk-Huset , a two minutes animation about a day at a hospital. Erlandsson did the vignette to the 29th Goteborg International Film Festival in 2006 and the seven minutes animation Hanspår. This film is about a nature program that discusses the inexplicable behavior of a big group of individuals- the European males. She also did her first non-animated work, I lust och nöd. To the tunes of Verdi a white-dressed bride goes cross country skiing with a long veil behind her. This film stars Anna Erlandsson herself as the main character. Since this year, 2006, Erlandsson is also an honorary member of WIFT, Women in Film and Television. In 2009 Erlandsson did the four minutes, animated short film DORIS as one part out of eight for the feature film Doris the movie. Erlandssons animated short is about Doris, a cleaning woman at the Film institute. On her way to work she finds a document from the Doris manifest, which she reads and reflects up on. This leads to Doris deciding to help out with some problems that needs to be corrected. The book Svenska mjölkbönders ordlista was published in 2009 and is a wordlist of 145 out of thousands of all the Swedish words that contain the word \\"ko\\", all combined with Erlandssons illustrations. Another book that she has been a part of is the educational children's book Min vän Molle from 1995, in which Erlandsson did the illustrations and Curt Lofterud the text. Maya Westlund started working for Erlandsson in 2013. == Filmography == * 2004 – Glenn, the Great Runner * 2004 – Sjuk-Huset * 2006 – Hanspår * 2006 – I lust och nöd * 2009 – Doris == Bibliography == * 1995 – Min vän Molle * 2009 – Svenska mjölkbönders ordlista == References  External links == *Official webpage Category:1956 births Category:Living people Category:Swedish designers Category:Swedish animators Category:Swedish animated film directors Category:Swedish illustrators Category:Women animators Category:Swedish women illustrators Category:Swedish women artists Category:Guldbagge Awards ","title":"Anna Erlandsson"},{"id":"42063442","text":"Jin Shijia (; born 10 November 1986), also known as Kingscar Jin, is a Chinese actor and swimmer.

The last 1.5 km are seldom visited, ending at the cape of Havknude. Here the beach turns into a stony shoreline, that continues 30 km down the east coast of the peninsula of Djursland, facing the Kattegat between Denmark and Sweden. This coastline south of Grenaa Beach is renowned amongst anglers. ==Recreational== There are a lot of summer rentals close to the town of Grenaa and Grenaa Beach, and the beach is a recreational asset for these houses and for the inhabitants of Grenaa. Facing east away from the predominant westerly winds, and protected from the Atlantic, increases the amount of good beech days. The summer temperature in Denmark is seldom unpleasantly hot. With a band of dunes the beach has sheltered spots along the coast if its to chilly to stay on the open beach. Apart from Danes, Grenaa beach is mostly visited by Swedes, Norwegians and Germans. It is not overcrowded, as Denmark, as well as the rest of Scandinavia, is significantly less populated than the neighbouring central European countries. The uncrowded nature is also due to many other beach-alternatives on Denmarks long coastline. On the peninsula, Djursland, where Grenaa Beach lies, there are 21 other sandy beaches. In 2006 Grenaa Beach was nominated as one of the 2 best beaches in Denmark, by The Danish Tourist Board. Many Danes have a good working knowledge of English. Katholm Strandvej runs parallel to the major part of the beach, with free parking and access to the shoreline without long walks. This, and a coastline facing east, with no tide or current to speak of under normal summer conditions, makes the beach child friendly and safe. The water is tested and certified as clean and non-polluted, under the Danish \\"Blue Flag\\" system. ==Gallery== Image:Grenå Strand vinter 2.JPGOff season: All of the Danish coastline is publicly accessible by law Image:Grenå Strand vinter 1.jpgOff Season: Frosty windsurfing Image:Glatved Straand hornfisk.JPGSouth of Grenå Beach the coast is known for angling Image:Grenå Marina.jpgGrenaa Beach starts at the Marina of Grenaa Image:Grenå å igennem Grenå.jpgA river runs through Grenaa joining the sea at the Marina Image:Grenå Kirke.JPGGrenaa Church Category:Grenaa Category:Beaches of Denmark Category:Buildings and structures in Norddjurs Municipality Category:Norddjurs Municipality Category:Tourist attractions in Denmark Category:Tourist attractions in the Central Denmark Region ","title":"Grenaa Beach"},{"id":"42063579","text":"Lou Yixiao (; born 27 December 1988), also known as Loura Lou, is a Chinese actress and singer.

The qualification is offered by the Mauritius Institute of Training and Development. The pre- vocational programme includes Form I Vocational, Form II Vocational, Form III Vocational, and Form IV Vocational stages of education. ==History== Previously, students followed a pre-vocational course of education followed by the National Trade Certificate Foundation (NTC F) course led by the Mauritius Institute of Training and Development. However, this course option has been gradually phased out and replaced with a programme of study of four years of pre-vocational education followed by the NTC F course.http://ministry- education.gov.mu/English/educationsector/seceducation/prevoca/Pages/default.aspxhttp://ministry- education.gov.mu/English/Documents/Publications/Secondary%20Curriculum%20Framework.pdfhttp://ministry- education.gov.mu/English/educationsector/seceducation/prevoca/Documents/A%20Guide%20to%20PreVocational%20Educators.pdfhttp://planipolis.iiep.unesco.org/upload/Mauritius/Mauritius_Prevoc2011.pdf ==Entry requirements== Entry into the Pre-vocational Certificate programme generally requires completion of Standard 6 of primary school. It is at this stage of education that students take the examinations for the Certificate of Primary Education; students who fail to take the exams or who are unsuccessful in completing or passing the exams may then progress onto the Pre-vocational Certificate and enter into the vocational stream of education. ==Curriculum== The pre-vocational programme of study includes instruction in the following subjects: * Communication Skills ** Arts ** Kreol ** English ** French * Numeracy and Problem Solving Skills ** Mathematics ** Science ** Information and Communication Technology (ICT) * Life Skills ** Values and Citizenship Education ** Health and Physical Education * Livelihood and Trade Skills ** Design and Technology ** Home Economics ** Entrepreneurship Skills ==Progression== Students who complete the course may then progress onto the National Trade Certificate (NTC) or enter directly into employment. Advanced NTC courses have as pre-requisites lower level courses or their academic or vocational equivalents.

He was the second surviving son of Samuel Johnson's biographer James Boswell. ==Early life and career== Boswell received his early education at an academy in Soho Square and at Westminster School, and is spoken of by the elder Boswell as \\"an extraordinary boy, very much of his father\\", who destined him for the bar. Entered at Brasenose College, Oxford, in 1797, he took his B.A. degree in 1801, proceeding M.A. in 1806, and was elected a fellow on the Vinerian foundation. While a student at Brasenose he contributed notes signed \\"J. B. O.\\" to the third edition of his father's Life of Samuel Johnson, and afterwards carefully revised and corrected the text for the sixth edition (see Malone's Prefaces). Called to the bar of the Inner Temple, 24 May 1805, he was afterwards appointed a commissioner of bankrupts. ==Literary work with Edmond Malone== He was from an early age close to his father's friend Edmond Malone, whom he assisted in collecting and arranging the materials for a second edition of his The Plays and Poems of William Shakespeare, and was requested by him in his last illness to complete it, a task which he duly performed. He contributed to The Gentleman's Magazine for June 1813 a memoir of Malone, which in 1814 he reprinted for private circulation. One of the earliest members of the Roxburghe Club, he presented to it in 1816 a facsimile reprint of the poems of Richard Barnfield, and in 1817 A Roxburgh Garland, which consists of a few bacchanalian songs by seventeenth-century poets, and of which \\"L'Envoi\\", a convivial lyric in honour of the club, was composed by himself. In 1821 appeared under his editorship what is known as the third variorum Shakespeare, The Plays and Poems of William Shakespeare, with the corrections and illustrations of various commentators, comprehending a life of the poet and an enlarged history of the stage, by the late Edmond Malone, with a new glossarial index, 21 vols. Boswell contributed a long preliminary \\"advertisement\\", various readings and notes of no great importance, with the completion of Malone's \\"Essay on the Phraseology and Metre of Shakespeare\\" and the Glossarial Index. The collection of old English literature which Malone left Boswell to be used in the preparation of this edition was presented to the Bodleian Library by Malone's brother after Boswell's death. ==Death== Boswell died suddenly at his chambers in the Temple, unmarried and apparently in embarrassed circumstances, on 24 February 1822, a few weeks before the death, in a duel, of his brother Sir Alexander, who in a poetical tribute to his memory said of him that he had \\"never lost one friend or found one foe\\". John Gibson Lockhart, in his Life of Scott,Lockhart's Life of Scott, edition of 1845, p. 477, note, cited in DNB describes Boswell as \\"a man of considerable learning, and of admirable social qualities\\", to whom, as to his brother Sir Alexander, Scott was \\"warmly attached\\". He belonged to the Albemarle Street circle of John Murray, who thought Boswell's favourable opinion of the first series of Scott's Tales of My Landlord \\"worth quoting to Scott, with those of Hallam and Hookham Frere\\".Lockhart's Life of Scott, p. 338, cited in DNB ==ReferencesBibliography=== Category:1778 births Category:1822 deaths Category:Alumni of Brasenose College, Oxford Category:Clan Boswell ","title":"James Boswell (1778–1822)"},{"id":"42063712","text":"Hassan Mohamed Hussein \\"Muungaab\\" ) is a Somali politician.

Hussein previously served as a chairman in the Somali Armed Forces' military court. ==Mayor of MogadishuAppointment=== On 27 February 2014, Hussein was appointed Mayor of Mogadishu and Governor of the Banaadir region by presidential decree. Part of an effort to firm up on municipal security, the appointment came after consultations between President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, Prime Minister Abdiweli Sheikh Ahmed and Interior Minister Abdullahi Godah Barre. Hussein replaced Mohamed Nur (Tarsan) in the mayorship. ===New mayoral office=== In March 2014, Hussein opened a new mayoral office in the capital. The headquarters were relocated to an area in north Mogadishu. ===Municipal reforms=== Mayor of Mogadishu Hassan Mohamed Hussein at a political rally in 2014. Since taking office, Hussein has made a number of reforms aimed at strengthening Mogadishu's district administrations. In early March 2014, he met with the Banaadir region's 17 District Commissioners to discuss general safety and tidiness. The gathering concluded with a pledge to ensure that there is security guidance as well as public services in place in each of the municipality's districts. The Benadir Regional Administration concurrently conducted operations in the city, including distributing national identity cards. In April 2014, Hussein announced that his administration would reopen roads in the capital that had been barricaded. Non-governmental and inter- governmental agencies as well as foreign embassies had set up the roadblocks on certain narrow streets around their compounds for safety reasons. According to Hussein, the decision to remove the barricades was in response to demands by pedestrians and drivers to permit again access to the roads, and was facilitated by improvements in local security. ===District Commissioners=== In July 2014, Hussein co-chaired a skills-training seminar in Mogadishu for all of the Banaadir region's District Commissioners. The workshop was the first of its kind since the mayor took office, and was launched in conjunction with the Ministry of Interior and Federalism. It focused on teaching good governance techniques to the young municipal officials, including public finance management, rule of law, security, and tax collection skills to finance public projects. Hussein's administration had appointed the District Commissioners through a new selection process centered on the officials' respective professional background and educational qualifications. ===2016 municipal elections=== In July 2014, Hussein announced that municipal elections are slated to be held in 2016 to determine his successor as Mayor of Mogadishu. The scheduled ballot is the first of its kind in many years, and will also see new District Commissioners voted into office. ===Assassination attempt=== On 27 July 2014, Hussein survived a landmine explosion targeting a convoy he was traveling in near the Lafweyn hotel in Mogadishu's Huriwa district. An elderly male pedestrian was later confirmed dead, and a woman was also wounded during the blast. According to Benadir region spokesman Ali Farah, Hussein was unharmed and was subsequently escorted to his office nearby. ===Import regulation=== In August 2014, Hussein's office announced strict new regulations to control the importation of medication and foodstuffs by aid agencies operating in Mogadishu. The tightened restrictions include meting out large fines and other punitive measures against agencies that are found warehousing expired items. The municipal authorities also indicated that they would begin supervising warehouses and general storage facilities operated by international agencies, including the UN. ===Government centers renovation=== In September 2014, Hussein announced that the Benadir administration would renovate important government centers in Mogadishu. He indicated that the municipal authorities would prioritize rehabilitation of state buildings and structures that had incurred damage during the civil war. The initiative is aimed at strengthening service delivery, with the Mayor calling on the business community and residents to support the renovations. To this end, Hussein was overseeing the rehabilitation of the capital's former Fisho Guverno compound. The Benadir administration also opened the Ansaloti center in the Hamar Jajab district, one of several key local markets. ===Poland security support=== In October 2014, Hussein held a closed door meeting in Mogadishu with delegates from a Poland-based security organization. The officials discussed various municipal matters, including reconstruction, development, social service delivery and security initiatives in the capital. According to Benadir administration spokesman Ali Mohamud Seko, the Polish firm pledged to support the city authorities' efforts at strengthening safety. To this end, the company will install satellite surveillance facilities in Mogadishu to monitor local security. ===Benadir-UN bilateral cooperation=== In November 2014, Mayor Hussein met with UN Special Representative for Somalia Nicholas Kay in Mogadishu. The two officials discussed a number of bilateral issues, including strengthening municipal security, training local government forces, and engaging the indigent. Hussein also indicated that he and Kay agreed to accelerate ties between the Benadir administration and the UN. Additionally, Kay applauded Hussein for pledging to hold fair city elections. ===TIKA development projects=== In December 2014, Hussein met with Turkish International Cooperation and Development Agency (TIKA) officials in Ankara to discuss development initiatives that the Turkish company is implementing in Somalia. The focus of the gathering was on accelerating the completion of these projects, particularly the construction of the Wadnaha thoroughfare that connects a number of Mogadishu's districts. Additionally, Hussein urged the firm to continue the development activities that it had already begun, and commended it for its existing work in support of the Somali government and general public. TIKA Deputy Chairman Ali Maskan in turn pledged that his company would complete the various projects in a timely manner. ===District development projects=== In December 2014, Hussein opened a new police station in the Benadir region's Shibis district. According to the Governor, the facility would strengthen the administration's presence in the area and thus improve local security. He added that construction of the station was overseen by the Benadir regional administration, with funding provided by the United States Agency for International Development. Hussein also indicated that the facility is fully equipped, and includes a commander's office, two cells, toilets, and telecommunications equipment, among other typical amenities. Additionally, the governor noted that the police station was one of several developments completed during district commissioner Abdifatah Noor Ali's eight months in office, which also include new tarmac roads and four administration departments. Hussein likewise announced that his administration was slated to open new health centers providing free medical expertise, schooling and other social services to residents in the broader Benadir region. In January 2015, Hussein led a ribbon cutting ceremony for the launch of several new development projects in the capital's Abdulaziz district. The initiatives include a new road and health center, which aim to improve the area's aesthetic appeal and social service delivery. District Commissioner Omsan Muhiadin Ali Arif also took part in the launch event, and commended Hussein for implementing the development projects. Governor Hussein in turn indicated that the initiatives are part of his administration's broader urbanization campaign. Additionally, he launched the installation of 333 new solar lights in the city's Industrial Street. In February 2015, Governor Hussein also launched two new paved roads between Hawlwadaag Interjection and Bar Ubah as well as Adan Adde Interjection and Arwo Idko in the capital's Bakara Market. The roads are each one kilometer in length, and their construction was funded by the Somali Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The initiative is part of a broader campaign by Hussein to build all of Mogadishu's roads through a public-private financing paradigm. In March 2015, Mayor Hussein officially inaugurated another new tarmac road in Bakara Market. The street's construction was financed by the Mogadishu municipality and local business community, and is also one kilometer in length. ===Municipal beautification=== In January 2015, Governor Hussein took part in a conference on city beautification and cleanliness in the Benadir region's Deyniile district. The attendees included other Benadir administration representatives, the director of national media Abdirahman Sheikh Yussuf Aladaala, and Benadir district commissioners. The officials touched on municipal sanitation, and ways in which the Mogadishu government and residents could spruce up the capital ahead of various international conferences that are slated to be held there. Hussein subsequently announced that his administration would take on most of the scheduled development initiatives in the district. The Deyniile district commissioner in turn pledged to cooperate with the other district authorities to firm up on essential services in the city. As part of its municipal beautification campaign, the Benadir administration concurrently razed illicit kiosks from the sidewalks between Makka Al-Mukarama's Jubba and Dabka junctions. The cleanup project aims to improve the city's overall facade and bring back some of its old charm. The Benadir authorities also organized a sanitation campaign contest for all of the capital's 16 districts, with Governor Mungab naming Hamarjajab district the cleanest. ===Benadir administration decrees=== In April 2015, Hussein's Benadir administration issued a number of decrees aimed at strengthening adherence to municipal regulations. According to Benadir Deputy Governor Mohamed Ahmed Diriye, street car washes in the Banaadir area would thereafter be disallowed, as they constitute a public nuisance. Individuals who vandalize streetlights, pavements and other public property were also issued a warning. Additionally, littering on roads was prohibited, as was the erection of roadblocks by hotel owners. ===Left the Office=== In October 2015 Somalia President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud Decided to Replace Mr Muungaab. Youssef Hussein Jim'ale. ( Secretary of the PD Party.

It is sometimes classified as a subspecies of Tulipa biflora and was also considered a synonym for T. buhseana Boiss.B. Gilliat-Smith/W. B. Turrill, On the Flora of the Nearer East: IX.

Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/4111523 == Description == Tulipa polychroma is a perennial bulbous plant that grows between 6 and 17 cm tall. The bulb is small and has a leathery tunic, with woolly hairs on the inside, which are normally visible at the upper end of the bulb. Bulb of Tulipa polychroma It has one to two straplike deeply channelled dark green leaves that are longer than the stem. Normally only a single flower appears, but sometimes double flowers are found as well. The bud is upright, the six tepals are between 3,0 to 4,5 cm long. The outer tepals are between 0.3 and 1.5 cm wide, the inner tepals are wider, up to 2.5 cm. The tepals are oval or slightly pointed. The cup-shaped flowers are pure white, with a bright yellow centre that takes up about a third of the flower. The outside of the outer tepals is light grey-green, the back of the inner tepals are very faintly striped down the middle in bluish green. The tips of both inner and outer tepals can have a reddish tinge. Filaments and anthers are yellow. It flowers in late February, in England it is normally the first of the species tulips to flower.the description is based on Richard Wilford, Tulips, Species and hybrids for the Gardener (Portland, Timber Press 2006), Anna Pavord, The Tulip (London, Bloomsbury 1999) and Eckehardt J. Jäger, Friedrich Ebel, Peter Hanelt, Gerd K. Müller (eds.), Rothmaler Exkursionsflora von Deutschland. Band 5: Krautige Zier- und Nutzpflanzen (Spektrum Akademischer Verlag, Berlin Heidelberg 2008) ==Identification== The plant is very similar to Tulipa biflora, which has a wider distribution, but is also found in the area where Tulipa polychroma grows. The latter has single flowers, wider inner tepals and a more leathery tunic, but the differentiation is difficult and many botanists put the plant into the Tulipa biflora species. In the bulb trade, the bigger forms of Tulipa biflora tend to be sold as Tulipa polychroma.Richard Wilford, Tulips, Species and hybrids for the Gardener (Portland, Timber Press 2006) 86 == Distribution == Tulipa polychroma grows in the Eastern Caucasus, in Transcaucasia, in Northern Iran, in Northwestern Afghanistan and Baluchistan in clayey and stony soils of the Artemisia-steppes, semi-deserts and mountain plateaus up to 3000m ASL.Anna Pavord, The Tulip (London, Bloomsbury 1999) 324 In Afghanistan, it grows in the Pistacia atlantica ecotope.Helmut Freitag, Die natürliche Vegetation Afghanistans: Beiträge zur Flora und Vegetation Afghanistans I.

It has been in cultivation since 1894. Wilford comments: \\"The small-flowered forms of Tulipa polychroma can be disappointing, their tiny blooms looking a little insipid alongside more colourfull spring bulbs.\\".Richard Wilford, Tulips, Species and hybrids for the Gardener (Portland, Timber Press 2006) 86 The plants need a fertile, highly permeable soil (lightly acid to alkaline) and a sheltered sunny spot, otherwise their stems will become spindly and etiolated and the flowers can fall over. They should be planted 10–12 cm deep and the same distance apart.Anna Pavord, Bulb, London, Mitchell Beazley 2009, 454 They naturalise easily and tend to form clumps. The flowers only open in sunshine and emit a fairly strong fruity smell. The plant was first described by the Austrian botanist Otto Stapf in 1885.Denkschrift der Mathematisch- Naturwaturwissenschaftliche Classe der Kaiserlichen Akademie der Wissenschaften Wien 1, 18 (1885) The locus typicus is Mt Karagan near Shurab in Iran.W.

As of 2013/14, the championship has not been held in either New South Wales or Queensland. The championship is generally run at country tracks and only twice (1992 and 2012) has it been held in a state capital city, that being the Northline Speedway in Darwin. The first championship was run at the Permier Speedway in Warrnambool, Victoria and was won by Waikerie based South Australian driver Neil Hoffman. The 2014/15 championship was held at the Kalgoorlie International Speedway in Kalgoorlie, Western Australia on 28 February and 1 March. South Australia's Anthony Beare won his 2nd national championship leading home former three time national champion Brad McClure of Victoria with another Victorian Mick Dann finishing third.

The cemetery occupies an area of 376,975 m². An additional Italian war cemetery was created there in 1953. A number of notable people of Berlin are buried at the cemetery; some have a grave of honor (). In particular, all of Berlin's deceased post-war mayors are buried here. == Landscape and buildings == The northern part of the cemetery was built between 1945 and 1947 by Herta Hammerbacher, and expanded from 1948 to 1954 by Max Dietrich. About a third of the area was forest, which was already 50 years old and was intentionally kept. The trees are mostly firs, with a few oaks, mountain-ashes and birches. Two straight paths in north-south direction structure the cemetery, connected by curved paths. The funeral halls are situated on a natural hill. Between the entrance and the halls is a large U-shaped meadow which was originally designed as heath. The graves are arranged in rows, both in the meadow part as in the forest part. A war cemetery was created in 1953 for 1,183 Italian POWs, many of them unidentified, who died or were killed near Berlin. It is lined by trees and bushes and thus separated from the rest of the cemetery. The grave plates are arranged in a regular pattern. Two halls, called Feierhallen (celebration halls) or Kapelle (chapel), on a hill were built from 1956 to 1958 by and . A larger and a smaller hall are connected by smaller administrative buildings. In front of the halls, two high walls covered with travertine symbolize the transition from life to death. The halls are reinforced concrete structures, with fronts of glass open to nature. Architect Ruegenberg, a student of Hans Scharoun, built simple rectangular elements on the walls and ceiling, based on a square module, and achieved \\"zurückhaltende Feierlichkeit\\" (reticent solemnity). An entrance gate at the Potsdamer Chaussee was built in 1950 by Friedrich Dückerstieg, and a gate at Wasgensteig in 1959 by Hans-Joachim Sachse and Bernhard Busen. A bell tower on the meadow was created in 1973 by Ruegenberg and Möllendorff. == Notable people == Tatjana Gsovsky Otfrid von Hanstein & Paula von Hanstein Hildegard Knef Erwin Piscator Ernst Reuter Ernst Ruska & Helmut Ruska Ulrich Schamoni Many Berlin celebrities are buried on the Waldfriedhof Zehlendorf. 43 (as of 2002) have an Ehrengrab, cared for by the Berlin Senate (marked by * in the following list), including Willy Brandt, Mayor of Berlin and Bundeskanzler, and ballet dancer and choreographer Tatjana Gsovsky. * Hans Beirer (1911–1993), Kammersänger * Gerhard Bienert (1898–1986), actor * Günther Birkenfeld (1901–1966), writer * Boris Blacher* (1903–1975), composer * Peter Bloch (1900–1984), politician * Peter Bloch jr.

In 1889 Shackle won the singles title of the Kent Championships in Beckenham, defeating May Jacks in the final in straight sets. The next year, 1890, fortunes were reversed when Jacks beat Shackle in the final in three sets. In 1891 and 1892 it was again Shackle who won the title by defeating Jacks in the final, both times in three sets. Shackles's fourth and final title at Beckenham came in 1893 when she won in straight sets against Ruth Legh. Jacks and Shackle also met in the final of the 1891 women's singles events at the British Covered Court Championships. In 1890 Jacks had won the first edition of the women's singles event, played on wood courts at the Queen's Club in London, with the loss of only one game in the final. The following year, 1891, Shackle won the final against Jacks in straight sets. Shackle successfully defended her title in 1892 and 1893 against May Arbuthnot, each time in three sets. Between 1886 and 1895 Shackle participated in five editions of the singles event at the Wimbledon Championships and achieved her best result in 1892 and 1893 when she reached the final of the all-comer's tournament. During both these years only seven women took part in the singles event and both times Shackle lost the all-comers' final in straight sets to Blanche Bingley, who on both occasions would lose the challenge round to Lottie Dod. She did not compete in the doubles or mixed doubles events at Wimbledon. In 1894 Shackle was unable to defend her titles due to a family death. Shackle was a baseline player and her game was based on accuracy and steadiness. She was the first known ambidextrous tennis player. In addition to lawn tennis she also competed in table tennis. ==References== Category:British female tennis players Category:1870 births Category:1962 deaths Category:People from Hayes, Hillingdon Category:English female tennis players Category:Tennis people from Greater London ","title":"Maud Shackle"},{"id":"42063996","text":"The Terminology Coordination Unit (TermCoord) is a supporting unit to the translation units of the Directorate-General for Translation (DG TRAD) of the European Parliament. TermCoord was created in 2008 to stimulate and coordinate the terminology work of the 24 translation units of the European Parliament in Luxembourg. It provides the terminologists and translators with tools, resources, support and training to facilitate their daily translation tasks. TermCoord also works to increase the European Parliament's inter-institutional contribution to the EU terminology database IATE.\\"TERMNET MEMBERS\\". Retrieved on 21 February 2014. == Background and history == Today's European Union legislation is drafted in 24 official languages, with each language version considered authentic. Thus, translation is an integral part in the process of drafting and adopting legal acts. The European Institutions employ many hundreds of translators to cover the major part of these translation needs and the 552 possible language combinations. The translation system must be regularly brought into line with constantly evolving legislative procedures and technology. For this reason, the importance of terminology has become increasingly clear. Back when the European Parliament worked with less than ten official languages a Terminology Division was created with the aim of collecting glossaries and other terminology material. Later on, this division was combined with the IT service, resulting in the creation of the Euterpe database (European Terminology for the European Parliament). Alongside the development of inter-institutional translation memory systems (internal Euramis), previously separate resources such as the Commission's Eurodicautom and Parliament's Euterpe, were merged into the common inter-institutional terminology database IATE (InterActive Terminology for Europe), which has been used by the EU's translation services since summer 2004. IATE was made available to the general public in June 2007. Today the database contains roughly 8.7 million terms and on its public version it receives on average 5000 queries per hour from all over the world. In 2008, Parliament decided to set up a service to coordinate all issues related to the IATE database and the terminology work carried out in the translation units. At the start, the service was staffed by three permanent officials. The officials recruited later on to the unit through internal competitions have been assigned specific tasks. The permanent staff, currently numbering ten officials, is assisted by both graduate and undergraduate trainees, who contribute to the achievements of the unit by using their specialised knowledge and skills during a traineeship period of 1–6 months.\\"TermCoord and European Institutions: Traineeship Opportunity\\". Retrieved on 21 February 2014. Terminology coordination involves constant cooperation with a network of about 100 terminologists responsible for terminology matters in their translation units and carrying out terminology assignments set by TermCoord; volunteer groups working on certain projects; and rotating terminologists seconded to the unit for three months. The rotating terminologists’ main responsibilities include participating in TermCoord's work on IATE, in particular doing updates in their native language, and liaising with the translation units to identify best practices. == Interinstitutional cooperation== The IATE database receives support and funding from the three legislative institutions (European Commission, Council of the European Union and European Parliament), the European Economic and Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions, the Court of Auditors and the Translation Centre for the Bodies of the European Union. The European Court of Justice, the European Investment Bank and the European Central Bank are also involved in providing specialised terminology, which is in some cases compiled in cooperation with national authorities. Finally, the contribution of all EU agencies, coordinated by the Translation Centre, is extremely valuable. The IATE database is managed by an inter- institutional team chaired in turn by one of the institutions which contribute to IATE and its funding. It is currently chaired by the Translation Centre, which houses the team responsible for the technical maintenance and improvement of the database. TermCoord represents DG TRAD and the European Parliament in the IATE Management Group. The latter puts in place task forces and working groups in order to constantly improve the content, interface and functions of IATE. == Proactive terminology and documentation == In 2011, in collaboration with the Development and Application Service, TermCoord introduced the \\"Glossary Links\\" tool to enable users to search in its collection of glossaries by keyword, languages, source or category.From words to the deeds. \\"More than 100 new monolingual, bilingual & multilingual glossaries\\". Retrieved on 21 February 2014. The database currently contains links to about 1800 multilingual, bilingual and monolingual glossaries and dictionaries publicly available online. The glossaries are categorised according to the various domains featured in parliamentary texts. Another helpful resource is the DocHound page – a one-stop reference page with links to various document types used in EU institutions or their respective search pages, where translators can find all kinds of reference documents they might need for their translations. == Terminology projects == As of July 2010, participating in a terminology project has become an integral part of translation traineeships in order to give trainees the opportunity to develop their terminology skills. All trainees work either on one of the ongoing thematic projects prepared and coordinated by TermCoord staff and trainees, or on a language-specific project run by the translation unit. Trainees are helped by their unit's terminologists who revise and validate their results, which are then inserted into IATE. The terminology projects encompass a wide range of topics which are constantly being adapted depending on current needs. So far, projects were carried out in areas such as human rights (the EP is responsible for this thematic area in IATE), financial markets, EP's Rules of Procedure, LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender) basic terms, IT terminology and term mining with the help of extraction tools. == Seminars == TermCoord organises terminology-related seminars for translators, terminologists and interpreters from all EU institutions, under the comprehensive title ‘Terminology in the Changing World of Translation’.\\"TermCoord events\\".

Proneural genes have multiple functions in neural development. They integrate positional information and contribute to the specification of progenitor-cell identity. From the same ectodermal cell types, neural or epidermal cells can develop based on interactions between proneural and neurogenic genes. Neurogenic genes are so called because loss of function mutants show an increase number of developed neural precursors. On the other hand, proneural genes mutants fail to develop neural precursor cells. The proneural genes are expressed in groups of cells (proneural clusters) from which one progenitor cell – typically the one in the middle – will be singled out, leading to the formation of many different types of neurons in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Proneural genes encode a group of bHLH proteins that play crucial roles in controlling cell fate in a variety of tissue types. Basic helix-loop-helix proteins are characterized by two alpha helixes separated by a loop. The helixes mediate dimerization, and the adjacent basic region is required for DNA binding. The human genome contains approximately 125 bHLH factors. ==Discovery== The proneural genes were first identified in the 1920s , when mutant flies that lacked subsets of external sense organs or bristles were found. Later on, in the 1970s, the achaete-scute complex, a complex of genes that are involved in regulating the early steps of neural development in Drosophila, were identified . Using molecular tools it was possible to isolate the first four genes of this complex: achaete (ac), scute (sc), lethal of scute (lsc) and asense (ase). Another proneural gene, atonal (ato) was isolated more recently and two ato- related genes, amos and cato, were later-isolated, defining a second family of proneural genes – atonal complex. Recently , the first homologue of the fly proneural genes to be found in mammals was mash1. ==List of proneural genes== This list refers to bHLH proteins found in invertebrates and vertebrates. They are grouped in distinct families on the basis of closer sequence similarities in the bHLH domain: {  border=\\"1\\" - ! Organisms !

Because heterodimerization is a prerequisite for DNA binding, factors that interfere with dimerization effectively act as passive repressors of proneural gene activity. Proneural proteins specifically bind DNA sequences that contain a core hexanucleotide motif, CANNTG, known as an E-box. The basic region and helix 1 of the bHLH domain form a long alpha-helix that is connected with the loop region to helix 2. Direct contacts between bHLH residues and DNA are responsible for the common ability of neural bHLH proteins to bind to the core E-boxsequence. The cells within a cluster that express a proneural gene (called a proneural cluster) can be thought of as cells of an equivalence group. Within a proneural cluster, the cells compete with each other, such that only a subset of cells is singled out to develop into neuronal precursors. This singling out process is mediated by cell-cell interactions interpreted through the action of neurogenic genes. In neuroectoderm, neurogenic genes are required to single out cells from within proneural clusters to form neuronal precursors, leaving the remaining cells of proneural clusters to develop into epidermal cells. Proneural genes may function in analogous fashions in vertebrates and invertebrates, specifically they were implicated in early neurogenesis. Although proneural proteins are responsible for trigger neurogenesis, different proteins are required for different neural and/or glial cell types. This implies that each of these proteins is capable of regulating both common target genes for neurogenesis and unique target genes for neuronal subtype characteristics. Proneural bHLH transcription factors, not only drive neurogenesis by activating the expression of a cascade of neuronal genes, but they inhibit the expression of glial genes. Neural bHLH genes have different functions depending on: the sensitivity to lateral inhibition, which determines if a cell becomes epidermal or neuronal, and whether the gene is expressed in the CNS before or after the terminal mitosis. Proneural genes promote neurogenesis and inhibit gliogenesis but some neurogenic factors can regulate both of these processes, depending on the proneural genes concentration. For example, BMPs (Bone Morphogenetic Proteins) promote neurogenesis in progenitors that express high levels of Neurogenin-1 and gliogenesis in progenitors that express low levels of Neurogenin-1. Gliogenesis processes depend on low concentrations or delection of proneural genes and can be accelerated depending on which proneural genes are affected. In invertebrates In Drosophila, proneural genes are first expressed in quiescent ectodermal cells that have both epidermal and neuronal potential. Proneural activity results in the selection of progenitors that are committed to a neural fate but remain multipotent, with sense organ progenitors giving rise to neurons, glia and other non-neuronal cell types. Additionally, some neuroblasts of the central nervous system also generate both neurons and glia. Progenitors of the peripheral and central nervous system only begin to divide after proneural gene expression has subsided. In vertebrates Proneural genes are first expressed in neuroepithelial cells that are already specified for a neural fate and are self-renewing. Proneural activity results in the generation and delamination of progenitors that are restricted to the neuronal fate and have a limited mitotic potential. In some lineages, at least, proneural genes are involved in the commitment of neural progenitors to the neuronal fate at the expense of a glial fate. In lateral inhibition process Lateral inhibition process -The expression of proneural genes in a neural progenitor leads to gliogenesis, neurogenesis and cell-cycle arrest. Besides this, it also promotes the expression of Delta that binds to the Notch receptor of a neighbour cell, repressing the proneural genes. In this way, it is generated a salt-and-pepper pattern of expression, with a central neural cell, surrounded by epidermal cells. Lateral inhibition is a cell-cell interaction that occurs within a proneural cluster to determine and limit the cells that give rise to neuroblast. During this interaction, nascent neuroblasts express proneural genes above a determined threshold and, at the same time, they express a membrane bound ligand, called ‘’Delta’’, which binds and activate Notch receptors expressed in neighboring cells. Once Notch is activated, the activity of proneural genes decreases in these cells, probably due to the activation of genes in the ‘’enhancer of split E(spl)’’ complex, encoding in inhibitory bHLH transcription factors. When inhibited, proneural genes prevent cells from becoming neural, but also reduce their levels of ‘’Delta’’. These particular interactions restrict the proneural activity to a single cell in each proneural cluster giving rise to a salt-and-pepper pattern. Not all proneural genes are equally sensitive to lateral inhibition. For example, in Xenopus, Chitnis and Kintner demonstrated that ‘’XASH-3’’ and NeuroD (achaete- scute complex) respond differently to lateral inhibition, which reflect different ability to activate target genes and differential susceptibility of these target genes to repression by notch. Posterior studies revealed that even when Notch/Delta signaling pathway is blocked, Wnt2b is capable of inhibiting neuronal differentiation, through the downregulation of mRNA expression of multiple proneural genes and also of Notch1. With this mechanism Wnt2b maintains progenitor cells undifferentiated by attenuating the expression of proneural and neurogenic genes, preventing cells from getting into the differentiation cascade regulated by proneural genes and Notch. Although notch signaling is involved in the control of proneural gene expression, positive-feedback loops are required to increase or maintain the levels of proneural genes. The transcription factors responsible for this maintenance can act through the inhibition of the notch signaling pathway in particular cells or at a post-transcriptional level, affecting proneural genes transcription and function. In neurogenesis =Neurogenesis in the invertebrate nervous system= In invertebrates, the proneural genes, particularly the members of the achaete-scute complex(AS-C) promote neurogenesis, while the neurogenic genes prevent neurogenesis and facilitate epidermal development. The formation of neuroblasts depends on the Achaete- scute complex genes – achaete (ac), scute (sc), lethal of scute (lsc) and ventral nervous system defective (‘’vnd’’). However, only ‘’vnd’’ can control this formation process because this gene activates the expression of the others. ac, sc, lsc factors are initially expressed within the primordium of the embryonic central nervous system (neuroectoderm) in proneural clusters, from which single neuroblasts later arise. Every cell of the proneural cluster shares a common neuroblasts-forming potential. The local inhibition of the remaining cells by the enlarging neuroblasts ensures that only one neuroblast arises from the proneural cluster. All cells of the cluster retain their NB forming potential, at least while the NB is enlarging, but lose this potential by the time the cell is about to divide. The patterns of expression of the proneural genes lead to different modes of neuroblasts formation in the head and trunk. Co-expression of proneural genes in brain neuroblasts is transient and varies with the developmental stage. =Neurogenesis of the stomatogastric nervous system in Drosophila= Proneural gene expression in the neuroectodermal cells that constitutes the proneural clusters turns them competent to delaminate as neuroblasts. Although neuroblasts are the precursors of Drosophila’s central nervous system (CNS), the proneural gene expression are also involved in control specification and morphogenesis of stomatogastric nerve cell precursors. These genes are expressed and required during all phases of the stomatogastric nervous system (SNS) development to regulate the number, pattern and structural characteristics of the SNS subpopulations. The proper balance between proneural and neurogenic gene expression in the SNS placodes is involved in the control of a complex sequence of morphogenetic movements (delamination, invagination and dissociation) by which these placodes give rise to the different SNS subpopulations. =Neurogenesis in the vertebrate central nervous system= In central nervous system not all bHLH genes are involved in neurogenesis because NeuroD and ‘’Math3/NeuroM’’ families are also involved in the neuronal-versus-glial cell fate decision. Another pro-neural family (which includes ‘’math1’’ and ‘’math5’’) is essential to the development of a small number of neural lineages whereas ‘’math1’’ have also a role in the specification interneuron identity. Cell types that depend on ‘’math1’’ expression belong to the proprioceptive sensory pathway. Bertrand et al. (2002) have confirmed the proneural activity of ‘’mash1’’, ngn1 and ngn2, and possibly math1 and ‘’math5’’ in the mouse. Neurogenesis in the central nervous system depends on proneural gene inhibition by Notch signaling pathway and the absence of this key regulator results in the premature differentiation of neurons. To maintain neural progenitor cells a regulatory loop takes place between neighboring cells, that involves the lateral inhibition process (see lateral inhibition). In the absence of Lateral inhibition some proneural genes such as ASCL1 or ‘’neuroG’’ are capable of inducing the expression of neuron- specific genes leading to the premature formation of early born-neurons. Ratié and colleagues (2013) comprised that Notch proneural gene network have an important role in cell fate renewal and transition in the mouse. =Neurogenesis in the vertebrate peripheral nervous system= In the peripheral nervous system, Ngns are involved in the determination of all cranial and spinal sensory progenitors. Proneural genes such as mash1, ngn1 and ngn2 are mainly expressed in most progenitors of spinal cord, and are also co-express in the dorsal telencephalon. Together these groups of bHLH factors promote the generation of all cerebral cortex progenitors. Mash1 is the only gene expressed in the ventral telencephalon. However, in the ventral and dorsal ends of the neural tube a different type of proneural genes is expressed, such as ngn3 and ‘’math1’’. In gliogenesis Proneural genes in neurogenesis and gliogenesis pathway - Neural stem cells have the potential to generate all neural cell types, such as neuron (neuronal progenitor), astrocytes and oligodendrocytes (glial progenitors). The proneural gene expression is induced by neurogenic signals and results in the activation of neuronal-differentiation pathway . At the same time, glial differentiation is inhibited. Neural stem cells lead to neuron differentiation while proneural genes inhibit glyogenic signals and consequently the glial-differentiation pathway. Neural stem cells could give rise to neuronal or glial progenitors, depending on the type of signals that they receive - gliogenic or neurogenic signals, respectively. Glial progenitor cells could differentiate into oligodendrocytes or astrocytes. However, lineage commitment of neural progenitors involves the suppression of alternative fates. Therefore, vertebrate proneural genes promote neuronal fates and simultaneously inhibit glial fates. For example, the downregulation of the expression of proneural gene ngn2 in the spinal cord represses oligodendrocyte differentiation. In the context of restricted glial progenitors, proneural genes might have functions that are distinct from their better-characterized role in lineage specification, perhaps in the differentiation of glial lineages. Sun and colleagues showed that proneural ngn1 inhibits gliogenesis by binding transcriptional co-activators like CBP/Smad1 or p300/Smad1 preventing the transcription of glialdifferentiation genes. On the other hand, the Notch signaling pathway is capable of promoting gliogenesis in stem cells through the inhibition of proneural genes, such as mash1 and neurogenins. In cell- cycle regulation fate In vertebrates, although proneural genes determine the neural fate of progenitors, they also promote the arrest of their division stage by the isolation of already specified progenitor cells from the influence of extrinsic fate-determining cues. Proneural genes regulate cell cycle by the activation of cyclin-dependent kinase (‘’Cdk’’) inhibitors in some lineages at the level of neuronal-differentiation genes. On the other hand, in invertebrates like Drosophila, proneural genes are expressed mainly in non-dividing cells, but could also be expressed in dividing-cells, where Achaete-scute complex proneural genes have been shown to inhibit cell-cycle progression. In the development of sensory organs The proneural genes also have an important role in the development of distinct types of sensory organs, namely chordotonal organs (proprioceptorsthat detect mechanical and sound vibrations) and external sensory organs. Members of achaete-scute complex, such as achaete and scute, as well as ‘’atonal’’ and ‘’daughterless’’ confer to ectodermal cells the ability to become sensory mother cells (SMCs). In the development of sensory organs there are two main phases: determination and differentiation that may not be mechanistically separable. Proneural proteins are involved in both processes, through the activation of the downstream “differentiating genes” that in turn regulate the induction of sensory-organ-subtype characteristics. The specification of sensory organs by proneural genes is a complex process, since they elicit different cellular contexts. For instance, in Drosophila, atonal (ato) can promote the development of chordotonal organs, for the receptors of olfactory sense organs, depending on the imaginal disc in which it is expressed. In Drosophila’s embryogenesis, the proneural gene achaete is expressed in well- determined regions as in the endoderm, being responsible for the formation of particular sensory organs in the adult and larvae. According to Ruíz-Gomes and Ghysen (1993), this expression occurs in two distinct phases: a competent state, in which the proneural gene is expressed in a cell cluster; a determined state, in which a specific cell accumulate high levels of ‘’ac’’ transcripts, originating a neural precursor. The function of each of the ASC complex genes varies with the development state (larvae or adult). For example, in the adult state the ac and sc genes promote the differentiation of two sets of complementary sensory organs and ase gene as a minimal function, while in the larvae state ac and sc genes affect the same set of sensory organs and ase is responsible for the determination of a complementary set. In corticogenesis In the neocortex exists a wide neuronal network, supported by astrocytes and oligodendrocytes (glial cells) with different functions. During cortical development, bHLH factors control proliferation and differentiation of neural cells and their functions at any given time and place depends on their cellular context. NeuroD, Ngns, Mash, ‘’Olig’’ and other proneural gene families have a crucial role in cell fate decision during corticogenesis and different combinations of them regulate the choice and the timing of differentiation into a neuron, an astrocyte or an oligodendrocyte. High levels of Ngn1 and Ngn2 are required to specify neuronal identity of cortical progenitors only in early stages of neocortex development. Particularly, ngn2 is also important to regulate the transition of cortical progenitors from the ventricular zone to the subventricular zone. On the other hand, mash1 is implicated in the early differentiation of striatum neurons and sufficient to promote basal cell divisions independently of its role in the specification of neuronal cell fates at later stages. Cooperation between ngn2 and mash1 proneural genes regulate the transition of cortical progenitors from apical to basal cell compartments. The specification of different neuronal subtypes depends on the group of proneural genes involved. Low levels of proneural transcripts in ventricular zone are expressed when progenitor’s specification occurs and an increase in their expression results in the beginning of neurogenesis. Ngns are responsible for the formation of glutamatergic neurons whereas mash1 gives rise to GABAergic and cholinergic neurons. In Drosophila photoreceptor development The proneural protein Atonal (Ato) is responsible for the development of Drosophila’s R8 photoreceptors. However, it does not act alone, since it dimerizes with a second identical protein, ‘’Daughterless (Da)’’ that reinforces its expression. The coexpression of ‘’Ato’’ and ‘’Da’’ is important for the migration of the different cell types of an ommatidium and for the repression of atonal in the inter-cluster spaces, functioning as inhibitory signals that regulate both the number and position of the nascent R8 cells. Moreover, this expression leads to the activation of the kinase MAPK that is important for the cellular recruitment and the repressor effect, once, when this kinase is inactive the expression of ‘’Ato’’ is detected in every cell. In an initial state, Hedgehog (‘’Hh’’) and Decapentaplegic are responsible for the activation of ‘’ato’’ in small cellular clusters, leading to the activation of MAPK. First, Hedgehog induces ‘’ato’’ expression in more than just the cells that ultimately become photoreceptor cells, so its expression has to be refined and restricted to a single presumptive R8 cell. Hedgehog signaling is also required to repress ‘’atonal’’ expression between the nascent proneural clusters, which reveals a dual role crucial to building precision and geometry into the adult retina. Therefore, the regulation of ‘’ato’’ expression depends on the levels of Hedgehog: at low levels (that is far from the source) this pronuclear gene is activated and at high levels (close to the source) it is repressed. Combining lateral inhibition with the dual role played by Hedgehog, one can imagine how the hexagonal array of R8 cells can be patterned. ===Non- neural functions=== Besides their role in the nervous system development, proneural genes are also involved in processes related to trophoblast invasion, endocrine cell differentiation (namely in pancreas and adenohypophysis), sex determination and lungs, thyroid, adrenal and salivary glands and gastrointestinal system development. In human trophoblast invasion Additionally to their involvement in neuronal and glial differentiation, sex determination and sensory organs development, proneural genes are also involved in trophoblast differentiation during progression of invasion, in placental formation. Studies revealed the expression of neuroD1, neuroD2 and ‘’ath2’’ transcripts in different subsets of invasive trophoblast. In pancreas development In the developing pancreas, transcription factor ngn3’marks the populations of cells that are in transit from undifferentiated epithelial progenitor cells to mature endocrine cells (precursors of pancreatic endocrine cells), and thus that do not express hormones yet, which suggests that this gene is turned off in differentiated hormone-positive. ngn3’’ is both necessary and sufficient to drive the formation of islet cells during pancreatic development, in a manner similar to the specification of neural fate in neuroectoderm. In sex determination Although neurogenesis and sex determination appear to be different biological processes, there is evidence that ‘’daughterless (da’’) - an essential gene for the formation of the entire Drosophila peripheral nervous system - is also required for proper sex determination. In flies, scute works to direct neuronal development, but this gene also acquired a role in the primary event of sex determination – X chromosome counting – by becoming an X chromosome signal element (XSE). In myogenesis Although proneural genes operate in the ectoderm, lethal of scute acts in the somatic mesoderm to define cell cluster from which muscle progenitors will be single out. The interaction between these cells and ectoderm, leads to the formation of muscle founder cells, in an analogous process to the one that occurs in the central nervous system. In cell migration ngn1 and ngn2 can regulate independently the mechanisms of the cell migration and are involved in the initial downregulation of RhoA right before neural progenitor cells become postmitotic, whereas neuroD is primarily involved in the continuous suppression of RhoA during the cortical migration. Other bHLH factors like ‘’math2’’, neuroD2 and ‘’nscl1’’ can suppress RhoA expression and regulate the migration machinery in postmitotic neurons. ==References== Category:Developmental genes and proteins ","title":"Proneural genes"},{"id":"42064075","text":"The Regenboldshorn (or Rägeboldshore; 2,193 m) is a mountain of the Bernese Alps, located between Lenk and Adelboden in the canton of Bern.

In the years 1640-1641 he is mentioned as a pupil in the records of the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke. He subsequently became a master of the Guild and was still registered as such in 1659.Jacob de Formentrou at the Netherlands Institute for Art History The painting A gentleman courting a lady music making in a courtyard dated 1668 (sold at Christie's on 10 December 2010, London, lot 2122) constitutes the last recorded information on de Formentrou.Jacob de Formentrou - A gentleman courting a lady music making in a courtyard, on Christie's website ==Work== Elegant company on a terrace Only a few works by his hand are known today. These can all be classified as genre paintings, in particular paintings of merry companies and gallery pictures. ===Merry companies=== The few paintings attributed to de Formentrou include the paintings Interior of an art gallery and Elegant company on a terrace, both in private collections as well as Playing Backgammon (present location unknown).Hannelore Magnus, 'Schilders, connoisseurs en hun (Salomons)oordeel, Het Schilderijenkabinet (1659) van Jacob de Formentrou en Erasmus II Quellinus', Published by Werkgroep De Zeventiende Eeuw The first two belong to the genre of the merry company depicting a group of people enjoying themselves. The genre was popular in Flanders as well as in the Dutch Republic in the 17th century. ===Gallery paintings=== Two compositions belonging to the genre of the 'gallery paintings' are attributed to him: the Interior of an art gallery (private collection) and the Cabinet of pictures, currently in the Royal Collection.Jacob de Formentrou (fl.164059), A cabinet of pictures, at the Royal Collection The 'gallery paintings' genre is native to Antwerp where Frans Francken the Younger and Jan Brueghel the Elder were the first artists to create paintings of art and curiosity collections in the 1620s.Susan Merriam, SeventeenthCentury Flemish Garland Paintings. Still Life, Vision and the Devotional Image, Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2012 Gallery paintings depict large rooms in which many paintings and other precious items are displayed in elegant surroundings. The earliest works in this genre depicted art objects together with other items such as scientific instruments or peculiar natural specimens. The genre became immediately quite popular and was followed by other artists such as Jan Brueghel the Younger, Cornelis de Baellieur, Hans Jordaens, David Teniers the Younger, Gillis van Tilborch and Hieronymus Janssens.Marr, Alexander (2010) 'The Flemish 'Pictures of Collections' Genre: An Overview', Intellectual History Review, 20: 1, 5–25 Cabinet of Pictures De Formentrou's best known painting is the gallery painting referred to as Cabinet of pictures (also known as Art lovers in a painting cabinet), currently in the Royal Collection. It depicts a room full of pictures populated with human figures who are usually interpreted as representing art connoisseurs. The various pictures that are hung on the walls of the room represent works of leading artists of de Formentrou's generation working in Antwerp in the middle and second half of the 17th century. The composition also includes portraits of Rubens and van Dyck, the two eminent Antwerp artists of the previous generation. Gallery paintings can represent actual collections or imaginary collections. A cabinet of pictures depicts an imaginary gallery and can be seen as a summing up of the best of what artists in mid 17th-century Antwerp could produce.Nadia Sera Baadj, Monstrous creatures and diverse strange things\\": The Curious Art of Jan van Kessel the Elder (16261679), A dissertation submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy (History of Art) in The University of Michigan, 2012 A number of issues relating to the composition are still not resolved entirely. First of all the date of the painting. As an early essay incorrectly dated the painting to 1683, it was assumed for many years to be the composition given that year as a present to the attorney Jan van Baveghem by members of Antwerp's Guild of St. Luke. However, after the discovery in the painting of dates in the 1650s the 1683 date was rejected. The date of the painting is now put at 1654 by F.G. Meijer (as one of the presumed collaborators of the painting died the next year) while Hannelore Magnus dates it to 1659.Art lovers in a painting cabinet at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Art historians are also not unanimous in their view of whether the painting was a collaboration between a few painters or a large group of painters. On the basis of an iconographic analysis Hannelore Magnus comes to the conclusion that the painting is not a collaboration between all the artists whose works are represented in the painting but rather represents the combined effort of de Formentrou and Erasmus Quellinus II, a leading Antwerp painter. F. G. Meijer on the other hand believes that the composition is a collaboration between all of the artists whose work are depicted. He attributes the composition and the various pictures depicted in it as follows: *Jacob de Formentrou: the interior and figures; *Jan Davidsz. de Heem: the fruit still life in the middle left, signed I D Heem; *Erasmus Quellinus the Younger: the painting above the chimney and the sculptures in the interior; *Joris van Son: the cartouche still life on the right of the back wall, signed J.VAN'SON *Pieter Neefs the Elder or Pieter Neefs the Younger: the church interior at the right of the fireplace, dated and monogrammed:1654/PN; *Jan Peeters I: the landscape to the right of the cartouche still life, monogrammed i.P; *Hendrick Andriessen: the vanitas still life at the bottom left on the right-hand wall, monogrammed HA; *possibly Peter de Witte (II): the landscape in the middle high on the right-hand wall, monogrammed PDW; *Jan van Kessel the Elder: the insect study on white background on the right above the door, monogrammed IVK; *Pieter Boel: the still life of a dead swan high up on the right of the right-hand wall, signed P.BOEL; *Nicolaas van Eyck: the equestrian battle, which is the second-highest on the right of the right-hand wall, signed N.V.EYCK; *Gaspar de Witte: the landscape right of the door, signed G.D.WITTE; and *Anonymous, dated 165(3?): various paintings and copies. The painting can be read as a reference to connoisseurship, and in particular the connoisseur's activity of evaluating the authorship of paintings based on stylistic characteristics. It can also be regarded as a carefully crafted advertisement of the current talent and past legacy of the Antwerp school of painting. ==References * Category:Flemish Baroque painters Category:Flemish genre painters Category:People from Antwerp Category:Members of the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke Category:Year of birth uncertain ","title":"Jacob de Formentrou"},{"id":"42064102","text":"Ch'iyar Jaqhi (Aymara ch'iyara black, jaqhi precipice, cliff, \\"black cliff\\", Hispanicized spellings Chearaje, Chiar Jakke, Chiaracce, Chiaraje, Chiaraji, Chiaraque, Chiarjakke, Chiarjaque) may refer to: * Ch'iyar Jaqhi (Azángaro), a mountain in the Azángaro Province, Puno Region, Peru * Ch'iyar Jaqhi (Cusco), a mountain in the Cusco Region, Peru * Ch'iyar Jaqhi (Cusco-Puno), a mountain in the Cusco Region and in the Puno Region, Peru * Ch'iyar Jaqhi (La Paz), a mountain in the La Paz Department, Bolivia * Ch'iyar Jaqhi (Melgar), a mountain in the Melgar Province, Puno Region, Peru * Ch'iyar Jaqhi (Moquegua), a mountain in the Mariscal Nieto Province, Moquegua Region, Peru * Ch'iyar Jaqhi (Moquegua-Puno), a mountain on the border of the Moquegua Region and the Puno Region, Peru * Ch'iyar Jaqhi (Pagador), a mountain in the Sebastián Pagador Province, Oruro Department, Bolivia * Ch'iyar Jaqhi (Potosí), a mountain in the Potosí Department, Bolivia * Ch'iyar Jaqhi (Sajama), a mountain in the Turco Municipality, Sajama Province, Oruro Department, Bolivia * Ch'iyar Jaqhi (Tacna), a mountain in the Tacna Region, Peru * Ch'iyar Jaqhi (Umurata), a mountain near Umurata in the Turco Municipality, Sajama Province, Oruro Department, Bolivia ","title":"Ch'iyar Jaqhi"},{"id":"42064125","text":"The fifth season of the animated series WordGirl was originally broadcast on PBS in the United States from September 10, 2012 to June 14, 2013.

However, Mazyar returned in 822/23 with the support of the Abbasid Caliphate to take revenge. Shapur, who was the son and successor of Shahriyar I, was defeated and killed along with Vinda-Umid. Mazyar then united Tabaristan under his own rule. Mazyar, however, later rebelled against the Abbasid Caliphate, an act which was widely supported by the native Zoroastrians, who began plundering the Muslim villages. The Tahirid ruler Abdallah ibn Tahir al-Khurasani and the Abbasid caliph al-Mu'tasim shortly sent five corps that entered Tabaristan from all sides. Mazyar made his brother Quhyar as the defender of the Qarinvand mountains, and the Bavandid Qarin I as the defender of eastern Tabaristan. However, the fall of Tabaristan went quickly: several cities were caught by surprise, while Qarin I betrayed Mazyar and agreed to aid the Abbasids in exchange for being restored as the ruler of the Bavand dynasty. The people of Sari shortly revolted against Mazyar, and Quhyar betrayed Mazyar, and had him captured and given to al-Mu'tasim. Mazyar was shortly brought to Samarra, where he was executed. His body later became gibbeted with the body of the Khurramite Babak Khorramdin. Quhyar, who had just ascended the Qarinvand throne, however, was shortly killed by his own Dailamite soldiers because of his betrayal against Mazyar.

When she was nine she danced at the Pantomime Theatre in the Tivoli Gardens. She studied privately under Hans Brenaa and later under prima ballerina Edite Feifere Frandsen from Latvia who trained her using the Vaganova method. ==CareerDancing=== On entering the Royal Danish Ballet School, she learned the techniques of Bournonville ballet with such ease that she immediately joined the company, making her début in 1966 when she was 16 in Jerome Robbins' (Afternoon of a Faun). She also performed in David Lichine's Graduation Ball. Her real breakthrough came in 1971 when she danced Clara in The Nutcracker, specially choreographed for her by Flemming Flindt. Bjørn has performed particularly well in a number of Bournonville's ballets, including the title role in La Sylphide and Eleonore and Johanna in Kermes in Bruges. Among other principal roles were the First Pas de deux in Rudi van Dantzig's Vier Letzte Lieder and the title role in Michel Fokine's Petrushka.

Along with Loipa Araújo, Josefina Méndez, and Mirta Plá, she is regarded as one of the \\"four jewels of Cuban ballet\\". She was a principal artist with the Cuban National Ballet (Ballet Nacional de Cuba; BNC). ==Early years== Bosch was born in Havana. In 1951, after her family saw an advertisement in the newspaper, Bosch received a scholarship to attend the Alicia Alonso Ballet Academy, now the Cuban National Ballet School. There, she trained with Magda González Mora, José Parés and Fernando Alonso. Her stage debut occurred with the Ballet Alicia Alonso, now the BNC, in 1954 in a production of Swan Lake. ==Career== She joined the BNC company in 1956. However, her small stature initially prevented her from assuming roles of relevance, relegating her to the corps de ballet. But in her first year, before the temporary closure of the BNC, a ballerina was absent for a performance in Matanzas, and Bosch was asked to take her place in Les Sylphides, where she made her true professional debut in a leading role. In 1958, Alicia Alonso asked Bosch to participate in the corps de ballet of Giselle at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles, and the following year the ballet Coppélia. While in California, she also performed with Ballet Celeste in San Francisco. At the same time, Bosh began a long career as a ballet teacher at Alicia Alonso school. In 1959 the new revolutionary Cuban government made ballet into a \\"national art form\\" and Bosch having completed her studies, participated in ballet auditions at the newly formed BNC. In the same year, she made an extensive tour of South America with the company and the following year to Mexico and Eastern Europe, which lasted until 1961. Promoted to the rank of soloist in 1962, she gradually assumed roles within the company's traditional and contemporary repertoire. In 1963, she portrayed one of the friends in the Enrique Pineda Barnet film Giselle, which was produced by the Instituto Cubano del Arte e Industria Cinematográficos and starring Alicia Alonso. In 1967, she was promoted to prima ballerina at the BNC and still later served as ballet master. At an invitation from José Antonio Ruiz, she taught at the Ballet Nacional de España. She was associated with the Ballet Clásico de México, Ballet Independiente y Ballet Clásico, Romanian National Opera, Moscow Ballet, Ballet de Victor Ullate, Royal Ballet of Denmark, International Summer Stage of Madrid, Ballet Zurich, Boston Ballet, Central School of London, National Ballet Hungary and the Vienna State Opera.

One of the turns was provided by more than forty local school-children, wearing snow maiden and Eskimo costumes made in part from cotton wool, even though its use was prohibited in theatres, due to the risk of fire. As a group of 13 children were leaving the stage, one of their costumes caught fire: within moments, all 13 were alight. By the end of the night, despite rescue efforts by members of the cast and audience, six children had died. Two more died subsequently from their burns. == Inquest == The subsequent inquest heard conflicting claims. Faith Mailes, the concert organiser, whose daughter died, said that she had seen a smoker, backstage, discard a match. Theatre staff and others present denied that anyone had been smoking. Verdicts of accidental death were returned. == Funerals and legacy == A joint funeral for five of the victims was held at Hereford Cathedral. The public stood \\"ten deep\\" in parts of nearby Broad Street as the funeral corteges passed. Soldiers served as pall-bearers. The girls were buried at Hereford Cemetery, but the precise location of their graves is lost.

That target was exceeded, and the cot was unveiled there, together with a memorial plaque, in April 1917. The theatre was rebuilt later in 1916, but subsequently demolished. Another plaque, mentioning the fire, marks its former location, on Widemarsh Street. Local residents campaigned for a \\"lasting memorial\\" near the site. This campaign inspired Hereford Cathedral and architect Robert Kilgour to commission a memorial plaque, cast in lead. The commission was accepted by Carey Lead Ltd. and installation was carried out on 15 March 2018.

Gox. He moved to Japan in 2009. ==Early life and education== Karpelès was born in 1985 in Chenôve, France, the child of Anne-Robert Karpelès, a geologist. He was raised in Dijon. Between 1995 and 2000 he was educated at Collège Prieuré de Binson in Châtillon-sur-Marne, near Dormans. He then spent one year at Lycée Claude Bernard in Paris before completing his education in 2003 at Lycée Louis Armand in Paris. ==Career== According to Karpelès' LinkedIn page, he worked from 2003 to 2005 at Linux Cyberjoueurs as a software developer and network administrator. Karpelès is a PHP developer. In 2009, Karpelès founded Tibanne Co. Ltd., a Japan-based bitcoin related technology provider. He is CEO.https://www.cnbc.com/id/101486280 He was a founding member of the Bitcoin Foundation, created in 2012 with a mission to standardize and promote bitcoin, and served on its board until February 2014. Karpelès acquired the Mt. Gox Bitcoin exchange site from programmer Jed McCaleb in 2011 which was later incorporated in Tokyo, with its original owner receiving 12% shares of the new company.https://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20140310-712183.html Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in Japan on February 28, 2014, and for Chapter 15, Title 11, United States Code bankruptcy in the United States (Texas) in March 2014. The document, signed by \\"Robert Marie Mark Karpeles\\", was published by Ars Technica on the Scribd website, and according to Ars Technica is a court document filed in US Bankruptcy Court. Karpelès was subpoenaed by the United States Department of the Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network to appear in Washington, D.C. to provide testimony on April 18, 2014. In a court filing by Mt. Gox lawyers, Karpelès responded that he did not have a lawyer for this matter and therefore declined to appear. He sought to appear in D.C. to testify on May 5, 2014. According to a joint report by Cyrus Farivar of Ars Technica and Pierre Alonso of Le Monde, Karpelès was found guilty of fraud when he was tried in absentia in France in 2010. He also admitted to having \\"pirated\\" a server to French authorities. He was sentenced to a suspended year in jail. The lawyers for Ross William Ulbricht, defending him at his trial for operating the undercover Silk Road marketplace, claimed in 2015 that the pseudonymous \\"Dread Pirate Roberts\\" behind Silk Road was not him but Karpelès. The Department of Homeland Security had also suspected as such in 2012-2013. Karpelès publicly denied the claim on Twitter and Ulbricht was eventually found guilty. After the collapse of Mt. Gox, Karpelès joined London Trust Media, the company behind Freenode and Private Internet Access, as its CTO in April 2018. ==Arrest and prosecution== Karpelès was arrested on August 1, 2015, by Japanese police on suspicion of having accessed the exchange's computer system to falsify data on its outstanding balance; he was re-arrested and allegedly charged with embezzlement. Karpelès was released on bail in July 2016, but was required to remain in Japan. On July 10, 2017, he pled \\"not guilty\\" to embezzlement and data manipulation charges. On March 14, 2019, the Tokyo District Court found Karpelès guilty of falsifying data to inflate Mt. Gox’s holdings by $33.5 million, for which he was sentenced to 30 months in prison, suspended for four years, meaning he will serve no time unless he commits additional offenses over the next four years. The Court acquitted Karpelès on a number of other charges, including embezzlement and aggravated breach of trust, based on its belief that Karpelès had acted without ill intent. Nonetheless, the verdict said Karpelès had inflicted “massive harm to the trust of his users” and there was “no excuse” for him to “abuse his status and authority to perform clever criminal acts.” Karpelès issued a statement saying he was “happy to be judged not guilty” on the more serious charges and was discussing how to proceed with his lawyers regarding his conviction on the falsifying data charge. ==Bankruptcy proceedings== Mt. Gox's bankruptcy proceedings will repay creditors in Japanese yen at a price around 483 US dollars per bitcoin (total of 45.6 billion Japanese yen or 400 million US dollars) and it has been reported that this will leave Karpelès, after creditors are repaid, with the bulk of the wealth left over from the difference. Based on the market price at the beginning of 2018 (around $15,000 per bitcoin), the difference is significant, and would leave Karpelès with bitcoins valued at more than 1.4 billion US dollars. In June 2018, The Tokyo District court approved a petition by creditors to begin civil rehabilitation proceedings in lieu of bankruptcy. As these proceedings are more flexible, creditors expected that they would be compensated based on the current value of their lost coins. On August 23 2018, creditors were able to begin filing new claims under the civil rehabilitation proceedings. Under the current schedule, compensation is expected to be distributed in late 2019. ==References * Category:1985 births Category:Businesspeople in software Category:French computer criminals Category:French chief executives Category:French computer programmers Category:French fraudsters Category:French expatriates in Japan Category:Living people Category:People associated with Bitcoin Category:PHP writers ","title":"Mark Karpelès"},{"id":"42064876","text":"The men's kumite 75 kilograms competition at the 2006 Asian Games in Doha, Qatar was held on 13 December 2006 at the Qatar SC Indoor Hall. ==Schedule== All times are Arabia Standard Time (UTC+03:00) {class = \\"\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ! width=220Date ! width=50Time ! width=150Event -  rowspan=7Wednesday, 13 December 2006  13:00  1/16 finals -  13:00  1/8 finals -  13:00  Quarterfinals -  13:00  Semifinals -  13:00  Repechage 1R -  13:00  Repechage 2R -  13:00  bgcolor=ffffccFinals } ==ResultsMain bracket=== Final Top half Bottom half ===Repechage=References== *Results ==External links== *Official website Men's kumite 75 kg ","title":"Karate at the 2006 Asian Games – Men's kumite 75 kg"},{"id":"42064902","text":"Ebrahim Moosa is Professor of Islamic Studies at the University of Notre Dame in the Department of History and the Kroc Institute for International Studies.

It is located east of Benkovac. ==Population/Demographics== According to 1991 census, there were 652 inhabitants, of which 578 (88.65%) were Serbs; 70 (10.73%) were Croats and 4 others. According to national census of 2011, population of the settlement is 92. ==Bilina== Bilina is a historic late-medieval site close to modern Bjelina. Bilina is its medieval name, as opposed to post-Ottoman Bjelina. The site () is known as the seat of the Drašković noble family in the 15th century and in the beginning of the 16th century. Bartol (English: Bartholomew) Drašković, the head of the family, had an estate with the castle there. His wife Ana Drašković née Utješinović, a sister of the Catholic cardinal Juraj Utješinović (George Utissenich alias George Martinuzzi), bore him on February 5, 1525, the firstborn son Juraj (English: George), a famous Croatian Catholic Bishop, Cardinal and statesman, who was the Ban (Viceroy) of Croatia between 1567 and 1578. Younger sons of Bartol and Ana, Ivan I (English: John) and Gašpar I (English: Casper), were most probably also born there. Shortly after that, because of the threatening Ottoman expansion, the family left its old seat and withdrew toward the northwest of Croatia. As the Ottoman army soon conquered the whole area around Bilina, the Drašković family could not come back any more.

They were published as a set and are usually performed and recorded together. == Composition == This work was composed along with a series of vocal compositions based on texts by Hungarian poet Sándor Weöres. It was composed in 1955 in Budapest, but was first performed thirteen years later, on March 16, 1968, in Stockholm, with the Swedish Radio Choir under the baton of Eric Ericson. It was eventually published by Schott Music. This was the last vocal composition by Ligeti in which he used his early compositional style, for he announced that in Lux Aeterna (1966) he \\"broke with (his) preceding style of chromatic tone clusters\\". After this composition, Ligeti only retook texts by Weöres again 30 years later, with Magyar Etüdök. == Analysis == The composition takes approximately four minutes to perform and features some of Ligeti's traits from early compositions. The text has been translated into English and German by the composer. The piece is well known among musicians and musicologists for its use of canon for creating clusters of sound and the juxtaposition of opposing ideas. Éjszaka is scored for a typical mixed chorus: sopranos, altos, tenors, and basses. It starts with only two words (Rengeteg tövis) being such progressively by the whole chorus in an hypnotizing Andante con moto. However, Reggel is a five-part composition, scored for sopranos, mezzo-sopranos, altos, tenors, and basses, and is a much more lively and fast movement (marked Vivace, stridente). The central section of Reggel is marked with a Più mosso. Prestissimo molto leggiero, where the choir plays very fast and short eighth notes while tenor and soprano solo voices sing Kikeriki (\\"Cock-a-doodle-do\\") using falsetto. The third section is much slower, which returns to the Tempo I, and finishes the piece. == See also == * List of compositions by György Ligeti == References  External links == * A preview of the score Category:Compositions by György Ligeti Category:1955 compositions Category:Contemporary classical compositions Category:Choral compositions ","title":"Éjszaka – Reggel"},{"id":"42065026","text":"The Yamaha Tesseract was a hybrid electric concept vehicle introduced by Yamaha at the 2007 Tokyo Motor Show.

A passionate quest in search of emotion through music drives the group to produce a diverse musical programme. From the Middles Age to Baroque, Musica Nova departs into various musical periods and universes. The ensemble approaches its music with an eye for historical accuracy, through the use of original manuscripts. Working with the documents from the era is conducted with reflection upon the musical rules of the time (such as musica ficta and pronunciation) as well as the intended nuances of the pieces. The singers and musicians read their music in facsimile and their interpretation of it is thus inevitably modified. The result is a sound, a movement, a line, which makes Musica Nova so exceptionally rich and vibrant; the acoustic of which transports the listener; temporally and spiritually. The Musica Nova Ensemble appears on prestigious stages in France and all over the world.

Alexander Ollongren (born November 9, 1928) is a professor emeritus at Leiden University. He serves on the Advisory Council of METI (Messaging Extraterrestrial Intelligence). ==Personal life== Alexander Ollongren was born on November 9, 1928 on a coffee plantation in Kepahiang, in the southwestern part of Sumatra, Netherlands East Indies. His father, Alexander Ollongren (1901–1989), was born in Russia and of mixed Finnish and Swedish descent. He was a member of the Finnish noble family, Ållongren, and his mother, Selma Hedwig Adèle Jaeger (1901–2000), was of Dutch and German heritage. The family moved to Java in early 1932 and lived in Yogyakarta, while the Japanese army occupied the Netherlands East Indies in 1942. In 1945, the family was interned at various Japanese internment camps, most notably Fort van den Bosch in the modern Ngawi Regency. After the war, Ollongren was further educated in Jakarta. The family stayed in Australia for six months in order to recuperate and later moved to Netherlands where Ollongren decided to enroll in Leiden University. He married Gunvor Ulla Marie Lundgren, a Swede, in 1965 in Jönköping. Their children are Karin Hildur (Kajsa) Ollongren, a noted liberal politician and government minister, born in 1967, and Peter Gunnar Ollongren, born in 1970. ==Education== His education at Leiden University started with undergraduate and graduate studies in mathematics, Hamiltonian mechanics, physics, and astronomy, after which he gained his MSc degree in 1955. After completing his master's degree, he served almost two years in the military. In 1958, he started his doctoral research in galactic astronomy, supervised by Jan H. Oort and Hendrik C. van de Hulst of the Astronomical Department at Leiden. His research topic was the three-dimensional orbital motions of stars in the galaxy. Characterizing orbital stellar motion in a galaxy could not be done analytically, so a number of sample orbits had to be computed using the rudimentary computers of the time. In cooperation with astronomer Ingrid Torgård (1918–2001) of Lund Observatory in Sweden, the then famous and extremely fast electronic computer BESK in Stockholm was programmed to do the necessary computing. The analysis of the problem, together with the computational results and Ollongren's interpretation of them, earned him a PhD degree in astronomy from Leiden University in 1962. ==CareerLeiden University=== In 1961, the Leiden University Council decided that the university was in need of an institute to operate and manage a fast electronic computer in order to meet computing demands from a wide range of institutions. Thus, the Central Computing Institute was created. A modern, transistorized computer, built by the Dutch company Electrologica, was installed and Ollongren was appointed Acting Director of the Institute. A year later he became Associate Director of the university computer centre. As demands for computing services were increasing in the university, it became evident that the central computing institute would need more powerful computer facilities. After the appointment of Guus Zoutendijk, mathematician, as General Director in 1964, switching to an IBM mainframe was seriously considered and eventually effected. In the wake of the new orientation, Ollongren was granted a leave of absence. ===Yale University=== After being invited by Dirk Brouwer, for approximately a year and a half, between 1965 and 1967, Ollongren was a postdoctoral visiting research member in celestial mechanics and lecturer in mathematics at the well-known Research Center of Celestial Mechanics at Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut. While in the United States, he became well acquainted with the programming and use of modern, large-size IBM computing equipment. He then returned to the newly created Department of Applied Mathematics at Leiden University, and in 1968, became a lecturer in numerical mathematics and computer science. A year later, he became an Associate Professor in theoretical computer science, covering aspects of programming languages. In 1971, he was granted another leave of absence, enabling him to accept the position of Visiting Research Member at the IBM Research Laboratory in Vienna, Austria for three months. ===Return to Leiden University=== In 1980, Ollongren became a Full Professor of computer science at Leiden, specializing in the semantics of programming languages. That same year, he spent a half year sabbatical at the Department of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence of Linköping University in Sweden. Several years later, the computer science section of the department became the Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science (LIACS). Ollongren retired at the age of 65 years. He became Emeritus Professor of Leiden University in November 1993, delivering the public lecture called Vix Famulis Audenda Parat, including an invited speech by ‘Alan Turing’, which was enacted by George K. Miley, a university astronomer, in the University’s auditorium. Ollongren is a member of several societies of computer science; astronomy, including the International Astronomical Union; and astronautics. ==SETI== After his retirement, he became interested in the academic debate on the Search for ExtraTerrestrial Intelligence (SETI), within the International Astronautical Academy. In particular, he wrote several studies in the field of interstellar communication with extraterrestrials. He also developed a new version of Lincos, a universally comprehensible language based on logic for the purpose of communication with extraterrestrial intelligence. His major contribution to this field is his book, Astrolinguistics, was published by Springer in 2013. ==Further reading== *Astrolinguistics, Design of a Linguistic System for Interstellar Communication Based on Logic (New York: Springer, 2013) *Definition of programming languages by interpreting automata (London: Academic Press, 1974) == References == Category:1928 births Category:Living people Category:Dutch computer scientists Category:Dutch astronomers Category:Interstellar messages Category:Jonkheers of the Netherlands Category:Leiden University faculty Category:Leiden University alumni Category:People from Sumatra Category:Russian people of Dutch descent Category:Russian people of German descent Category:Dutch people of Finnish descent ","title":"Alexander Ollongren"},{"id":"42065104","text":"Firebeatz is a Dutch music producing duo made up of Tim Benjamin Smulders (; born 14 August 1985) and Jurre van Doeselaar (; born 7 July 1987) that formed in Tilburg in 2008.

His father, world-renowned dermatologist Arieh Dostrovsky, became a founder of Hebrew University's medical school and of the Hadassah hospital. His first cousin, Yaacov Dori (born Yakov Dostrovsky) became the first IDF Chief of Staff.:he:אריה דוסטרובסקי As a 13-year-old science whiz, he volunteered as a signaler for the Haganah, the corps that was later to become the Israel Defense Forces, clambering up mountains to send military messages across the country with light-reflecting mirrors. He also belonged to a pioneering youth group that established the kibbutz Maoz Haim, but it was obvious to all he would be more useful to the country as a scientist. After attending the Gymnasia high school in Jerusalem, he earned a B.Sc. in chemistry in 1940 and a Ph.D. in physical chemistry in 1943, both from University College London. ==Career== After working as a lecturer in chemistry at University College in North Wales for five years, Dostrovsky returned to Israel, joining the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot in 1948, shortly before the Institute's dedication. The Institute's five scientific departments were to be headed by world-class scientists from various countries, but just then the War of Independence broke, and only two of the appointed scientific leaders dared to move to Israel. Dostrovsky, then only 30, filled one of the three vacant leadership positions: he was appointed Head of the Isotope Research Department, a post he held for 17 years. In the late 1940s, he established a semi-industrial facility separating oxygen isotopes on the Weizmann Institute's campus. It produced water enriched with heavy oxygen isotopes commonly used in medical diagnostic procedures. He conducted research in several areas and was mentor to generations of young scientists When the Israel Atomic Energy Commission was established in 1953, Dostrovsky became its first Director of Research; from 1965 to 1971, he served as its Director- General. Upon returning to the Weizmann Institute, he was appointed Vice President and, two years later, elected fifth President of the Institute, a position he held for three years. In 1975, he was named Institute Professor. Turning his attention to the subject of water, he served as Chairman of Israel's Desalination Committee from 1966 to 1981. Global disillusionment in the nuclear power spurred him on to an interest in renewable sources of energy. He placed the need to exploit solar energy for diverse purposes on the Weizmann Institute and national agenda. Returning later to the basic aspects of nuclear reactions, he and his colleagues represented Israel at GALLEX, an experiment conducted by an international team in an underground laboratory in Italy’ Gran Sasso region, with the aim of measuring the flux of neutrinos, fundamental particles that reach the earth from the core of the sun. On the international scene, he served as a member of the Scientific Advisory Committee of the United Nations’ International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna (1973-1981) and was a member of the Executive Committee of the International Energy Agency's SolarPACES project (1991-1993). His prizes and honors include the Ramsey Medal and Prize, 1943; Tel Aviv's Weizmann Prize, 1952; honorary doctorates from Tel Aviv University, 1973, and the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology, 1994; and the Israel Prize, 1995. He was a member of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities and an honorary life member of the New York Academy of Science. He was elected a Fellow of the American Physical Society in 2003. ==References * Haim Harari.

Aunor also recorded the song \\"Hiwaga Ng Pag-ibig\\" featured in film. The film depicts one of the earliest portrayals of LGBT themes in Philippine cinema during a time of heavier censorship and more conservative audiences. The word t-bird is a Filipino slang term for a butch lesbian. The screenplay was written by activist Portia Ilagan who is openly gay. In 2015, 33 years after the film's original release, T-Bird at Ako was digitally restored and re-mastered as one of the 75 films restored by ABS-CBN Film Archives, in collaboration with Central Digital Labs. ==Synopsis== Feisty lawyer Sylvia Salazar (Aunor) has made a name for herself but is still dissatisfied and uncertain, including her future with brilliant colleague Jake (Abuel) who persistently asks for her hand in marriage. As she witnesses a performance by a local dancer named Sabel (Santos) at a local bar, Sylvia realizes her attraction to her. Sabel, who is a struggling burgis working several jobs suddenly finds herself in the center of a scandal when she is harassed and threatened to be raped by the son of a rich tycoon whom she ends up killing in self-defense. Sylvia hears of this and decides to help Sabel by posting her bail, representing her in court and providing for her now she is unemployed. While preparing for the case, Sylvia learns that Sabel gave birth to a son whom she gave up for adoption 7 years prior, and that the father is a married man who disappeared before learning of her pregnancy. As they continue to live in the same house, the two women begin to warm towards each other. Later, Sabel gets a phone call from an anonymous man from her past who turns out to be Dante (Fernando), the father of her child. Looking to rekindle their romance, he confesses that they lost touch because he went to prison for seven years and that his wife is now dead and they are free to marry. Sylvia learns of Dante's return and fears it might interfere with her budding relationship with Sabel as well as her ongoing case so she sends her assistant Babette (Gonzales) to bribe Dante to disappear again. Sabel is devastated when Dante is nowhere to be found again but she soon figures out that it was Sylvia's doing. Sylvia finally admits her attraction to Sabel, who rejects her saying what she needs is a man, not another woman. Frustrated that she will have nothing if she runs away, Sabel finally gives in to Sylvia's desire for her \\"body\\" and tells her that after the case is won, Sylvia can do anything to her but her heart will not be in it. During the trial, Sylvia proves that the man who attempted to rape Sabel (Israel) has a history of violence and drugs, justifying her plead for self-defense and she is released. As Sabel walks into the hotel room where she is supposed to consummate her relationship with Sylvia, she finds Dante instead, whom Sylvia had contacted. Later, Sylvia finally accepts Jake's suggestion that she dress \\"like a woman\\" and they share a kiss. ==Cast== The film's supporting cast are mostly frequent collaborators of Danny Zialcita, including Suzanne Gonzales and Dindo Fernando. * Vilma Santos as Isabel * Nora Aunor as Sylvia * Dindo Fernando as Dante * Tommy Abuel as Jake * Suzanne Gonzales as Babette * Odette Khan as Maxie * Dick Israel as Dickie * Leila Hermosa as Rubia * Johnny Wilson as Prosecutor * Rosemarie Gil as Mother * Subas Herrero as Father * Liza Lorena as Foster Mother * Alvin Enriquez as Tony * Angie Salinas as Yaya ==Critical reception== The direction is tight and masterful. Although one always gets reminded in a Zialcita film of sequences from foreign films, there is a minimum of unmotivated blocking in this film. Each sequence contributes to the whole film (if there is copying, in other words, and I do think there is in this film, the copying is not done simply to be cute or clever, but in accordance with the logical requirements of the plot). - Isagani R.
