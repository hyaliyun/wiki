Mercator Cooper (September 29, 1803According to the 1850 U.S. Census. Southampton, Suffolk, NY, Roll:M432_602, p. 372; Southampton, Suffolk, NY; Roll:M653_865; p. 140. 1870; Southampton, Suffolk, NY, Series:M593, Roll:1101, p. 198 – spring 1872) was a ship's captain who is credited with the first formal American visit to Edo (now Tokyo), Japan and the first formal landing on the mainland East Antarctica. Both events occurred while sailing ships out of Sag Harbor, New York. ==Early life== Cooper was born in Southampton, New York, to Nathan and Olive (née Howell) Cooper, one of five children, three of whom survived to adulthood. He went to sea on a whaling vessel in the early 1820s. Records show that he visited Guangdong (China) and Patagonia (South America) on whaling expeditions, and that he became captain of a ship in 1832. He married Maria Green at the age of 24, and they had three children: Nathan (died in infancy), Maria, and Sarah. ==Visit of the Manhattan to Tokyo== On November 9, 1843, Cooper left Sag Harbor as captain of the 440-ton ship Manhattan on a whaling voyage. On March 14–15, 1845, its crew rescued 22 shipwrecked Japanese sailors in the Bonin Islands. The first 11 sailors were found on Tori-shima, where Manhattan anchored to hunt for turtles to supplement the ship's provisions, and were survivors from the Koho-maru wrecked en route to Edo. The next day 11 more sailors were found on a foundering Japanese boat Senju-maru (along with a detailed navigation map of Japan).A Cold Welcome in Japan; When a ship sailed into Tokyo's bay, it was met with curiosity and hostility, by Bill Bleyer, Newsday - Long Island Our Story Newsday, January 30, 2011, p. G6, specifies Bonin Islands. The Rotarian of May 1974, however, says the ship was near the Izu Islands, which are much closer to Tokyo Bay. The Manhattan set sail for Edo to repatriate the sailors. Outside Edo Bay four of the survivors took a Japanese boat with a message that Cooper wanted to deliver the remainder to the harbor.The cited Newsday article says four shipwreck survivors went ashore to deliver the message. However the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State thesis Commodore Perry’s 1853 Japanese Expedition: How Whaling Influenced the Event that Revolutionized Japan, by Terry Burcin, says that Cooper went ashore with two of the shipwrecked Japanese and explored the coast and then returned to his ship to await word. The Japanese normally wanted to avoid contact with outsiders due to the Tokugawa shogunate's official policy of national isolation. However, on April 18, 1845, an emissary from the shogunate gave the ship permission to proceed. \\"About three hundred Japanese boats with about 15 men in each took the ship in tow\\", according to Cooper's log. \\"They took all our arms out to keep till we left. There were several of the nobility came on board to see the ship. They appeared very friendly.\\" Japanese accounts place the anchorage of Manhattan at Uraga, at the mouth of Tokyo Bay. It had been over 220 years since so many foreigners had been so close to the Japanese metropolis, but no one from the vessel was permitted to actually land in Japan. The Japanese examined his ship and took particular note of Pyrrhus Concer, a crewman from Southampton, Long Island, who was the only African American on board, and of a Shinnecock Native American named Eleazar. They were the first dark skinned men the Japanese had seen and they wanted to touch their skin. The interpreter from the Japanese side was Moriyama Einosuke, who would later serve during the Perry Expedition. The Japanese refused payment for provisions and gave the ship water, 20 sacks of rice, two sacks of wheat, a box of flour, 11 sacks of sweet potatoes, 50 fowl, two cords of wood, radishes and 10 pounds of tea, and a set of lacquer bowls for the captain, together with a letter from the Shogun. They thanked the Manhattan's crew for returning the shipwrecked sailors and told them to never return, not even to bring back more castaways, on pain of death. On April 21, 500 small boats towed the Manhattan 20 miles out to sea. Cooper took with him the map that charted the islands of Japan that had been found on the disabled Japanese ship. This is now located in the New Bedford Whaling Museum. News of Cooper's encounter was extensively publicized in the United States. Matthew Perry was said to have used the map on his visit to Japan on July 8, 1853. Cooper's home in Southampton is now owned by the Rogers Memorial Library. Pyrrhus Concer is buried in the North End Cemetery in Southampton across from Cooper's home. ==First visitor to Antarctica== In August 1851, Cooper again left Sag Harbor, this time as captain of the 382-ton ship Levant on a mixed whaling and sealing voyage.Starbuck (1878), pp. 490–91. Starbuck says Cooper sent home of \\"bone\\" (whalebone). Making a quick passage through the belt of pack ice in the Ross Sea, on January 26, 1853, he sighted land, an ice shelf backed by a high mountain some distant. The next morning, the ice shelf still in sight, with high mountains looming behind it, he sailed the ship close inshore and ordered a boat to be lowered. They made a landing on the ice shelf, reportedly seeing numerous penguins, but no seals – their chief objective. The landing occurred on what is now known as the Oates Coast of Victoria Land, in East Antarctica. It is arguably \\"the first adequately documented continental landing\\" in not only this area, but on the mainland of Antarctica itself. They stayed within sight of land for several days, sighting the Balleny Islands on February 2.Mills (2003), pp. 160–61.Antarctic Circle – Antarctic First At the conclusion of the voyage the Levant was sold in China. The logbook from the voyage is in the Long Island Room of the East Hampton Library in East Hampton (village), New York. ==Death== Cooper died in Barranquilla, Colombia, South America. His date of death is sometimes reported as March 23, 1872, or April 24, 1872. ==Notes== ==References== Category:1803 births Category:1872 deaths Category:Southampton (village), New York Category:People from Sag Harbor, New York Category:Explorers of Antarctica Category:American people in whaling Category:1845 in Japan Category:Sea captains Category:People from Southampton (town), New York ","title":"Mercator Cooper"},{"id":"9067658","text":"Jim Provenzano (born December 6, 1961) is an American author, playwright, photographer and currently an editor with the Bay Area Reporter. ==Life and work== Born in Queens, New York, Provenzano was raised in Ashland, Ohio and attended Kent State University from 1979–80 as a theater major, a summer internship at Porthouse Theatre in Akron, where he performed the title role in a 1980 production of The Who's musical Tommy. After transferring to Ohio State University in 1981, he graduated with a bachelor of fine arts in dance in 1985. While a student, he created stage works and video adaptations of dances, performed in works by fellow students and guest teachers Mark Taylor, Stephen Koester, Terry Creach. He received summer scholarships from the Dayton Ballet and Bill Evans Dance Company at Allegheny College. In 1985-1986 he lived in Pittsburgh and worked and toured with the Pittsburgh Dance Alloy. He also directed two Sam Shepard plays, Cowboy Mouth and Action as well as original performance works, in his rented expansive loft with theater seats. After moving to New York City in 1986, he performed with various modern dance choreographers, including Steve Gross and Bill Cratty, touring with Cratty's company for a year, and at The Yard on Martha's Vineyard in 1987. Provenzano created his own dance, music and performance works from 1987–92 in New York and performed at Franklin Furnace, P.S. 122, Dance Theatre Workshop Highways in Los Angeles and several other venues. In 1988, he directed, a New Jersey production of As Is. With a fellowship in Interdisciplinary Arts, he wrote, composed and designed the musical, Under the River, set in the World Trade Center's PATH station. It played at the Ohio Theatre in September 1998, produced with Theatre Tweed. In 1989 he began working as the publisher's assistant for OutWeek magazine and also contributed his first news and arts stories for editors Michelango Signorile, Sarah Pettit, and Gabriel Rotello. In 1990, he became the editor of the publication's offshoot Hunt, an entertainment weekly, before both publications folded in July 1991. Many of his former coworkers, including Dale Peck, Troy Masters and Walter Armstrong went on to continue publishing journalism and novels. During that time, he was also a member of both ACT UP and Queer Nation, participating in protests for both organizations. He also wrote freelance arts features for Frontiers, The Advocate, High Performance and San Francisco Sentinel, including interviews with Clive Barker, Chita Rivera, and Paul Bartel. Provenzano moved to San Francisco after visiting in 1992, when he was offered a position as an assistant editor for the Bay Area Reporter. He completed a language certificate at Florence's Scuola Leonardo da Vinci in 1995. In 1997, Provenzano completed a master of arts degree in English/creative writing at San Francisco State University. In 1996 then-Bay Area Reporter editor Mike Salinas asked him to write a sports column to cover the LGBT athletics community. Among the publication's first sports writers was Gay Games cofounder Tom Waddell. Sports Complex was published weekly until 2006. The column was internationally syndicated from 2004–06. Among the topics covered were the controversies of the California AIDSRide, financial controversies and accomplishments of the Gay Games and Outgames, as well as interviews with, and articles about, gay and lesbian athletes, including Esera Tuaolo, Jerry Smith, Glenn Burke, David Kopay, Billie Jean King, Greg Louganis, and several gay and lesbian Olympic athletes. Provenzano has frequently been interviewed in print, television, radio and films for his expertise on the LGBT athletics movement. Provenzano is also the author of six novels, most notably PINS (1999) about gay high school wrestlers. The book was included in more than a dozen college reading lists, and remained among the top ten bestselling gay fiction in 2000. Provenzano often trained, competed and medalled with the Golden Gate Wrestling Club from 1992 to 2006. He also competed and medalled in track and field events with the San Francisco Track & Field Club from 2003-2006. After being commissioned to adapt PINS to the stage, the work premiered at New Conservatory Theatre Center, running from August through September 2002. A Chicago staging took place in 2006. In 2003, Provenzano published Monkey Suits, about gay cater-waiters in 1980s Manhattan, and Cyclizen (2007) about a gay bicycle messenger in 1990s New York City, which both fictionalize his experiences in AIDS activism. Nearly two dozen anthologies published from 1998 to 2007 include his short stories and essays. In 2005, Provenzano was asked to guest-curate the world's first gay sports exhibit, Sporting Life: GLBT Athletics and Cultural Change from the 1960s to Today for the GLBT Historical Society in San Francisco. The exhibit displayed hundreds of items from more than 40 teams, and was extended through 2006. Provenzano returned as an Editor with the Bay Area Reporter in September 2006. In May, 2010, he co-created and became editor of BARtab, the Reporters (initially monthly, now weekly) LGBT nightlife guide. In March 2020, he was promoted to Culture Editor at the Bay Area Reporter. In December 2011, he published his fourth novel, Every Time I Think of You, about two gay teenage athletes in the 1970s, one of whom becomes a paraplegic. The novel won a Lambda Literary Award in 2012. March 20, 2014, he published Message of Love, the sequel to Every Time I Think of You, where in Philadelphia, the lead characters Reid and Everett go through their early 1980s college years at both Temple University and University of Pennsylvania as the AIDS epidemic approaches. The novel was selected as a Lambda Literary Award finalist in 2015. In May, 2016, he published Forty Wild Crushes; stories. In 2018, he contracted with Beautiful Dreamer Press to publish his sixth novel, Now I'm Here, with a September 2018 publication. Set mostly in rural Ohio in the 1970s and 1980s, it focuses on the lives of a gay piano prodigy and the son of a pumpkin farmer. In June 2020, he published audiobook adaptations of his novels Every Time I Think of You and Message of Love with narrator Michael Wetherbee. Provenzano is openly gay. He currently lives in San Francisco. ==Works Fiction=== * PINS (1999) * Wrestling Team (German translation of PINS, 2003) * Monkey Suits (2003) * Cyclizen (2007) * Every Time I Think of You (2011) * PINS; audiobook adaptation (2013) * Message of Love (2014) * Forty Wild Crushes: stories (2016) * Now I'm Here (2018) * Every Time I Think of You; audiobook adaptation (2020) * Message of Love; audiobook adaptation (2020) ===Plays=== * PINS (2002, adapted from his novel) * Bootless Cries (1998) * Under the River (1988) ===Honors=== * Lambda Literary Award finalist (Gay Romance) 2015, for the novel Message of Love * Lambda Literary Award (Gay Romance) 2012, for the novel Every Time I Think of You * Legacy Award in Journalism, Federation of Gay Games (2007) * 100 Champions Award, Gay Games Chicago, (2006) * Bay Area Theatre Critics Award, PINS (2002) * Fellowship, Interdisciplinary Arts, New Jersey Arts Council (1988) ===Further reading=== * \\"Jim Provenzano: Muscle Memory\\", Lambda Literary Review July 24, 2012 * \\"Sports, Sex and Paraplegia\\", Dan Woog, The Outfield, February 2012 * Author Interview, Windy City Times May 16, 2012 * Lambda Literary Review essay on Romance novels, Lambda Literary Review March 2012 * \\"Audible Art: How to Make an Audio Book\\", Earl August 9, 2013 * Video Feature, Gay People's Chronicle October 26, 2012 * \\"Exhibit Shows How Gays Have Shaped Sports\\", San Francisco Chronicle April 2, 2005 * Gay Games VI Sydney photojournalism, 'Sports Complex column, Bay Area Reporter August–December 2002 * Wrestling with Sexuality, The Advocate, Dec. 21, 1999 ==References== * Amazon.com listing * summary of reviews of the PINS stage adaptation produced in Chicago, June 2006, various publications] * * Internet Book Database listing ==External links== * www.jimprovenzano.com, Official Site * Author Blog * Facebook Author Page * Cyclizen blog; archive * SportsComplex.org; archive * Sporting Life exhibit archive Category:1961 births Category:Living people Category:Gay writers Category:LGBT writers from the United States Category:People from San Francisco Category:LGBT journalists from the United States Category:Lambda Literary Award winners Category:Journalists from California Category:Journalists from New York City ","title":"Jim Provenzano"},{"id":"9067664","text":"When I Live by the Garden and the Sea is an EP from the Portland, Oregon based, ambient musician Matthew Cooper, under the name Eluvium.

United States, 495 U.S. 575 (1990), was a U.S. Supreme Court decision that filled in an important gap in the federal criminal law of sentencing. The federal criminal code does not contain a definition of many crimes, including burglary, the crime at issue in this case. Yet sentencing enhancements applicable to federal crimes allow for the enhancement of a defendant's sentence if he has been convicted of prior felonies. The Court addressed in this case how \\"burglary\\" should be defined for purposes of such sentencing enhancements when the federal criminal code contained no definition of \\"burglary.\\"Taylor v. United States, . The approach the Court adopted in this case has guided the lower federal courts in interpreting other provisions of the criminal code that also refer to generic crimes not otherwise defined in federal law. ==Facts== Taylor pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri, in violation of (g). At the time, Taylor had four prior convictions—one for robbery, one for assault, and two were for second-degree burglary under Missouri law. The government sought the sentence enhancement under the Armed Career Criminal Act, codified in (e): (1) In the case of a person who violates section 922(g)... and has three previous convictions by any court... for a violent felony or a serious drug offense, or both... such person shall be fined not more than $25,000 and imprisoned not less than fifteen years. (2) As used in this subsection — :(B) the term \\"violent felony\\" means any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year that — ::(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or ::(ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another. Taylor conceded that his prior assault and arson convictions qualified for the § 924(e) sentencing enhancement, but disputed that his two burglary convictions qualified for the enhancement, because they did not present a serious risk of physical injury to another. The district court rejected this argument, and sentenced Taylor to 15 years without parole. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed the sentence. It ruled that \\"burglary\\" \\"means burglary however a state chooses to define it,\\" the district court properly counted both of Taylor's Missouri burglary convictions under the § 924(e) sentence enhancement. The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to review the case so that it could resolve a conflict among the federal courts of appeals about how \\"burglary\\" should be defined under § 924(e). ==Opinion of the Court== The Court had to answer how to define \\"burglary\\" in § 924(e). It had no \\"single accepted meaning\\" in the laws of the states, and the text of the statute does not suggest a particular meaning. Should it therefore mean whatever the state of the defendant's prior conviction defines \\"burglary\\" to be? Should it instead have a more uniform definition? And if so, what should the source of that more uniform definition be? The Court examined the progress of the bill that became § 924(e) as it wound its way through Congress. Throughout the legislative process, Congress consistently focused on \\"career offenders\\" -- \\"those who commit a large number of fairly serious crimes as their means of livelihood and who, because they possess weapons, present at least a potential threat of harm to persons.\\" Congress likewise singled out burglary because of the potential for harm that crime entails as compared to simple larceny or automobile crimes. Unlawful entry into a building always presents the danger of a confrontation, and if the intruder is likely to be armed, that confrontation becomes that much more dangerous. In earlier versions of the bill, Congress had specifically defined \\"burglary,\\" thus suggesting that Congress had intended to take a \\"categorical approach\\" to defining burglary despite leaving the term undefined in the final version of the bill. Furthermore, the legislative history suggested that Congress intended that categorical approach to encompass a \\"generic\\" view of burglary, \\"roughly corresponding to the definitions of burglary in a majority of the States' criminal codes.\\" In this way, Congress could avoid leaving the precise contours to the vagaries of varying definitions and labels crafted by other jurisdictions. In light of these concerns, the Court rejected the Eighth Circuit's approach, which relegated the definition to state law. Because of differences in state laws, \\"a person imprudent enough to shoplift or steal from an automobile in California would be found, under the Ninth Circuit's view, to have committed a burglary constituting a \\"violent felony\\" for enhancement purposes -- yet a person who did so in Michigan might not.\\" Not seeing a clear indication that Congress intended for this to be the case, the Court reasoned that \\"odd results of this kind\\" should not result from interpreting § 924(e). The Court next considered whether it should read the word \\"burglary\\" in § 924(e) as the common law did. This approach had some appeal; after all, all states' definitions of \\"burglary\\" included the common- law definition of burglary -- breaking and entering of a dwelling at night with the intent to commit a felony once inside. But the difficulty with this approach was that modern definitions have strayed far from the common-law definition. For instance, most states allow entry without \\"breaking,\\" allow burglary to occur during the daytime, and require no felonious intent once inside. \\"The arcane distinctions embedded in the common-law definition have little relevance to modern law enforcement concerns.\\" Conversely, few acts that fall under the modern definition of \\"burglary\\" would also count as burglary under the common law. And although the Court sometimes applied the maxim that undefined statutory terms would carry the common-law definition, it reasoned that that maxim would not apply where the common-law definition was outmoded. For these reasons, the Court rejected the idea of reading § 924(e)'s definition of \\"burglary\\" as the common-law definition. Before the Court, Taylor proposed a definition that defined \\"burglary\\" to include only \\"entering a building of another with the intent to commit a crime that has as an element conduct that presents a serious risk of physical injury to another.\\" The Court rejected this idea because it was not supported by the language of the statute. The statute says, \\"any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year that is burglary.\\" This suggested that Congress intended to include the entire scope of \\"burglary,\\" not just some subset, as a predicate offense. \\"This choice of language indicates that Congress thought ordinary burglaries, as well as burglaries involving some element making them especially dangerous, presented a sufficiently 'serious potential risk' to count toward enhancement.\\" This left a \\"generic\\" meaning of the word \\"burglary\\" -- an unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or other structure, with intent to commit a crime. If the defendant's prior conviction involves a crime with these basic elements, regardless of the label, it counts as a predicate offense under § 924(e). The final step in the Court's analysis was to settle the question of how to prove whether a particular defendant's conviction qualifies as \\"generic burglary.\\" If the state statute is narrower, then \\"there is no problem, because the conviction necessarily implies that the defendant has been found guilty of all the elements of generic burglary.\\" If the state's definition of \\"burglary\\" matches the definition of \\"generic burglary,\\" or varies from it only slightly, then that too is sufficient. However, where a state's definition of burglary is broader than the definition of \\"generic burglary,\\" or where a state does not have a crime called \\"burglary,\\" the problem of proving whether the conviction is for \\"generic burglary\\" is more difficult. The statute says \\"has three prior convictions,\\" not \\"has thrice committed acts which.\\" This suggests that it is the elements of the conviction rather than the facts supporting it that matters. In appropriate cases, the trial court may look past the statute of conviction to the indictment or information and the jury instructions to determine whether, with respect to any one of the defendant's prior convictions, he was convicted of a crime whose elements match the elements of \\"generic burglary.\\" ===Justice Scalia's concurrence=== Justice Scalia concurred in the opinion of the Court, except for its discussion of the legislative history -- the form the law took when it was a bill pending before Congress, and the statements various members of Congress made while it was pending. Justice Scalia believed that the text of the statute passed by Congress was the only thing that was important. \\"The examination [of the legislative history] does not uncover anything useful (i.e., anything that tempts us to alter the meaning we deduce from the text anyway), but that is the usual consequence of these inquiries (and a good thing, too).\\" Ultimately, though, Justice Scalia found the effort futile. \\"I can discern no reason for devoting 10 pages of today's opinion to legislative history, except to show that we have given this case close and careful consideration. We must find some better way of demonstrating our conscientiousness.\\" ==See also== * List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 495 * List of United States Supreme Court cases * Lists of United States Supreme Court cases by volume * List of United States Supreme Court cases by the Rehnquist Court ==References== ==External links== * Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States sentencing case law Category:1990 in United States case law Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Rehnquist Court Category:Armed Career Criminal Act case law ","title":"Taylor v.

They plant many kinds of vegetables. But when the crops are ripe, a rooster sells tickets to other chickens who make a self-servicing cafe out of the field. Porky notices and tries to chase them off, but they persist. He tries everything to get the chicken to leave from a scarecrow to sending his dog Streamline but to no avail.

It is located in the western suburbs of Gladstone, about from the town's centre, off Aerodrome Road. The airport is owned and operated by the Gladstone Regional Council which took control of it by operation of the Local Government Reform when the Gladstone-Calliope Aerodrome Board was dissolved on 15 March 2007.Local Government Reform Implementation Regulation 2008 (Qld) The main supplier of scheduled passenger air services is QantasLink, a subsidiary of Qantas, with most services non-stop to, or from Brisbane Airport. Virgin Australia commenced services to Brisbane 17 October 2011. They further announced at the launch of flights that a third-daily service would be added to the route from 16 January 2011. This has further been increased to six week-daily services since early 2013 mostly on ATR 72 aircraft with the Embraer 190 and the Boeing 737-800 also making regular appearances in the schedule. As of the 17th of July 2017 Alliance airlines has started to make 34 jet services between Gladstone and Brisbane. As of March 2008, QantasLink was scheduled to operate about 38 return services per week (i.e. about 76 aircraft movements) between Gladstone and Brisbane using Dash 8 aircraft with seating from 50 to 74 passengers. In addition, a small number of flights operate northwards to Rockhampton, Mackay, Townsville and Cairns. The Gladstone Regional Council commenced an upgrade of the airport in 2008. The council announced that the airport would not shut down during the upgrade. In 2011 the late and liquidated Air Australia known as Strategic Airlines at the time began regular flights from Brisbane Airport and back with their Airbus A320 fleet; this only lasted around 4–5 months before ceasing operations to Gladstone due to the low amount of passengers on each flight causing the airline to lose money. In 2017 Cobham Aviation Services Australia Boeing 717 fleet began ceasing daily flights to the regional town due to higher demands in longer domestic route and also due to passenger numbers reducing after the mining boom from 2012-2016, because this Sunstate Airlines and Qantaslink had to increase operations to Gladstone to 6 daily flights. After this Cobham only flew in to fill in for any Q400 flights that had issues. Though rumour have it that they might be making a few returns during 2019 due to an increased number of jobs becoming available in the mining industry. == Facilities == The airport resides at an elevation of above sea level. It has 4 parking stands using a state of the art double level parking bay design, able to hold from Q200s to 737s, it also has a large GA parking areas to the west of the main terminal. It has one runway designated 10/28 with an asphalt surface measuring , able to hold up to a Boeing 737 or an Airbus A320. == Airlines and destinations == == Ground transport == Buses operate between the town centre and the airport, but are only operational from Monday to Friday between 6am and 6pm. Taxis are also available, as are rental cars. == Statistics == Gladstone Airport was ranked 27th in Australia for the number of revenue passengers served in financial yearFiscal year 1 July - 30 June 2010-2011.

He was also a presenter on Brisbane radio station 4BC as the \\"Gardening Guru\\" of weekend mornings, in which he answered a wide range of questions from callers. Campbell began his radio career in 1983, television in 1985 and newspaper in 1991. ==Early life== Campbell was born in New Zealand in 1933. His post school years involved a number of different jobs: grocer's assistant in a small country town in New Zealand, sales representative, stock and station agent, and auctioneer. Eventually employed by a fertiliser company, he gained experience with plants through his time spent conducting fertiliser trials and involvement with farmers' meetings. Throughout this period he studied as a mature student at Lincoln College, then part of the University of Canterbury, receiving a Diploma in Horticulture. Subsequent studies included a Certificate in Journalism, a Diploma in sales management, and experience gained from a public speaking course. ==\\"Gardening Australia\\"== A longtime presenter of Queensland-specific plants and their gardening techniques, Colin Campbell was a most popular Gardening Australia celebrity. Colin typically reported on topics such as growing Anthuriums, heliconias, cordylines, grevilleas, and drought resistant plants,Examples of drought-resistant plants used a friendly and humorous style of presentation. Common questions usually involved worries about 'yellowing leaves' (Nitrogen deficiency) or 'funny white fluffy stuff' (mealybug). Colin's patience, humour, and down to earth explanations made his show very popular as its longevity shows; it had a loyal following in Southeast Queensland. He also regularly contributed to Brisbane printed media. Colin was a great advocate of gardeners' rights. Although this may seem ambiguous, there was a feeling amongst many gardeners in Australia that they are being wrongly targeted as the culprits behind Southeast Queensland's (and wider Australia's) water shortage problems. Colin was advocating the health benefits that gardening has to offer people of all ages, especially the elderly, and that there are \\"water wise\\"\\" ways to garden. Colin in particular took it upon himself to stand up for gardeners. His goal was to show the inequities of blaming gardeners for water shortages whilst allowing other members of society such as some irresponsible members of the industrial and commercial sectors to get away with their continued abuses of the system. These views were expressed in many of his presentations and speeches and for this he was very popular with thousands of gardeners who feel vilified. ==Awards and Accolades== * 1991 and 2002: Nursery and Garden Industry Association Certificate of Recognition for service to the Nursery Industry. * 1994: Appointed a Fellow of the Australian Institute of Horticulture. * 2004: Minister for Primary Industries Award for Continued Outstanding Service to an Industry Sector. * 2006: Meritorious Achievement Award for outstanding service and support to the Queensland Nursery Industry * 2006: Inducted into Hall of Fame by Landscape Queensland Inc, formerly Queensland Association of Landscape Industries. * 2007: Awarded the Order of Australia Medal (OAM) for service to horticulture, particularly as a contributor to a range of gardening related television and radio programmes and publications. * Varieties of hibiscus, daylily and clivia have been named in his honour. * Patron of the Hibiscus Society of Queensland, the Queensland Herb Society, the Brisbane Daylily Society, the International Tropical Foliage and Garden Society, the Buderim Garden Club * Member of the Maleny Garden Club and the Royal Horticultural Society (Queensland). * Nominee for Queenslander of the Year and Australian of the Year. ==The Brisbane Agricultural Exhibition== Colin attended the Brisbane Agricultural Exhibition (Ekka) every year as he presented from 4BC's booth in the Gardening Exhibition area.

In 1815, Roman graduated from St. Mary College in Baltimore, Maryland. The following year he married Aimée Françoise Parent. The couple would have eight children. \\"A.B.\\" was a member of an aristocratic French Creole family, who first immigrated from Grenoble, France to La Louisiane (today's Louisiana, USA), in 1741.http://www.oakalleyplantation.com/learn-explore/history In 1818, Roman was elected to the Louisiana House of Representatives at the age of 23, and he was elected Speaker of the House in 1822, serving until 1826. He was elected Parish Judge in St. James Parish, in 1826. He was again elected to the Louisiana House and was Speaker during the constitutional crisis following the death of Governor Pierre Derbigny in 1828. In 1830, Roman was elected governor as a Whig candidate. At various points in the race his opponents include the flamboyant Bernard de Marigny, Martin Duralde, son-in-law of Henry Clay and relation of Governor William C.C. Claiborne, and former Governors Jacques Villeré (who died in March before the election) and Armand Beauvais, who resigned his position of Acting Governor to run. Results of the 1830 special gubernatorial election: André Roman 3,638; W. S. Hamilton 2,701; Armand Beauvais 1,478; David Randall 463 ==First term as Governor== On January 31, 1831, Governor Roman took his oath of office during a time of storms, floods, economic depression, and epidemics. During these years of vigorous economic growth, yellow fever killed over 5,000 Louisianans, the number of banks in the state rose from 5 to 11, the Canal Bank built the New Basin Canal and the Pontchartrain Railroad began locomotive service in 1832. Governor Roman is credited with establishing the state penitentiary system. The College of Jefferson opened in St. James Parish, and the College of Franklin opened in St. Landry Parish. The Louisiana Agricultural Society was organized with Governor Roman as its first president. The South Carolina nullification controversy moved Roman and most of Louisiana to back President Andrew Jackson's stand on national authority over state nullification. The old Charity Hospital building on Canal Street was used as the State House, while 611 Royal Street was the official residence of the governor after the state government returned from Donaldsonville. When his term was ending, Governor Roman sought re-election, but he was defeated by Edward Douglass White Sr., another Whig. In 1836, Roman opted to run for the United States Senate, but he was defeated by Alexandre Mouton. In 1838, Roman again sought election as governor. His opponent this time was Denis Prieur, the Jacksonian Mayor of New Orleans who lived openly with his quadroon mistress. Roman beat Prieur 7,590 votes to 6,782. ==Second term== On February 4, 1839, Roman resumed the governor's office stressing education and civic improvements. During this administration the first practical impetus on a public education system was established: 600 volumes of Charles Gayarré's Historical Essay on Louisiana were purchased and distributed among the Parish schools. Appropriations allowed copying of parish archives on Louisiana colonial history. Roman created the Office of State Engineer and advocated opening the passes at the mouth of the Mississippi River for better shipping. Governor Roman served as the President of the New Orleans Drainage Company which drained the swamps behind the city. The Clinton and Port Hudson Railroad, which aided the cotton industry, was established, as well as an experimental farm in St. James Parish. During Governor Roman's second term, the state abolished imprisonment for debt. With economic crises and panics looming, Roman struggled to maintain calm. He vetoed several new bank charters during the most volatile economic period in antebellum Louisiana (1841–42). The Bank Act of 1842 replaced the earlier easy credit system with a sounder, more restrictive policy. ==Private citizen== Photo of André B. Roman around 1860 from the Brady-Handy Photograph Collection (Library of Congress) After his second term in office, Governor Roman returned to his St. James Parish home but remained politically active. In 1845, he was elected Delegate to the state constitutional convention and in 1848, Roman went to Europe as an agent for Citizens Bank and Consolidated Association of Planters for an extensions of bonds. He was again elected Delegate to the state constitutional convention of 1852. In 1861, with the Civil War looming, Roman as a delegate to the Louisiana Secession convention opposed secession. The Convention chose secession and Governor Roman was selected along with John Forsyth and Martin J. Crawford to negotiate a peaceable separation from the United States, but United States Secretary of State William H. Seward refused to meet with them. During the war Roman lost all his wealth and property. On January 26, 1866, Roman died while walking down Dumaine Street. He had just accepted an appointment to the office of City Recorder of Deeds and Mortgages from Governor James Madison Wells. ==References== ==Sources== * State of Louisiana - Biography *Encyclopedia Louisiana ==External links== *National Governors Association *Cemetery Memorial by La-Cemeteries Category:Members of the Louisiana House of Representatives Category:Speakers of the Louisiana House of Representatives Category:1795 births Category:1866 deaths Category:Governors of Louisiana Category:Louisiana Creole people Category:Louisiana Whigs Category:Whig Party state governors of the United States Category:19th-century American politicians ","title":"Andre B.

The massacre was carried out from July 15 to July 20, 1997, by the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC), an outlawed right-wing paramilitary group. On July 12, 1997, two planeloads of paramilitaries arrived at the airport of San José del Guaviare, which also served as a base for anti-narcotics police. The paramilitaries then traveled through territories where the Colombian National Army manned checkpoints. On July 15, 1997, the paramilitaries arrived at Mapiripán. They used chainsaws and machetes to murder, behead, dismember, and disembowel a number of civilians. Because the bodies were thrown into a river, it is unknown exactly how many people died but the U.S. State Department claimed in 2003 that at least 30 civilians were killed.National Security Archive, August 1, 2003, Robert P.

This may be Earth's sixth major extinction, often called the Anthropocene or Holocene extinction. ==Latest consensus on projections== The scientific consensus in the 2014 IPCC Fifth Assessment Report is that: == Extinction risks reported  2004 === In one study published in Nature in 2004, between 15 and 37% of 1103 endemic or near- endemic known plant and animal species will be \\"committed to extinction\\" by 2050. More properly, changes in habitat by 2050 will put them outside the survival range for the inhabitants, thus committing the species to extinction. Other researchers, such as Thuiller et al., Araújo et al., Person et al., Buckley and Roughgarden, and Harte et al. have raised concern regarding uncertainty in Thomas et al.s projections; some of these studies believe it is an overestimate, others believe the risk could be greater. Thomas et al. replied in Nature addressing criticisms and concluding \\"Although further investigation is needed into each of these areas, it is unlikely to result in substantially reduced estimates of extinction. Anthropogenic climate change seems set to generate very large numbers of species-level extinctions.\\" On the other hand, Daniel Botkin et al. state \\"... global estimates of extinctions due to climate change (Thomas et al. 2004) may have greatly overestimated the probability of extinction...\\" Mechanistic studies are documenting extinctions due to recent climate change: McLaughlin et al. documented two populations of Bay checkerspot butterfly being threatened by precipitation change. Parmesan states, \\"Few studies have been conducted at a scale that encompasses an entire species\\" and McLaughlin et al. agreed \\"few mechanistic studies have linked extinctions to recent climate change.\\" === 2008 === In 2008, the white lemuroid possum was reported to be the first known mammal species to be driven extinct by climate change. However, these reports were based on a misunderstanding. One population of these possums in the mountain forests of North Queensland is severely threatened by climate change as the animals cannot survive extended temperatures over 30 °C. However, another population 100 kilometres south remains in good health. === 2010 === The risk of extinction does need to lead to a demonstrable extinction process to validate future extinctions attributable to climate change. In a study led by Barry Sinervo Sinervo B., F. R. Méndez-de-la-Cruz, D. B. Miles, et al. 2010. Erosion of lizard diversity by climate change and altered thermal niches. Science, 324:894-899., a mathematical-biologist at the University of California Santa Cruz, researchers analyzed observed contemporary extinctions (since dramatic modern climate warming began in 1975). Results of the study indicate that climate-forced extinctions of lizard families of the world have already started. The model is premised on the ecophysiological limits of an organism being exceeded. In the case of lizards, this occurs when their preferred body temperature is exceeded in their local environment. Lizards are ectotherms that regulate body temperature using heat sources of their local environment (the sun, warm air temperatures, or warm rocks). Surveys of 200 sites in Mexico showed 24 local extinctions (= extirpations), of Sceloporus lizards. Using a model developed from these observed extinctions the researchers surveyed other extinctions around the world and found that the model predicted those observed extirpations, thus attributing the extirpations around the world to climate warming. These models predict that extinctions of the lizard species around the world will reach 20% by 2080, but up to 40% extinctions in tropical ecosystems where the lizards are closer to their ecophysiological limits than lizards in the temperate zone Huey, R. B., Deutsch, C. A., Tewksbury, J. J., Vitt, L. J., Hertz, P. E., Álvarez Pérez, H. J., & Garland Jr, T. (2009). Why tropical forest lizards are vulnerable to climate warming. Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 276(1664), 1939-1948.. === 2012 === According to research published in the January 4, 2012 Proceedings of the Royal Society B current climate models may be flawed because they overlook two important factors: the differences in how quickly species relocate and competition among species. According to the researchers, led by Mark C. Urban, an ecologist at the University of Connecticut, diversity decreased when they took these factors into account, and that new communities of organisms, which do not exist today, emerged. As a result, the rate of extinctions may be higher than previously projected. === 2014 === According to research published in the 30 May 2014 issue of Science, most known species have small ranges, and the numbers of small-ranged species are increasing quickly. They are geographically concentrated and are disproportionately likely to be threatened or already extinct. According to the research, current rates of extinction are three orders of magnitude higher than the background extinction rate, and future rates, which depend on many factors, are poised to increase. Although there has been rapid progress in developing protected areas, such efforts are not ecologically representative, nor do they optimally protect biodiversity. In the researchers' view, human activity tends to destroy critical habitats where species live, warms the planet, and tends to move species around the planet to places where they don't belong and where they can come into conflict with human needs (e.g. causing species to become pests). === 2016 === In 2016 the Bramble Cay melomys, which lived on a Great Barrier Reef island, was reported to probably be the first mammal to become extinct because of sea level rises due to human-made climate change. Extinction risks of the Adelie penguin are being reported because of climate change. The Adelie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) species is declining and data analysis done on the breeding colonies is used to estimate and project future habitat and population sustainability in relation to warming sea temperatures. By 2060, one-third of the observed Adelie penguin colony along the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) will be in decline. The Adelie penguins are a circumpolar species, used to the ranges of Antarctic climate, and experiencing population decline. Climate model projections predict sanctuary for the species past 2099. The observed population is similarly proportional to the species-wide population (one-third of the observed population is equal to 20% of the species-wide population). Sex ratios for sea turtles in the Caribbean are being affected because of climate change. Environmental data were collected from the annual rainfall and tide temperatures over the course of 200 years and showed an increase in air temperature (mean of 31.0 degree Celsius). These data were used to relate the decline of the sex ratios of sea turtles in the North East Caribbean and climate change. The species of sea turtles include Dermochelys coriacea, Chelonia myads, and Eretmochelys imbricata. Extinction is a risk for these species as the sex ratio is being afflicted causing a higher female to male ratio. Projections estimate the declining rate of male Chelonia myads as 2.4% hatchlings being male by 2030 and 0.4% by 2090. ===2019=== According to the World Wildlife Fund, the jaguar is already \\"near threatened\\" and the loss of food supplies and habitat due to the fires make the situation more critical. The fires affect water chemistry (such as decreasing the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water), temperature, and erosion rates, which in turn affects fish and mammals that depend on fish, such as the giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis). ===2020=== The unprecedented fires of the 2019–20 Australian bushfire season that have swept through 18 million acres (7 million hectares) have claimed 29 human lives and have stressed Australia's wildlife. Before the fires, only 500 tiny Kangaroo Island dunnarts (Sminthopsis aitkeni) lived on one island; after half the island was burned, it is possible only one has survived. Bramble Cay melomys (Melomys rubicola) became the first known casualty of human-caused climate change in 2015 due to rising sea levels and repeated storm surges; the greater stick- nest rat (Leporillus conditor) may be next. Emus (Dromaius novaehollandiae) are not in danger of extinction, although they might be wiped out in Australia. The loss of 8,000 koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus) in NSW alone broke hearts around the world, but the animals are endangered but not functionally extinct. A February 2020 study published by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America found that one-third of all plant and animal species could be extinct by 2070 as a result of climate change. == See also == * Atelopus varius * Chytridiomycosis * Ecosystem services * Gastric-brooding frog * Golden toad * Guajira stubfoot toad * Keystone species * Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum * Risks to civilization, humans, and planet Earth == References == == External links == * * * Category:Doomsday scenarios Category:Environmental conservation Climate change, Risk from ","title":"Extinction risk from climate change"},{"id":"9068309","text":"The 194th Armored Brigade is a separate brigade of the US Army. ==History== In 1962, the 194th Armored Brigade was created and assigned to the US Army's Combat Developments Command to test new materiel at Fort Ord, California.p.312 Wilson, John B.

Village belongs to the municipality Jankov. To the south lies the protected landscape area of Blanský Forest. The village was deserted after the Second World War, allowing its medieval plan and vernacular buildings in the South Bohemian Folk or Rural Baroque style to remain intact. It was restored and repopulated from 1990, and it was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1998. ==History== Holašovice is first mentioned in 1263. In 1292, King Wenceslaus II gave the village and several others to the Cistercian monastery of Vyšší Brod. It remained the property of the monastery until 1848. left Between 1520 and 1525, Holašovice was nearly wiped out by the bubonic plague. Only two of its inhabitants survived. A column erected over the plague grave at the north end of the village commemorates this event. The monastery gradually repopulated the village with settlers from Bavaria and Austria. By 1530, the population had risen to 17, according to the monastery's records, and it had become a mainly German-speaking enclave within the Czech language area. By 1900, there were 163 inhabitants of German ethnic origin and 1 of Czech ethnic origin. After the displacement of German residents at the end of the Second World War, many farms in the village were deserted and fell into disrepair. Holašovice became a desolate and abandoned place under the Czech post-war Communist regime. From 1990, the village was lavishly restored and inhabited once more. It now has a population of around 140. ==Buildings== Holašovice is a typical Bohemian village for the Hlubocká Blatská area around České Budějovice. It consists of 23 brick farmyards containing 120 buildings, each with their gable end facing a central broad village green, with a fish pond and chapel. The buildings date from the 18th to 20th century, with most of them built in the second half of the 19th century. They are constructed in the South Bohemian Folk Baroque style. The chapel of St. John of Nepomuk in the village green was built in 1755. ==Gallery== File:Holašovice Historic Village-112776.jpgVillage with door File:Holašovice Historic Village-112757.jpgVillage with stream File:Holašovice Historic Village-112759.jpgVillage with tree File:Holašovice Historic Village-112761.jpgView of bell steeple File:Holašovice Historic Village-112755.jpgVillage with facades ==References== ==External links== *Pruvodce.com *Entry on the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites *Holasovice.eu *Virtual show Category:World Heritage Sites in the Czech Republic Category:Villages in České Budějovice District ","title":"Holašovice"},{"id":"9068391","text":"Jen Taylor Friedman is a soferet (Jewish ritual scribe). On September 9, 2007, she became the first woman known to have completed a Torah scroll. Taylor Friedman's sefer Torah was commissioned by United Hebrew Congregation, a Reform temple in St. Louis, Missouri. Taylor Friedman was born in Southampton, England, and educated at Oxford. While studying at Oxford, she became interested in halakha (Jewish law) and calligraphy, and by a \\"chance combination of happy circumstances\\" she met a sofer (a male scribe) who helped her realize that becoming a soferet would allow her to pursue both interests. Taylor Friedman continued her scribal studies in Jerusalem and New York City, where she now resides. Taylor Friedman's first project as a soferet was Megillat Esther, a scroll of the Biblical Book of Esther that is traditionally read in synagogue on the holiday of Purim.

The area north of the orange line was the Laurentide Ice Sheet. The Pembina Escarpment is a scarp that runs from South Dakota to Manitoba, and forms the western wall of the Red River Valley. The height of the escarpment above the river valley is . == Geology == The escarpment was originally formed by the undercutting of Cretaceous sandstones (the Dakota Formation) by the ancestral Red River. The escarpment was later steepened by glacial scouring. The escarpment is preserved due to a layer of erosion-resistant shale (the Pierre Formation) on top of the sandstone. The vista today, of wooded hills with small farms tucked into valleys (such as the Pembina Valley), is reminiscent of pastoral sections of New England. Streams flowing off the escarpment have high gradients and a cobble substrate. The final form of the escarpment as we know it today, was not created until the end of the last ice age around 12,000 years ago. During the ice age, much of North America was covered by the Laurentide Ice Sheet. As the ice sheet began to melt and recede, the meltwaters filled the ancestral Red River Valley to create Lake Agassiz. The valley walls, including the escarpment to the west, provided east and west boundaries for the lake, and remaining part of the ice sheet provided the northern boundary. During this period of time—known as the Lockhart Phase of Lake Agassiz—water flowed south from the lake into the Mississippi River and into the Gulf of Mexico. == Geography == In the US, the Pembina Escarpment is a Level 4 ecoregion, as defined by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The ecoregion covers , and is part of the Level 3 Northern Glaciated Plains ecoregion. In Canada, the Pembina Escarpment is considered to be an Ecodistrict within the Southwest Manitoba Uplands Ecoregion, and the Southwest Manitoba Uplands Ecoregion is part of the Prairies Ecozone. A Canadian Ecodistrict is equivalent to a US Level 4 Ecoregion and a Canadian Ecoregion is equivalent to a US Level 3 Ecoregion. A Canadian Ecozone is equivalent to a US Level 1 Ecoregion. Both the US and Canada consider Turtle Mountain to be a sibling ecodistrict with the Pembina Escarpment, as both countries place both areas within the same larger ecoregions. Some US sources use the term \\"Manitoba Escarpment\\" for the Canadian portion of the Pembina Escarpment, but in Canada, the term Manitoba Escarpment refers to a separate geographical region along the Saskatchewan- Manitoba border. The Pembina Escarpment is separated from the Manitoba Escarpment by the Assiniboine and Souris River valleys, which were covered by Lake Souris at the time of Lake Agassiz when both escarpments were formed. == Ecology == Before the Europeans settled in this region, the slopes and peaks of the escarpment were largely covered by a deciduous forest of burr oak and trembling aspen. The wetter, cooler, shadier slopes had more aspen, and the drier, warmer, sunnier slopes had more oak. The shrubbery along the slopes consisted of beaked hazel, high bush cranberry, saskatoon berry, and pin cherry. The areas along rivers and creeks with more moisture had Manitoba maple, green ash, red osier dogwood and willows. Native vegetation has largely been cleared to make way for agriculture, but still exists on steep slopes and near water where farming is difficult. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Landforms of Manitoba Category:Landforms of North Dakota Category:Landforms of South Dakota Category:Escarpments of the United States Category:Escarpments of Canada ","title":"Pembina Escarpment"},{"id":"9068424","text":"The Legend of Nigger Charley is a 1972 blaxploitation western film directed by Martin Goldman. The story of a trio of escaped slaves, it was released during the heyday of blaxploitation films. It was filmed in Charles City, Virginia and Eve's Ranch, Santa Fe, New Mexico. Other film locations included Jamaica and Arizona. The movie covers themes of racism, romance, and self- determination. The movie received backlash for its controversial title. The film stars Fred Williamson as Nigger Charley. The film is rated PG in the United States. It was followed by a 1973 sequel, The Soul of Nigger Charley. The film was renamed The Legend of Black Charley for broadcast television. ==Plot== The opening scene includes Charley as a baby with his mother Theo in Africa. The two are forced into slavery. Twenty years later, Charley kills an abusive plantation owner and flees with his two friends, Joshua and Toby. As they run away from the slave catchers, the trio experience racism, standoffs and romance, specifically in a small town. After Joshua is killed in a standoff against the town's outlaw, the film ends with Charley and Toby leaving the town to continue traveling with no destination. According to the reviewer in the New York Times, \\"For all the feverish activity, there has yet to be a film of rounded merit—one of skill, imagination and impact—about the black man and the Old West. Sadly, The Legend of Nigger Charley is fair. Fair only.\\" ==Cast== *Fred Williamson as Nigger Charley *D'Urville Martin as Toby *Don Pedro Colley as Joshua *Thomas Anderson as Shadow *Jerry Gatlin as Sheriff Rhinehart *Alan Gifford as Hill Carter *Will Hussung as Dr. Saunders *Gertrude Jeannette as Theo *Fred Lerner as Ollokot *Marcia McBroom as Leda *Bill Moor as Walker *Tricia O'Neil as Sarah Lyons *John Ryan as Houston *Doug Row as Dewey Lyons *Joe Santos as Reverend ==Background== This film was the debut movie for commercial director Martin Goldman. However, after many disagreements with the producer, Goldman distanced himself from the production. Larry Spangler, the producer, envisioned the film. To assure a degree of accuracy, he spent months researching that period during the 1800s. At first, Woody Strode was cast in the lead role but Strode changed his mind and dropped out. When Spangler continued the process of casting, he saw several top actors. However, he chose Williamson for \\"his right stature, the feel, the stamina, fervor, and virility of Nigger Charley ...\\" Fred Williamson at that point had never shot a gun or been on horse. He spent a total of one week working on both skills. Spangler wanted an authenticity to the setting. Thus, they filmed at an actual plantation, Shirley Plantation, in Virginia. Shirley Plantation was actually owned by the Carter family. This plantation is known for being the birth spot of General Robert E. Lee, the leader of the Confederate forces in the Civil War. ==Race and racism== When the film first advertised, the film promised black men fighting Indians. The advertisement and plot line caused a backlash from the Native Americans. They protested their depiction. Specifically, there is a scene in the film where Charley, Toby and Joshua run into a group of Native Americans. They approach the trio and begin to touch their skin trying to see whether the black color would rub off. This was extremely offensive to the Native American community and many chose to send letters. This is why the production was moved from Colombia to New Mexico. However, most of the controversy was centered on the title of the film. Some found the name so offensive that the newspapers actually edited the name in the advertisements to The Legend of Black Charley, or just Black Charley. Williamson said, \\"I called it Nigger Charley because it was controversy. The word nigger in the '70s was hot. Controversy is what sells.\\" He later explained that he believed the movie was helping to take back the meaning from the historical defamation. The movie helps reinforce the expected interaction between black and white people regarding the racial slur. White characters were chastised and punished for using the word while black people were free to use it flippantly. Throughout the film, they say it as a badge of honor, \\"signifying their willingness to defy the paralyzing constrictions of white society.\\" This paradigm is a reflection of what was occurring at the time regarding who was \\"allowed\\" to say the \\"N word.\\" In response to the controversy, Don Pedro Colley stated that racism is just a part of life and trying to cover up that point of history would be pointless. He also mentioned that he viewed the film as the black Indiana Jones and felt that the media was sensationalizing the film to be more controversial than the movie truly is. ==Film reviews== The film received rather negative reviews. From contemporary reviews, David McGillivray of the Monthly Film Bulletin reviewed a 95 minute version of the film. McGillivray stated that the film was \\"a routine amalgam of all the current 'black film' cliches\\" specifically noting the \\"blithely anarchronistic score sounds like a nightclub jam session, though it is also all of a piece with the film's grand disregard for authenticity.\\" McGillivray declared that \\"the scriptwriters seem hard put to find anything for their ox- like hero to do, and appear content to fill in the space between battles with monotonous and generally irrelveant dialogue exchanges between subsidiary characters.\\" The Philadelphia Tribune stated, \\"The Legend of Nigger Charley which opened at the Goldman Theater Wednesday, may not be the worst picture I've seen, but offhand I can't think of any that can top it.\\" The review goes on to explain how some of the atrocity of the film can be due to the genre it belongs to: Blaxploitation. This review said that this film and other Blaxploitation films insulted Black moviegoers' intelligence. The opening scene, described as \\"nonsensical,\\" is thought to be an empty shot at showing nudity rather than an accurate and insightful depiction of Africa. Furthermore, this reviewer didn't look kindly on the representation of the kind white plantation owner who freed Charley. The language in this review was patronizing and condescending to the image, \\"Then we jump to the story about Nigger Charley, a pre-Civil War slave who is freed by dear old massa on his deathbed thanks to the pleading of his kindly old momma.\\" Once again, the reviewer criticizes the exchange between another Charley and Leda as the inclusion of a pointless sex scene void of any plot significance. He considers the occasions of blood and gore for the sake of Black audience praise a cheap and insulting tactic. The humor was poor and the dialogue inane. Overall, Len Lear considered this film to be a terrible exploitation film. The Boston Globe also had malicious words for the film, calling it \\"a racist Western.\\" Although there are black characters in the film, the film remains cliché, he states. However, this reviewer affirmed the movie's values by stating that the meaning would be different if viewed as a black child. The movie offers a different hero to look up to for, at the time, there were only white cowboys to emulate during children's make-believe play. The film flips traditional tropes on their heads, as all of the black men are good and courageous in contrast to the white people of the film who are mostly detestable. As far as the acting goes, this reviewer stated that the actors either overacted or \\"walk woodenly through their roles.\\" ==See also== * List of films featuring slavery ==ReferencesCategory:1972 films Category:Blaxploitation films Category:African-American Western (genre) films Category:1970s action drama films Category:American action drama films Category:American films Category:Paramount Pictures films Category:Films about race and ethnicity Category:Films about American slavery Category:Obscenity controversies in film Category:1970s Western (genre) films Category:1972 drama films ","title":"The Legend of Nigger Charley"},{"id":"9068426","text":"William David Murdoch (10 February 18889 September 1942) was an Australian pianist, composer and author. ==Early life and education== Murdoch was born at Sandhurst (now Bendigo, Victoria), the son of Andrew Murdoch, an engineer, and his wife Annie, née Esler. At 11 years of age William began piano lessons and soon won several solo competitions. In 1903 he was awarded the first Bendigo Austral Scholarship. This entitled him to three years' tuition at the University of Melbourne Conservatorium of Music, where he continued his studies under William Adolphus Laver, later Ormond Professor of Music. In 1906 Murdoch won the (Sir William John) Clarke Scholarship, which entitled him to three years' tuition at the Royal College of Music, London. As the scholarship was not large enough to fully provide for the young man, it was agreed that he should receive the balance of his Austral Scholarship, and a further amount was raised from a concert and subscriptions at Bendigo. Murdoch spent four happy years at the London college and made great progress, under the guidance of Danish pianist and teacher, Frits Hartvigson. ==Career== Murdoch's first public recital at London towards the end of 1910 was very successful, and in 1912 he toured Australia with Louise Kirkby Lunn. He remained there in 1913 and toured with Dame Clara Butt and Kennerley Rumford. He was now a fine player with a sparkling technique, especially successful in his interpretation of the work of Chopin and Debussy. He toured the US and Canada during 1914, and for some time was with the band of the Grenadier Guards in France during the war. On 5 August 1915 Murdoch married Ellen Josephine Tuckfield in London. Murdoch gave recitals in Scandinavia in 1918 and in the following year began his long association with the violinist Albert Sammons, which developed into the formation of the \\"Chamber Music Players\\". These two with Lionel Tertis and Lauri Kennedy did some remarkable ensemble playing. In 1919 he participated in the premieres of Sir Edward Elgar's Violin Sonata in E minor and Piano Quintet in A minor. Murdoch's first wife, Ellen Josephine Tuckfield, died; he subsequently married divorcee Dorothy Violet Lang, née Mascall, on 21 March 1921, and after she divorced him, married Antonia Dorothea Meek, née Simon, on 25 November 1925. Murdoch contributed the article on \\"Pianoforte Music from 1880\\" to A Dictionary of Modern Music and Musicians, published in 1924, and in 1929 he again visited Australia and toured with Harold Williams. In 1933 Murdoch published a volume on Brahms, in which he analysed all his work for the piano, and in 1934 appeared Chopin: His Life, an interesting record which made use of much new material. He had intended to include a comprehensive study of Chopin's works in a later volume, but this had not appeared when Murdoch died at Holmbury St Mary, Surrey, on 9 September 1942. Murdoch left a widow, two sons and two daughters. ==Style== Murdoch's arrangements of organ works by Bach for the piano were very effective, and he also composed a number of songs and pieces for the piano. He was steeped in music from his childhood. When he first appeared he had a brilliant technique to which the years added the warmth of temperament and sensitiveness of thought, needed for the expression of a fine musician. He was especially renowned as one of the great ensemble players of his time. The critic William James Turner wrote in 1916: Even when we get to the best pianists it is rarely, if ever, that we find a combination of exceptional technical mastery with tone-power, delicacy of touch, brilliance, command of colour, sensitiveness of phrasing, variety of feeling, imagination and vital passion. Mr. Murdoch possesses all these qualities to a high degree (ADB). ==References== *J. A.

He came to prominence leading The Plugz, one of the earliest Los Angeles punk rock groups. Since the 1990s, his main musical outlet has been the Tito & Tarantula. ==Early life== Larriva was born in Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, and grew up in Fairbanks, Alaska, and El Paso, Texas. As a child he played the violin in the school orchestra and sang in the church and school choirs where he met his wife Janet Carroll. In 1972 Larriva snuck into Yale University for a full term without being noticed. After being kicked out of the Ivy League university, he moved to Mexico City and in 1975 moved to Los Angeles, California. He now lives in Austin, Texas, with his wife and daughter and continues to work in the music and film industries. ==Music careerThe Plugz=== Larriva was the vocalist and rhythm guitarist for punk band The Plugz. He formed The Plugz in Hollywood, California in 1978. Their presence during the birth of West Coast punk has ensured their enduring influence on punk bands. Record label Rhino recognized their role in the Los Angeles music scene by including their version of \\"La Bamba\\" on \\"We're Desperate: The L.A. Scene (1976-79).\\" The Plugz released two albums, Electrify Me (1978) and Better Luck (1981). The Plugz also scored the cult classic film Repo Man and contributed three songs to the soundtrack. ===Fatima Records=== In 1979 Larriva formed Fatima Records, a DIY record label, with Chicano printmaker Richard Duardo and music promoter Yolanda Ferrer to release the Plugz' single \\"Achin'\\"/\\"La Bamba.\\" The label would issue a few other releases, including the Plugz' second album Better Luck (1981) and \\"Attitudes\\" (1980), the debut EP by East Los Angeles punk band The Brat (produced by Larriva). Fatima Records was initially slated to release Fire of Love, the debut album by Los Angeles band The Gun Club; however, after Larriva produced six tracks, the label ran out of money, and Ruby Records completed the recordings and released the Gun Club's album. ===Cruzados=== In 1984 The Plugz evolved into the Cruzados. In 1985, they released a self-titled album on Arista Records. The second album After Dark released in 1987 featured new guitarist Marshall Rohner. The band broke up in 1990. Larriva and the Cruzados were both briefly featured in the film Road House, starring Patrick Swayze and Sam Elliott. ===Tito & Tarantula=== Tito & Tarantula began in 1992 when Larriva and lead guitarist Peter Atanasoff would perform in bars and cafes with friends every week. \\"We've always had an unspoken rule,\\" Larriva said to the Tucson Weekly in 1997, \\"and the rule is that everyone plays pretty much what they want. The band rarely rehearses.\\" Tarantula was featured on the soundtrack of Robert Rodriguez's movie Desperado which Larriva also scored. In 1996, Tito and Tarantula continue their relationship with Rodriguez, appearing in the film, soundtrack, and score, for From Dusk Till Dawn. Larriva, Atanasoff, and Johnny \\"Vatos\\" Hernandez are the band performing their song After Dark in the bar for Salma Hayek. In 1997, Tito & Tarantula released its long-awaited and highly acclaimed debut album Tarantism. They followed up with, Hungry Sally & Other Killer Lullabies in 1999, and Little Bitch in 2000. In 2002, the band was joined by Larriva's former Cruzados bandmate Steven Hufsteter. Later that year, they released Andalucia. Back Into The Darkness is their most recent release (2008). ===Psychotic Aztecs=== Tito Larriva, September 2007 Psychotic Aztecs, composed of Larriva on vocals, Oingo Boingo's rhythm section (John Avila on bass, Johnny \\"Vatos\\" Hernandez on drums) and Steven Hufsteter on guitar, began as a recording session for Grita! Records in Los Angeles and ended as the album Santa Sangre, released in 1999.Latinovision.com ==Film career== Larriva's first acting role was \\"Hammy\\" on The Pee-wee Herman Show in 1981. He has gone on to play notable supporting roles in big-budget films like Born in East L.A., Road House, Boys on the Side, Desperado, From Dusk Till Dawn and Once Upon a Time in Mexico. He often works with his friend, director Robert Rodriguez. His latest appearance was a few seconds cameo in Rodríguez' Machete trailer in Grindhouse. He also appears in the actual, released movie. He also played the character Ramon in the film True Stories (1986). Larriva performed the Talking Heads song, \\"Radio Head\\", and played the organ in the \\"Puzzling Evidence\\" scene.

Colombian policemen had been killed by youth gangs before the massacre took place, and the Colombian police were attempting to exact revenge against the gangs by carrying out the massacre. None of the victims of the massacre were gang members; they were all members of a Protestant Christian organization. ==Background== In the ongoing civil war in Colombia, many young people have been involved in street gangs and various militias. As a result, young people in Colombia claim to have been targeted by police regardless of whether they are actually involved in illicit activity. Human rights activists suggest that this targeting is retaliation for the killing of police officers. According to these activists, the Colombian drug cartels will offer a bounty for the murder of a police officer, and because young people living in poverty are assumed to be criminals, they are often targeted by police in retaliation for the actions of the cartels. ==Massacre== On November 15, 1992, around 9:00 PM, eight children and one adult, all members of a Christian youth group, were standing on a street corner in east Medellín. Three cars pulled up to the corner, and twelve men exited carrying weapons typical of the police. Seeing this, the young people began to pull out their identification cards, but the men ordered them to lie down on the ground. Once they were lying, the men opened fire on them. At one point the men debated sparing the life of eight- year-old Johana Mazo Ramírez, whose leg was in a cast, but one of their number killed her after arguing, \\"How can we leave them alive if they're the ones killing us.\\" Eight of the nine people attacked were killed, and the gunmen fled the scene after a patrol from the Colombian Army arrived. One victim was wounded and survived for a time before he succumbed too. The names and ages of the victims were Johana Mazo Ramírez (8), Johny Alexander Cardona Ramírez (17), Ricardo Alexander Hernández (17), Giovanny Alberto Vallejo Restrepo (15), Oscar Andrés Ortiz Toro (17), Ángel Alberto Barón Miranda (16), Marlon Alberto Álvarez (17), Nelson Duban Flórez Villa (17), and Mauricio Antonio Higuita Ramírez (22). ==Legacy== Before dying, the one victim who had been wounded and transferred to the hospital told his mother that one of the gunmen was a member of the Intelligence Division of the Colombian National Police, called F-2. Speculation following the massacre centered on a number of police officers who lived in the area, members of the F-2 and of the judicial police. Because the victims were either very young or activists, it was apparent that this was not a gang shooting. A number of theories about the motivation for the crime appeared in the weeks afterward; that the attack was police retaliation for the killing of two police officers earlier that day, that the victims had been mistaken for a youth gang and killed by accident, or that the victims had been targeted because a number of them were activists. Later ballistics tests confirmed that the bullets used in the killings were those used by both the Colombian National Police and the Colombian Army. Parents, relatives, and friends of the victims were outspoken about the crime, and publicly demanded justice. They claimed to have been intimidated immediately after the crime at the morgue. As the investigation continued, this intimidation, according to those related to the victims, increased. On the day that the official investigation concluded that wrongdoing had occurred and the names of those accused of committing the massacre had been passed on to the civilian courts, masked men went through the neighborhood searching for a number of people. The local Colombian Army base was alerted, and following a gunfight with the masked men, two of them were wounded and arrested. They were members of the judicial police who had falsified search warrants to hunt down witnesses. Participants in the ensuing trial received numerous death threats. As a result, the trial and investigation were transferred to Bogota. There remains no criminal verdict in the case, and Colonel Hernandez, the man accused of having ordered the attack, remains in his position with the police. A number of the other men who are accused of having been involved have been transferred. By 1996, the government of Colombia had publicly acknowledged that its police officers had committed the attack, and apologized to the families of the victims. In 1998, a first attempt to reach a civil settlement related to the case failed. A second attempt, guided by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, succeeded in producing a settlement in 2002. In it, the government agreed to remunerate the victims, pay for the construction of a memorial to them in a park, and to pursue the criminal charges against the perpetrators. The anniversary of the massacre continues to be observed, and the monument to the victims required by the settlement was built in Parque del Periodista, the Park of Journalists. ==See also== *List of massacres in Colombia ==References== ==External links== *ACNUR: Villatina Massacre *Photo Essay on Villatina and Periodista Park Category:Conflicts in 1992 Category:1992 in Colombia Category:Mass murder in 1992 Category:Massacres in Colombia Category:Political repression in Colombia Category:Colombian conflict Category:November 1992 events in South America Category:1992 murders in South America Category:1990s murders in Colombia Category:1992 crimes in Colombia ","title":"Villatina massacre"},{"id":"9068517","text":"KRDG is a commercial radio station licensed to Shingletown, California, broadcasting to Shasta County and Tehama County areas on FM 105.3.

A rank-and-file investment officer for the CalPERS since 1986, he was elected to the CalPERS Board of Administration in December 2009 as a Member-At-Large representing all CalPERS members. He serves on the Finance Committee, Health Benefits Committee, Investment Committee and is the Vice Chair of the Investment Policy Subcommittee. Jelincic has a wide range of investment experience, having worked in the global equity, fixed income and real estate units of the pension fund's Investment Office. He also helped establish CalPERS futures unit, ran the stock trading desk, and contributed to CalPERS corporate governance initiatives. ==Personal== Jelincic was born in Chico, California, United States, and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area. He earned a bachelor's degree in economics from Saint Mary's College of California in Moraga and has an M.B.A. in finance from Golden Gate University in San Francisco. He holds a Chartered Financial Analyst designation (an international professional designation offered by the CFA Institute). He lives in Hayward with his wife of over 30 years, and has two grown children. ==Union leadership== Jelincic started his union activism as a member of Oakland Teamsters Local 70 while working as a garbage collector and later a truck driver. He joined California state service in 1986 and became active in CSEA's Civil Service Division, which is now known as SEIU Local 1000. He is known for his years of service as chair of the Unit 1 bargaining team, representing more than 43,000 rank-and- file state workers such as employment program representatives at the Employment Development Department (EDD), disability evaluators at the Department of Health Services (DHS), accounting officers, auditors and analysts for all departments.CSEA, Press Release, \\"CSEA members elect new leadership team\\", November 3, 2003. Jelincic was elected in November 2003 as president of the California State Employees Association, on a ticket promising to give the four association affiliates greater control over their individual programs, while working together as CSEA on issues of common interest. He was reelected in October 2005. His term ended October 2007, when he lost to Dave Hart, a fellow member of SEIU Local 1000, an affiliated Union of CSEA. Jelincic was appointed in 2004 by California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger to the California Performance Review (CPR) Commission. As a commissioner, Jelincic participate in public hearings up and down California on proposals to reform state government, put together by the \\"CPR Team\\". He was the only representative of working Californians on the commission. ==CalPERS== In 2009, Jelincic launched a campaign for CalPERS board of administration for Seat A in the at-large election. He has a wide range of support from labor, retirees, and other employee groups. While he receive the most votes out of four candidates, no candidate received a majority of the vote in the first round of balloting. A runoff election was held in December 2009, and Jelincic defeated Cathy Hackett. Jelincic is known for being an outspoken advocate for retirement security of working people. He frequently appears in the media about the subject. In August/September 2015, this took the form of criticism of CALPERS staff for their approach to fees paid to private equity fund managers. ==Sexual harassment== On September 14, 2011, the LA Times reported that Mr. Jelincic was censured after he received a reprimand for sexually harassing co-workers while he was an investment adviser. \\"As part of the board's reprimand, Jelincic was stripped until March 1 of his position as chairman of the pension fund's investment policy subcommittee and vice chairman of the health benefits committee. He also lost most of his board travel privileges for the same period.\\" The State Personnel Board upheld the reprimand. Two years later, in 2013, Jelincic was re-elected to another four year term on the Board. In 2019, after retiring from active service as an employee with CalPERS, Jelincic challenged incumbent Henry Jones for a seat on the Board designated as an “at large” representative of all CalPERS retirees. In a series of articles in the Sacramento Bee, the accusers from the original complaint in 2011 came forward and reiterated their opposition to Jelincic’s presence on the Board and publicly challenged his candidacy and inaction of the Board regarding his behavior. As a result of the increased visibility of the issue, California State Treasurer Fiona Ma and state Senator Connie Leyva, chair of the Legislative Women’s Caucus initiated a letter signed by them and other prominent women leaders demanding that Jelincic remove his name from the ballot because of his failure to acknowledge or take responsibility for his behavior. Jelincic subsequently lost his election bid by a 66 to 34% margin but challenged the 2019 election results (using a process outlined in state law using independent arbitrators) alleging various violations of internal CalPERS campaign procedures chiefly regarding the publicizing of his sexual harassment history. He withdrew his challenge one day before an initial hearing with the Office of Administrative Hearings. ==Strained Relations on the CalPERS Board== Jelincic also ran into trouble with other members of the CalPERS Board in 2017 over an alleged breach of rules relating to the leak of confidential Board documents to news outlets. Jelincic maintained he was upholding principles of transparency and denied he was the source of the leaks. Without admitting guilt, he agreed to attend training on confidentiality as a Board member, but his relationship with Board members was strained. ==See also== * California State Employees Association * SEIU Local 1000 ==References== ==External linksSelect media coverage=== *Sacramento Bee: Labor coalition re-elects leader *Sacramento News & Review, Guest Comment: Responsible action *SFGate: Union officer seeks Schwarzenegger OK for time off ===Testimony and statements=== *Statement before the California Little Hoover Commission *CSEA Responds to New Richman Pension Initiative *Letter to the Editor of Sacramento Bee re: CalPERS CoPay Increases *Letter to Editor of USA Today *CSEA Criticizes Governor's \\"Borrow and Spend\\" Budget Plan *CSEA Calls for Honesty in Dealing with Public Employee Benefits *Column in Capitol Weekly on Thank You State Workers Day Category:Leaders of American trade unions Category:Living people Category:1948 births Category:CFA charterholders Category:People from Hayward, California Category:Activists from California ","title":"J.

The fact that Greek Southern Italy produced its own red-figure pottery as early as the end of the 5th century B.C. was first established by Adolf Furtwaengler in 1893 (A.D. Trendall). Prior to that this pottery had been first designated as \\"Etruscan\\" and then as \\"Attic.\\" Archaeological proof that this pottery was actually being produced in South Italy first came in 1973 when a workshop and kilns with misfirings and broken wares was first excavated at Metaponto, proving that the Amykos Painter was located there rather than in Athens (A.D. Trendall, p. 17). == Overview == The interchange of iconography, techniques, and ideas between the major pottery centers of the Hellenistic Period was formidable. One can see the influences of Corinth, Athens, Etruria, and cross pollination throughout the fabrics of Magna Graecia. There are five regions which produced South Italian ware: Apulia, Lucania, Paestum, Campania, and Sicily. These regions, in turn, had various workshops within them. *Apulian ware was almost all made in various workshops in Taras (Taranto). *Lucanian ware was made in Heraklea and Metaponto. *Paestan ware was all made in Poseidonia (Paestum). *Campanian ware was made in Capua and Kyme (Cumae). *Sicilian ware was made in Syracuse and Lipari. Later centers also developed in Teano (Campania), Canosa (Apulia), and Gnathia (Apulia), but these potteries are moving away from Classical red figure towards the less figurative work of the later Hellenistic and Graeco- Roman Periods. All South Italian fabrics were originally scions from the Attic workshops of Athens, when artists began to leave that city following the Peloponnesian Wars. The earliest workshops seem to have been founded in Lucania, and Apulia. Others were founded in Sicily, and then scions from the Sicilian workshops established those in Paestum and Campania. South Italian ware illustrates many ancient Greek dramas and myths which are unknown in Mainland Greek pottery fabrics like those of Athens (Attic ware), Sparta (Laconian ware), and Corinth (Corinthian ware). Almost all of the pottery forms developed in Greece were also produced in South Italy. However, South Italian potters developed some of these traditional forms in new directions. For instance, Apulian potters take the volute krater and loutrophoros to new heights of fancy, making them far more elaborate than their Athenian forerunners. Apulian potters, having a taste for the frilly and elaborate, take traditional forms such as the Panathenaic amphora, the oinochoe, the lekythos, attenuate their forms, exaggerate their flares, add volute handles, molded gorgonions, affectionately dubbed \\"macaroons\\", and end up with extremely elegant new varieties of pottery which still fit within the Hellenistic aesthetic, and end up becoming standard in the subsequent Graeco- Roman world. New Italiote forms come about through experimentation and borrowing from local Italic cultures. In Campania, the bail amphora was invented. This is an amphora shape which has a single handle across the mouth rather than the usual double handles on the neck or shoulder. Local Italic forms made by native peoples were also borrowed into the South Italian repertoire. The Messapian trozzella is borrowed and becomes the nestoris, an elaborate form having a large belly, a pair of lug handles, a pair of neck to shoulder handles, and molded rosettes. Some elements of decoration were also innovative. Apulian artists use polychromatic, coiling tendrils and flower forms including roses, poppies, and whirling swirls to fill necks and other traditionally black areas of vases. Frequent use is made of portrait or cameo faces of nymphs and satyrs. Rosettes, vine leaves, and other fillers get more and more elaborate. Italiote artists also created a technique called \\"sovradipinto,\\" in which multiple layers of colored slips were used to add chiaroscuro (highlight and lowlight) for figures and decorations. The Campanian artists seem to have favored the use of a broader palette of colors than the other fabrics, often making female figures with white skin, while leaving male figures in red, and then adding many purple red, yellow, and white details all over the vases. Italiote artists were also extremely adept at using the false red figure technique, also known as Six's technique. This is the application of red and white slips on top of the black gloss rather than leaving figures and designs in reserve, as was the usual Athenian custom. This technique was also very popular in Etruria and may hail from that region. == Bibliography == * South Italian Vase Painting by A.D. Trendall * Red Figure Vases of South Italy and Sicily by A.D.

It was created after the dissolution of Gran Colombia in 1830, with the secession of Ecuador (Quito, Guayaquil and Azuay) and Venezuela (with Orinoco, Apure and Zulia). In November 1831, with the adoption of a new constitution, the country was officially renamed New Granada, but had no official currency, iconography, coat of arms or flag upon establishment. Older flags of Gran Colombia were confirmed as provisional by the National Convention of 17 December 1831. It is not clear which flag was chosen: Restrepo believes that it was the flag with the two cornucopias of Gran Colombia. While new flags were being discussed, some proposals were issued. On 9 May 1834, the national flag was adopted and was used until 26 November 1861, with the Gran Colombian colors in Veles' arrangement. The merchant ensign had the eight-pointed star in white. In 1851, a civil war broke out when conservative and pro-slavery groups from Cauca and Antioquia departments, led by Manuel Ibánez, Julio Arboleda, and Eusebio Borrero, revolted against liberal president José Hilario López, in an attempt to prevent emancipation of disenfranchised groups and abolishment of slavery, in addition to a number of religious issues. ==Colombian constitution of 1832== One of the prime features of the political climate of the republic was the position of the Roman Catholic Church and the level of autonomy for the federal states. In 1839, a dispute arose over the shutting down of monasteries by the Congress of New Granada. This soon escalated into the War of the Supremes, which raged for the next two years and transformed into a conflict about regional autonomy. New Granada was transformed in 1858 to the Granadine Confederation as an answer to demands for a decentralized country. ==Provinces== The territory of the republic was divided into provinces. Each province was composed of one or more cantons, each canton was divided into several districts. The republic also included some territories in the peripheries of the country. ==See also== *Colombia Category:1831 establishments in the Republic of New Granada Category:1858 disestablishments in the Republic of New Granada Category:States and territories established in 1831 Category:States and territories disestablished in 1858 ","title":"Republic of New Granada"},{"id":"9068834","text":"is a Japanese boxing-themed yankī manga series written and illustrated by Masanori Morita and serialized in Weekly Shōnen Jump from May 1988 to February 1997.

Taison is also known as one of the Tokyo's elite 4s, or \\"Heavenly Kings\\", and aims to become the world champion in boxing. Taison has an interest for Chiaki Nanase. His name is based on wrestler Akira Maeda and former world heavyweight champion Mike Tyson. He lives with his brother in the Honky Tonk apartment complex. Him and his older brother both left the south of Japan for Tokyo to avoid inheriting their father's profession, that of a monk. He is a lightweight when it comes to drinking and always breaks down into tears. ; Onizuka :The most cruel of the 4 \\"Heavenly Kings\\", Onizuka come from the Shibuya district of Tokyo. He controls the school he attends with an iron fist, forcing his classmates to pay protection fees for their safety. When Maeda and his friends protect one of Onizuka's classmates from him, a bloody war ensues between the two of them, with Onizuka shoving Sakamura out of a second floor window, breaking Mutoh's ribs and capturing the rest of Maeda's friends. In their final confrontation Onizuka injures both of Maeda's hands and stabs a screwdriver through his leg. In the end however, Maeda uses the trademark karate kick he learned from his father to knock Onizuka out. During middle school, him and Akagi were classmates until Onizuka broke most of his teeth with a chair during a fight and Akagi transferred schools. After his defeat at Maeda's hands, Onizuka changes dramatically, respecting his friends and losing his cruelty. Keeping with the punk rock look of most of the characters, Onizuka is strongly modeled off of Billy Idol. ; Yakushiji :Yakushiji is a seemingly carefree, hopeless romantic who has terrible luck in love. He lives in Asakusa. Highly superstitious, throughout the manga he can often be seen reading his horoscope and visiting shrines for luck. However, his laid-back demeanor hides his fighting strength and his martial prowess. He often lapses into melancholy and seems the smartest and wisest of The 4 Heavenly Kings. When he was younger, he and Chiaki used to be best friends, and he often thinks about her. He has a Teddy boy hairstyle which is dyed brown. Maeda has an intense dislike towards Yakushiji due to his relationship with Chiaki. ;Kasai :The most violent and perhaps the strongest of the 4 Heavenly Kings, Kasai is filled with an all-consuming need to prove himself and keep the respect of his classmates by beating up anybody that he considers strong. The school he goes to has the worst reputation in all of Tokyo and is considered a Yakuza recruitment ground. Having dominated everybody in Ikebukuro he decides to once and for all prove who is the strongest of the 4 Heavenly Kings by humiliating each and every one of them. His rage and his desire to be number one starts to overwhelm him and destroy his sanity and his friendships. Shinjo, a main character from Morita's other manga, Rookies, closely resembles Kasai in both appearance and personality. ===Kichijōji=== Kichijōji is the area of Tokyo that Maeda and his friends are from. At the start of the manga most of the action that takes place involves the different schools from the area such as Yonekura Industrial before branching off into the other districts of Tokyo and even to the south of Japan. ===Teiken High=== ; : An intelligent, beautiful and emotional girl that's the complete opposite of Taison, she cares deeply about him. Many of the characters fall in love with Chiaki during the manga, much to Maeda's annoyance as he has severe jealousy issues. One of her best friends from her childhood was Yakushiji, who is now one of the \\"Heavenly Kings\\" of Tokyo. She is head of the sport's committee in Teiken High. ; : One of Maeda's best friends. Gets extremely angry whenever someone mentions his wide forehead. While the only one with a proper girlfriend in the series, they constantly fight and bicker, each accusing the other of infidelity. His father runs a motorbike repair shop and Maeda usually makes Katsuji repair his mopeds and loan him porn movies. Katsuji has been best friends with Yoneji since Preschool and, originally, his bully. ; : One of Maeda's best friends. Gets extremely angry whenever his large nose is mentioned. Had a crush on Chiaki early on in the manga but never really did anything because he knew Taison liked her. Despite his appearance as a delinquent, he is excellent at school, getting full marks on most tests and is meant to be pretty good at art. Yoneji has a large scar on his head from when he was hit with a rock and keeps his hair thick to hide it. His girlfriend, Sayuri, lives in the south of Japan. ; Yutaro Hatanaka : A very skilled boxer who attended Teiken High, and is attempting to secure a place in the Olympics. Him and Maeda come to blows, with Maeda knocking him out with a wrestling move. However, when people begin to question the authenticity of the win due to Maeda being two weight categories heavier than Hatanaka and him not fighting in a straight boxing match Maeda forces Hatanaka to fight him again. This time Hatanaka easily defeats the emaciated Maeda. He leaves Teiken to train at boxing at a prestigious college by the sea. He is very easy-going and cheerful, but can be moved to anger. He used to be one mistake away from being expelled from Teiken High. According to Hatanaka, Maeda has been the only one to knock him down yet in a boxing match and that no one at his college compares to him. ; Hamada : One of the original members of the boxing club and the person that took over running it when Hatanaka left. Hamada managed to bring the boxing club back to life and return it to its former glory after Hatanaka left. An extremely honourable and noble person, Hamada eventually got himself expelled in an effort to protect Seiji, who was forced by a teacher to plant cigarettes on him. To ease Seiji's guilt and stop him from admitting what he did to his friends, Hamada hit the teacher in question to make the whole point moot. He later finds work at a building site, and his friends are pleased that he found a job that he enjoys. ; :The leader of the Cheering Squad. He is recognized for his moustache, large frame and strong tolerance towards alcohol. At the start of the manga, the Cheering Squad and Boxing Squad were in the middle of a feud, but this was quickly sorted out by Taison and his friends. He is twenty years old, having to continuously repeat his final year. ; Hidekazu Ohashi :Original member of the Boxing Club that was involved in the dispute between Hatanaka and Maeda. He is well known for his extremely strong punch and his bright blong, permed haircut. He is best friends with Mutoh and the two both had to repeat their final year together. While originally a mediocre and below average boxer, during his repeat year he started training and working out seriously, being the last member of the original boxing club left. ; Mutoh :Member of the Cheering Squad. Mutou is recognizable from his large scar under his right eye. This was accidentally self-inflicted when Mutou rubbed away tears when his hand was bandaged with a blade. When he was younger, he had a large, comical afro. Even though they were bitter enemies at the start of the manga, Ohashi and Mutoh are best friends. ;Ebihara \\"Marcy\\" Masatoshi :A first year at Teiken High and one of its most powerful fighters, Ebihara is skilled at most martial arts and at using improvised weapons. Originally an antagonist at Teiken when he first arrived, Ebihara was able to overpower Maeda the first time they fought. He is recognisable by his distinctive mod look and the bandana he uses to prop up his overflowing mass of hair. This bandana is used to hide the large, disfiguring scar Ebihara has left over from middle school. This has left him with a crippling fear of knives and can go into a blind panic when he sees one. His nickname \\"Marcy\\" comes from when he used to be in the Masako motorbike gang. ;Oba Hiroto :A first year student, he trusts Taison with his life. ; :A first year student and Oba Hiroto's best friend. ; :Chiaki's best friend and Katsuji's girlfriend. She can be a bit ditzy at times. ;Mika :A girl in Maeda's class that used to have a serious crush on him. Ohashi used think she had a thing for him but was sadly proved wrong. She now goes out with Koheiji's younger brother. ;Junichi Nakajima :Junichi is one of Maeda's classmates. An avid photographer, Nakajima is considered an annoyance by Maeda and his gang, especially whenever sports are involved. He is the head of and only member of Teiken's photography club and usually must resort to selling risque photos of his female classmates to magazines in order to keep it running. Maeda, or someone else, almost always breaks his cameras by accident whenever he is around. ;Mafuyu : A sukeban, Mafuyu used to be part of the destructive bike gang Brown Sugar, until she fell in love with Takeshi, a Misako, and rival gang member. She almost killed herself on Valentine's Day before Maeda stopped her. She eventually overcomes her despair and falls in love again. ;Masahiko Kondo :A kind hearted and much loved teacher at Teiken High, Masa often despairs over Maeda and his friends failure at making grades. Maeda has great respect for Masa and it was under Masa's guidance that Hatanaka got one last shot at getting a boxing scholarship at college. When he was younger he was on the Japanese olympic team for wrestling but never actually managed to compete in the olympics. ===Yonekura Industrial=== ; Shimabukuro :One of Maeda's longer running adversaries. They met when Shimabukuro crashed his car into Maeda's, inadvertently saving his, and his friends lives from an oncoming train. Mistaken identity later led the two to become enemies. A long-running joke in the manga is that Maeda and Shimabukuro always meet by helping the other out, only to fight when they realize who it is they are dealing with. He is a strong fighter, coming 2nd place in the Japanese High School Judo Finals. While he should be in his final year at Yonekura, he had to repeat 2nd year due to poor grades. Him and Maeda seem to be of equal strength, though Shimabukuro knocked Maeda out with a Judo slam during their only serious fight. The two later resolved the conflict in hospital, both suffering from chicken pox. While often at each others throats, the other characters often wonder whether or not they're best friends. ; Yahiro :Sakamato's underclassmen who is the complete opposite of him. Yahiro often fights with Sakamoto, especially over his rigid sense of honour. He is an extremely competent fighter, having fought and beaten multiple opponents, and having even beaten Sakamoto once in a fight. He is extremely disrespectful and proud, usually considering himself above everyone else, and even though he treats Sakamoto the same way, it is obvious the two are close friends. ===Misako Technical College=== ; Tsuyoshi Mihara :The boss of Misako College and of the gang of the same name, Mihara was put into prison before the start of the manga. When he returns he plans on getting revenge on Teiken because it was Mafuyu who got him put there and for when Yoneji came to the school and beat up Naoto. Maeda manages to defeat him by bashing his head in on the gravestone of Mafuyu's boyfriend, who he had blinded in one eye and crashed his motorbike as a result. ; Naoto :A pupil at Misako and a former classmate of Yoneji and Katsuji's when they were still at middle school. Something of a ladies man, Naoto seduced Yoneji's girlfriend at the time Sayuri, into giving him a kiss. Yoneji witnessed this and because of that hates Naoto and broke it off with his girlfriend. When Sayuri returns into his life, he gets revenge on Naoto and manages to defeat, even though he trains at karate. ; Takeshi :A former pupil and gang member of Misako, he died in a motorcycle accident before the manga started. He and Mafuyu used to go out and it was this relationship which brought about Mihara's wrath. He was blinded in one eye when Mihara punched him and was told by doctors not to drive, advice which he sadly didn't follow. ==MediaManga=== Rokudenashi Blues is written and illustrated by Masanori Morita.

However, an injury in the playoffs limited him to just one game, in which he had no points. Prior to the 1983–84 season, the Knights dealt Belanger to the Kingston Canadians. His offensive production exploded in Kingston, as he registered 90 points (44 goals and 46 assist in 67 games. The Canadians failed to make the playoffs that season. In the 1984 NHL Entry Draft, the Pittsburgh Penguins chose Belanger with their third pick of the first round, the 16th choice overall, following their selections of Mario Lemieux (1st overall) and Doug Bodger (8th). Belanger stepped right into the rebuilding Penguins' lineup in the 1984–85 season, and had eight points (three goals and five assists) in 44 games. The Penguins sent him back to the OHL, where his rights were traded to the Hamilton Steelhawks and in three regular season games in Hamilton, Belanger had six points (3G-3A). Belanger helped the Steelhawks in the playoffs with 13 points, including three goals, in 17 games. In 1985–86, Belanger failed to crack the Penguins' lineup and found himself with the Baltimore Skipjacks of the AHL, as he recorded 17 goals and 38 points in 69 games in what proved to be the last injury-free season of his career. The following year Belanger played in 32 games with Baltimore, getting 20 points (nine goals and 11 assists), then spent time with the Muskegon Lumberjacks of the IHL, where he had a goal and two assists in five games. In 1987–88, Belanger was beset with numerous injuries and played in just five games with the Lumberjacks, getting a goal and three assists, then played two games with the New Haven Nighthawks of the AHL, where he went scoreless. That proved to be the end of Belanger's playing career, as he retired from hockey in 1988 due to injuries. == Death == Belanger died September 16, 2011, from a heart attack at his home in Welland, Ontario.

Members are health professionals providing primary health care services in underserved communities since 1972. In exchange, the providers are given either loan repayment or scholarship throughout their medical education (not to exceed four years). The scholarship program provides for students' reasonable educational expenses (tuition, books and other required services like health insurance) and a monthly stipend for room and board. After school (and residency for medical, osteopathic medical, and dental students) the student must apply for pre-approved positions in underserved areas. The student must apply just like any job applicant. If the applicant chooses a specialty other than primary care, or otherwise does not fulfill the service requirement, he/she must repay the government 3 times the investment with interest. The loan repayment program works similarly; however, the students apply for the program after school and the NHSC repays up to $50,000 every two years. There is also the option to work in an NHSC approved location for 5 years, which entitles the student to potentially receive $170,000 in loan repayment.

He is famous for making New York City's Times Square the site of some of the world's most famous neon signs, or electric billboards. Leigh also designed the colored lighting scheme for the Empire State Building. ==Biography== After financing his education at the University of Florida by buying the exclusive right to sell advertising for the yearbook, Leigh became a top salesman for a sign company in Birmingham. In 1929, he moved to New York and got a job at the General Outdoor Advertising Company, but quit in 1933 to strike out on his own. The celebrated smoking Camel cigarette billboard in Times Square was designed by Douglas Leigh and mounted on the Hotel Claridge. (Photo, 1948) Leigh then designed a sign for the St. Moritz Hotel in exchange for the right to live there and to use the hotel's address at 50 Central Park South for his business. From there, Leigh proceeded to transform the signs at Times Square. His first eye-catching creation was a billboard for A&P;, advertising the store's Eight O'Clock Coffee with clouds of steam emanating from a large cup of coffee. A Camel billboard blew smoke rings from a steam generator, while one for Kool cigarettes featured a blinking penguin. One for Ballantine Beer had clowns tossing quoits on a peg. The Coca-Cola sign at Bryant Park gave an ever-changing weather forecast (featuring a house and pictures of sun, rain, snow, etc.) along with the slogan \\"Thirst knows no season\\" (Leigh paid a tenant's weekly laundry bills to stop her from hanging her laundry on her clothesline in front of the sign). Leigh's design creation of a large illuminated snowflake, which was 17 feet wide by 14 feet tall and had 12,000 crystals, is hung at the intersection of Fifth Avenue and 57th Street every holiday season. Many of Leigh's creations have been replaced with newer signs, for which Leigh set the bar. Leigh also lent his talents as a consultant for outdoor displays and spectaculars to Freedomland U.S.A., a New York City theme park, during its 1960 debut. He is featured in the book, Freedomland U.S.A.: The Definitive History (Theme Park Press, 2019). He was the step-grandfather of Prince Lorenzo Borghese. ==References== ==External links== * Current Biography 1940, pp 489–91. * Douglas Leigh archives at the Smithsonian Institution * Bio at Smithsonian website * NPR \\"Douglas Leigh Obituary\\" Category:Neon lighting Category:Neon artists Category:1907 births Category:1999 deaths Category:People from Anniston, Alabama Category:Businesspeople from New York City Category:University of Florida alumni ","title":"Douglas Leigh"},{"id":"9069066","text":"The 22 January 2007 Baghdad bombings was a terrorist attack that occurred when two powerful car bombs ripped through the Bab Al-Sharqi market in central Baghdad, killing at least 88 people and wounding 160 others in one of the bloodiest days since the US invasion of Iraq.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6286459.stm \\"Scores killed in Iraq bloodshed\\" BBC News, 22 January 2007. Retrieved on 8 November 2016. The attack occurred two days after the start of the 10-day Shiite festival leading up to Ashoura. It also coincided with the arrival of 3,200 additional troops into Baghdad as part of the Iraq War troop surge of 2007. ==Overview== The attack took place on a Monday, after a weekend in which 27 American soldiers were killed in Iraq. The blasts at the Baghdad market were aimed at a Shiite area and seemed timed to inflict maximum damage, occurring at noon local time, which is one of the busiest times of the day [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/23/world/middleeast/22cnd-iraq.html \\"2 Car Bombs Kill Scores at Packed Market in Baghdad\\" The New York Times, 23 January 2007. Retrieved on 8 November 2016. Police officials said the blasts were so large that each of the cars carried more than 200 pounds of explosives. The explosions could be heard from the eastern banks of the nearby Tigris River. Fires from the explosion engulfed at least a dozen cars, creating clouds of smoke large enough that they drifted over the Green Zone, about half a mile away. The New York Times reported that: Similar attacks by Sunni Arab insurgents targeting Shia civilians often provoked reprisals. According to the Iraq Body Count project, this period of intense sectarian violence resulted in over 150,000 documented civilian deaths.\\"Iraq Body Count\\" Retrieved on 8 November 2016. ==Gun battles== The bombing was followed by prolonged gun battles. The fighting could be heard across the city, although officials did not release any casualty figures from the ensuing skirmishes. At the site of the car bombings, Iraqi Army troops spotted a man on a nearby rooftop shortly after the attack, filming the carnage. According to an Iraqi Army official, the man was killed by gunfire while attempting to escape over the rooftops. The official said the man was an Egyptian and was filming the attack to use as propaganda for the Sunni insurgents. ==Condemnation== Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, whose government has proven incapable of ending the bloodshed, condemned the attack. He blamed the car bombs on followers of Saddam Hussein. At least 70 people were killed in a double bombing outside a Baghdad University during the previous week, an attack Maliki also blamed on Saddam's supporters. A UN envoy said Iraq was sliding \\"into the abyss of sectarianism\\" and urged Iraqi political and religious leaders to halt the violence. ==Other attacks== In addition to the market attacks, at least 15 people were killed and another 39 wounded in coordinated bomb and mortar attacks in the Shiite town of Khalis. Later that same day, a Sunni mosque in the Dura section of Baghdad was blown up; there were no reports of casualties and residents said the attack was likely retribution for the bombing of a Shiite mosque in the same neighborhood during the previous week. Police confirmed that they had found 29 unidentified bodies with gunshot wounds; altogether, more than 130 people were killed in and around the capital. ==References== ==External links== *Bombs kill at least 100 in Iraq The Guardian *Three bomb blasts kill at least 100 in Iraq The Telegraph Category:2007 murders in Iraq Category:Marketplace attacks in Iraq Category:Terrorist incidents in Iraq in 2007 Category:Terrorist incidents in Baghdad Category:Mass murder in 2007 Category:Car and truck bombings in Iraq Category:2000s in Baghdad Category:Violence against Shia Muslims in Iraq Category:January 2007 events in Asia ","title":"22 January 2007 Baghdad bombings"},{"id":"9069067","text":"The San Bernardino Santa Fe Depot (Amtrak designation San Bernardino, Metrolink designation San Bernardino Depot) is a Mission Revival Style passenger rail terminal in San Bernardino, California, United States. It has been the primary station for the city, serving Amtrak today, and the Santa Fe and Union Pacific Railroads in the past. Until the mid-20th century, the Southern Pacific Railroad had a station 3/4 of a mile away. It currently serves one Amtrak (Southwest Chief) and two Metrolink lines (Inland Empire–Orange County Line and San Bernardino Line). The depot is a historical landmark listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Passenger and Freight Depot. ==Early history== Through its subsidiary California Southern Railroad, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway (ATSF) first built a two-and-a-half-story wooden structure on the site in 1886 to replace a converted boxcar that had been used as a temporary station. The 1886 building was mostly destroyed in a fire just after midnight 17 November 1916. In the pre-Amtrak era the station not only had Santa Fe Railway trains, it also had Union Pacific Railroad trains. The trains of both railroads served disparate destinations in the west and in central United States. Named trains in 1960 included: *Santa Fe: **Chief (Los Angeles to Chicago via Albuquerque and Kansas City) **El Capitan (Los Angeles to Chicago via Albuquerque and Kansas City) **Grand Canyon (Los Angeles to Chicago via Albuquerque and Kansas City) **Super Chief (Los Angeles to Chicago via Albuquerque and Kansas City) *Union Pacific: **Challenger (Los Angeles to Chicago via Ogden, UT) **City of Los Angeles (Los Angeles to Chicago via Ogden, UT) **City of St. Louis (Los Angeles to St. Louis via Ogden, UT and Kansas City) ==Architecture and design== Trackside of the San Bernardino Santa Fe Depot Local politicians requested ATSF to build a new station on a much larger scale than the previous. The new station, designed by architect W.A. Mohr, cost $800,000 () to build and was officially opened on 15 July 1918. At that time, it was the largest railway station west of the Mississippi River. The San Bernardino Sun wrote \\"Santa Fe's Station to be the finest in the west.\\" A few years after the depot's opening, an extension was added that included a Harvey House and living quarters. The historic depot is built in the Mission Revival Style with Moorish Revival and Spanish Colonial Revival features. Utilizing hollow clay blocks, a red tile roof and stucco exterior, the depot was designed to withstand fire. Four domed towers are built around a large center lobby with polished tile walls and floor. The interior includes handcrafted high beams, coffered ceilings and decorative column capitals. ==Decline and renovation== The station saw heavy use throughout the 20th century. But like with many railroad stations, there was a gradual decline in usage with the advent of automobiles, buses and air travel. The Harvey House closed in the 1950s. In 1971, the ATSF transferred its passenger service to Amtrak. From 1979 to 1997 Amtrak's Desert Wind (Los Angeles-Las-Vegas-Denver- Chicago) made stops at the station. Metrolink began service to the station on May 17, 1993. Trackside of the original San Bernardino Santa Fe Depot, 1915 In 1992, San Bernardino Associated Governments (SANBAG) purchased the historic depot from Santa Fe. While Amtrak and Metrolink stopped using the depot in favor for a much smaller newer structure on the west side of the older one, SANBAG acquired over $15 million from federal and local grants and funds to begin an extensive restoration of the historic depot beginning in 2002. In 2004, SANBAG and Metrolink moved some of their offices there. After renovations are complete, SANBAG will share ownership with the City of San Bernardino and both agencies intend on leasing space in it. The historic depot waiting area, along with a new snack shop, opened again for Amtrak and Metrolink passengers on 2 May 2008. A new elevator, platforms, tracks, and an overpass were built in March and April 2017 as part of the Downtown San Bernardino Passenger Rail Project, an extension of Metrolink service to the San Bernardino Transit Center. ==Services Metrolink === All San Bernardino Line trains and Inland Empire-Orange County Line trains stop at the station. === Amtrak === Amtrak's Southwest Chief, which travels between Los Angeles and Chicago, Illinois, stops once a day in each direction here. ==Platforms and tracks== ==References*Amtrak California station information * *San Bernardino Amtrak Station (USA Rail Guide -- TrainWeb) *San Bernardino (SNB)--Great American Stations (Amtrak) Category:Amtrak stations in San Bernardino County, California Category:Metrolink stations in San Bernardino County, California Category:Former Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway stations in California Category:Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway hotels Category:Fred Harvey Company Category:National Register of Historic Places in San Bernardino County, California Category:Railway stations on the National Register of Historic Places in California Category:Buildings and structures in San Bernardino, California Category:Defunct hotels in California Category:History of San Bernardino, California Category:1918 establishments in California Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 1918 Category:Mission Revival architecture in California Category:Moorish Revival architecture in California Category:Spanish Colonial Revival architecture in California Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 1886 ","title":"San Bernardino Santa Fe Depot"},{"id":"9069069","text":"Nancy Erickson is an American political aide who served as the 32nd Secretary of the United States Senate from 2007 to 2015.

Hillis was an adventurer. At the age of thirteen in 1926, Dick attended evangelistic meetings at the little Methodist church in town, where his mother served as chairman of the church’s missionary committee. It was during these meetings where Dr. George Bennard, (the author of the gospel hymn The Old Rugged Cross) was the guest speaker, that young Dick Hillis was called to go to China as a missionary. He trained for ministry at the Bible Institute of Los Angeles (BIOLA) and graduated in 1932. ==Missionary career== At the age of 20, Dick Hillis was on his way to China with the China Inland Mission (CIM) (now OMF International), founded by Hudson Taylor. Hillis was the youngest American missionary candidate ever accepted by the CIM. On December 8, 1934, Hillis' CIM colleagues, John and Betty Stam, were beheaded in Tsingteh. CIM mission headquarters in Shanghai sent word of the Stam’s execution to Hillis, who was just completing his first year in China. Hillis reportedly said, \\"Will I, too, be captured and murdered? Am I going to die here, too, Lord, alone and thousands of miles from home?\\" Hillis and his family spent most of World War II in the United States, but returned to China after the war, only to face further conflict between the Chinese Communists and the Chinese Nationalist Party. In 1950 Hillis and his family were expelled from China, and returned to the United States. Soon after Hillis took a position as the Taiwan director of Youth for Christ, and it was at this time that he formed a traveling evangelistic basketball team, which he renamed Venture for Victory and which led Hillis to form his own mission organization. In 1951, Hillis left Youth for Christ and founded \\"Formosa Crusades\\" as he initially responded to Madam Chiang Kai-Shek's request for men to preach to Chinese Nationalist Army soldiers in Taiwan and then to requests of Taiwanese churches that the visiting teams remain to help in training lay people and church personnel. He became General Director (1951-1970); retired for health reasons and in order to provide full-time spiritual leadership of the mission (1970); briefly assumed the newly created position of President (1976) and upon the appointment of Luis Palau as President was named Vice- President-At-Large to actively assist the mission and participate in missions conferences and seminars. On New Year's Eve, 1985, Dr. Dick Hillis received the Far East Broadcasting Company's Founder's Award at the \\"Rejoice '86\\" celebration. Today the global outreaches of OC International continue. ==Personal life== In 1936, Hillis married Margaret Humphrey, a fellow missionary with China Inland Mission. They had six children together. Margaret Hillis died in 1981, and Hillis married Ruth Kopperud in 1982. He passed away on December 14, 2005. ==Quotes== * \\"Every heart with Christ, a missionary; every heart without Christ, a mission field.\\" * \\"God didn't take me to China for what I could do for China, but for what China could do for me.\\" ==Bibliography== * Steel In His Soul, by Jan Winebrenner, 1996, WinePress Publishing. * Developing a Heart for Mission: Five Missionary Heroes, by Roy Robertson, 2002, NavMedia. ==Works== * Authored numerous books on missions, particularly based on his own experiences in Asia, as well as on the role of the Holy Spirit in the Christian's life. * Shall We Forfeit Formosa?, (Zondervan) 1954 * Do We Recognize Red China?, (Zondervan) 1956 * Are the Heathen Really Lost, (Moody Press) 1961 * Unlock the Heavens, (Service Press) 1963 * China Assignment, (Overseas Crusades)1965 * Strange Gods, (Moody Press) 1966 * Born to Climb, (Word Books) 1967 * Inhale the Incense, (Fabrizio Publications) 1970 * Sayings of Mao, Sayings of Jesus, editor, (Regal Books) 1972 * Not Made for Quitting, (Dimension Books) 1973 * The Spirit Speaks: Are You Listening?, (Regal Books) 1980 * Listen to the Spirit, with Don Hillis, (Baker Books) 1984 * What If They Haven't Heard?, (Moody Press) 1986 * I Was Never Called, (Overseas Crusades) ==References== ==External links== * The Dick Hillis Story * OC International * Dick Hillis Memorial page & documents Category:1913 births Category:2005 deaths Category:American Protestant missionaries Category:Biola University alumni Category:Protestant missionaries in China Category:Protestant writers Category:American evangelicals Category:American expatriates in China ","title":"Dick Hillis"},{"id":"9069086","text":"Mannus is a small rural community in the south east part of the Riverina.

It was released posthumously after their breakup in 2002. The material for the album had been recorded in 2000 after the departure of original drummer Kyle Briggs, but even while working on it the other band members had begun to drift into other musical projects and eventually the album was shelved and the group disbanded. However, due to numerous requests from fans in the years immediately following the material was resurrected and released independently, mostly at the behest of lead singer Ariel Rechtshaid. It was promoted as \\"the album they wanted their fans to hear\\" and its cover art includes the message \\"Suonava tra: Marzo del 1996 e Settembre del 2000. Grazie per tutto. Fine,\\" which from Italian loosely translates to \\"Created music from March 1996 to September 2000. Thanks for everything.

It relies heavily on the use of synthesizers and keyboards as opposed to the horn-driven arrangements of their early releases.

Ice tools are used two to a person for the duration of a pitch, and thus in some circumstances such as top-rope-anchored climbs, a pair may be shared among two or more people, where only one of them at a time is climbing. In contrast a classical \\"ice axe\\" is used one to a person for the hours or days a party is traveling across snow or glacier. In communities where it is common to refer to an \\"ice tool\\" simply as an \\"ice axe\\", classic \\"ice axes\\" are often referred to as \\"traveling axes\\", \\"walking axes\\", or \\"general mountaineering axes\\" to distinguish them from \\"tools\\". In climbing of vertical ice, two tools are needed in order for the climber (supported by cramponed feet) to use each tool in turn in maintaining balance with the body's center of mass nearly straight above the toes, while repositioning the other tool to a higher level, before raising the body weight with the legs and thereby setting the stage for repeating the process. ==TypesTraditional ice tools=== Historically the most common type of Ice tool uses a specialized leashes that snugly grips the climbers wrist. The length of the leash is adjusted so that when a climber hangs on a leash their hand remains at the tool's handle portion of the axe shaft. This allows the climber to rest on the axe placement by applying minimal grip to the axe shaft. The greatest disadvantage to a leashed tool is the potential to become stuck on the tool in the rest position without the ability to reach the grip and control the tool ===Leashless ice tools=== Ice Climbing Competition. Italy, Val Daone, 2007. More recently leashless ice tools have emerged. Most modern ice tools are curved in such a way that the shaft of the ice axe isn't vertical when actively placed. Gripping a shaft slightly canted from vertical is usually much less tiring than gripping a vertical shaft. Leashless ice tools further adjust the cant and its position relative to the main shaft to maximize the comfort and control of the axe. These changes as well as the introduction of finger rest rendered it much easier to grip and hold the axe handle negating much of the \\"rest\\" value of leashes. The disadvantages of leashless tools is the climber's inability to \\"rest\\" on their wrists and the potential for dropping a tool en route. Advantages of leashless tools while climbing include the ability to swap tools between hands (or cross and match) plus a climber's ability to move their hands to any part of the tool unrestricted by the leash. A safety advantage is that a climber can not become stuck on their leashes without the ability to reach the tools. This safety feature as well as an effort to make the routes more difficult motivated UIAA to ban leashes during competition. This ban spurred the development of commercial manufactured leashless tools. Leashless tools are now often used in conjunction with a 'springer leash' system. This gives some protection against dropping the tools on a long trad route but still gives the most of the flexibility of going leashless. Each tool is clipped to a bungee cord that terminates on the climbers waist usually clipping to their harness. Wrists are not supported and freedom of movement is still maintained. The springer leash is not designed to arrest a fall should the ice axe remain in place, however this is often what can happen in real- life usage. ===Modified traditional tools=== Many traditional tools are now sold with finger rests or are designed for the easy addition of finger rests. These tools are intended to function with or without leashes. == Design == An ice tool being placed The physical designs of ice tools differ more widely than those of other ice axes. * Modular: Ice tools are extremely modular; most have the ability to change picks and adze/hammer. Many ice tools are designed to accommodate shaft modifications to change the position of a hand while hanging. This is distinct from mountaineering ice axes which are usually produced as a single axe, adze, and shaft component with limited variation in leashes. * Pick variations: Most ice-tool picks are flat, with a (shaftward) \\"drooping\\" direction and a serrated lower edge, but some of these are straight or concave on their upper edges, instead of convex as other ice axes are. With the same kind of design, picks may vary in degree, as to number of teeth, depth of teeth, or thickness, and some are field replaceable, to deal with point damage or to accommodate more than one pick design on the same tool. There are also ice tools with round tubular-nosed, instead of flat, picks. * Adze-end variations: As with non-ice-tool adzes, those of ice tools vary in several aspects; other ice tools have a hammer head in place of the adze, or are modular, permitting switching styles of adze or hammer, and/or between adze and hammer. * Shaft variations: Shafts may be straight, as with shafts of non-ice-tool axes, or have one or two bends or curved sections. Ice tools generally range from 40 to 60 cm in length, with 50 centimetre being by far the most common length. * Spike variations: Non-ice-tool spikes are generally flat and symmetrical, with straight or convex edges meeting at a point. Ice- tool spikes vary widely, including also asymmetrical flat shapes with teeth on one side or two points of different lengths, conical or oval tubular ends, or slightly hooked ends. Many \\"leashless\\" ice tools have abandoned the spike altogether and end with a smooth handle. * Indoor Ice tool: Ice tools are now available for training indoors at the local climbing wall. They follow the leashless design principle with dual position grip but have a rubber strap instead of a steel spike at the end of the shaft. This design allows them to be used on the existing climbing wall alongside other climbers without causing any damage and without any changes having to be made. == See also == *Ice climbing *Dry-tooling *Ice axe == References == == External links == Category:Mountaineering equipment Category:Climbing equipment Category:Ice climbing ","title":"Ice tool"},{"id":"9069294","text":"Khabardar is a popular news show on NDTV India.

Brueghel's influence is clearly evident in many of de Momper's paintings. His work is situated at the transition from late 16th- century Mannerism to the greater realism in landscape painting that developed in the early 17th century. He achieved considerable success during his lifetime.de Momper at Oxford Artist Index ==Life== Landscape with the Fall of Icarus, 1579 - 1635, Nationalmuseum, Stockholm Joos de Momper was born in an artistic family of Antwerp and was named after his grandfather who was a landscape painter.Joos de Momper at the Netherlands Institute for Art History His father was Bartholomeus de Momper the Elder and his mother Suzanna Halfroose. He learned to paint from his father who was a painter, art dealer, printer and publisher.Frans Jozef Peter Van den Branden, Geschiedenis der Antwerpsche schilderschool, Antwerpen, 1883, p. 309-316 Larry Silver, Peasant Scenes and Landscapes: The Rise of Pictorial Genres in the Antwerp Art Market, University of Pennsylvania Press, 2012, p.193-195 In 1581 he became a master in the Antwerp Guild of St. Luke at only 17 years old. It was assumed that in the 1580s he travelled to Italy to study. Evidence for this trip was provided when landscape frescoes in the church of San Vitale in Rome, formerly attributed to Paul Bril, were given to Joos de Momper the Younger.Joos de Momper at Sphinx Fine Art On 4 September 1590 he married Elisabeth Gobijn. The couple had 10 children of whom Philippe de Momper became a painter. The painter Gaspard de Momper was either his son or a nephew.Gaspard de Momper at the Netherlands Institute for Art History His pupils were Louis de Caullery and his son Philippe de Momper. His followers included his nephew Frans de Momper and Hercules Seghers. De Momper enjoyed high-level patronage as is shown by the fact that Archduchess Isabella Clara Eugenia, the governess of the Southern Netherlands, sent in 1616 a letter to the Antwerp magistrate asking him to excuse de Momper from the payment of taxes and fees. The artist could use the tax exemption as in his later years he was not able to paint as diligently as before and he was spending to much money at the inn. De Momper died in Antwerp on 5 February 1635. He left large debts and his possessions were sold off by his creditors. He was mentioned by Karel van Mander in his Schilder-boeck and his likeness was engraved by Anthony van Dyck.Joos de Momper Biography in: Arnold Houbraken, De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen, 1718 ==Work== Flemish Market and Washing Place, ca. 1620, Museum of Prado, Madrid Excursión campestre de Isabel Clara Eugenia, early 17th century, Museo del Prado, Madrid De Momper primarily painted landscapes, the genre for which he was highly regarded during his lifetime. Only a small number of the 500 paintings attributed to de Momper are signed and just one is dated. The large output points to substantial workshop participation. He often collaborated with figure painters such as Frans Francken II, Peter Snayers, Jan Brueghel the Elder and Jan Brueghel the Younger, usually on large, mountainous landscapes, whereby the other painters painted the staffage and de Momper the landscape. His works were often featured in the prestigious gallery paintings of collections (real and imagined) from the early seventeenth century. He painted both fantasy landscapes, viewed from a high vantage point and employing a conventional Mannerist color transition of brown in the foreground to green and finally blue in the background, and more realistic landscapes with a lower viewpoint and more natural colors. His wide panoramas also feature groups of small figures.Irene Haberland, \\"Momper, de\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford University Press, [accessed 8 July 2007]. De Momper’s works are chiefly inspired by the steep craggy Alpine slopes and high rock masses depicted in Pieter Brueghel the Elder's work. His closeness to Jan Brueghel the Elder would have played a role in his exposure to the Bruegel idiom. This is also seen in some of the motifs of De Momper's work which go back to Pieter Bruegel’s inventions, such as winter landscapes and grain harvests. One of his works representing a Storm at Sea was previously attributed to Pieter Brueghel but is now generally ascribed to de Momper. Another influence on De Momper was that of landscape specialist Lodewijk Toeput, who went on to make a career in Italy. De Momper emphasized stylization over naturalistic effects and used depth and atmosphere to achieve his goal of spatial construction. De Momper's work, like that of the contemporary landscape painter Abel Grimmer, has often been dismissed for its formulaic repetition of stock motifs and presentation while his large works have been interpreted as merely a ‘‘broad-brush’’ version of Joachim Patinir’s world landscape a century after its first formulation. He is regarded as representing the end of a tradition rather than a revitalization or an innovation of landscape painting as was happening in the Dutch Republic in the 17th century. On the other hand, the large size of his works and his collaboration with other leading artists suggest costliness and esteem for pictorial refinement. ==Notable works== *Minerva's Visit to the Muses (with Hendrik van Balen for the figures and Jan Breughel the Elder for the flowers) - Royal Museum of Fine Arts, Antwerp *Flemish Market and Washing Place - Museo del Prado, Madrid *Landscape with the Temptation of Christ - National Gallery Prague * Large Mountain Landscape - Liechtenstein Museum, Vienna *Dune Landscape with Travelers and Cattle - National Museum, Warsaw ==Gallery== File:Landscape with Sea and Mountains (1).jpgLandscape with Sea and Mountains, c. 1623, Museum of Prado, Madrid Jood de Momper Jan Brueghel the Elder Hermitage.jpgRocky Landscape with a Waterfall, c. 1610, Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg File:Landpass de Momper.jpgLandscape with a Mountain Pass, c. 1620, Liechtenstein Museum, Vienna File:'A Hermit before a Grotto' by Joos de Momper the Younger and Jan Brueghel the Elder.jpgMountain Landscape with Pilgrims in a Grotto Chapel, c. 1616, Liechtenstein Museum, Vienna File:Mountain Landscape de Momper.jpgMountain Landscape, ca. 1625, Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna File:Jan Brueghel (I) & Joos de Momper (II) - Summer landscape with harvesters (Toledo Museum of Art).jpgSummer landscape with harvesters, Museum of Art, Toledo, Ohio ==See also== *Flemish painting ==References== ==External links== * Category:1564 births Category:1635 deaths Category:Flemish Baroque painters Category:Flemish landscape painters Category:Artists from Antwerp Category:Members of the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke Category:Flemish Mannerist painters ","title":"Joos de Momper"},{"id":"9069369","text":"Hineni Youth and Welfare or Hineni is a Modern Orthodox, politically active, Zionist youth movement.

The shock had a moment magnitude of 7.3 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of IX (Violent). ==Earthquake== At 4:57 a.m. local time (11:57 UTC) on June 28, 1992, a magnitude 7.3 earthquake awoke much of Southern California. Though it turned out it was not the so-called \\"Big One\\" as many people would think, it was still a very strong earthquake. The shaking lasted for two to three minutes. Although this earthquake was much more powerful than the 1994 Northridge earthquake, the damage and loss of life were minimized by its location in the sparsely-populated Mojave Desert. The earthquake was a right-lateral strike-slip event, and involved the rupture of several different faults over a length of . The names of those that were involved are the Johnson Valley, Kickapoo (also known as Landers), Homestead Valley, Homestead/Emerson, Emerson Valley and Camp Rock faults. The surface rupture extended for , with a maximum horizontal displacement of and a maximum vertical displacement of . ===Damage=== Damage to the Yucca Lanes Bowling Center from the 1992 quake Damage to the area directly surrounding the epicenter was severe. Roads were buckled, buildings and chimneys collapsed. There were also large surface fissures. To the west in the Los Angeles Basin damage was much less severe. The majority of damage in the Los Angeles area involved items which had fallen off shelves. Unlike the 1994 Northridge earthquake nineteen and a half months later, no freeway bridges collapsed because of the epicenter's remote location. Electricity was cut to thousands of residents, but was generally restored within two to three hours. There was also some damage to homes from water displaced from swimming pools. Loss of life in this earthquake was minimal. Two people died as a result of heart attacks, and a 3-year-old boy from Massachusetts, who was visiting Yucca Valley with his parents, died when bricks from a chimney collapsed into a living room where he was sleeping. More than 400 people sustained injuries as a result of the earthquake. USGS ShakeMap for the event ===Related events=== The quake was preceded by the 6.1 magnitude Joshua Tree earthquake at 4:51 on April 23, 1992 (UTC), which was south of the future Landers epicenter.The 1992 Landers Earthquake Sequence: Seismological Observations The 6.5 magnitude Big Bear earthquake, which hit about three hours after the Landers mainshock, was originally considered an aftershock. However, the United States Geological Survey determined that this was a separate, but related, earthquake. These two earthquakes are considered a regional earthquake sequence, rather than a main shock and aftershock. The 5.7 magnitude Little Skull Mountain (LSM) earthquake the following day, June 29, 1992, at 10:14 UTC near Yucca Mountain, Nevada, is also considered part of the regional sequence and may have been triggered by surface wave energy produced by the Landers earthquake. Foreshock activity, in the form of a significant increase in micro-earthquakes, was observed at Little Skull Mountain following the Landers earthquake, and the activity continued until the main LSM earthquake. ===Theories=== The Landers earthquake and the other large quakes associated with it in the Mojave region have been attributed to two possible long-term trends. One of these is that the San Andreas Fault may be in the process of being replaced as the plate boundary (between the North American Plate and the Pacific Plate) by a new trend across the Mojave and east of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. The other is that these quakes were a manifestation of the propagation of rifting coming up from the Gulf of California. Research is ongoing. ==In popular culture== The earthquake is featured in the television documentary series produced by GRB Entertainment, aired on The Learning Channel and other television chanels around the world, about natural disasters titled Earth's Fury (also known internationally as Anatomy of Disaster) in an episode entitled \\"Earthquake!\\" ==See also== * List of earthquakes in California * List of earthquakes in the United States * 1999 Hector Mine earthquake * 2010 Baja California earthquake * 2019 Ridgecrest earthquakes == References == == Further reading == * * == External links == * Landers Earthquake at the Southern California Earthquake Data Center * Big Bear Earthquake at the Southern California Earthquake Data Center * Studying the M7.3 1992 Landers, California earthquake: original forms and initial modifications – Ramon Arrowsmith * 1992 Category:1992 earthquakes ","title":"1992 Landers earthquake"},{"id":"9069408","text":"Sangvi is a village in Parola Taluka of Jalgaon district in northwestern part of the state of Maharashtra, India. ==Geography== Sangvi is located at .Falling Rain Genomics, Inc - Sangvi It has an average elevation of 197 metres (649 feet).

The adult has brown upperparts with some faint streaking and a plain brown rump. The head has a finely white- streaked crown, dark face, and white supercilium and chin. The underparts are warm buff. The sexes are similar, but some females show a little breast streaking. The juvenile has less head streaking, a dull supercilium, more heavily streaked upperparts, and heavy streaking on the pale grey underparts. ==Distribution and habitat== Its habitat is open woodland and scrub, including savanna, orchards, and gardens. It builds a compact cup nest in a scrub. ==Behaviour== The streaky-headed seedeater is usually seen in pairs, but can be gregarious, forming large flocks, alone or with other canary species. It feeds on soft fruit, weed seeds and buds, and sometimes takes insects. Large flocks can damage sunflower, millet and other cereal crops. This is an unobtrusive finch, often perching inside bushes. Its call is a soft tseee, and the song is a wit-chee-chee-chee-cha cha cha cha chip, interspersed with mimicry of other species.

La Habana, Editorial Letras Cubanas. , p. 130 According to the testimony of Enrique Jorrín, he composed some danzones in which the musician of the orchestra had to sing short refrains, and this style was very successful. In the danzón \\"Constancia\\", he introduced some montunos and the audience was motivated to join in singing the refrains. Jorrín also asked the members of the orchestra to sing in unison so the lyrics might be heard more clearly and achieve a greater impact in the audience. That way of singing also helped to mask the poor singing skills of the orchestra members. In 1948, Jorrín changed the style of a Mexican song by Guty Cárdenas, called \\"Nunca\\", composing a separate part for the trio or montuno of danzón; and in 1951 he composed a signature cha-cha-chá, \\"La engañadora\\". Jorrín noticed that most of the dancers had some trouble with highly syncopated rhythms and therefore he simplified the musical texture of his pieces, using as little syncopation as possible. The novel Cha cha chá style was born from melodies that were very easy to dance.Orovio, Helio. 1981. Diccionario de la Música Cubana. La Habana, Editorial Letras Cubanas. , p. 130-132 Since its inception, cha-cha-chá music has had a close relationship with the dancer's steps. The name cha-cha-chá came into being with the help of the dancers at the Silver Star Club in Havana. When the dance was coupled to the rhythm of the music, it became evident that the dancer's feet were making a peculiar sound as they grazed the floor on three successive beats. Cha-cha-chá was an onomatopoeia to describe this sound. == Characteristics == Typical piano accompaniment to a cha-cha-chá (Orovio 1981:132) According to Odilio Urfé, cha-cha-chá was a musical genre that was based on the rhythm of danzón-mambo but with a different structural conception. It utilized elements of chotis madrileño and a monodic vocal style. After \\"La Engañadora\\", Urfé's original structure was greatly modified by Jorrín and other composers.Urfé, Odilio: Del Mambo y el Cha-cha-chá. In Bailes Populares Cubanos, 1974. Fernández, María Antonia. La Habana, Editorial Pueblo y Educación Cuban musicologist Olavo Alén emphasizes the inheritance that cha-cha-chá received from danzón. He says that actually, cha-cha-chá appears to be a derivative of danzón. It maintains a very similar structure to that of danzón, while transforming the melodic and rhythmic elements used in the composition of each of its sections. The interpretative function of the flute is retained: its role as a soloist, and the characteristics of its improvisation in danzón reappear in cha-cha-chá with hardly any alteration. The melodies of the violins alternate with those of the flute and the voices in a way that became standardized in danzón and danzonete. The principal element that differentiates cha-cha-chá from danzón is the rhythmic cell that gives its name to the genre. It is also significant that cha-cha-chá abandons the elements from son that were incorporated into the danzonete, and returns to the strict utilization of stylistic elements that arose and were developed in the context of the danzón.Alén Rodríguez, Olavo. 1994. De lo Afrocubano a la Salsa. La Habana, Ediciones ARTEX. ==Further development== According to Olavo Alén: \\"During the 1950s, cha-cha-chá maintained its popularity thanks to the efforts of many Cuban composers who were familiar with the technique of composing danzones and who unleashed their creativity on the cha-cha-chá\\", such as Rosendo Ruiz, [Jr.] (\\"Los Marcianos\\" and \\"Rico Vacilón\\"), Félix Reina (\\"Dime Chinita,\\" \\"Como Bailan Cha-cha-chá los Mexicanos\\"), Richard Egües (\\"El Bodeguero\\" and \\"La Cantina\\") and Rafael Lay (\\"Cero Codazos, Cero Cabezazos\\").Alén Rodríguez, Olavo. 1994. De lo Afrocubano a la Salsa. La Habana, Ediciones ARTEX. Although the cha-cha-chá rhythm originated with Orquesta América, some scholars, including John Santos (1982), consider the Orquesta Aragón of Rafael Lay and Richard Egües, and the orchestra Fajardo y sus Estrellas of José Fajardo, to have been particularly influential in the development of cha-cha-chá. The coincidental emergence of television and LP records were significant factors in the sudden international popularity of the music and dance of cha-cha-chá.Santos, John. 1982. The Cuban Danzón (Liner Notes). New York, Folkways Records FE 4066 Cha-cha-chá was first presented to the public through the instrumental medium of charanga, a typical Cuban dance band format made up of a flute, strings, piano, bass and percussion. The popularity of cha-cha-chá also revived the popularity of this kind of orchestra.Alén Rodríguez, Olavo. 1994. De lo Afrocubano a la Salsa.

It first flew in May 1914 at their Le Crotoy aerodrome. The aircraft had a short crew nacelle, with a single engine in the nose of the nacelle, and an open tailboom truss. It was of sesquiplane layout, and used wing warping for lateral control, although this was replaced by conventional ailerons fitted on the upper wing in late production aircraft. Usually, the G.3 was not armed, although sometimes light machine guns and small bombs were fitted. It was ordered in large quantities following the outbreak of the First World War with the Caudron factories building 1423 of the 2450 built in France. 233 were also built in England and 166 built in Italy along with several other countries. The Caudron brothers did not charge a licensing fee for the design, as an act of patriotism. It was followed in production by the Caudron G.4, which was a twin-engined development. It also has a maximum of 66mph or 80hp ==Operational history== French operational Caudron G.3 Caudron G.3 operated by the American 800th Aero Squadron as a trainer Caudron G.3 floatplane trainer in Chinese service The G.3 equipped Escadrille C.11 of the French Aéronautique Militaire at the outbreak of war, and was well-suited for reconnaissance use, proving stable and having good visibility. As the war progressed, its low performance and lack of armament made it too vulnerable for front line service, and it was withdrawn from front line operations in mid-1916. The Italians also used the G.3 for reconnaissance on a wide scale until 1917, as did the British RFC (continuing operations until October 1917), who fitted some with light bombs and machine guns for ground attack. The Australian Flying Corps operated the G.3 during the Mesopotamian campaign of 1915–16. It continued in use as a trainer until well after the end of the war. Chinese Fengtian clique warlord Caudron G.3s remained in service as trainers until the Mukden Incident of 1931, when many were captured by the Japanese. In 1921 Adrienne Bolland, a French test pilot working for Caudron, made the first crossing of the Andes by a woman, flying between Argentina and Chile in a G.3. ==Variants== Most G.3s were the A2 model, used by various airforces for artillery spotting on the Western front, in Russia and in the Middle East. The G.3 D2 was a two-seat trainer, equipped with dual controls and the E2 was a basic trainer. The R1 version (rouleur or roller) was used by France and the United States Air Service for taxi training, with the wing trimmed down to prevent its becoming airborne. The last version, the G.3. L2, was equipped with a more powerful Anzani 10 radial engine. In Germany, Gotha built a few copies of the G.3 as the Gotha LD.3 and Gotha LD.4 (Land Doppeldecker – \\"Land Biplane\\"). ==Survivors and reproductions== Caudron G.3s are displayed in several museums, including at the RAF Museum Hendon, the Musée de l'Air et de l'Espace, Paris, the Royal Army and Military History Museum, Brussels and the Aerospace Museum (Musal), Rio de Janeiro. One aircraft is being restored at the Hallinportti Aviation Museum in Finland.

Though a replica visually accurate in dimensions and appearance, it was built on an ultralight basis. The project development began in 2009, and the replica was closely based on a Caudron G.3 displayed in the Musée de l’air et de l’espace in Le Bourget, Paris. ==Operators== Caudron G.3 in the Airspace Museum (Museu Aeroespacial) in Rio de Janeiro.

DUMBA (a feminized version of DUMBO-- Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass, the name of its NYC neighborhood) became a radical cultural nexus point around which the QueercoreTrebay, Guy. \\"Queers in Space: DUMBA Takes Off\\", Village Voice, May 12, 1999. movement flourished and an independent film scene developed. It was the site of many notable events, as well as being a residence for a few dozen people over the years. DUMBA was a unique experiment providing a combination of live music and disc jockeys (usually several DJs a night), film screenings of Super 8 and 16mm films, video, artwork, performances, vegetarian food, and an unrestricted erotic atmosphere. == Background and history == DUMBA was founded in a loft, during the summer of 1996 by a group of people which included filmmaker Scott Berry, Kelly Besser, Vincent Baker, and others. It would come to call itself the \\"DUMBA Collective\\" by around 2000. The group's name, DUMBA, is derived from DUMBO, the neighborhood between Fulton Landing and Vinegar Hill. The loft used for the collective's space was commercially zoned under the Manhattan Bridge overpass and housed six or seven residents between the years 1996 and 2006. It has been described as \\"a maze of rooms small and large\\".Taormino, Tristan. \\"Queer Co-Ed Lust\\", Village Voice, August 29, 2001. DUMBA lost its lease to the loft in 2006. == Projects and Productions == DUMBA first became known for putting on all-ages punk shows, which were promoted by word of mouth and simple photocopied flyers displaying a DIY aesthetic. Diana Morrow designed several of the flyers. Bands and performers who played DUMBA include The Need, Los Crudos, Limp Wrist, Nedra Johnson, The Spaceheads, Bitch and Animal, Octant, God Is My Co-Pilot, Tribe 8, Three Dollar Bill, Kaia, Patsy, The Lookers, and many more. In time, the venue began to feature more diverse performances by artists such as Vaginal Davis. === Fuck the Mayor Collective === DUMBA was also involved in the Fuck the Mayor Collective, a queer activist organization created in response to what some believed were the racist, classist, sexist, and homophobic policies of the Giuliani administration.Chadburn, Allissa. \\"The problem with Pride\\", San Francisco Bay Guardian, June 26, 2002 In 1998, DUMBA and the Fuck the Mayor Collective created Gay Shame, a controversial anti-assimilationist and anti-consumerism response to the annual Gay Pride celebrations during June. Kiki and Herb and Three Dollar Bill performed, and Eileen Myles, Mattilda aka Matt Bernstein Sycamore, and Penny Arcade spoke at the event that year, which was filmed by Scott Berry and released as the documentary film Gay Shame 98. The event was written about by Alissa Chadburn in the San Francisco Bay Guardian: > The goal of Gay Shame in New York was to form a free \\"non-consumerist space > for creating culture and community building\\" and to try to \\"build some > opposition to the reactionary gay mainstream,\\" which [Mattilda] says has \\"a > stranglehold on all representations of queerness in the media. The collective behind Gay Shame also produced a fanzine each year for the occasion of the event, entitled Swallow Your Pride. Gay Shame was held at DUMBA in June 1998 and June 2000 (June 17, 2000). === Queeruption, 1999 === The second iteration of Queeruption, an annual international Queercore festival, was largely housed at DUMBA October 7-11, 1999. Hundreds of activists came from across the United States and Europe for this free, radical, queer \\"encuentro\\" that was part skill-share, part social event, and part conference, and that featured over 60 workshops, along with films, performances, and parties. There was also a Columbus Day action in Central Park in which city vehicles were \\"ticketed\\" for parking on stolen land, and to protest the arrest of a gay man, allegedly for cruising in the park (he claimed to be urinating). === Brooklyn Babylon Cinema === Brooklyn Babylon Cinema, a recurring analog film screening series, was born at DUMBA and continued for several years. It featured events such as the \\"Times Square Sinema\\" on May 7, 1999, which provided a kissing booth and encouraged fraternization; a tribute to the Deuce's seedy past; and \\"Caught Looking\\" (March 2000), a program about voyeurism curated by Aaron Scott, which included two video programs, as well as installations by Rob Roth and others. Brooklyn Babylon Cinema regularly showed films by emerging directors, providing a space in which new work could develop, as well as work by better-known directors such as Sadie Benning, Anonymous Boy, G.B. Jones, Miranda July, and Scott Treleaven. === Lusty Loft Parties === From 2000 through 2002, DUMBA was home to the \\"Lusty Loft Parties,\\" described by writer and sex columnist Tristan Taormino as \\"pure queer erotic utopia, with people of all genders fucking side by side.\\"Taormino, Tristan. \\"Riding the Shortbus: Tristan recounts her experience as a \\"sextra\\" in the provocative indie flick\\", Village Voice, November 9, 2006.

The line ran between December 1999 and December 2004 and was released by Playmates Toys. The toy action figure series was called World of Springfield, because the concept of the line was for collectors to build a miniature Springfield through a series of interactive action figures and playsets. It eventually encompassed over 200 different figures and characters from the series, 40 interactive playsets (toy re- creations of Simpson's interior settings and town location settings within Springfield), and three non-interactive diorama town settings. ==History== From its release in December 1999 during a rise in the popularity of the animated sitcom, the Playmates Interactive World of Springfield figures immediately became a success by focusing in the show's growing supply of characters and providing interactive environments featuring audio clips from the show. The figures ranged from Blue-Haired Lawyer and Sarcastic Guy to well known characters such as Bart and Homer. The first wave of figures contained six figures and a set was sold for US$85 in November 2004. At that time, the Waylon Smithers figure from the second wave was considered rare and valued at US$20 and Glow-in-the-Dark-Radioactive Homer, which was distributed through a 2000 ToyFare magazine mail-in offer, is considered the rarest of the line. In 2002, Playmates released World of Springfield: Celebrity Simpsons playset. At that time, more than 50 figures and 12 playsets were already available. The Celebrity Simpsons set included Homer's half-brother Herb Powell, actor Troy McClure, and Fat Tony as five-inch-tall talking representations of Simpsons characters. To be included in the release, each was considered to have reached cult status in their popularity with viewers. The figures additionally included accessories to provide more interaction. For example, the Fat Tony character included a cigar and pistol, a wad of dough, and a baseball bat and could speak signature lines when placed on a specially designed stand. ==Level of success== The mass market appeal of The Simpsons encompasses everyone from young kids who loved the slapstick comedy to adults of all ages who appreciate that the jokes and situations that work on multiple levels of our intellect. Like other classic TV series, fans remember and quote the lines, and Playmates Toys managed to capture that appeal with its interactive playsets. Each figure came with its own \\"coded\\" chip generally set into the character's foot that when contacted with the \\"trigger\\" tab on each playset would complete the circuit so by then pressing a nearby button, you would hear playback of one to five phrases for that character. Unique features included audio playback from the show and the actual voice actor; placing the Homer Simpson figure on an appropriate playset would trigger the playback of a quote as performed by Dan Castellaneta on the original episode. Each playset held quotes and voice clip performances for a variety of characters so that placing the Marge Simpson figure or the Bart figure would trigger different quotes and voice clips. One limitation was that not every character worked with every playset — some for story logic reasons (character might not appear at that setting), release logistics (figures released long after a playset) or presumably for cost reasons (as each voice clip had to be approved and licensed). The sets were released during the dot-com bubble and a healthy economic environment in the United States. The figures themselves cost between $5.99 USD and $7.99 USD each, while the playsets generally ranged from $20 USD to $25 USD at the end of 2004. There were also special releases that were in the $60 USD range. Even at minimal retail, 200+ figures and 40 playsets meant a large financial commitment. In addition, there were a dozen exclusives and mail-in figures that required extra work to obtain the figures — often via an online auction. However, the early success of the series and the healthy economy added extra momentum to the line for a few more years. ==The line end== The line ended in mid-2004 due to a number of factors, most importantly slow sales. Other factors include \\"collectors fatigue\\", the release pattern of the figures, the sheer size of the line being difficult for newcomers, the slowing economy, the changing toy retail situation, and Playmates Toys' relationship with 20th Century Fox. ==List of figures and playsets== ==Vehicles== Technically not part of World of Springfield, these vehicles were made by Playmates Toys in June 2001 and in August 2002, and are considered part of the line by some fans. The vehicles did not interact with the other World of Springfield items, and weren't actually able to hold any figures from the line, but by moving the characters that came with the vehicle to the right or the left or by pressing the car's hood a conversation could be created between the characters. *Family Car with Homer, Marge, Bart, Santa's Little Helper, Lisa, and Maggie. Release date: June 2001 *School Bus with Martin, Milhouse, Ralph, Bart, Lisa and Otto. Release date: August 2002 ==KayBee Toys exclusive== In August 2002 Playmates Toys released a series of figures through the retail store KB Toys based on the \\"When Bongos Collide\\" storyline from Bongo Comics. It featured Simpsons characters transformed into superheroes. The initial three-pack of figures included Homer Simpson as the Indigestible Bulk, Apu as Captain Kwik, and Ms. Krabappel as Vampiredna. Two more three-packs were planned (featuring Marge as the Entangler, Lisa as the Jazzler, Maggie as Brainbaby, Grampa as Oldblood member Coma, and Skinner as The Stickler, and Willie as the Plaid Piper), but the line was cancelled as soon as it hit retail. ==Cancelled items== As in most toy lines, items are planned for release that for a number of reasons (cost issues, low retailer interest) never end up being produced and/or released. Many items were cancelled from the World of Springfield line; a complete list is available in the Simpsons Collector Sector's Release Guide. - Link no longer valid ===Cancelled figures=== *Rabbi Krustofsky - Was to be include in the Series 2 line of Celebrity Figures, but was cancelled, supposedly because Jackie Mason withdrew his approval. *Lyle Lanley - Originally part of the Series 3 line of Celebrity Figures, but was replaced by Cooder. *Molloy - Originally part of Series 12, but was replaced by Number One. Was cancelled when the World of Springfield line ended. Was going to be part of the Mail Away figures. *Cecil Terwilliger, Sideshow Bob's brother - Voiced by David Hyde Pierce.

Generally speaking napakivi are unhewn stones that people have set upright. Some of them may have been erected by withdrawal of the receding ice-masses after the ice-age, in which case they will not be napakivi proper. Napakivi are usually longish and erect, and frequently have a round head. This has been interpreted by some to perhaps indicate an omphalos/penile reference symbolically. Napakivi can be located in the middle of a field, or the heart of an adjacent pile of stones which will be compiled of stones which had to be removed from the field to make it cultivatable by a plough. It can also be the central stone of a burial mound. Napakivi may have been considered facilitators of fertility or protectors of domain, or they may have been legal indidcators of ownership. It is plausible they may have been considered some kind of magical centres of force or energy accumulators; perhaps the seat of a tutelary spirits power. The name tonttukivi refers to the elfs known as tonttu and also to the Finnish language word for a plot of land \\"tontti\\". Some stones equivalent to napakivi have been referred to with the term Juminkeko or Jumin kurikka, in which case they will have been connected to the mysterious spirit known as Jumi, who served as the basis for the Finnish word for god. Napakivi may have some cultural connection with saami seids or central European and great British megaliths, although it has not been demonstrated with any scientific rigour. Megaliths too are erected by ancient folk, giant, usually over man high stones which are sole or in groups. Most megaliths as well are considered to have a connexion to the penis and fertility. A stone in the center of a graveyard set up at the end of battle to inter the combatants is often called a napakivi, in which case the attendant mythology described above will not be attached to it. == External links == * Tonttukivet Merikarvian Trolssin kylässä. kansanperinne.net Category:Stones Category:Archaeological sites in Finland Category:Finnish mythology ","title":"Napakivi"},{"id":"9069561","text":"Frances Tustin (born Frances Daisy Vickers; 1913 in Northern England) was a pioneering child psychotherapist renowned for her work with children with autism in the 1950s.

As a child Froggatt, who was delicate, was encouraged by his mother to find interests in the open air and at an early age began collecting insects. The family having moved to Bendigo, Victoria he was educated at the Corporate High School, Sandhurst (Bendigo), and on leaving school spent four years on the land. In 1880 he went to a goldfield near Milparinka, New South Wales, and then worked his way northward and through Queensland to Mackay, Herberton, Cairns and other parts of the colony. Wherever he went he kept up his collecting of insects. ==Career as entomologist== In 1883 Froggatt returned to Bendigo, worked with his father on a lease near Mount Hope, and around this time contacted Charles French Senior and Baron von Mueller. It was partly through Mueller's good offices that Froggatt was appointed entomologist and assistant zoologist to the expedition sent to New Guinea in 1885 by the Geographical Society of Australasia. The party left in June 1885 and returned on 4 December 1885. Early in 1886 Froggatt was engaged by William Macleay as a collector. He at once proceeded to North Queensland and formed large collections. In March 1887 he went to north-west Australia, began collecting in the Derby district and later in the more inland country. He returned to Derby after severe attacks of fever and then went to the Barrier Range to recover his health. Returning to the coast he took steamer on 22 February 1888 for Fremantle and thence to Sydney, where he arrived on 31 March 1888. Froggatt then went to England at the invitation of an uncle and gained much experience in European museums and universities. On his return he worked at the Macleay museum until it was transferred to the university, and in 1889 was appointed assistant and collector at the Sydney technological museum. From 1890 the first of a long series of papers by him was published in the Proceedings of the Linnean Society of New South Wales. Froggatt was a founder in 1891 and later president for a record eleven years of the Naturalists' Society of New South Wales. In 1896 he was appointed government entomologist to the agricultural department of New South Wales. Froggatt’s work was not confined to entomology, he was also vine inspector and later inspector under the vegetation diseases act. In the many papers he was writing at this time there is an increasing tendency for his attention to be given to insect pests. He published Australian Insects in 1907, the first comprehensive text-book on Australian entomology, and in this year was sent abroad to study the best ways of dealing with fruit flies, etc. His Report on Parasitic and Injurious Insects was published by the New South Wales department of agriculture in 1909. Also in 1909 he went to the Solomon Islands to report on pests attacking coconut palms and sugar-cane, and in 1913 went on a similar mission to the New Hebrides. From 1911 to 1921 he lectured at the University of Sydney. During the war he spent much time on the control of weevils in stored wheat, and in 1922 investigated pests attacking banana-trees in Queensland. He retired from the department of agriculture in 1923 but was forest entomologist in the department of forestry until his final retirement on 31 March 1927. His volume on Forest Insects of Australia was published in 1923; in the following four years many papers on forest entomology were also published, and in 1927 another volume, Forest Insects and Timber Borers, appeared. ==Late life and legacy== Froggatt’s son John Lewis Froggatt, also an entomologist In Froggatt’s last years he did much writing on popular science in the Sydney Morning Herald, in 1933 his The Insect Book, the first of a series of elementary \\"Nature Books\\" for children, was published at Sydney, and in 1935 Australian Spiders and Their Allies appeared. During his final years, Froggatt was the only solid public opponent of the ultimately disastrous introduction of the poisonous cane toad into Queensland to control beetle pests in sugar cane – a view which cost him many supporters in the CSIR, among fellow economic entomologists (e.g. the HSPA's Cyril Pemberton) and even in the newspapers of the day.Turvey, Nigel; Cane toads: A tale of sugar, politics and flawed science; pp. 89–91, 144–147 He died at Croydon, New South Wales, on 18 March 1937 and was cremated with Anglican rites. He married Ann Emily, daughter of John Lewis, in 1890, and was survived by a son, John Lewis Froggatt, entomologist to the Mandated Territory of New Guinea, and two daughters. One of the daughters, Gladys Harding Froggatt, was the author of The World of Little Lives (1916), and More About the World of Little Lives (1929). Froggatt was a member of the council of the Linnean Society of New South Wales for 40 years, president from 1911 to 1913. He gave enthusiastic support to the various scientific societies with which he was connected, and was much interested in the planting of Australian trees and in gardening generally. He had a fine collection of books on science and general literature. His collection of insects was acquired by the Commonwealth government and is now at Canberra. He was a leading Australian entomologist and an untiring worker; Musgrave lists over 300 of his papers in his Bibliography. In addition to his books on entomology, Froggatt also published a volume on Some Useful Australian Birds in 1921. Froggatt specialised in Scale insects (Coccoidea). ==Works== Partial list * Notes on Australian Cynipidae, with descriptions of several new species. Proc. Linn. Soc. N. S.

The game is a two-dimensional action game with platforming elements, starring Rolo the elephant. Several other animal characters are playable once Rolo rescues them. ==Premise and gameplay== In-game screenshot In Rolo to the Rescue the player controls, Rolo, a young elephant. The objective is to traverse through levels with varying terrain, rescue Rolo's captive friends along the way and his mother from the circus. Players can move Rolo left to right and can make Rolo jump. Power ups can give Rolo unique abilities. For example, obtaining a water sprayer allows Rolo to shoot water out of his trunk, a vacuum allows him to suck in small objects into his trunk and shoot it out, a helium tank allows Rolo to be filled with air and float in the air, and a washing machine allows Rolo to shrink and reach areas inaccessible at normal size. Levels are shown in a map from a top-down perspective and designed in the shape of a jigsaw puzzle board. Unlocked levels are revealed as jigsaw puzzle pieces and completed levels have animal paw prints stamped on them. Levels are completed by unlocking and reaching the goal. Goals are represented by sign posts and when they are unlocked, a compass rose will appear on the goal. The goal's primary method of being unlocked is by defeating the Ring Master and obtaining his key and freeing all the caged animal friends within the level. Some levels provide alternate methods for unlocking goals like obtaining a hidden puzzle piece somewhere within the level or reaching an alternate goal post. These alternate methods unlock more additional levels. Once a captive animal is rescued, it will join Rolo's party with a maximum of three animal companions. If more than three are rescued, the earliest recruited animal companion that joined will leave the party and be replaced by the latest. Players can switch between the animal companions. Each animal companion type has their own unique abilities. For example, the rabbit is able to jump very high, the squirrel can climb, the mole can dig, and the beaver can swim. When an animal party member is being controlled, Rolo and the other remaining companions will be idle. if the animal companion takes damage under control of the player, it will faint and the party and be switched immediately back to Rolo. if Rolo receives damage and has party member, he will lose a party member instead. if Rolo receives damage without a party member he will lose a life instead. ==Reception== MegaTech awarded the game 89%,MegaTech rating, EMAP, issue 22, page 99, October 1993 while Mega placed the game at #31 in their Top Mega Drive Games of All Time.Mega issue 26, page 74, Maverick Magazines, November 1994 ==References== ==External links== *Guides at GameFAQs *Good Ending Video – Rolo to the Rescue * Category:1992 video games Category:Electronic Arts games Category:Fictional elephants Category:Side-scrolling platform games Category:Sega Genesis-only games Category:Sega Genesis games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom ","title":"Rolo to the Rescue"},{"id":"9069618","text":"St John's Regional College is a Catholic co-educational secondary school located in Dandenong region in the south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. == College history == St John's Regional College began when the parish priests of the region recognised the need for a secondary boys' school in the area. There had been an increasing number of students who were continuing their education beyond primary school and many were required to travel considerable distances to access this education. St Mary's Primary School staffed by the Presentation Sisters had educated both girls and boys through Prep to Grade 6 and for many into Form I and Form II. In 1957 after a successful approach to the De La Salle Brothers to staff a new school, St John's Boys School opened in 1958 with the Founding Principal Brother Amedy Molloy. Initially the first classes taught on February 4, 1958, Grade 6, Form I and Form II were in classrooms at St Mary's. Amedy had charge of Form 1 and Form II in one room with 38 and 13 students respectively and J F Maher took over the Grade 6 with 69 students. It was not long until the new school moved 'across the road' into their own building. It was just a tin shed on the site for the new building, with 120 boys, and students were called to class by a bell hanging in a gum tree. In the ensuing years St John's Boys School continued to grow. The ground floor of new brick building in New Street was completed in 1959, with the second floor completed in 1960. In 1965 it was recognised that St John's Boys School needed a new location and was serving a much wider area. In 1966, for the first time, St John's was a regional college serving the parishes of St Mary's Dandenong, St Gerard's North Dandenong, St Anthony's Noble Park, Holy Family Doveton, St Paul Apostle (North and South) Endeavour Hills and St Michael's Berwick. In late November 1967 the new buildings in Caroline Street Dandenong were officially opened and blessed by Archbishop Knox, and in on the first day of school in 1968 Form I – VI boys began life at the then new and now current location of St John's. The Grade 5 and Grade 6 boys who had been part of St John's Boys School now returned to be part of St Mary's School. The secondary girls at St Mary's became St Mary's Girls Secondary College (1968) and later the same year changed name to St Angela's (in honour of Angela Burke, one of the founding Presentation Sisters in Dandenong). 1968 saw the sharing of resources/teachers between St Angela's and St John's, particularly for Matriculation classes. In 1970 the decision was made to amalgamate St John's and St Angela's, and in 1971 Senior co- education classes were conducted on the Caroline Street site as well as Junior and Middle Secondary Boys' classes. The Junior and Middle Secondary Girls' classes remained at St Angela's on their McCrae Street site until the last year of St Angela's 1973. In 1974 the whole College was on one campus and was known as St John's Regional College. Senior, Form V and VI, classes were co-ed and Form I – IV were separate boys' and girls' classes and in fact housed completely separately. During 1976 much discussion was held regarding full co- education and in 1977 the first Catholic co-educational regional college in the nation was born. This development coincided with significant enrolment increases. Further needs for Catholic Secondary education in the region saw the establishment of St Francis Xavier College Beaconsfield in 1978 and Nazareth College Noble Park North in 1985. With the establishment of these Colleges the regional parishes to whom St John's served was also changed. Some of this change was also due to the establishment of new parishes in the region. An refurbishment program commenced in 2016 with the provision of improved contemporary learning spaces, sporting facilities and a new Learning Common evolving from the former Education Resource Centre (Library). A range of upgraded and new passive and active outdoor recreation spaces have also been included. To be completed in early 2017, the learning spaces being created will also feature a new Community Garden with outdoor classrooms. Providing links to the local community and Dandenong Market the Eagle Community Garden will provide structured workplace learning opportunities for students in Year 9 and 10 as well as Horticulture / Agriculture Studies in the senior year levels. The outdoor classrooms and Eagle Community Garden will also provide further curriculum opportunities across a range of learning areas from Years 7 through 12. Throughout 2017, the College will undertake an extensive consultation with families, parishes, students and the community on a new masterplan. == House system == In 2008 St John's established a vertical House System which operates from Year 7 to Year 12. * Each House consists of seven Homeroom Groups, which consist of approximately 5 students from each of the 7 – 12 year levels. * Each House has coordinator who is responsible for the overall development of each individual's sense of belonging, loyalty and spirit in his/her House, as well as for administrative tasks. * Each Homeroom Group is immediately cared for by the Homeroom teacher. As much as possible, the same Homeroom teacher will remain with the students throughout their enrolment at the College. * Family members are placed in the same House but not usually in the same Homeroom Group. * The Homeroom Groups meet for 18 minutes each morning. * On different occasions, greater amounts of time are spent on House functions and House assemblies to give students an opportunity to gather together to acknowledge student achievement and foster House spirit. The House Coordinators oversee pastoral care of the students in their care. Dimensions of pastoral care include: * pastoral care programs; * appropriate behaviour of students; * the correct wearing of Uniform; * late arrivals and absenteeism of students; * student progress; * student subject selection and transition; * student promotion; and * conducting meetings and organising House activities with the House Leaders and Homeroom Representatives == College Principals == *Amedy Molloy 1958 – 1969 *Domenic Della Bosca 1970 – 1975 *Leo Scollen 1976 – 1982 *Kevin Maloney 1983 – 1987 *Michael Quin 1988 – 1991 *Patrick Power 1992– 2008 *Andrew Walsh 2009 – 2016 *Brendan Watson 2016 – end of 2016 (interim Principal) *Tim Hogan 2017 – ==Notable alumni== *Stephen Allan – professional golfer *Andrew Bogut – basketball player (Golden State Warriors) *Daniela Di Toro – wheelchair tennis player *Frank Drmic – basketball player *Peter Filipovic - CEO of Carlton & United Brewerieshttps://cub.com.au/new-cub-chief-executive-officer-and-executive- chairman/ *Digby Ioane – rugby union player (The Wallabies, Queensland Reds) *Scott McDonald – soccer player (Celtic F.C., Middlesbrough F.C., Socceroos) *Geraldine Quinn – comedian *Adam Ramanauskas – Australian rules footballer (Essendon Football Club) *Paul Wade - captain of the Socceroos, Australia's national football team. *Majak Mawith - Professional soccer player ==References== ==External links== *Official website Dandenong Category:1958 establishments in Australia Category:Catholic secondary schools in Victoria (Australia) Category:Educational institutions established in 1958 Category:Dandenong, Victoria ","title":"St John's Regional College"},{"id":"9069638","text":"Shereen Bhan (born 20 August 1976) is an Indian journalist and news anchor.Shereen’s Momenthttp://www.rediff.com/getahead/2007/oct/29shereen.htm She is the Managing Editor of CNBC-TV18.

TURF analysis identifies the number of users reached by a communication, and how often they are reached. Although originally used by media schedulers to maximize reach and frequency of media spending across different items (print, broadcast, etc.), TURF is also now used to provide estimates of market potential. For example, if a company plans to market a new yogurt, they may consider launching ten possible flavors, but in reality, only three might be purchased in large quantities. The TURF algorithm identifies the optimal product line to maximize the total number of consumers who will purchase at least one SKU. Typically, when TURF is undertaken for optimizing a product range, the analysis only looks at the reach of the product range (ignoring the Frequency component of TURF). In order to obtain data on the items being evaluated, ratings/choices may be obtained via quantitative marketing research (such as a survey).\\"dailyscrawl\\", market research tools, November 19, 2019 == External links == *P-STAT, a software for TURF Analysis.

It later became a secondary modern school. Extensions were made to the original site in 1948 and 1957. In 1960, Minchenden School took over the buildings in Fox Lane, Palmers Green that had been vacated by the move of Southgate County School to its current site in Sussex Way, Cockfosters. The Arnos School buildings were further extended in 1964 and 1966. It became a comprehensive school in 1967 with the feeder schools Bowes, Garfield, Oakthorpe, Our Lady of Lourdes Roman Catholic, and St. Michael's Church of England primary schools, and some further extensions were made in 1967, 1969, and 1972. In 1984,Enfield Council: Secondary Schools, a history Accessed 4 June 2007 Arnos School and Minchenden School were merged to form a new school, located at the Arnos School premises and named Broomfield School. Broomfield is still a comprehensive school and in 2008 received designation as a specialist humanities college. It was, at one time, one of the largest secondary schools in the Borough of Enfield, due to its location near the borders of the neighbouring boroughs of Haringey and Barnet, but since the development of Alexandra Park School in Haringey in 2003, it has steadily lost pupils from its feeder primary schools. An OFSTED inspection in October 2011 judged the school to be inadequate and placed it into special measures. A new leadership group was appointed to turn the school around, and, in 2013, the school came out of special measures. In May 2015, the school was judged by Ofsted to be a 'good' school.http://reports.ofsted.gov.uk/inspection-reports/find-inspection- report/provider/ELS/102056 The local authority closed its sixth form provision due to falling numbers, after the school had spent a substantial amount of money developing a new sixth form block.

It was launched on a PSLV-XL on 28 September 2015. With the success of this satellite, ISRO has proposed launching AstroSat-2 as a successor for Astrosat.Isro plans to launch India's 2nd space observatory Times of India 19 February 2018 ==Overview== After the success of the satellite-borne Indian X-ray Astronomy Experiment (IXAE), which was launched in 1996, the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) approved further development for a full- fledged astronomy satellite, Astrosat, in 2004. A number of astronomy research institutions in India, and abroad have jointly built instruments for the satellite. Important areas requiring coverage include studies of astrophysical objects ranging from nearby solar system objects to distant stars and objects at cosmological distances; timing studies of variables ranging from pulsations of hot white dwarfs to those of active galactic nuclei can be conducted with Astrosat as well, with time scales ranging from milliseconds to days. Astrosat is a multi-wavelength astronomy mission on an IRS-class satellite into a near- Earth, equatorial orbit. The five instruments on board cover the visible (320–530 nm), near UV (180–300 nm), far UV (130–180 nm), soft X-ray (0.3–8 keV and 2–10 keV) and hard X-ray (3–80 keV and 10–150 keV) regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Astrosat was successfully launched on 28 September 2015 from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre on board a PSLV-XL vehicle at 10:00AM. ==Mission== Artist's conception of a binary star system with one black hole and one main sequence star alt= Astrosat is a proposal-driven general purpose observatory, with main scientific focus on: * Simultaneous multi-wavelength monitoring of intensity variations in a broad range of cosmic sources * Monitoring the X-ray sky for new transients * Sky surveys in the hard X-ray and UV bands * Broadband spectroscopic studies of X-ray binaries, AGN, SNRs, clusters of galaxies, and stellar coronae * Studies of periodic and non-periodic variability of X-ray sources Astrosat performs multi-wavelength observations covering spectral bands from radio, optical, IR, UV, and X-ray wavelengths. Both individual studies of specific sources of interest and surveys are undertaken. While radio, optical, and IR observations would be coordinated through ground-based telescopes, the high energy regions, i.e., UV, X-ray and visible wavelength, would be covered by the dedicated satellite- borne instrumentation of Astrosat. The mission would also study near simultaneous multi-wavelength data from different variable sources. In a binary system, for example, regions near the compact object emit predominantly in the X-ray, with the accretion disc emitting most of its light in the UV/optical waveband, whereas the mass of the donating star is brightest in the optical band. The observatory will also carry out: * Low- to moderate- resolution spectroscopy over a wide energy band with the primary emphasis on studies of X-ray-emitting objects * Timing studies of periodic and aperiodic phenomena in X-ray binaries * Studies of pulsations in X-ray pulsars * Quasi- periodic oscillations, flickering, flaring, and other variations in X-ray binaries * Short- and long-term intensity variations in active galactic nuclei * Time-lag studies in low/hard X-rays and UV/optical radiation * Detection and study of X-ray transients. In particular, the mission will train its instruments at active galactic nuclei, which are believed to contain super- massive black holes. ==Payloads== right The scientific payload contains six instruments. * The Ultra Violet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) performs imaging simultaneously in three channels: 130–180 nm, 180–300 nm, and 320–530 nm. The three detectors are vacuum image intensifiers manufactured by Photek, UK. The FUV detector consists of a CsI photocathode with a MgF input optic, the NUV detector consists of CsTe photocathode with a fused-silica input optic and the visible detector consists of an alkali-antimonide photocathode with a fused- silica input optic. The field of view is a circle of ~28′ diameter and the angular resolution is 1.8\\" for the ultraviolet channels and 2.5″ for the visible channel. In each of the three channels a spectral band can be selected through a set of filters mounted on a wheel; in addition, for the two ultraviolet channels a grating can be selected in the wheel to do slitless spectroscopy with a resolution of ~100. The primary mirror diameter of the telescope is 40 cm. * The Soft X-ray imaging Telescope (SXT) employs focusing optics and a deep depletion CCD camera at the focal plane to perform X-ray imaging in the 0.3–8.0 keV band. The optics will consist of 41 concentric shells of gold-coated conical foil mirrors in an approximate Wolter-I configuration (the effective area of 120 cm2). The focal plane CCD camera will be very similar to that flown on SWIFT XRT. The CCD will be operated at a temperature of about −80 °C by thermoelectric cooling. * The LAXPC Instrument covers X-ray timing and low-resolution spectral studies over a broad energy band (3–80 keV), Astrosat will use a cluster of 3 co-aligned identical Large Area X-ray Proportional Counters (LAXPCs), each with a multi-wire-multi-layer configuration and a Field of View of 1° × 1°. These detectors are designed to achieve (I) wide energy band of 3–80 keV, (II) high detection efficiency over the entire energy band, (III) narrow field of view to minimize source confusion, (IV) moderate energy resolution, (V) small internal background and (VI) long lifetime in space. The effective area of the telescope is 6000 cm2. * The Cadmium Zinc Telluride Imager (CZTI) is a hard X-ray imager. It will consist of a Pixellated Cadmium-Zinc-Telluride detector array of 500 cm2 effective area and the energy range from 10 to 150 kev. The detectors have a detection efficiency close to 100% up to 100 keV, and have a superior energy resolution (~2% at 60 keV) compared to scintillation and proportional counters. Their small pixel size also facilitates medium resolution imaging in hard x-rays. The CZTI will be fitted with a two dimensional coded mask, for imaging purposes. The sky brightness distribution will be obtained by applying a deconvolution procedure to the shadow pattern of the coded mask recorded by the detector. Apart from spectroscopic studies, CZTI would be able to do sensitive polarization measurements for bright galactic X-ray sources in 100–300 keV. * The Scanning Sky Monitor (SSM) consists of three position sensitive proportional counters, each with a one-dimensional coded mask, very similar in design to the All Sky Monitor on NASA's RXTE satellite. The gas- filled proportional counter will have resistive wires as anodes. The ratio of the output charge on either ends of the wire will provide the position of the x-ray interaction, providing an imaging plane at the detector. The coded mask, consisting of a series of slits, will cast a shadow on the detector, from which the sky brightness distribution will be derived. * The Charged Particle Monitor (CPM) will be included as a part of Astrosat payloads to control the operation of the LAXPC, SXT and SSM. Even though the orbital inclination of the satellite will be 8 deg or less, in about 2/3 of the orbits, the satellite will spend a considerable time (15–20 minutes) in the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) region which has high fluxes of low energy protons and electrons. The high voltage will be lowered or put off using data from CPM when the satellite enters the SAA region to prevent damage to the detectors as well as to minimize ageing effect in the Proportional Counters. ==Ground support== The Ground Command and Control Center for Astrosat is the ISRO Telemetry, Tracking and Command Network (ISTRAC) at Bangalore, India. Command and control of the spacecraft, and scientific data downloads is possible during every visible pass over Bangalore. 10 out of 14 orbits per day are visible to the ground station. The satellite is capable of gathering 420 gigabits of data every day that can be downloaded during the 10 visible orbits by the Tracking and Data receiving center of ISRO in Bangalore. A third 11-meter antenna at the Indian Deep Space Network (IDSN) became operational in July 2009 to track Astrosat. ==AstroSat Support Cell== ISRO has set up a support cell for AstroSat at IUCAA, Pune. A MoU was signed between ISRO and IUCAA in May 2016. The support cell has been set up to give opportunity to the scientific community in making proposals on processing and usage of AstroSat data. The support cell will provide necessary resource materials, tools, training and help to the guest observers. == Participants == The Astrosat project is a collaborative effort of many different research institutions. The participants are: * Indian Space Research Organization * Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai * Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bangalore * Raman Research Institute, Bangalore * Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics, Pune * Physical Research Laboratory, Ahmedabad * Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Mumbai * S.N. Bose National Centre for Basic Sciences, Kolkata * Presidency University, Kolkata * Canadian Space Agency * University of Leicester ==Timeline== * 29 Sep 2020: The satellite completed its mission life of 5 years and will continue to remain operational for many years. * 28 Sep 2018: The satellite has completed 3 years since its launch on 2015. It has observed over 750 sources and resulted in close to 100 publications in peer-reviewed journals. *15 April 2016: The satellite has completed its performance verification and started its operations. * 28 Sep 2015: ASTROSAT has been successfully launched into orbit. * 10 Aug 2015: All tests passed. Pre- shipment review successfully completed. * 24 July 2015: Thermovac completed. Solar panels attached. Start of final vibration tests. * May 2015 : The integration of Astrosat is complete and final tests are under way. ISRO issued a press release stating that \\"The satellite is planned to be launched during the second half of 2015 by PSLV C-34 to a 650 km near equatorial orbit around the Earth.\\" * April 2009 : Scientists from Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) have completed the developmental phase of complex science payloads and have begun integrating them before delivery of the 1,650 kg satellite Astrosat. The challenges in the design of payloads and Attitude Control System have been overcome and in a recent review committee meeting, it was decided that the delivery of the payload to the ISRO Satellite Centre will begin from the middle of 2009 and continue until early 2010 to enable the launch of ASTROSAT in 2010 using ISRO workhorse PSLV-C34. Two of the instruments were harder to complete than expected. \\"The satellite’s soft x-ray telescope proved to be a huge challenge that took 11 years...\\" ==Results== A gamma-ray burst was detected by Astrosat on 5 January 2017. There was a confusion whether this event was related to the gravitational wave signal detected by LIGO from the black hole merger event GW170104 on 4 January 2017. Astrosat helped in distinguishing between the two events. The gamma-ray burst from 4 January 2017 was identified as a distinct supernova explosion that would form a black hole. Astrosat also captured the rare phenomenon of a 6 billion year old small star or blue straggler feeding off and sucking out the mass and energy of a bigger companion star. On 31 May 2017, Astrosat, Chandra X-ray Observatory and Hubble Space Telescope simultaneously detected a coronal explosion on the nearest planet-hosting star Proxima Centauri On 6 November 2017 Nature Astronomy published a paper from Indian astronomers measuring the variations of X-ray polarisation of the Crab Pulsar in the Taurus constellation.Phase-resolved X-ray polarimetry of the Crab pulsar with the AstroSat CZT Imager Nature Astronomy 6 November 2017India's space observatory accomplishes X-ray polarisation Times of India 6 November 2017 This study was a project conducted by scientists from Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai; the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre, Thiruvananthapuram; ISRO Satellite Centre Bengaluru; the Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics, Pune; and the Physical Research Laboratory, Ahmedabad. In July 2018, Astrosat has captured an image of a special galaxy cluster that is more than 800 million light years away from earth. Named abell 2256 the galaxy cluster is made of three separate cluster of galaxy that are all merging with one another to eventually form a single massive cluster in the future. The three massive cluster contain more than 500 galaxies and the cluster is almost 100 times larger and more than 1500 times massive as our own galaxy. On 26 September 2018, the archival data of AstroSat was publicly released. As of 28 September 2018, data from AstroSat has been cited in around 100 publications in refereed journals. This figure is expected to rise after the public release of data from AstroSat. == In popular culture == In 2019 a documentary titled Indian Space Dreams on developmental journey of Astrosat was released. ==See also== *AstroSat-2 *Indian Astronomical Observatory *Indian Space Research Organisation *List of space telescopes *Ultraviolet astronomy *X-ray astronomy == References == ==External links== * Astrosat * ISRO Category:2015 in India Category:Satellites of India Category:Space telescopes Category:Spacecraft launched in 2015 Category:Ultraviolet telescopes Category:X-ray telescopes Category:Spacecraft launched by PSLV rockets ","title":"Astrosat"},{"id":"9070024","text":"Conrad Philip Havord (13 April 1925 – 13 January 2016), known professionally as Conrad Phillips, was an English television and film actor.

He called himself 'Bill' in the navy because his shipmates kept ridiculing the name Conrad. His name wasn't changed to 'Phillips' until he started acting. His father had been using the name 'Conrad Phillips' as a pen name for his thriller writing, and suggested that his son use this as his stage name. In his autobiography, Conrad said that he regretted making that decision. He studied at RADA, and then appeared in repertory theatre and in the West End.

He descended from a family of respected noblemen and landowners, but his father found himself almost completely ruined, and had to sell all his property, including the family ancestral home. It seems that this event produced a strong mixed feeling of both affection and anger about his native region in Fernando, which would last for the rest of his life. In 1861 he entered the Spanish Navy Colegio Naval de San Fernando, and one year later he went, as midshipman, aboard the frigate Esperanza, the first of the long series of warships on which he would serve his nation until the final Furor. He then served in the Philippines and Cuba, the last remains of the Spanish Empire, and in 1873 he was back in Spain and was nominated as a teacher in the Naval School that the Spanish Navy held aboard a frigate anchored in the naval base of Ferrol. Along the following years Villaamil took advantage of the studying and writing opportunities presented by his new job, becoming one of the best known and respected Spanish Navy officers. ==The Destructor== Destructor In 1884, Villaamil was appointed Second Officer in the Ministry of the Navy. As such, he took the initiative of studying and designing a new class of warship intended to fight the then-new torpedo boats. Once he reached his conclusions on the subject, he obtained the agreement of the Minister of the Navy, Manuel Pezuela, and selected the British shipyards of James & George Thompson, in Clydebank to build the new vessel, beginning in late 1885. Villaamil was assigned to Great Britain to supervise the works and study the operating procedures of the British naval dockyards, as well as the new Engineers corps. On January 19, 1887, the Destructor, the first torpedo boat destroyer,Smith, Charles Edgar: A short history of naval and marine engineering. Babcock & Wilcox, ltd. at the University Press, 1937, page 263 was formally handed over to the Spanish Navy, with great expectations from the European naval community. On the 24 the ship, which had reached in the trials, weighed anchor in Falmouth, bounded for Vigo, with Villaamil in command. Twenty-four hours later, she reached the Spanish coast, making through a stormy Bay of Biscay.\\"The American Navy Greyhound\\" In one day the doubts about the ship's seaworthiness were answered forever, and her designer and commander had every reason to feel proud. As a consequence of the success of the Destructor, Villaamil's professional reputation grew, both in Spain and abroad. ==Around the world aboard the Nautilus== Fernando Villaamil and the Nautilus, 1894 Another view of the Nautilus The Furor during her sea trials Memorial to Villaamil erected in 1911 in Castropol Villaamil was a strong advocate of oceanic sailing as the best training for the young Navy officers and in 1892, being appointed commander of the corvette Nautilus he took advantage of the celebrations of the fourth centenary of America's discovery to get approval for an instruction cruise around the world, rounding the three Great Capes. On November 30, 1892 the Nautilus left Ferrol, in the northwest end of Spain. She rounded Cape Agulhas and Cape Leeuwin, passed through Bass and Cook straits, rounded Cape Horn, went to New York City and eventually, after sailing forty thousand miles, came back to Spain on a shining Sunday, July 16, 1894, in San Sebastián. Here the sailors suddenly realized that an approaching launch hoisted the royal pennant. It was the Regent Queen and her son, the child King Alfonso XIII, coming to welcome Villaamil and all the Nautilus crew. ==The Spanish–American War== During the following years, Villaamil and some other forward-thinking colleagues tried to make the Spanish public aware of the critical deficiencies of the Navy. Then, events rushed ahead: tension with the United States was rising quickly, and on February 16, 1898—the day following the explosion of the USS Maine in Havana—Villaamil was appointed Chief of the First Division of torpedo boats and destroyers. Meanwhile, a totally unrealistic feeling of unbeatable naval power spread over Spain, and the Government decided that a whole fleet, commanded by Admiral Pascual Cervera, should be sent across the Atlantic, contrary to Cervera's and the Spanish Navy's own advice. Villaamil and his First Division left Cadiz on March 13, and on April 18 they gathered with Admiral Cervera's fleet in the Cape Verde islands. A month later, on April 24, the United States declared war on Spain, and Cervera received the order to go to the Antilles. Villaamil's Division was split, its destroyers integrated in Cervera's fleet, and the torpedo boats sent back to Spain. Thus, Villaamil was left with no very specific responsibilities. He could have returned to Spain, but he chose to go forward with his fellows, even though he was totally aware of the disaster the ill- prepared fleet was headed for. He was always in disagreement with both the Spanish Government's shaky war direction and Cervera's rather passive strategy. Instead, he advocated trying to offset the superiority of the American forces by scattering the fleet and taking the initiative through quick and dispersed daring actions; and he even volunteered to lead an audacious diversionary attack to New York with his destroyers, but his proposals were not accepted. Therefore, Villaamil had to resign himself unwillingly to be shut with all the fleet in the bay of Santiago de Cuba. In the end, on July 3 the whole Spanish fleet came out through the narrow mouth of the bay, ship by ship, with no chances of surviving the incoming battle with the US fleet. ==The end== Villaamil was killed on board one of his destroyers, the Furor. Francisco Arderius, officer in the ship, reported Fernando Villaamil's end: ==Notes== ==Sources== * Villaamil, Fernando. \\"Viaje de circunnavegación de la corbeta Nautilus\\".

The house, originally a 13th-century castle, was extensively altered during the 18th century by German architect Richard Cassels, starting in 1731 and finishing in 1741.Powerscourt House & Gardens A fire in 1974 left the house lying as a shell until it was renovated in 1996. The Wingfield family had long coveted the lands of Phelim O'Toole of Powerscourt (d. 1603), seeking to draw Phelim O'Toole into an act of rebellion, the penalty for which was forfeiture. The feud climaxed on the 14 May 1603 when the Wingfields murdered Phelim in the place known as the Killing Hollow near Powerscourt, despite the fact that Phelim's grandson and heir Turlough son of Phelim's son (d. 1616) remained in occupation of Powerscourt. King James I of England (d. 1625) on 27 October 1603 granted a lease of the manor of Powerscourt for 21 years to Sir Richard Wingfield for a rent of £6 Irish and a knight's fee. The reasons for the forfeiture of the O'Toole estates were because of the rebellious acts of Brian O'Neill (d. 1549) and Phelim O'Toole himself. That the actions of O'Brien, O'Neill and O'Toole, Lord of Kinelarty, were cited as a reason for forfeiture was bizarre given the fact that at least Phelim O'Toole received a posthumous pardon for unspecified offences on 23 April 1549. Furthermore, alongside Baron Cromwell his estates were surrendered to regrant. The awarded family seat of the Viscounts Powerscourt, the estate has been owned by the Slazenger family, founders and former owners of the Slazenger sporting goods business, since 1961. It is a popular tourist attraction, and includes Powerscourt Golf Club, an Avoca Handweavers restaurant, and an Autograph Collection Hotel. There is also Powerscourt House, Dublin, which was the townhouse of the viscount. == History  13th-century house === The original owner of the 13th-century castle was a man by the name of La Poer, which was eventually anglicised to \\"Power.\\" The castle's position was of strategic military importance because the castle's owner could control access to the nearby Dargle, Glencree and Glencullen rivers. The three-story house had at least 68 rooms. The entrance hall, where family heirlooms were displayed, was 18 metres (60 ft) long and 12 metres (40 ft) wide. The main reception rooms were on the first floor rather than on the ground floor, the more typical location. A mile-long avenue of beech trees leads to the house. === 18th-century house === Powerscourt House terrace & fountain (1800s) During the 16th century the house came into the ownership of the Powerscourt family. The family rose in wealth and prominence, and in the 18th century Richard Wingfield, 1st Viscount Powerscourt, commissioned the architect Richard Cassels to extensively alter and remodel the medieval castle to create a modern country house. Work started in 1731 and finished in 1741. On a commanding hilltop position, Cassels deviated slightly from his usual sombre style, giving the house something of what Sir John Vanbrugh would have called the 'castle air.' This is most noticeable in the structure's severe palladian facade bookended by two circular domed towers. The hall at Powerscourt House, circa 1890 King George IV was the guest of The 5th Viscount Powerscourt in August 1821. In the 1830s, the house was the venue for a number of conferences on unfulfilled Bible prophecies, which were attended by men such as John Nelson Darby and Edward Irving. These conferences were held under the auspices of Theodosia, Dowager Viscountess Powerscourt. Her letters and papers were republished in 2004, including summaries of the Powerscourt prophetic conferences. === 19th-century gardens === Japanese gardens at Powerscourt Estate In 1844, at the age of 8, Mervyn Wingfield, 7th Viscount Powerscourt, inherited the title and the Powerscourt Estate, which comprised 200 km² (49,000 acres) of land in Ireland. When young Lord Powerscourt reached the age of 21, he embarked on an extensive renovation of the house and created the new gardens. Main attractions on the grounds include the Tower Valley (with stone tower), Japanese gardens, winged horse statues, Triton Lake, pet cemetery, Dolphin Pond, walled gardens, Bamberg Gate and the Italian Garden. The Pepperpot Tower is said to be designed after a favoured 3-inch pepperpot of Lady Wingfield. Of particular note is the Pets Cemetery, whose tombstones have been described as \\"astonishingly personal\\". Inspiration for the garden design followed visits by Powerscourt to ornamental gardens at the Palace of Versailles, Schönbrunn Palace near Vienna, and Schwetzingen Castle near Heidelberg. The garden development took 20 years to complete in 1880. === 20th-century fire and renovation === The Triton Lake In 1961, the estate was sold by The 9th Viscount Powerscourt to the Slazenger family, who still own it to this day. Wendy Slazenger, daughter of the late Ralph Slazenger, married The Hon. Mervyn Wingfield (1935-2015) in 1962. Mervyn later succeeded, in 1973, as The 10th Viscount Powerscourt. Through her children, the 11th Viscount - Mervyn Anthony Wingfield - and the Hon. Julia Wingfield, there remains a strong connection between the two families and the Powerscourt Estate. The house was destroyed by fire on 4 November 1974 and was subsequently renovated in 1996. Only two rooms are open to the public as they once appeared while Powerscourt had residents, while the rest of ground floor and first floor are now retail units. In 2011, the Lonely Planet voted Powerscourt in the Top Ten Houses in the World while in 2014, National Geographic listed Powerscourt as No. 3 in the World's Top Ten Gardens. === 21st century ===  Tara's Palace Museum of Childhood  Tara's Palace Museum of Childhood relocated from Malahide Castle near Dublin to Powerscourt House in June 2011. The museum features dollhouses, miniatures, dolls, historic toys and Tara's Palace, one of the greatest dollhouses in the world, on a par with the Fairy Castle at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago, Illinois and Queen Mary's Dolls' House at Windsor Castle. and the Astolat Dollhouse Castle. == Waterfall == The waterfall Powerscourt Waterfall and its surrounding valley are also owned by the Powerscourt Estate, although the two pieces of land are no longer directly connected. At , it is the highest waterfall in Ireland. In 1858, The 7th Viscount Powerscourt established a deer park around the waterfall, resulting in the successful introduction of the Japanese Sika to Ireland. Regular bus service from Powerscourt to the waterfall was discontinued in 2005, though during the high summer season, intermittent bus services are still available. The waterfall is seven kilometres from Enniskerry, and walkable. While the distance is not prohibitive, walking can be dangerous, as the road is narrow, and lacks a shoulder for long stretches. A separate entrance fee is required for access to the waterfall, ranging from €3.50 (children) to €6 (adults). ==Golf Club== Powerscourt Golf Club, located at the Powerscourt Estate in County Wicklow, Ireland, is home to two par 72, 18-hole courses: the East, which was created first, and the West. Both contain fast greens and hilly fairways, and they are each over long. In 1998, the East Course was host to the Irish PGA Championship. == Popular culture == *The house was used as a filming location most famously in Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon, which was filmed there before the 1974 fire. *The Slazenger family invited Lynn Garrison to relocate his aerial film unit, aircraft collection and hangars, from Leixlip to the Powersourt airfield in 1973.

Since 1927, the borg is a historic house museum. == Mansion == Menkemaborg is an originally 14th-century, brick- built house, which was dramatically altered around 1700 but has since been barely changed. The Alberda family, the 18th-century occupants, commissioned artists to decorate the interior with impressive chimney-pieces carved with baroque ornaments, and paintings of mythological scenes. A four-poster bed, draped with yellow silk damask from China, has also been preserved. The rooms, which comprise reception rooms, the gentlemen's room, a study, dining room, bedroom, kitchen and cellars, are fully furnished with furniture, silverware, china, brassware and portrait paintings from the 17th and 18th centuries. == Gardens == The gardens were reconstructed after the surviving garden design dating from around 1705, and are marked by a clear layout with symmetrical patterns of clipped box enclosing beds of 18th-century flowering and ornamental plants. A particularly pretty part is the walled pleasure garden in front of the pavilion, with its trellised arches and arbours. The natural \\"sundial garden\\" is special too. To the east of the mansion is the utility area with a kitchen garden where vegetables and potherbs are grown and an orchard with ancient strains of apple trees and a pear-tree pergola.

He was the founder and subsequently co- editor of the scientific journal \\"Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research B\\". He has made important contributions to various fields of atomic physics and solid state physics, especially in the field of the stopping power of matter for fast charged particles. The accuracy (0.3–0.5%) of his measurements is unsurpassed even today (2006). They were done by measuring the amount of heat deposited in a foil at the temperature of liquid helium (−269 °C). Together with his collaborators, he succeeded in showing in 1969 that the stopping power for fast alpha particles is more than four times as large as that for protons. Since the atomic number (Z) of alpha particles is exactly twice as big as that of protons, that means that the stopping power is not exactly proportional to Z2, as the simple Bethe formula would have it. That was an additional proof of the existence of the Barkas effect. ==Literature== * * ==References== Category:1937 births Category:2012 deaths Category:Danish physicists Category:Danish nuclear physicists ","title":"Hans Henrik Andersen"},{"id":"9070249","text":"The Calgary Mavericks are a Canadian rugby union team based in Calgary, Alberta.

With tail drop, when the queue is filled to its maximum capacity, the newly arriving packets are dropped until the queue has enough room to accept incoming traffic. The name arises from the effect of the policy on incoming packets. Once a queue has been filled, the router begins discarding all additional datagrams, thus dropping the tail of the sequence of packets. The loss of packets causes the TCP sender to enter slow-start, which reduces throughput in that TCP session until the sender begins to receive acknowledgements again and increases its congestion window. A more severe problem occurs when datagrams from multiple TCP connections are dropped, causing global synchronization; i.e. all of the involved TCP senders enter slow-start. This happens because, instead of discarding many segments from one connection, the router would tend to discard one segment from each connection. ==See also== *Random early detection *Weighted random early detection ==Further reading== * .

He was born in Gloucester, England in 1782. He was the son of John Felton (1752-1796), an officer in the Royal Navy and Governor of the Balearic Islands, by his wife Elizabeth (1765-1833), daughter of John Butt. He was descended from the mentally disturbed Naval officer John Felton, who murdered George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham in 1628. The Feltons had a long association with the Royal Navy, and William too served with the British fleet in the Mediterranean and at Gibraltar during the Napoleonic Wars. In 1811, he married Anna Maria Valls at Menorca and in 1814 he was appointed British Consul at Livorno. He amassed a considerable fortune as naval storekeeper at Port Mahon, Menorca. In 1815/16, at the end of the Napoleonic Wars, he came to Lower Canada where he was granted large tracts of land in the Eastern Townships. He brought with him his extended family and settled on property in Ascot Township near Sherbrooke. Felton raised livestock and also leased some of his land. He served in the local militia, becoming lieutenant- colonel, and also served as justice of the peace. In 1822, he was named to the Legislative Council of Lower Canada. He attempted to establish a colonization company to encourage development of the region, without success. In 1827, he was named Commissioner of crown lands. He was suspended from this position in 1836, after having been accused of improperly selling crown property as if it were his own.

The church has also been known as Breedon Priory and as the Holy Hill Monastery. The church was founded as a monastery in the 7th century, and contains the largest collection, and some of the finest examples, of Anglo-Saxon sculptures. It also contains a notable family pew and Renaissance-era church monuments to the Shirley family, who bought the manor of Breedon after it was surrendered to the Crown in 1539 during the Dissolution of the Monasteries. The largest of these monuments is for Sir George Shirley. It was made over 20 years before his death and includes a life-sized skeleton carved in alabaster. The church stands on the top of Breedon Hill, within the remains of an Iron Age hill fort called The Bulwarks. The hill is flanked to the south by the 400 houses of Breedon on the Hill village, and encroached on the east by Breedon Quarry. Breedon church is a nationally important building, with a Grade I listing for its exceptional architectural interest. ==HistoryHoly Hill Monastery=== The church was founded as a monastery in about 676 on the site of the Bulwarks hill fort and a hermitage. The church was founded by Aethelred, third son of Penda (who ruled until 706) according to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. The land was given by Friduricus with the stipulation that Headda would be made the abbot. Friduricus is a candidate for the four saints who are interred here, possibly in a now-buried crypt. The hagiography of the Secgan Manuscript records the other three saints buried in Breedon-on-the-Hill are Anglo-Saxon saints Eardwulf of Northumbria, Beonna of Breedon and Cotta of Breedon.Stowe MS 944, British LibraryThe Oxford Dictionary of Saints, Oxford University Press. Headda was to become a Bishop of Lichfield and later, in 731, the monastery trained Tatwine to be its abbot, a position he held until 794. Tatwine was known for his rhyming riddles and for his later ascension to Archbishop of Canterbury.Lapidge \\"Tatwine (d. 734)\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography The lands that supported the monastery were added to by King Aethelred. In 1066, the manor of Breedon was given by William the Conqueror to the de Ferrers family, who later became the Earls of Derby. Domesday Book in 1086 records that Henry de Ferrers held Breedon.The Domesday Book, 1086 ===Breedon Priory=== Breedon priory was founded as an Augustinian monastery in around 1120, on the site of the earlier Saxon Benedictine abbey of Holy Hill Monastery. The priory was a cell of Nostell Priory in Yorkshire and there seems to have been between three and five canons in residence at any one time, usually from Nostell. Candidates for Prior were also usually selected by Nostell. Gervase, a prior of Breedon, attempted to gain independence for the priory from Nostell, but failed and subsequently resigned in 1244. In 1441 a visit from William Alnwick, Bishop of Lincoln (Leicestershire was historically within the Diocese of Lincoln), found the monastery to be dilapidated and in debt. By 1535 there was no resident community at the priory, which was now occupied only by the prior. The Valor Ecclesiasticus of 1535 recorded the priory had an annual income, after expenses, of £24. 10s. 4d. The priory was surrendered for dissolution in November 1539. It was later sold to Francis Shirley, head of the local manorial family, who were recusants. After the Dissolution, the eastern part of the priory with the formerly central tower was retained for parish use. The nave and other buildings were demolished.

Interior and exterior locations in and around the church as well as the neighbouring field were used in the 2016 'Step into the Light' music video by British rock band Chasing Deer. ==Inside the churchAnglo-Saxon carvings=== The church contains a series of important Saxon relief sculpture, some of which may be amongst the earliest to survive in England. These carvings came from the original Saxon abbey church. They are not the earliest finds as neolithic artefacts have also been found on the hill. Around the church are many early carvings which are frequently included as stones in the interior walls. However they are wrapped in lead sheet as though they are not intended to be structural. The carvings are dated to the 9th century and include Celtic patterns, lions, people, cocks and other birds that are pecking at vines. ===Shirley monuments=== Carving of George Shirley (died 1588) on the right-hand side of his monument Skeleton at the foot of George Shirley's monument The church contains many 16th and 17th century tombs of the Shirley family which bought the monastery site. There are two substantial tomb chests carved from Chellaston alabaster. The oldest chest tomb is for Francis Shirley and his wife. Around the chest are carved mourners arranged in pairs. This tomb is dated 1571. The other, similar tomb is for John Shirley and his wife, and is dated 1585. Both of these tombs were made by Richard and Gabriel Royley of Burton upon Trent. The tomb of Sir Francis Shirley was repaired after 60 years by his great-grandson, Thomas Shirley. The latter recorded that even after 60 years, Francis' body was well preserved, with only a black mark apparent on one of his toes but with no sign of rot. His body was re-wrapped in material and returned to his tomb. Three substantial tombs were constructed to memorialize Sir George Shirley, his father John, and his grandfather Thomas. By far the largest monument dominating the inside of the church is that dedicated to Sir George Shirley. It was made over 20 years before Shirley died in 1622. It is dated 1598 and consists of three storeys. On the bottom storey is a realistic skeleton carved from alabaster and showing the mortality of those portrayed above. The inclusion of this cadaver in the design was unusual for the time. The second storey is supported on six pillars and the space is divided into two arched spaces. To the right and facing right in prayer is Sir George Shirley with his two sons behind him. All three figures are dressed in brightly painted period dress and the clothes include details in gold. In the left arch is his wife (d. 1595), daughter, and two babies. According to the Latin inscription, Shirley's wife died aged 29 whilst giving birth. The third storey, again supported by six more pillars, is a canopy made in stone and incorporating a large, central, carved coat of arms. The monument was constructed from large blocks of alabaster. It was rebuilt in the 19th century by the stonemason Thomas Allt, who added his signature to the work. ===Pews=== The Shirley family pew was carved in 1627. The rest of the box pews date from the 18th century. The Shirley family pew now sits to the left of the main monument in the north aisle. In the past this wooden structure was said to be in the main body of the church. It is appropriate that it is now in the vaulted north aisle, as this entire aisle was in the separate ownership of the Shirley family until the 1950s. ==Churchyard== View from the air, showing quarry The churchyard contains one war grave, of a soldier of the Machine Gun Corps of World War I. ==St Hardulf== St Hardulf is thought to be Eardwulf of Northumbria. The connection has been made by several historians and is uncontroversial, but not certain. Supporting evidence comes from a 12th- century list of the burial places of saints compiled at Peterborough. This calls the Saint Hardulph to whom Breedon was dedicated \\"Hardulfus rex\\"--King Eardwulf--and states that he was buried at Breedon.The identity of Eardwulf and Saint Hardulph, and the link to Breedon, is accepted by Rollason (\\"Eardwulf\\", in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography) and Williams et al (\\"Eardwulf\\" in the Biographical Dictionary)See also ==Church organisation== Breedon parish is in the Deanery of North West Leicestershire, the Diocese of Leicester and the Province of Canterbury.

The monthly 24-hour average temperatures range from in January to in July, and the annual mean is . Precipitation is light in the winter, and more than 2/3 of the year's precipitation occurs from June to September. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 44% in July to 64% in January and February, the city receives 2,413 hours of bright sunshine annually, with the latter half of winter being especially sunny. ==Administrative divisions== Suifenhe administers two towns: *Suifenhe Town () *Funing () ==TransportRoad=== Suifenhe is also a terminus of both G10 Suifenhe–Manzhouli Expressway and China National Highway 301, which run northwest to Manzhouli (Inner Mongolia), which is another China–Russia port- of-entry. ===Road and rail border crossing=== Suifenhe is one of the points where China's and Russia's railway systems connect through a rail border crossing on the Sino-Russian border. The rail line was originally constructed as the Chinese Eastern Railway in the early 20th century, but now serves as the terminus of the Harbin-Suifenhe Railway. The train station on the opposite side of the border is Grodekovo, in the town of Pogranichny, Primorsky Krai. As of December 2009, Russian train schedule sites show the existence of the passenger train no. 401, making the 26-km trip between Suifenhe and Grodekovo twice a week; however, the twice-a-week trains no. 006, Khabarovsk–Harbin, and no. 967, Vladivostok–Harbin only have a scheduled stop in Grodekovo and not in Suifenhe.Russian train schedules site.

The cross-border rail line is important for freight transportation. As of 2015, the main cargo entering China from Russia over this railway crossing is iron ore; at 1.3 million tons over the first 5 months of the year, it constitutes about 1/3 of the total import cargo volume. The G10 Suifenhe–Manzhouli Expressway and China National Highway 301, which terminates at Suifenhe is connected via a road border crossing to Russia's A184 Highway. The nearest city to the crossing on the Russian side is Pogranichny. ==Environmental issues== The Environmental Investigation Agency conducted an investigation in February 2008, in the illegal logging of Russian wood, which was taking place in Suifenhe.

The area was settled by the 1900s (decade), and in 1911 the town of Wongan Hills was established and named after the range. ==Etymology== \\"Wongan\\" is derived from the Indigenous Australian name \\"wangan-katta\\", \\"wankan\\" and \\"woongan\\". \\"Katta\\" is known to mean \\"hill\\", but the meaning of \\"wongan\\" is uncertain.

War crimes have been broadly defined as violations of the laws or customs of war, which include crimes against either enemy combatants or enemy non-combatants. War crimes also included deliberate attacks on citizens and property of neutral states as they fall under the category of non-combatants, as at the attack on Pearl Harbor. Military personnel from the Empire of Japan have been accused and/or convicted of committing many such acts during the period of Japanese imperialism from the late 19th to mid-20th centuries. They have been accused of conducting a series of human rights abuses against civilians and prisoners of war (POWs) throughout east Asia and the western Pacific region. These events reached their height during the Second Sino-Japanese War of 1937–45 and the Asian and Pacific campaigns of World War II (1941–45). In Japan itself, the description of particular events as war crimes — and specific details of these events — are often disputed by Japanese nationalists, such as Tsukurukai (Society for History Textbook Reform). Such organisations and their activities are a subject of controversy and are alleged to be examples of historical revisionism. ==International law== Although the 1929 Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War provided the regulations how prisoners of war should be treated, the Empire of Japan never signed the agreement (except the 1929 Geneva Convention on the Sick and Wounded). However, many of the alleged crimes committed by imperial personnel were also violations of the Japanese code of military law, which Japanese authorities either ignored or failed to enforce. The empire also violated provisions of the Treaty of Versailles, such as article 171, which outlawed the use of poison gas (chemical weapons), and other international agreements signed by Japan, such as the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907, which protect prisoners of war (POWs). According to historian Akira Fujiwara, Hirohito personally ratified on 5 August 1937 a proposition by his Army chief of staff, Prince Kan'in , to remove the constraint of those conventions on the treatment of Chinese prisoners.Fujiwara, Nitchû Sensô ni Okeru Horyo Gyakusatsu, Kikan Sensô Sekinin Kenkyû 9, 1995, p.22 ===Japan and international treaties=== In Japan, the term \\"Japanese war crimes\\" generally refers to cases tried by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, also known as the Tokyo Trials, following the end of the Pacific War. The tribunal did not prosecute war crimes allegations involving mid-ranking officers or more junior personnel. Those were dealt with separately in other cities throughout the Asia-Pacific region. The Japanese government said that Japan was not a signatory to the 1929 Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War, although it was the signatory of the 1907 Hague Convention, which provided humane treatment of prisoners of war (POWs), and the 1929 Geneva Convention on the Sick and Wounded Armed Forces in the Field, which provided humane treatment for enemy combatants who were injured, sick, or any other causes in the battlefield. It also signed the Kellogg-Briand Pact in 1929, thereby rendering its actions in 1937–45 liable to charges of crimes against peace, a charge which was introduced at the Tokyo Trials to prosecute Class-A War Criminals. (Class-B War Criminals are those found guilty of war crimes per se, and Class-C War Criminals are those guilty of crimes against humanity.) However, any convictions for such crimes are not required to be recognized by the Japanese government, as the Kellogg-Briand Pact did not have an enforcement clause stipulating penalties in the event of violation. The Japanese government accepted the terms set by the Potsdam Declaration (1945) after the end of the war. The declaration alluded, in Article 10, to two kinds of war crime: one was the violation of international laws, such as the abuse of prisoners of war (POWs); the other was obstructing \\"democratic tendencies among the Japanese people\\" and civil liberties within Japan. ===Japanese law=== Japanese law does not recognize those convicted in the Tokyo Trials and other trials as criminals, despite the fact that Japan's governments have accepted the judgments made in the trials and in the Treaty of San Francisco (1952). This is because the treaty does not mention the legal validity of the tribunal. In the Japanese text, the word used for \\"accept\\" is judaku, as opposed to the stronger shounin (\\"to approve\\"). Those convicted have had no ability, under Japanese law, to appeal, as the Tokyo Tribunal and other war crimes courts have no standing in Japanese law. Under normal circumstances, it violates a number of fundamental principles of modern legal procedure to punish someone whose crime and penalty were defined only after the fact. Had Japan certified the legal validity of the war crimes tribunals in the San Francisco Treaty, this might have resulted in Japanese courts reversing such verdicts. Any such outcomes would have created domestic political crises and would have been unacceptable in international diplomatic circles. The current Japanese jurists' consensus regarding the legal standing of the Tokyo tribunal is that, as a condition of ending the war, the Allies demanded a number of conditions including the execution and/or incarceration of those whom they deemed to be responsible for the war. These people were defined as guilty by a tribunal organized by the Allies. The Japanese government accepted these demands in the Potsdam Declaration and then accepted the actual sentencing in the San Francisco Treaty, which officially ended the state of war between Japan and the Allies. Although the penalties for the convicted, including execution, can be regarded as a violation of their technical legal rights, the constitution allowed such violations if proper legal procedure was followed, in the general public interest. Therefore, any such execution and/or incarceration is constitutionally valid, but has no relationship to Japanese criminal law. Hence those convicted as war criminals are not defined as criminals in Japan, although their execution and incarceration is regarded as legally valid. == International definitions == Outside Japan, different societies use widely different timeframes in defining Japanese war crimes. For example, the annexation of Korea by Japan in 1910 was followed by the abolition of the traditional class system by Joseon and modernization against the Korean people. Thus, some Koreans refer to \\"Japanese war crimes\\" as events occurring during the period shortly prior to 1910 to 1945. Events such as the March 1st movement where 7,000 people were killedEncyclopædia Britannica, \\"March First Movement\\" and the murder of Empress Myeongseong are considered war crimes in Korea. By comparison, the United States did not come into military conflict with Japan until 1941, and thus Americans may consider \\"Japanese war crimes\\" as encompassing only those events that occurred from 1941 to 1945. A complicating factor is that a minority of people in every Asian and Pacific country invaded by Japan collaborated with the Japanese military, or even served in it, for a wide variety of reasons, such as economic hardship, coercion, or antipathy to other imperialist powers. Many Koreans served in the Imperial armed forces. The Formosan Army, which was part of the Imperial Japanese Army, was recruited from ethnic Chinese men on Formosa. The Indian National Army, under Subhas Chandra Bose, is perhaps the best-known example of a movement opposed to European imperialism, which was formed during World War II to assist the Japanese military. Prominent individual nationalists in other countries, such as the later Indonesian president, Suharto, also served with Japanese imperial forces. The Burmese nationalist leader Aung San initially sided with the Japanese, forming the Burma National Army, but turned against them in early 1945. In some cases such non-Japanese personnel were also responsible for war crimes committed by the Empire of Japan. B. V. A. Roling, the Dutch justice at the Tokyo trials, noted how \\"many of the commanders and guards in POW camps were Koreans [as] the Japanese apparently did not trust them as soldiers.\\" Korean guards, he added, were often said to be \\"far more cruel than the Japanese.\\"Roling, B.V.A and Antonio Cassese (1993). The Tokyo Trial and Beyond, pp. 76–77. One Korean described abject Allied POWs: \\"now I have seen how depraved and worthless the white man is.\\" For political reasons, many non-Japanese personnel in the Imperial armed forces were never investigated or tried after 1945. In South Korea especially, it is alleged that such people were often able to acquire wealth by participating in exploitative activities with the Japanese military. It is further alleged in South Korea that some former collaborators have covered up \\"Japanese\\" war crimes in order to avoid their own prosecution and/or exposure. It has been argued that acts committed against people subject to Japanese sovereignty cannot be considered \\"war crimes\\". The issue of Japan's de facto or de jure sovereignty over places such as Ryukyu (1879–1945), Taiwan (1895–1945), and Korea (1910–1945) prior to 1945, is a matter of controversy. Japanese control was accepted and recognized internationally and was justified by instruments such as the Treaty of Shimonoseki (1895, which included China's cession of Taiwan) and the Japan–Korea Annexation Treaty (1910). The legality of the Japan–Korea Annexation Treaty, in particular, is in question because it was not signed by the Korean head of state; it was signed by government ministers. The native populations were not consulted on the changes in sovereignty, nor was there universal acceptance of such annexations. There was ongoing resistance to Japanese invasions and — in any case — war crimes may also be committed during civil wars. (See Korea under Japanese rule and Taiwan under Japanese rule for further details.) There are also allegations that war crimes were committed even after the Empire of Japan officially surrendered on August 14, 1945. For instance, it is believed that Allied prisoners of war who survived the Sandakan Death Marches, in North Borneo, were killed up to two weeks after the Emperor signed the surrender document. == Notes == == References == Japanese war crimes Defin Category:Historiography of Japan Category:Military historiography Category:Historical negationism Category:Military history of Japan Category:Imperial Japanese Army ","title":"Definitions of Japanese war crimes"},{"id":"9070401","text":"Fjord1 Fylkesbaatane (formerly known as Fylkesbaatane i Sogn og Fjordane and Nordre Bergenhus Amts Dampskibe) is a Norwegian transport company. It is a subsidiary of the Fjord1 Nordvestlandske conglomerate and primarily runs ferry, passenger and freight traffic in Vestland county. The company was founded in 1858 under the name Nordre Bergenhus Amts Dampskibe and the first two ships SS Framnæs and SS Fjalir were purchased that year. The company was publicly owned as it has remained since. From 1896 to 1903 later Norwegian Prime minister Christian Michelsen was director. In 1919 the company changed its name to Fylkesbaatane i Sogn og Fjordane. In 1914 the two first motor ships were purchased. In 1937 the company built their last steam powered ship SS Fanaraaken. In 1939 the first car ferry, Lærdal, was added to the fleet. During the 1950s, '60s and '70s, the company grew along with the general post- WWII expansion and improvement in Norwegian infrastructure. The company developed into its present form from the late 1960s when the first fast passenger boats were built. From the same period car ferries became a top priority. The bulk of the Fylkesbaatane fleet still consists of ferries from the period 1960–1980. In 1971 the company opened a fast passenger route from Sogn og Fjordane to Bergen. One of the ships used was the world's first commercial passenger catamaran M/S Fjordglytt. Today there is one route from Bergen to Sogn and one to Nordfjord. The Sogn route is at its end stop in Øvre Årdal 6 hours and 15 minutes after leaving Bergen. The Nordfjord route is at its end stop in Selje 4 hours and 55 minutes after leaving Bergen. There are also several local fast passenger boat routes. In 2001 Fylkesbaatane i Sogn og Fjordane and Møre og Romsdal Fylkesbåtar created the company Nordvestlandske. The cooperation culminated in 2002, by the formation of the Fjord1 Nordvestlandske group. This merger did not go down undisputed, as some of the decisions were seen as unfavourable to Møre og Romsdal. It was decided that the conglomerate headquarters should be located in Florø. It was also unpopular in Møre og Romsdal that Sogn og Fjordane county received a 59% majority share in Fjord1, thereby effectively seizing control of the company. The ships of Fylkesbaatane have been a vital and major part of the lives of people living in the steep fjords and along the rugged coastline of Sogn og Fjordane. Before the transportation network was developed significantly from the 1950s they were the only means of transportation in the region. This has among other things been reflected by the Norwegian Postal Service issuing three stamps featuring the Fylkesbaatane ships Framnæs, Kommandøren and Hornelen. A few of the old legendary fjord ships are preserved by enthusiasts. Among them are Atløy , delivered in 1931, and Stavenes. Several books have also been written on the history of the company and its ships. Fjord1 Fylkesbaatane has around 700 employees and its main office in Florø. The company is currently involved in a project to introduce Liquefied natural gas (LNG) powered car ferries. Two such ferries are already in operation and more are under construction at Aker Yards and BLRT Fiskerstrand. ==Fleet== {  valign=\\"top\\" style=\\"width:50%;\\"  ;Car ferries *MF Aurland *MF Bergensfjord *MF Dalsfjord *MF Eid *MF Etne *MF Fanafjord *MF Fanaraaken *MF Fjærlandsfjord *MF Florøy *MF Førdefjord *MF Gloppen *MF Gulen *MF Lote *MF Lærdal *MF Mastrafjord *MF Nordfjord *MF Nårasund *MF Raunefjord *MF Selje *MF Sogn *MF Sognefjord *MF Stavangerfjord  valign=\\"top\\"  *MF Stryn *MF Sunnfjord *MF Svanøy *MF Værøy ;Combination ships *MS Fjordglytt *MS Sylvarnes ;Passenger ferries *MS Gudvangen *MS Skagastøl (otherwise known as the Nice Boat) ;Fast passenger boats *MS Delfin jr. *MS Fjordprins *MS Fjordtroll *MS Kommandøren *MS Solundir } ==Sources== *Fjord1 official site == References == Category:Ferry companies of Vestland Category:Shipping companies of Norway Category:Companies based in Vestland Category:Companies established in 1858 Category:1858 establishments in Norway Category:Fjord1 Category:Kinn Category:Sogn og Fjordane County Municipality ","title":"Fjord1 Fylkesbaatane"},{"id":"9070417","text":"Neftekumsk () is a town and the administrative center of Neftekumsky District in Stavropol Krai, Russia, located on the right bank of the Kuma River, east of Stavropol, the administrative center of the krai.

He was involved, as were all his siblings, in studies directed by his father in Degel until the family and some followers were exiled in 1804. Like his brother Muhammed Bello and his sister Nana Asma’u, he dedicated significant part of his early years to study and wrote poetry, history, and on Islamic studies. Many of his works of history and poetry survive and are considered key texts of the era. In 1815, when Usman dan Fodio died, he briefly contested his brother Muhammed Bello for control of the Sokoto Caliphate. The bloodless succession struggle ended with Bello the Sultan of the Caliphate and Atiku imprisoned for one year. When he was released, he became and adviser to Mohammed Bello for the remainder of Bello's life. ==Sultan== Atiku became the Sultan in 1837 when his brother Muhammed Bello died. Atiku was disliked by some of the Emirs of the Caliphate who tried to organize for other candidates, but Atiku was quickly named the successor to his brother. Atiku attempted to reverse some of the policies of Bello that he considered extravagant. He banned dancing and music and made instruction in the Caliphate much more rigid. In addition, although Bello had operated his administration out of Wurno for the final years of his life, Atiku moved the capital back to Sokoto. However, his reign was highly unpopular to both the population and the Emirs of the Caliphate. At the end of his reign, the tension came to a fore when he recognized an autonomous leader carving out the Adamawa Emirate. Modibo Adama has fought in the Fulani war with Atiku's father Usman dan Fodio. Atiku saw an opportunity to support a ruler more loyal to him in Hamman Sambo and so recognized an independent Emirate under Hamman Sambo that took a significant part of the Adamawa territory. Adama threatened to leave the Sokoto Caliphate and instead join the Ottoman Caliphate as a result of the situation. The Adamawa Emirate was close to civil war until emissaries arrived revealing that Atiku had died and his successor had quickly reversed the decision to recognize Sambo. Atiku was wounded during a campaign he led against the die- hards of \\"Tsibiri\\" in the autumn of 1842. He would succumb from his wounds on November 23, 1842, and was succeeded by his nephew Ali Babba bin Bello, one week after his death. ==Lineage== One of his sons was Ahmadu Atiku, the fifth Sultan, and another son was \`Abd ar-Rahman dan Abi Bakar, the eleventh Sultan of the Sokoto Caliphate. His grandson was Muhammadu Attahiru I, final sultan of the independent Sokoto Caliphate. ==References== Category:1782 births Category:1842 deaths Category:Sultans of Sokoto Category:19th-century rulers in Africa Category:19th-century Nigerian people Category:Dan Fodio family Category:18th-century Nigerian people ","title":"Abu Bakr Atiku"},{"id":"9070449","text":"Requiem – Mezzo Forte is the centerpiece of Virgin Black's Requiem trilogy.

Co-op Funds is a synonym for Market Development Funds. There are approximately 4,500 Co-op programs in the US made up of 50 product classifications on which some 50 billion dollars is spent each year. Slightly over half of that 50 billion dollars offered to partners each year by Brands goes unused because of uninformed partners implementation issues. == Developing an MDF Strategy == While developing the MDF strategy, clarity of objective is critical for the MDF program designer. Generally, as a best practice, program designers should ask the following questions while defining the program: * Why - Why are we deploying these MDF funds? * Who - Who will these MDF funded promotions target? * When - What should be the timing for this targeting? * Where - What is the geographic location or category of prospect targeting? * How - How can the MDF funds be used for maximum impact? * What - What will you exactly do with the funds? * Result - What specific result are you expecting from the program? ==Funding Structures== Market Development Funds are structured in different ways depending on the brands relationship with its affiliates (Open vs. Closed networks), the destination of Co-op Funds (for direct mail, email marketing, local PPC, etc.), and segment of affiliates the brand is trying to motivate or reward (top-performers, average-performers, low-performers). The way Co-op money is structured is important as it affects affiliates' willingness to participate in the brand's proposed marketing programs. Below are four common funding structures. Stipend - This structure gives affiliates the freedom to use a fixed quantity of money ($300 per month for example) to opt into marketing programs that the brand makes available. Although affiliates have the option to choose among a range of programs, brands tend to highlight the programs in which they want affiliates to participate giving them prominence on the main interface of the Marketing Automation Platform brands and affiliates use to collaborate. Fixed Quantity - Sometimes brands, instead of giving a dollar amount, provide access to a fixed number of items (ex. direct mail pieces) or resources of a program (ex. local PPC) at no cost. The zero cost is aimed at motivating local affiliates with strong brand support. Discount - Brands partially subsidize the local marketing spend of their affiliates with discounted, but not free, marketing programs. Brands try to convince affiliates that will subsidized marketing ROI on their marketing spend will be positive. Rebate - Some Brands reimburse their local partners for money spent on approved advertising. This approach is often not recommended because Brands have a hard time motivating affiliates to spend their money first and try to recoup it later through cumbersome reimbursement logistics. == References == Category:Distribution (marketing) ","title":"Market development funds"},{"id":"9070590","text":"Kelso is a suburb in the City of Townsville, Queensland, Australia.

The oldest preserved document that mentions Bosjö Abbey was written by Pope Lucius III in 1181, when he confirmed its privileges. The abbey was transformed into a castle in the 16th century, and only parts of the original building remains. During the Danish Reformation in the 16th century, the nunnery was closed down and the estate became Danish crown property. It was subsequently donated to Torbern Bille, the former archbishop of the Diocese of Lund under the condition that he took care of the remaining nuns. In 1560 King Frederick II of Denmark gave the estate as a barter to the widowed Scanian noble woman Thale Ulfstand. Her initials and the year 1569 are carved into the large oak doors of the entrance and are still visible. The castle passed to the Beck family through marriage in 1629, but when Jochum Beck (1602-1682) lost the family fortune, it was sold to Corfitz Ulfeldt (1606–1664) to repay his debts. Ulfeldt was a Danish aristocrat famous for having switched sides. When he showed up at the peace negotiations at the Treaty of Roskilde proceedings to negotiate on behalf of Sweden, he was convicted of treason by a Danish court. Soon thereafter, he was also convicted of treason by a Swedish court, and was forced into exile. His wife Leonora Christina (1621-1698), daughter of King Christian IV, was captured in his place by the Danish authorities and was imprisoned in the Blue Tower in Copenhagen for 22 years. Bosjökloster Castle was sequestered by the Swedish state and fell into disrepair. After a lawsuit in 1735, Bosjökloster was returned to the Beck family, who renovated the castle. They sold it in 1908 to Count Philip Bonde, whose family still owns Bosjökloster. The composer Hilding Rosenberg (1892–1985) was born in the gardener's residence just south of the church tower. ==Gallery== File:Bosjo monastery in Skane Sweden1.jpgSt Appolonia in the Bosjö Monastery File:Bosjo monastery in Skane Sweden8.jpgVotive portrait of several generations of the Laxmand family File:Bosjo monastery in Skane Sweden9.jpgThe retable in the monastery church of Bosjö #1, featuring votive portraits of the couple who donated it, Peter Bille and Birgitte Laxmand File:Bosjo monastery in Skane Sweden10.jpgThe retable in the monastery church of Bosjö #2; the initials and coats of arms of the couple who donated it are visible—P B for Peter Bille and B L for Birgitte Laxmand File:Bosjo monastery in Skane Sweden12.jpgThe gravestone of Thale Ulfstand from late 1500s File:Bosjö 1852 till 1863.jpgBosjö Monastery about 1850 File:Bosjökloster, Skåne, Sweden.jpgBosjö Monastery in 2005 File:Bosjo monastery in Skane Sweden3.jpg File:Bosjo monastery in Skane Sweden4.jpg File:Bosjo monastery in Skane Sweden5.jpg File:Bosjo monastery in Skane Sweden6.jpg File:Bosjo monastery in Skane Sweden11.jpgThe interior of the monastery church of Bosjö File:Bosjökloster.jpgBosjö Monastery in 2012 ==See also== List of castles in Skåne ==References== ==External links== *Bosjökloster Slott Official site Category:Castles in Skåne County Category:Tourist attractions in Skåne County Category:Buildings and structures in Skåne County ","title":"Bosjökloster"},{"id":"9070709","text":"Spanțov is a commune in Călărași County, Muntenia, Romania.

Lokomotiv first came together in January 2003 in Orange County, California, with Gemora, California native Danny Gonzales and guitarist James MacDonnell forming the initial line-up. A year later, David Aguirre of Razorback was recruited into the band. A few months later Artadi, who was then living in San Francisco, was offered the job of fronting the band; he accepted. At this point, MacDonnell opted to leave the band. ==Debut album, new vocalist and break-up== In October 2005, the band recorded their debut album, entitled Rock N' Roll Death Toll. A music video was filmed for one of the album's tracks -- Five Alive. This music video saw heavy rotation in the Philippines through MYX Music Channel and MTV Asia. The debut album was released in the Philippines in September 2006. Basti Artadi left the band on June 24, 2006, due to \\"musical and creative differences\\". In late August 2006 singer/songwriter Ryan Hudson, hailing from Norman, Oklahoma was recruited to front the band.

W. Bond, fl. 1827–1849. (New) Hawarden Castle () is a house in Hawarden, Flintshire, Wales. It was the estate of the former British prime minister William Ewart Gladstone, having previously belonged to the family of his wife, Catherine Glynne. Built in the mid-18th century, it was later enlarged and externally remodelled in the Gothic taste. ==History== Hawarden Castle and New Hawarden Castle, 1740 Gladstone's Hawarden Castle circa 1880. New Hawarden Castle 2006 The core of the present house is formed by a mansion built in 1752–57 for Sir John Glynne, 6th baronet, to the designs of Samuel Turner the elder of Whitchurch. It replaced the 16th century Broadlane Hall, the seat of the Ravenscroft family, which stood some way to the south. Glynne had acquired the estate through marriage. The new house was of brick with stone dressings. The main block was three storeys high, and seven bays wide, with a projecting three-bay central pediment. Two flanking side pavilions were planned but may not have been completed. In the early 19th century, Sir Stephen Richard Glynne, 8th Baronet inherited the estate. In 1809 to 1810, he had the house enlarged, and the exterior completely remodelled in a crenellated Gothic Revival style, by the London architect Thomas Cundy the elder, although the Georgian interiors were preserved. He died prematurely and Sir Stephen Glynne, the 9th Baronet was left to make further improvements. He was the Lord Lieutenant of Flintshire, Member of Parliament for the Borough of Flint from 1832 to 1837, and for the County of Flint from 1837 to 1847. In around 1830, he had the main entrance moved from the south side of the house to the north, and had a vaulted porch added. On the death of the 9th Baronet, the estate passed to his brother-in-law, the liberal politician William Ewart Gladstone. There were further alterations to the house during Gladstone's occupancy, including a wing housing a library, designed by George Shaw of Saddleworth, built in the mid-1860s, a muniment room for the storage of his papers (1887–88), and an enlarged porch (1889), these last two both by Douglas and Fordham. In 1896 the Archbishop of Canterbury, Edward White Benson, died at the castle and his body was put on the train at nearby Sandycroft station to be returned to London.An article about the Archbishop's death on the Flintshire website Gladstone occupied the house until his death there in 1898, when it passed to his grandson William Glynne Charles Gladstone (son of W. E. Gladstone's eldest son, William Henry Gladstone, who had been High Sheriff of Flintshire for 1888 but had died in 1891). W. G. C. Gladstone was killed in the First World War. The estate was subsequently purchased by his uncle Henry Gladstone, 1st Baron Gladstone of Hawarden. The house and estate are still a private residence (although some of the grounds are open to the public) and are still owned by the Gladstone family. In the grounds of the building lie the ruins of a medieval castle, Hawarden Castle. This was built on the site of an Iron Age fort by the Normans and had a round keep built on a motte. Llywelyn ap Gruffudd captured the stronghold in 1265, defeating Robert de Montalt and destroying the castle. De Montalt later reneged on a promise not to rebuild his stronghold and the present massive keep was built. This was besieged in 1281 by Llywelyn's brother, Dafydd. The fatal war of 1282 to 1283 followed, with the Welsh being defeated and Hawarden Castle was occupied by the English after that. During the English Civil War it changed hands several times and ended up in a ruinous state in Parliamentary hands. The house is designated as a Grade I listed building by Cadw because of its architecture, especially the 18th-century interiors, and for its exceptional importance as the home of W. E. Gladstone. ==See also== *List of houses and associated buildings by John Douglas *Fasque House – William Gladstone's father's country house ==References== ==External links== * Hawarden Castle on Gathering the Jewels * Article on Hawarden Castle in House and Heritage, 22 January 2018 Category:Castles in Flintshire Category:Mock castles in Wales Category:Houses completed in 1752 Category:Country houses in Wales Category:Grade I listed buildings in Flintshire Category:Grade I listed houses Category:Prime Ministerial homes in the United Kingdom Category:Grade I listed castles in Wales ","title":"Hawarden Castle (18th century)"},{"id":"9070790","text":"Ole Bjur (born 13 September 1968) is a Danish former professional footballer who played 384 matches for Brøndby IF, with whom he won three Danish Superliga championships.

However, after his slump in form for Brøndby in fall 1993, he was not chosen for the Danish national team by national manager Richard Møller Nielsen.Søren Olsen, \\"Genvalg til alle\\", Politiken, 27 August 1993 He was eventually included in the national team squad of newly appointed national manager Bo Johansson in the summer 1996. Bjur was called up for Johansson's first game in August 1996. He scored the winning goal in their debut match, as Denmark beat Sweden 1–0 in a friendly match. Bjur started the next national team match, but after 22 minutes, he suffered a minor concussion from a swung elbow, and had to be substituted off. Bjur was then displaced by midfielder Peter Nielsen for the next national team games, before playing his last international game in August 1997. ==Honours== Brøndby IF * Danish Superliga: 1995–96, 1996–97, 1997–98 * Danish Cup: 1993–94, 1997–98 Individual *1991 Danish 1st Division Player of the Year *1994 Brøndby IF Player of the Year ==References== ==External links== *Danish national team profile * Brøndby IF partial statistics *Danish Superliga statistics Category:1968 births Category:Living people Category:Danish footballers Category:Brøndby IF players Category:Danish Superliga players Category:Denmark international footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:People from Rødovre ","title":"Ole Bjur"},{"id":"9070810","text":"\\"The longest suicide note in history\\" is an epithet originally used by United Kingdom Labour MP Gerald Kaufman to describe his party's 1983 general election manifesto, which emphasised socialist policies in a more profound manner than previous such documents—and which Kaufman felt would ensure that the Labour Party (then in opposition) would fail to win the election. ==Document== The New Hope for Britain was a 39-page bookletNew Hope for Britain: Labour's Manifesto 1983, which called for unilateral nuclear disarmament; higher personal taxation for the rich; withdrawal from the European Economic Community; abolition of the House of Lords; and the re-nationalisation of recently privatised industries such as British Aerospace and the British Shipbuilders Corporation. The manifesto was based on an earlier and much longer policy paper with a similar title, Labour's Plan: the New Hope for Britain.Britain in Transition: The Twentieth Century, Alfred F. Havighurst, , p.613 The epithet referred not only to the orientation of the policies, but also to their marketing. Labour leader Michael Foot decided as a statement on internal democracy that the manifesto would consist of all resolutions arrived at in its party conference. The document's more left-wing policy proposals, along with the popularity gained by Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher over the successful outcome of the Falklands War and the division of the opposition vote between the left-wing Labour Party and the centrist Social Democratic Party – Liberal Alliance, composed of breakaway Labour MPs on the right wing of the party, contributed to a victory with a substantial majority in Parliament for the right-wing Conservative Party Government. The defeat, Labour's worst result since the 1918 general election, led to a turning point in the history of the party, which thereafter gradually moved to the right under the leadership of Neil Kinnock and then under the leadership of Tony Blair in the 1990s rebranded itself as \\"New Labour\\" and Third Way. Blair led Labour back to government in a landslide victory at the 1997 general election, fourteen years and two general election defeats later. ==Other uses of the phrase== It has subsequently been used by Peter Gutmann in his paper \\"A Cost Analysis of Windows Vista Content Protection\\" to describe the digital rights management schemes in the Windows Vista operating system. Dutch VVD politician Mark Rutte used the phrase in reference to the election programme of the Dutch Labour Party, during the May 2010 parliamentary election campaign, deliberately echoing Kaufman. In the United States, The Washington Post columnist Charles Krauthammer compared the 2012 Republican House Budget to the manifesto (in terms of comparable unpopularity) and then remarked of the American House Budget, \\"At 37 footnotes, it might be the most annotated suicide note in history.\\" Neoconservative writer David Frum compared The Path to Prosperity, proposed by congressman Paul Ryan, in a similar light, saying \\"This is how a great political party was impelled to base a presidential campaign on the Ryan plan—a plan that has now replaced the 1983 manifesto of the British Labour Party as 'the longest suicide note in history'.\\" Labour's decision in 2015 to engrave promises for the upcoming election on a large stone monument nicknamed the \\"EdStone\\" (after leader Ed Miliband) was within hours dubbed the \\"heaviest suicide note in history\\". George Eaton predicted that immediately after the snap 2017 election, politicians and political writers would dismiss For the Many, Not the Few, Labour's left-wing manifesto in that campaign, as \\"the new 'longest suicide note in history'\\" (it was 128 pages long) but its policy proposals would remain popular with Labour members for some time afterwards. ==See also== * List of Labour Party (UK) general election manifestos ==References== ==External links== * Labour Party Manifesto 1983 (Archived) Category:English phrases Category:History of the Labour Party (UK) Category:Party programs Category:British political phrases Category:1983 United Kingdom general election Category:Michael Foot Category:1983 in British politics Category:1983 documents ","title":"The longest suicide note in history"},{"id":"9070821","text":"Carroll Township is a township in Vermilion County, Illinois, USA.

He was one of the student leaders and organizers of the movement. His contribution to the movement has been hailed by the other activists and students as he was popularly known as Bhasha Matin. ==Early life== Matin was admitted to Darjeeling School in 1932. After passing the matriculation in 1943 he came back to East Bengal. Later that year he was admitted to Rajshahi College. According to him he had no political consensus before getting into the college. He was graduated in 1947. ==Involvement in Language Movement== Matin was active during the language movement. When the government decided not to include Bengali as one of the official languages, students protested on March 11, 1948, where Matin joined for picketing. On 24 March 1948, after Mohammad Ali Jinnah made his speech at Race Course Maidan (currently Suhrawardy Udyan), he came to the University of Dhaka for convocation. Matin was also present at the ceremony to receive his degree. When Jinnah repeated his position about language policy, however, Matin stood up at the chair and shouted, No. It can not be. Other students also supported him during that time.Banglabazar Patrika, Magh 30, 1399 In mid-September 1951, in a meeting at the central building of Dhaka University, Matin said that they have no complaints about Urdu, but he wanted Bangla's status with Urdu. Matin was present at the meeting on 30 January 1952, and became a member of the Shorbodolio Rashtrabhasha Kormoporishod. Earlier, on 11 March 1951, a rally was held at Dhaka University, organised by the then East Pakistan Chatra (Student League). Khaleque Nawaz Khan, veteran student leader and the president of the then Chatra League, presided over that meeting. In that meeting, Matin was selected as convener of the Dhaka University Language Action Committee. ==Other political involvements== Matin joined with the 4th class clerks at one of their procession. There he was arrested and spend two months in prison. Coming back from jail, the Vice Chancellor of the university asked him for a bond. After his refusal, however, he was sacked for three years, which, according to him, was the turning point of his political career. He played an active role to form Chhatra Union in April 1952 and became the second president of its East Pakistan unit. Matin was appointed secretary of Communist Party's Pabna district unit in 1954. Three years later, he joined Maulana Bhasani's NAP. He formed East Pakistan Communist Party (ML) in 1958 and followed the ideology of Charu Majumdar, a communist revolutionary of India. After liberation, he fought against Jatiya Rakkhi Bahini and was arrested in 1972. ==Death== Matin died on 8 October 2014, at Dhaka's Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU). He was undergoing treatment at the ICU after a stroke on 18 August and was on life support after his condition deteriorated on 3 October. ==Awards== Matin was awarded Ekushey Padak in 2001.

Though she never left her homeland, she felt called to serve the needy of the world, for which purpose she founded the Missionary Sisters of the Immaculate Conception in 1902, the first missionary congregation of Canadian origin. The cause for her beatification is under study by the Holy See. ==Early life== She was born in Marieville, Quebec, on 4 February 1865. She and her twin brother Roch were among the nine children of Alexis Tétreault, a farmer, and his wife, Céline Ponton. She had a weak constitution and was usually sick but it was Roch who died seven months later. Two years after that loss, her mother died. Her father then decided to emigrate to the United States to find a living and she was taken in by her aunt, Julie Ponton, and her husband, Jean Alix. Tétreault was raised in a very religious household. When she was a child, she would hide in the attic where she would read through the stacks of copies of the periodicals published by the Propagation of the Faith and the Holy Childhood Association, both founded to promote the support of the missionary activity of the Catholic Church in Asia and Africa. For her education, her aunt enrolled her in a school in the village run by the Sisters of the Presentation of Mary. One night the young Tétreault had a very significant dream. She was kneeling by her bed when all at once, she saw a wheat field. The heads of the wheat each changed to heads of children from different parts of the world. At the age of 13, she begin to feel a calling to the religious life as part of this call to serve the needy of the earth. At the age of 15, she made the vow of perpetual chastity. ==Religious life== Deciding to act upon her sense of calling, at the age of 18, Tétreault asked to join the Carmelite monastery of Montreal but they refused her. She then applied to the Sisters of Charity of Saint-Hyacinthe, who accepted her as a postulant. However her poor health soon brought her back to her uncle's home. During that time, she felt confirmed in her call to establish some form of missionary service for Canadian women as the Paris Foreign Missions Society had provided to Canada in the early centuries of its development. ==Foundress== In 1891, Tétreault joined the Sisters of Bethany and stayed there for 10 years. It was during her time serving in a poor neighborhood of Montreal that she realized her dream of an apostolic school for women and a seminary for the foreign missions. Around this time, she met Father Gustave Bourassa who was her guide and led her to all the important persons she needed to fulfill her dreams. In 1902, Paul Bruchési, the Archbishop of Montreal gave permission for the founding of the congregation. Two years later, he went to Rome and spoke to Pope Pius X about this new foundation. The pope immediately answered, \\"Found, found, and all the blessings of Heaven will fall upon this new Institute and you will call them the Missionary Sisters of the Immaculate Conception.\\" In 1905, Tétreault took religious vows for the first time and the religious name of Mother Marie of the Holy Spirit. In 1909, the first six Sisters of the new congregation left for Canton, China. Within a short time, several convents opened throughout Quebec to provide support for the missions of the congregation. In 1920, they launched a missionary review, Le Précurseur. On 2 February 1921 the school of formation for the foreign missions began to operate. By 1933, the foundress had established 36 communities of the Missionary Sisters in Canada, China, Japan and the Philippines. In 1933, Tétreault became seriously ill. She died on 1 October 1941 and her body lay in state for four days at the motherhouse of the congregation. Approximately one thousand people came to pray over her remains. She was buried in the cemetery on the grounds of the motherhouse on 7 October. ==Veneration== In 1958 the first steps were taken to obtain Tétreault's beatification by the Vatican. In 1982, Cardinal Paul Grégoire, then the Archbishop of Montreal, approved the process in view of the introduction of the cause in Rome. The canonical closure of the diocesan proceedings took place in 1997 and the cause was accepted by Rome for further study. Presently the Missionary Sisters of the Immaculate Conception are in 13 countries and of 17 nationalities, including 582 professed sisters and 87 sisters in initial formation. ==References== Category:1865 births Category:1941 deaths Category:People from Montérégie Category:Founders of Catholic religious communities Category:Canadian Roman Catholic religious sisters and nuns Category:Female Roman Catholic missionaries Category:Burials in Quebec Category:Venerated Catholics by Pope John Paul II Category:Canadian Roman Catholic missionaries Category:Roman Catholic missionaries in Canada ","title":"Delia Tetreault"},{"id":"9070853","text":"Jigozen is a Hiroden station on Hiroden Miyajima Line, located in Jigozen, Hatsukaichi, Hiroshima. ==Routes== From Jigozen Station, there is one of Hiroden Streetcar routes. *28px Hiroshima Station - Hiroden-miyajima-guchi Route ==Connections== ;█ Miyajima Line :28px ::JA Hiroshimabyoin-mae — Jigozen — Ajina-higashi ==Around station== *Jigozen Fishing Port *Jigozen Shrine - the position of Mōri clan for Battle of Miyajima ==History== *Opened on July 15, 1925. ==See also== *Hiroden Streetcar Lines and Routes Jigozen Station Category:Railway stations in Japan opened in 1925 ","title":"Jigozen Station"},{"id":"9070870","text":"Satan's Circus is the fourth studio album by Death in Vegas, released on 11 October 2004 on Drone Records in the United Kingdom and on 24 May 2005 on Sanctuary Records in the United States.

General view of the northern facade. View from the town hall. Boim Chapel. Detail of the facade. The composition \\"Descent from the Cross\\" The Boim Chapel (, ) is a monument of religious architecture in Cathedral Square, Lviv, Ukraine. It was constructed from 1609 to 1615 and is part of Lviv's Old Town, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. ==History== The chapel was built for the Boim family on the territory of a contemporary urban cemetery near the Latin Cathedral. The Boims came to Lviv (, then in the Kingdom of Poland) from the Kingdom of Hungary. Their national origin is unclear. They were affluent patricians of Catholic background and became polonized. George (Jerzy) Boim () is credited with the foundation of the chapel. The building was finished by his son, Paweł Boim. 14 members of the Boim family are buried there. The chapel was designed by Andrzej Bemer. He followed a simplified diagram of the architecture of the Sigismund's Chapel at the Wawel Cathedral in Kraków with Italians' elements. In the second half of the 18th century, the chapel was replaced by the Lviv cemetery as a burial place for the Boim family. ==Architeсtural features== The chapel combines a variety of stylistic trends. The ornamental decorations are of Dutch origin, while the narrative reliefs resemble, to some degree, those found in central and southern Poland, but seem to be based on German or Dutch graphic models. The sculptor Jan (or Hanusz) Scholtz, who likely was responsible for the second stage of the work, originated from Königsberg. The appearance of the facade and the altar recalls the iconostasis form. The quality of the design and the lack of moderation persists in Kraków active works of Italian masters, but acting example of bourgeois art. The chapel was built on a square plan and is covered by a paneled dome based on an octagonal tambour. On the chapel lantern rises on eight fluted pilasters with Corinthian capitals, covered again with a small dome, having a statue of Christ on top. ==External appearance== The walls of the chapel are focused according to the sides of the world. Entablature creates the external appearance of the walls, which revolves around them, breaking down in accordance with their relief. The southern side is closed with a residential house, which is attached to the chapel. It was built in the 19th century. The eastern wall is divided by five pilasters and decorated with two mural portraits of Georgy Boim and his wife, Jadwiga. The portraits were created in 1617, by Jan Gianni. The northern wall is also divided by pilasters. Two fresco images are located there: the Virgin and Jesus Christ. A bas-relief of Saint George (the name saint of Georgy Boim) fighting the dragon is situated on the wall of the octagonal tambour. ===Western wall=== The façade’s decorations are attributed to Andrzej Bemer. The western wall is considered to be the most important. It includes a great amount of decorative elements. The whole façade is covered densely with figures and ornamental sculptures, made of sandstone. The facade is divided with cartouche frieze and cornice on two parts. The upper part is decorated with two corinthian columns. The lower part is decorated with six corinthian columns. It also includes the statues of the Apostles Peter and Paul, which are located in the niches on both sides, with the prophets’ circular medallions over the door, windows and niches. Though this façade demonstrates the impression of exaggeration and manners. In the second tier of the cartouche above sculpture’s images of the prophets are located the quotes from the Bible in Latin (on the facade from left to right): * «Morte turpissima condemnemus / eum sapi I» (\\"Condemn him to death shameful\\" (Bk. Wisdom 2.20) - above St. Peter; * «Foderunt manus meos et pedes meos / DA Psal. XXI » (\\"They pierced my hands and my feet\\" (Psalm. 22 (21). 17); * «Corpus meum dedi percucientibus et genas vellentibus / Esai. L »(« I gave my back to those who hits, and my cheeks to those who pinches\\" (Isaiah 50.6); * «Mittamus lignum in panem eius. Et eradamus eum de terra viventium / Ier: XI » (\\"Cut down the tree with its fruit, and cut off it from the land of living \\" (Jeremiah 11.19)); * «Et post hebdomadas LXII occidetur Christus / DAN. IX » (\\"And after 62 weeks Messiah shall be cut off \\"(Daniel 9.26); * «Et appenderunt mercedem meam XXX argenteos / Zach XI» (\\"So they weighed my wages - thirty pieces of silver\\" (Zechariah 11.12) - the entrance; * In Virga percutien [t] maxillam ivdicis / Mich. V. (\\"Rod upon the judge’s cheek\\" (Micah 4.14)) - the entrance; * «Et dicent non est Rex Noster / Ose X» (\\"And they say, We have no king\\" (Hosea 10.3) - above St. Paul. The third tier has many relief images. It contains compositions, dedicated to the Passion of Christ: \\"Castigate\\", \\"Carrying the Christ,\\" \\"Crucifixion\\", \\"Withdrawal of Christ.\\" Due to the expressiveness these compositions and the interior’s composition are called \\"Bible of the poor\\". As it does not need to know the letters, to understand the essence. ==Chapel interior== The interior of the chapel includes four stone figures of prophets, located in the altar, which resembles some images on frieze. The whole plastic decoration is made of stucco. A special attention is paid to pendentives and the dome. On the pendentives, which have the rich framing of the telescopes from both sides. This framing consists of a flat - convex brass motifs and medallions with heads of angels, the same type as on the frieze external. On the pendentives there are angels, which hold cartouches with images of divinities, coats of arms and house marks. Beneath them there are figurines of patrons, both founders: St. Stanislaus and Adalbert of Prague. The majority of sculptures of the chapel’s interior are made by Hans Ficher. The dome is divided into 36 rectangular panels, recessed in three rows. They fill the figures of Christ, the apostles, prophets, angels with instruments of the Passion Pańzkiej and saints. At the top of the dome there is the octagonal lantern light. This arrangement gives the impression of a much bigger height chapel than it actually is. Three round windows provide chapel’s interior lighting. Two of them are situated at the top of the northern wall and another — under the dome of the octagonal lantern light on the western facade. Additional lighting is provided by four lower tier of the lower windows of the main facade.

George was born in Hungerford in Berkshire in 1774, the son of John Pocock, a cabinet- maker in that town, and his wife, Mary. In adulthood, he moved to Bristol where he became a schoolteacher. Pocock was interested in kites from an early age, and experimented with pulling loads using kite power, gradually progressing from small stones to planks and large loads. He taught at a school in Prospect Place, Bristol and continued his experiments with his pupils. By 1820 he had determined that in combination they could support considerable weight and began experimenting with man-lifting kites. In 1824, he used a 30-foot (9 m) kite with a chair rig to lift his daughter, Martha (the future mother of cricketer W.G. Grace) over 270 feet (82 m) into the air. Later the same year and continuing to use his family as subjects, he lifted his son to the top of a cliff outside Bristol; his son briefly dismounted from the chair at the top of the 200-foot (60 m) cliff and then concluded the test by releasing a clip on the kite line which allowed him to slide down the line in the chair and return to earth. Having concluded that kites were capable of lifting humans, he turned again to experimenting with them as a way of pulling loads, this time as a method of pulling vehicles. Using kites in various arrangements he determined that a small number of large kites were capable of pulling a carriage with passengers. Charvolants travelling in various directions with the same Wind (1827), a romanticised view of mass transportation by Charvolant. In 1826, he patented the design of his \\"Charvolant\\" buggy. This used two kites on single line 1,500 to 1,800 feet (457-459 m) long to provide enough power to draw along a buggy carrying several passengers at considerable speed, similar to the modern sport of kite buggying. In his book, The Aeropleustic Art or Navigation in the Air by the use of Kites, or Buoyant Sails, Pocock records that it performed at the rate of 20 miles an hour (32 km/h) over considerable distances and that a mile could frequently be covered even over heavy roads in 2¾ minutes. A group of three Charvolants made a trip of 113 miles (182 km) together, and on a run between Bristol and Marlborough one of the buggies sailed past the mail coach, which at the time was the fastest passenger transport. On another trip, a Charvolant passed the coach of the Duke of Gloucester, a breach of etiquette that was considered so rude that the occupants had to stop to let the Duke pass them. Four control lines to the kite provided a method of steering; these lines were paid out or drawn in from large spools mounted on the front of the carriage. Large wheels allowed the carriage to utilise the power from the kites effectively. In addition to controlling the kites, the driver had to steer the carriage by means of a T-bar which controlled the direction of the front wheels, and was responsible for the brake, an iron bar mounted on the carriage which dug into the road when the lever was pulled. Controlling the Charvolant was difficult, and this may have been why it never became successful commercially, even though it escaped the tolls levied on the roads for horse-drawn carriages: tolls were applied according to the number of horses and since the Charvolant had none it incurred no charge. Pocock advocated other uses for kites in his book, including auxiliary sail power for ships (similar to modern traction kites), a means of dropping anchor and effecting rescues from shipwrecks. He also used his book to advertise other of his inventions, including a celestial globe for viewing the stars that a teacher and pupils could stand inside. He died of bronchitis at his home in Bristol on 9 November 1843. ==References== * * * Category:People from Hungerford Category:People from Bristol Category:18th-century Methodist ministers Category:19th-century Methodist ministers Category:English Methodist ministers Category:Schoolteachers from Gloucestershire Category:English kite fliers Category:English inventors Category:1796 births Category:1843 deaths ","title":"George Pocock (inventor)"},{"id":"9070951","text":"The Manhattan was a United States whaling ship under Captain Mercator Cooper that made the first authorized visit of an American ship to Tokyo Bay, in 1845. ==Events in Japan== The Manhattan left the whaling port Sag Harbor, New York on November 9, 1843. On March 14–15, 1845, its crew rescued 22 shipwrecked Japanese sailors in the Bonin Islands. The first 11 sailors were found on Tori-shima, where Manhattan anchored to hunt for turtles to supplement the ship's provisions, and were survivors from the Koho-maru wrecked en route to Edo. The next day 11 more sailors were found on a foundering Japanese boat Senju-maru (along with a detailed navigation map of Japan).A Cold Welcome in Japan; When a ship sailed into Tokyo's bay, it was met with curiosity and hostility, by Bill Bleyer, Newsday - Long Island Our Story Newsday, January 30, 2011, p. G6, specifies Bonin Islands. The Rotarian of May 1974, however, says the ship was near the Izu Islands, which are much closer to Tokyo Bay. The Manhattan set sail for Edo to repatriate the sailors. Outside Edo Bay four of the survivors took a Japanese boat with a message that Cooper wanted to deliver the remainder to the harbor.The cited Newsday article says four shipwreck survivors went ashore to deliver the message. However the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State thesis Commodore Perry’s 1853 Japanese Expedition: How Whaling Influenced the Event that Revolutionized Japan, by Terry Burcin, says that Cooper went ashore with two of the shipwrecked Japanese and explored the coast and then returned to his ship to await word. The Japanese normally wanted to avoid contact with outsiders due to the Tokugawa shogunate's official policy of national isolation. However, on April 18, 1845, an emissary from the shogunate gave the ship permission to proceed. \\"About three hundred Japanese boats with about 15 men in each took the ship in tow\\", according to Cooper's log. \\"They took all our arms out to keep till we left. There were several of the nobility came on board to see the ship. They appeared very friendly.\\" Japanese accounts place the anchorage of Manhattan at Uraga, at the mouth of Tokyo Bay. It had been over 220 years since so many foreigners had been so close to the Japanese metropolis, but no one from the vessel was permitted to actually land in Japan. The Japanese examined his ship and took particular note of Pyrrhus Concer, a crewman from Southampton, Long Island, who was the only African American on board, and of a Shinnecock Native American named Eleazar. They were the first dark skinned men the Japanese had seen and they wanted to touch their skin. The interpreter from the Japanese side was Moriyama Einosuke, who would later serve during the Perry Expedition. The Japanese refused payment for provisions and gave the ship water, 20 sacks of rice, two sacks of wheat, a box of flour, 11 sacks of sweet potatoes, 50 fowl, two cords of wood, radishes and 10 pounds of tea, and a set of lacquer bowls for the captain, together with a letter from the Shogun. They thanked the Manhattan's crew for returning the shipwrecked sailors and told them to never return, not even to bring back more castaways, on pain of death. On April 21, 500 small boats towed the Manhattan 20 miles out to sea. ==Aftermath== Cooper took with him the map that charted the islands of Japan that had been found on the disabled Japanese ship. He turned it over to the United States government when the ship returned to Sag Harbor on October 14, 1846. News of Cooper's encounter was extensively publicized in the United States. Matthew Perry was said to have used the map on his visit to Japan on July 8, 1853.

Sur. Consultado el 26 de octubre de 2015. As a child, Albert spent several summers in Cútar. Over the years, most of his maternal family also moved to Catalonia, except for his grandfather Lucas Díaz, who had been the first to emigrate in the 1960s to France and then to Switzerland. Eventually his parents' opened their own business and moved to live in La Ametlla, where they sent their son to the private la Escola Cervetó school. He won the Catalan swimming championships at the age of 16 and played for the Granollers water polo team. He went on to study law at ESADE, part of the Ramon Llull University, completing the degree in 2001. He completed a master's degree in constitutional law from the same institution in 2002. He also studied for one year at the University of Helsinki in Finland, as part of an Erasmus scholarship. He has also taken a course at the George Washington University in political marketing. After starting his degree in law, he began to be interested in politics by taking part in a debating competition. ==Professional career== Once he completed his university studies, Rivera began working as a legal counsel at the La Caixa savings bank in 2003. He stopped working for La Caixa in 2006 when he became the president of Citizens. ==Political career== Rivera was elected as the president of Citizens during their founding conference in July 2006. He was re-elected as president again in 2007 and 2011. Rivera was first elected to the Parliament of Catalonia in the 2006 regional election, and remained a member until he stepped down before the 2015 parliamentary election. Launching the Citizen's campaign for the Parliament of Catalonia in 2006, Rivera published a number of leaflets where he posed naked alongside the caption: \\"We don't care where you were born. We don't care which language you speak. We don't care what kind of clothes you wear. We care about you\\". Rivera, and the wider Citizens party, are opposed to Catalan independence. In 2017, he was invited to the annual meeting of the Bilderberg Group, which took place on June 1 in Chantilly, Virginia. On 11 November 2019, after the large electoral setback suffered by Citizens on the snap general election the day before, losing over 80% of its seats in the Congress and one-third of its seats in the Senate, Rivera resigned from his position as president of the party and left politics entirely to focus on his personal life. == Positions == After abandoning his early stance on the loosening of the \\"prisión permanente revisable\\" (permanent revisable prison), Rivera has hardened his positions in terms of the fulfillment of criminal sentences with some of his proposed measures in the matter being described as a case of \\"punitive populism\\".

The Center facilitates discussions between academia and the public, creates and strengthens transatlantic networks. The HCA offers B.A., M.A., and Ph.D programs in American studies. Students are competitively selected, receive first class education and are mentored by highly qualified professors/scholars. == Higher education == The University of Heidelberg introduced the MA in American Studies (MAS) at the HCA in 2004. The Establishment of a MAS program was the first order of Business for the HCA. It is a 4-semester program which admits up to 20 students per year, and it attracts talented and ambitious graduate students from multinational backgrounds. The program's curriculum includes classes in economics, geography, history, literary and cultural studies, political science, and religious history; it is one of the few American Studies programs in Germany with a curriculum that includes economics. In 2006, the HCA commenced its Ph.D. in American Studies program. It is a structured three-year English- language, tuition free program, open to German and international applicants. The program equips candidates with skills needed to conduct independent scholarly research in the fields of American history, politics, literature and culture, geography, and religion. Students pursuing a degree in other disciplines can apply to the Ph.D. in American Studies program if their research project is strongly related to the United States. Graduates of the program are awarded either a “Doktor der Philosophie (Dr. phil.)” or a “Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.)” degree. The HCA supports individual doctoral projects as well as international and interdisciplinary research cooperation. In 2010, the HCA introduced an instantaneously successful program for undergraduate students- BA in American Studies (BAS). The BAS program is a competitive, multi-disciplinary and interdisciplinary program which admits up to 25 students yearly, and places a strong emphasis on intense one-to-one assistance/mentoring. The BAS program is notable for providing students the option to specialize in geography or religious studies, and obtain an additional legal certification.

Some of the main research projects undertaken by the institute include \\"Authority and Trust in American Culture, Society, History, and Politics\\", \\"Mobile Spaces: Urban Practices in Transcultural Perspective\\", and \\"Protest, Culture, and Society: Europe and North America\\" Since 2004, the institute has run an annual HCA Spring Academy. HCA Spring Academy is a week- long conference attracting Ph.D candidates with research projects on the United States. The principal aim of the Spring Academy is to establish an international network of Ph.D. students in the field of American studies. From 2004-2017, the HCA Spring Academy hosted 289 PhD candidates from Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, the Middle-East, North America, and South-Central America. The HCA established the Spring Academy Network for American Studies in 2009, to further strengthen participants' ability to collaborate/network after the Spring Academy. John Deere has been an important partner and supporter of the annual HCA Spring Academy since 2005. HCA Spring Academy Alumni occupy various academic positions in reputable academic institutions, are excelling in various fields, and influencing change, nationally and internationally. Since 2010, the institute has awarded the \\"Rolf Kentner Dissertation Prize\\" to Ph.D candidates with outstanding work in the field of American studies. The dissertation prize is sponsored by Rolf Kentner, the chairman of the Schurman Society for American History, and each year, a winner is endowed with 1,000 Euros In 2011, the HCA and the Faculty of Theology in Heidelberg University established the James W.C. Pennington Award. The 44th president of the United States, Barack Obama sent official greetings to the HCA expressing his gratitude for the initiative which pays tribute to Pennington and recognizes scholars who have done distinguished work on topics important to Pennington. The award is presented to scholars after a month-long stay in Heidelberg to engage in research and discuss topics such as slavery, emancipation, peace, education, reform, civil rights, religion, and intercultural understanding Albert J. Raboteau was the first recipient of the award. In 2012, the Jonathan Edwards Center Germany was established. The center is a partnership between the University of Heidelberg's Department of Theology, the HCA, and Jonathan Edwards Center at the Yale Divinity School The goal of Jonathan Edwards Center Germany is to promote research and teaching on early American religious history, Jonathan Edwards, the tradition of New England Puritanism, and Edward's legacy in contemporary Christianity == Forum for public debate == As a forum for public debate, the HCA facilitates discussions between the academic community, the general public, the business community, the political sphere, and the media. The HCA presents current research in the field of American Studies to the public through lecture series and its Baden- Württemberg Seminar which began in the spring of 2007 as a lecture series with fellows of the American Academy in Berlin. In 2009, the HCA assumed full responsibility for the Baden-Württemberg Seminar which takes place each Spring and Fall. The HCA invites distinguished scholars, public policy experts, journalists, writers, and artists to present their current work, discuss issues of transatlantic interest, or read from their writings at selected institutions throughout the state of Baden-Württemberg. Since 2011, HCA has organized a yearly Spring exhibition of works pertinent to American history, culture, literature, and politics. Some of the exhibitions include \\"Behind Barbed Wire – Prisoners of War in the United States and Germany\\" which shed light on the lives of German and American Prisoners of War (POW) during World War II and \\"Black Cowboys, German Indians\\" which features photographs of Black Cowboys and Native Americans/German Indians. Exhibited materials/works are made available for individuals from all walks of life to observe and educate themselves on the American society. The HCA regularly hosts lectures and lecture series as well as keynote addresses on U.S. affairs and transatlantic relations. A lecture series \\"Typisch Amerikanisch\\" (“Typically American”) was offered every winter from 2002 to 2006. Annual series were organized around a central theme, such as foreign policy, multiculturalism, or the economy of the United States. == Development and goals == The institution aims to maintain its reputation as an institute for higher education, a center for interdisciplinary research, a forum for public debate, and an exceptional contributor to interdisciplinary academic and cultural expertise on the United States in Europe. == References == == External links == * Homepage of the Heidelberg Center for American Studies * University of Heidelberg University of Heidelberg * \\"Amerika-Haus Heidelberg - DAI\\" Category:American studies Category:American culture Category:Historiography of the United States Category:Cultural studies organizations Category:Organizations established in 2003 Category:Heidelberg University ","title":"Heidelberg Center for American Studies"},{"id":"9071016","text":"Daniel \\"Dani\\" Löble (born 22 February 1973) is a Swiss-German drummer, who has been a member of German power metal band Helloween since 2005. ==Biography== Dani began his career with Rawhead Rexx, a band that he helped form but departed due to his new commitments to Helloween.

Bilateral trade agreements often aim to keep trade deficits at minimum by keeping a clearing account where deficit would accumulate. The Soviet Union conducted bilateral trade with two nations, India and Finland. On the Soviet side, the trade was nationalized, but on the other side, also private capitalists negotiated deals. Relationships with politicians in charge of foreign policy were especially important for such businessmen. The framework limited the traded goods to those manufactured domestically and as such, constituted a subsidy to domestic industry. Bilateral trade was highly popular within Finnish business circles, as it allowed the commission of very large orders, additionally with less stringent requirements for sophistication or quality, if compared to Western markets. The Soviet side was motivated to participate in clearing trade because the arrangement essentially provided cheap credit. The option was to sell obligations to the international market, and pay interest in hard currency. Capital, such as icebreakers, train carriages or consumer goods, could be obtained from Finland, and the cost would simply become clearing account deficit, eventually to be paid back as e.g. crude oil, or as orders such as nuclear power plants (Loviisa I and II). Clearing trade was at its busiest up to the 1970s, but began to lose its momentum in the 1980s. In the last of its years, the Soviet Union's debt began accumulating on an alarming rate into clearing accounts. As a result, the Soviet Union started to pay the deficits with oil, a good with little value added and easily exchangeable to hard currency, which militated against the principle of bilateral trade. With the dissolution of the Soviet Union, this form of trade has mostly disappeared. Bilateral trade is a manifestation of bilateral-ism; in contrast, multilateral ism and in particular multilateral trade agreements became more important. Strategic goods, such as nuclear technology, are still traded bilaterally rather than in a multilateral open market ==See also== *Bilateral trade agreement *Multilateral exchange == References == * Juri Piskulov: Näin teimme idänkauppaa.

ClickShift's technology was integrated into Webtrends' Marketing Lab suite, which includes its analytics and marketing warehouse products. The offering was re-branded as Webtrends Dynamic Search. In August 2008, the product was relaunched as Webtrends Ad Director. Webtrends acquired Seattle based Widemile, a provider of multivariate testing and targeting on July 30, 2009. The product was rebranded and relaunched as Webtrends Optimize the day the acquisition was made public. Webtrends acquired San Francisco based Transpond, a maker of social microsites and applications that can be distributed over the web or Facebook, on August 10, 2010. The product was rebranded as Webtrends Apps at the time of the announcement and was later rebranded as Webtrends Social. Webtrends acquired Reinvigorate from Culver City, CA based Media Temple Ventures. Reinvigorate developed a real time analytics web product with visit heat mapping technologies. The product was rebranded as Webtrends Reinvigorate and later discontinued. ==Products== Webtrends offers a variety of web analytics products and services which focus on the collection and presentation of user behavior data for websites and mobile device applications. The New York Times described the company's offerings as \\"products that analyze spending by Web site visitors.\\" The core product, Webtrends Analytics, is available in both software and software as a service (SaaS) models. Over the years, Webtrends has released a number of SaaS products including Webtrends Segments, Webtrends Optimize, Action Center, Webtrends Streams and Webtrends Ads. A 2012 \\"integration\\" deal linked WebTrends and Hootsuite. Their 2013-released Email remarketing tool helps online marketers deal with in-the- moment data about abandonment of virtual shopping carts by potential customers. In February 2015, Webtrends Completed the worldwide rollout of Webtrends Explore, their ad-hoc analytics application. In 2016, Webtrends announced it would release a new analytics product, Webtrends Infinity Analytics; a year later they sold it to Oracle. On 1st August 2018, a management buy-out saw their testing/personalisation offering Webtrends Optimize spin off into its own company. It became headquartered in the UK, and headed up by the former Director of Optimisation Services Matthew Smith, who took the new role of CEO. Following the split, the Optimize product rebranded, re-platformed, and has been operating on its own ever since. ===Data collection=== Their software uses log file analysis and page tagging. Log analysis reads the files in which the web server records all its transactions. Via page tagging, parameter name-value pairs are appended (either automatically by a JavaScript \\"tag\\" or manual hand-coding) to the query string of a gif image which resides on a data collection server. When a visitor loads the page in a browser, the browser sends a request to the data collection server so that it may load the gif image. The data collection server receives the request and logs the parameters included in the query string of the gif image. The software analyzes and organizes the captured data into reports for each configured 'Profile'. Reports are viewable by various means, most commonly through a web-based graphic user interface or a scheduled emailed export of the report in PDF or csv format. Collected data can also be viewed via raw log file delivery, REST and ODBC queries, and other products which use the Webtrends Data Extraction API. The web-based report presentation interface is highly configurable, allowing a Webtrends administrator to specify what information should be analyzed, where it should be presented, and to whom it should be available for viewing. In 2008 the New York Times, which then already owned the International Herald Tribune, used WebTrends to analyze how visitors to the IHT site arrived. The above data collection process facilitated finding out the importance of search engines. ==References== Category:1993 establishments in Oregon Category:Companies based in Portland, Oregon Category:Companies established in 1993 Category:Privately held companies based in Oregon Category:Software companies of the United States Category:Web analytics ","title":"Webtrends"},{"id":"9071073","text":"The Rio Omerê Indigenous Territory in Rondônia.

UVF and YCV emblems on a mural referencing the 1994 ceasefire called by the CLMC. The name Protestant Action Force (PAF) was used by loyalists, especially members of the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), to claim responsibility for a number of paramilitary attacks during the Troubles.CAIN Web Service Abstracts on Organisations It was first used in this context in 1974, and has since been used to claim the killings of at least 41 Catholic civilians.Sutton Index of Deaths: Crosstabulations (choose \\"organisation\\" and \\"status\\") It has been suggested that PAF was a covername used by a semi-independent group (or groups) within the UVF who were carrying out attacks on their own initiative or without the sanction of the UVF leadership. Almost all of the attacks claimed by the PAF took place in North Belfast/Newtownabbey and the area of County Armagh/Tyrone known as the \\"murder triangle\\". The name was first used during 1974–1976. All of the attacks in Armagh/Tyrone during this period have been linked to the Glenanne gang. This was a group comprising members of the Mid Ulster UVF, British soldiers from the Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR), and police officers from the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC). The name was revived in 1982. In the 1980s, the PAF claimed about 15 attacks in the Belfast area and two in Armagh. UDR soldiers were convicted of the two Armagh attacks. The PAF claimed its last attacks in the early 1990s. All were in north Armagh and there have been allegations of security force involvement in them. On 24 November 1974, shortly after the name first appeared, an interview with three unidentified men was published in the Sunday World. They claimed to represent a loyalist group that had existed since 1971, was made up of former British soldiers and had killed 28 people in the past two months. When asked if they belonged to the PAF they replied \\"no comment\\". Later in the interview they stated: \\"You can say we are members of the Mid-Ulster unit of the Protestant Task Force\\".First Barron Report (2003), pp.45-47 Former British Intelligence officer Colin Wallace claimed that the three men were known to British Intelligence and were involved in the Dublin-Monaghan bombings,First Barron Report (2003), p.174 which has been linked to the Glenanne gang. In a September 1975 letter, Wallace states that most of the loyalist killings in Armagh/Tyrone in 1975, including the Miami Showband killings, were carried out by the Protestant Task Force or PTF. He states there are rumours the group is linked to the Special Duties Team based at British Army HQ in Lisburn. This was a team of British soldiers involved in undercover operations.Transcripts of a 27 September 2006 public hearing on the Fourth Barron Report.

The western segment begins at the South Dakota border northwest of Crawford and ends southeast of Grand Island at an intersection with Interstate 80. The eastern segment begins in Lincoln and ends at the Iowa border at Nebraska City. Previously, the two segments were connected via a route shared with U.S. Highway 34 between Grand Island and Lincoln. ==Route descriptionWestern segment=== The western segment of NE 2 begins at the South Dakota border north of Crawford in a concurrency with Nebraska Highway 71. The road goes east, southeast, and then south into Crawford. In Crawford, there is a concurrency with U.S. Highway 20. Highway 2 and 71 both continue south from Crawford through Marsland, Nebraska. The two highways split west of Hemingford, Nebraska and NE 2 turns east towards Hemingford. At Hemingford, NE 2 turns southeast towards Alliance. At Berea, NE 2 meets U.S. Highway 385 and the two overlap into Alliance. At Alliance, NE 2 goes east into the Sand Hills. It goes through several small towns, including Hyannis, Mullen and Thedford. In Thedford, NE 2 briefly overlaps U.S. Highway 83. East of Thedford, near Halsey, is the Nebraska National Forest. At Dunning, NE 2 intersects Nebraska Highway 91 and turns southeasterly towards Broken Bow and Grand Island. After turning southeasterly at Dunning, NE 2 meets Nebraska Highway 92 in Merna. The two highways overlap through Broken Bow and separate when they meet U.S. Highway 183 in Ansley. NE 2 meets Nebraska Highway 10 in Hazard, Nebraska Highway 68 in Ravenna and Nebraska Highway 11 in Cairo. On the northwest edge of Grand Island, NE 2 becomes a 4 lane divided highway and then encounters U.S. Highway 281. NE 2 then follows US 281 along the western edge of Grand Island until it meets U.S. Highway 34 and then those two routes overlap through the southern edge of Grand Island. NE 2 and US 34 cross the Platte River and shortly thereafter, they separate and NE 2 turns south towards Interstate 80. At I-80, the western segment of NE 2 ends. ===Eastern segment=== The eastern segment of Nebraska Highway 2 begins in the southwestern part of Lincoln at an intersection with U.S. Highway 77. In Lincoln, NE 2 follows Van Dorn St. until it meets the south-north pair of 9th St. and 10th St. It then makes a turn south and then southeast along Nebraska Highway and becomes a 4 lane divided highway, which it will become for the rest of its length. Along this part of the highway is the headquarters of the Nebraska State Patrol, Nebraska Department of Roads and Nebraska State Penitentiary. NE 2 eventually leaves Lincoln and encounters several small towns and highways. It meets Nebraska Highway 43 north of Bennet and overlaps it for , until shortly before Palmyra. Near Syracuse, there is a bypass of that community and there is a freeway exit for Nebraska Highway 50. It continues east and near Nebraska City, it meets U.S. Highway 75 and the two highways are together briefly until the southern edge of Nebraska City. Also at this intersection, Business Route 2 begins and goes through Nebraska City. After they separate, NE 2 heads east and then northeast, meets the eastern end of Business Route 2 and crosses the Missouri River over the Nebraska City Bridge and enters Iowa. In Iowa, the highway continues as Iowa Highway 2. The eastern segment of NE 2 serves as part of a connecting route, along with U.S. Highway 77, between Interstate 29 in Iowa and Interstate 80 in Lincoln. It allows traffic coming from Kansas City, Missouri to go to Lincoln and points west of Lincoln to bypass Omaha. The eastern segment of Nebraska Highway 2 has the commemorative name of Jerome and Betty Warner Memorial Highway. The portion of the highway east of the west U.S. 75 junction to the Nebraska City Bridge in the Nebraska City area is known as the J. Sterling Morton Beltway, in honor of the creator of Arbor Day and the former Secretary of Agriculture. ==Major intersections== ==See also== ==References== ==External links== * Nebraska Roads: NE 1-10 002 Category:Transportation in Sioux County, Nebraska Category:Transportation in Dawes County, Nebraska Category:Transportation in Box Butte County, Nebraska Category:Transportation in Sheridan County, Nebraska Category:Transportation in Grant County, Nebraska Category:Transportation in Hooker County, Nebraska Category:Transportation in Thomas County, Nebraska Category:Transportation in Blaine County, Nebraska Category:Transportation in Custer County, Nebraska Category:Transportation in Sherman County, Nebraska Category:Transportation in Buffalo County, Nebraska Category:Transportation in Hall County, Nebraska Category:Transportation in Merrick County, Nebraska Category:Transportation in Hamilton County, Nebraska Category:Transportation in Lincoln, Nebraska Category:Transportation in Otoe County, Nebraska ","title":"Nebraska Highway 2"},{"id":"9071225","text":"Hawkfest is three-day outdoor weekend festival organised and centered on Hawkwind.

It has grey upperparts and largely grey-pink underparts, and is distinguished by a striking and diagnostic complete black collar against an otherwise white throat. ==Distribution and habitat== The collared imperial pigeon occurs in northern and southern New Guinea and the Aru Islands. It has also been recorded from Boigu and Saibai islands. It may visit the northern Torres Strait islands as a vagrant. It inhabits lowland rainforest, swamp forest, mangroves and riverine vegetation. ==Taxonomy== The binomial commemorates the German naturalist Salomon Müller. There are two recognized subspecies: the nominate D. m. mullerii (Temminck, 1835), in lowland southern New Guinea, including the offshore islands of Boigu, Saibai and Daru, and the Aru Islands; and D. m. aurantia (A. B. Meyer, 1893) in northern New Guinea, from Bintuni Bay and the east shore of Geelvink Bay to Astrolabe Bay. ==Diet== The pigeon principally feeds on fruit from forest trees and insects. In the Port Moresby area, the main food during June/July was reported to be fruit of Tristiropsis canarioides which made up nearly half the diet. Some 30% of food volume were ylang-ylang (Cananga odorata) fruit, the remainder being various Arecaceae (palm) fruits. Food is swallowed whole, and fruits thus eaten may have a diameter of up to 5 cm. ==Nesting== The species lays a single egg on a flimsy platform nest in forest tree adjoining wetland. ==References== * Higgins, P.J.; & Davies, S.J.J.F.

Diagram of axicon and resulting Bessel beam Cross- section of the Bessel beam and graph of intensity Bessel beam re-forming central bright area after obstruction A Bessel beam is a wave whose amplitude is described by a Bessel function of the first kind. Electromagnetic, acoustic, gravitational, and matter waves can all be in the form of Bessel beams. A true Bessel beam is non-diffractive. This means that as it propagates, it does not diffract and spread out; this is in contrast to the usual behavior of light (or sound), which spreads out after being focused down to a small spot. Bessel beams are also self-healing, meaning that the beam can be partially obstructed at one point, but will re-form at a point further down the beam axis. As with a plane wave, a true Bessel beam cannot be created, as it is unbounded and would require an infinite amount of energy. Reasonably good approximations can be made, however, and these are important in many optical applications because they exhibit little or no diffraction over a limited distance. Approximations to Bessel beams are made in practice either by focusing a Gaussian beam with an axicon lens to generate a Bessel–Gauss beam, by using axisymmetric diffraction gratings, or by placing a narrow annular aperture in the far field. High order Bessel beams can be generated by spiral diffraction gratings. ==Properties== The properties of Bessel beams make them extremely useful for optical tweezing, as a narrow Bessel beam will maintain its required property of tight focus over a relatively long section of beam and even when partially occluded by the dielectric particles being tweezed. Similarly, particle manipulation with acoustical tweezers was achieved D. Baresch, J.L. Thomas, and R. Marchiano, Physical review letters, 2016, 116(2), 024301.with a Bessel beam that scatters and produces a radiation force resulting from the exchange of acoustic momentum between the wave-field and a particle placed along its path. The mathematical function which describes a Bessel beam is a solution of Bessel's differential equation, which itself arises from separable solutions to Laplace's equation and the Helmholtz equation in cylindrical coordinates. The fundamental zero-order Bessel beam has an amplitude maximum at the origin, while a high-order Bessel beam (HOBB) has an axial phase singularity along the beam axis; the amplitude is zero there. HOBBs can be of vortex (helicoidal) or non-vortex types. X-waves are special superpositions of Bessel beams which travel at constant velocity, and can exceed the speed of light. Mathieu beams and parabolic (Weber) beams are other types of non-diffractive beams that have the same non-diffractive and self-healing properties of Bessel beams but different transverse structures. ===Acceleration=== In 2012 it was theoretically proven and experimentally demonstrated that, with a special manipulation of their initial phase, Bessel beams can be made to accelerate along arbitrary trajectories in free space. These beams can be considered as hybrids that combine the symmetric profile of a standard Bessel beam with the self-acceleration property of the Airy beam and its counterparts. Previous efforts to produce accelerating Bessel beams included beams with helical and sinusoidal trajectories as well as the early effort for beams with piecewise straight trajectories. === Attenuation- compensation === Beams may encounter losses as they travel through materials which will cause attenuation of the beam intensity. A property common to non- diffracting (or propagation-invariant) beams, such as the Airy beam and Bessel beam, is the ability to control the longitudinal intensity envelope of the beam without significantly altering the other characteristics of the beam. This can be used to create Bessel beams which grow in intensity as they travel and can be used to counteract losses, therefore maintaining a beam of constant intensity as it propagates. == Applications  Imaging and microscopy === In light-sheet fluorescence microscopy, non-diffracting (or propagation- invariant) beams have been utilised to produce very long and uniform light- sheets which do not change size significantly across their length. The self- healing property of Bessel beams has also shown to give improved image quality at depth as the beam shape is less distorted after travelling through scattering tissue than a Gaussian beam. Bessel beam based light-sheet microscopy was first demonstrated in 2010 but many variations have followed since. In 2018, it was shown that the use of attenuation-compensation could be applied to Bessel beam based light-sheet microscopy and could enable imaging at greater depths within biological specimens. === Acoustofluidics === Bessel beams are a good candidate for the selectively trapping because of the concentric circles of pressure maximum and minimum in the transverse planes. ==References== == Further reading == * ==External links== * New microscope captures 3D movies of living cells gizmag.com (switched Bessel beams used effectively in real-time microscopy) * 'Tractor beam' is possible with lasers, say scientists * Ultrasound (zeroth-order) Bessel beam profile - Front cover image (April 2002 Issue of the IEEE Trans.

Buckley (January 22, 1815 – December 19, 1865) was an American politician in Texas who served two non-consecutive terms as Speaker of the Texas House of Representatives between 1861 and 1863. Buckley was born January 22, 1815 in Surry County, North Carolina, but had moved to Georgia by 1828 where he began working as a store clerk. In 1834 in Columbus, Buckley opened a store of his own, which closed after the Panic of 1837. After losing everything, he moved to Houston in the Republic of Texas, where he was a clerk in the State Department. While Buckley worked there, he was tutored in law by Attorney General John Birdsall, which enabled Buckley's admission to the bar in November 1839. Gov. James Pinckney Henderson appointed him a District Judge in 1847, but Buckley resigned in 1854 in order to resume private practice. Buckley was first elected to the Texas House of Representatives from Richmond in 1857. He represented Austin and Fort Bend counties in the Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth Legislatures. On November 4, 1861, at the beginning of the Regular Session of the Ninth Legislature, Buckley was elected Speaker and served until he apparently resigned on December 7, 1861. After Buckley's successor, Nicholas Henry Darnell resigned sometime in 1862,Darnell resigned to fight in the Civil War. Texas Legislature records during the Civil War were spotty at best, and were not even published until the mid-1960s. Buckley was elected to the vacant office of Speaker for the First Called Session that convened on February 2, 1863, defeating Reps.

He had agreed to their use on the album in return for royalties. The 101ers owned the rights to the BBC Maida Vale recordings so they could also be used. However most of the Pathway material recorded by Roger Armstrong was not allowed on. There was one exception: 'Sweet Revenge'. Partly this was a cross promotional idea because Chiswick wanted to release the track as a single when they found out about plans for the album. The other fact is that the 101ers had allowed Roger's use of 'Five Star Rock n Roll Petrol' from the BBC Maida Vale Sessions as the B side for 'Keys to your Heart' on Chiswick's 1976 single. Roger felt honour bound to allow the use of one Pathway track on Elgin Avenue Breakdown.See p.151 of the first edition of 'Last Gang in Town' by Marcus Gray Some observations on the songwriting: 'Usually Woody would come up with the lyrics and an idea for the melody and chords, and then develop it further with Clive, before bringing it to the band room where we would all knock it around until it took final shape.'Taken from p47 of the memoir 'Squat City Rocks' by Richard Dudanski In mid-January 1976 Mole was replaced by Dan Kelleher. Here are a few observations on Dan's contribution: 'Apart from his experience and dexterity on bass, he had other skills to offer. The backing vocals was one area that immediately improved with not just his singing but also with the harmony parts that he arranged, and then there were two or three songs on which he sang lead vocal, which would give Joe a welcome breather at strategic points in the set. He also helped me in working out new drum patterns.'Taken from p89 of the memoir 'Squat City Rocks' by Richard Dudanski The official credits are for Strummer and the 101ers unless otherwise noted. #\\"Letsagetabitarockin'\\" - 2:07 #\\"Silent Telephone\\" - 2:20 #\\"Monkey Business\\" (live) (Chuck Berry) - 2:22 #\\"Shake Your Hips\\" (live) (Slim Harpo) - 3:26 #\\"Junco Partner\\" (live) (Trad. arr.

He received his PhD in 1962, the title of his dissertation was Magnetohydrodynamic Turbulence. ==Career== After completing his PhD, Moffatt joined the staff of the Mathematics Faculty in Cambridge as an Assistant Lecturer and became a Fellow of Trinity College. He was appointed a lecturer in 1964, and held the office of Tutor, then Senior Tutor, at Trinity between 1970 and 1976. In 1977 he was appointed to the Chair of Applied Mathematics at the University of Bristol. He held this position until 1980 when he returned to Cambridge to take up the Chair in Mathematical Physics, renewing his Fellowship of Trinity College. In 2002 he was made an Emeritus Professor of the University (he remains a Fellow of Trinity). In the early 2000s he published papers on the theory of Euler's Disk. Moffatt has published more than 200 papers. ===Appointments=== * DAMTP, University of Cambridge: Assistant Lecturer, 1961–1964; Lecturer, 1964–1976 * Trinity College, Cambridge: Fellow, 1961–76; Tutor, 1970–1974; Senior Tutor, 1975–1976 * Bristol University: Professor of Applied Mathematics, 1977–1980 * DAMTP, University of Cambridge: Professor of Mathematical Physics, 1980–2002; Head of Department, 1983–1991; Emeritus Professor, 2002-- * Trinity College, Cambridge: Fellow, 1980–- * Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences, Cambridge: Director, 1996–2001; Senior Fellow, 2001-- * Editor, Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 1966–1983 * École Polytechnique, Palaiseau: Visiting Professor (professeur d'exercise partiel), 1992–1999 * École Normale Supérieure, Paris: Chaire Internationale de Recherche Blaise Pascal, 2001–2003 * African Institute for Mathematical Sciences, Muizenberg, South Africa: Trustee and Member of Council, 2003 * Leverhulme Emeritus Professor, 2003–2005 * International Union of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (IUTAM): Member of Bureau, 1992–2000; President, 2000–2004; Vice-President, 2004-- ===Honours and awards=== * Fellow of the Royal Society, 1986 * Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, 1987 * Foreign Member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, 1991 * Member of Academia Europæa, 1994 * Foreign Member of the Académie des Sciences, Paris, 1998 * Officier des Palmes académiques, 1998 * Foreign Member of the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei, Rome, 2001 * Panetti- Ferrari International Prize and Gold Medal, Academy of Sciences, Turin, 2001 * Fellow of the American Physical Society, 2003 * Euromech Prize for Fluid Mechanics, 2003 * Caribbean Award for Fluid Dynamics, 2004 * Senior Whitehead Prize of the London Mathematical Society, 2005 * Hughes Medal of the Royal Society, 2005 == Personal life == In 1960 he married Katharine (Linty), and together they had four children, two daughters and two sons, one of whom is deceased. ==References== == Sources == * Home page * Biography * Publications list * CV Category:Living people Category:1935 births Category:Fellows of the Royal Society Category:Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh Category:Fellows of Trinity College, Cambridge Category:People educated at George Watson's College Category:Alumni of the University of Edinburgh Category:Members of Academia Europaea Category:Members of the French Academy of Sciences Category:Members of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences Category:Foreign associates of the National Academy of Sciences Category:David Crighton medalists Category:Fluid dynamicists Category:Cambridge mathematicians Category:Fellows of the American Physical Society ","title":"Keith Moffatt"},{"id":"9071432","text":"The mobile wad (or mobile wad of Henry) is a group of the following three muscles found in the posterior compartment of the forearm:Baek 2004, pp 508–9 * brachioradialis * extensor carpi radialis brevis * extensor carpi radialis longus It is also sometimes known as the \\"lateral compartment\\"DuParc 2003, 55–030–A-10 or \\"radial group\\"Platzer 2004, p 164 of the forearm. == Function == These three muscles act as flexors at the elbow joint.Note: The extensor carpi muscles are so named because they extend at the carpus, not at the elbow.

Longus is a weak pronator in the flexed arm and a supinator in the outstretched arm. At the carpal joints longus acts in dorsiflexion with the extensor carpi ulnaris and in radial abduction with the flexor carpi radialis.

The twelfth named storm and seventh hurricane of the 1992 Pacific hurricane season, Lester formed on August 20 from a tropical wave southwest of Mexico. The tropical storm moved generally northwestward while steadily intensifying. After turning to the north, approaching the Mexican coast, Lester attained hurricane status. The hurricane reached peak winds of 85 mph (140 km/h) before making landfall on west-central Baja California. The system weakened while moving across the peninsula and then over northwestern Mexico. Not long after entering Arizona, Lester weakened to a tropical depression, and degenerated into an extratropical low on August 24, 1992, over New Mexico. The storm's remnants later merged with the remnants of Hurricane Andrew and another frontal system on August 29. In Mexico, the hurricane resulted in $3 million in damage (1992 USD, $4.7 million 2011 USD). It also left 5,000 people homeless, and was responsible for three fatalities. The remnants of Lester also produced moderate rainfall and minor flooding across southern California, Colorado, Arizona, and New Mexico, as well as rare August snow in the Rocky Mountains. ==Meteorological history== A weak tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on August 7. It tracked across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea without development due to strong wind shear. The wave then split into two, with the northern portion dissipating over Cuba on August 15 and the southern portion continuing westward. The wave crossed Central America and entered the Pacific Ocean on August 16. Deep convection increased over the wave upon entering the Pacific, and early on August 19 it started to become better organized. After the development of a low-level circulation, the system organized into Tropical Depression Fourteen-E on August 20 while located about 275 miles (445 km) south-southwest of Manzanillo, Colima. The depression gradually tracked northwestward at 15 mph (24 km/h). Although the center of the depression was initially uncertain, it slowly strengthened and steadily organized. The depression attained tropical storm status late on August 20, upon which the storm was named Lester. The cyclone continued to the northwest, and passed directly over Socorro Island on August 21. By early the next day, an eastward moving trough weakened the ridge to its north, resulting in a to turn to the north. Around this time, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center predicted the storm would not strengthen to hurricane intensity before making landfall. Despite this, Lester intensified into a hurricane late on August 22 while located about 240 miles (385 km) west of La Paz in Baja California Sur. Hurricane Lester and Hurricane Andrew (right) on August 22 The hurricane continued to organize and banding-type eye soon formed. Early on August 23 it attained peak winds of 85 mph (140 km/h) with a minimum central pressure of 985 mbar (hPa; 29.09 inHg). Lester weakened steadily as the storm turned to the northeast, and made landfall as a minimal hurricane near Punta Abreojos, Baja California Sur about ten hours after reaching peak intensity. It degenerated into a tropical storm while crossing the Baja California Peninsula. After passing through the northern Gulf of California, it made a second landfall near Isla Tiburon in the state of Sonora. Lester entered Arizona as a tropical storm on August 24, the first time since Hurricane Katrina in 1967 that an Eastern Pacific tropical cyclone entered the United States with winds of at least tropical storm intensity. Lester maintained tropical storm status until it weakened into a tropical depression near Tucson, Arizona. Later that day, the low-level circulation dissipated over New Mexico, and Lester ceased to exist as a tropical cyclone. The storm's remnants transitioned into an extratropical cyclone, as it continued to the north- northeast, ahead of an approaching trough, and later merged with the remnants of Hurricane Andrew and another frontal system on August 29, over Pennsylvania. ==Preparations and Impact== Rainfall from Hurricane Lester ===Mexico=== The Government of Mexico issued tropical storm watches and warnings for Baja California on August 21. The following day, a hurricane warning was issued for the peninsula from Punta Eugenia southward to Cabo San Lazaro. The government of Mexico also issued a tropical storm warning for the Sonora and Sinaloa mainland from Cabo Tepopa to Los Mochis. All watches and warnings were discontinued as the storm weakened and dissipated. The threat of the hurricane prompted the evacuation of about 10,000 residents. No observations exist for the duration when Lester, as a tropical depression, moved over Socorro Island, while winds were estimated to have reached 37 mph (59 km/h). However, a station reported winds of 23 mph (37 km/h) six hours after Lester passed over Socorro Island. Several ships came in contact with Lester, with one in the eye reporting hurricane-force winds for 11 hours on August 22. The ship in the eye reported rough seas, causing it to roll 33° to each side and thus was responsible for a large amount of cargo to go overboard. Hurricane Lester produced heavy rainfall across its path through the Baja California Peninsula and Sonora. Peak rainfall occurred in Mulege with . A weather station in Presa Rodriquez reported 8.66 inches (203 mm) of precipitation, with several other locations reporting over 2 inches (50 mm). The heavy rainfall caused extensive flood damage to the west of Hermosillo, destroying some entire communities and flooding a large highway. Roads were washed out, and power lines were knocked out. Waves up to were recorded. Flash flooding from Lester caused 10,000 people to be evacuated from their homes. In addition, mudslides killed three people, and left 5,000 homeless. The storm resulted in $3 million (1992 USD), equivalent to $4.7 million (2011 USD). The Mexican Army provided relief efforts to residents after the storm. ===United States=== The remnants of Lester produced heavy rainfall across the Southwestern United States. In Arizona, rainfall amounted to over 5 inches (125 mm) near Phoenix and Tucson, with much of the rest of the state reporting over 1 inch (25 mm). Moderate rainfall was also reported in western New Mexico and southern Utah, while one location in southwestern Colorado reported over 5 inches (125 mm) of precipitation. In the later location, rains caused flash flooding of arroyos and a mudslide along U.S. Route 180. Additional rainfall caused moderate flooding in Denver. In addition to the rainfall, moisture from the remnants of Lester dropped 2 to 4 inches (50 to 100 mm) of snow across portions of Colorado, causing traffic problems in mountainous areas. A weather station on Mt. Harvard recorded about 4 inches (100 mm) of snow during Lester's passage through Colorado. Moisture enhanced from a cold front, the remnants Lester extended through the eastern United States, with Mattoon, Illinois reporting a peak of . In all, rain from Lester caused rainfall records in Minnesota, Nebraska, Colorado, and North Dakota. ==See also== *Other storms of the same name *List of Baja California Peninsula hurricanes *List of Pacific hurricanes ==References== Lester Lester 1992 Lester 1992 Lester 1992 Lester 1992 Lester 1992 Lester 1992 Category:1992 natural disasters in the United States Lester ","title":"Hurricane Lester (1992)"},{"id":"9071468","text":"State Route 275 (SR 275) is a southwest–northeast state highway entirely within Effingham County in southeast Georgia.

Fourteen unions and sub-unions were invited to compete in the new semi- professional league. The league is deemed semi-professional because some of the smaller clubs are paying foreign players to play for their side. However, the vast majority of the domestic players actually pay to play for their team. The Prairie Fire is by far the most liberal user of foreign professional players.

He was educated in mathematics and atomic physics at University College, London, earning a Ph.D. in theoretical physics in 1951. He was an academic at the Queen's University, Belfast from 1951 to 1967 where he worked with Sir David Bates and rose from assistant lecturer to professor. In the 1950s, he laid the foundations for long-range atomic interaction studies which are of critical importance for today's interest in Bose–Einstein condensates. In 1967 he moved to Harvard to join their department of astronomy and held the positions of acting director of Harvard College Observatory, chairman of the department of astronomy, associate director of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and director of the Institute for Theoretical Atomic and Molecular Physics. Dalgarno's research covered three main areas: theoretical atomic and molecular physics, astrophysics and aeronomy (the study of the upper atmosphere). He made contributions in theoretical chemistry, scattering theory, atmospheric physics & chemistry and astrophysics and was the author of more than 600 publications. Sir David Bates wrote in 1988 that \\"There is no greater figure than Alex in the history of atomic physics and its applications.\\" Known as the \\"father of molecular astrophysics\\", Dalgarno was also a physicist at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory and was formerly the editor of the Astrophysical Journal Letters. Dalgarno was also cited in the Nebula Award winning novel The Quantum Rose by Catherine Asaro, a science- fiction novel based on Asaro's doctoral work while she was a Ph.D student with Dalgarno. He married Barbara Kane, from whom he was later divorced, and had four children. ==Awards== His work was recognized by many awards, including the prize of the International Academy of Quantum Molecular Science, the Davisson-Germer Prize of the American Physical Society (1980), the William F. Meggers Award of the Optical Society of America (1986), the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society (1986) and the Benjamin Franklin Medal in Physics from the Franklin Institute (2013). He was a Fellow of the American Geophysical Union and the American Physical Society and a member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1972 and awarded their prestigious Hughes Medal in 2002. He was also a member of the International Academy of Quantum Molecular Science.

He received his Ph.D. in Anthropology from the University of Florida, in 1977, under the supervision of Charles Wagley, who at that time was considered the foremost Brazilianist in the United States and had done extensive fieldwork in Brazil. His dissertation was about the Tenetehara Indians of northern Brazil and in it Gomes expounded how this Indigenous people had managed to survive almost 400 years of relations with Western society. Years later, Gomes published his first book called Os índios e o Brasil (Petrópolis, Vozes, 1988), where he hailed the survival of Brazilian Indians as the most important news in the recent history of inter-ethnic relations in that country. This book was later translated into English by the University of Florida Presses (2000) with the title The Indians and Brazil. Other books by Gomes are O Índio na História (Petrópolis, Vozes, 2002), Antropologia (São Paulo, Ed. Contexto, 2008), Antropologia Hiperdialética (São Paulo, Ed. Contexto, 2011), and a new, expanded version of Os índios e o Brasil (São Paulo, Ed. Contexto, 2012). ==Career== Since 1975, Gomes has done extensive fieldwork with several Brazilian Indigenous peoples, foremost the Tenetehara, the Guajá, and the Avá-Canoeiro. During his first fieldwork research he helped defend the Tenetehara Indians in a struggle they were having with farmers who claimed to be owners of their land. Beginning in 1980 he did research with the Guajá Indians who had been contacted just 7 years previously. During that year he was responsible for making the first contact with a band of Guajá Indians, who numbered some 30 people at that time. By 2014 this band had joined other bands and numbered some 220 people. In 1991 he was invited together with three other scholars from different parts of the world by several Dutch NGOs to carry out a research on how the Dutch people relate to the environment. The result was a report which was published under the title A Vision for the South: How Wealth Degrades the Environment (Leiden, Van Arkel, 1992). This book is considered the first to be done by non- Europeans on the views of a European society in relation to their environment. Besides teaching in several universities in Brazil and abroad, such as Unicamp, in Campinas, Sao Paulo, UERJ, in Rio de Janeiro, Macalester College, in St. Paul, Minnesota, and Universidade Federal Fluminense (Niterói, RJ), Gomes has also been undersecretary of culture and education in the State of Rio de Janeiro (1991–1995) and president of the Fundação Nacional do Índio (FUNAI - National Foundation for Indigenous Peoples). As head of FUNAI between September 2003 and March 2007, Gomes left a record of organizing and promoting the demarcation of 50 new Indigenous lands, including the Trombetas-Mapuera Indigenous Land, with about 40.000 square km, besides concluding the process of demarcation and registration of some 67 new Indigenous Lands, including the much controversial Raposa Serra do Sol Indigenous Land. Though considered a very difficult job, with critics coming from all sides, such as farmers, agribusiness, politicians, wildcat miners, loggers, and, last but not least, fellow anthropologists and NGOs. One of the most important controversies was in April 2004 when the Cinta-Larga Indians attacked and killed some 29 wildcat miners who were panning for gold on the Indians´ lands. Gomes was subjected to criticism by the Brazilian media for defending the Indians on the basis that they were defending their territory. He averted the imminent possibility of a counter-attack by the more than 3,000 wildcat miners who were removed from the Cinta-Larga territory, and convinced the Brazilian government to refrain from any police action. Gomes was the head of FUNAI for the longest time, up to then, for a civilian and particularly for an anthropologist. == Criticism == Mércio Pereira Gomes' time as head of FUNAI also had some controversial points. Critics wanted him to press on demarcating new Indian lands at a faster rate than had been done up until then. Based on an interview that Gomes gave to a Reuters report, in English, whose translation was published in the Brazilian newspaper O Estado de S. Paulo, in Portuguese, on January 12, 2006, where Gomes had said that the Indians had obtained extensive lands, for a total of 12.5% of the Brazilian territory, his critics misinterpreted it as the Indians had \\"too much land\\", and that caused a big stir among Indian supporters in Brazil and other parts of the world. The Indians response to Gomes´misinterpreted statements that they \\"have too much land\\" can be read on the Survival International page.Survival International: Indigenous policy under fire from Indians as top official visits London ==References== ==External links== *Funai *Gomes' blog *Interview with Gomes, in Portuguese *Sydney Possuelo - Mercio Gomes conflict Category:Brazilian anthropologists Category:Living people Category:University of Florida alumni Category:1950 births ","title":"Mércio Pereira Gomes"},{"id":"9071539","text":"The Exeter and Crediton Railway in context The Exeter and Crediton Railway was a broad gauge railway that linked Exeter and Crediton, Devon, England. It was 5¼ miles (8½ km) long. Although built in 1847, it was not opened until 12 May 1851 due to disagreement about the gauge to be used. It was initially operated by the Bristol and Exeter Railway, but eventually became a part of the London and South Western Railway, thus being one of the few broad gauge railways never to become part of the Great Western Railway. It remains open as part of the scenic Tarka Line from Exeter to . ==HistoryEarly proposals=== Crediton was an important town at the beginning of the nineteenth century, and business interests there considered how transport links could be improved. In 1831 it was proposed to make a railway connection to a dock on the tidal River Exe at Exeter was needed; onward transport would be by coastal shipping. Parliamentary powers were obtained by Act of 23 June 1832. However no construction actually took place and the powers lapsed. The Great Western Railway (GWR) was opened between London and Bristol in 1841, revolutionising transport in the area it served. This encouraged the promotion of another line, the Bristol and Exeter Railway (B&ER;), which was completed on 1 May 1844. This in turn led to the construction of the South Devon Railway (SDR) on from Exeter to Plymouth and Torquay, opened in stages between 30 May 1846 and 2 April 1849. These railways were in a friendly alliance, and were all built on the broad gauge of . Business interests in Crediton were not slow to realise that the railway at Exeter was a benefit for their town if a railway branch could be made to it, and in 1844 a proposal was formulated to make a line from Crediton to Cowley Bridge on the B&ER; the required capital of £60,000 was soon subscribed and an authorising Act was put forward in the 1845 session of Parliament. The railway mania was at its height at this time: proposals for new railways were produced daily, and many of them had little chance of financial success. Parliament established a committee of members of the Board of Trade, headed by Lord Dalhousie, to evaluate competing schemes for any particular district; it was assumed that only one line would satisfy all local requirements. The issue was complicated by the gauge question: the GWR and its allies operated on the broad gauge, while many other companies used the narrow gauge of (later referred to as standard gauge). If a small independent line were authorised, its track gauge implied its allegiance to the GWR and its allies, or to the GWR's competitors, as the case may be.John Nicholas and George Reeve, The Okehampton Line, Irwell Press Ltd, Clophill, 2008, ===The line authorised=== Dalhousie's committee, widely referred to as the Five Kings, considered alternative proposals to link Barnstaple with the emerging national network, via Crediton or otherwise. However, because it became evident that the gauge question was to be determined by a new Gauge Commission, which was expected to mandate the gauge of all future railways, Dalhousie deferred a decision. In the circumstances it is surprising that the Exeter and Crediton Railway (E&CR;) obtained its authorising Act of Parliament on 21 July 1845, with capital of £70,000. The track gauge was to be \\"such as the Board of Trade shall in its discretion approve\\".John Nicholas, The North Devon Line, Oxford Publishing Co., Sparkford, 1992, Christopher Awdry, Encyclopaedia of British Railway Companies, Patrick Stephens Limited, Wellingborough, 1990, 1 85260 049 7E T MacDermot, History of the Great Western Railway volume II, published by the Great Western Railway Company, London, 1931 The new Company made provisional arrangements to lease their line to the B&ER.; ===The Taw Vale line=== Meanwhile, competing proposals were submitted to the 1846 session of Parliament for railways to connect Barnstaple to the network. The B&ER; wished to make a line from their (proposed) Tiverton station, but that was rejected in favour of the Taw Vale Railway Extension and Dock Company, from Barnstaple to join the Exeter and Crediton line at Crediton. This scheme was supported by the London and South Western Railway (LSWR), which aspired to expand into Devon. At this time its nearest approach was east of Salisbury,It had purchased the little Bodmin and Wadebridge Railway in 1845 but had no physical connection to it. but it was determined to get a main line to Exeter and into north Devon. The new Company was usually referred to as the Taw Vale Extension Railway, (TVER), or simply the Taw Vale Railway. The TVER had to be built on the broad gauge, to enable through running on to the Exeter and Crediton line, and the B&ER; lost no time in making a provisional lease of the TVER line to the B&ER;, matching the lease of the Exeter and Crediton line. ===Leasing the Company=== Newton St Cyres railway stationThese provisional leases had to be ratified by shareholders, and at a stormy shareholders' meeting on 11 January 1847 the provisional lease was rejected; the issue of allegiance to the B&ER; and the broad gauge had been taken for granted by the directors, but the shareholders thought otherwise. Many shareholders had only obtained shares in the previous week, and the vote appeared to have been engineered by the LSWR interest.MacDermot volume II page 148 Nonetheless the Company did not propose to work the line itself, and accordingly a lease to the TVER was proposed. The TVER too had had a difficult shareholders' meeting, and had opted to join the LSWR camp. The lease of the E&CR; to the TVER was ratified by E&CR; shareholders on 24 February 1847; the TVER obligations were underwritten by the LSWR and in effect the E&CR; was to be leased to the LSWR. The majority of the directors of the E&CR;, and the chairman J W Buller, were strongly in favour of the B&ER; and were dismayed by this sudden rejection of their intentions. Buller quickly signed a contract to work the line with a George Hennett on 7 April 1847, with the intention of frustrating the alignment to the LSWR bloc. The minority Taw Vale directors called an Extraordinary General Meeting on 12 April 1847, and proposed removal of Buller and three other B&ER; directors, and proposed prohibiting the opening of the line on the broad gauge. Buller as Chairman declared the proposition to be illegal but it was carried. Amid angry scenes and a scuffle, Buller and his friends departed the meeting, taking the minute book with them. At subsequent legal hearings, the takeover by the Taw Vale directors was declared to be legal, and a director called Thorne was properly the chairman of the company. Complaints were made to the Railway Commissioners, and they found that the LSWR had improperly funded share purchases by local individuals to gain a majority at the votes, but the B&ER; had done a similar thing over the E&CR; vote. ===Construction, but not opening=== Notwithstanding the difficulties in shareholders' meetings, construction had been continuing and was ready—as a double track broad gauge line—early in 1847, except for the actual connection to the B&ER; at Cowley Bridge, and the directors anticipated starting train services. However the LSWR supporters among the shareholding obtained an injunction from the Court of Chancery forbidding them from opening on the broad gauge. This was founded on the resolution of 12 April 1847; the significance was that once opened to passengers, a line could not change its gauge without a fresh Act of Parliament. The TVER—effectively the LSWR and in control of the E&CR; infrastructure—applied to the Gauge Commissioners for a decision on the gauge of their own line, and made it clear that they expected that to be for the narrow gauge. Moreover, they altered the track of the E&CR; line to narrow gauge, and informed the Commissioners that they proposed to start narrow gauge passenger services on the E&CR; on 15 February 1848; this was to be from Crediton to Cowley BridgeMacDermot refers to this as \\"in the Cowley Meadows\\", probably a generic location rather than a proposed station name. just short of the B&ER.; The LSWR still aspired to have an independent line from there to their own Queen Street station at Exeter. However, on 8 February 1848 the Commissioners issued their determination: the TVER (and by implication the E&CR;) was to be a broad gauge line. By now the TVER had run out of money, and its sponsor, the LSWR also had heavy financial commitments elsewhere that took precedence. Accordingly, there was now an impasse, and the completed line and the rudimentary station at Cowley Bridge remained unused. It was not until February 1851 that a shareholders' meeting could be informed by William Chaplin, Chairman both of the E&CR; and the LSWR, that a lease to the B&ER; had been agreed; they would work the line, altering one of the two narrow gauge tracks to broad gauge, and installing the junction with their own line at Cowley Bridge; these works would be at the expense of the E&CR.; The Cowley Bridge station would not be required. (In fact the wooden building was dismantled and re-erected at Newton St Cyres.) ===Opening at last=== Captain Mynne of the Board of Trade inspected the line and approved it, and a ceremonial opening took place on 12 May 1851, full public services starting the same day. The E&CR; was now a single broad gauge line (with an unused narrow gauge line alongside), and effectively a branch of the B&ER.; The only stations were Newton St Cyres and Crediton. Road passenger coach services were instituted connecting Barnstaple and Torrington with Crediton. ===The North Devon Railway connects=== The TVER had suffered a reverse over the question of its gauge, and the abandonment by the E&CR; of the narrow gauge exacerbated its feelings. It took some time to decide on a way forward, but by Act of 24 July 1851 it renamed itself the North Devon Railway Company (NDR), reduced its capital and its plans, and settled for a single broad gauge line connecting Barnstaple with Crediton. The Act authorised NDR trains to run over the E&CR; and B&ER; to reach Exeter, by agreement. The NDR opened its line to traffic on 1 August 1854 (although a premature ceremonial \\"opening\\" took place on 12 July). The NDR contracted out its operation to Thomas Brassey, and although through trains operated from Exeter to Barnstaple, engines were changed at Crediton. ===The LSWR reaches Exeter=== After considerable difficulties, the LSWR reached Exeter on 18 July 1860;Ceremonial opening; public opening the following day. their Exeter station, Queen Street, was much more central than the B&ER; station. There was no connection at this stage with the B&ER.; The LSWR had long harboured intentions to extend into north and west Devon, and formerly had thought of an independent line connecting to the E&CR.; However the topography was challenging, and a cooling of the hostility with the B&ER; led to an agreement—concluded on 14 March 1860—to connect the two networks. An Act of 3 July 1860 authorised the construction of a steeply graded connecting line from Queen Street to St Davids at Exeter, mixing the gauge on the B&ER; to Cowley Bridge, and providing mixed gauge track on the E&CR;, and also the NDR line.R A Williams, The London & South Western Railway, volume 2: Growth and Consolidation, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 1973, , pages 223 to 228 ===LSWR acquires the E&CR;=== The necessary track was installed and LSWR trains ran to Crediton from 1 February 1862,MacDermot, page 160 when a lease of the E&CR; line to the LSWR became effective. The lease was renewed for seven years from 1869, and the line was doubled on mixed gauge from 1 June 1875. The LSWR dominated the E&CR; board and shareholding, so independence was illusory, and the line was operated as a part of the LSWR (although a daily broad gauge goods train continued to run). The Bristol and Exeter Railway amalgamated with the Great Western Railway and other companies from 1 February 1876, the combined company using the title Great Western Railway (GWR). Negotiations took place for the LSWR to buy out the GWR shareholding in the E&CR.; Not without difficulty, this was agreed and the purchase was valued at £217,687; as a majority shareholder itself, the LSWR paid out only £81,256. The transfer was effective on 26 June 1879.Williams, volume 2, page 228 ===Part of the LSWR=== The Exeter and Crediton line was now part of the LSWR; it had long been controlled by it, and the neighbouring North Devon Railway had been acquired in 1865, so that the change of ownership simply continued the situation: the Exeter to Barnstaple line was just a branch of the LSWR. Under agreements of 1860 incorporated into Acts of Parliament, the GWR continued to run broad gauge goods trains to Crediton until the abolition of broad gauge on 20 May 1892; narrow gauge GWR goods trains continued operating until 1 October 1903. The Exeter and Crediton section was the stem of the LSWR's continuing expansion in Devon; if the initial traffic in the area was in agricultural and fisheries, the LSWR energetically developed the emerging idea of seaside holidays. Nonetheless the main line to Plymouth was the most important asset. The main line to Plymouth was opened progressively from 1862 to 1876, relying at first on running powers over the South Devon Railway; an independent route by-passing the competing South Devon Railway was opened from Lydford to Devonport 1890. The rocky coast of North Devon was reached in 1874 when the Ilfracombe branch from Barnstaple was opened. Holsworthy was reached in 1879, after which Cornwall was brought into the LSWR network with the opening of the North Cornwall Railway progressively in the period 1886 to 1892, and the line was extended from Holsworthy to Bude in 1898, completing the Okehampton to Bude Line. ==After the LSWR== Under the Railways Act 1921 the main line railways of Great Britain were \\"grouped\\" and the LSWR formed part of the new Southern Railway (SR). The SR had a vigorous publicity organisation and developed the Devon and Cornwall holiday traffic, and the famous Atlantic Coast Express passenger train reached the towns served. From 1948 British Railways was established as the nationalised railway entity in Great Britain. With the rise of independent travel by private car, and the widespread transfer of goods transport to road, followed by the rise of cheap holidays overseas, usage of the lines collapsed and closures of many of the North Devon and North Cornwall lines followed. The Exeter and Crediton line remains open as the stem of what is now the Barnstaple branch line; the passenger service operates under the brand name the Tarka Line. ==Stations== * ; Bristol and Exeter Railway station, a little over a mile south of the E&CR; junction; used by E&CR; trains; * Cowley Bridge; constructed in 1848 but never opened; * St Cyres; renamed 1 October 1913; * . ==Infrastructure== The line climbed gently, typically at 1 in 303, from Cowley Bridge Junction to Crediton. The line was completed, but not opened, from Cowley Bridge Junction (with the Bristol and Exeter Railway) to Crediton in 1847. It was a broad gauge double track, and a station at Cowley Bridge was built and complete in 1848; it too was not opened. There was a double track wooden viaduct on the curve away from the B&ER; line, crossing the River Exe. The Exeter and Crediton line was opened as a single broad gauge line on 12 May 1851. The TVER line from Crediton on to Barnstaple opened as single line on the broad gauge on 1 August 1854. The Exe viaduct at Cowley Bridge was replaced by a double track iron bridge in 1858, but as part of the work the curve to the junction was tightened considerably. Mixed gauge track was commissioned on the E&CR; line on 1 February 1862. A short section of double track at Cowley Bridge, called Cowley loop, was opened 11 November 1874, and the line from the loop to St Cyres was doubled on 23 February 1875, and St Cyres to Crediton was doubled form 2 June 1875. Broad gauge was abolished 20 May 1892. The line over Cowley Viaduct was singled on 28 November 1965, and the entire line was singled 16 December 1984. ==Notes== ==See also== * Southern Railway routes west of Salisbury ==References== ==Further reading== David St John Thomas, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain – Volume I – the West Country, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 1966 Category:Rail transport in Devon Category:7 ft gauge railways Category:London and South Western Railway Category:Transport in Exeter Category:Railway companies established in 1845 Category:Railway lines opened in 1851 Category:Railway companies disestablished in 1862 Category:1845 establishments in England ","title":"Exeter and Crediton Railway"},{"id":"9071559","text":"Lance William Key (born 13 May 1968) is an English former footballer, who played as a goalkeeper.

He collaborated with Toneelgroep Amsterdam, Holland Festival, Nederlands Philharmonisch Orkest, the Dutch National Ballet and Springdance festival, among many others. With his non profit organization La Vie Sur Terre he frequently produces large scale projects on location with local artists and musicians, for example in Cyprus, Japan, Jordan, the Palestinian Territories, Syria, and Central Europe.

He was a speaker about the role of arts in conflict areas at Aspen Institute Washington and Aspen Ideas Festival in Aspen, CO. In 2014 and 2015, Merlijn Twaalfhoven created \\"Bridging The Divide\\", a conversation with Tomáš Sedláček and Gloria Benedikt, linking economics and the irrational, positioning artists as agents of change. He was co-founder of Citizen Artist Incubator together with Gloria Benedikt, which was funded by Creative Europe and brought together 30 artists in two editions. The 2016 of Citizen Artist Incubator took place at IIASA. Twaalfhoven was a speaker about the role of arts in conflict areas at Aspen Institute Washington, TEDx Amsterdam, the European Forum on Culture 2013,http://ec.europa.eu/assets/eac/culture/events/2013/documents/forum-2013-programme_en.pdf 2016 and Aspen Ideas Festival in Aspen, Colorado, U.S.A. In 2017 he founded the Turn Club. ==Artistic vision== For Twaalfhoven, musical expression revolves around communication: 'A work of art doesn't mean anything if the audience is not touched by it' He tends to take music out of its traditional surroundings, to mix it with other expressions of Western or non-Western culture. He also tends to get the musicians out of their usual behaviour patterns and so stimulate interactions with the audience. His projects often take place at alternative concert locations such as a shipyard in the Amsterdam harbor, an old warehouse, or a nature spot. Politics are part of a majority of his work. This can be seen by the areas of social tension he brings his works to (for example Cyprus or the Palestinian Territories). He often speaks and writes about his outspoken vision on art and its function in society. A few illustrations are: his speech during TEDx Amsterdam conference in 2009, his professorship at ArtEZ School of Arts (see Research), as well as his published articles and book (see Publications). ==City Composer== Twaalfhoven was the first 'citycomposer' in the Netherlands. He performed this task for the municipality of Zaanstad where he was appointed for one year on September 25, 2006. Local musicians, professionals, actors, visual artists and volunteers played leading roles at all performances. The post of citycomposer is not unique to the Netherlands. For instance Ghent in Belgium had a citycomposer appointed for the first time in 2004. Twaalfhoven's work in Zaanstad culminated in a large main event: 'Droomzomernacht', an adaptation of Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream, performed with over 150 local musicians, dancers and actors In October 2010 he has been appointed for the task of citycomposer again, this time in the municipality of Haarlemmermeer. ==Selected Projects== * The Music on Troubled Soils Conference (Jerusalem, 2008).

It is made in the United States by its inventor Bill Wesley and manufactured by Wesley with Patrick Hadley in San Diego, California, United States. Its development began in the 1960s. It is a radical redesign of the African mbira and is part of the lamellaphone family. The metal tines are grouped into multiple octaves. Sounding each grouping of octaves in a left-to-right direction runs through the circle of fifths, and sounding each group in a right-to-left direction runs through the circle of fourths (unlike a piano which runs through the chromatic scale). Usually, the Array mbira contains two and a half repetitions of the entire chromatic scale, arranged in a continuous circle of fifths. The octaves of each note (A220, A440, and A880, for example) are grouped together in a staggered, nearly vertical arrangement. Each of the metal tines in a group may be played independently, and multiple octaves may be sounded together in a one-fingered stroke. The octave groups may contain as few as two octaves (two tines), or as many as five. There are 12×2.5=30 octave groups in the standard design, so a five-octave Array mbira uses 5×30=150 tines. The arrangement of the tines allows music to be played with relative ease in any key. ==Description== Generally, the Array mbira is large enough to allow two people to play on the same instrument at once, side by side. It is a sturdy instrument, requiring only occasional care. Sounds are made by manually pushing down gently and releasing bent metal tines with a grasping fist movement of the fingers. Some contact with the finger nail helps to produce a crisp and clear tone. Low notes are played upwards with the pad of the thumb. The tines are made from high-carbon spring steel. They are individually hand-cut and ground to a smooth round shape on the ends. These tines are held down to the sounding board by two bolted crossbars. These crossbars keep the notes in tune over long periods, often many years. The names of the notes are engraved into the metal crossbar. The lower notes are closer to the player, and the higher notes are farther away. The tines are arranged so that the most consonant intervals (octaves, fifths, and fourths) vibrate along with the fundamental. Furthermore, each tine is bent at a certain angle to produce harmonics (most notably the 6th harmonic, or two octaves plus a fifth) that are more consonant than other mbiras and kalimbas. Two types of Array mbiras are available, a hollow body and a solid body. Both models have dual piezoelectric pickups that produce two separate channels, one for the left side of the instrument and one for the right side. The hollow body is an acoustic instrument that utilizes a sound box, which can be made from a variety of domestic and exotic hardwoods. Because these instruments are hand crafted works of art, there are many options for embellishment, including various inlaid borders, burl veneers, colored lacquer and type of finish. The solid body instruments are heavier than the hollow bodies but smaller in overall size. They are better for live performances because they do not have problems with audio feedback when amplified. ==Arrangement == The notes (of which there may be up to 150, comprising up to five octavesHey, what's that sound: Thumb piano. The Guardian. 2010-11-01.) are arranged according to the Array system, developed by musicologist, performer, and author Bill Wesley.Collings, Ryan. The Mbira, p.4. The Array system of organizing the notes is similar to the Wicki-Hayden note layout, while offering the advantage of being able to play multiple octaves of the same note with one finger. The Array system is a specific pattern of arranging musical tones. It is both isomorphic and unimorphic (meaning that harmonious notes are grouped adjacently, excluding dissonant notes). There is only one unimorphic planar (as opposed to linear) system available on a lead instrument at this time, and that is the system used for organizing the Array mbira. Because the Array system is isomorphic, any given chord, scale, or song, no matter how complex, can be played in any one of the 12 keys immediately after the player learns to play it in one key. Because it is unimorphic, common chords tend to fall close together. In the key of C, for example, the F and G major chords can be played by moving the C major chord shape one octave group to the left or right. The same applies to Em, Am, and Dm. The minor chord shape is easier to play with the left hand, while major chords are easier to play with the right hand. There is a row for every possible musical interval, not just fifths, fourths, and octaves but also whole tones, minor thirds, etc. The Array system can be thought of not only as being based on the circle of fifths, but as being based on rows of whole tones. Each whole-tone row is separated by a fifth/fourth. ==Technique== The experience of playing an Array mbira is that less shifting around of movement is required for playing a given chord progression. Because of the duplications of all notes available (two to three times for every octave of every note), complex rhythms and fast melodies are easier to play. The Array system allows the player to access the same notes with each hand in different locations. In addition to this, the close grouping of octaves allows large chords to be played that would require four hands on a piano. An mbira with only two or three octaves is better suited to fast, complex melodies while the larger five octave model is better suited to large chords and complex voicings. The shorter tines sound higher in pitch. This means that any ascending scale travels away from the player toward the back of the instrument. An ascending major scale is played by playing a \\"three-four\\" pattern: do-re-mi, fa-sol-la- ti, do-re-mi, etc., going higher and higher until you run out of notes. The visual/tactile sensation of playing a group of three notes followed by a group of four notes results from the nature of the major scale: two whole steps, followed by a half step, followed by three more whole steps, and ending with one more half step to get back to \\"do\\". The minor scale and the five other musical modes work much the same way, as does the major pentatonic scale and its \\"modes\\". One possible playing position places both hands over the notes F, C, G, D, A, E, and B, the notes of the C major and A minor scales as well as many other scales and modes. Accidentals (F#, C#, G#, D#, A#) fall immediately between and outside of the hands. This position emphasizes consonant intervals. Moving the hands further apart or closer together yields positions that emphasize dissonant intervals. ==Cultural influence== The Array mbira is played by a number of notable musicians, including Sting,#LifeIsMusic: Here are 5 modern musical instruments you’ve never heard of before.DNA India. 2015-07-11.

The station operates on the FM radio frequency of 93.5 MHz, FM channel 228. . The studios are located at 3575 McCarty Lane in Lafayette, Indiana. ==History== WKHY was originally WXUS, a radio station located at 92.7 MHz on the FM dial. The station originally carried religious/inspirational programming until the station was sold to a secular broadcaster. The format then became Adult contemporary as \\"US 93\\". In addition to the AC format, the station also carried some religious programming during the late night/early morning hours to fulfill their license requirements (this continued until the station moved frequencies). In the mid-1980s, the AC format was dropped in favor of album-oriented rock. The station continued to call themselves \\"US 93\\". In the late 1980s, the station moved to 93.5 MHz as a result of a frequency reassignment which affected many stations in the 92-94 MHz band throughout North-central Indiana and East-central Illinois. Shortly after the switch, despite high ratings, the station flipped its format to Classic hits due to a lack of advertising. A contest was then launched to pick the new callsign for the station. The winner chose WKHY, meaning \\"We play the Klassic Hits just for You!\\", which remain on 93.5 to this day. Classic hits remained on the station through the early 1990s when the station segued to Classic rock. WKHY would also tweak its on-air branding to \\"93-5 KHY\\". In 1996, Artistic Media Partners' fledgling country music outlet, WGBD, switched to a modern rock format giving WKHY a direct competitor. Both stations fared well with KHY winning mainly the upper end of their target demo and WGBD winning the younger end, according to Arbitron. In 2001, WGBD flipped to classic rock and now competes with WKHY for the older male demographic. KHY maintained their AOR format and, to this day, continue to be a ratings winner for males 18–49. Due to the recent format change of WSHP, WKHY now airs Bob and Tom in the Lafayette area.

The village of Saint-Thibéry is built at the confluence of the Rivers Thongue and Hérault. The old Roman road \\"Via Domitia\\" runs through the village (Grand Rue) and some of the houses date back to the 15th century. Saint-Thibéry is situated between the larger towns of Agde and Pézenas and the cities Béziers and Montpellier and is a short distance to Mediterranean Sea. Over 4000 years old, this former Celtic village was once called \\"Cessero\\". ==Saint-Thibéry Abbey and Church== The Benedictine Abbey (l’abbaye bénédictine) and Church sit in the heart of the village. It was founded in the late 8th century by Atilio, a disciple of Benedict Aniane, near the tomb of three local martyrs. The Abbey Church has an unusual underground altar. During the 15th century, the church was rebuilt on its original Romanesque bases, in a Gothic style. The bell-tower was erected in 1509 and had eight bells. In the past the Church attracted many pilgrims who believed that relics kept there had special healing powers. Saint-Thibéry is also on one of the old Santiago de Compostela Pilgrimage routes. ==Saint- Thibéry mill== This corn (wheat) mill (moulin à bled) was built in the 13th century and is one of the best preserved mills in the region. It has four wheels powered by water from the Hérault. A Romanesque tower was used to store the grain. The mill once belonged to the Benedictine abbots and is situated beside the so-called Roman bridge. ==Volcano== Mount Ramus, an extinct volcano, offers some magnificent views of the Languedoc, the Pyrenees mountains and the Mediterranean Sea with Spain off in the distance. In the village of Saint-Thibéry there are some interesting volcanic features such as the basalt “organ” columns. There is an ancient fort on the volcano, dating from the 5th century BC. It overlooks the village and the Hérault valley. ==Saint-Thibéry rivers== Saint-Thibéry is situated where the River Thongue joins the Hérault. (The Hérault department is named after the latter.) The Thongue is the smaller river and flows down from the Languedoc mountains. The Hérault is 148 kilometres (92 mi) and flows from the Cévennes mountains.

He had been an advertising executive, book publisher and, for the past two decades, a consultant and free-lance journalist for many leading business information technology magazines. He lived on Long Island, New York with his wife, three sons, three grandchildren and a mountain of books and literary papers. As publishing executive, he came to know and publish many books by Arkham House founder August Derleth between 1962–1971, some under his Candlelight Press imprint, and researched his former colleague's life and time for nearly forty years. Ruber became the editor for Arkham House in 1997, after Jim Turner left to found Golden Gryphon Press. Ruber drew criticism for the hostile opinions of various authors he expressed in his story introductions within his anthology Arkham's Masters of Horror (2000). Rumours of his ill-health circulated for some time; he suffered a stroke in 2004 and his editorial duties at Arkham House lapsed due to this. Ruber authored The Last Bookman: A Journey into the Life and Times of Vincent Starrett: Journalist, Bookman, Bibliophile (NY: Candlelight Press, 1968; reprint Battered Silicon Dispatch Box, 1995) and editor of over 25 books. He did much research for a biography on August Derleth (as yet unpublished) and Seabury Quinn. He also began editing for Battered Silicon Dispatch Box all of Vincent Starrett's works, with 22 of a projected 25 volumes already in print. In 2000 Ruber edited a collection of previously unpublished stories by H. Russell Wakefield for Ash-Tree Press. For the same publisher in 2003 he edited Night Creatures by Seabury Quinn. Ruber suffered a stroke in 2004 and his editorial duties at Arkham House lapsed due to this. Ruber died on March 6, 2014. ==References== * * Category:1941 births Category:2014 deaths Category:American book editors Category:American book publishers (people) Category:Male speculative fiction editors ","title":"Peter Ruber"},{"id":"9071941","text":"The Tenma goddesses are twelve guardian deities in Tibetan Buddhism.

The TV shows feature various \\"damsel in distress\\" scenarios, whereby Sam abducts Sue and places her in peril, intending to force her to give him the deed to her ranch or face a gruesome death: *In the first verse, the narrator watches Sam attempt to kill Sue by cutting her in half in an abandoned sawmill. *In the second verse, the narrator fixes a snack during a commercial break, and comes back to see Sam attempting to detonate Sue in an abandoned mine. *In the third verse, apparently tired of the show, the narrator changes channels, only to find a different episode of the show, this time with Sam attempting to stuff Sue in a burlap sack and throw her in front of an oncoming train. However, Sue is rescued, and Sam's plans foiled, by the hero, a \\"tall, thin\\", \\"slow- walkin'\\", \\"slow-talkin'\\", \\"long, lean, lanky\\" fellow named Jones. How Jones defeats Sam and rescues Sue is never told. The tenor saxophone heard on this record by The Coasters is King Curtis, who played sax on many of their hits. ==Origins and meaning== Westerns were the most popular genre on TV and film in the 1950s and early 1960s. In mocking their inescapable presence, the song takes inspiration from the 1945 Gary Cooper film Along Came Jones, a comedy Western. In the film the \\"long, lean, lanky\\" Cooper lampoons his usual \\"slow- walkin', slow-talkin'\\" screen persona. The music for the film was composed by Arthur Lange, mentor to songwriter Mike Stoller. Historian Ken Emerson notes of the song: \\"What was original in the humor of 'Along Came Jones' was not its parody of shoot-'em-ups … What was new were black voices mocking an iconic Caucasian genre fifteen years before Mel Brooks' Blazing Saddles. Leiber's original lyrics sharpened the racial angle by calling attention to the hero's white hat, white boots, and faithful white horse. Those lines did not pass muster with Jerry Wexler, the executive producer at Atlantic to whom Leiber and Stoller generally reported.\\" ==Cover versions== The Righteous Brothers covered the song on their Sayin' Something album (1967).The Righteous Brothers, Sayin' Something Retrieved February 7, 2012 In their version, by the third verse Bill Medley, who says the repeated line \\"And then ...\\", has lost patience with the story as told by Bobby Hatfield. A cover version by novelty pop artist Ray Stevens in 1969, reached a peak of #27 on the Billboard Hot 100.Ray Stevens chart positions Retrieved February 7, 2012. Stevens was also the voice of \\"Salty Sam,\\" and (in falsetto) of \\"Sweet Sue,\\" who screams for help and makes humorous ad-libs (e.g. \\"there he go again, tyin' me up, same routine\\" and \\"here comes the train, here comes the train\\"). The track features dubbed-in laughter and cheering from a \\"live\\" audience, and includes a brief quote from Rossini's \\"William Tell Overture\\" at the end. Micky Dolenz and Davy Jones (of Monkees fame) did a cover version with Monkees songwriters Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart, on the album Dolenz, Jones, Boyce & Hart in 1976.Dolenz, Jones, Boyce & Hart, Dolenz, Jones, Boyce & Hart Retrieved February 7, 2012 Jones makes humorous comments in a mock-posh British accent (\\"That's not cricket, old chap\\"). \\"Yakety Sax\\" is interpolated during the saxophone solo. The French singer Henri Salvador covered the song in French, but with different lyrics and a children's television hero in the starring role: \\"Zorro est arrivé\\" (1964).Henri Salvador - Zorro est Arrivé - EMI Records (France) The song is alluded to in the song \\"Million Dollar Bash\\" by Bob Dylan. The song was covered in 1980 in a country duet by George Jones and Johnny Paycheck on their album Double Trouble.

It was built in 1562–1564 by Giorgio Vasari for the headquarters of the Knights of St. Stephen, as a renovation of the already existing Palazzo degli Anziani (\\"Palace of the Elders\\"). The name, meaning \\"Palace of the Convoy\\", derives from the three-year period undertaken by the initiates of the Order for their training, called \\"la Carovana\\". The façade is characterized by a complex scheme with sgraffiti representing allegorical figures and zodiacal signs, designed by Vasari himself and sculpted by Tommaso di Battista del Verrocchio and Alessandro Forzori, coupled to busts and marble crests. The current paintings date however to the 19th-20th centuries. Amongst the sculptures are the Medici Coat of Arms and that of the Knights, flanked by the allegories of Religion and Justice by Stoldo Lorenzi (1563). The upper gallery of busts of the Grand Dukes of Tuscany (who were all also the Grand Masters of the Order) were added in the late 16th-early 18th centuries, sculpted by Ridolfo Sirigatti, Pietro Tacca and Giovan Battista Foggini. The double-ramp staircase was remade in 1821. The rear area is a modern addition (1928–1930) for the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa.

Kasavana, Ph.D. and Donald J. Smith at the Michigan State University School of Hospitality Business in 1982. It is also commonly referred to as menu psychology. == Definition == In general, the term menu engineering is used within the hospitality industry (specifically in the context of restaurants), but can be applied to any industry that displays a list of product or service offerings for consumer choice. Typically the goal with menu engineering is to maximize a firm's profitability by subconsciously encouraging customers to buy what you want them to buy, and discouraging purchase of items you don't want them to buy. Fields of study which contribute most to menu engineering include: * Psychology (perception, attention, emotion/effect) * Managerial accounting (contribution margin and unit cost analysis) * Marketing and strategy (pricing, promotion) * Graphic design (layout, typography) == Psychology of menu engineering == Perception and attention—Visual perception is inextricably linked to how customers read a menu. Most menus are presented visually (though many restaurants verbally list daily specials), and the majority of menu engineering recommendations focus on how to increase attention by strategically arranging menu categories within the pages of the menu, and item placement within a menu category. This strategic placement of categories and items is referred to as the theory of sweet spots.Though the original reference of 'sweet spot' has not been found, it has been traced to repeated references in academic work and trade press. See Kelson, A. H. (1994) \\"The ten commandments for menu success\\". Restaurant Hospitality, 78(7), 103. Kotschevar, L. H. (208). In Withrow D. (ed.), Management by Menu (4th ed.), Hoboken, N..: John Wiley. Miller, J. E., 1930–. (1992). Menu Pricing & Strategy. (3rd Ed.). New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold.'' The reasoning being sweet spots stem from the classical effect in psychology known as the serial position effect (also known as the rules of recency and primacy). The thought is, customers are most likely to remember the first and last things they see on a menu—hence, sweet spots on a menu should be where the customers look first and last. To date, there is no empirical evidence on the efficacy of the sweet spots on menus.Gallup Report (1987). Through the Eyes of the Customer. The Gallup Monthly Report on Eating Out, 7(3), 1–9. Reynolds, D., Merritt, E. A., and Pinckney, S. (2005). \\"Understanding Menu Psychology: An Empirical Investigation of Menu Design and Consumer Response.\\" International Journal of Hospitality & Tourism Administration, 6(1), 1–10. Kincaid, Clark S., Corsun, David L. (2003). \\"Are Consultants blowing Smoke? An Empirical Test of the Impact of Menu Layout on Item Sales\\". International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management, 12 (4/5), 226–231. Customer perception of items offered on a menu can also be affected by subtle textual manipulations. For example, descriptive labeling of item names may produce positive effects, leading to higher customer satisfaction, and higher perceived product value.Wansink, B., Painter, J., and Van Ittersum, K. (2001). \\"Descriptive menu labels' effect on sales\\". Cornell Hotel & Restaurant Administration Quarterly, 42(6), 68. Similarly, the presence of dollar signs or other potential monetary cues may cause guests to spend less.Yang, S., Kimes, S. E., and Sessarego, M. M. (2009), \\"$ or Dollars?: Effects of Menu Price Formats on Customer Price Purchases\\", Cornell Hospitality Report. 9 (8) == Managerial accounting == The primary goal of menu engineering is to encourage purchase of targeted items, presumably the most profitable items, and to discourage purchase of the least profitable items. To that end, firms must first calculate the cost of each item listed on the menu. This costing exercise should extend to all items listed on the menu, and should reflect all costs incurred to produce and serve. Optimally item costs should include: food cost (including wasted product and product loss), incremental labor (e.g., cost in in-house butchering, pastry production, or prep), condiments and packaging. Only incremental costs and efforts should be included in the item cost. The two criteria for determining which menu items should be featured on a menu have been food cost percentage and gross profit. Food cost percentage is calculated by dividing the cost of the menu item ingredients, including surrounding dish items, e.g., salad, bread and butter, condiments, etc. by the menu price. Gross profit is calculated by subtracting the menu cost as previously defined, from the menu price. Advocates of menu engineering believe that gross profit trumps food cost so they tend to identify menu items with the highest gross profit, items like steaks and seafood, as the items to promote. The downside of this exclusive approach is that items that are high in gross profit are typically the highest priced items on the menu and they typically are on the high end of the food cost percentage scale. This approach works fine in price inelastic markets like country clubs and fine dining white table cloth restaurants. However, in highly competitive markets, which most restaurants reside, think Applebee's, Chili's, Olive Garden, price points are particularly critical in building customer counts. In addition, food cost cannot be ignored completely. If food cost increases, total costs must increase enough to lower the overall fixed cost percentage or the bottom line will not improve. This is not a recommended strategy for neighborhood restaurant with average checks under $15. Those who believe that a low food cost percentage is more important than gross profit will promote the items with the lowest food cost percentage. Unfortunately, these items are typically the lowest priced items on the menu, e.g., chicken, pasta, soups. Promoting only low food cost items will likely result in lowering your average check and unless the restaurant attracts more customers, overall sales will not be optimized. Low food cost and high gross profit are not mutually exclusive attributes of a menu item. A second approach called cost-margin analysis identifies items that are both low in food cost and return a higher than average gross profit. These items referred to as primes.The Fundamental Principles of Restaurant Cost Controls, David Pavesic and Paul Magnant, 2nd Ed, Pearson-Prentice Hall, 2005, This analysis works well for restaurants in highly competitive markets where customers are price-sensitive. There is really no single method of analysis that can be used across the board on all menu items. If a menu item is a \\"commodity\\" like hamburgers, chicken tenders, fajitas, and other items found on the majority of restaurant menus, prices tend to be more moderate. If a menu item is a \\"specialty\\" and unique to a particular restaurant, and demand is high, prices can be higher than average because technically the restaurant has a \\"monopoly\\" on that item and until competitors copy them and put it on their menus, higher prices can be charged. However, no restaurant can sustain a competitive uniqueness or price advantage over their competition in the long run. Eventually competitors will try to match them. Using menu engineering in restaurants or menu items where price inelasticity is present is recommended and cost-margin in casual neighborhood restaurants and on menu items where price points are critical in building and keeping customers should be considered. Remember, the customer determines the best price to charge, not the restaurant operator. Customers do not care about your costs; they care about what you charge. After an item's cost and price have been determined, analysis and evaluation of an item's profitability is based on the item's contribution margin. The contribution margin is calculated as the menu price minus the cost. Menu engineering then focuses on maximizing the contribution margin of each guest's order. Recipe costing should be updated (at least the ingredient cost portion) whenever the menu is reprinted or whenever items are re-engineered. Some simplified calculations of contribution margin include only food costs. == References == ==External links== * Category:Restaurant menus Category:Product management ","title":"Menu engineering"},{"id":"9072303","text":"Breeding place of the Black-thighed falconet in Ipoh Black-thighed falconet on Breeding place The black-thighed falconet (Microhierax fringillarius) is one of the smallest birds of prey, typically measuring between long, with a wingspan, which is a size comparable to a typical sparrow.Raptors of the World by Ferguson-Lees, Christie, Franklin, Mead & Burton. Houghton Mifflin (2001)828-829, It is native to Brunei Darussalam, Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia. and vagrant to Sri Lanka. ==Taxonomy and systematics== Thomas Horsfield described to the Linnean Society of London in 1820 a Javan variety of Falco cærulescens (the collared falconet). He noted that \\"the Javan specimens are somewhat smaller, and differently marked\\" than the Bengal specimen which had been described by John Edwards in 1750. A fuller description was published in his 1824 book, Zoological Researches in Java. Also in 1824, Drapiez published the name Falco fringillarius, and Vigors proposed the genus Ierax or Hierax. ==Description== This is a minute, shrike- like falcon, with a squarish tail that is frequently spread. The adult male is glossy black above, with a white forehead streak that arcs around black cheeks. It has a white or rufous-washed throat, with a white breast shading into a rufous abdomen. Its thighs and flanks are black, as is its cere and legs. In flight the male has white wings underneath with black barring on the primaries and secondary flight feathers, and light streaking on the underwing coverts. There are three white bars underneath on the otherwise plain black tail. The adult female is similar to the adult male, except the tail is longer. The juvenile is similar to the adults, except that the white areas of the head are rufous. The voice is a hard, high-pitched cry shiew and a fast repeated kli-kli-kli-kli. ==Habitat== The typical habitat is forest, forest edge and wooded open area. It can also frequently be found around human cultivation, villages, and near active slash-and-burn forest clearance; often by rivers, streams, and paddy fields. It mostly lives below 1,500m elevation. ==Food== This falconet mainly feeds on insects, including moths, butterflies, dragonflies, alate termites and cicadas, occasional small birds, and lizards. Feeding behavior appears to often be social, with feeding parties up to ten recorded. Much of the prey is taken during quick flights from a perch. ==Sociosexual Behavior and Breeding== This falconet is generally social and gregarious, often found in loose pairs or groups of ten or more. The breeding season for this falcon varies by location, with populations up to the North of the equator breeding mostly in February–June. To the South of the equator, egg-laying is recorded in Java in November–December. This falconet usually uses old nest holes of barbets, or occasionally old woodpecker holes. No material is added in the cavity aside from insect remains. The typical clutch size is between 2-5 eggs. Incubation and fledging periods are unknown. The nest hole may be used as a roost by adults year-round. ==Population== There is no data on population densities, but like many tiny falconets, the total numbers are probably under-recorded. The overall range extends more than 1.5 million km2. Population assessments vary from common (in Sumatra and Borneo), to fairly common (in Thailand), to scarce (in Java and Bali).

Oil on canvas, Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica, 1615 Orazio Borgianni (6 April 1574 – 14 January 1616)The year of his death was established by Roberto Longhi, \\"Orazio Borgianni\\", L'Arte 17 (1914:10); the notice of his sepulture in San Lorenzo in Lucina was noted by Harold E. Wethey, \\"Orazio Borgianni in Italy and in Spain\\" The Burlington Magazine 106 No. 733 (April 1964:146-159) p147, note 3. was an Italian painter and etcher of the Mannerist and early-Baroque periods. He was the stepbrother of the sculptor and architect Giulio Lasso. Borgianni was born in Rome, where he was documented in February 1604. He was instructed in the art of painting by his brother, Giulio Borgiani, called Scalzo. The patronage by Philip II of Spain induced him to visit that Spain, where he signed an inventory in January 1605. He returned to Rome from Spain after April 1605 at the height of his career, and most of the work of his maturity was carried out 1605–16.Wethey 1964:146-159, suggests that the longer trip to Spain and his marriage there noted by his biographer Giovanni Baglione, should be assigned to the years ca. 1598–1602. In Spain, he signed a petition to begin an Italianate academy of painting and executed a series of nine paintings for the Convento de Portacoeli, Valladolid, where they remain. From his time in Spain, there remain two of his paintings in the Prado Museum: St Christopher and the Stigmatization of St Francis and also an attributed selfportrait of youth. Not far from the Prado in Madrid, the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando owns a David and Goliath. On his return to Rome he was patronized by the Spanish ambassador, for whom he painted several pictures, and he was also employed in painting for the churches. He painted as late as 1630, after which he returned to Spain. He frescoed in the apse of the church of San Silvestro in Capite in Rome, a Martyrdom of S.Stefano I and a Messengers of Constantine call on Saint Silvestro (1610). His canvas of San Carlo Borromeo in the church of San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane (1612) is an eclectic and emotive synthesis of both Carracci and tenebrist styles. The influence of Caravaggio is also evident in a painting of the same saint (1616) now in the Hermitage Museum. A lively self-portrait of an earnest, somewhat foppish Borgianni is in the Rome Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica. His early biographer was his contemporary, Giovanni Baglione,Baglione, Le vite dei pittori (Rome, 1642:140-43. who leans heavily on anecdote. He is said to have had a temper; riding one day in a coach, at Rome, he saw some artists, among whom was Caravaggio, laughing at him; he sprang from the carriage, seized a bottle of varnish from the shop of a druggist, and threw it at the heads of the offenders.Clara Erskine Clement, Painters, Sculptors, Architects, Engravers, and their Works, 9th edition, Boston: Houghton and Co., 1892, p. 193.

His father, Michał Ostrowski, had earlier fought in the pro-Polish January Uprising of 1863 for which he was sent to the Russian katorga in Siberia. Stanisław Ostrowski studied medicine at Lwow University. During the Polish-Ukrainian War (battle of Lwów (1918)) and the Polish-Bolshevik War (1919–1920) Ostrowski participated as a physician with the Polish Army. Following these conflicts he became Vice Mayor, and later Mayor, of Lwow. He was also a three-term member of the Sejm from the BBWR Bloc. As a legislator he focused on health affairs as well as developing a reputation of being a defender of minorities' rights. After the Soviet invasion of Poland (1939), he was arrested and imprisoned in Moscow (until 1941). Among his fellow prisoners was Anandyn Amar, former Prime Minister and President of Mongolia. He was released from Soviet captivity on amnesty following the Sikorski–Mayski agreement as an officer of the Polish Army in the East by efforts of (commander-in-chief general Władysław Anders) in 1942. In 1944–1945 he participated in the anti-Nazi Germany Italian campaign as a physician of military hospitals. When World War II ended, he moved to England and became involved in the politics of the Polish community there, which included the Polish government in exile. Ostrowski was the third president of Poland in exile (1972–1979). He took office after death of President August Zaleski. To begin with he had to deal with a deep crisis within the emigre circles. Zaleski, despite earlier promises, declined to step down after seven years in office (1954), which caused formation of the Council of Three, an opposition body, recognized by a part of the emigrees as a collective head of state. Ostrowski's selection was recognized by the council, which then dissolved itself. Because of that Ostrowski is credited for uniting Polish emigree circles. He also strongly refused to acknowledge annexation of the eastern areas of the Second Polish Republic by the USSR after World War II. As promised, President Ostrowski stepped down after a seven-years term in favor of Edward Bernard Raczyński. Ostrowski died in London and is buried in a Polish military cemetery in Newark, along with other past Presidents in exile. In 1987 a plaque dedicated to Ostrowski was unveiled in the St. Stanislaus Kostka Church, Warsaw. Ostrowski died without children. ==References== * Biography from an official Presidential website * The last President of Lviv * Ostrowski memories Category:1892 births Category:1982 deaths Category:People from the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria Category:Nonpartisan Bloc for Cooperation with the Government politicians Category:Camp of National Unity politicians Category:Members of the Sejm of the Second Polish Republic (1930–1935) Category:Members of the Sejm of the Second Polish Republic (1935–1938) Category:Members of the Sejm of the Second Polish Republic (1938–1939) Category:Mayors of Lviv Category:Polish anti-communists Category:Polish physicians Category:Polish people of the Polish–Ukrainian War Category:Polish people of the Polish–Soviet War Category:Polish deportees to Soviet Union Category:Foreign Gulag detainees Category:20th-century physicians ","title":"Stanisław Ostrowski"},{"id":"9072370","text":"Muscle is an American sitcom television series that aired on The WB from January 11 to May 24, 1995. It was set inside the fictional Survival Gym in New York City, and was a parody of prime time soap operas of the 1990s (with Fox's Melrose Place being the most noticeable inspiration). The series was created by Rob LaZebnik, and was executive produced by Paul Junger Witt, Tony Thomas and Gary S. Levine. Muscle was one of the four sitcoms that aired as part of the original Wednesday night two-hour WB lineup, at 9:30/8:30c (with The Wayans Bros., The Parent 'Hood, and Unhappily Ever After being scheduled before it). It was the only one of the four that did not make it past the first season, and was also the first series to get canceled on the brand new WB. Like its inspiration, ABC's Soap from the 1970s, it ended on an unresolved cliffhanger after being canceled due to low ratings. == Synopsis == The central plot concerned the murder of \\"Big\\" Jim Atkinson (Adam West), the president and founder of the chain of gyms, by poisoning in the first episode. His son Kent, a former alcoholic and drug addict, was determined to figure out who the killer was and bring him or her to justice. His original suspect was his stepmother and the new president of the company, Jane Atkinson. == Cast  Main === * Dan Gauthier as Kent Atkinson, was the son of the founder of Survivor Gyms, Jim Atkinson. The two of them had a contentious relationship fueled by the fact that Kent never felt that his father thought he was good enough. This may have contributed to his various acts of rebellion against his father, such as his alcoholism, drug abuse and frequent womanizing. :In an ultimate act of rebellion he would sleep with his father's trophy wife, Jane, inside the gym's sauna. When Big Jim caught them in the act he apparently died of a heart attack, but an autopsy would reveal that he was in fact poisoned. Kent would then spend the rest of the series trying to bring his father's murderer to justice, by doing his own amateur investigation. His initial suspect was his step mother Jane, but he would also come to suspect his best friend, and gym manager, Victor. *Shannon Kenny as Jane Atkinson, was Big Jim Atkinson's beautiful, British, and much younger, wife (she was about the same age as his son). She was portrayed throughout the series as being very manipulative and was the series principal villain. Her character can in part be seen as a parody of Joan Collins' character, Alexis, on the television series Dynasty. :After the death of her husband she tried to take over running the Survival Gym. However her stepson, Kent, remained a constant rival for the job. In order to win him over she set about seducing him and making him her second husband. Kent, however, believed she had murdered his father and was initially reluctant. After Big Jim's secretary confessed to the murder, it appeared that Jane and Kent would begin to have a relationship. Unbeknownst to Kent, Jane paid the secretary to confess. :Another scheme she had to secure the Survival Gym franchise was to become pregnant with Big Jim's child, using his previously frozen sperm. However, Jane discovered that she was in fact barren, and had to ask Cleo, to be a surrogate. *Amy Pietz as Bronwyn Jones, was Kent's cousin, and a local television news anchor. At the start of the series she was a closeted lesbian, Robert Bingham would try and blackmail her in order to keep her secret. Bronwyn would respond by outing herself at the end of one of her own news casts. This would cause the news director to exploit this fact. For example, he designed a news promo about problems in health care as: \\"Naughty Nurses\\" featuring two beautiful women in nursing outfits having a pillow fight. Then the announcer would say the local news channel's name, \\"...featuring Bronwyn Jones, lesbian!\\" By the series end Bronwyn was considering leaving the broadcast to escape exploitation. *Wendy Benson as Cleo, was a trainer and struggling actress working at the gym. Seen primarily as innocent and naive by her fellow gym staffers, she was in fact a woman with a mysterious past. This would be hinted at by the fact that she sometimes would speak with a Southern accent when she was alone. She routinely received phone calls from a mysterious woman, also with a Southern accent, who called her Lorna Louise. :It was later revealed that the mysterious woman was in fact her mother. Her mother was a madam at a brothel. She did not know who her real father was, only that she was conceived around the time the circus was in town. Cleo/Lorna Louise believed that her father was a clown, she never met him during the show. :The staff and clientele at Survival Gym never knew this and Cleo was often used as a pawn in the power struggles between Jane and Kent Atkinson. For example, Jane asked her to be a surrogate mother for Big Jim's baby, in an attempt to control Survival Gym. When Kent found out, he seduced Cleo, and then asked her not to agree to be the surrogate. What he did not know, was Cleo had already had the procedure. When Cleo actually ended up being pregnant she did not know who her baby's father was, Kent, or Big Jim, but believed whoever it was she would end up inheriting a huge fortune from the Atkinson family. However, she had also had sex with a director to get in his play, so there was a possibility that he was the father of her baby. The series ended without the father being revealed. *Michael Boatman as Garnet Hines, was a successful criminal defense attorney. He was portrayed as being amoral and doing whatever it takes to get his client acquitted. One of Garnet's past clients was Robert Bingham, who he failed to get acquitted, but did get him a light prison term. :Garnet Hines's most infamous client was Guy Davore, the Carnivore. Guy was accused of being a serial killer and a cannibal. Garnet with the help of Dr. Gold would get Guy acquitted, however both men would come to regret this action. *Nestor Carbonell as Gianni was a gigolo, who used the gym to meet potential \\"dates\\". Gianni grew up poor and was determined never to be poor again. Believing that he had few talents, he decided the only way he could live a life of luxury was living off of women. The woman who he would become involved with was a wealthy widow named Dottie. :Gianni's other love interest was a trainer, named Angela, who had a crush on him. Although there was some chemistry between them, her lack of monetary success, initially led him to reject her. However, he would eventually dump the financially secure Dottie, for a romantic relationship with Angela. Ironically, shortly after choosing Angela, Gianni suffered a back injury that temporarily paralyzed him and caused him to be supported by Angela's limited finances. *Steve Henneberry (best known as Tower from American Gladiators) as Sam Pippin, was a sweet, but not too bright and insecure bodybuilder, and trainer at the gym. Sam had a crush on Bronwyn, when he did not initially know she was a lesbian. His business partner Robert Bingham blackmailed Bronwyn, into going on a date with Sam in order to build up Sam's confidence. After Bronwyn came out, Sam attempted suicide by throwing himself off the Gym's roof, but Robert talked him down. *Jerry Levine as Robert/Roberta Bingham, was a former stockbroker on Wall Street, who was convicted of insider trading. At the start of the show he was just released from prison and on parole. While on parole he had been given an ankle monitor, which limited how far he could move inside the gym. :Robert had initially hired Sam to be his trainer. Robert soon came up with a plan to have Sam star in a series of exercise videos. Robert would do anything to help Sam, from blackmailing Bronwyn to date Sam, to providing him with steroids to help him win a bodybuilding contest. Despite doing these unscrupulous acts, he also showed genuine compassion towards Sam, like talking him out of committing suicide even though it violated Robert's parole (Sam tried to kill himself outside of Robert's ankle bracelet's range). Given that he had a good reason, Robert's parole was not violated. :Because he tried to blackmail her, Bronwyn had a strong dislike for Robert. This was initially mutual due to the fact he found her to be arrogant. However in a strange twist, he developed a crush on her. Since she was a lesbian, he decided to dress in drag as Roberta to Angela and Gianni's wedding to win her over. Bronwyn apparently was attracted to \\"Roberta\\", however the series was not renewed and this plot element was never fully developed. *Alan Ruck as Dr. Marshall Gold, a psychiatrist who worked out at the gym. Marshall was notorious for constantly revealing things told to him in the confidence of his practice. He was the one who told Robert that Bronwyn was a lesbian. Dr. Gold admitted that if he was bored listening to a patient, he would reread some of the details about Bronwyn's sex life. :Marshall was also the expert witness in the Guy Davore case. It was his testimony that Guy was sane that led, in part, to Guy's acquittal. Dr. Gold would later come to regret this. *T.E. Russell as Victor, was the manager of the New York branch of Survival Gym and Kent's best friend. Victor was often poorly treated by Big Jim and thus became a suspect in his murder. Victor's friendship with Kent came into question when Kent told the police that Victor was probably the killer. After Big Jim's secretary confessed, Victor would refuse to be friends with Kent because he had suspected him of the murder. *Michole White as Angela, was a trainer at the gym who had a crush on Gianni. Her parents ran a pet store specializing in birds and fish. While they did not have much money, they did love each other deeply. This is what Angela wanted, someone she could share a romantic relationship with. :Gianni, being a gigolo, initially resisted being with her because of her lack of money, however, he realized he did in fact love her. After a brief courtship he would propose marriage. The final episode of the series was Angela and Gianni's wedding at the gym, the place where they met. === Notable guest stars === *Adam West as \\"Big\\" Jim Atkinson, was the founder and president of the Survival Gym chain. Big Jim was seen occasionally in flashbacks and heard in voice-overs, after his death in the first episodes. Big Jim was portrayed as sort of a macho, self-promoting business man. He was constantly challenging people to feats of strength contests. == Episodes == #Pilot (January 11, 1995) #Episode 2 (January 11, 1995) #Episode 3 (January 18, 1995) #Episode 4 (January 25, 1995) #Episode 5 (February 1, 1995) #Episode 6 (February 8, 1995) #Episode 7 (February 15, 1995) #Episode 8 (February 22, 1995) #Episode 9 (March 1, 1995) #Episode 10 (April 26, 1995) #Episode 11 (May 10, 1995) #Episode 12 (May 17, 1995) #Episode 13 (May 24, 1995) == References == == External links == * * Category:1995 American television series debuts Category:1995 American television series endings Category:The WB original programming Category:1990s American sitcoms Category:Television shows set in New York City Category:Television series by Warner Bros.

A co-production of the National Film Board of Canada (NFB) and Mikrofilm AS of Norway, it has won both the Academy Award2007Oscars.org and Genie Award for best animated short film. ==Synopsis== The film follows Kaspar Jørgensen, a Danish poet in the 1940s who is seeking inspiration. At the suggestion of his psychiatrist, Dr. Mørk, he travels to Norway to meet the famous author Sigrid Undset. However, after arriving in Norway, he meets Ingeborg, a farmer's daughter, and they fall in love. He proposes to her, but discovers that she is already engaged, at her father's wish. She promises not to cut her hair until they are reunited, and Kaspar returns to Denmark. Later, Ingeborg's husband dies in an accident, and Ingeborg sends a letter to Kaspar. However, it is accidentally dropped by the postman, and never arrives. When Sigrid Undset dies, both Kaspar and Ingeborg travel to the funeral; they are reunited, and later marry and live in Copenhagen. As Kaspar tells Ingeborg that he loves her long hair, she does not cut it, but when Kaspar trips over it and breaks his thumb, she sends for her hairdresser from Norway. On the way, the hairdresser meets a young man on the train, who was also travelling to Copenhagen to meet Kaspar, his favourite poet. The two fall in love, and are revealed to be the narrator's parents. ==Production== Kove first became involved with the National Film Board, an agency of the Government of Canada, after her first year at Concordia University in Montreal. After working there as an assistant for some years, she wrote and pitched a script to the company, which led to her career as a director and animator. She first wrote the script for The Danish Poet some time ago, though she says that she \\"can’t really remember when\\". Production was split between Marcy Page, of the National Film Board, and Lise Fearnley, of Mikrofilm AS in Norway, and took roughly three years, although Kove took a year off for maternity leave. The film was made using hand-drawn traditional animation, with pencil on paper, and then scanned and digitally coloured, with about half of the animation by Kove, and the rest divided between animators in Montreal and Norway. Kove's style is simplistic, which she says is less a specific style choice than \\"quite simply [...] the only one I know how to do.\\" The backgrounds were painted by Montreal artist Anne Ashton. Narrator Liv Ullmann was selected for the film because Kove liked her voice and \\"thought that her delivery would be right for the story\\"; she reaffirmed this after the film's release, stating that Ullmann was \\"just right\\". She thanked Ullmann in her Academy Award acceptance speech, saying that \\"it was really amazing of her to participate in this.\\" ==Origins== Kove's first ideas for The Danish Poet began when she went through a period of self- assessment; she wanted to write a story about what she described as when \\"you reach a turning point or a milestone and you look back and you think 'how in the heck did I get here?' [...] And you realize that the answer lies somewhere in a complex web of all kinds of stuff, like genetic make-up, upbringing, coincidences, choices you made along the way, missed opportunities, [and] lucky breaks.\\" She felt that it was a natural choice to centre on a relationship between two people, \\"because relationships, and especially the romantic ones, play a huge role in shaping our lives, and also, obviously, in creating new ones.\\" Kove originally wanted to make the film biographical, based on a story her father told her: he had dreamed of being an artist, and made an appointment with an art teacher to ask if he was good enough to make it in the art world. However, he stood at the top of the stairs and decided not to go, eventually deciding to go to architecture school (as his parents wanted) where he met his wife. Kove's inspiration was drawn from the fact that her existence seemed to hinge on that decision, because \\"if the artist had said, 'Oh, you must paint,' you know, then in all likelihood he would never have met my mother, and, you know, that would have been it for my chances.\\" However, Kove felt the story was too personal, and rewrote it to be fictional. ==Themes== The film's main theme shows the effect that coincidence and chance can have on the course of life—like the bad weather, angry dog, hungry goats, slippery planks, and careless postman that change the course of both Kaspar's and Ingeborg's lives—and shows, as the film's website states, that \\"seemingly unrelated factors might play important roles in the big scheme of things after all.\\" In an interview, Kove said that \\"what I'm trying to get across is just that I think life is really a kind of a meandering journey ... a lot is really up to chance\\". However, Kove has also said that she'd like people to be able to interpret the film in different ways: > I’d like them to walk away thinking it’s a film that can be interpreted in > more than one way. I’m happy when I hear from people who’ve seen the short > that it makes them think about the kind of strangeness where we find > inspiration for art and where we find love, and the kind of miraculousness > of just being alive and having a life. I’m pleased when people get that out > of it. She also identifies several subplots of artistic inspiration, as Kaspar \\"finds [inspiration] within himself\\", and not within another writer, and a \\"subtext ... about nationalism and how much emphasis we in the western world put on stereotypes and on which country we're from\\". ==Awards== The Danish Poet received the Academy Award for Animated Short Film at the 79th Academy Awards in 2007,Jaden Smith and Abigail Breslin present Short Film Oscars®-Oscars on YouTube a second Oscar nomination (and first win) for Kove, who was nominated in 2000 for her first professional film, My Grandmother Ironed the King's Shirts, also co-produced by the NFB. The win also marked the first Norwegian film to win an Academy Award since Thor Heyerdahl's Kon-Tiki won for best documentary in 1952. The Danish Poet also won Best Animated Short at the 27th Genie Awards in 2007, and a Norwegian-language picture book adaptation was nominated for the 2007 Brage Prize.

The line currently runs from the Lutherville Light Rail Stop to International Circle near Hunt Valley Town Center, serving the Timonium and Cockeysville areas. The bus route is the successor to various branches of Routes 8, 8B, and 55. Route 93 replaced the entirety of Route 9 on June 18, 2017 due to the BaltimoreLink bus system overhaul, with expanded service to Downtown Towson. ==History== Route 9 started operating in 1974 as a replacement for other various lines that served Baltimore's York Road corridor north of Towson; historically, all portions of York Road Towson and southward were served by the no. 8 streetcar and bus lines. The first transit service to operate along the York Road corridor north of Towson was the failed Towson and Cockeysville Railroad, which operated from 1912 to 1923.Harwood, p. 99. Prior to the introduction of the current route in 1974, the no. 9 designation was used for several other Baltimore area public transit services. These included the Halethorpe Streetcar, which used that designation from 1900 to 1926 before being absorbed by the no. 3 streetcar (currently served by Route 35), the Ellicott City Streetcar, which operated from 1927 to 1952 before conversion to a bus route (limited service between Baltimore and Ellicott City is currently provided on Route 150; local service along the U.S. 40 corridor of Baltimore is currently provided by Route 23),Harwood, p. 42-55. and as a shuttle service from Sparrows Point to Ft. Howard that operate from 1971 to 1973 (service to Ft. Howard was provided by Route 4 from then until 1993, and Route 6 from 1997 to 1998, and is no longer provided). ===Origin=== Originally, Route 9 operated to/from downtown Baltimore during peak hours, and had a southern terminus at Towson State University at other times. Weekend service was not provided then, was not introduced until 1986, and even then was very limited. As development of northern Baltimore County continued, the Route 9 was improved. Selected trips and deviations were added to International Circle, Loveton Business Park, and developing residential, commercial, and industrial areas. In 1992, in conjunction with the opening of Baltimore's Central Light Rail line, route 9 line was modified. All service south of Northern Parkway was eliminated, except for a few early morning northbound trips before the opening of the light rail, which followed the line's old route.MTA June 1992 schedule changes In 1993, midday and evening service, which previously operated hourly, were provided in 15-minute intervals. The southern off-peak weekday terminus was moved to the Lutherville Light Rail Stop to eliminate duplication with Route 8. Weekend service was also improved to every 45 minutes on Saturday and hourly on Sunday.MTA January 1993 schedule changes In 1997, service was reduced, as the light rail was extended to Hunt Valley, and much of the Route 9's ridership was projected to use the light rail instead. Midday service was reduced by 50%. In 2000, Route 9 was combined with Route 8. Selected Route 8 trips were extended north of Lutherville to Hunt Valley. This provided single- seat bus service along all portions of the York Road corridor.MTA January 2000 schedule changes ==Overhaul and return of service== In October 2005, as part of the Greater Baltimore Bus Initiative, a comprehensive overhaul plan for the region's transit system, Route 9 line was re-introduced after a 5-year absence. It was split from the long Route 8, which returned to its old route. In addition, trips to Loveton Business Park were no longer provided. Initially, International Circle service also was not provided, but this was reintroduced in February 2006.MTA February 2006 schedule changes Initially all trips on route 9 would terminate at Hunt Valley Town Centre but due to weight restrictions Hunt Valley Town Centre management prohibited MTA buses from being allowed to enter the premises in June 2005 before the reinstatement of route 9. So route 9 was routed to International Circle as a layover point on the north end of route 9 as other layover ideas did not work out. Route 9 currently operates between the Lutherville Light Rail Stop and International Circle via its basic route at all times, with no extended trips or branches. Since being reintroduced, changes have been made, mostly during peak hours, to improve frequencies and schedule adherence. ===BaltimoreLink=== As part of the BaltimoreLink transit overhaul, on June 18, 2017 Route 9 will be replaced by LocalLink 93, which will follow the current route, and extend the south-bound end to Towson. ==References== ==External links== *Route 9 map and schedule, effective June 14, 2009 09 Category:1974 establishments in Maryland ","title":"Route 93 (MTA Maryland LocalLink)"},{"id":"9072503","text":"Anthony Howard Ensor (born August 17, 1949, Dublin, Ireland), commonly called Tony Ensor, was an Ireland rugby union player.

The medium of the State Oracle currently resides with the current Dalai Lama in Dharamsala, India. Prior to the Himalayan diaspora resulting from the annexation of Tibet by the People's Republic of China,For greater detail regarding the annexation refer: Tibetan sovereignty debate. the Nechung Oracle was the designated head of the Nechung monastery in Tibet.Pearlman, Ellen (2002). Tibetan Sacred Dance: a journey into the religious and folk traditions. Rochester, Vermont, USA: Inner Traditions. , p.94 ==History== In Tibet and throughout the greater Himalayan region, oracles have played, and continue to play, an important part in revelation, religion, doctrine, and prophecy. In Tibet, the Nechung Oracle and other oracles on occasion, have also played principal roles assisting governmental decision-making and providing intelligence on pressing matters of state, and perhaps most importantly aid in the provision of security for the 14th Dalai Lama of Tibet. There are a number of oracular traditions within the Himalaya of which the Nechung is but one. The word \\"oracle\\" is used by Tibetans to refer to the spirit, deity, or entity that temporarily (or various styles of periodic or ongoing possession depending on the tradition) possesses or enters those men and women who act as media between the phenomenal natural world and the subtle spiritual realms. These media are, therefore, known as kuten, which literally means, \\"the physical basis\\". Post-possession, the medium may require protracted convalescence. According to Bell, \\"the cult of Pehar at Nechung Monastery experienced a meteoric rise in popularity in the seventeenth century primarily through the deliberate efforts of the Fifth Dalai Lama and his regent Sangyé Gyatso.\\" The tulku of the institution of the Dalai Lama consults the oracle known as the Nechung Oracle, which is considered the Official State Oracle of the government of Tibet. The Nechung was formerly a Nyingma tradition. The fourteenth Dalai Lama gives a complete description of the process of trance and possession in his book Freedom in Exile.The Government of Tibet in Exile. Nechung - The State Oracle of Tibet. ==Beginnings== Pearlman frames the inauguration and installation of the tradition of the State Oracle by identifying key stakeholders: Padmasambhava, Samye, Vajrakilaya, Dharma, sangha, genius loci: > \\"When Padmasambhava consecrated Samye Monastery with the Vajrakilaya dance, > he tamed the local spirit protector, Pehar Gyalp, and bound him by oath to > become the head of the entire hierarchy of Buddhist protective spirits. > Pehar, later known as Dorje Drakden, became the principal protector of the > Dalai Lamas, manifesting through the Nechung Oracle. > According to the Dalai Lama, \\"Tibetans rely on oracles for various reasons. > The purpose of the oracles is not just to foretell the future. They are > called upon as protectors and sometimes used as healers. However, their > primary function is to protect the Buddha Dharma and its practitioners.\\" The rite of the Oracle possessing the kuten is ancient, entering the tradition from the Bonpo and Ngagpa, and traditionally involves a detailed evocative liturgy including such elements as fanfare, dance, mudra and mantra to invoke the Oracle who forcefully projects their mindstream via the discipline of phowa, temporarily possessing the physical basis. ==Key prophecies== Pearlman relates two prophecies prophesied by the Nechung Oracle: the famous prophecy that during the Year of the Tiger Tibet would encounter a grave and \\"great difficulty\\"; and the fortuitous second prophecy outlining the flight from Tibet of the Jewel of the Compassionate Ocean, an epiphet for the Dalai Lama: > \\"In 1947 Lobsang Jigme, the Tibetan State Oracle, prophesied that in the > Year of the Tiger, 1950, Tibet would face great difficulty. In 1951, Lobsang > Jigme fell ill, some say because of his repeated troubling visions, and for > years was unable to walk without assistance. In 1959, after predicting the > Dalai Lama's flight, Lobsang Jigme spent two months walking to India with > His Holiness. His illness was eventually cured.\\" ==Ceremony== Pearlman describes the ritual investiture of the Nechung Oracle that is constituted by sacred symbols and iconography in the colours of the Five Pure Lights and Mahabhuta and includes lungta, bija and dhvaja: > \\"On formal occasions, the Kuten is dressed in an elaborate costume > consisting of several layers of clothing topped by a highly ornate robe of > golden silk brocade, which is covered with ancient designs in red and blue > and green and yellow [colors traditionally subscribed to the Mahabhuta]. On > his chest he wears a circular mirror which is surrounded by clusters of > turquoise and amethyst, its polished steel flashing with the Sanskrit mantra > corresponding to Dorje Drakden. Before the proceedings begin, he also puts > on a sort of harness, which supports four flags and three victory banners. > Altogether, this outfit weighs more than seventy pounds and the medium, when > not in trance, can hardly walk in it.\\"Pearlman, Ellen (2002). Tibetan Sacred > Dance: a journey into the religious and folk traditions. Rochester, Vermont, > USA: Inner Traditions. , p.94-95 In addition to this regalia, when the Kuten's trance deepens, the assistants who have been supporting the medium place a headdress on his head which weighs approximately 30 pounds, though in former times it weighed over 80. The circular mirror is a divine attribute and tool, known as a melong (Tibetan: \\"mirror\\"), that is a common symbol of Dzogchen and Dzogchen teachings. == In popular culture == Martin Scorsese's 1997 biopic Kundun portrays the Dalai Lama consulting the Nechung Oracle. ==See also== *Dorje Drakden *Mo (divination) *Tenma goddesses ==Notes== ==Further reading== *Havnevik, Hanna.

The three remaining committee members are appointees commissioned directly by the Financial Services Commission and the other two are recommended by the Minister of the Ministry of Strategy and Finance and the Governor of the Bank of Korea. ===The Board of Directors=== The Board of Directors, as the highest executive body of the KDIC, is composed of one President, one Executive Vice President, four internal Executive Directors, and seven non-Executive Directors. The auditor may express opinions at Board meetings, but cannot participate in the Board's voting process. ===Organizational Structure=== As of the end of Sep. 2010, the KDIC is composed of ten departments, five offices and one bureau. The total number of employees stands at 563. This number included general employees, and special employees such as attorneys, doctoral researchers, conservators, bankruptcy estate trustees, examiners, etc. ==Main rolesPolicy and fund management=== The KDIC implements deposit insurance policies and manages funds. The funds in the KDIC are divided into the Deposit Insurance Fund Bond Redemption Fund and the (New) Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF). The Redemption Fund was established to complete the financial restructuring and recover public funds injected during the first and second rounds of financial assistance following the 1997 East Asian financial crisis. The new DIF could start with a clean state from then. The annual premium revenue of the DIF in 2009 was KRW 1.24 trillion. ===Ongoing risk surveillance=== The KDIC identifies troubled financial institutions through on and off-site monitoring and requests financial institutions or supervisory authorities to take appropriate actions to prevent failure. ===Support of insolvent financial institutions=== The KDIC supports an insolvent financial institution in accordance with the following four principles: Least Cost Principle, Loss- Sharing Principle, Self-Help Effort Principle and Transparency/Objectivity Principle. And the KDIC usually uses one of two methods: deposit payoff and financial assistance. Financial assistance includes loan extension and fund deposit, purchase of assets and assumption of liabilities, equity investment and contributions. ===Resolution of failed financial institutions=== The KDIC resolves a failed financial institution in the least costly manner. Employing a variety of measures from deposit payoff, to purchase & assumption, to the establishment of a bridge bank and to an open bank assistance, the KDIC tries to make the resolution process as orderly and timely as possible. The total number of insured institutions stood at 320, and the amount of insured deposits totaled KRW 2,037,830 billion. (Figures as of June 2009) The coverage limit is KRW 50 million, which is almost USD 45,000, including the principal and interest. ===Recovery of public funds=== For efficient recovery of public funds injected in insolvent financial institutions, the KDIC can have its staff act as a manager or a trustee of such institutions. Also, the KDIC has the authority to file a liability suit or a damage claim on behalf of insolvent financial institutions. ===Investigation=== The KDIC pursues liability claims against former/incumbent employees of insolvent financial institutions for their role in the failure. It also conducts investigations of owners, employees, etc. of default debtor corporations who failed to pay back the money they owed and thus are partially responsible for the insolvency. In addition, the KDIC conducts thorough investigations of concealed properties of insolvency-implicated parties to secure the assets for damage claims against them. ==Protection of DepositsTypes of Insured Institutions=== The KDIC insures banks, financial investment companies, life and non-life insurance companies, merchant banks and mutual savings banks. As of the end of 2009, 321 financial institutions' products were under the protection of the KDIC. ===Insurance Coverage=== The KDIC insures bank deposits, customer's deposits for securities trading, individual insurance policies, etc. On the other hand, the KDIC does not insure CDs, RPs, securities, CPs, etc. Also, the deposit insurance excludes deposits by government and insured financial institutions, etc. from its insured products. ===Coverage Limit=== The KDIC covers up to 50 million won ($42,823) per depositor. It is 2.5 times of Korea's per capita GDP ($17,074) (Statistics are as of the end of 2009.) ===Insurance Premium=== The premium rates are determined on the basis of the average annual balance of deposits in each sector. The rates are 0.08% for banks, 0.15% for financial investment companies, insurance companies and merchant banks and 0.35% for mutual savings banks. ==International CooperationMOUs=== The KDIC currently has MOUs on Information Sharing and Mutual Cooperation with nine deposit insurers worldwide. ==Seoul Guarantee Insurance Company== Seoul Guarantee Insurance Company (SGIC, 서울보증보험) is a financial services company incorporated in South Korea. Headquartered in Seoul, SGIC is the largest provider of surety and trade credit insurance. It is fully owned by Korea Deposit Insurance Corporation, a government institution that insures bank deposits. The company was formed after the merger between Hankuk and Korea Fidelity and Surety Corporation during the economic crisis that hit Korea in 1998. A mass layoff and restructuring followed. == References International Association of Deposit Insurers (IADI) * Knowledge Sharing Program (KSP) * Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) * Official Homepage of SGIC Category:Banks established in 1996 Category:Government-owned companies of South Korea Category:Finance in South Korea Category:Financial regulation Category:Deposit insurance Category:Companies based in Seoul Category:Regulation in South Korea ","title":"Korea Deposit Insurance Corporation"},{"id":"9072534","text":"Kathryn Elizabeth Cramer (born April 16, 1962) is an American science fiction writer, editor, and literary critic. ==Early years== Kathryn Cramer is the daughter of physicist John G.

The group's primary product is a premium beer with an alcohol strength of 4.5 volume used to be 4.8. The beer was founded in 1989 by Karan Bilimoria, and Arjun Reddy – who thought that Britain needed a smoother, less gassy lager, which would appeal to both ale drinkers and lager drinkers alike. A blend of water, malted barley, yeast, rice, maize wheat and four varieties of hops is used to produce the required characteristics. In June 2011 Molson Coors bought a controlling interest in Cobra. As of 2014, Cobra Beer is primarily produced in Burton upon Trent, Rodenbach in Belgium and in Patna in the Indian state of Bihar. ==History== Lord Bilimoria – founder and chairman, Cobra Beer Partnership Cobra Beer was founded in 1989 by Karan Bilimoria, then aged 27 and £20,000 in debt. A Cambridge law graduate and qualified chartered accountant, Bilimoria launched Cobra Beer when it became clear to him that Britain needed a smoother, less gassy lager that appealed to both ale drinkers and lager drinkers alike, and that complemented all types of cuisine. Bilimoria said that \\"the (British) lager was too fizzy, too harsh and too bloating. It meant that I couldn't eat or drink as much as I would like. At the same time, I found real ale to be great in a pub, but too bitter and heavy with food. So I came up with the idea of creating a beer with the refreshment of a lager, but with the smoothness of an ale.\\"Interview with Karan Bilimoria on BBC News website 6 August 2014 https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-28439834 Although originally intended to be named 'Panther', the name was changed to 'Cobra' when a focus group found the latter more appealing. The first shipment of Cobra was imported to the UK from the Bangalore-based Mysore Brewery in 1990, at the start of the early 1990s recession, however, large consumer demand and increased import costs prompted Bilimoria to move production to the United Kingdom in the mid-1990s. From 1996, Cobra Beer was brewed under contract by Charles Wells Ltd and experienced strong growth in sales for the next ten years. Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, Cobra experienced double-digit growth. In 2005, the company's premium pilsner, King Cobra, was launched. Brewed at Belgium's Rodenbach Brewery, it is currently the only pilsner-style lager to be fermented in the bottle. The company's alcohol-free beer, Cobra Zero, was also launched in 2005. The beer was well received at launch, being ranked by the Daily Mirror as \\"head and shoulders above the rest\\". However, business losses accelerated in 2007 with total losses for the trading year to August 2007 reaching £13.6m on an annual turnover of around £45m. As of 2008, the business was approximately £26 million in debt and had borrowings from venture capitalists attracting interest at a daily compound rate of 15%.Source: Annual Report and Accounts posted with Companies House in May 2008 Despite this, Cobra continued to accelerate its sales growth. Cobra's half year sales figures for the period from 1 August 2008 to 31 January 2009 showed growth in volume terms of 21%.source: ACNielsen 2009 It is this strategy of growing sales, instead of concentrating on the \\"bottom line\\" which may have caused the company's financial problems. On Friday 29 May 2009 the company went into administration, owing an estimated £75 million to suppliers. On the same day, the business was rescued through the formation of the Cobra Beer Partnership Limited, a joint-venture between Molson Coors and Karan Bilimoria, with Molson Coors owning 50.1% of the shares and Bilimoria appointed as Chairman. In June 2011 it was reported that Molson Coors had also purchased a 51% stake in Cobra India, renamed as Molson Coors Cobra India. The remaining 49% of the venture is controlled by Bilimoria. As of 2014, Cobra Beer has continued to experience increased sales - albeit at a slower place that it experienced during the 1990s. Since the formation of the joint venture with Molson Coors, growth has averaged between 7% and 10% in terms of year-on- year expansion and in 2013 had turn-over of £59.1 million and profit before tax of £7.7 million. As of November 2014, Cobra currently has a market share of over 45% of all licensed Indian restaurants within the United Kingdom. In February 2014, Cobra launched a new advertising campaign with the Farringdon- based agency, Karmarama. Entitled, 'Meet the Boss' - the advertisement was well received in a number of areas, including being dubbed 'Ad of the Week' by the communications agency, Stratton Craig. In the first three months of the campaign, Cobra saw 23% growth in volume sales in the off-trade, and a 77% volume growth in bars over a similar period. ==Products== The Cobra Beer range currently consists of three beers: Cobra Premium (4.8%), an extra-smooth premium beer and is currently sold in 330ml and 620ml bottles. A draft version (4.3%) is also available. Cobra Zero (0.0%), a non-alcoholic version of Cobra Premium, sold since 2005. King Cobra (7.5%), a double fermented Pilsner-style lager.

Its official purposes are to protect the environment and the several tribes of Xingu indigenous peoples in the area. ==Location== The Xingu Indigenous Park is on the upper Xingu River in the north east of the state of Mato Grosso, in the south of the Amazon biome. It covers , with savannah and drier semi-deciduous forests in the south transitioning to Amazon rain forest in the north. There is a rainy season from November to April. The headwaters of the Xingu River are in the south of the park. The area covered by the park was defined in 1961 and covers parts of the municipalities of Canarana, Paranatinga, São Félix do Araguaia, São José do Xingu, Gaúcha do Norte, Feliz Natal, Querência, União do Sul, Nova Ubiratã and Marcelândia in the state of Mato Grosso. To the east is the basin of the Araguaia River, the main branch of the Tocantins. To the west and south is the Teles Pires branch of the Tapajos River. Much of the surrounding area, except to the north, is now heavily deforested. On the east side the deforested or unforested area extends northeast marking the approximate southeastern edge of the Amazon forest. At the center of the park a fan of rivers join. These are, counter-clockwise, Ferro River, Steinem, Ronuro, Jatoba, Batavi (or Tamitatoala), Auiiti, Culiseu, Culuene River and Tonguro. The indigenous lands in the Xingu area of Brazil ==History== In the Upper Xingu region was a highly self-organized pre- Columbian anthropogenic landscape, including deposits of fertile agricultural terra preta, black soil in Portuguese, with a network of roads and polities each of which covered about 250 square kilometers. The Upper Xingu region was heavily populated prior to European and African contact. Densely populated settlements developed from 1200 to 1600 CE.Hackenberger, Michael J. et al. \\"Amazonia 1492: Pristine Forest or Cultural Parkland?\\" Science Magazine. 25 July 2003 (retrieved 25 June 2011) Ancient roads and bridges linked communities that were often surrounded by ditches or moats. The villages were pre-planned and featured circular plazas. Archaeologists have unearthed 19 villages so far.Wren, Kathleen. \\"Lost cities of the Amazon revealed.\\" 'NBC News' (retrieved 25 June 2019) The upper Xingu was one of the last parts of Brazil to be reached by Europeans. John Hemming, Amazon Frontier, 1987, pp 400-415. From the north it was protected by the Xingu’s many rapids. From the south it was protected by thin settlement and the warlike Bororo and Xavante, among others. In 1884 Karl von den Steinen headed northwest from Cuiaba to some Christianized Bakairi on the upper Teles Pires. They led him two weeks east to the Batavi River where they built canoes. They went downstream and met some uncontacted Bakairi, as well as the Trumai and Suya. In the next 20 years other explorers entered the area, several of whom died. Percy Fawcett disappeared here in 1925. The national park was created after a campaign by the Villas-Bôas brothers for protection of the region. An account of the exploration of this area by the Villas-Bôas brothers and their efforts to protect the region is documented in the film Xingu (2012) and in the book by John Hemming, 'People of the Rainforest: The Villas Boas Brothers, Explorers and Humanitarians of the Amazon' (London, 2019). The Villas Boas and three anthropologists and activists had the radical idea of creating a vast area of forest protected solely for its indigenous inhabitants and invited scientists. This was put to the vice president of Brazil in 1952, at which a much larger park was proposed. However, the proposal was opposed by the state of Mato Grosso which began granting land within the proposed area to colonizing companies. Nine years of bitter political and media struggle ensued, until a new president of Brazil, Janio Quadros (a family friend of the Villas Boas) rammed it through as a presidential decree, but at a greatly reduced area to satisfy the state government. The park came into existence by decree 50.455 of 14 April 1961. (Adjustments were made on 31 July 1961, 6 August 1968 and 13 July 1971. The final demarcation of the perimeter was made in 1978.) The area was soon given the designation of \\"Indigenous Park\\" to cover the dual purpose of protecting the environment and the indigenous people, with all others excluded. It was the first such vast protected area in the world, and was the prototype of large indigenous territories throughout Amazonia which now protect a significant proportion of surviving tropical rain forests. The Xingu Indigenous Park was initially a presidential department, but is now subject to both the indigenous agency Funai and the environmental agency Ibama. Kamaiurá village at Xingu, yard. Indigenous people playing the uruá flute.. By the late 1990s livestock and soya farms to the north east of the park were starting to reach the park, as was deforestation to the west of the park. The effects of human activity outside the park were starting to pollute the waters of the park. The park remains as an island of forest and rivers increasingly threatened by polluting activity and deforestation outside its perimeter. ==Peoples== The people living within the boundaries of the Park are the Kamaiurá (355), Aweti (138), Mehinako (199), Wauja (321), Yawalapiti (208), Kalapalo (417), Kuikuro (415), Matipu (119), Nahukwá (105) and Trumai (120), who all share a common cultural system (population figures as of 2002). Also living within the Park are the Kaiabi (745), Kisêdjê (formerly Suia)(334), Yudja (formerly Juruna) (248), Tapayuna and Naruvotu peoples (population figures as of 2002). The Xingu area is of great interest because its rich indigenous cultures escaped devastation by Europeans and their diseases, thanks to a lack of rubber or mineral resources in the region, and to a waterfall-rapids barrier on the Xingu river. The first explorer to contact and write about the people of the region was the German anthropologist Karl von den Steinen in the 1880s, followed by short visits by other anthropologists and government surveyors. But the first outside permanent residence there was by the Sao Paulo brothers Orlando and Claudio Villas Boas, from 1947 to 1976. They devised a new system for helping indigenous peoples, as friends, helpers and equals rather than as colonialist officials. This is now adopted throughout Brazil. By slowly introducing change at a rate that the indigenous peoples wanted and could absorb, they brought them in only two generations to awareness of all aspects of modern Brazilian society without losing their respect for their traditional communal societies and way of life. Leaders of Xingu indigenous groups such as Aritana Yawalapiti and Raoni Metuktire, both trained by the Villas Boas, are now spokesmen for all Brazil's indigenous peoples on a world stage. Ever since the late 1970s the Director of the Xingu Indigenous Park has been indigenous, chosen by the area's chiefs. In the sixty years after contact by Von den Steinen, the Xingu peoples had been struck by alien diseases such as measles and influenza that reduced their small populations by two-thirds. The Villas Boas completely reversed this decline through an agreement with Professor Roberto Baruzzi of a Sao Paulo teaching hospital, whereby for over fifty years teams of volunteer doctors have inoculated and tended the Xingu peoples to the highest medical standards. In June 1925 the British artillery Lt.-Colonel Percy Harrison Fawcett visited the upper Xingu with his son and son's friend, by the same trail and river route used by all previous visitors. They spent a few days with the Aweti and Kalapalo peoples before either being killed by one of these tribes or continuing their journey into the forest. A trained surveyor, Fawcett had between 1907 and 1911 mapped four boundaries for the Bolivian government. A devotee of spiritualism, he became convinced that the Amazon forests might contain a lost city of an extremely ancient 'superior' civilization. After distinguished service in the First World War, Fawcett spent several years pursuing his fantasy in the north-east and other parts of Brazil, before the 1925 incursion to the Xingu. The disappearance of a British lieutenant- colonel, seeking a mystical city in Amazonian forests, caused a media sensation. David Grann wrote an article about this exploration, followed by an expanded book, The Lost City of Z (2009 ==Notes== ==Sources== * == External links == *Interview with Orlando Villas Boas on the history of the park (in Portuguese) *Maps of Xingu National Park *(in English) \\"Indigenous Park of the Xingu\\", Instituto Socioambiental Category:Protected areas established in 1961 Category:Indigenous peoples and the environment Category:Indigenous Territories (Brazil) Category:Protected areas of Mato Grosso Category:National parks of Brazil Category:1961 establishments in Brazil ","title":"Xingu Indigenous Park"},{"id":"9072557","text":"Jimmy Boubou Kébé (born 19 January 1984) is a former professional footballer who played as a right winger. Born in France, he represented Mali at international level. ==Club career== Born in Vitry-sur-Seine, France, Kébé started his footballing career at RC Lens. He played predominately for the B side before having successful loan spells at clubs Châteauroux and Boulogne. ===Reading=== On 16 January 2008, Kébé agreed to join Reading after being spotted by the then scout Brian McDermott, but his then club US Boulogne initially refused to let him end his season-long loan early. Kébé went on strike in order for Boulogne to release him from his loan spell early to join Reading. On 28 January 2008, Reading announced that Kébé had signed a 2½ year contract with them, moving for an undisclosed fee. He made his debut for Reading as a substitute, coming on for John Oster late into a 1–0 away defeat to Everton on 9 February 2008 and should have opened his Reading account minutes later. He scored his first Reading goal in the 1–2 home defeat against Southampton on 22 November 2008. On 6 December 2008 he was sent off for the first time in his Reading career for aiming an elbow towards Barnsley defender Dennis Souza. Kébé has since extended his contract until the summer of 2012. 2010 saw an up-turn in Kébé's goal-scoring form, notching up 13 goals in the Championship in the 2010 calendar year. On 21 August 2010, Kébé played his 100th game for Reading, appearing in a 1–1 draw with Nottingham Forest at the Madejski Stadium. The 2011–12 season saw a further development in Kébé's position at Reading, with a well-publicised dispute over his contract. Having shown himself to be one of Reading's key players in the 2010/11 Playoff push, the club were eager to see him sign a new long term contract to ward off interest from other clubs such as Leicester City as his contract was at the time due to run out at the end of the 2011–12 season. It soon became clear that Kébé wanted to stay at the club, but was reluctant to sign a two-year deal rather than the three-year deal he wanted. Reading could not afford to offer Kébé a three-year, despite being willing to make him one of their highest earners. This ongoing contract saga continued into the new year, with Reading manager Brian McDermott becoming increasingly resigned to the possibility of losing his prized winger. On 5 January 2012, it was confirmed that Reading had offered Kebe a new contract for the three years that he wanted. On 24 January 2012, following Anton Zingarevich's takeover of Reading, Kebe signed a new contract that will keep him at Reading until 2014. Kebe scored his first Premier League goal in a 2–2 draw at home to Newcastle United. He scored on his return from injury with a cool finish at home to Arsenal in a 5–2 defeat. His next goal came at home to West Bromwich Albion with a far post diving header, to pull one back with 8 minutes to go. This sparked a dramatic comeback from the Royals who scored two more late goals in the dying moments to win 3–2. In January 2013, Kébé announced on his official Twitter page that he had joined Newcastle United F.C.]Newcastle United, this was then picked up by several media outlets, only for Kébé to reveal that it had been a joke due to the number of French-speaking players Newcastle had recently signed. Kebe scored both the goals as Reading beat Sunderland at home 2–1, to move out of the relegation zone. After the match Reading captain Jobi McAnuff proclaimed Kébé to be a big player for Reading and a real sight to see when he's in full flow and I'm glad he's in our side when he's on song like this.\\". After the same game, Kébé also received special praise from manager Brian McDermott who proclaimed Kébé has been brilliant for me in the three years I have had this job. He then injured his groin in the early minutes of the 1–3 defeat to Everton on 2 March 2013, and was ruled out for the rest of the season. Reading were subsequently relegated from the Premier League at the end of the season. In August 2013, after 6 months out injured with a groin strain, Kébé was set to make a comeback for Reading in a match against Peterborough in the League Cup, however he controversially dropped out of contention with an injury, with manager Nigel Adkins unhappy about the timing after speculation linking Kébé with a move to Crystal Palace. Kébé revealed that he did not refuse to play and that he missed the game due to a hamstring injury. ===Crystal Palace=== On 31 August 2013, Kébé was signed by Ian Holloway for Crystal Palace on a three-year contract for an undisclosed fee. Kébé made his Palace debut against Manchester United on 14 September in a 2–0 away defeat at Old Trafford. Not long after Kébé joined the club, manager Ian Holloway left, and was replaced by Tony Pulis. On 8 January 2014, after dropping down the pecking order under Pulis, Leeds United approached Crystal Palace to take Kébé on loan for the remainder of the season and to reunite with his former Reading manager Brian McDermott. Pulis confirmed in his pre- match press conference on 9 January that Kébé had been in talks with Leeds and was set to join them on loan until the end of the 2013/14 season. on 23 January 2015 his Crystal Palace Contract was terminated. ===Leeds United (loan)=== On 10 January 2014, Kébé signed on a 6-month loan for Leeds United.

On 1 February 2014, only the day after the alleged sacking of Kébé's mentor Brian McDermott, Kébé scored his first goal for Leeds in a 5-1 victory against local rivals Huddersfield Town. On 1 March, in Leeds draw against Q.P.R. Kébé was subject of chants to be substituted, with Leeds fans calling for the arrival of Sam Byram due to Kébé's mixed displays since signing for the club. After the game manager Brian McDermott leapt to the defence of Kébé's performances and work rate and proclaimed he believed Kébé could still become a fans' favourite. ===Return to Crystal Palace, release and Real Mallorca=== At the end of the 2013/14 season, Leeds decided against making Kebe's loan permanent and he returned to Palace, where upon his return he was deemed surplus to requirements. He joined Real Mallorca in Spain but did not make a single appearance.

H., and E. D. Carlson (1982) Building effective Decision Support Systems. Englewood Cliffs, N.J.:Prentice-Hall, Inc. It is designed to assist the spatial planner with guidance in making land use decisions. A system which models decisions could be used to help identify the most effective decision path. An SDSS is sometimes referred to as a policy support system, and comprises a decision support system (DSS) and a geographic information system (GIS). This entails use of a database management system (DBMS), which holds and handles the geographical data; a library of potential models that can be used to forecast the possible outcomes of decisions; and an interface to aid the users interaction with the computer system and to assist in analysis of outcomes. ==Process== An SDSS usually exists in the form of a computer model or collection of interlinked computer models, including a land use model. Although various techniques are available to simulate land use dynamics, two types are particularly suitable for SDSS. These are cellular automata (CA) based modelsWhite, R., and G. Engelen (2000) High-resolution integrated modeling of spatial dynamics of urban and regional systems. Computers, Environment, and Urban Systems 24: 383–400. and Agent based models (ABM).Parker, D.

Annals of the Association of American Geographers 93 (2): 314–337. An SDSS typically uses a variety of spatial and nonspatial information, like data on land use, transportation, water management, demographics, agriculture, climate, epidemiology, resource management or employment. By using two or more known points in history the models can be calibrated and then projections into the future can be made to analyze different spatial policy options. Using these techniques spatial planners can investigate the effects of different scenarios, and provide information to make informed decisions. To allow the user to easily adapt the system to deal with possible intervention possibilities an interface allows for simple modification to be made. ==References== == External links == * International Cartographic Association (ICA), the world body for mapping and GIScience professionals * Maps module integrated into Decision Support System * Spatial Decision Support Consortium professional network and knowledge portal based on a spatial decision support ontology Category:Information systems Category:Decision support systems Category:Geographic information systems ","title":"Spatial decision support system"},{"id":"9072700","text":"{ class=\\"toccolours\\" style=\\"float:right; margin-left: 1em; text- align:center;\\" - ccccff; text-align:center;\\" colspan=\\"7\\"<> - ccccff; text-align:center;\\" width=14% width=14% width=14% width=14% width=14% width=14% width=14% - 1234567 - 891011121314 - 15161718192021 - 22232425262728 - 293031 - style=\\"background: lightblue\\" colspan=\\"7\\" align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"#ccccff\\" SH } Tir (, ) is the fourth month of the Solar Hijri calendar, which is the official calendar of Iran and Afghanistan.

The line currently runs from Sinai Hospital to City Hall, serving the communities of Pimlico, Arlington, Walbrook, and Bolton Hill, Coppin State College and the corridors of Garrison Boulevard and Eutaw Place. The line has the second-highest farebox recovery rate of all MTA bus lines. The bus route is the successor to the 16 Madison Avenue and 31 Garrison Boulevard streetcar lines. ==History== Route 91 started operating in 1987 after being split from the long Route 19. It has followed essentially the same route throughout its lifetime since then, only with the modification of service operating via the Rogers Avenue Metro Subway Station full-time. The line has faced various proposals for consolidation into other lines, but all have been fought. ===Origin=== The No. 31 Streetcar started operating in 1917. In 1952, it was absorbed by the No. 19 Streetcar, which in 1956 was converted to a bus. The no. 19 bus continued to operate from the Harford Road corridor to Garrison Boulevard for more than 30 years. The route was extended to Sinai Hospital when it absorbed the short lived Bus Route 90, which had operated from 1959 to 1960 between the Belvedere loop to Sinai. In 1992, in conjunction with the opening of the Central Light Rail line, MTA proposed to eliminate Route 91 and provide the service on other routes, primarily Route 13. However, this plan was scrapped as a result of public outcry. In 2005, as part of the Greater Baltimore Bus Initiative, a comprehensive overhaul plan for the region's transit system, MTA proposed once again to discontinue Route 91, and for the service to be absorbed by other routes, primarily by modifying Route 15 to Sinai Hospital. This plan was scrapped as a result of public outcry, especially because no bus service would have been provided on Eutaw Place in Bolton Hill. In 2006, as part of phase II of GBBI, MTA proposed for Route 91 to remain on its current route at a reduced frequency, and for a new Route M-5 to operate from the Mt. Washington Light Rail Stop to Penn-North Metro Subway Station with overlapping service between Pimlico and Penn-North. Such a plan is yet to be implemented, and GBBI was canceled in 2007. == See also == * History of MTA Maryland ==References== 91 Category:1987 establishments in Maryland ","title":"Route 91 (MTA Maryland)"},{"id":"9072763","text":"Mata is a municipality in Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil. == Paleontology == The city of Mata has large deposits of petrified trees.

After earning degrees in electrical engineering and business administration, while completing his Ph.D. in educational psychology, Digital Equipment Corporation hired Ahl as a marketing consultant in 1969 to develop its educational products line. He edited EDU, DEC's newsletter on educational uses of computers, that regularly published instructions for playing computer games on minicomputers. Ahl also talked DEC into publishing a book he had put together, 101 BASIC Computer Games. During the 1973 recession, DEC cut back on educational product development and Ahl was dismissed. He was rehired into a DEC division dedicated to developing new hardware, and his group became caught up in building a computer that was smaller than any yet built, intending to bring the new product into new markets such as schools. DEC built a machine combining a PDP-8 with a VT50 terminal, and another that crammed a PDP-11 into a small portable chassis. When it was presented to DEC's Operations Committee, the engineering side loved it but the sales side was worried it would cut into the sales of their existing lines. The decision ultimately fell to Ken Olsen, who finally stated that \\"I can't see any reason that anyone would want a computer of his own.\\" With that, the project was dead. Frustrated, Ahl left DEC in 1974, and started Creative Computing, one of the earliest magazines covering the microcomputer revolution.Freiberger & Swaine (2000). Fire in the Valley: The Making of The Personal Computer (Second Edition), McGraw Hill, . For the next decade Creative Computing covered the whole spectrum of hobbyist/home/personal computing, and although Ahl sold it to Ziff Davis in the early 1980s, he continued in his capacity as Editor-in-Chief. In 2010, David Ahl helped re-publish a Special 25th and 30th Anniversary Edition of two of his classic programming books, specifically for a new development environment for beginners, called Microsoft Small Basic.Ahl, David, \\"Further Thoughts (2010)\\" ==References== ==External links== * Basic Computer Games: Microsoft Small Basic Edition — Special 30th Anniversary Edition Edited by David H.

The fort was built by Bahamani rulers in between (1347-1527). Later (1527-1586) it came in possession of the Adilshahi dynasty.This fort was captured by Shivaji on 2 April 1663 from Adilshah. Previously known as Parali, it was renamed to Sajjangad. Fateullahakhan's army encircled the fort on 21 April 1700 and finally captured it on 6 June 1700. After it became the part of Mughal empire, it was renamed as \\"Navrastara\\".This fort was again won by Marathas. It remained in Maratha hands until the demise of the Maratha empire by the British in 1818. ==Present day== Sajjangad fortifications on the hill can be clearly seen. Sonale talav on the fort The maintenance of the fort and the Samadhi (final resting place) of Sadguru Shri Samarth Ramdas Swami is taken care by 'Shri Ramdas Swami Sansthan', a trust which has existed since the time of Shri Ramdas Swami. The daily routine of the trustees on the fort includes morning prayers, Abhishek and Puja, Maha Naivedya, Bhajans and reading of the manuscript Dasbodh written by Sant Ramdas. The fort is open for devotees from 5.00am to 9.00pm.(all days). Entry and exit beyond these hours is restricted. In the afternoon and at night, devotees are served free of cost food (Prasad) by Shri Ramdas Swami Sansthan. The trust also provides free of cost accommodation for devotees who wish to stay overnight on the fort. Every year during Shiv Jayanti thousands of devotees visit the shrine by walking up to it. ==Transportation== It is possible to reach the top of the fort by vehicle. From there one has to climb around two hundred and thirty steps to reach the gate of the fort. It is exactly 18 km from Satara city.

It features songs composed to the lyrics found in The Lord of the Rings by J. R. R. Tolkien and forms the end part of a complete musical interpretation of all lyrics in the book. The composer Stephen Eddins describes the music as \\"largely modal and melancholy\\". In his view the album has the correct tone for accompanying Tolkien's poems, but the music is not in the main \\"strong enough\\" to attract listeners who are not already Tolkien fans.

It is one of the three intermuscular spaces found in the axillary space. The other two spaces are: quadrangular space and triangular space. ==Borders== Two of its borders are as follows: * teres major - superior * long head of the triceps brachii - medial Some sources state the lateral border is the humerus, while others define it as the lateral head of the triceps. (The effective difference is relatively minor, though.) ==Contents== The radial nerve is visible through the triangular interval, on its way to the posterior compartment of the arm. Profunda Brachii also passes through the triangular interval from anterior to posterior. ==Additional images== File:Gray412-spaces.pngMuscles on the dorsum of the scapula, and the Triceps brachii. ==Triangular Interval Syndrome== Triangular Interval Syndrome (TIS) was described as a differential diagnosis for radicular pain in the upper extremity.Sebastian D. Triangular Interval Syndrome. A differential diagnosis for upper extremity radicular pain. Physiother Theory Pract. 2010 Feb;26(2):113-9. It is a condition where the radial nerve is entrapped in the triangular interval resulting in upper extremity radicular pain. The radial nerve and profunda brachii pass through the triangular interval and are hence vulnerable. The triangular interval has a potential for compromise secondary alterations in thickness of the teres major and triceps.Ng ABY, Borhan J, Ashton HR, Misra AN, Redfern DRM. Radial nerve palsy in an elite bodybuilder. Br J Sports Med 2003;37:185-186. It is described based on cadaveric studies that fibrous bands were commonly present between the teres major and triceps. When these bands were present, rotation of the shoulder caused a reduction in cross sectional area of the space. Normal resting postures of humeral adduction and internal rotation with scapular protraction may be speculated as a precedent for teres major contractures owing to the shortened position of this muscle in this position. In addition, hypertrophy of this muscle can occur secondary to weight training and potentially compromise the triangular interval with resultant entrapment of the radial nerve.McClelland D, Paxinos A. The anatomy of the quadrilateral space with reference to quadrilateral space syndrome. J Shoulder Elbow Surg. 2007 Nov 9 Shoulder dysfunctions have a potential for shortening and hypertrophy of the teres major. Shoulders that exhibit stiffness, secondary to capsular tightness, contribute to contracture and hypertrophy of the teres major.Jiu-jenk Lin, Jing-Lan Yang. Reliability and validity of shoulder tightness measurement in patients with stiff shoulders. Manual Therapy. 2006; 11 (146-52). Hence, restricted external rotation can encourage adaptive shortening and thickening of the internal rotators of the shoulder principally the teres major and subscapularis. One may speculate that the lateral arm pain presented in shoulder dysfunctions may be of a nerve origin secondary to adverse neural tension of the radial nerve. The triceps brachii has a potential to entrap the radial nerve in the triangular interval secondary to hypertrophy. The presence of a fibrous arch in the long head and lateral head further complicates the situation. Repeated forceful extension seen in weight training and sport involving punching may be a precedent to this scenario. The radial nerve is vulnerable as it passes through this space, for all of the reasons mentioned above. ==See also== *Axillary spaces * Quadrangular space * Triangular space ==References== ==External links== * Photo at ithaca.edu Category:Anatomy ","title":"Triangular interval"},{"id":"9073024","text":"is a Japanese actress, singer, and entertainer.

Apache Tuscany implements Service component architecture (SCA) which defines a flexible, service-based model for construction, assembly and deployment of network of services (existing and new ones). With SCA as its foundation, Tuscany was promoted to push handling of protocol out of the application business logic into pluggable bindings. As a result, protocols can be changed at only one time with minimal configuration changes. Tuscany also removes the need for applications to deal with infrastructure concerns such as security and transaction and handles this declaratively. Tuscany provides support for SCA 1.0 specification in Java. It also provides a wide range of bindings (web services, web20 bindings, etc.), implementation types (Spring, BPEL, Java, etc.) as well as integration with technologies such as web20 and OSGi. Tuscany was working on implementing SCA 1.1 that is being standardized at OASIS. Apache Tuscany also implements Service Data Objects (SDO) which provides a uniform interface for handling different forms of data, including XML documents, that can exist in a network of services and provides the mechanism for tracking changes. Tuscany supports the SCO and the SDO (2.01 for C++ / 2.1 for Java) specification. The Apache Software Foundation announced on August 2016 that the project was no longer maintained. == References == == External links == * Apache Tuscany Project Home Page * SCA Home Page at OASIS web site * \\"Introduction to SCA bindings\\" from Ch 7 of Tuscany SCA in Action Tuscany Category:Enterprise application integration Category:Service-oriented architecture-related products ","title":"Apache Tuscany"},{"id":"9073103","text":"Man-machine interaction (MMI) may refer to: *Control of machines in general using devices like steering wheel, automobile pedal, or button *Human–computer interaction ","title":"Man–machine interaction"},{"id":"9073107","text":"Life Time is the first full-length studio album by Rollins Band, fronted by ex-Black Flag singer, Henry Rollins. The album was produced by Ian MacKaye, well known in the genre of hardcore punk for his work with Minor Threat and as co-owner of the Dischord record label. MacKaye was also a childhood friend of Rollins, who acted as a roadie for MacKaye's band The Teen Idles. It was originally released in 1987 and included four live tracks recorded in Kortrijk, Belgium in October 1987. It was subsequently re-mastered and re- released in 1999 without the live tracks, but with the addition of three session tracks from the Do It album of 1987.

If nothing else, Life Time proves the detractors wrong. With Ian MacKaye of Fugazi in the production chair, Rollins Band was able to distance themselves from Black Flag with a tight, visceral, and sometimes bluesy album. While more abrasive than later Rollins Band releases, this is worth picking up to better understand the progression of Rollins Band's unique style of emotional funk metal. Remastered and re- released in 1999, the CD has a better sound, but it sacrifices the live tracks (which appear on the original Texas Hotel CD release). The outtakes from the Life Time sessions, however -- \\"Do It,\\" \\"Move Right In,\\" and \\"Nest Time,\\" originally released as the album Do It in 1988—are included.\\". ==Personnel== *Henry Rollins – vocals *Chris Haskett – guitar *Andrew Weiss – bass guitar *Sim Cain – drums *Produced by Ian MacKaye ==References== ==External links== *Dischord Records album page *Comeinandburn.com album page Category:1987 albums Category:Rollins Band albums Category:Buddah Records albums ","title":"Life Time (Rollins Band album)"},{"id":"9073116","text":"Comet Pons may refer to any one of these comets: * C/1801 N1 * C/1802 Q1 * C/1804 E1 * C/1806 V1 (a.k.a. 1806 II) * C/1808 F1 (a.k.a. 1808 I) * C/1808 M1 (a.k.a. 1808 II) * C/1810 Q1 * C/1811 W1 (a.k.a. 1811 II) * C/1813 C1 (a.k.a. 1813 I) * C/1813 G1 (a.k.a. 1813 II) * C/1816 B1 * C/1817 Y1 (a.k.a. 1818 II) * C/1818 W2 (a.k.a. 1818 III) * C/1822 K1 (a.k.a. 1822 III) * C/1822 N1 (a.k.a. 1822 IV) * C/1825 N1 (a.k.a. 1825 IV) * C/1825 P1 (a.k.a. 1825 II) * C/1825 V1 (a.k.a. 1826 II) * C/1826 P1 (a.k.a. 1826 IV) * C/1826 U1 (a.k.a. 1826 V) * C/1826 Y1 (a.k.a. 1827 I) * C/1827 P1 (a.k.a. 1827 III) Comet Pons may also be a partial reference to: * Comet Nicollet-Pons, C/1821 B1 * 12P/Pons-Brooks (a.k.a. 12P/1812 O1, 12P/1883 R1, 1884 I, 1883b, 12P/1953 M1, 1954 VII, 1953c) * 273P/Pons-Gambart (a.k.a. 273P/1827 M1, 1827 II, 273P/2012 V4) * 7P/Pons-Winnecke (a.k.a. 7P/1819 L1, 1819 III, 7P/1858 E1, 1858 II, 7P/1869 G1, 1869 I, 1869a, 1875 I, 1875b, 1886 VI, 1886d, 1892 IV, 1892c, 1898 II, 1898a, 1909 II, 1909d, 1915 III, 1915b, 1921 III, 1921b, 1927 VII, 1927c, 1933 II, 1933b, 1939 V, 1939c, 1945 IV, 1945a, 1951 VI, 1951c, 1964 I, 1964b, 1970 VIII, 1970b, 1976 XIV, 1976f, 1983 IV, 1983b, 1989 VIII, 1989g) ;Note The comets are named after the prolific early 19th-century astronomer Jean-Louis Pons, who worked at Marseilles Observatory, Lucca, and Florence observatories.

Hebrew Bible, published by Thomas Dobson in Philadelphia, 1814 source: Library of Congress ==Dobson's Encyclopaedia== The 18-volume third edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica began to be published in 1788 in Scotland, and was well received. It was by far the best edition of the Britannica to date, and remained so until roughly the 7th edition. (See History of the Encyclopædia Britannica for more details.) The third edition was completed in 1797, with a two-volume supplement added in 1801. In this era, enterprising American printers were matching their British counterparts in quality and quantity, and severely undercutting them in price as well. A successful master printer, Dobson objected to a perceived British bias in the Britannica and resolved to re-edit the Britannica to be more fair. He completed his \\"Encyclopedia\\" in April 1798, a year after the original. He also added a supplement of three volumes in 1803. Dobson's encyclopædia had 16,650 pages with 595 engraved copperplates; both numbers are slightly greater than their British counterparts. In support of Dobson's patriotic initiative, then- President George Washington subscribed to two sets of his first American encyclopædia, one of which now rests with most of the rest of George Washington's personal library in the Boston Athenæum. ==Other publications== Dobson also published the first secular music composed by an American, namely, Seven Songs for Harpsichord by Francis Hopkinson. Dobson also contributed to the development of American Unitarianism. ==Family life== Dobson married Jean Paton on 5 October 1777 in New Grayfriars Parish in Scotland. They had three daughters in Scotland: Margaret (born 15 February 1779), Alison (born 6 October 1780) and Catharine (born 15 November 1782). The family moved to the United States in 1783 or 1784; by 1785, Dobson had a thriving printing business in Philadelphia. In 1822, Dobson retired from book-selling due to old age and ill health. He died the following year. ==References== * * Category:Encyclopædia Britannica Category:1751 births Category:1823 deaths Category:American encyclopedists ","title":"Thomas Dobson (printer)"},{"id":"9073139","text":"The FIS Alpine World Ski Championships 1989 were held February 2–12 in the United States at Vail, Colorado.de.wikipedia.org Alpine Skiweltmeisterschaft 1989 Outside of the Winter Olympics of 1960 and 1980, the alpine world championships returned to the U.S. for the first time since 1950, which were also in Colorado at Aspen.

The founder, Arthur McKenzie was a wholesale confectioner from West Kensington. Herbert Mansfield became company secretary soon after and acquired the company outright in 1933. Lavells successfully survived the war years in spite of the difficulty of rationing. In 1948 it became a publicly quoted company and was subsequently acquired by Callard & Bowser, who in turn were acquired by Arthur Guinness & Company Limited in 1951. ==Guinness & Expansion== The company then entered an era of rapid expansion and acquired many more shops including newsagents. These acquisitions were chains of shops and warehouses operated by Hancock & Co. in Manchester and Gordon's Limited in Leeds. This expansion firmly established Lavells in the news agency field and also involved them in the operation of sub-post offices. ==Morison Son & Jones== It was at this time, that the company was opening prime High Street units and responsibility for the chain passed to the Guinness subsidiary Morison Son & Jones. The management were keen to set up a chain of departmental stores to complement their newsagents. As a result, a new fascia was developed under the name 'Morison's Department Stores'. Morison's opened branches in the North, Midlands and Dover, Kent. The Dover branch was opened on Friday 19 November 1976 by Arthur Brough from TVs 'Are You Being Served'. In 1977, Lavells and the pharmacy shops of Guinness were set up as a new company, Guinness Retail Holdings Limited (GRH) and all Morison's were re-branded 'Lavells for Leisure'. The surplus floor space at the Dover branch was converted into a training centre for Lavells branch managers, and run by Mrs M Michie. ==Martin the Newsagent plc== The chain was going from strength-to-strength and in 1984 GRH purchased the much larger Martin the Newsagent plc. Prior to the take-over of Martin, Lavells had 1,215 members of staff in 114 branches and 885 delivery staff. ==John Menzies== In 1987, 66 of the largest Martin and Lavells stores were sold to rival retailer John Menzies and all of the smaller stores were converted to use the Martin fascia. ==WHSmith== In the 1990s, John Menzies Retail was purchased by WHSmith, and as a result many WHSmith units were once Lavells. ==Lavells House== The headquarters was at Lavells House, Hockliffe Street, Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire, LU7 1JF. Although the company left the building many years ago, the building still bears the name 'Lavells House'. ==Logo== The most famous logo consisted of a 3D cube made up of the letters L A V E L L S. This was followed by the 'for leisure' strap-line. The carrier bags simply read 'Lavells Multiple Retailers'. In the late 1970s, a London advertising agency developed the brown and green stripe logo which was used until the Martin merger.

Bernier (born May 22, 1959) is an American meteorologist, serving as the Cleveland-based WJW-TV's weekday evening meteorologist. He won two Emmy awards for his weathercasts and has been at the station since February 1988, when Cleveland's very first full-length local morning newscast began. After nearly twenty years on weekday mornings, Bernier moved to the weekday prime- time on May 28, 2007. ==Early years== His interest in meteorology began at the age of 4 when he noticed dark clouds from an approaching storm. It was the beginning of an all-consuming passion to understand weather of all types, but during his boyhood years in New England took a particular fancy to winter snowstorms and the well-known \\"nor'easter.\\" At the age of 16, Bernier became a fixture in New Bedford radio by beginning his broadcast career supplying weekend weather forecasts to his hometown radio station, WBSM-AM. With the patient help of a number of mentors such as WBSM's Stann Lipp, Jim Loomis, Dick Stevens and newsman Jim Phillips (who is still heard on WBSM), he polished his skills as a broadcaster while continuing to educate himself in synoptic meteorology (forecasting) by shadowing the late Charlie Taylor, meteorologist for WLNE-TV, whose studios still resided in New Bedford in the 1970s. ==Education== After graduating from New Bedford High School in 1977, he attended Lyndon State College in Lyndonville, Vermont, and graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Meteorology in 1981. During his college years, he started a student-run company called \\"The New England Weather Net,\\" which supplied local radio stations (including WSTJ-AM, St. Johnsbury, Vermont) with daily weather feeds by phone. ==Career== After graduation, he left New England to accept his first position as weekend meteorologist in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, at eastern Iowa's then premiere station, KGAN (which was known as WMT-AM-FM- TV). After only eight months, Bernier left Iowa to join the then speculative national cable channel start-up known as The Weather Channel. Bernier and Bruce Kalinowski (Edwards) were the very first on-camera meteorology team when The Weather Channel started broadcasting on Sunday, May 2, 1982, at 8:00 PM EDT. In 1985, he moved to Minneapolis where he worked at WWTC-AM (the only commercial AM radio station in the U.S. to attempt an all-weather format), Northwest Airlines (as a trans-Atlantic flight forecaster) and eventually KARE-TV, Minneapolis, where he worked with his wife, Sally (née Patrick) during the weekday morning newscasts. In 1988, Bernier and his family moved to Cleveland, where in the same year he began work at WJW channel 8, serving as the morning meteorologist until 2007, when he moved to evenings.http://fox8.com/author/fox8andrebernier ==Other interests== In addition to his activities as a television meteorologist, his faith journey began to take an increasing priority which led him to enroll in a distance- education seminary program. With completed courses from Southern Baptist Seminary in Nashville and ICU University, now known as Global University in Springfield, Missouri, he was ordained by an Ordination Council of Pastors on May 21, 2004, at Grace Community Church, Massillon, Ohio. He is an active member of Faith Family Church, North Canton, OH. He occasionally accepts invitations to other local pulpits as guest preacher and evangelist, and has served as interim pastor at churches in Massillon in 2012 and most recently in Chesterland, OH. He is also active in digital film production, having been mentored by Hollywood film director, Jason Tomaric. Aside from a number of shorts, Bernier's filmography includes the mid-feature-length drama, \\"Christmas Lights In Pilaf\\" (2004) based on the first chapter of his Christian novel, \\"Welcome To Pilaf,\\" and most recently a full-length documentary about a family from France who, with their life savings, bought an old, abandoned building in Olmsted Falls, Ohio, to open an authentic French bistro. \\"French Toast\\" (2006) has been submitted to numerous film festivals in the United States, including Utah, DC, Cleveland, and Dallas, as well as the national Telly Awards. He has also authored several books including a faith-based Christmas novel series, \\"Christmas In Pilaf\\", and an autobiographical timeline, \\"The Extra Mile.\\" A proponent for energy conservation and renewable fuel technology including the deployment of a hydrogen vehicle, he is also noted for his opposition to the theory of anthropic causes of climate change. ==Awards and honors== *AMS Seal of Approval (#286) *Two-time Lower Great Lakes Emmy Awards recipient ==References== ==External links== * Lyndon State College alumni web site. * Washington, Julie; The Plain Dealer.

Tormé is best known for his work with Gillan, as well as his brief stints with Ozzy Osbourne's backing band and Atomic Rooster. ==Early career== The Ranelagh-born Tormé was inspired by the likes of Jimi Hendrix, Jeff Beck, Rory Gallagher, and Gary Moore. He formed his first band at a young age. His first paid performance came when Don Harris, a 14-year-old drummer he played alongside when he was 17, secured a gig at the local Girl Guides' dance in Kilmainham in Dublin.\\"Ten questions with Bernie Tormé\\". Retrieved 24 January 2007. Tormé then played in Dublin band The Urge in the early 1970s before relocating to London in 1974, where he initially played with heavy rockers Scrapyard, whose bass player, John McCoy would later be re-united with Tormé in Gillan. Inspired by England's burgeoning mid-1970s punk rock scene, Tormé formed the Bernie Tormé Band in 1976. With this group, Tormé toured with successful groups of that period such as The Boomtown Rats and Billy Idol's Generation X, among many others. Tormé later revealed that his band secured the supporting slot with the Boomtown Rats by agreeing to go around London putting up posters advertising the tour.\\"Bernie Tormé interview\\". Retrieved 24 January 2007. In 1977 the band were asked to contribute two tracks to the Live at the Vortex album, \\"Streetfighter\\" and \\"Living for Kicks\\". This led to them being signed to the Jet Records label, who \\"...paid us forty quid a week each for the next 18 months... Apart from that they just sat on us pretty much, they were more into ELO.\\" ==Gillan and Ozzy Osbourne== Frustrated by a lack of commercial success, Tormé accepted the invitation of former Deep Purple vocalist Ian Gillan in 1979 to join his band Gillan. Over the next four years, Gillan enjoyed three Top Ten UK albums (Mr. Universe, Glory Road, and Future Shock), in addition to extensive worldwide tours of Europe, Japan, and the United States. In 1981 Tormé left Gillan, citing frustration over a lack of money despite the success the band was seeing. He was replaced by guitarist Janick Gers. He played as a live session man for Atomic Rooster and was hired in March 1982 by Jet Records to replace the recently deceased Randy Rhoads in Ozzy Osbourne's band. Tormé flew from England to Los Angeles with the promise that the job was his, even being paid an advance by Jet before leaving England. Though Osbourne had already settled on Robert Sarzo to replace Rhoads, he was forced to abide by the record company's decision and Tormé began rehearsing with the band. After only a handful of shows it became apparent that Tormé's bluesy style was not a good match for Osbourne's brand of heavy metal, and he elected to return to England to continue work on a solo album.Sarzo, Rudy (2017). Off the Rails (third edition). CreateSpace Publishing. He was quickly replaced by Brad Gillis and the tour continued. ==Later career== Beginning in 1982 Tormé led his own band under various names and lineups (including a version of Torme with singer Phil Lewis, formerly of Girl and later with LA Guns). Tormé spent several years with the band Desperado with former Twisted Sister singer Dee Snider. Although the record saw limited release, Snider re-used a number of the songs for a subsequent project, Widowmaker (not to be confused with the 1970s English band of the same name). Tormé also played guitar on René Berg's solo album, The Leather, The Loneliness And Your Dark Eyes, released in 1992. In addition to the continued release of new Tormé recordings and re-issuance of his back catalogue titles, Tormé also became involved with the 'Silver' project, which also included former Michael Schenker Group vocalist Gary Barden. In 2006, Tormé announced the formation of Guy McCoy Tormé (aka \\"G.M.T\\"), with former Gillan bassist John McCoy and drummer Robin Guy. In 2007, Tormé contributed lead guitar and sitar parts to \\"Smile in Denial\\", track No. 4 of Yoni, a solo album from Wildhearts frontman Ginger. Bernie successfully released 4 albums via the Pledgemusic platform between 2014 and 2018, and his last album 'Shadowland', featuring drummer Mik Gaffney (The Last Resort) and Sy Morton on bass was released in November 2018, followed by the 'Final Fling' UK tour starting on 22 November. Unfortunately Pledgemusic did not honour their outstanding payments to Bernie Tormé on his last release. Tormé also ran his own record label, Retrowrek Records, and recording studios, Barnroom Studios in Kent. ==Personal life== In February 2019, it was reported that Tormé was \\"extremely ill with virulent double pneumonia\\". He died on 17 March 2019, a day before he would have turned 67. He is survived by his wife Lisa Valder, and their children Jimi, Eric and Tuli, and his sister, Cliodna Murphy ==DiscographySolo=== *Bernie Tormé Band ― Live at the Vortex Vol.1 (2 tracks contributed to compilation) (1977) *Bernie Tormé Band ― \\"I'm Not Ready\\" (7\\") (1978) *Bernie Tormé Band ― Bernie Tormé Band (EP) \\"Weekend\\"/\\"Secret Service\\"/\\"All Night\\"/\\"Instant Impact\\" with Phil Spalding and Mark Harrison (1979) *Bernie Tormé And The Electric Gypsies ― Turn Out The Lights (1982) – UK No. 50 *Bernie Tormé And The Electric Gypsies ― Electric Gypsies (1983) *Tormé - Back To Babylon (1986, With Phil Lewis) *Tormé - Die Pretty, Die Young (1987, With Phil Lewis) *Tormé – Demolition Ball (1993, With ex-Samson singer Gary Owen) *Bernie Tormé – Wild Irish (1997, A project with Anti- Nowhere League members Chris Jones and John Pearce) *Bernie Tormé – White Trash Guitar (1999, A project with Anti-Nowhere League members Chris Jones and John Pearce) *Bernie Tormé Band ― Punk Or What (recordings from 1976 to 1978 unreleased until 1999) *Bernie Tormé – Flowers & Dirt (2014) *Bernie Tormé – Blackheart (2015) *Bernie Tormé – Dublin Cowboy (2017) *Bernie Tormé – Shadowland (2018) Live albums *Bernie Tormé – Live (1984) *Tormé – Official Live Bootleg (1997) *Bernie Tormé And The Electric Gypsies ― Scorched Earth Live 1999–2000 (2001) *Bernie Tormé – Live in Sheffield 1983 (2002) ===With Gillan=== *Mr. Universe (1979) *Glory Road (1980) *Future Shock (1981) *Double Trouble (1981) *The Gillan Tapes Vol. 1 (1997) *The Gillan Tapes Vol. 2 (1999) *The Gillan Tapes Vol. 3 (2000) *Triple Trouble (2009) (Recorded live 1981/1982) ===With Atomic Rooster=== *Headline News (1983) *Live in Germany 1983 (released 2000) ===With Desperado=== *Demo I + III (Demo) (1990) *Bloodied But Unbowed (1996) *Ace (2006) ===With René Berg=== *The Leather, The Loneliness And Your Dark Eyes (1992) ===With Silver (band fronted by Gary Barden)=== *Silver (2001) *Dream Machines (2002) *Intruder (2003) ===With GMT=== *Cannonball (2006, EP) *Bitter And Twisted (2006) *Evil Twin (2008) *Raw – Live (2011) ==References== ==External links== *Bernie Tormé official website *Rock N Roll Universe Interview 2007 * Interview at Skylight Webzine *Photo galleries of Bernie live (GMT and The Electric Gypsies) Category:2019 deaths Category:Irish rock guitarists Category:Irish male guitarists Category:Tormé members Category:The Ozzy Osbourne Band members Category:1952 births Category:Atomic Rooster members Category:Samson (band) members Category:Gillan (band) members Category:Musicians from Dublin (city) Category:Deaths from pneumonia Category:Quatermass (band) members ","title":"Bernie Tormé"},{"id":"9073311","text":"Rafael Vargas-Suarez (born 1972), more commonly known as Vargas-Suarez Universal, is a contemporary artist living and working in Brooklyn, New York.

The book remained in the top 15 places on the New York Times Best Seller list for \\"Hardcover Advice\\" books from 9 December 2007 to 13 January 2008. ==Background== The title \\"General Ignorance\\", chosen both to emulate and parody general knowledge quizzes, was first used to describe the final round of the panel game QI, which was created by Lloyd and had Mitchinson as head researcher. Appearing initially in the unbroadcast pilot (subsequently available on DVD), the round has varied little in content and style since, although the questions became slightly more obtuse. From the start the round consisted of several deliberately misleading questions which appear to have obvious answers that are actually inaccurate (for example, aircraft black boxes are in fact orange, for visibility.) The pilot also introduced the concept of penalising answers that were overly predictable, especially obvious jokes: one such question in the pilot was, \\"What is the sixth most popular name for a baby boy in Germany?\\" The answer to the question is, in fact, \\"Tim\\". However, QI's regular panellist Alan Davies answered with the jokey suggestion \\"Adolph\\", allowing host Stephen Fry to produce a prepared piece of card reading \\"Adolph,\\" whereupon the obvious-but-inaccurate answer was revealed to carry a penalty score of −10 points. When the pilot was shown to the then-controller of BBC Two (Jane Root), it was this feature that particularly caught her attention, and penalties remained a regular feature throughout the first nine series of the programme.QI Series 1 DVD Factoids Due to the nature of the questions in the final round, however, the majority of penalties would always be awarded during \\"General Ignorance\\". While most episodes are structured around a theme topic beginning with the Series' initial letter (each Series is alphabetically structured, with Series 5 being \\"E\\", etc.), \\"General Ignorance\\" contains questions on a range of diverse subjects, linked only by common misunderstanding. Occasionally the round differs, in particular during the Christmas specials. During the course of the \\"B\\" Series special, Fry and Davies swapped places for \\"General Ignorance\\", with Fry attempting to answer questions ostensibly written by Davies to stump him. During \\"D\\"s Christmas Special, all the \\"GI\\" questions revolved around saints. ==Structure== The Book of General Ignorance contains a list of 230 questions, most of which previously appeared in episodes of QI. Each question explains the correct answer, and usually attempts to show why people tend to make the wrong assumptions, or believe certain myths. Each book contains two forewords, one by Fry, the other by Davies. Davies' initial \\"foreword\\" was credited as \\"Four words,\\" which read simply: \\"Will this do, Stephen?\\" ==Critical reception== An earlier version of the cover, playing on the idea of ignorance with a typo Response to the book has been mostly positive, both critically and commercially. Critic Jennifer Kay said, \\"The Book of General Ignorance won't make you feel dumb. It's really a call to be more curious.\\" Liesl Schillinger in The New York Times praised the book for gathering \\"so much repeatable wisdom […] in one place,\\" asking the rhetorical question of interested parties—\\"In the Information Age, can you afford to remain ignorant of these precious factoids?\\" Doug Brown reviewed the book for Powell's Books, noting that it has a \\"UK-heavy emphasis\\", and that \\"Overall The Book of General Ignorance is a lot of fun, and you're guaranteed to learn something you didn't know (but thought you did).\\"Powell's Books \\"Review-a-Day\\" .

In fact, a bit smart-arse.\\" She also noted that \\"It's a disgrace that in a book of this kind there is no index. It's not possible to look up a subject about which you are ignorant\\". Marcus Berkmann drew attention to the over-abundance of similarly themed books (to which the QI title—and series—clearly owe a certain debt), commenting that: > A book of the show has become all but necessary, if only to allow us to > ingest this information at normal brain speed, and because such fine and > creative research genuinely deserves to be captured in print.

Berkman's complaints, however, are countered by his admission that \\"this book is already the amusing trivia success of the season,\\" containing many \\"eye- watering\\" and \\"eyebrow-raising\\" facts, even if he thinks it a little smug. Both the \\"question and answer\\" format and indexing issues were addressed for the follow-up The Book of Animal Ignorance, which had an alphabetised structure (with contents page), and stand-alone facts, rather than responses. ==Sequels== A \\"Pocket edition\\" of The Book of General Ignorance was published on 3 April 2008.

The villa is situated on a hill surrounded by olive groves at Bagheria, near Palermo in Sicily. As all the Villas in Bagheria, it was built as a country house, and was traditionally used by the family only during the spring and autumn. While considered a national monument, it remains a private residence. ==History== The house was first conceived by Don Barbaro Arezzo who employed in 1783 the architect Giovanni Emanuele Incardona to design his country house, the result - Villa Spedalotto was built between 1784 and 1793. The architect had been a student of Giuseppe Venanzio Marvuglia, one of Sicily's promoters of Neoclassicism. In 1790, while still under construction, the house was purchased by Don Onofrio Emanuele Paternò di Raddusa, Baron of Spedalotto and Gallitano. In 1799, the villa was used to accommodate the exiled royal family of Naples Francis of Bourbon (the future King Francis I), his wife Archduchess Maria Clementina of Austria, and the daughter Maria Carolina (future Duchess of Berry). The royal family had escaped from Naples following the revolution of 1799. A tradition is that King Ferdinand II of The Two Sicilies was born in the villa on 1810, but his official historiography states he was born in the royal palace at Palermo. During the 1870s Jesuit astronomer Father Angelo Secchi S.J. was often a guest at the villa. He was a close friend to the Marquess, and used the terrace for his observations of the heavens. ==Architecture== The house, which is low, is built around an open courtyard of two wings flanking the corps de logis, at the centre of which is a large Greek revival portico giving access to the villa. The windows are ornamented by alternating pointed and segmented pediments. Architecturally, the house is notable for its neoclassical facades. Built in the late 18th century, when Sicilian Baroque was falling from favour, the house shows influences of the neo-Grecian style which in Sicily immediately followed the Baroque. The interior of the villa has rooms decorated in early-Empire style, sometimes known as Pompeian, with Baroque influences, which involved copious quantities of trompe-l'œil. At the Villa Spedalotto, the frescoes by Elia Interguglielmi are clearly inspired by some drawings of Simon Vouet, now part of the collections of Versailles. A distinguishing feature of the villa is the use of blue and white Vietri tiles, which cover the broad terrace looking towards the sea.

It took place on 12–15 July 1774 in Kazan, Russia, and the surrounding area. The first stage began in the morning of 12 July, when rebels under Yemelyan Pugachev defeated government troops and besieged them in the Kazan Kremlin. During the battle some government forces defected to the rebels' side. However, in the evening, tsarist forces under Johann Michelson reached Kazan and defeated the rebels in two battles which took place on 13 and 15 July, forcing Pugachev to retreat to Tsaryovokokshaysk and then to cross the Volga. Out of 25,000 and 15,000 rebels who participated in the first and last stages of the battle respectively, only 500 escaped. К. Амиров. Казань: где эта улица, где этот дом, Казань, 1995., стр 214–220 ==Prelude to the battle== Kazan was threatened by Pugachev as early as the autumn of 1773. Many of the town's nobles escaped to Moscow, inspiring fear there. A defensive plan was formulated by the Russian high command and was approved personally by Catherine the Great. ===Kazan's defenders=== There were 3 sectors of defense in Kazan. The first, under general Banner, extended from Kazanka and Arsk Field to Qaban lakes. There, government troops were reinforced by gymnasium pupils under headmaster Kanitsa and armed town militiamen. The second was from the Pleteni to Yamskoy quarter under general-mayor Larionov, and the third was from Yamskoy to Kazanka, under colonel Svechin. The area north from the citadel was defended by Admiralty troops under Shchelin. The citadel itself was reinforced and the garrison under Letskoy was ready to fight. Zilantov Monastery and the Admiralty were turned into strongholds, redoubts were installed at Kazanka's bank and Arsk Field, and a system of knife-rests was installed around the city. Nine cannons were placed behind the knife-rests. The suburban settlements were left to defend themselves without government assistance. There were 1,500 regular troops in Kazan, along with policemen, Admiralty troops and firemen the defenders numbered 2,000. On 2 July the governor von Brandt announced a coming siege. ===Rebels=== Ten mullahs sent by Catherine's officers to agitate against Pugachev were killed by rebels. The Orthodox bishop Veniamin appealed to Christians to refuse from joining Pugachev army. However, many peasants from the entire region of modern Tatarstan joined the rebellion and marched to Kazan. On 10 and 11 July Pugachev's troops encamped to the north-east of Kazan, between Troitskaya Noksa and Tsaritsyno. The army numbered 25,000, mostly Cossacks supported by Tatar and Udmurt peasants and Bashkir cavalry. Only the Cossacks had firearms; the Bashkirs were armed with bows while the peasants were mostly equipped with clubs and stakes. On 11 July, Pugachev, with an interpreter, approached Kazan borders and demanded that the loyalist forces surrender. The Tatar community was invited to support the rebellion. Von Brandt refused to disarm; however, the Tatars quarters sent seventy emissaries with presents to Pugachev. They also disclosed weaknesses in the Kazan defense. On 12 July, at four o'clock in the morning, Pugachev convened a council of war, dividing his army into 4 groups. The first two under Beloborodov and Mineyev should attack Arsk Field, the main group under Pugachev himself attacked Sukonny (Broadcloth Manufactory) quarter. The group under Ovchinnikov and Bakhmutov should attack Tatar quarters. The storm started at six o'clock after Pugachev's prayer. ==BattleStorm of Kazan=== Beloborodov took Neyelova grove, the area of modern-day Gorky Park and approached the citadel by the avenue now known as Karl Marx Street. Pugachev's cannons neutralized government artillery and shelled the defenders of the cloth factory under manufacturer Dryablov. Workers joined the rebel army. The fourth group of rebels reached Mokry quarter and Admiralty. Government troops were forced to retreat and were besieged in the citadel. Nearly half of the defenders, mostly ethnic Tatars, defected to the rebels. The central stone part of Kazan, mostly settled by Russian nobles and merchants, was set on fire. Sukonny and Tatar quarters, however, stayed safe. Pugachev ordered his troops to safeguard the lives of civilians and captives. They were convoyed to the nearby village of Savinovo, where Pugachev invited them to join his troops. Among others, a captive Lutheran priest was appointed colonel in Pugachev's army, but nobles and resisters were massacred. ===Pugachev's family=== Pugachev's family, his wife Sofia Dmitrievna, his 11-year-old son Trofim, daughters Khristina and Agrafena and his brother, were imprisoned in Kazan during the rebellion. Sofia Pugacheva should confirm, that Yemelyan isn't Peter III, but a Cossack. She could visit markets to spread this information. When Pugachev's group marched they occasionally met his family. Trofim called him, but Pugachev said that he is simply a friend of this family. So, he took them to unit transport.Some other sources say that they were liberated from prison along with other prisoners История Татарской АССР, Казань 1980 ===Michelson's arrival=== The Kremlin surrounded, rebel cannons were installed near Spasskaya Tower and started shelling. After noon, Pugachev stopped the storm and retreated to Arsk Field. There he participated in thanksgiving service. Then he had a dinner at Tatar merchant Musa Apanayev's house. In the evening governmental troops from Ufa under Johann Michelson reached Kazan. A harsh battle took place at the modern Gogol street,or Tsaritsyno village, История Татарской АССР, Казань 1980 but neither side won. Pugachev retreated to Savinovo and Sukhaya Reka villages. On 13 July he tried to prevent the end of the siege of the citadel, but under the pressure of Michelson and Potyomkin the rebels were defeated and were forced to retreat. On 15 July Pugachyov's army of 15,000 was defeated in the battle of Arsk Field. Pugachev with 500 men escaped to Tsaryovokokshaysk, to cross the Volga on 18 July and to continue his struggle then. Michelson didn't follow him, as government forces had no horses. Before the trial captives were imprisoned in a camp near the suburb of Bishbalta. In autumn two gallows were placed in Kazan, one in Sukonny, another in Tatar quarter. Many captive rebels were executed, including Beloborodov and Mineyev. ==Aftermath== After Pugachev's escape some rebel groups under Bäxtiär Qanqayıv and Usman Timerev continued the resistance, but they were shortly neutralized by governmental troops. The battle of Kazan had a significant role in Tatarstan's history. The Tatar participation in the rebellion numbered up to 85,000. Nevertheless, the participants of the rebellion were harshly punished. The Tsar's government continued its policy of the support of Muslim nobility and clergy, to prevent similar uprisings as a result of religious oppression in the future. Feudal oppression, however, stayed for a long time. This battle took a major place in the Soviet culture. The first Tatar movie Bulat-Batır was devoted to Pugachev rebellion in Tatarstan and the siege of Kazan. ==See also== *Pugachov's oak ==References and footnotes== Category:History of Tatarstan Kazan Category:History of Kazan Category:Conflicts in 1774 Category:18th-century military history of the Russian Empire Category:1774 in the Russian Empire ","title":"Battle of Kazan (1774)"},{"id":"9073371","text":"This is a list of the mayors of Girona, Spain from 1814. *Marià Berga (1814) *Narcís de Foixà (1814-1820) *Francesc de Delàs (1820-1821) *Francesc de Camps i Font (1821-1822) *Josep Antoni de Ferrer (1822-1823) *Valentí Comas (1823-1836) *Joan Danís (1836) *Narcís de Camps (1836-1838) *Narcís Germen (1838) *Marià Camps i de Niubò (1838) *Baldiri Simon (1838-1839) *Francesc Camps i Roger (1839-1840) *Antoni Martí i Serra (1840) *Francesc Camps i Roger (1840) *Marià Camps i de Niubò (1840-1841) *Narcís Sicars (1841) *Joan Urgell (1841-1842) *Joan Martell Domènech (1842) *Tomàs Narcís Blanch (1842) *Ramon Contreras (1842) *Joan Martell Domènech (1842-1843) *Marquès de la Torre (1843-1844) *Josep de Caramany (1844-1846) *Ventura Mercader (1846-1854) *Josep Coll (1854) *Joan Balari (1854-1856) *Marià Hernández (1856-1862) *Joaquim Rigau (1862-1863) *Ignasi Bassols (1863-1866) *Pere Viñas (1866-1867) *Joaquim de Cors i Guinart (1867-1868) *Francesc López Martínez (Corregidor) (1868) *Pere Barragán i García (Progressist) (1868-1869) *Joaquim Massaguer i Vidal (Progressist) (1869-1872) *Pere Barragán i García (Liberal) (1872-1873) *Joaquim Riera i Bertran (Federal) (1873) *Narcís Farró i Albert (Federal) (1873) *Josep Prats i Font (Federal) (1873) *Ignasi Bassols i de Rovira (1873-1874) *Pere Gahit i Vié (1874-1875) *Marià de Camps i de Feliu (1875-1877) *Josep Mollera i Calvet (1877-1880) *Pere Grahit i Vié (1880-1881) *Martí Coll i Lliura (1881-1882) *Joan Romaní i Miguel (1882-1883) *Francesc de P.

Cape Adare was an important landing site and base camp during early Antarctic exploration. Off the coast to the northeast are the Adare Seamounts and the Adare Trough. ==History== Captain James Ross discovered Cape Adare in January 1841 and named it after his friend the Viscount Adare (the title is derived from Adare, Ireland). In January 1895, Norwegian explorers Henrik Bull and Carsten Borchgrevink from the ship Antarctic landed at Cape Adare as the first documented landing on Antarctica, collecting geological specimens. Borchgrevink returned to the cape leading his own expedition in 1899 and erected two huts, the first human structures built in Antarctica. The expedition members overwintered and the survivors were picked up in January 1900. This was the first expedition party ever to winter over on the Antarctic continent. Zoologist Nicolai Hanson died during the winter and was buried at Cape Adare. The closest research station in modern times was Hallett Station, the joint New Zealand/United States station at Cape Hallett, 63 miles (101 km) to the south. This base was in use from 1957 to 1973. The Australian Bicentennial Antarctic Expedition set out from Cape Adare for their successful assault on Mount Minto in 1988. The expedition's support vessel was moored to the ice shelf in the bay and maintained radio contact with the climbers during their ascent. In February 2007, the Japanese whaling ship Nisshin Maru experienced a fire below decks while in the Ross Sea. The vessel drifted without power for days until its engines were repaired, raising concern due to its proximity to Cape Adare. ===Historic sites and monuments=== The first buildings erected by Carsten Borchgrevink at Cape Adare were prefabricated of pine by the Norwegian factory Strømmen Trævarefabrikk. These huts are still standing, and the site is recognized internationally as a significant historic site. Members of the Northern Party of Scott's Terra Nova Expedition over- wintered at Cape Adare in 1911 and 1912. They erected one hut, which has fallen into ruin today. As a result of initiatives by the Antarctic Heritage Trust the site (with the buildings) is registered in the Antarctic Treaty System as an Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA 159) the highest level of protection available under the terms of the Treaty.Historic Sites of the Antarctic The remains of two Borchgrevink's Hut, as well as those of the Terra Nova Expedition's hut, have also been designated a Historic Site or Monument (HSM 22), following a proposal by New Zealand and the United Kingdom to the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting. The grave of Nicolai Hanson has been similarly but separately designated (HSM 23). ==Climate== Studies suggests that Cape Adare was covered in ice during the Last glacial period, and deglaciated around 16.2 thousand years ago. And the results suggest that it took several thousand years until penguin colonies formed, after ice free surfaces became available. ==Iceberg Interactions== Submarine shoals on the narrow continental shelf to the east of Cape Adare are the site of unusually frequent submarine collisions with large current-mobilized icebergs transiting northward out of the Ross Sea. Notably, this process led to the sudden breakup of Iceberg B15 in October 2007, as well as a number of other large icebergs. These collisions are energetic enough to be recorded by seismographs in Antarctica and the southern Pacific Ocean region.Martin, S., Drucker, R., Aster, R., Davey. F., Okal E., Scambos T., and MacAyeal, D., Kinematic and seismic analysis of giant tabular iceberg breakup at Cape Adare, Antarctica, J. Geophys. Res., 115, B06311, doi:10.1029/2009JB006700, 2010 ==Adélie penguins== Cape Adare is the site of the largest Adélie penguin rookery in the world. The only study of this particular colony was done by George Murray Levick, who was a member of the 1910–13 Scott Antarctic Expedition and observed it for an entire breeding cycle in 1911 and 1912. He was reluctant to publish it due to the unusual mating habits of penguins that he recorded, among them homosexuality, sexual and physical abuse of chicks, and mating with dead female penguins, nowadays ascribed to the lack of experience of young penguins. He described it as \\"depraved\\". The report was considered too shocking for public release at the time, and was suppressed. The only copies that were made available privately to researchers were translated into Greek, to prevent this knowledge becoming more widely known. After it became lost, it was rediscovered and published in the journal Polar Record only in 2012. The discovery significantly illuminates the behaviour of the species that some researchers believe to be an indicator of climate change. In 1901, Carsten Borchgrevink, part of the British Antarctic Expedition 1898–1900, published the book, First on the Antarctic continent. He wrote ca 1900, in the chapter dedicated to Adélie penguins: Adélie-penguin-Cape-Verde-1899-Carsten- Borchgrevink-groups.jpg Adélie-penguin-Cape-Adare-Nests-colony1899-Carsten- Borchgrevink-groups.jpgAdélie penguin colony, at their nests ==References== Adare, Cape Category:Borchgrevink Coast Category:Pennell Coast Category:Antarctic Specially Protected Areas Category:Seabird colonies Category:Historic Sites and Monuments of Antarctica ","title":"Cape Adare"},{"id":"9073410","text":"KKXS (96.1 FM, \\"XS Sports 96.1\\") is a commercial radio station licensed in Shingletown, California, broadcasting to the Shasta & Tehama County areas.

His mother was Henrietta Elizabeth Williams-Wynn, daughter of Sir Watkin Williams- Wynn, 4th Baronet, and Charlotte Grenville, and a granddaughter of Prime Minister George Grenville. Lord Delamere was an indirect descendant of Sir Robert Walpole, the first Prime Minister of Great Britain.Hayden, Joseph. (1851). The book of dignities, pp. 527, 565. In 1848, Cholmondeley married Lady Sarah Hay-Drummond, daughter of Thomas Hay-Drummond, 11th Earl of Kinnoull; and the couple were childless when she died in 1859. He married again in 1860, this time to Augusta Emily Seymour, daughter of Sir George Hamilton Seymour. The children of that marriage were: * Hugh Cholmondeley, 3rd Baron Delamere (28 April 1870 – 13 November 1931); married, firstly, Lady Florence Cole, daughter of Lowry Cole, 4th Earl of Enniskillen, and Charlotte Baird, in 1899; had issue. He married, secondly, in 1928, Gwladys Beckett, who later became the second female Mayor of Nairobi. * Hon.

Lady Delamere died in 1911. She had survived her husband for 24 years. ==Career== Cholmondeley was elected to Parliament for Denbighshire as a Tory in 1840, a seat he held until 1841, and then represented Montgomery from 1841 to 1847. In 1855, Cholmondeley was called to the House of Lords when he succeeded his father as second Baron Delamere. ==Lands and estates== In this period, Baron Delamere and his family were inextricable from the history of Cheshire and married into the Hibbert Family of Birtles Hall,Cheshire who had made their fortune in Jamaica. The family seat was at Vale Royal Abbey.Holland, G.D et al. (1977).

He was undefeated in a racing career of seven starts and was voted the best British-trained two-year-old of the 20th century according to the National Horseracing Museum. He did not race after 1913 and was retired to stud where he became an influential sire. ==Breeding== Foaled at Straffan Station Stud, near Ardclough, in County Kildare in Ireland, he was sired by Roi Herode (France) out of Vahren. His damsire (Bona Vista) was by Bend Or The Tetrarch's five-generation pedigree and race record. Retrieved February 17, 2011. (after whom Bend-Or spots are named). The Tetrarch was a gangly and less-than-attractive colt whose grey coat was sprinkled with white blotches. Dismissed as having no racing potential by some buyers, he was ultimately sold by his breeder to Major Dermot McCalmont and placed under the care of trainer Atty Persse. ==Racing record and legacy== Sent to the track as a two-year-old, under jockey Steve Donoghue The Tetrarch easily defeated his competition. Quickly dubbed the \\"Spotted Wonder,\\" he easily won all seven of his 1913 starts. In his one real test he came from behind to capture the National Breeders' Produce Stakes by a neck, but that one close finish only resulted after a mix-up at the start that left him four or five lengths back. An injury in October 1913 ended The Tetrarch's two-year-old racing campaign. The following spring he reinjured himself in training. His handlers were hoping he would heal sufficiently to return to racing, but by the end of 1914 came to the conclusion that he would never race again. There is (as with many star two-year-olds) the question of what The Tetrarch's – and his competition's – continued physical development would have meant to his racing performance at age three. In 1913 The Tetrarch easily beat all comers including Stornoway, who won several races that year; among them were the Gimcrack and Norfolk Stakes (now The Flying Childers Stakes). However (as noted in the Thoroughbred Heritage website), none of The Tetrarch's races were more than six furlongs (¾ mile) and because he never raced at age three, he was not tested at standard mile to mile-and-a-half distances. His bloodlines, though, pointed to stamina. Thoroughbred Heritage – The Tetrarch. Retrieved February 17, 2011. It is also noted that the 1913 crop of two-year-olds was less than spectacular, and the 1914 Champion Stakes, Ascot Gold Cup and the three British Classic Races for colts were all won by different horses with less-than-distinguished career records. The question of The Tetrarch's ability at longer distances is a legitimate one. His successful son Tetratema lost at seven furlongs and won one race at eight furlongs (one mile); of his twelve other wins, all were at five to six furlongs. The Tetrarch's speedy daughter Mumtaz Mahal won five important sprint races at age two but at age three was beaten at her first tries at longer distances. In two one mile races, she finished second in the 1,000 Guineas and was fifth in the Coronation Stakes. Mumtaz Mahal's handlers then limited her to competing only in sprint races and she won the six-furlong King George Stakes and the five-furlong Nunthorpe Stakes. While on the other hand his son (Salmon-Trout) was not only a good juvenile racing at five to seven furlongs but would maintain racing form well into his three old season, winning The Princess of Wales's Stakes (a 12-furlong race) and the St. Leger Stakes (a 14-plus-furlong race). The Tetrarch is also produced two other St. Leger Stakes winners (Polemarch and Caligula), which would indicate that the birth of Salmon-Trout was not just a fluke. Some of his progeny were great sprinters and stayed that way, while others went on to mature into very well- rounded distance champions. The abilities of The Tetrarch’s progeny ranged so wildly that it is difficult to tell whether or not he would have filled out as a three-year-old by looking at his offspring alone. Lauded for his greatness on the track by racing personalities and fans of the day, many appraisals of The Tetrarch decades after his death have been equally glowing. The United Kingdom's National Horseracing Museum called The Tetrarch a \\"phenomenon\\" and report that he was voted Britain's two-year-old of his century. National Horseracing Museum Online - The Tetrarch. Retrieved February 17, 2011. In their description of the colt, the National Sporting Library's Thoroughbred Heritage website in the United States calls The Tetrarch \\"probably the greatest two-year-old of all time\\" and \\"possibly the greatest runner ever\\". ==Stud record== In 1915 he was sent to Thomastown Stud in County Kilkenny, Ireland, and later moved to his owner's Ballylinch Stud just east of Thomastown. The Tetrarch had difficulty as a stallion due to a lack of interest, and would be plagued by infertility problems for a number of years. Although he sired only 130 foals throughout his stud career his progeny inherited his blazing speed, and in 1919 he was the leading sire in Great Britain & Ireland as a result of the performances of Tetratema and the filly Snow Maiden. Another daughter (Mumtaz Mahal) won a number of important sprint races and, according to \\"Thoroughbred Heritage\\" went on to become one of the most important broodmares of the 20th century. Mumatz Mahal became an important ancestress in the pedigrees of some of history's most influential sire lines, including Nasrullah, Royal Charger, Tudor Minstrel and Mahmoud. Nasrullah sired Bold Ruler, the sire of the Seattle Slew/A.P. Indy modern stallion lines. Bold Ruler is possibly most famous for producing Secretariat, renowned for his stamina and also an influential broodmare sire. Nasrullah also produced the lines leading to Red God (1954), Grey Sovereign (1956) and Never Bend (1960). The Tetrarch also sired Paola (who won the 1923 Coronation Stakes) and The Satrap (champion two-year-old of 1926). As for questions regarding The Tetrarch's potential to win at a distance, three sons won the St. Leger Stakes (the longest classic) – Caligula (1920), Polemarch (1921) and Salmon-Trout (1924).Sire Lines by Abram S Hewit: updated version copyright 2006 Blood Horse The Tetrarch died at Ballylinch Stud on 8 August 1935 at the age of twenty-four, and is buried there in the farm's equine cemetery. == Pedigree == The Tetrarch is inbred 4 × 4 to Speculum, Doncaster and Rouge Rose, meaning both horses appear twice in the fourth generation of his pedigree. ==See also== * Flying Childers Stakes * List of leading Thoroughbred racehorses * Steve Donoghue ==References== ==External links== * The Tetrarch's pedigree and racing stats * The Tetrarch at Thoroughbred Heritage * The Tetrarch's profile at the United Kingdom's National Horseracing Museum Category:1911 racehorse births Category:1935 racehorse deaths Category:British Champion Thoroughbred Sires Category:Racehorses bred in Ireland Category:Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom Category:Undefeated racehorses Category:Thoroughbred family 2-o Category:Byerley Turk sire line Category:Chefs-de-Race ","title":"The Tetrarch"},{"id":"9073537","text":"Fortuna Berlin (Berliner Fussball Club Fortuna 1894 ) was a German association football club established on 1 November 1894 in Berlin out of the memberships of the clubs Semnonia Berlin and Berliner FC Hercynia.

Like print references, reference software can either be general or specific to a domain, and often includes maps and illustrations, as well as bibliography and statistics. Reference software may include multimedia content including animations, audio, and video, which further illustrate a concept. Well designed reference software improves upon the navigability of print references, through the use of search functionality and hyperlinks. ==Origins and development== Many dictionaries and encyclopedias rushed into CD-ROM editions soon after the widespread introduction of the CD-ROM to home computers. A second major development occurred as the internet also became widely available in homes, with reference works becoming available online as well. The conversion of previously print-only reference materials to electronic format marked a major change to the marketing and accessibility of such works. A striking case study is that of the venerable Encyclopædia Britannica, which was previously only available at prices of USD 1500 and higher, restricting it to the better libraries and the wealthy. Today, the Encyclopædia Britannica and World Book Encyclopedia retail in electronic format for around 50 USD, with cheaper OEM versions sometimes bundled with new computers. Such dramatic changes brought conventionally restricted knowledge repositories to the fingertips of an almost universal audience in a period of less than 11 years. The opportunities brought by new media enticed new competitors into the reference software market. One of the earliest and most well-known was Microsoft Encarta, first introduced on CD-ROM and then also moving online along with other major reference works. In the dictionaries market, one of the more prolific brands was Merriam-Webster, which released CD-ROM and then online versions of English dictionaries, thesauri and foreign language dictionaries. Since 2010, reference materials have begun to appear as apps on Smartphones. In the field of English as a foreign or second language, this is seen as an interesting pedagogical development and is the subject of much discussion , as language learners increasingly abandon print dictionaries for online editions and apps like the one produced by Macmillan Education. A list of online dictionaries is maintained under \\"dictionaries\\". Wikipedia and its offspins (such as Wiktionary) marked a new departure in educational reference software. Previous encyclopedias and dictionaries had compiled their contents on the basis of invited and closed teams of specialists.

Davison was born in Smethwick, but grew up in Sheffield. He had a number of short-term jobs before completing an apprenticeship in iron founding, and joining the Friendly Society of Iron Founders (FSIF). He also studied at night school and qualified as a sanitary inspector.Trades Union Congress, \\"Obituary: J. E. Davison\\", Annual Report of the 1927 Trades Union Congress, p.263 Davison became increasingly prominent in the FSIF, becoming chairman of its executive, then its full-time national organiser. During World War I, he served on advisory councils for the Ministry of Munitions and the Board of Trade. At the 1918 general election, he was elected as MP for the new Smethwick constituency on the outskirts of Birmingham. It was an unusual electoral contest: there was no Conservative Party or Liberal Party candidate, and his only opponent was Christabel Pankhurst of the Women's Party, who was supported by the alliance of the Conservative Party and the David Lloyd George-led Coalition Liberal faction. Davison won the seat with a majority of only 775 votes, and was returned to the House of Commons at the 1922 general election with a margin of only 382 votes over his only opponent, a Conservative.

They were produced by Joe Horne, who later worked for the Disney Channel and on the Cartoon Network show Class of 3000. Horne later produced two new series in flash animation for the Internet in 2004, and again in 2010, and produced a traditionally animated series for the Internet in 2019, the 2010 and 2019 series appear on Horne's YouTube channel. ==Overview== The setting is New York City in the near future. The title characters work for a well-meaning shadow agency called \\"DADDIO\\" (which seems to be a play on the similar organization in The Man from U.N.C.L.E.). Stevie Washington is a young, white male in his early twenties with black hair, sunglasses, black tee shirt, jeans, and sneakers. He is rarely seen without his red, white, and blue skateboard. (In the later 2004 flash episodes, Stevie wears goggles and a hoodie that obscures his features.) Zoya (no last name given) wears a red jumpsuit with a black belt, collar, gloves, stilletto-heeled boots, and a large hair bow that rather resembles a Playboy bunny's rabbit ears. She is armed with the unlikeliest of weapons: a yo-yo. She uses it to swing from lamp posts or buildings a la Spider-Man, and to disarm enemies—on one occasion to defuse a bomb (by knocking off the fuse). Stevie and Zoya attempt to stop the nefarious plots of various supervillains, including The Outlaws from Planet X, The Minutewomen, the voodoo priestess Mamuwaldi, The Disco Zombies, and—most of all—the disfigured, evil industrialist and publisher of The Trash Times John Warlok. The early series was crudely scored (mostly with a pastiche of old movie and television music) and more crudely animated. Zoya spoke in only two episodes, and Stevie in only one, with a single word: \\"Framed!\\" The series was quickly paced, contributing to its cult status. Narration was supplied by actor Russell Johnson.Stranger Still: Stevie Washington, The Angry Youth Occasionally, mistakes by Johnson or the other voice actors were left in, giving the cartoon an improvisational feel. ==Opening narration== Each episode begins with the following narration (punctuation as in original): Stevie Washington, the angry youth.

It was probably the largest producer of rubber and vinyl toys in the world, though Norway's Tomte Laerdal, Finland's Plasto, and Sweden's Galanite were major European producers. ==History== The Double Fabric Tire Company was started in Auburn, Indiana, in 1913. At the outset, Double Fabric made tires for the Auburn Automobile Company. In the 1920s, the name was changed to the Auburn Rubber Company. It phased out its production of tires and introduced new products such as rubber sheets used to sole shoes. In 1935, it began making rubber toys, including a variety of toy cars, trucks, tractors and animals. Most vehicles were four to eight inches in length and cast in a variety of colors. During World War II, the company continued to make soles – now for combat boots – and also gaskets for so-called \\"jerry cans.\\" ==Vehicles== Toys were made in many different styles, models and sizes. Proportion and detail were fairly good for vinyl toys. Probably the most famous were the four inch variety. Some of the model selections were clever and well done (for rubber) such as a 1955 Thunderbird, a Triumph TR-2, 1955 Mercedes-Benz 300SL, a 1957 Ford Ranchero, and perhaps the most famous Auburn Rubber offering, a neat Ford Model A-style Hot Rod. One sports car appeared to be a cross between a Cunningham and an Aston Martin (see photo). One convertible's fins and dagmar bullets looked mainly like a Cadillac. Another odd sedan had fins like a Pontiac, a front grille like a Kaiser Traveller, with the general shape of a forward-look Chrysler. Utility and service vehicles in the small size were also popular such as a fire engine, a telephone truck with two ladders on top (it looked like a Dodge), and a flat bed truck. Police cars (molded in blue) and fire chief cars (molded in red) appeared to be variations on 1955 Chevrolets. What appeared to be a policeman on a Triumph single cylinder motorcycle also was popular, and there was also a Harley three-wheeler. One of the more clever vehicles was a boy molded in a waving position on a tricycle. Models were simply constructed, typically only 7 parts: the body, four wheels, and two metal axles with flared tips to keep the wheels in place. The wheels were a slightly harder vinyl and were usually molded in either black or yellow. One popular coloring feature was the application of sprayed on silver coatings for the windows, grilles, bumpers, and other highlighted areas. Peoples' faces in bas relief style would often be molded into the windows of the cars – and often separate views were seen from the driver's side to the passenger side. Entire torsos were often molded into the open interiors of convertibles or roadsters. Similar to other plastic or vinyl vehicles of the era, the toys were often shipped and sold with many vehicles clumped together in a single box – so the buyer could walk away with the vehicle of his choice – cars and trucks were not sold in their own individual packages. Cars and trucks were also molded in larger sizes, from about five inches up to about ten inches or so. These appeared both as cars and trucks / utility vehicles. Larger cars included an Indianapolis style open wheel racer (see photo), a 1957 Cadillac Eldorado convertible, a less realistic Cadillac-style 'station wagon', and also a 1955 Plymouth station wagon airport limousine with nine different people molded into the windows (see photo). Utility vehicles produced were a detailed fire truck, a variety of tractors and farm implements, a road grader and other construction vehicles, an articulated cab and stake bed truck. Tanks and airplanes were a staple, and many other more fantastic creations were also produced. ==Other Toys== In a more traditional vein, an antique style wagon with horses was also offered. Toy soldiers, cowboys, trees, farm animals, farm buildings, and even farm implements were also molded in a variety of colors, initially in rubber and later in plastic. A life-sized horseshoe game (as they were rubber, they didn't do as much damage when one was hit in the head) was labeled as Auburn \\"safe play\\" toys. ==Company Directions== The toy company was sold in 1959 and dies were moved to Deming, New Mexico, in a transaction described by author Jonathan Kwitny (1979) in his book, Vicious Circles: The Mafia in the Marketplace, as an example of the penetration of a legitimate business by organized crime. The former plant in Auburn was eventually acquired by Cooper Tire & Rubber Company and is now used by Cooper Standard Automotive. Auburn Rubber in Deming went out of business in 1969, and its toy cars could be found in retail stores through the early 1970s. The Deming toys are probably the Auburn Rubber products most often seen for sale at flea markets or on eBay today. ==References== Kwitny, Jonathan. 1979.

Along with this emphasis on record-keeping, the Moravians maintained active communication with other Moravian centers in Europe and throughout the world. This dedication to sharing and receiving information continues today through the worldwide Moravian Unity, including Africa and the Caribbean. Along with their rich devotional life and their missionary fervor, the Moravians maintained their high regard for education and their love of music as an essential part of life. Moravian composers – also serving as teachers, pastors, and church administrators – were well versed in the European Classical tradition of music, and wrote thousands of anthems, solo arias, duets, and the like for their worship services, for voices accompanied not only by organ but also by string orchestras supplemented by woodwinds and brasses. In addition, these musicians copied thousands of works by the best- known and loved European composers of their day – Carl Stamitz, Haydn, Carl Friedrich Abel, Adalbert Gyrowetz, Mozart, the Bach family, and many whose names have descended into relative obscurity. This rich collection of music manuscripts and early imprints comprises nearly 10,000 manuscripts and printed works, with some works appearing in several individual collections. The collections originating in North Carolina are housed in the Moravian Music Foundation headquarters in Winston-Salem, NC; those originating in Moravian centers in Pennsylvania and Ohio are housed in the Moravian Archives, Northern Province in Bethlehem, PA. The musical life in the Moravian settlements was rich and became respected by many in the young country. This musical life included sacred vocal music for worship services, including, of course, hymns; brass ensembles, especially trombones, serving specific sociological and liturgical functions; and instrumental ensemble music for recreation, ranging from works for unaccompanied solo instrument to symphonies and large oratorios. A musicologist who knows nothing of the Moravian Church or of its theology and life in the 18th and 19th centuries can analyze and certainly appreciate Moravian music. However, the more one knows of the Moravian Church, its life and worship, the more adequate and helpful is the appreciation and understanding of the music. Nearly all of the sacred vocal music written by Moravian composers was for use in worship services. Because of the Moravian penchant for recording the crucial factors in their lives, and for preserving these records in their archives, there is ample means of knowing in depth the context in which the early Moravian composers lived, wrote, and performed. In the thought of Zinzendorf, and of the Moravians of his time, all life was seen as “liturgical”. That is, every aspect of life, even the most mundane, was a sort of worship to be offered to God, after the example of Christ himself. For this reason, such normally “secular” matters as beginning a new business or reaping the fields had a religious connotation. To give this ideal of life concrete expression and to nurture the soul of those who would live it, practical realities naturally led to the development of various worship services and devotions which gave the Moravian communities a character of their own. Each day began and ended with worship, both in smaller groups within the community (divided by age and condition of life) and with the community as a whole. A significant addition to Moravian worship materials was made with the introduction of the Losungen, or Daily Texts, in 1728. This could be a private devotional, but it assumed corporate congregational importance as well. From the time of the first printed Text Book (1731), Moravians throughout the world have used these texts as a daily devotional guide, either in private devotions or in the brief morning or evening services for the whole congregation or a specific part of it. While the 18th century Losungen were generally drawn from Scripture texts, they might also consist of a hymn stanza or a portion thereof. This was characteristic of the Moravian Church, for it was in its hymnody and music that it expressed its theology most frequently and visibly. Zinzendorf encouraged the development of hymn singing. In the early days of Herrnhut, when the community did not yet enjoy a large repertoire of hymns, he conducted singing classes in which not only the hymns, but something of the life and purpose of the author was learned. A large hymnal was produced in 1735 and many more texts were added in its numerous appendices. A slightly more manageable collection was made in 1754 and 1767. In 1778 there appeared the extremely influential hymnbook of Christian Gregor, which remained in use among the German-speaking congregations for about a century. This contained 1750 hymns, 308 of them written or recast by Gregor himself. Gregor’s procedure in compiling these hymns is also instructive: he often took familiar stanzas from originally different hymns and put them together into one hymn, sometimes weaving them together with new stanzas of his own. In 1784, Gregor edited a Choralbuch which contained the most-frequently-used tunes for these hymns. In this book he cleaned up and added to a tune numbering system developed earlier in the century – a system by which tunes of the same meter share a number and are distinguished from one another by a letter. For instance, all the “tune 22s” are long-meter tunes with 8 syllables in each of their four lines. Tunes with the same number are interchangeable with regard to their meter, although the selection of which particular tune to use with which text is a choice requiring care and experience. The church bands still use this system today, with tunes called by number rather than name. Gregor’s procedure of recombining and adding to the stanzas of hymns may sound a bit unusual. In fact, that is a very Moravian thing to do, and indeed this sort of approach, which combined new and old hymn stanzas in creative ways, was central to that most characteristic of Moravian services, the Singstunde. In a Singstunde, the person in charge selects with care individual stanzas from various hymns in such a manner that they will develop some Christian truth or theme as the singing progresses. In the 18th century, the congregation, which possessed an unusual command of the hymnal, would fall in with the leader before he reached the end of the first line of each stanza, singing by heart. No address was given on such occasions as none was needed. And even now, the first-line index to the Moravian Book of Worship includes first lines of all stanzas, not just the first. ==Categories of Moravian music== When a member of the church dies, it is announced by the trombone choir from the belfry of the church. While the funeral service is being held in the church, the body of the deceased lies in the Corpse House at the rear of the church. After the service, the coffin is placed on a bier and covered with a white cloth, as it is borne to the cemetery. At the grave a responsive service, participated in by the minister and the people, and with trombone accompaniment, is rendered. See also aequales. A four-trombone choir plays by torchlight on Easter Day, to announce the Easter sunrise service in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. The richest body of Moravian music is that composed for worship. However, there are other aspects of the musical life of the American Moravians which should not be overlooked. First is what is most likely the best known aspect of Moravian music: the trombone choirs. Moravians have used brass ensembles and bands since their earliest years in Herrnhut to announce special events and to accompany singing at outdoor services and funerals. The Easter Band for the sunrise service in Salem numbers some 500 band members representing the 12 congregations of the Salem Congregation (the Moravian churches in Winston-Salem, NC) as well as players from across the country. Moravian chorales used by the trombone choirs and church bands tend to be fairly stately and to have active parts for all four voices, which reflects the singing of a congregation – also singing in parts. The second type of music is the secular instrumental music in the Moravian collections. This includes some music by Moravian composers, but by far the greater part of the instrumental music is not by Moravians, instead by composers who were the most popular ones in Europe in the middle 18th century and later. Moravians seemed to have a voracious appetite for new music and collected, purchased, and copied everything they could get their hands on. American Moravian music collections contain several thousand pieces by composers as well known as Haydn, Johann Christoph Friedrich Bach, Karl Stamitz; and as little known as Wenzel Pichl, Adalbert Gyrowetz, and Kleinknecht. What the Moravians have in their instrumental collections is a cross-section of the musical culture out of which the masters arose – the cultural sea in which Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven were swimming. Many of these works in the American Moravian collections are “only known surviving” copies of music from these composers. Moravian contributions to the instrumental works, while fairly few in number, are significant. An example is David Moritz Michael’s “Water Journey” for woodwind sextet, which was written for a holiday outing along the Lehigh River in Bethlehem, PA. Musicians played on a barge and floated down the river while the townspeople strolled along the bank. There are also string works by Moravian composers. John Antes (1740–1811) wrote a set of three string trios, which are lovely and challenging and have been recorded. These trios were published in England prior to 1795 under the name “Giovanni A-T-S, Dillettante Americano”. They are the earliest known chamber music written by a composer born in America. Antes was born in Pennsylvania and served the Moravian Church as a missionary in Egypt. In addition to the trios we have, he also wrote some string quartets which are now missing. The truly international scope of the Moravian Church can be seen in the story of these quartets: here was an American-born missionary in Egypt, sending copies of his string quartets to an American diplomat in France, quartets which he had written for an English nobleman and his associates in India. His three trios were dedicated to the Swedish ambassador in Constantinople. These trios have been published by the Moravian Music Foundation in a scholarly edition. Also by a Moravian composer are the six string quintets (two violins, two violas, and cello) by Johann Friedrich Peter. These were written in Salem, NC in 1789. Peter was probably the most gifted and accomplished Moravian composer. In addition to these string quintets, he wrote nearly 100 vocal works. \\"Secular\\" groups—chamber ensembles and concert bands—developed along a parallel stream to the \\"trombone choirs\\". While the trombone choirs and church bands focus their attention primarily on chorales, the community bands and chamber ensembles play primarily what we would now call \\"secular\\" music -- chamber music, marches, dances, arrangements of popular music of various sorts. These groups provide not only entertainment for player and audience alike but also enable the players to improve through playing more challenging music. By the 1780s the Bethlehem Collegium musicum was playing the music of the best composers of the day—Bach's sons, Hasse, Stamitz, Haydn, and many others, now lesser known. Other Collegia musica were founded -- Lititz (c.1765), Nazareth (c. 1780), and Salem (c.1786) -- the latter continuing on until about 1835. The increasing demand for music by these groups stimulated the American Moravians to a veritable frenzy of copying and transcribing from European masterworks as well as composing their own works. The Salem Collegium musicum collection holds about 500 compositions, of which about 150 are in manuscript form. String music is prevalent in all of the instrumental music collections, with genres ranging from works for unaccompanied violin through classical symphonies. The final aspect and the “heart and soul” of Moravian music is the sacred vocal music. This was music specifically written for worship services. Moravians wrote thousands of anthems, solos, and duets for voices accompanied by chamber orchestra – a rarity in colonial America. In 1783, Moravians in Salem held the first celebration of July 4 in the country with a challenging music program assembled by Johann Friedrich Peter. This work was titled the Psalm of Joy. ==Characteristics of Moravian vocal music== *They are based upon biblical or hymn texts, often the Daily Text assigned for the day of the first presentation of the work. *The voice parts tend to move all together so that the words can be understood rather than any imitative writing such as Bach would do. In this way the Moravians resemble Handel more than Bach. *They often have elaborate instrumental introductions and interludes, but the instrumental parts provide support when the voices are singing rather than drawing attention away from the text. *Thus they are straightforward, well- crafted works like other Moravian arts and crafts. ==The American Moravian music collections== These include: * Manuscript and printed orders of service from the 18th century forward *Manuscript and printed instructional books in music *Sacred music: hundreds of manuscript anthems, vocal duets, and vocal solos, dating from the 19th and early 19th centuries, mostly written by Moravians in an early-Classical style with accompaniment by chamber orchestra *Hymnals dating from the 16th century to the present in languages ranging from English and German to Afrikaans and Czech *Instrumental music: hundreds of manuscript and printed works ranging in size from solo sonatas to symphonies by a wide range of European composers, some of which are the only known surviving copies (such as the Symphony in E Major by JCF Bach) *Bound collections of sheet music dating from the mid-19th century forward, including a piano exercises book containing the first printing of the Star Spangled Banner, one of only nine surviving copies *Music books and some correspondence of the band of the 26th NC Regiment from the Civil War, which are particularly instructive about the battle of Gettysburg, the siege of Petersburg, and the road to Appomattox. There is a complete set of band books (all parts) from the 26th NC Regimental Band as well as individual part books believed to be from the 21st and 33rd NC Regimental Bands. *A growing collection of music written by living, contemporary American Moravian composers ==The Moravian Music Foundation== Moravian sacred vocal music was used in Moravian worship in America through the early part of the 19th century. With the gradual change from German to English services however, the musicians found that it was often easier to write a new work in English that it was to translate one from German to English and make it “singable”. As the American Moravians became more “American”, their old style music fell out of favor. Because of the penchant of Moravians to carefully keep their old stuff, the music was not discarded completely. Instead it was packed away in boxes, envelopes, and even a cracker barrel. Nearly a century later in the 1940s, scholars began to ask questions about this old music. As cataloging and research efforts were undertaken, scholars found that there was a great deal of this music and that much of it was of high quality. The first “Early American Moravian Music Festival” was held in Bethlehem, PA in 1950 and was conducted by Dr. Thor Johnson. The success of that experience led to another festival in 1954 and another in 1955. Recognizing the amount of hard work involved simply in preparing music for these Festivals, a group of clergy and laymen worked together to organize the Moravian Music Foundation in 1956 to do just that. Choir and Orchestra of the 2006 Moravian Music Festival in Columbus, OH The Moravian Music Foundation’s mission is to preserve, share, and celebrate the musical culture of Moravians. It is an independent 501(c)(3) non profit, tax-exempt corporation with two offices: the headquarters in Winston-Salem, NC and an office and archives in Bethlehem, PA. There are four staff members, as well as part-time contract staff hired as needed for special projects as funding permits. The Moravian Music Foundation is governed by a Board of Trustees, of whom twelve are appointed by the Moravian Church in America and its constituent bodies, and from nine to sixteen are elected by the Board of Trustees itself. The operations of the Moravian Music Foundation are largely funded by individual contributions, with some support garnered from sales and royalties revenue, grants for special projects, and annual support from the Moravian Church in America. The Foundation is custodian and curator of the music collections of the Moravian Church in America. Contracts between the constituent bodies of the Moravian Church and the Moravian Music Foundation empower the Foundation to edit, publish, record, and otherwise disseminate this music. The Foundation has overseen the publication of over 400 works with some two million copies in circulation worldwide. These published works contain a brief historical introduction to the Moravian musical culture. Forty-four orchestra works from American Moravian collections have been edited and placed in the Fleisher Collection of the Philadelphia Free Library and are thus available for loan to orchestras around the world. The Foundation continues to produce scholarly musical editions for study and performance, and has begun a series of “simplified arrangements” of Moravian vocal works intended for smaller choirs. The Moravian Music Foundation is involved in a long-term project to produce high quality recordings of the works of the major American Moravian composers (beginning with the works of Johann Friedrich Peter, David Moritz Michael, John Antes, and Johannes Herbst). A working relationship has been established with New World Records, the producers of the Recorded Anthology of American Music. Under this agreement, the Foundation produces scholarly editions of the works to be recorded, arranges for the recordings, and oversees the production of detailed historical liner notes with each recording. The Foundation is also the custodian of several privately owned collections, and has received some important collections from other than Moravian sources. The largest of these is the collection of musical Americana donated by Irving Lowens. This collection contains some 2,000 volumes including American hymnals and psalm books from the 18th and 19th centuries. While neither Moravian in content nor in origin, the Lowens Collection is an extremely valuable resource for hymnological study, both in music and texts. The Moravian Music Foundation manages music lending libraries of three types: sacred choral anthems; instrumental parts to edited and published Moravian anthems; and edited instrumental works from the Moravian collections. With each loan, information is available regarding Moravian history and culture, composer biographies, and the context in which the music was written and used. To support research into the musical holdings, the Foundation’s Winston-Salem headquarters houses the Peter Memorial Library, a research collection of some 6,000 volumes specializing in Protestant church music and American music history. This library (while not a circulating collection) is open to the public. The Foundation provides research guidance for graduate degree studies; most recently completely and ongoing doctoral studies involve candidates from Catholic University, Cincinnati Conservatory, New York University, and Temple University. The Foundation also produces its own research. The Moravian Music Foundation provides programming consultation for over a dozen professional music groups worldwide, as well as for college and community special events.. The Foundation also serves as music director for the regular Moravian Music Festivals presented by the Moravian Church. These festivals occur every three to five years, alternating between the Northern and Southern Provinces of the Moravian Church in America, and attract some 300 people from around the world. Festivals include concerts, seminars, and workshops. Newly edited pieces from the Moravian collections are showcased during Festival concerts. The Foundation publishes a quarterly Newsletter; monographs on specific topics; catalogs of its collections in book form; the Companion to the Moravian Book of Worship; and several editions of sheet music edited from the Moravian collections. It also self produces CDs in addition to those produced by New World Records. The Moravian Music Foundation works with two resident mixed- voice choral groups, the Moramus Chorale based in Winston-Salem, NC and the Unitas Chorale based in the Lehigh Valley area of Pennsylvania. These groups share Moravian vocal music by performing regularly in their local communities. Occasionally they employ instrumental ensembles to accompany them and to perform some of the many instrumental pieces found in the Moravian collections. In addition to the Moramus and Unitas Chorales, the Moravian Music Foundation has provided music and programming support to Moravian College in Bethlehem, PA; North Carolina School of the Arts; Magnolia Baroque Festival; Rollins College in Winter Park, FL; the American Brass Quintet; and Carolina Pro Musica, as well as to various Moravian and other denomination churches, community ensembles, and other professional groups. ==Conclusion== For the Moravians, music has always been seen as a necessity of life, not as a luxury. Moravians have always used their music to express their faith, to communicate their faith, and to enjoy each other’s company, and continue to do so today. The musical heritage of the Moravians is a living tradition that is still evolving. The Moravian tradition of the trombone choir continues today with trombone choirs in various Moravian communities and in the church bands active in most Moravian congregations. The tradition of secular instrumental music continues in the Moravian church centers of North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Ohio through various community music ensembles. The sacred music tradition continues as well, both in preserving and sharing the old music and in writing new. ==Recordings== *Lost Music of Early America. Music of the Moravians.

The initial installation was rather makeshift but, realising its potential, Southern decided to acquire the vessel for further development. The boat was thoroughly overhauled to house a complete and unique outside broadcast facility and, following this work, was renamed Southerner. ==Configuration== The Proud class was assigned to refurbished motor torpedo boat vessels originally manufactured by the British Power Boat Company during the Second World War. The Winola had been upgraded with gas turbine engines by the Marine Turbo Craft company, who had owned the craft before it was bought by Southern Television. In adapting the Southerner, forward bulkheads were removed to accommodate a 350 kg video recorder and other equipment, all of which could be installed and removed by crane for relatively easy turnaround. Two 4.5 inch image orthicon cameras were installed at the sides of the front deck while a third was mounted on top of the cabin for an all-round view. The cabin also housed the production control room. The craft was over 70 ft long and displaced over 50 tons but was nonetheless quite fast with a top speed of over 40 knots. ==Productions== Southerner had the ability to transmit live pictures back to shore and also to record video for subsequent editing. The maritime tradition of the South coast of England (Southern Television's reception area) provided many opportunities to use the craft, which was used to cover Cowes Week and the Fastnet race as well as one-off boating and water skiing events. Additionally, Southerner was notably used to produce the sea-themed children's drama, Freewheelers, and A Tale of Two Rivers, a musical programme recorded on the rivers Seine and Thames to contrast the cities of Paris and London. Sometimes, the vessel was even used to provide a live feed to the entire ITV network. One such occasion was June 4, 1968 when Sir Alec Rose arrived at Portsmouth following his single-handed voyage around the world. The event was due to be covered by the London ITV contractor Rediffusion but it pulled out when one of its engineers was fatally injured during preparation. ==Later use== The vessel, or at least a substantial part of the hull, was known to be operating as the pleasure boat Ambra in Malta up until the summer of 2005, after which it fell into disuse. In 2007 it was deemed uneconomic to refurbish and was broken up. ==References== ==External links== * British Military Powerboat Trust - discussion of the motor torpedo boat class and photos, including one of the former Southerner later known as Ambra * Historical Television Website - Contains a small picture of Southerner in its outside broadcast configuration Category:ITV (TV network) Category:Motorboats Category:Motor torpedo boats of the Royal Navy ","title":"Southerner (marine vessel)"},{"id":"9073754","text":"Upn or UPN may refer to: __NOTOC__ ==Television== * UPN, a defunct American television network * UPN Kids (1995–1999), an American children's programming block ==Education== * National Pedagogic University (Mexico) (Spanish: Universidad Pedagógica Nacional), Mexico City, Mexico * Private University of the North (Spanish: Universidad Privada del Norte), Trujillo, Peru * University of Pembangunan Nasional Veteran, Surabaya, Indonesia ==Politics== * Navarrese People's Union (Spanish: Unión del Pueblo Navarro), a political party in Spain * Nigerien Progressive Union (French: Union progressiste nigérienne), a former political party in Niger * Unity Party of Nigeria, a now-defunct political party from the Nigerian Second Republic ==Other uses== * Unique Pupil Number, held in the National Pupil Database in the U.K. * Universal Product Number, a subset of the UPC barcode used for medical products * Universal Principal Name, an object in Subject Alternative Name extension in X.509 certificate * UPN (notation) or Reverse Polish notation, a mathematical notation in which operators follow their operands * Upn, the symbol for the chemical element unpentnilium * UP-N, the abbreviation for the Union Pacific / North Line, a Metra line in the Chicago metropolitan area * Uruapan International Airport (IATA: UPN), Uruapan, Michoacán, Mexico *Ústav pamäti národa, National Memory Institute of Slovakia ","title":"UPN (disambiguation)"},{"id":"9073781","text":"Benedito Nunes (November 21, 1929 - February 27, 2011) was a Brazilian philosopher and literary critic.

PHF is also known as Shasta River Crud and Equine Monocytic Ehrlichiosis. It was first described in areas surrounding the Potomac River northwest of Washington, D.C., in the 1980s, but cases have been described in many other parts of the United States, such as Minnesota, California, and Pennsylvania. Currently, it is found in more than 40 U.S. states and Canada.Pascoa, Elaine. \\"PHF Prevention.\\" Practical Horseman July 2008: 60-66. ==Cause== The causative agent of PHF is Neorickettsia risticii (formerly Ehrlichia risticii), an intracellular rickettsial bacterium. ==Transmission== Accidental ingestion of the mayfly is thought to be one of the main modes of transmission of PHF. The vector of Neorickettsia risticii is believed to be a trematode (fluke). The life cycle of the fluke takes it through freshwater snails and back into water, where it is ingested by the larval stages of several aquatic insects, including caddis flies and mayflies. It is thought that the main mode of infection is by accidental ingestion of infected adult insects, who may fly into barns and die in stalls or on pastures after enclosure. Experimental infection has been produced with oral administration of infected insects and subcutaneous inoculation of N. risticii. All attempts to transmit the disease using ticks have failed. Several outbreaks of PHF have been found to coincide with mass emergences of burrowing mayflies of the genus Hexagenia; these insects hatch en masse and may be found littering the ground in nearby stables, where they are attracted by light. The entire natural history and life cycle of N. risticii has yet to be elucidated, but bats and birds may be wild reservoirs of infection. Unlike other causes of acute colitis in horses, such as Salmonella and Clostridium, PHF is not spread directly from horse to horse. ==Signs and symptoms== Signs and symptoms of PHF include acute-onset fever, depression (sometimes profound), inappetence, mild colic-like symptoms, decreased manure production, profuse watery non-fetid diarrhea endotoxemia, edema due to protein imbalances, abortion by pregnant mares, and acute laminitis (20 to 40 percent of cases). Infected horses founder usually within three days of the initial symptoms, thought to be secondary to endotoxemia. Death may occur and is usually due to severe laminitis leading to founder. Horses may not always display any other symptoms beyond a fever. ==Diagnosis== Diagnosis of PHF is accomplished by measuring antibody titers or PCR testing to look for the bacterium in the blood and feces. However, most veterinarians opt to initiate treatment right away, as the disease can progress quite quickly. Veterinarians may also run complete blood counts and chemistry and electrolyte panels to determine the course of care. Radiographs may be taken to track the progress of laminitic horses. ==Treatment== N. risticii responds well to tetracycline antibiotics. Mild cases may be treated with oral doxycycline, while severe cases are usually treated with intravenous oxytetracycline. Supportive care for severe cases is aimed at minimizing the effects of endotoxemia and preventing laminitis. This may include intravenous fluids and electrolytes to counteract the diarrhea; NSAIDs such as Banamine (flunixin meglumine); intravenous dimethyl sulfoxide; administration of products such as Biosponge or activated charcoal via nasogastric tube to bind endotoxins; polymyxin B or plasma for endotoxemia; supportive shoeing; low doses of intramuscular acepromazine; and pentoxifylline. ==Prevention== While a vaccine is available for PHF, it does not cover all strains of the bacterium, and recent vaccine failures seem to be on the rise. Additionally, the vaccine usually produces a very weak immune response, which may only lessen the severity of the disease rather than prevent it. The vaccine is administered twice a year, in early spring and in early summer, with the first one inoculation given before the mayflies emerge and the second administered as a booster. Some veterinarians have started making recommendations for farm management to try to prevent this disease: * Maintaining riparian barriers along bodies of water may encourage aquatic insects to stay near their places of origin * Turning off outside lights around the barn will prevent insects from being attracted * Cleaning water buckets and feed areas frequently and keeping food covered will reduce the chance that the horse will accidentally ingest infected insects ==References== Category:Horse diseases ","title":"Potomac horse fever"},{"id":"9073808","text":"The Sorne Hill Wind Farm is a wind farm located in Buncrana, Inishowen Donegal, Ireland and erected in 2006.

It searches for vacuum polarization causing nonlinear optical behavior in magnetic fields. Experiments began in 2001 at the INFN Laboratory in Legnaro (Padua, Italy) and continue today with new equipment. == Background == Nonlinear electrodynamic effects in vacuum have been predicted since the earliest days of quantum electrodynamics (QED), a few years after the discovery of positrons. One such effect is vacuum magnetic birefringence, closely connected to elastic light-by-light interaction. The effect is extremely small and has never yet been observed directly. Although today QED is a very well-tested theory, the importance of detecting light-by- light interaction remains. First, QED has always been tested in the presence of charged particles either in the initial state or the final state. No tests exist in systems with only photons. More generally, no interaction has ever been observed directly with only gauge bosons present in the initial and final states. Second, to date, the evidence for zero-point quantum fluctuations relies entirely on the observation of the Casimir effect, which applies to photons only. PVLAS deals with the fluctuations of virtual charged particle- antiparticle pairs (of any nature, including hypothetical millicharged particles) and therefore the structure of fermionic quantum vacuum: to leading order, it would be a direct detection of loop diagrams. Finally, the observation of light-by-light interaction would be an evidence of the breakdown of the superposition principle and of Maxwell's equations. One important consequence of a nonlinearity is that the velocity of light would depend on the presence or not of other electromagnetic fields. PVLAS carries out its search by looking at changes in the polarisation state of a linearly polarised laser beam after it passes through a vacuum with an intense magnetic field.The PVLAS experiment The birefringence of the vacuum in quantum electrodynamics by an external field is generally credited to Stephen L. Adler, who presented the first general derivation in Photon splitting and photon dispersion in a strong magnetic field in 1971. Experimental investigation of the photon splitting in atomic field was carried out at the ROKK-1 facility at the Budker institute in 1993-96. == Design == PVLAS uses a high-finesse Fabry-Perot optical cavity. The first setup, used until 2005, sent a linearly polarized laser beam through vacuum with 5T magnetic field from a superconducting magnet to an ellipsometer. After upgrades to avoid fringe fields, several runs were done at 2.3T and 5T, excluding a prior claim of axion detection. It was determined that an optimized optical setup was needed for discovery potential. A prototype with much improved sensitivity was tested in 2010. In 2013 the upgraded apparatus at INFN Ferrara with permanent magnets and horizontal ellipsometer was set up and began data taking in 2014 == Results == PVLAS investigated vacuum polarization induced by external magnetic fields. An observation of the rotation of light polarization by the vacuum in a magnetic field was published in 2006. Data taken with an upgraded setup excluded the previous magnetic rotation in 2008 and set limits on photon-photon scattering. An improved limit on nonlinear vacuum effects was set in 2012: Ae < 2.9·10−21 T−2 @ 95% C.L. ==See also== * DAMA/NaI * DAMA/LIBRA * CAST ==External links== * PVLAS website - Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare (INFN) – Trieste * OSQAR experiment – CERN ==References and notes== Category:Experiments for dark matter search Category:Particle experiments ","title":"PVLAS"},{"id":"9073840","text":"Pinter's People is a compilation of revue sketches or short prose works by Harold Pinter, which was performed for four weeks from 30 January 2007, at the Haymarket Theatre, in London, starring Bill Bailey, Geraldine McNulty, Sally Phillips, and Kevin Eldon.

ForDisc was forensic anthropologists' solution to this problem, and allowed for classification when some measurements are not available. == Software == ForDisc, an interactive discriminant functions program created by Stephen Ousley and Richard Jantz, is widely used by forensic anthropologists to assist in the creation of a decedent's biological profile when only parts of the cranium are available. The use of discriminant function analysis in this program allows the researcher to sort individuals into specific groups that are defined by certain criteria. In this program discriminate function analysis \\"analyzes specific groups with known membership in discrete categories such as ancestry, language, sex, tribe or ancestry, and provides a basis for the classification of new individuals with unknown group membership.\\" The program compares potential profiles to data contained in a database of skeletal measurements of modern humans.Ousley, S.D., and R.L. Jantz (2005) FORDISC 3.0: Personal Computer Forensic Discriminant Functions. University of Tennessee Using ForDisc, a decedent’s biological profile can be created based on measurements from various areas of bones, along with information about the person's age, height, race, and illnesses. For ancestry, ForDisc uses standard anthropometric measurements including maximum length, maximum breadth, bi-zygomatic breadth, orbital breadth and height, maximum alveolar breadth and width, minimum frontal breadth, basion-bregma, basion- prosthion, cranial base length, bi-auricular breadth, upper facial height and breadth, foramen magnum breadth and length, frontal chord, parietal chord, occipital chord, nasal height and breadth, bi-orbital breadth, interorbital breadth, and mastoid length. == Databases == The data behind this software largely originated from the Forensic Data Bank, which is contributed to by the University of Tennessee and other contributing institutions. The Forensic Data Bank was created in 1986, through the use of a National Institute of Justice grant, and has gathered over 3400 cases. The Forensic Data Bank is a currently ongoing effort to record information about modern populations, primarily from forensic cases. ForDisc's creators have also integrated W. W. Howells worldwide cranial data into the program, for the use of archaeological remains. Howell's craniometric data set consist of 2500 crania from 28 different populations around the world dating to the later Holocene, in which around 82 cranial measurements were obtained. == Uses == This software can estimate the sex, ancestry, and stature from a skeleton of unknown identity. This software also can be used for international hearings of war crime and investigations of human rights. This method is also used by the FBI, in different types of criminal cases.Application of Forensic Discriminant Functions to a Spanish Cranial Sample, by Douglas H. Ubelaker, Ann H. Ross, Sally M. Graver Forensic Science Communications July 2002 — Volume 4 — Number 3 Although this program was created for forensic anthropology use, many physical anthropologists are still using the program to determine the biological profile of skeletal remains that are considered archaeological in origin, but the use of this program on archaeological remains has produced misclassifications in the past. The use of William W. Howell’s craniometric data set, which is published online, has made ForDisc 2.0 more appealing to many physical anthropologists concerned with archaeological remains. == Updates == This program is continually updated. New and updated versions are created and added as more knowledge is acquired. The new features of ForDisc 2.0 are improved pictorial guide to measurements, and improved file management and printer control; a larger number of variables, including postcranial variables; larger numbers of groups, including Howells' worldwide cranial data. The newest version, ForDisc 3.0 is interactive forensic software that runs under the Windows system. ==Criticism== According to the authors of the program, some limitations should be taken into account when using this program. Some of these limitations include the fact that ForDisc will classify any unknown into the ‘closest’ group, this means that even if an individual's ethnic group or race is not represented in the database, the program will classify it to the ‘closest’ group. Another limitation involves classification using hybrid individuals and groups. The authors state that genetic exchange between groups can cause misclassifications due to gene overlap that can consist of two ancestral populations. Another limitation deal with the classification of individuals under the age of 18, this is due to the nature of physical anthropologists ability to assess age in subadults. However, the authors state that there are differences between subadults in different groups, but these differences tend to not correspond to differences seen in adults. Another limitation that the authors believe researchers should take into account is the fact that this program is based on measurements that are affected by \\"disease, disuse, treatment, or trauma.\\" The measurement of affected may produce inaccurate values, and therefore he classification will not reflect the correct population affinity.Ousley, Stephen, and Jantz, Richard. \\"Fordisc Help File, Version 1.35.\\" Mercyhurst Archaeological Institute. http://math.mercyhurst.edu/~sousley/Fordisc/Help/Fordisc3_Help.pdf The last limitation deals with archaeological populations. This limitation is because most of the measurements in the data set that the classifications are based on in the program are from remains that are from the 20th century, and should not be used for classification of archaeological remains. This is because documented population differences and secular changes that have occurred throughout history. However, the inclusion of W. W. Howells craniometric data set has allowed researchers to classify archaeological remains because much of the data set comes from individuals from the 19th century. A 2009 study found that FORDISC 3.0 \\"is only likely to be useful when an unidentified specimen is more or less complete and belongs to one of the populations represented in its reference samples\\", and even in such \\"favorable circumstances it can be expected to classify no more than 1 per cent of specimens with confidence.\\" In 2012 research was presented at the 81st Annual Meeting of the American Association of Physical Anthropologists, which concluded ForDisc ancestry determination was not always consistent, and the programs' recommended acceptance criteria did not separate correct and incorrect determinations. The authors concluded that the program does not perform to expectations and should be used with caution. == List of Contributing Institutions to the Forensic Anthropology Data Bank == * Appalachian State University * C.A.

Before their untimely demise, Ryde Sports was for many years a successful and significant club on the Isle of Wight and in Hampshire, and an important part of the town. ==History== Ryde Sports F.C. was founded in 1888 and became one of the eight founder members of the Hampshire League in 1896. Although finishing at the foot of the table in the inaugural season, the club soon improved by twice finishing runners-up, they also spent the 1898–99 season in the Southern League where they finished as runner-up in the short lived Division 2 South & West Section. The 1899-00 season was a highly successful one in which they won the Hampshire League and Hampshire Senior Cup double. After the Great War, Ryde joined the Isle of Wight League, twice being champions before returning the county fold in 1923 when they promptly won the East Division title at the first attempt. Further success soon arrived, in 1925-26 they were league champions and Hampshire Senior Cup winners the following year. The thirties continued to be very successful for the club, twice more winning County Senior Cup 1935–36 and 1938–39. The league title eluded Ryde during this period, although a top five final position was achieved each season. It was also during this period that Ryde recorded some fine runs in the FA Cup, most notably when they twice reached the 1st Round proper; in 1932–33 they lost 0-5 away v Margate, then in 1936–37, when they lost 1–5 at home to Gillingham in front of a record 5,000 crowd. They nearly made it again in 1947–48, when after navigating their way past some tough opponents they heartbreakingly lost 0-1 at home against Trowbridge Town in the final qualifying round. It was not until the 1952–53 season that the club suffered its first setback when, for the first time, they were relegated. After several years of consolidation Ryde returned as Division 2 runners-up in 1957–58, only to be relegated straight back again. Worse was to follow in 1963–64 when Ryde were relegated again to Division 3 but made a good recovery by immediately returning as champions; and in 1967–68 they finished as runners-up in Division 2, which was enough to clinch promotion back to the top flight. The seventies continued to up and down for Ryde. After two seasons in Division 1 the club was again relegated in 1969–70 and in 1976–77 again dropped down into Division 3. The early Eighties saw troubled times for Ryde, twice finishing bottom of the league and having to apply for re-election. Luckily Ryde regained its place and slowly rebuilt, and in 1986 were placed in restructured Division 2 following the formation of the Wessex League. Finally, Ryde's fortunes changed and with a powerful side the club won the Division 2 and Division 1 titles in successive seasons 1988–89 and 1989–90. For a number of years, developers had been eyeing up the clubs much loved Partlands home, and in 1990 the club vacated the premises to play at a new multi-purpose Sports Complex at Smallbrook Stadium, on the outskirts of the town. The team was elected to the Wessex League that year. During the 1990s, Ryde hosted a series of prestigious friendly matches against Premier League opposition, most noticeably Sheffield Wednesday, Aston Villa and Southampton. Ryde initially did well in the Wessex League where they were frequently in the top half of the table with its highest positions being 3rd in 1995–96 and 4th a year later. Ryde ran into financial problems and a player exodus saw the club struggle badly during the 1997–98 campaign. A local appeal for support was unsuccessful and Ryde, rock bottom of the table, withdrew from the competition in December 1997 with its playing record being expunged. ==Honours== *Southern League Division 2 South & West Section **Runners-up 1898/99 *Hampshire League Division 1 **Champions 1899/1900, 1925/26 and 1989/90 **Runners-up 1897/98, 1898/99 and 1932/33 *Hampshire League Division 2 **Champions 1988/89 **Runners-up 1957/58 and 1967/68 *Hampshire League Division 3 **Champions 1964/65 *Hampshire League East Division **Champions 1923/24 *Isle of Wight League Champions **Winners 1919/20 and 1920/21 *Hampshire FA Senior Cup Winners **Winners 1899/1900, 1903/04, 1926/27, 1936/37, 1938/39 **Finalists 1925/26 and 1935/36 *Isle of Wight Senior Cup **Winners 1926/27 and 1980/81 *Isle of Wight Gold Cup **Winners 1926/27, 1946/47, 1948/49, 1955/56, 1961/62 and 1962/63 **Finalists 1927/28, 1928/29, 1929/30, 1930/31, 1932/33, 1933/34, 1947/48, 1950/51, 1956/57, 1960/61 and 1963/64 *Portsmouth Senior Cup **Winners 1899/1900, 1900/01, 1905/06, 1919/20, 1953/54, 1966/67 and 1989/90 *FA Cup **1st Round Proper 1932/33 and 1936/37 ==Playing records League === { class=\\" collapsible collapsed\\" style=text-align:center !Season !Division !Position !Significant events -

It is known locally as the beruk. == Etymology and taxonomy == The species epithet, nemestrina, is an adjective (derived from Latin Nemestrinus, meaning \\"the god of groves\\") modified to agree in gender with the feminine generic name. M. nemestrina formerly included the northern pig-tailed, Pagai Island, and Siberut macaques as subspecies. All four are now considered separate species. == Description == M. nemestrina can reach a weight of up to for large males. This macaque has buff-brown fur, with a darker dorsal area and lighter ventral area. Its common name refers to the short tail held semi-erect, resembling the tail of a pig. M. nemestrina at Sepilok, Sabah, Malaysia == Behaviour and ecology == M. nemestrina is mainly terrestrial, but also a skilled climber. Unlike almost all primates, these macaques love water. They live in large groups that split into smaller groups during daytime when they are foraging. They are omnivorous, feeding mainly on fruits, seeds, berries, cereals, fungi, and invertebrates. A study in peninsular Malaysia found them to be the primary, and perhaps the only, seed dispersers of the rattan species Daemonorops calicarpa and Calamus castaneus. There is a hierarchy among males, based on the strength, and among females, based on heredity. Thus, the daughter of the alpha female will immediately be placed above all other females in the group. The alpha female leads the group, while the male role is more to manage conflict within the group and to defend it. Female gestation lasts around 5.7 months. Cawthon Lang KA. 2005 September 12.

Sexual maturity is reached at the age of 3–5 years. In Thailand, they have been trained for 400 years to harvest coconuts. ==Habitat and distribution== This macaque is mostly found in rainforest up to 2000 meters, but will also enter plantations and gardens.Payne, J., and C. M. Francis. 1998. A Field Guide to the Mammals of Borneo. The Sabah Society, Kota Kinabalu, Sabah. It is found in the southern half of the Malay Peninsula (only just extending into southernmost Thailand), Borneo, Sumatra and Bangka Island. There are reports of the species having been present in Singapore before 1950, but these were likely escaped pets.

It is long, has a drainage area of , and has a mean discharge of 570 m³/s (745 yd³/s). While 80% of its drainage area is in Quebec, the river flows for a short distance through Ontario before it ends in Hannah Bay off James Bay. Because of its undeveloped nature, easy upstream access, and the possibility to paddle to and take out at Moosonee, the Harricana River is popular for canoeing trips to James Bay. ==Geography== The Harricana originates at Lake Blouin just north of Val-d'Or. From here De Montigny and Lemoine Lakes add to it before it flows through a series of lakes such as Malartic, La Motte, and Figuery Lakes. After flowing through the town of Amos, one more significant lake follows: Lake Obalski. North of Amos the river crosses lush boreal forests, where extensive logging takes place. Toward its mouth at Hannah Bay, the forest gradually decreases and is replaced with many wetlands. Here the Harricana has considerable speed and a flat relief, flowing through undeveloped wilderness. ===Notable tributaries=== (in downstream order) * Berry River * Desboues River * Miniac River * Octave River * Coigny River * Plamondon River * Samson River * Turgeon River ** Theo River ** Wawagosic River *Kesagami River ==History== Log driving on the Harricana at Amos, circa 1916. The Harricana was first used by the Algonquins as a river route. As a tributary of the James bay, and thus of the Hudson Bay, the Harricana River and its basin were part of Rupert's Land, de facto property of the Hudson's Bay Company by exclusive charter of 1670. But not until 1801, Alexander MacKenzie mapped the entire route of the river for the first time and identified it by name Harricanaw. In 1835, the map of Bradford called it Harricana. The Rupert's Land Act 1868 transferred the river and its basin to Canada and was officially annexed to the Province of Quebec in 1898. Thereafter colonization and settlement on the upper Harricana began in earnest. In 1906, Henry O' Sullivan explored the shores of Harricana and in 1908, the first camps were established on its banks at the rapids. These were provisioning camps for the transcontinental railroad construction. A few years later, in 1910, the first colonists arrive and found the town of Amos at the place where the railroad crosses the river. ==Toponymy== The river's name originates from the Algonquin word Nanikana, meaning \\"the main way\\" Environnement Québec, North Harricana River Aquatic Reserve (Online version) or \\"Biscuit River\\", depending on the source. Biscuit (or ànakonà in Algonquin, aanakonaa in Ojibwe, and aaihkunaau in East James Bay Cree) refers to bannock- like the unusual flat stones, sand, limestone and clay concretions, which are found in the river, called Pierres de fée or \\"fairy stones.\\"Grand Quebec.com, Harricana River The Harricana River and its mouth at Hannah Bay is visible on the left.

N. Seetharam about an old woman who has to deal with complex relationships with people of different generations she is put up with. The title in Kannada literally means \\"cruelty\\". The cast includes Renukamma Murugodu in the lead role as Rangajji, with supporting roles portrayed by Vishwas, H. G. Dattatreya and T. V. Gurumurthy. The film won two awards at the 43rd National Film Awards — Best Feature Film in Kannada and Best Child Artist (Vishwas). ==Plot summary== Kraurya is the story of Rangajji, a widow who loves to tell stories of fantasy to the children of her village. Rangajji's hardships start when her only son dies young mysteriously. Rangajji goes to live with a distant relative of hers, only to receive a cold welcome. Life goes on endlessly for Rangajji. She longs to tell stories to children, but her freedom is severely restricted. While she spends every day in boredom, Murty the youngest son of the family becomes close to Rangajji. Rangajji feels a new lease of life when the eldest son of the family Subbanna decides to go to Bangalore to start his own private business. Rangajji lends the money Subbanna needs, thinking that Subbanna might help her find her husband's close friend Mr.Padmanabiah in Bangalore. Subbanna leaves for Bangalore. After a few months Rangajji leaves for Bangalore along with Murty only to receive another cold welcome from Subbanna. She tries to find Mr.Padmanabiah with Murty's help. When her search ends, she comes to know that Mr.Padmanabiah is no more. Her last ray of hope dims out and leaves her in a state of mental shock, desperation and defeat. She loses her will to live. Murty decides to take her back to the village. But a spate of events during the journey back to the village leaves Rangajji physically wounded. Murty tries to take control of the situation, but a small boy that he is, he fails. The climax of the film shows Rangajji in an unconscious state lying in the police station, while Murty afraid the police might arrest him for murder makes a desperate getaway. ==Cast== * Renukamma Murugodu as Rangajji * Master Vishwas * H.

N. Suresh * Manjunath * Munishyamappa ==The inner theme== \\"Kraurya\\" is a Kannada word meaning \\"cruelty\\". The story and the film deal with the violence of the human mind. The protagonist is a victim of this violence. Girish Kasaravalli contemplates on how humans can wreck other's lives by displaying behaviour lacking humanitarian consideration. We know that something we say can hurt another person. But we still say it. That we know it is just a fact, never a reality. Kraurya effectively showcases this. Sometimes, cruelty of the mind is far more penetrating than cruelty in the physical sense. The former has immense potential to delve deep into human mind and leave the person devastated for the rest of his life, never to rise again. We witness all these through the film. The metamorphosis of Rangajji from a woman bubbling with life and enthusiasm to a lonely woman waiting to die effectively showcases the power and notoriety of human mind. ==Highlights== *The sudden transition in the life of the protagonist was well picturised and creates a lasting impression on the viewer. The scene shows Rangajji visiting a watch shop during her search. It is here that she learns of her husband's friend's death. Unable to believe it, she rejects the fact that Mr.Padmanabiah could be dead. The person in the shop shows her reflection in the mirror and says that if she could be so old, Mr.Padmanabiah could dead too. Rangajji for the first time looks at herself in the mirror like she had never looked before. She feels her grey hair, her toothless mouth, the wrinkles of her face... She realises that she is very old too and maybe her death is nearing. It is just this one realization that transforms her. She no longer desires to live and just waits in darkness for death. *The climax, like in all of Girish Kasaravalli's films was a major highlight. Rangajji is lying in a police station. She is in a place where nobody knows her. She is aware of nothing as she is unconscious. Murty tries his best to revive her. When the police realize that the old woman may die any moment, they threaten Murty that if something happens to Rangajji, they will arrest him. Murty tries to wake up Rangajji, but she just lies motionless on the ground. In a moment of desperation, fear and hopelessness, Murty runs away from the police station never to return again. ==Actors and performances== Renukamma Murugodu as Rangajji delivered a world class performance in the film. Kraurya was the most memorable film of the actress. Master Vishwas as Murty won a national award for his role. The film also featured senior artistes like H.G.Dattatreya and Mr. Gurumurty. ==Awards and screenings== *Kraurya won the silver lotus award for the best Kannada film of the year. *Master Vishwas won the national award for the best child artiste. *It also won the Karnataka state award for the second best film. *Kraurya was screened at the Hong Kong International Film Festival. ==References== Category:1996 films Category:Indian films Category:Kannada-language films Category:Best Kannada Feature Film National Film Award winners Category:1990s Kannada-language films ","title":"Kraurya"},{"id":"9074163","text":"Isleworth Studios is the common name of two former film studios in Great Britain. __TOC__ ==Worton Hall Studios 1913-1952== Worton Hall Studios were based on Worton Hall, in Isleworth. This house was built in 1783 and rebuilt and extended in the early 19th century. In 1913, it was acquired, together with a nine-acre estate, by film producer George Berthold Samuelson. The ground floor rooms became dressing-rooms, canteen, wardrobe and other offices; the upper rooms became bedrooms for anyone staying overnight. Filming of Conan Doyle's A Study in Scarlet began in summer 1914 and the studios were officially opened on 1 July. Samuelson gained publicity by producing a fictitious newsreel during the early years of the First World War and over the next few years many silent films were shot here, many based on novels such as Little Women. In 1922, the studios, generally known as Isleworth Film Studios, were sold to British Super Films, in which Samuelson retained an interest. However, in 1928, an expensive lawsuit with the American actress Betty Blythe forced Samuelson to sell Worton Hall to British Screen Productions. By 1931 the studios were being used by Fidelity Films. Films produced here included Madame Guillotine, with Madeleine Carroll. In 1934, they were leased by Alexander Korda and in 1936 he produced Things to Come, based on The Shape of Things to Come by H G Wells. Wells wrote the screenplay, Arthur Bliss the music. From 1936 to 1944, the studios were owned by Criterion Film Productions, and afterwards by British Lion. They closed in 1952 and were then used for 20 years by the National Coal Board as a Mining Research Centre. Worton Hall survives and has been acquired by Bovis Homes for conversion into flats. In 1993, part of the building was leased by the Driving Standards Agency and is still used (as of 2011) as the Isleworth driving test centre. Part of the site is used as an industrial estate. Films produced here include Invader (1936) with Buster Keaton; Under Secret Orders (1937) otherwise called Mademoiselle Docteur, with Erich von Stroheim; The Small Back Room (1949); State Secret (1950) with Douglas Fairbanks Jnr. Shooting of The Third Man began here in 1948 before moving to Shepperton. In 1951, shortly before the studios closed, much of The African Queen was filmed here. For instance, the scenes in which Bogart and Hepburn are seen in the water were all shot in studio tanks at Isleworth Studios, Middlesex. These scenes were considered too dangerous to shoot in Africa. All of the foreground plates for the process shots were also done in studio.Embracing Chaos: Making ‘The African Queen' a documentary film, as an extra for Paramount Pictures 2009 (the current owner of the US rights) restoration for region 1 and 4K ==Odeon Isleworth 1957-2001== Isleworth Studio (the former Odeon Isleworth), from a sales brochure. Began in March 1935 as Odeon Isleworth, one of the Odeon Cinemas. The Bauhaus-influenced building has a Germanic style and was designed by George Coles. It closed in 1957, a victim of the rise in popularity of television. The cinema was then gutted and converted to a studio. Whilst being used as Isleworth Studios, the original Odeon sign was visible up until the early 1990s. Equator Films (now HandMade Films) purchased the studio in 1999 but ultimately sold it.

Depending upon caliber, the cylinder holds either 5 (9mm, .38 spl, .357 magnum), 6 (.32 magnum), 7 (.22 magnum), or 8 (.22 LR), cartridges. Centennials feature a fully enclosed (internal) hammer, which makes them Double Action Only (DAO) firearms. Like all other \\"J-frame\\" Smith & Wesson revolvers, they have a swing-out cylinder. Centennial models have been made in different versions like PD \\"Personal Defense\\", LS \\"Lady Smith\\", and M&P; \\"Military & Police\\" ==History== The original Centennial Model 40 was introduced in 1952, and was named for the company's 100th anniversary. ==ModelsModel 40 and 42=== The Smith & Wesson Model 40 originally debuted as the Centennial in 1952 and was renamed the Model 40 in 1957. The Model 40 is chambered in .38 special and has a five-round capacity. It is a snub-nose revolver with a 1 7/8-inch barrel. It is built on Smith & Wesson's J-frame and weighs 21 oz. empty. The revolver was made with a grip safety as some shooters could not get used to the idea of firing a revolver without cocking the hammer. Smith & Wesson reintroduced this model in 2007 as a collector's piece with some models featuring a case hardened finish by Doug Turnbull. The Model 42 came out in 1952 as the Airweight Centennial but was changed in 1957 to the Model 42. The gun was the same design as the Model 40 except the frame was made of an aluminum alloy, resulting in a lower weight than the Model 40. The Model 42 was discontinued in 1974. ===Model 640=== A Smith & Wesson Model 642 revolver with an open cylinder and ergonomic rosewood grips The Model 640 revolver has been in production since 1990 and was chambered for .38 Special. It was fitted with a standard barrel of 1-7/8 inch length. The second model had a slightly heavier and longer barrel of 2-1/8 inch length. A 3\\" barreled version was offered until 1993, when it was dropped from production. In 1996 S&W; began chambering the 640 in .357 Magnum. Because of the power of the .357 magnum cartridge, the frame is strengthened just in front of the cylinder release on those models. ===Model 442 and 642=== The 442 has an aluminum frame and blued carbon steel cylinder. The 642 has an aluminum frame and stainless steel cylinder. From 1993 through 1996, the 442 was made with a satin nickel finish. thumb ===Model 940=== In 1991 S&W; introduced the Model 940, similar in appearance to the 640, but chambered in 9mm Luger. Use of a moon clip is required to headspace and extract the rimless 9mm cartridges. The 940 could also chamber and extract the short-lived 9mm Federal (9x19mmR) rimmed cartridge. From 1991 to 1992, a 3-inch barreled version was available. In 1998, the 940 was dropped from production. ===Model 340 and 342=== In 2001 a Scandium framed version was introduced in .357 Magnum designated as the Model 340. This revolver weighs 10.9 ounces. The model M&P; 342 was introduced in 2001 as a special run of revolvers that are identical to a Model 340 but chambered only for .38 Special +P due to some police departments ammunition restrictions. ==Design limitations (Scandium Versions)== Ammunition with bullet weight less than should not be used due to the risk of frame erosion from powder that is still burning after expulsion of the light projectile. Further, recoil may propel the cases of unfired rounds in the cylinder rearward, with enough force to unseat the bullets, causing the cylinder to jam. Accuracy is compromised in these ultra-light revolvers since the barrel is a steel sleeve liner rather than a single solid piece of steel. ==References== ==External links== *The Smith & Wesson Centennial, History and Development. *Review of the Smith & Wesson Model 642CT. *Ballistics By The Inch tests of the .38 Special cartridge.

He was one of the first and most influential British settlers in Kenya. Lord Delamere was the son of Hugh Cholmondeley, 2nd Baron Delamere, and his second wife, Augusta Emily Seymour, daughter of Sir George Hamilton Seymour. Lord Delamere moved to Kenya in 1901 and acquired vast land holdings from the British Crown. Over the years, he became the unofficial 'leader' of the colony's European community. He was as famous for his tireless labours to establish a working agricultural economy in East Africa as he was for childish antics among his European friends when he was at his leisure. ==Early years== Vale Royal Great House, formerly the seat of the Barons of Delamere – sold in 1947 Delamere left Eton at the age of sixteen with the intention of entering the British Army,Best, Nicholas, (1979).

He continued to play a role in the militia Cheshire Yeomanry Cavalry with the rank of captain. The young baron inherited a sizeable estate in the North of England, including land that had been in the Cholmondeley family since 1615Pakenham, Compton. \\"Kenya as a White Man's Country; The Story of Lord Delamere and a Colony That Has Peculiarly Interesting Racial and Social Problems,\\" New York Times. 7 July 1935.: and the ancestral seat at Vale Royal in the county of Cheshire. \\"Lady Delamere Dies in Africa,\\" New York Times. 19 May 1914;Holland, G.D et al. (1977). Vale Royal Abbey and House, pp. 20–32; Westair-Reproductions: Cheshire, Museum finder ==African expeditionary explorer== The young Lord Delamere made his first trip to Africa in 1891 to hunt lion in British Somaliland, and returned yearly to resume the hunt. In 1894 he was severely mauled by an attacking lion, and was only saved when his Somali gunbearer, Abdullah Ashur, leaped on the lion, giving Delamere time to retrieve his rifle. As a result of the attack, Lord Delamere limped for the rest of his life; he also developed a healthy respect for Somalis.Bull, Bartle (1992). Safari: A Chronicle of Adventure, p.188. It is believed that on one of these Somaliland hunting trips, Delamere coined the term 'white hunter', the term which came to describe the white safari hunter in colonial East Africa. Delamere employed a professional hunter named Alan Black and a native Somali hunter to lead the safari. As the story goes, to avoid confusion, the Somali was referred to as the 'black hunter', and Black was called the 'white hunter'.Brian Herne, White Hunters: The Golden Age of Safaris,\\" Henry Holt & Co., 1999, pages 6–7 On an expedition in 1896, Delamere, with a retinue including a doctor, taxidermist, photographer, and 200 camels, set out to cross the deserts of southern Somaliland, intending to enter British East Africa from the north. In 1897, he arrived in the lush green highlands of what is now central Kenya. ==Colonial Kenya== In 1899, the young Lord Delamere married Lady Florence Anne Cole, an Anglo-Irish aristocrat from a prominent Ulster family. She was the daughter of The 4th Earl of Enniskillen, a peer whose ancestral seat was Florence Court in south-west County Fermanagh in the north of Ireland. \\"Lord Delamere: Pioneer and Leader in Kenya,\\" The Times (London). 14 November 1931. The couple soon sought to relocate to what became known as 'the White Highlands' in Kenya. Lord Delamere originally applied for a land grant from the British Crown in May 1903, but was denied because the Governor of the Protectorate, Sir Charles Eliot, thought the land was too far from any population centre.Best, Happy Valley, p. 41 His next request for , near what is now Naivasha, was denied because the government felt that settlement by a colonising farmer might ignite conflicts with the Maasai tribesman who lived on the land. Delamere's third attempt at land acquisition was successful. He received a 99-year lease on of land that would be named 'Equator Ranch', requiring him to pay a £200 annual rent and to spend £5,000 on the land over the first five years of occupancy. In 1906, he acquired a large farm in Gilgil division, which would eventually include more than 50,000 acres (210 km²), located between Elementeita Railway Station, Elmenteita Badlands and Mbaruk Railway Station. This ranch he named Soysambu. Together, these vast possessions made Delamere one of Kenya's 'largemen'; the local name for the handful of colonists with the greatest land holdings. ==Farming== Among Kenya's white settlers, Lord Delamere was famous for his utter devotion to developing Kenyan agriculture. For many years his only homes in Kenya were native-style mud and grass huts, which his wife (who was Ulster Anglo-Irish) decorated with their fine English and Irish furnishings.Bull, Safari, p. 191 For twenty years, Delamere farmed his colossal land by trial, error and dogged effort, experimenting endlessly with crops and livestock, and accruing an invaluable stockpile of knowledge that would later serve as the foundation for the agricultural economy of the colony.Best, Happy Valley, p. 43 By 1905, Delamere was a pioneer of the East African dairy industry. He was also a pioneer at crossbreeding animals, beginning with sheep and chicken, then moving to cattle; most of his imported animals, however, succumbed to diseases such as foot and mouth and Red water disease.Kamau, John, Who was Lord Delamere?, The East African Standard, 22 May 2005, available at http://www.eastandard.net/archives/cl/hm_news/news.php?articleid=21034 Delamere purchased Ryeland Rams from England to mate with 11,000 Maasai ewes, and in 1904, imported 500 pure-bred merino ewes from New Zealand. Four-fifths of the merino ewes quickly died, and the remaining stock were moved to Delamere's Soysambu Ranch, as well as the remaining stock of 1,500 imported cattle that suffered from pleuro-pneumonia.Huxley, Elspeth, Settlers of Kenya (1975), pp. 29–30 Eventually, Lord Delamere decided to grow wheat. This, too, was plagued by disease, specifically Rust (fungus).Kamau, John, Who was Lord Delamere? By 1909, Delamere was out of money, resting his last hopes on a wheat crop that eventually failed. He was quoted by author Elspeth Huxley as commenting drily, 'I started to grow wheat in East Africa to prove that though I lived on the equator, I was not in an equatorial country.' Delamere eventually created a 'wheat laboratory' on his farm, employing scientists to manufacture hardy wheat varieties for the Kenyan highlands.Huxley, Settlers of Kenya, pp. 25–27 To supplement his income, he even tried raising ostriches for their feathers, importing incubators from Europe; this venture also failed with the advent of the motor car and the decline in fashion of feathered hats.Best, Happy Valley, p. 45 Delamere was the first European to start a maize farm, Florida Farm, in the Rongai Valley, and established the first flour mill in Kenya.Church, Archibald, East Africa: A New Dominion, 1970, pp. 287–8 By 1914, his efforts finally began to generate a profit.Huxley, Settlers of Kenya p. 30 ==Happy Valley set== Lord Delamere was active in recruiting settlers to East Africa, promising new colonists , with 200 people eventually responding.Hughes, Anthony John, East Africa: Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Penguin, 1969, p. 275 He persuaded some of his friends among the British landed gentry to buy large estates like his own and take up life in Kenya; he is credited with helping to found the so-called Happy Valley set, a clique of well-off British colonials whose pleasure-seeking habits eventually took the form of drug-taking and wife-swapping. The story is often told of Delamere riding his horse into the dining room of Nairobi's Norfolk Hotel and jumping over the tables.Barton, Fiona, The Curse of White Mischief, The Daily Mail, 23 September 2006 He was also known to knock golf balls onto the roof of the Muthaiga Country Club, the pink stucco gathering-place for Nairobi's white élite, and then climb up to retrieve them.Thurman, Judith, Isak Dinesen: Life of a Storyteller, MacMillan, 1999, p. 123 At the outbreak of World War I, Delamere was placed in charge of intelligence on the Maasai border, monitoring the movements of German units in German East Africa.Herne, Brian, White Hunters: The Golden Age of African Safaris, 1999, pp. 99 Delamere entertained many high-ranking official visitors to Kenya, including then Under-Secretary for the Colonies, Winston Churchill. He was also the first president of the East African Turf Club.Herne, White Hunters, pp. 21–33 ==Government== Delamere embodied the many contradictions of the committed East African settler. He was personally fond of many Africans, and particularly enjoyed the company of the Maasai (even gently tolerating their habit of pilfering his cattle for their own herds),Bull, Safari, pp. 189–191 but fought fiercely to maintain British supremacy in the colony. \\"The extension of European civilization was in itself a desirable thing,\\" he wrote in 1927. \\"The British race... was superior to heterogeneous African races only now emerging from centuries of relative barbarism... the opening up of new areas by means of genuine colonisation was to the advantage to the world.\\"Thurman, Judith, Isak Dinesen: The Life of a Storyteller, MacMillan, 1999, p. 180 Richard Meinertzhagen (himself a complex figure of Africa's colonial days) quoted Delamere as proclaiming, “I am going to prove to you all that this is a white man's country.”Meinertzhagen from African Diary, quoted in Ridgeway, Rick, The Shadow of Kilimanjaro, Owl Publishing Company, 1998, p. 194 These views held great sway among the settlers because Delamere was their undisputed, if unofficial, leader and, in some measure, spokesman for 30 years. He was a member of the Legislative Council, the Executive Council, and, in 1907, became President of the Colonists’ Association.Trzebinski, Errol, The Kenya Pioneers, W.W. Norton 1986, p. 129 and Berman, Bruce, Control & Crisis in Colonial Kenya: The Dialectic of Domination, James Currey 1990, p. 140 In 1921 he established the Reform Party. Errol Trzebinski, who wrote a number of books on Kenya's colonial elite, wrote of him: “Delamere was the Rhodes of Kenya and the settlers followed him both politically and spiritually.” Trzebinski, The Kenya Pioneers, p. 23 Another contemporary and former colonist said more or less the same: “(His) ascendancy over the settlers of Kenya has been enjoyed long enough for him to expect all men – and women – to do his bidding, and do it promptly. He is their Moses. For 25 years he has been their guide.”Hughes, East Africa: Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, p. 275 Beryl Markham, the aviator and author, was close with Delamere and his wife, who served for a few years as Markham's surrogate mother. She summed Delamere up thus: \\"Delamere had two great loves – East Africa and the Masai People.... Delamere's character had as many facets as cut stone, but each facet shone with individual brightness. His generosity is legendary, but so is his sometimes wholly unjustified anger.... To him nothing was more important than the agricultural and political future of British East Africa – and so, he was a serious man. Yet his gaiety and occasional abandonment to the spirit of fun, which I have often witnessed, could hardly be equalled except by an ebullient schoolboy.\\"Markham, Beryl, West With The Night, North Point Press, San Francisco, 1983, pp. 71–72 Delamere's efforts to steer Kenyan economic and racial policy, which often contravened the more pro-African intentions of the Colonial Office, were assisted by his powerful friends at home in Great Britain. Delamere, and other settlers, were so successful in affecting Kenya's politics that, in 1923, the British Government responded with the Devonshire White Paper, which declared officially that, in Kenya, the concerns of Africans were 'paramount', even when they conflicted with the needs of whites.Maxon, Robert, Struggle for Kenya: The Loss and Reassertion of Imperial Initiative, 1912–1923, Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 1993, pp. 13–14 == Legacy == Lord Delamere died in November 1931, at age 61. \\"Lord Delamere Dies on his African Ranch; Leader in Deoelopment of Kenya Colony—Was Pioneer in Big Game Hunting Expeditions,\\" New York Times. 14 November 1931. He was survived by his second wife, formerly Lady Charles Markham (née Gwladys Helen Beckett, daughter of Hon. Rupert Eveleyn Beckett). \\"Gwladys Lady Delamere\\" (obituary). New York Times. 23 February 1943; His widow, Gwladys, became the second female Mayor of Nairobi. She was portrayed by actress Susan Fleetwood in the 1941-set film White Mischief (1987) as \\"Gwladys Delamere\\", one of Lord Erroll's Happy Valley friends. He was succeeded in the barony by his son from his first marriage, Thomas. At his death, he left Kenya's agricultural economy healthy enough to develop into one of the most stable economies in Africa. He also left unpaid bank loans totalling £500,000. Nairobi's Sixth Avenue was named Delamere Avenue to commemorate his place in the development of the colony, and an eight-foot bronze statue of the 3rd Baron was erected at the street's head, across from the New Stanley Hotel. When Kenya achieved independence in 1963, many white settlers opted to sell their farms and leave the country rather than submit to African rule. Delamere's family, by then headed by his son Thomas, the 4th hereditary Baron, elected to remain and accept Kenyan citizenship. Other traces of Delamere's colonial \\"reign\\" were not permitted to linger. Delamere Avenue was renamed as Kenyatta Avenue, after Kenya's first president, Jomo Kenyatta, and the statue of Delamere was relocated to the family's Soysambu estate, where it faces out toward the mountain known locally as \\"Delamere's Nose\\" or \\"The Sleeping Warrior.\\" Among the Maasai, with whom Delamere was the first to establish a strong European connection, his family is now frequently reviled as those who \\"stole\\" the Maasai's land;Barton, The Curse of White Mischief but at his death, The Times reported that this complicated man had been amongst the very few Europeans who had made it a point to learn the Maasai language. One of the restaurants inside the Nairobi Norfolk Hotel has been known as the Lord Delamere Terrace for decades. \\"Traveling in Style : Our Hearts Are in the Highlands\\", David Lamb, LA Times, 20 March 1988, webpage: LAT-1988.

During his life he was a lay missionary with the Jesuits, a survivor of torture, a member of an Iroquois council, a translator, a diplomat, a militia captain, and a lay leader among the colonists of the Pointe-Lévy (now named Lévis city) in the Seigneury of Lauzon, a district of New France located on the South Side of Quebec City. ==Early life and recruitment by the Jesuits== Couture was born in 1618 in Saint-Godard-de-Rouen, Normandy, the son of Guillaume Couture Sr. and Madeleine Mallet.Douville, Raymond. \\"Couture, Gullaume (d. 1701)\\", in Dictionary of Canadian Biography, vol. 2, University of Toronto/Université Laval, 2003 Guillaume Sr. was a carpenter in the St. Godard district and young Guillaume was trained in the same occupation. However, by 1640 he was recruited by Jesuits to be a donné in New France to convert natives to Roman Catholicism. ===Work with Isaac Jogues=== Couture arrived in New France in 1640. In the summer of 1641 he went to work among the Hurons. The following spring Couture returned to Quebec in company with the Jesuit leader Isaac Jogues. During this period, Couture learned several major native languages, which increased his stature, for he could now work as a translator for the Jesuits. Couture also learned much about native culture and ways during this period. He was also a master carpenter, \\"a deadly marksman with the musket and a sincerely pious man.\\"Dupuy, Roger. \\"Guillaume Couture: my Canadian hero\\", The Catholic Register, October 30, 2008 ===Tortured by the Iroquois=== In August 1642, Couture, Jogues, lay missionary, René Goupil, and several Huron converts set out on their return to the Huron missions. An Iroquois war party ambushed the group. Right before the attack, Couture saw the Hurons, who realized what was about to happen, take off into the woods; Couture followed them as Jogues and Goupil were captured. When Couture realized that he had become separated from his companions he went back to search for them. Couture then encountered five Iroquois. One of them fired a gun at Couture, but missed. Couture returned fire, killing the warrior instantly. The other four Iroquois fell upon Couture and beat him with their war clubs. They also ran a spear through one of his hands. Later on, Couture, Jogues, and Goupil were subjected to even more torture. The Iroquois tore out Couture's fingernails, and bit the ends. Then the three men were stripped and forced to walk through a gauntlet, the Iroquois beating the three men with sticks. After arriving at an Iroquois village, an Iroquois leader took out a dull knife and began to cut off Couture's right middle finger. When this failed to work, the chief simply pulled the finger out of its socket. At this point, Couture was sent deep into Iroquois Country (present day upstate New York in Auriesville) where he was given to the family of the man he killed to be their slave. ==Diplomacy and release== His courage under torture plus his skills both as a marksman and carpenter earned the respect of his captors. So impressed were the Iroquois that they invited Couture to sit on their councils. No other European would ever get this honour. In 1645, de Montmagny, the governor of New France, decided it was time to end the war with the Iroquois. He released several Iroquois prisoners and sent them into Iroquois Country to negotiate a peace settlement. The Iroquois in turn released Couture, and asked him to act on their behalf, which Couture agreed to do. Couture arrived at Trois-Rivières and, along with two Iroquois leaders, was able to put an end (for the time) the war between the Five Nations Iroquois and the French. Instead of settling down after such an ordeal, Couture decided to go straight back to Huron Country. In 1646 he was reported as working in the Huron missions with Father Pijart. He only did this for only two years between 1645 and 1647. ==First settler of Pointe-Lévy in the Seignory of Lauzon== On May 15, 1647, he became the first settler of the Seignory of Lauzon at Pointe-Lévy (located across the Saint Lawrence River from Quebec City) which will become the city of Lévis in 1861. However, he was not a seignor because the Seignory of Lauzon was the property of Jean de Lauzon, the Governor of New France between 1651 and 1657. In 1649, the Jesuit leaders in New France voted unanimously to release Couture from his vows and to allow him to get married. The woman who Couture chose to be his bride was Anne Aymard, who was from St. André de Niort, in Poitou region of France. The couple would have ten children during their years of marriage. ==Last mission and last expedition in New France== During the 1650s and 1660s, Couture acted as a diplomat, going to New Netherland (present-day New York) to negotiate trade and to settle boundary disputes between the two colonies. In 1663, Couture was recruited by French Governor Pierre Dubois Davaugour for a mission in the North of New France. The main mission was to find the North Sea. However, Couture found the Mistassini Lake and he goes to the Rupert River. He was accompanied by Pierre Duquet and Jean Langlois and many Amerindians. This shipment consisted of 44 boats. No doubt Couture's skills with native languages came into good use. The party worked among the Papinachois, who lived in present-day northeastern Quebec. ==The administrator and Captain of the Militia of Pointe-Lévy== Sometime around 1666, with war with the Iroquois and the English looming, Couture, now living full-time in Pointe-Lévy (Lévis) since 1647. Couture was the main administrator and had been named Captain of the Militia for the area he lived in. This was a major honor in New France, going only to those who had proved themselves, something Couture had done again and again. In 1690, when Admiral William Phips invaded Quebec City Area with a force of New England colonists, Couture was able to prevent the English from attacking Pointe-Lévy at the age of 72. By this point, Couture was also the Chief Magistrate of the Pointe-Lévy (today Lévis) district. Among his jobs were to run the censuses, enforce government edicts, and run the local assemblies that met from time to time. Couture was also in charge of local court cases, being both judge and jury. On some occasions, Couture was invited to sit on the Sovereign Council, which ran New France for Louis XIV. The fact that the status-obsessed French government offered Couture a part-time seat on the council shows how highly the leaders of New France viewed him. ==Marriage and children== Plaque of Guillaume Couture in Lévis. Guillaume married Anne Emard (or Aymard) on November 16, 1649 in Quebec City, Quebec, Canada. Together they had the following children: * Guillaume (11 Oct 1662-15 Dec 1738) * Jean Baptiste (6 Nov 1650-22 Aug 1698) * Anne (22 Jan 1652-26 Nov 1684) * Louis (29 Aug 1654-?) * Marguerite (29 Feb 1656-28 Mar 1690) * Marie (18 Jun 1658-22 Jul 1702) * Charles (29 Nov 1659-9 Sep 1709) * Louise (19 Mar 1665-22 Dec 1751) * Eustache François (24 Mar 1667-16 May 1733) * Joseph Auger (27 Jul 1670-6 May 1733) ==Death== On November 18, 1700, Couture's wife, Anne, died. In the spring of 1701, Couture was 83 years old and ill, possibly from small pox. He was moved to the Hôtel-Dieu de Québec, where he died on April 4, 1701. The location of his tomb is unknown, as is the location of the tomb of Samuel de Champlain, founder of Quebec City. There is a park dedicated to Couture in Levis. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1618 births Category:1701 deaths Category:17th-century French Jesuits Category:Immigrants to New France Category:French Roman Catholic missionaries Category:Jesuit missionaries in New France Category:Roman Catholic missionaries in Canada ","title":"Guillaume Couture"},{"id":"9074254","text":"\\"Semper Fidelis\\" is the fifteenth episode of season one of the CBS drama Jericho. The episode's title, Latin for \\"always faithful\\", is the motto of the United States Marine Corps. ==Plot== As the episode begins, Mayor Gray Anderson is trying to find a solution to the town's supply problems, recognizing that Jericho does not have enough supplies to survive the winter. He believes that their only option is to begin forcing the refugees who have arrived since the bombs exploded to leave. Some townspeople, having lost faith, are already making plans to leave for the south, believing that it will be easier to survive in the warmer climate. Former Mayor Johnston Green begs for them to stay, fearing that most of them will die or be murdered before they can reach safety. Just when all seems hopeless, a detachment of the United States Marine Corps under the command of a Gunnery Sergeant arrives in Jericho, traveling with an M1A2 Abrams tank, and claim that they are there to help restore electricity. Jake befriends one of the Marines, Cpl. Maggie Mullen (Erin Daniels), and they rapidly become attracted to each other. However, it turns out that the Marines' arrival might not be such a good thing for the town when the Green family begins to suspect that they are impostors. Before the Marines are able to render any real assistance, and after the people of Jericho have begun sharing their own supplies with them, the Marines receive orders over the radio from Dodge City, recalling them to base. Mayor Anderson wants to stay on the Marines' good side, believing that, on their return, they will help to ensure that Jericho receives desperately needed supplies. To this end, Anderson decides to see them off with a fireworks display and a farewell dinner. As all of this unfolds, a stand-off occurs inside the Hawkinses' house between Sarah Mason and Robert Hawkins. Suspicious of Sarah's intentions, Hawkins steals her hand-held communications terminal. When he reads her messages, he learns of her duplicity, and that she intends to use his family as leverage in order to acquire \\"the package\\". When Sarah discovers the theft, she takes Hawkins' son hostage, telling Hawkins that she was upset to find that he had decided to return to his family in spite of the relationship that they had had together before the bombs went off. Hawkins wants to know for whom Sarah is working, but she insists that she is now working only for herself. She plans to sell \\"the package\\" to the highest bidder in order to ensure her own survival. Sarah ends up holding Hawkins' entire family at gunpoint, and he decides to hand over \\"the package\\", retrieving it from behind a concrete wall in his basement. It turns out that it is the unused atomic bomb that had been destined for Columbus, Ohio. After a physical altercation Sarah gets the upper hand on both Richard and Darcy, but she is shot dead by Allison. Upset and frightened, Darcy leaves immediately with both children. Allison says \\"I love you\\" to her father for what seems to be the first time. After his family leaves, Robert makes contact with Sarah's partners using her hand-held device, and pretends to be her, telling her partners that he is now dead and that Sarah wants to know where she should take the bomb to deliver it to them. The mysterious contacts reply that they will shortly communicate where they will meet. ==Significance== The episode does not definitively state whether or not what the \\"Marines\\" tell Jericho about the outside world is true or not. They say that the six regional governments have been re-united into one. They also say that Secretary of Health and Human Services Charles, who is referred to in \\"Black Jack\\" as being the first survivor in the presidential line of succession, is now officially the president, and that Columbus, Ohio, where Hawkins' bomb was to have been detonated, is now the new capital of the U.S.A. They also report that the bombs used in the attacks were supplied by North Korea, that the attacks were funded by Iran, and that the U.S. had retaliated against both countries. They also say that American forces are still engaged in pursuing the surviving terrorists all over the world. However, since the \\"Marines\\" themselves later confess that they got this information in bits and pieces of news that they had heard, and made up material to fill in the blanks, none of it can be assumed to be factual. However, it is worth noting that the \\"Marines\\" talked of the \\"war being over\\" before they were told that the citizens of Jericho have received little news about the outside world. ==Reception== Geoff Berkshire at the LA Times praised the episode as \\"a perfect example of the show in top form\\". He said \\"[Sarah's] death at the hands of Robert's daughter, Allison (Jazz Raycole), is thrilling and bold. There's something rather creepy about Allison becoming the second teenage killer on this show. It's precisely that kind of unsettling choice that underscores the bleakness and desperation that makes Jericho stand out from other network dramas.\\"'Jericho': It's never too late LA Times, July 27, 2007 ==References== ==External links== * \\"Semper Fidelis\\" at CBS.com Category:2007 American television episodes Category:Jericho (2006 TV series) episodes ","title":"Semper Fidelis (Jericho)"},{"id":"9074258","text":"The C. H. Moore Homestead, in Clinton, Illinois, is one of two Registered Historic Places in DeWitt County. The other, the Magill House, was added to the Register in 2003. The Moore House was added in 1979. ==History== Construction was started on the C. H. Moore Homestead by John and Minerva Moore Bishop. Mr. Bishop was a prosperous grain and lumber dealer in Clinton. Work on the C. H. Moore Homestead was completed in 1867 after the Civil War had ended and life took on a more normal pattern. Soon after this, the Bishops lost their only child. After Minerva Bishop's death in the early 1880s, Mr. Bishop sold the house to his brother-in-law, Clifton H. Moore. Moore, an educated man, was the first attorney to commence practice in Clinton, having hung out his shingle in 1841. He served as co-counsel with Abraham Lincoln on several cases heard in the DeWitt County circuit court, of which future United States Supreme Court justice David Davis was the presiding judge. The west wing of the home was added in 1887 to house Mr. Moore's vast collection of books. At the time of his death, he owned approximately 7,000 volumes, the largest collection of books in downstate Illinois. The two-story high library has a vaulted ceiling and stenciled walls. There are four-season windows on the upper level, and an iron railing around the suspended upper gallery. The furniture and paintings include many of the original Moore furnishings. Moore's book collection was left to the city of Clinton upon his death and is now housed at the Vespasian Warner Public Library. Moore lived in the house until his death in 1901. The house sat in disrepair for several decades until 1967 when it was purchased and restored by the newly formed DeWitt County Museum Association. The Apple 'N Pork festival, held annually the last full weekend in September, was first held in 1968 to help raise funds to restore and maintain the mansion. ==C.H.

It was formed during the process of political fragmentation of the Kievan Rus' in the early 12th century. As a result of that process, effective rule of Grand Princes of Kiev was gradually reduced to central regions of Kievan Rus' (around its capital city Kiev), thus forming a reduced princely domain, known as the inner Principality of Kiev. It existed as a polity until the middle of the 14th century. ==Territory== The inner Principality of Kiev occupied land areas on both banks of the Dnieper River, bordering the Principality of Polotsk to the north-west, the Principality of Chernigov to the north-east, Poland to the west, the Principality of Galicja to the south-west and Cumania to the south-east. Later, Kiev would be bordered by the separated Principality of Turov-Pinsk to the north and the joined Principality of Galicja-Volhynia to the west. ==History== Reconstructed Orthodox church in Kiev The region of the Kievan Rus' fragmented in the early 12th century and a number of semi- autonomous successor states arose. Kiev remained the core of the country and was the center of the spiritual life with the office of the Metropolitan of the Russian Orthodox Church in Kiev. Following the death of Mstislav I of Kiev in 1132, the semi-autonomous states were de facto independent and so led to the emergence of the Principality of Kiev as a separate state. The importance of the Kievan Principality began to decline. In the years 1150-1180 many of its cities such as Vyshhorod, Kaniv, and Belgorod sought independence as individual principalities. The emergence of the principalities of Vladimir- Suzdal and Galicia-Volhynia resulted in the transition of the political and cultural center of Rus' as well as the migration of citizens to cities like Vladimir and Halych. The Mongol invasion of Rus' left the Principality of Kiev in a severely ruined state. Following the invasion, it was now under the formal suzerainty of the Grand Prince of Vladimir-Suzdal, Alexander Nevsky, who in turn was a vassal to the Mongols. After the Battle of Irpen in 1321, Kiev was the object of desire for the Lithuanian Grand Duke Gediminas, and it was incorporated into the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in 1362.

Mount Guyot is flanked to the northwest by South Twin Mountain, to the northeast by Mount Zealand, and to the south by Mount Bond. Guyot is on the northern boundary of the Pemigewasset Wilderness. The immediate area around the summit consists of high-altitude spruce-fir forest or krummholz. The north face of Mount Guyot drains into the Little River, thence into the Ammonoosuc and Connecticut rivers, and into Long Island Sound in Connecticut. The southeast face of Guyot drains into Jumping Brook, thence into the North Fork of the East Branch of the Pemigewasset River, thence into the Pemigewasset and Merrimack rivers, and into the Gulf of Maine in Massachusetts.

It was never a typical college of the University, in that there was an internal division in the college, by staircase units, into parts where the monasteries sending monks had effective authority.David Knowles, The Religious Orders in England vol. II (1955) p.14 calls it 'something of a patchwork' and (p.17) 'a loose confederation of small groups rather than a college.' The overall head was a Prior.Appointed by the Abbot of Malmesbury, but there was a regent master appointed by the provincial Benedictine presidents. (Knowles p.14) It later became Gloucester Hall, an annexe of St John's College and was again refounded in 1714 as Worcester College by Sir Thomas Cookes. ==History== The initial foundation was from 1283. John Giffard gave a house, in Stockwell Street, Oxford.Stockwell Street no longer exists, but it \\"ran northwards from the Castle along the line of the present Worcester and Walton Streets\\" (Nicholas de Stockwell, Oxford History). There was early friction with the local Carmelites.This persisted into the 16th century.The House of White Friars, Victoria County History, 1907. This was a donation to the Benedictines of the province of Canterbury. Control of the 13 places for monks fell to the abbey of St. Peter, Gloucester.Houses of Benedictine monks: Gloucester College, Oxford', A History of the County of Oxford: Volume 2 (1907), pp. 70–71 Date accessed: 23 January 2007. The first prior was Henry de Heliun. Pope Benedict XII in 1337 laid down, in the bull Pastor bonus, that 5% of Benedictine monks should be university students.Knowles p.15. But from the middle of the fourteenth century onwards there was an alternative, at the University of Cambridge.Knowles p.17. There were also the Benedictine Durham College, Oxford, and Canterbury College, Oxford. Even though the catchment area after 1337 included the Province of York, numbers of students were never high, one reason being the cost of living in Oxford (which the home monastery had to meet). After the Black Death, Gloucester College was closed for a time. In 1537 it was found to have 32 students. At the Dissolution the property passed to the English Crown, then to the Bishop of Oxford in 1542,Jericho Echo Online. who sold it to Sir Thomas White. White was the founder of St John's College, Oxford, and Gloucester Hall, as it then became, was treated as an Annexe to St John's College. The penultimate Principal of Gloucester Hall, Benjamin Woodroffe, established a 'Greek College' for Greek Orthodox students to come to Oxford, part of a scheme to make ecumenical links with the Church of England. This was active from 1699 to 1705, although only 15 Greeks are recorded as members. The status of Gloucester Hall changed in the 18th century, when it was refounded in 1714 by Sir Thomas Cookes as Worcester College, Oxford. Oxford's Gloucester Green, which was opposite the old College, and the Gloucester House building within the current college preserve the name. ==Principals of Gloucester Hall== *1560–1561 William Stocke *1561–1563 Richard Eden *1563–1564 Thomas Palmer *1564–1576 William Stocke *1576–1580 Henry Russell *1580–1581 Christopher Bagshawe *1581–1593 John Delabere *1593–1626 John Hawley *1626–1647 Degory Wheare *1647–1647 John Maplett *1647–1660 Tobias Garbrand *1660–1662 John Maplett *1662–1692 Byrom Eaton *1692–1711 Benjamin Woodroffe *1712–1714 Richard Blechynden.'Gloucester Hall and Worcester College', A History of the County of Oxford: Volume 3: The University of Oxford (1954), pp. 298-309.

As with other fungi the light spores are distributed globally and the fungi develop wherever conditions are suitable - it lives on dead and decaying wood, and is a common, widespread saprotroph. The fungus is ball-shaped, with a hard, friable, shiny black fruiting body 2 to 7 centimeters wide. It resembles a chunk of coal, which gives it several of its common names, including coal fungus and carbon balls. According to legend, King Alfred once hid out in a countryside homestead during war, and was put in charge of removing baking from the oven when it was done. He fell asleep and the cakes burned. Daldinia concentrica is said to resemble a cake left to this fate. The flesh of the fungus is purple, brown, or silvery-black inside, and is arranged in concentric layers. Most sources agree that like tree rings, these layers are related to seasonal growth. The asci are cylindrical and arranged inside the flask-shaped perithecium. When each ascus becomes engorged with fluid it extends outside the perithecium and releases spores. D. concentrica contains several unique compounds, including a purple polycyclic pigment and a metabolite called concentricol, which is oxidized squalene. Many types of insects and other small animals make their home inside this species of fungus. ==Uses== The fungus is a useful form of tinder for fire-lighting. The brown variety is usually too heavy and dense to be much good; the black variety is lighter and better. It does need to be completely dry, whereupon it will take a spark from traditional flint and steel. It burns slowly, much like a charcoal briquette, with a particularly pungent smoke. Once lit it usually requires constant oxygen flow to keep burning, such as through swinging the fungus or blowing on it. Fragments can be broken off to expose more embers and transferred to a tinder bundle to create an open flame. ==Ecological value== Caterpillars of the concealer moth Harpella forficella have been found to eat this fungus. This fungus plays a pivotal role in accelerating the decomposition of the fallen branches of ash trees, which are naturally dropped very frequently. ==References== *Glick, Phyllis (1979).

Before the school was built it ran classes in the garden of a church not very far from the site of the school itself. Many of the teachers who taught at the school before it had been built remain with it. The school was built on vlei, meaning that during the rains many of the fields flooded. There was also a small river that ran along the back of the school but was out of bounds for pupils. There were three houses into which the pupils were divided - Angwa, Gwebi and Mazoe, named after three rivers in Zimbabwe and colour-coded: Angwa - yellow, Gwebi - red, and Mazoe - Blue. The logo also reflects the 'twin rivers' where the two blue lines at the top of the shield unite into one river. After 2000 a school hall, consisting of staff room, offices, tuck shop and other storage rooms, was built, costing in the region of ZW$6 million. ==Roles of pupils== The pupils do not have many responsibilities until they reach Grade 7 when they will be appointed as head of the three different houses, heads of sports events, prefects and Head Boy and Girls. Badges are worn by those who have been appointed such positions and prefects can be identified by the square, plain turquoise ties that they wear - this includes the girls who do not normally wear ties as part of their uniform. ==See also== * List of schools in Zimbabwe ==References== Category:Schools in Harare Category:Private schools in Zimbabwe Category:Co- educational schools in Zimbabwe Category:Day schools in Zimbabwe Category:Educational institutions established in 1993 Category:1993 establishments in Zimbabwe Category:Member schools of the Association of Trust Schools ","title":"Twin Rivers Primary School"},{"id":"9074332","text":"John Peltz (April 23, 1861 – February 27, 1906) was a professional baseball player in the 19th century.

The club originally played in the City of Southampton Sunday League, where they won every possible honour as they rose up through the divisions. In 1976–77 they reached the semi-final of the FA Sunday Cup. Road-Sea then purchased some land at Staplewood, Marchwood, near Southampton and with the aid of some fine financial backing, and momentum from team manager Peter Price saw the facilities develop. This resulted in an ambitious application to join the semi-professional Southern League being sensationally accepted in 1982 despite no history whatsoever of playing Saturday football. Whilst in the Southern League Southern Division, Road-Sea silenced their critics as they pushed for promotion to the Premier Division and after finishing a highly creditable 3rd in their debut season behind champions Fisher Athletic and Folkestone, they won promotion as champions in 1983–84. That season, they also enjoyed a fine run in the FA Vase where they reached Round 5 before being eliminated 1-2 away at Leyton Wingate. Road-Sea continued to thrive in the highly competitive Premier Division as they then finished a marvellous 5th in 1984–85. The following season was much tougher as the club finished mid-table. In 1986 Road-Sea surprisingly decided to withdraw from the league and become founder members of the new Wessex League (formed that year mostly by the Hampshire League's top clubs with the best facilities). Road-Sea then finished runners- up, reached the final of the Hampshire Senior Cup and won both the League and Russell Cotes Cup's but the club's short but amazing history was ended when they lost their financial backing, which resulted in their sudden demise. The club's home ground, Road-Sea Park was later sold to Southampton who use it to stage Reserve and Youth team games as well as training. ==Honours== *Southern League Southern Division **Champions 1983–84 *Wessex League **Runners-up 1986–87 *Wessex League Cup **Winners 1986–87 *Hampshire FA Senior Cup **Finalists 1986–87 *Hampshire FA Russell Cotes Cup **Winners 1986–87 ==Playing Records League === { class=\\" collapsible collapsed\\" style=text-align:center !Season !Division !Position !Significant events - 1982/83Southern League Southern Division3/18 - 1983/84Southern League Southern Division1/20Champions, Promoted - 1984/85Southern League Premier Division5/20 - 1985/86Southern League Premier Division16/20Left competition - 1986/87Wessex League 2/17Runners- up - left competition } === FA Cup === { class=\\" collapsible collapsed\\" style=text-align:center !Season !Round !Opponents !Result - 1982/83Did not enter  - 1983/84Preliminary RoundH v Oxford CityW 4-1 -  1st Qualifying RoundH v WaterloovilleD 0-0 -  ReplayA v WaterloovilleL 1-2 - 1984/851st Qualifying RoundA v Melksham TownW 3-0 -  2nd Qualifying RoundA v Chippenham TownD 2-2 -  ReplayH v Chippenham TownL 1-2 - 1985/861st Qualifying RoundA v Redditch UnitedD 1-1 -  ReplayH v Redditch UnitedW 3-2 -  2nd Qualifying RoundH v ClandownW 2-1 -  3rd Qualifying RoundA v Ton PentreD 1-1 -  ReplayH v Ton PentreL 1-2 - 1986/871st Qualifying RoundA v Littlehampton TownW 7-1 -  2nd Qualifying RoundA v Devizes TownW 2-0 -  3rd Qualifying RoundH v Fareham TownL 0-3 } === FA Trophy === { class=\\" collapsible collapsed\\" style=text-align:center !Season !Round !Opponents !Result - 1984/851st Qualifying RoundA v Taunton TownL 0-2 - 1985/861st Qualifying RoundA v AndoverW 3-0 -  2nd Qualifying RoundH v Bridgend TownD 1-1 -  ReplayA v Bridgend TownL 0-3 } === FA Vase === { class=\\" collapsible collapsed\\" style=text-align:center !Season !Round !Opponents !Result - 1982/83Did not enter  - 1983/84Preliminary RoundA v PaghamW 3-1 -  Round 1A v ChobhamW 5-0 -  Round 2H v Maidenhead UnitedW 4-2 -  Round 3H v Exmouth TownW 3-0 -  Round 4H v Exmouth TownW 3-0 -  Round 5A v Leyton WingateL 1-2 - 1986/87Preliminary RoundA v Warminster TownW 5-0 -  Round 1A v Lymington TownD 1-1 -  ReplayH v Lymington TownD 1-1 -  ReplayH v Lymington TownL 0-2 } ==Famous Players== A number of former professionals played for Road-Sea Southampton during their Southern League days.

The tournament is run by the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Hockey League with the finals administered by the National Hockey League's Pittsburgh Penguins franchise. Finals are held in three divisions: A, AA, AAA. The tournament was held at the Civic/Mellon Arena until it closed in 2010. The tournament determines the regional champions from western Pennsylvania. The winners in each division play the eastern Pennsylvania Flyers Cup champions in the Pennsylvania State High School Ice Hockey Championship. Ice hockey is not administered by the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association as are other high school sports. ==List of champions== The Penguins Cup champions have been very successful against the Flyers Cup winners in the state championship Pennsylvania Cup which began in 1981. Between 1993 and 2003, the Penguins Cup champions won 28 of 33 Pennsylvania Cups, including nine consecutive class A titles from 1993 to 2002, and eight consecutive in AA, 1996 to 2003. Penguins Cup champions went on to win all three Pennsylvania Cups in 1989, 1994, 1996, 1997, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2006, and 2011; and in both AA and AAA in 1984 and 1987 before the A division was added in 1989. In AAA, Meadville Area Senior High School has won the most cups, with eight. The team also won one cup in AA. From 1992 to 1996, Meadville won five consecutive Penguins Cup and Pennsylvania state championships. In AA, Bishop Canevin High School has won six cups. In A, Bishop McCort High School of Johnstown has six Penguins Cups and five state championships, including four in a row from 1994 to 1997. Bethel Park HIgh School has won 7 AAA Penguins Cups 1983 and 2012 including 5 AAA Pennsylvania State Titles in 1997, 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2005.

It was written and directed by Vladimir Yanchev. The film satirizes the eternal fear of all Bulgarians to have contractors fixing problems in their houses. The story develops at the end of the seventies, the time of the vast expansion of the centralized system for heat- and warm water supply, in Sofia. ==Plot== The inhabitants of one apartment building want to have central heating. However, with significant effort and strong connections, the Journalist manages to unveil that the turn of their building, to be included in the central heating network, has not yet come. Moreover, it is unclear in how many years it will come. In their despair and after a number of arguments, quarrels and even a bit of shooting, they decide do undertake actions that are considered illegal at that time (see Special notes). They hire contractors to lay the pipes. Three guys show up, the contract is signed and the money is paid in advance. Soon the work begins. With skills and acts provoking severe doubt in their professionalism, the contractors manage to drill holes in all walls and ceilings and then they disappear. Panic and despair strikes the residents. What are they to do now...? A decision is made. They must find the crooks and bring them back to finish what they have started. Finally, it turns out that our three fellows are already in jail. Then, the sufferers strike a bargain with the director of the jail; if he lets the cheats out to finish the job, then there will always be a shift of three people from the inhabitants of the building to take their places in jail. Moreover, such highly educated people like the Journalist and the Academician will give series of lectures to the prisoners, which will help the director to fulfill the cultural plan of the prison for the year. The job is finally done but the director of the prison is brought to Court. And our group of humble citizens, who have been only trying to provide themselves with some heat for the cold winter days, follow him in the dock. However, the Court finds them not guilty, taking into account their good will and the fact that contractors have just come to the house of the Judge. ==Cast== * Naum Shopov as the Journalist * Konstantin Kotsev as the Pensioner Snegov * Stoyan Stoychev as the Customs officer * Georgi Cherkelov as the Academician * Tatyana Lolova as the Manager * Valentin Rusetzki as the Driver * Luchezar Stoyanov as the Stage production Student * Bozhidar Lechev as the Mototehnika Worker * Grigor Vachkov as Contractor 1 * Todor Kolev as Contractor 2 * Stefan Danailov as Contractor 3 * Georgi Popov as the Director of the prison * Andrey Chaprazov as himself * Stoyanka Mutafova as the Judge ==Special notes== In socialist Bulgaria private enterprises were considered illegal.

It began with the arrival of Pioneer 10 into the Jovian system in 1973, and, , has continued with eight further spacecraft missions. All of these missions were undertaken by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and all but two have been flybys that have taken detailed observations without the probe landing or entering orbit. These probes make Jupiter the most visited of the Solar System's outer planets as all missions to the outer Solar System have used Jupiter flybys to reduce fuel requirements and travel time. On 5 July 2016, spacecraft Juno arrived and entered the planet's orbit—the second craft ever to do so. Sending a craft to Jupiter entails many technical difficulties, especially due to the probes' large fuel requirements and the effects of the planet's harsh radiation environment. The first spacecraft to visit Jupiter was Pioneer 10 in 1973, followed a year later by Pioneer 11\\\\. Aside from taking the first close-up pictures of the planet, the probes discovered its magnetosphere and its largely fluid interior. The Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 probes visited the planet in 1979, and studied its moons and the ring system, discovering the volcanic activity of Io and the presence of water ice on the surface of Europa. Ulysses further studied Jupiter's magnetosphere in 1992 and then again in 2000. The Cassini probe approached the planet in 2000 and took very detailed images of its atmosphere. The New Horizons spacecraft passed by Jupiter in 2007 and made improved measurements of its and its satellites' parameters. The Galileo spacecraft was the first to have entered orbit around Jupiter, arriving in 1995 and studying the planet until 2003. During this period Galileo gathered a large amount of information about the Jovian system, making close approaches to all of the four large Galilean moons and finding evidence for thin atmospheres on three of them, as well as the possibility of liquid water beneath their surfaces. It also discovered a magnetic field around Ganymede. As it approached Jupiter, it also witnessed the impact of Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9. In December 1995, it sent an atmospheric probe into the Jovian atmosphere, so far the only craft to do so. In July 2016, the Juno spacecraft, launched in 2011, completed its orbital insertion maneuver successfully, and is now in orbit around Jupiter with its science programme ongoing. The European Space Agency selected the L1-class JUICE mission in 2012 as part of its Cosmic Vision programme to explore three of Jupiter's Galilean moons, with a possible Ganymede lander provided by Roscosmos. JUICE is proposed to be launched in 2022. The Indian Space Research Organisation plans to launch the first Indian mission to Jupiter in 2020s through Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mark III. The Chinese National Space Administration plans to launch a mission to Jupiter around 2029 to explore the planet and its moons. A list of previous and upcoming missions to the outer Solar System (including Jupiter) can be found at the List of missions to the outer planets article. ==Technical requirements== Jupiter as seen by the space probe Cassini Flights from Earth to other planets in the Solar System have a high energy cost. It requires almost the same amount of energy for a spacecraft to reach Jupiter from Earth's orbit as it does to lift it into orbit in the first place. In astrodynamics, this energy expenditure is defined by the net change in the spacecraft's velocity, or delta-v. The energy needed to reach Jupiter from an Earth orbit requires a delta-v of about 9 km/s, compared to the 9.0–9.5 km/s to reach a low Earth orbit from the ground. Gravity assists through planetary flybys (such as by Earth or Venus) can be used to reduce the energetic requirement (i.e. the fuel) at launch, at the cost of a significantly longer flight duration to reach a target such as Jupiter when compared to the direct trajectory.Fischer, 1999, p. 44 Ion thrusters capable of a delta-v of more than 10 km/s were used on the Dawn spacecraft. This is more than enough delta-v to do a Jupiter fly-by mission from a solar orbit of the same radius as that of Earth without gravity assist.CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 64th EDITION, (C) 1983, page F-141 A major problem in sending space probes to Jupiter is that the planet has no solid surface on which to land, as there is a smooth transition between the planet's atmosphere and its fluid interior. Any probes descending into the atmosphere are eventually crushed by the immense pressures within Jupiter. Another major issue is the amount of radiation to which a space probe is subjected, due to the harsh charged- particle environment around Jupiter (for a detailed explanation see Magnetosphere of Jupiter). For example, when Pioneer 11 made its closest approach to the planet, the level of radiation was ten times more powerful than Pioneers designers had predicted, leading to fears that the probes would not survive. With a few minor glitches, the probe managed to pass through the radiation belts, but it lost most of the images of the moon Io, as the radiation had caused Pioneer's imaging photo polarimeter to receive false commands. The subsequent and far more technologically advanced Voyager spacecraft had to be redesigned to cope with the radiation levels. Over the eight years the Galileo spacecraft orbited the planet, the probe's radiation dose far exceeded its design specifications, and its systems failed on several occasions. The spacecraft's gyroscopes often exhibited increased errors, and electrical arcs sometimes occurred between its rotating and non-rotating parts, causing it to enter safe mode, which led to total loss of the data from the 16th, 18th and 33rd orbits. The radiation also caused phase shifts in Galileo's ultra-stable quartz oscillator. ==Flyby missionsPioneer program (1973 and 1974)=== Animation of Pioneer 11 trajectory around Jupiter from 30 November 1974 to 5 December 1974 Pioneer 10 was the first spacecraft to visit Jupiter. The first spacecraft to explore Jupiter was Pioneer 10, which flew past the planet in December 1973, followed by Pioneer 11 twelve months later. Pioneer 10 obtained the first-ever close-up images of Jupiter and its Galilean moons; the spacecraft studied the planet's atmosphere, detected its magnetic field, observed its radiation belts and determined that Jupiter is mainly fluid. Pioneer 11 made its closest approach, within some 34,000 km of Jupiter's cloud tops, on December 4, 1974. It obtained dramatic images of the Great Red Spot, made the first observation of Jupiter's immense polar regions, and determined the mass of Jupiter's moon Callisto. The information gathered by these two spacecraft helped astronomers and engineers improve the design of future probes to cope more effectively with the environment around the giant planet. ===Voyager program (1979)=== Time-lapse sequence from the approach of Voyager 1 to Jupiter Voyager 1 began photographing Jupiter in January 1979 and made its closest approach on March 5, 1979, at a distance of 349,000 km from Jupiter's center. This close approach allowed for greater image resolution, though the flyby's short duration meant that most observations of Jupiter's moons, rings, magnetic field, and radiation environment were made in the 48-hour period bracketing the approach, even though Voyager 1 continued photographing the planet until April. It was soon followed by Voyager 2, which made its closest approach on July 9, 1979, 576,000 km away from the planet's cloud tops. The probe discovered Jupiter's ring, observed intricate vortices in its atmosphere, observed active volcanoes on Io, a process analogous to plate tectonics on Ganymede, and numerous craters on Callisto. The Voyager missions vastly improved our understanding of the Galilean moons, and also discovered Jupiter's rings. They also took the first close-up images of the planet's atmosphere, revealing the Great Red Spot as a complex storm moving in a counter-clockwise direction. Other smaller storms and eddies were found throughout the banded clouds (see animation on the right). Two new, small satellites, Adrastea and Metis, were discovered orbiting just outside the ring, making them the first of Jupiter's moons to be identified by a spacecraft.(discovery) A third new satellite, Thebe, was discovered between the orbits of Amalthea and Io. The discovery of volcanic activity on the moon Io was the greatest unexpected finding of the mission, as it was the first time an active volcano was observed on a celestial body other than Earth. Together, the Voyagers recorded the eruption of nine volcanoes on Io, as well as evidence for other eruptions occurring between the Voyager encounters. Europa displayed a large number of intersecting linear features in the low- resolution photos from Voyager 1\\\\. At first, scientists believed the features might be deep cracks, caused by crustal rifting or tectonic processes. The high-resolution photos from Voyager 2, taken closer to Jupiter, left scientists puzzled as the features in these photos were almost entirely lacking in topographic relief. This led many to suggest that these cracks might be similar to ice floes on Earth, and that Europa might have a liquid water interior. Europa may be internally active due to tidal heating at a level about one-tenth that of Io, and as a result, the moon is thought to have a thin crust less than thick of water ice, possibly floating on a ocean. ===Ulysses (1992)=== On February 8, 1992, the Ulysses solar probe flew past Jupiter's north pole at a distance of 451,000 km. This swing-by maneuver was required for Ulysses to attain a very high-inclination orbit around the Sun, increasing its inclination to the ecliptic to 80.2 degrees. The giant planet's gravity bent the spacecraft's flightpath downward and away from the ecliptic plane, placing it into a final orbit around the Sun's north and south poles. The size and shape of the probe's orbit were adjusted to a much smaller degree, so that its aphelion remained at approximately 5 AU (Jupiter's distance from the Sun), while its perihelion lay somewhat beyond 1 AU (Earth's distance from the Sun). During its Jupiter encounter, the probe made measurements of the planet's magnetosphere. Since the probe had no cameras, no images were taken. In February 2004, the probe arrived again at the vicinity of Jupiter. This time the distance from the planet was much greater—about 120 million km (0.8 AU)—but it made further observations of Jupiter. ===Cassini (2000)=== In 2000, the Cassini probe, en route to Saturn, flew by Jupiter and provided some of the highest-resolution images ever taken of the planet. It made its closest approach on December 30, 2000, and made many scientific measurements. About 26,000 images of Jupiter were taken during the months-long flyby. It produced the most detailed global color portrait of Jupiter yet, in which the smallest visible features are approximately across. A major finding of the flyby, announced on March 5, 2003, was of Jupiter's atmospheric circulation. Dark belts alternate with light zones in the atmosphere, and the zones, with their pale clouds, had previously been considered by scientists to be areas of upwelling air, partly because on Earth clouds tend to be formed by rising air. Analysis of Cassini imagery showed that the dark belts contain individual storm cells of upwelling bright-white clouds, too small to see from Earth. Anthony Del Genio of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies said that \\"the belts must be the areas of net-rising atmospheric motion on Jupiter, [so] the net motion in the zones has to be sinking\\". Other atmospheric observations included a swirling dark oval of high atmospheric-haze, about the size of the Great Red Spot, near Jupiter's north pole. Infrared imagery revealed aspects of circulation near the poles, with bands of globe-encircling winds, and adjacent bands moving in opposite directions. The same announcement also discussed the nature of Jupiter's rings. Light scattering by particles in the rings showed the particles were irregularly shaped (rather than spherical) and likely originated as ejecta from micrometeorite impacts on Jupiter's moons, probably on Metis and Adrastea. On December 19, 2000, the Cassini spacecraft captured a very-low-resolution image of the moon Himalia, but it was too distant to show any surface details. ===New Horizons (2007)=== Video of volcanic plumes on Io, as recorded by New Horizons in 2008 The New Horizons probe, en route to Pluto, flew by Jupiter for a gravity assist and was the first probe launched directly towards Jupiter since the Ulysses in 1990. Its Long Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI) took its first photographs of Jupiter on September 4, 2006. The spacecraft began further study of the Jovian system in December 2006, and made its closest approach on February 28, 2007. Although close to Jupiter, New Horizons instruments made refined measurements of the orbits of Jupiter's inner moons, particularly Amalthea. The probe's cameras measured volcanoes on Io, studied all four Galilean moons in detail, and made long-distance studies of the outer moons Himalia and Elara. The craft also studied Jupiter's Little Red Spot and the planet's magnetosphere and tenuous ring system. On March 19, 2007 the Command and Data Handling computer experienced an uncorrectable memory error and rebooted itself, causing the spacecraft to go into safe mode. The craft fully recovered within two days, with some data loss on Jupiter's magnetotail. No other data loss events were associated with the encounter. Due to the immense size of the Jupiter system and the relative closeness of the Jovian system to Earth in comparison to the closeness of Pluto to Earth, New Horizons sent back more data to Earth from the Jupiter encounter than the Pluto encounter. ==Orbiter missionsGalileo (1995–2003)=== Galileo trajectory around Jupiter from 1 August 1995 to 30 September 2003 The first spacecraft to orbit Jupiter was the Galileo orbiter, which went into orbit around Jupiter on December 7, 1995. It orbited the planet for over seven years, making 35 orbits before it was destroyed during a controlled impact with Jupiter on September 21, 2003. During this period, it gathered a large amount of information about the Jovian system; the amount of information was not as great as intended because the deployment of its high-gain radio transmitting antenna failed. The major events during the eight-year study included multiple flybys of all of the Galilean moons, as well as Amalthea (the first probe to do so). It also witnessed the impact of Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 as it approached Jupiter in 1994 and the sending of an atmospheric probe into the Jovian atmosphere in December 1995. A sequence of Galileo images taken several seconds apart shows the appearance of the fireball appearing on the dark side of Jupiter from one of the fragments of Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 hitting the planet. Cameras on the Galileo spacecraft observed fragments of Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 between 16 and 22 July 1994 as they collided with Jupiter's southern hemisphere at a speed of approximately 60 kilometres per second. This was the first direct observation of an extraterrestrial collision of solar system objects. While the impacts took place on the side of Jupiter hidden from Earth, Galileo, then at a distance of 1.6 AU from the planet, was able to see the impacts as they occurred. Its instruments detected a fireball that reached a peak temperature of about 24,000 K, compared to the typical Jovian cloudtop temperature of about 130 K (−143 °C), with the plume from the fireball reaching a height of over 3,000 km. An atmospheric probe was released from the spacecraft in July 1995, entering the planet's atmosphere on December 7, 1995. After a high-g descent into the Jovian atmosphere, the probe discarded the remains of its heat shield, and it parachuted through 150 km of the atmosphere, collecting data for 57.6 minutes, before being crushed by the pressure and temperature to which it was subjected (about 22 times Earth normal, at a temperature of 153 °C). It would have melted thereafter, and possibly vaporized. The Galileo orbiter itself experienced a more rapid version of the same fate when it was deliberately steered into the planet on September 21, 2003 at a speed of over 50 km/s, in order to avoid any possibility of it crashing into and contaminating Europa. Major scientific results of the Galileo mission include: * the first observation of ammonia clouds in another planet's atmosphere—the atmosphere creates ammonia ice particles from material coming up from lower depths; * confirmation of extensive volcanic activity on Io—which is 100 times greater than that found on Earth; the heat and frequency of eruptions are reminiscent of early Earth; * observation of complex plasma interactions in Io's atmosphere which create immense electrical currents that couple to Jupiter's atmosphere; * providing evidence for supporting the theory that liquid oceans exist under Europa's icy surface; * first detection of a substantial magnetic field around a satellite (Ganymede); * magnetic data evidence suggesting that Europa, Ganymede and Callisto have a liquid-saltwater layer under the visible surface; * evidence for a thin atmospheric layer on Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto known as a 'surface-bound exosphere'; * understanding of the formation of the rings of Jupiter (by dust kicked up as interplanetary meteoroids which smash into the planet's four small inner moons) and observation of two outer rings and the possibility of a separate ring along Amalthea's orbit; * identification of the global structure and dynamics of a giant planet's magnetosphere. On December 11, 2013, NASA reported, based on results from the Galileo mission, the detection of \\"clay- like minerals\\" (specifically, phyllosilicates), often associated with organic materials, on the icy crust of Europa, moon of Jupiter. The presence of the minerals may have been the result of a collision with an asteroid or comet according to the scientists. ===Juno (2016)=== Animation of Juno trajectory around Jupiter from 1 June 2016 to 31 July 2021 NASA launched Juno on August 5, 2011 to study Jupiter in detail. It entered a polar orbit of Jupiter on July 5, 2016. The spacecraft is studying the planet's composition, gravity field, magnetic field, and polar magnetosphere. Juno is also searching for clues about how Jupiter formed, including whether the planet has a rocky core, the amount of water present within the deep atmosphere, and how the mass is distributed within the planet. Juno also studies Jupiter's deep winds,NASA Selects New Frontiers Concept Study: Juno Mission to Jupiter  Jupiter Today – Your Daily Source of Jupiter News which can reach speeds of 600 km/h. ===Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer (2022)=== ESA's Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer (JUICE) has been selected as part of ESA's Cosmic Vision science program. It is expected to launch in 2022 and, after a series of flybys in the inner Solar System, arrive in 2030. In 2012, the European Space Agency's selected the JUpiter ICy moon Explorer (JUICE) as its first Large mission, replacing its contribution to EJSM, the Jupiter Ganymede Orbiter (JGO). The partnership for the Europa Jupiter System Mission has since ended, but NASA will continue to contribute the European mission with hardware and an instrument. ==Proposed missions== The Europa Clipper is a mission proposed to NASA to focus on studying Jupiter's moon Europa. In March 2013, funds were authorized for \\"pre-formulation and/or formulation activities for a mission that meets the science goals outlined for the Jupiter Europa mission in the most recent planetary decadal survey\\". The proposed mission would be set to launch in the early 2020s and reach Europa after a 6.5 year cruise. The spacecraft would fly by the moon 32 times to minimize radiation damage. China has announced plans to send its first mission to Jupiter in 2036.http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2017-09/20/content_32245016.htm ===Canceled missions=== Because of the possibility of subsurface liquid oceans on Jupiter's moons Europa, Ganymede and Callisto, there has been great interest in studying the icy moons in detail. Funding difficulties have delayed progress. The Europa Orbiter was a planned NASA mission to Europa, which was canceled in 2002. Its main objectives included determining the presence or absence of a subsurface ocean and identifying candidate sites for future lander missions. NASA's JIMO (Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter), which was canceled in 2005, and a European Jovian Europa Orbiter mission were also studied, but were superseded by the Europa Jupiter System Mission. The Europa Jupiter System Mission (EJSM) was a joint NASA/ESA proposal for exploration of Jupiter and its moons. In February 2009 it was announced that both space agencies had given this mission priority ahead of the Titan Saturn System Mission. The proposal included a launch date of around 2020 and consists of the NASA-led Jupiter Europa Orbiter, and the ESA-led Jupiter Ganymede Orbiter. ESA's contribution had encountered funding competition from other ESA projects. However, the Jupiter Europa Orbiter (JEO), NASA's contribution, was considered by the Planetary Decadal Survey to be too expensive. The survey supported a cheaper alternative to JEO. == Human exploration == While scientists require further evidence to determine the extent of a rocky core on Jupiter, its Galilean moons provide the potential opportunity for future human exploration. Particular targets are Europa, due to its potential for life, and Callisto, due to its relatively low radiation dose.Artemis Society International official website In 2003, NASA proposed a program called Human Outer Planets Exploration (HOPE) that involved sending astronauts to explore the Galilean moons. NASA has projected a possible attempt some time in the 2040s. In the Vision for Space Exploration policy announced in January 2004, NASA discussed missions beyond Mars, mentioning that a \\"human research presence\\" may be desirable on Jupiter's moons. Before the JIMO mission was cancelled, NASA administrator Sean O'Keefe stated that \\"human explorers will follow.\\" === Potential for colonization === NASA has speculated on the feasibility of mining the atmospheres of the outer planets, particularly for helium-3, an isotope of helium that is rare on Earth and could have a very high value per unit mass as thermonuclear fuel.Robert Zubrin, Entering Space: Creating a Spacefaring Civilization, section: Settling the Outer Solar System: The Sources of Power, pp. 158–160, Tarcher/Putnam, 1999, Factories stationed in orbit could mine the gas and deliver it to visiting craft. However, the Jovian system in general poses particular disadvantages for colonization because of the severe radiation conditions prevailing in Jupiter's magnetosphere and the planet's particularly deep gravitational well. Jupiter would deliver about 36 Sv (3600 rem) per day to unshielded colonists at Io and about 5.4 Sv (540 rems) per day to unshielded colonists at Europa, which is a decisive aspect due to the fact that already an exposure to about 0.75 Sv over a period of a few days is enough to cause radiation poisoning, and about 5 Sv over a few days is fatal.Robert Zubrin, Entering Space: Creating a Spacefaring Civilization, section: Colonizing the Jovian System, pp. 166–170, Tarcher/Putnam, 1999, . { class= style=\\"text-align:center; font-size:11px\\" + Jovian radiation ! Moon !! rem/day -  Io  3600 -  Europa  540 - Ganymede  8 -  Callisto  0.01 - ! Earth (Max) !! 0.07 - ! Earth (Avg) !! 0.0007 } Ganymede is the Solar System's largest moon and the Solar System's only known moon with a magnetosphere, but this does not shield it from cosmic radiation to a noteworthy degree, because it is overshadowed by Jupiter's magnetic field. Ganymede receives about 0.08 Sv (8 rem) of radiation per day. Callisto is farther from Jupiter's strong radiation belt and subject to only 0.0001 Sv (0.01 rem) a day. For comparison, the average amount of radiation taken on Earth by a living organism is about 0.0024 Sv per year; the highest natural radiation levels on Earth are recorded around Ramsar hot springs at about 0.26 Sv per year. One of the main targets chosen by the HOPE study was Callisto. The possibility of building a surface base on Callisto was proposed, because of the low radiation levels at its distance from Jupiter and its geological stability. Callisto is the only Galilean satellite on which human settlement is feasible. The levels of ionizing radiation on Io, Europa and long-term on Ganymede, are hostile to human life, and adequate protective measures have yet to be devised. It could be possible to build a surface base that would produce fuel for further exploration of the Solar System. In 1997, the Artemis Project designed a plan to colonize Europa. According to this plan, explorers would drill down into the Europan ice crust, entering the postulated subsurface ocean, where they would inhabit artificial air pockets. == See also == * Exploration of Mercury * Exploration of Venus * Exploration of Mars * Exploration of Saturn * Exploration of Uranus * Exploration of Neptune == References == ==External links== * Chronology of Lunar and Planetary Exploration * NASA missions to Jupiter Category:Jupiter Category:Spaceflight Category:Discovery and exploration of the Solar System ","title":"Exploration of Jupiter"},{"id":"9074484","text":", sometimes credited as Shōji Kobayashi or Issei Mori, was a Japanese actor.

The NTTR land area includes a \\"simulated Integrated Air Defense System\\", several individual ranges with 1200 targets, and 4 remote communication sites. The current NTTR area and the range's former areas have been used for aerial gunnery and bombing, for nuclear tests, as a proving ground and flight test area, for aircraft control and warning, and for Blue Flag, Green Flag, and Red Flag exercises. ==Geography== The Nevada Test and Training Range land area is mostly Central Basin and Range ecoregion (cf. southernmost portion in the Mojave Desert), and smaller ecoregions (e.g., Tonopah Basin, Tonopah Playa, & Bald Mountain biomes) are within the area of numerous basin and range landforms of the NTTR. ===Landforms=== The NTTR is at the serpentine section of the Great Basin Divide in southern Nevada and uses numerous landforms for military operations, e.g., Groom Lake near the northeast NTTR border is the airstrip for Area 51, the 1955 Site II west of the lake's WWII field. Tolicha Peak and Point Bravo are the sites of for electronic combat ranges, and the Mercury Valley is the eponym for a Cold War camp that became Mercury, Nevada. The Tonopah Test Range, within the boundaries of the NTTR (e.g., \\"Nellis Range 75\\") includes Antelope Lake, Radar Hill, and the \\"Cactus, Antelope, and Silverbow Springs\\". ===Northern Range=== The Northern Range includes the Tolicha Peak Electronic Combat Range (TPECR, e.g., Range 76 targets 76-03, -05, -11, & -14) (form is depicted in the 2006 Developing Cultural Resources Data Management Tools presentation) and Tonopah Electronic Combat Range (the Wildhorse Management Area encircled by the Northern Range is not part of the NTTR.) ===Eastman Airfield Target=== The Eastman Airfield Target (Target 76-14, Korean Airfield, ) is a Range 76 target northwest of the TPECR. The target has a northeastern taxiway loop, characteristic for the former Soviet Air Force base at Jüterbog Airfield in East Germany, and three ramps in front of hangars on the western side of the loop. The other taxiways have a similar layout to Jüterbog, although the runway is about shorter. There are two accompanying SAM sites, one northwest of the airfield, and one northwest just like the original. ===Southern Range=== The Southern Range includes the Point Bravo Electronic Combat Range. An area of about of the Southern Range that was withdrawn from the Desert National Wildlife Range is co-managed by the USAF and the USFWS. ===Nearby facilities=== In addition to Nellis AFB, areas outside of the current NTTR land area are used for related activities, e.g., about of the former military range land (relinquished 1942, e.g. ranges 46-56, and ) is under the Nellis \\"Area A\\" airspace that is a Military Operations Area (MOA). The Formerly Used Defense Site north and northeast of the NTTR with \\"Stone Cabin, Hot Creek, Railroad, Tikaboo, and Sand Spring valleys\\" is a \\"former portion of the Tonopah Bombing Range\\", includes \\"Permit Required Confined space\\", and prohibits vehicles in \\"suspected ordnance impact area[s]\\" (e.g., \\"green markings\\" indicate chemical agents). Most areas adjacent to the NTTR are managed by the Bureau of Land Management for limited non-residential use such as grazing. Temporary sites, e.g., for Patriot Communications Exercises (about \\"21 days per exercise\\"), are in the \\"ADA activity area\\" east of the NTTR with 13 empty \\"500 feet by 500 feet\\" sites for mobile electronic equipment on BLM land in the \\"Sand Springs Valley, Coal Valley, Delamar Valley, and Dry Lake Valley\\" (\\"general area\\" of the Key Pittman WMA) and \\"under MOA airspace\\". ==History== \\"Tertiary age\\" lava flows formed 5 erupted groups in the area, and block faulting such as the Siebert and Mizpah faults formed the ranges and valleys. Precambrian and Paleozoic marine sediments form an \\"almost uniform thickness of 40,000 feet\\", and surface geology is \\"typically the Cenozoic Era continental deposits and some Paleogene volcanic rocks\\". Located at the southern tip of the Great Basin tribes area, the eventual range area was crossed by the Old Spanish Trail (trade route), was south of the Pony Express route, and was split by the 37th parallel north of the 1850 New Mexico & 1863 Arizona territories' northwest corner. In the 1930s the land had been used as an Animal Sanctuary where the Department of the Interior made it a wildlife reservation. However, in 1942 during World War II the region restricted it from public access for the War Department to use. The original bombing range had been used for the 1900–1921 silver rush (e.g., Tonopah Mining District U.S. Geological Survey \\"Professional Paper No. 42\\" maps included are Plate III (mining claim map, pp. 28–9) & Plate XVI (geologic map with streets and buildings on pp. 116–7). & Tonopah Manhattan Stage Route), and the region was subdivided into smaller numbered management areas (e.g., Area 2, Area 5, Area 11, Area 12, Area 25, Area 27, Area 52), which are used for names of some of the range installations (e.g., \\"Area 3 Compound\\" and \\"Area 51\\" for \\"Groom Lake Field\\"). ===Tonopah Bombing Range=== The Tonopah Bombing Range was designated on federal land \\"withdrawn ... October 29, 1940, from the public domain\\" and in June 1941, the \\"Tonopah Gunnery and Bombing Range\\" was split at \\"37 degrees and 30 minutes\\" latitude into the \\"Tonopah General Range\\" and \\"Las Vegas General Range\\". On October 28, 1941, \\"United States v. 1,855,720 Acres of land ...\\" (US Fifth District) was initiated to seize private land, and in July 1942 the Fourth Air Force Bombing and Gunnery Range Detachment from \\"Muroc Lake\\" arrived as the 1st unit. Several Nevada World War II Army Airfields were established, e.g., the August 1942 Tonopah Army Air Field in the north area and in the south, Indian Springs Auxiliary Army Airfield and its additional fields, e.g., at Area 18 (Aux. Field#4) & Area 51 (Aux. Field#1). In February 1943, Indian Springs AAF was being used for the 82d Flying Training Wing for air-to-air gunnery training, and Indian Springs AAF closed in January 1947. In June 1947 Tonopah AAF was declared excess along with its 3 auxiliary areas (Mizpah & Butler housing terraces and Columbia Junction gasoline unloading station). The Indian Springs main facility re-opened in January 1948 and on June 13, 1949, Air Training Command merged the Las Vegas Bombing and Gunnery Range and the Tonopah Bombing and Gunnery Range. On June 28, 1949, the \\"Gunnery Range of the Tonopah Air Force Base\\" had about and after the 1949 Las Vegas Air Force Base was renamed on April 30, 1950, an Atomic Energy Commission committee selected the for a nuclear test site on December 12, 1950. The land was ideal for training aerial gunners because the land was far from people and contained dry lake beds, which worked perfectly for target practices. ===Nellis Air Force Gunnery and Bombing Range=== A 680-square mile section of the Nellis Air Force Gunnery and Bombing Range was designated the Nevada Proving Grounds (NPG) on December 18, 1950. The new NPG included \\"Yucca and Frenchman Flats, Paiute and Rainier Mesas\\". The presidential order also established Groom Lake Field (colloq. \\"The Pig Farm\\") at the WWII installation. The first NPG nuclear test was for Operation Ranger on January 27, 1951, and the Indian Springs main facility (renamed an Air Force Base in 1951) supported NPG testing after ARDC General Order No. 39 on July 16, 1952. The NPG Camp Desert Rock \\"military support facility\\" (now the private Desert Rock Airport) operated September 1951-October 7, 1957 (electricity was from AEC's Camp Mercury) and closed June 18, 1964. In 1955 on the southwest corner of Groom Lake, a survey team laid out the 5,000-foot (1,500 m) north–south \\"Site II\\" runway for Project AQUATONE. The 1st Lockheed U-2 (Article 341) left the Skunk Works in a C-124 cargo plane for the AQUATONE site in July 1955 and first flew on July 29 during a runway test. The Tonopah Test Range (TTR) land was withdrawn from public use in 1956 to replace nuclear test sites at the \\"Salton Sea Test Base\\" and the Yucca Flat site, and in 1957 Sandia Laboratories began TTR operations at Cactus Flat. From 1956-1969/70, the Las Vegas Air Force Station and Tonopah Air Force Stations provided Reno Air Defense Sector radar tracks and in 1957, the \\"instrumented AEC range at Tonopah\\" was used by NAS Fallon and Point Mugu pilots. \\"A safety experiment (Project 57 No. 1) with ground zero coordinates of N 932646, E 688515 was detonated on April 24, 1957\\" in \\"Area 13\\" at the northeast NTTR boundary. In 1958, the Tonopah Test Range Airport was planned with a single runway of . In 1960, Camp Mercury was a base camp for Project 5.5 that studied nuclear detonation effect on the Northrop F-89D Scorpion (a similar Project 6.5 was for effect of nuclear detonations on the Nike Hercules missile system).. (An AN/MSQ-1A was used for tracking aircraft during NUDET testing.) A 1961 Public Land Order transferred USAF land to the AEC, and after the 1962 RBS Express #2 near the Hawthorne Naval Ammunition Depot was used for Radar Bomb Scoring of flights over the range, the Hawthorne Bomb Plot radar station operated in Babbitt until . Operation Roller Coaster was a TTR nuclear test series in May and June 1963 and in November and December 1965, B-52 Combat Skyspot testing at the range used the only CONUS AN/MSQ-77 developed for the Vietnam War. (partial transcription at 1stCombatEvaluationGroup.com) Planning to integrate the range with the Fallon and Hill/Wendover/Dugway ranges to create the Great Basin's \\"Continental Operations Range\\" ended in 1975, the 1st year for a Nellis range Red Flag exercise. ===Nellis Air Force Range=== The Nellis Air Force Range (NAFR) was used to bury wreckage of the 1978 Groom Lake & 1979 NAFR Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk crashes, and additional Cold War accidents at the range included the 1975 NAFR TR-1 crash,https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=YzJcAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=yVUNAAAAIBAJ&pg;=5447,1924221&dq;=nellis+air+force+range&hl;=en https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wa0tAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=LYEFAAAAIBAJ&pg;=1742,4964182&dq;=nellis+air+force+range&hl;=en the 1979 Tonopah MiG-17 crash during training versus an Northrop F-5, the 1984 Little Skull Mountain MiG-23 crash, which killed a USAF general, and the 1986 NAFR crash, which \\"Air Force sources\\" identified as an \\"F-19\\" stealth fighter. Circa 1980, NAFR received 806L \\"Range Threat\\" systems for electronic warfare simulation and from 1983 to 1985, the area of South Antelope Lake was used for two Tomahawk missile targets. NAFR range operations transferred to the 99th Range Group at the end of the Cold War (the range received various Radar Bomb Scoring electronic systems from Strategic Training Ranges, e.g., Nellis had 5 AN/MSQ-77s by 1994). In 1999 the range's land withdrawal was renewed and the unused portion of the original Tonopah Bombing Range was redesignated a Formerly Used Defense Site. In 2001, NAFR was renamed the Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR) and in October 2001, the range group personnel and assets for range operations transferred to the 98th Range Wing. In 2005, Indian Springs AFAF was renamed Creech Air Force Base and in 2010, the NTS was renamed the Nevada National Security Site. The NTTR had four tracts in the 2010 U.S. Census. In 2011, the 98th Range Wing was redesignated with the same name as the range (NTTR). === Area 51 Facebook Raid === In June 2019, a joke Facebook event was created rallying the public to storm the training range on September 20 that year, saying \\"Let's see them aliens\\". Over two million people responded as \\"going\\" to the event, with another 1.5 million \\"interested\\". The county commission chairman estimated that approximately 40,000 people would turn up on the 20th of September. On July 10, speaking with The Washington Post, Air Force spokeswoman Laura McAndrews said officials were aware of the event, and issued a warning saying that the area was \\"an open training range for the U.S. Air Force, and we would discourage anyone from trying to come into the area where we train American armed forces\\", adding: \\"The U.S. Air Force always stands ready to protect America and its assets\\". A public information officer at Nellis Air Force Base told KNPR that \\"any attempt to illegally access the area is highly discouraged\\". ==References== ==External links== * Category:Installations of the United States Air Force in Nevada Category:Proving grounds Category:Formerly Used Defense Sites in Nevada Category:History of Nye County, Nevada Category:Military installations established in 1940 Category:1940 establishments in Nevada ","title":"Nevada Test and Training Range"},{"id":"9074532","text":"is a Japanese actor.

Part 1 aired on October 8, 1979, with Part 2 airing one week later. The two episodes aired as a one-hour special during off-season reruns on May 12, 1980. As the title of the episode implies, these were the final two episodes to feature Gary Burghoff in his role as Corporal Radar O'Reilly. These episodes were originally intended to be aired as season seven's finale, but CBS and the producers convinced Burghoff to return for the beginning of season eight. To make up for his imminent departure, Burghoff received a special credit in the show's opening immediately following William Christopher's, which read \\"also starring Gary Burghoff as Radar\\". For the first three episodes of season eight, Burghoff’s absence was explained by Radar’s having been sent to Tokyo for some R&R.; In two of the three episodes, Burghoff made cameo appearances. In addition to Burghoff’s departure, these episodes marked the final appearance of Johnny Haymer in his role as Staff Sergeant Zelmo Zale. With the departure of Radar, Hawkeye Pierce, Margaret Houlihan, and Father Mulcahy were the only three characters left on the series who had any connection to the novel and film from which M*A*S*H was derived (with Henry Blake being killed off at the end of season three, Trapper John McIntyre discharged between seasons three and four, and Frank Burns being sent back to the States after indecent conduct on R&R; following Major Houlihan's marriage, at the start of season six). ==SynopsisPart I=== It is another typical night surgery session in the 4077th as the doctors and nurses work to save another new crop of soldiers injured in the field. However, events slowly unfold that turn the night toward the not-so-typical. As Hawkeye asks Margaret for a rib spreader, the power immediately goes out in the operating room. In the confusion caused by the power outage, Margaret accidentally catches one of Hawkeye's fingers in the rib spreader as neither one can see what they are doing. Hawkeye's finger is severely mangled and sprained in the incident. Acting company clerk Klinger is dispatched to the generator to find out what happened. When he sees his old rival Zale watching over the generator, he instantly assumes that Zale is to blame for the problem and cannot fix it, and he goes to try to crank up the camp's auxiliary generator only to find that it has disappeared somehow. A frustrated Klinger gets into another in a long list of arguments with Zale. While the two are arguing the primary generator breaks down, rendering it useless and the 4077th in the dark with no means of electrical power. Three concerns become immediate for the 4077th: the procurement of a new generator, a patient of B.J. Hunnicutt's with a stomach problem that needs round-the- clock treatment, and the camp's food supply, which is in danger of spoiling because there is no longer any refrigeration. Colonel Potter is able to take care of two of the three concerns immediately. First, to help B.J.'s patient, he jury rigs a Wangensteen suction device from two old pickle jars and a suction tube to relieve the patient's distress. He then organizes a smorgasbord for the entire camp and all the Korean civilians living in the area to get rid of the food. Although the unit succeeds in consuming the food and B.J.'s patient stays safe, Klinger is having problems finding a replacement generator, and the patient will need treatment with an electrical suction machine if he is to survive longer. Meanwhile, Radar is set to return to the 4077th when he is bumped from his scheduled flight. While Radar is waiting for another flight in the passenger air terminal at Tachikawa AB (Tokyo), he meets an attractive nurse named Patty Haven (Marilyn Jones),See IMDB. who is going home to Lancaster, Missouri. Radar is excited by this, considering that his hometown of Ottumwa, Iowa is close to Lancaster, and the two hit it off. However, before they can get anywhere, Radar is placed on another flight. After a promise to Patty to try to find her when he gets home (and a quick kiss), Radar leaves and begins his trek back to the 4077th. Radar's trip home is not an easy one, as some stranded GIs crowd into his jeep, and he decides to get out. He ends up riding home in a bicycle-driven cart, which gives him a stiff neck in addition to his being tired and hungry. Radar is not able to rest, however, as most of the 4077th staff greet him with problems upon his return. The most happy person to see Radar is his substitute, as Klinger had been having all sorts of trouble with the job and left the office largely disorganized. Although Radar wants to rest, take a shower and eat, he is cajoled by Col. Potter into helping Klinger acquire a generator, as it is believed that Radar, who over the years has become a master finagler, will be able to get one. Unfortunately, Radar quickly finds the same bad luck as Klinger; he dejectedly breaks the news of his inability to find a new generator to him at the officers' club. His bad day, however, is about to get even worse. As Radar drowns his sorrows at the club with his trusty Nehi Grape Soda (which he complains is warm), Col. Potter receives a wire from Radar's mother. He goes to the Swamp and somberly asks Hawkeye and B.J. if they have seen Radar. After being told that Radar is in the officers' club, Potter breaks the news to his captains that Radar's Uncle Ed, who helped to raise Radar and run the family's farm after Radar's father died, has himself passed on. Stunned, all anyone can say is \\"oy\\". Part One ends the next morning with Radar trying his best to do his work and cope with the family loss while also conversing with B.J., Hawkeye, Col. Potter, and Father Mulcahy. He mentions that a neighbor is going to help his mother with the farm until she can handle things herself. Col. Potter, aware that Mrs. O'Reilly is not in the best of health, decides that the best place for her son now is home to help out the family. He tells his company clerk to fill out for himself a DA-7 Hardship Discharge form which will be given top priority and ensure Radar that he will be home \\"in time for Sunday dinner.\\" Everybody congratulates Radar on his imminent discharge, but a confused Radar is not sure whether he should be happy. ===Part II=== Later in the day after receiving his hardship discharge, Radar is going through his belongings and finds various mementos of his service, including his Purple Heart, a photograph of his Uncle Ed, and a rectal thermometer Lt. Col. Blake gave him after his own discharge. Meanwhile, the office is still in disarray as Klinger has organized nothing and still has had no luck finding a generator. Despite pleas by Klinger to assist him, Radar refuses and tells Klinger that he is going to have to learn how to do the company clerk job on his own, mentioning that no one had helped him when he first came to the 4077th. Ultimately, Radar is guilted into helping Klinger by Major Winchester, who chides Radar's selfishness for being eager to leave for home while the 4077th is still without power. While Radar helps Klinger try to negotiate with a supply clerk for a generator (who, for some reason, wants a frozen custard machine in exchange), he hears choppers bringing incoming wounded. Radar improvises by ordering all available vehicles the man has sent to the 4077th. The vehicles arrive just in time for a rare outdoor surgical session, with the headlights from the vehicles used to light the area in front of the OR. The session is a success, and Hawkeye operates despite his injured finger. After the session, Col. Potter and Radar share a drink in his office as sort of a farewell toast. Radar, however, tells Potter that due to what he had put together and Klinger's inability to do the job, he is going to refuse the offered discharge and remain at the 4077th. Potter is disappointed, telling him that he is not making sense. The next morning, Hawkeye makes a more forceful attempt to convince Radar to go home. After repeatedly trying to repack Radar's suitcase, Hawkeye tells Radar that the 4077th no longer needs him. Radar points out that the camp still does not have power, that Klinger has not shown himself capable, and that even though Hawkeye says he wants to leave and hates it so much, he does not believe him because of how he worked through his injury. Hawkeye then reminds Radar of his responsibilities at home, but Radar tells Hawkeye to mind his business and not tell him how to live his life. In a last-ditch effort to procure a generator, Klinger receives a call from Sergeant \\"Hondo\\" McKee at I-Corps supply, who is willing to trade a generator for a case of Scotch. Shortly after Klinger arrives at I-Corps, Major Van Kirk from the 243rd Service & Supply pulls up and angrily demands the generator, complaining that most of the supplies he orders through I-Corps (including two other generators) turn up lost. Van Kirk also unknowingly blurts out in front of Klinger that his unit is operating on a backup generator that they had to pilfer from a MASH unit (presumably the 4077th). While Van Kirk and Hondo go to process the paperwork, Klinger sees the opportunity to turn the tables. He goes to dispatch and posing as Van Kirk's driver blackmails the clerk. With the new generator in tow, Klinger returns to a hero's welcome at the 4077th; Potter later remarks \\"I always knew he had the larceny in him.\\" On the heels of Klinger's coup fourré, Radar is now convinced the camp will survive without him and decides to accept his discharge. The day of his departure finally comes and Hawkeye stops by the office to take him to his farewell party in the mess tent, but right as it is about to begin the camp is inundated with incoming wounded. Radar's good-byes are rushed as the unit begins to move the wounded into the OR; Colonel Potter tearfully embraces him, Margaret blows him a goodbye kiss as she rushes off, Father Mulcahy blesses him, Winchester wishes him \\"the best in his bucolic endeavors,\\" and Klinger assures Radar he will make him proud as his replacement. As Radar will be stopping in B.J.'s hometown of San Francisco on his way home, B.J. gives him a package (and a kiss on each cheek) to give to his wife Peg and daughter Erin (who will be meeting him at the airport). He looks around for Hawkeye, but by now everybody has gone. Radar goes inside the empty, silent mess tent (decorated with banners and placards saying \\"WE LOVE YOU RADAR\\" and \\"GOOD LUCK RADAR\\"). Looking at the giant cake made in his honor, he licks the icing and grimaces at the taste. After saying goodbye to his beloved pets, Radar goes to the OR, but stops at the door. He watches the frantic surgery in progress until he is noticed by Hawkeye, who fires off a farewell salute to him (the second time he has done so). After returning the salute, Radar reluctantly boards a jeep and leaves the 4077th for the final time. After the OR session, Hawkeye, B.J. and Colonel Potter enter the Swamp to find something on Hawkeye's cot: Radar's teddy bear, which he had brought from home and kept in his office as a comfort. Hawkeye picks the bear up and, while looking at it, says sadly: \\"Good-bye, Radar.\\" ===Allusions=== In the following episode, \\"Period of Adjustment,\\" Radar's departure is revisited in events surrounding B.J. and Klinger. Klinger is still unable to perform the way Radar had and is catching hell from Col. Potter for it, and B.J. has gone into a depression over the fact that his daughter Erin, who was meeting Radar in San Francisco with B.J.'s wife Peg, mistakenly called Radar \\"Daddy.\\" Realizing that he's been missing out too much on his daughter's childhood, B.J. decides to drink his way out of the army and when told by Hawkeye that won't work, he destroys their still and decides to desert, punching out Hawkeye on his way. He eventually meets up with Klinger, who is having just as hard a time dealing with his own issues, and the two go on a drunken spree that ends with both of them trashing Col. Potter's office. Eventually Potter is convinced to ease off Klinger after having a discussion with Father Mulcahy, who reminds him that Radar had the same struggles when he began as company clerk. B.J. ends up breaking down in Hawkeye's arms, upset over the fact that Radar was the first person his daughter called \\"Daddy\\" and being unable to get that moment back. In the series' penultimate episode \\"As Time Goes By\\" (season 11, episode 15), as Margaret is collecting articles to place in a time capsule, Hawkeye adds Radar's teddy bear; he suggests the teddy bear should be allowed to stand for \\"all the soldiers who came here as boys and went home as men\\". ==Production notes== *The first cast member to be hired for the M*A*S*H TV series, Gary Burghoff became the last to leave, following the departures of McLean Stevenson and Wayne Rogers in 1975 and Larry Linville in 1977. He would later reprise his role as Radar twice; one was in a 2-part episode of AfterMASH, and the other was in an unsold TV pilot W*A*L*T*E*R, which featured Radar as a rookie police officer in St. Louis. *In the episode \\"War of Nerves,\\" Sidney Freedman correctly predicted that Radar would leave his teddy bear behind in Korea when he went home. *Prior to this season, Mike Farrell tried in vain to convince Burghoff not to leave the show, citing the lackluster television careers of Larry Linville and McLean Stevenson after their departures. ==References== * Category:M*A*S*H (season 8) episodes Category:1979 American television episodes ","title":"Good Bye, Radar"},{"id":"9074556","text":"Roujiamo being prepared Roujiamo or rou jia mo (), also known as rougamo, is a street food originating from the cuisine of Shaanxi Province and widely consumed all over China. ==Overview== The meat is most commonly pork, stewed for hours in a soup containing over 20 spices and seasonings. Although it is possible to use only a few spices (which many vendors do), the resulting meat is less flavourful. Some alternatives are also available. For example, in Muslim areas in Xi'an, the meat is usually beef (seasoned with cumin and pepper), and in Gansu Province it is often lamb. The meat is then minced or chopped and stuffed in \\"baijimo\\", a type of flatbread. An authentic baijimo is made from a wheat flour dough with yeast and then baked in a clay oven, but now in many parts of China, baijimo is made in a frying pan, giving a taste that diverges significantly from the authentic clay oven-baked version. Depending on the types of spices used to cook the meat and the way the bread is made, the taste of roujiamo can vary greatly from vendor to vendor. Roujiamo is not a full meal and is often sold in the form of combo with liangpi. It is found with regional modifications across China. Roujiamo is considered the Chinese equivalent to the Western hamburger and meat sandwiches. Roujiamo could be the world's oldest sandwich or hamburger, since the bread or the \\"mo\\" dates back to the Qin dynasty (221–206 BC) and the meat to the Zhou dynasty (1045–256 BC).

In late 2005, the Ministry of Education in Taiwan listed the phrase in an appendix to its online chengyu (idiom) dictionary; media reports on the listing surfaced in Taiwan and later Hong Kong in late January 2007, generating a controversy over the definition of chengyu in which academics and members of the public criticised the Ministry of Education. == The listing == The phrase san zhi xiao zhu appears in the Ministry of Education's Chengyu Dictionary in an appendix section entitled \\"Movies and Novels\\"; other entries in the same section include The Seven Year Itch (七年之癢) and Pinocchio (小木偶奇遇記). The term fulu in the URL is the romanization of 附錄, the Chinese word for \\"appendix\\". It was first posted in late 2005; the earliest appearance of the entry in the Internet Archive dates to November 3, 2005. A report by Taiwan's TVBS claimed to have discovered that the Ministry of Education had removed the entry from the main body of the dictionary and refiled it into an appendix after the controversy erupted; Original text: 杜正勝的說法和編輯委員剛好相反 事實上因為爭議太大，我們發現，上午以前，三隻小豬的確出現在網路成語辭典的正文裡，到了下午，才被拿掉變成所謂的「附錄」。 however, the entry had actually been present in the appendix from its earliest listing. The entry itself reads: : Children's story. There were three pigs in a forest, one carelessly build a house made of grass, another thought that a house of wood would be enough, and only the third pig diligently built a house made of bricks. A big wild wolf blew down the grass house in one breath, and the wood house in two breaths, and in the end the three pigs all had to hide inside the solid brick house before the big wild wolf gave up. Later, the phrase san zhi xiao zhu was borrowed to describe sound accomplishments which could only be achieved through diligence and avoidance of laziness. For example: \\"We have to remember the lesson of the three little pigs; since we are building a bridge today, we have to build a solid one.\\"Original text: 童話故事。森林裡有三隻小豬，一隻隨便的築了草屋，另一隻想木屋應該就夠了，只有第三隻用心築了磚屋。大野狼一口氣把草屋吹壞，兩口氣也吹壞了木屋，最後三隻小豬都躲在堅固的磚屋裡，大野狼才無可奈何。後來「三隻小豬」一語被借來形容多用心，不偷懶，才能有最堅固的成就。如：「我們要記取三隻小豬的教訓，今天既然要建橋，就要建最堅固的橋。」 The initial version of the entry contained an error attributing the story to Hans Christian Andersen; the error was left uncorrected for over a year, until media reports pointed it out in January 2007. == Objections and response == National Taiwan University professor Ho Ch'i-peng stated in an interview with Hong Kong newspaper Ta Kung Pao that the advantage of chengyu is that they have deep and well-known meanings behind them, but the Ministry of Education's decision to list terms like \\"san zhi xiao zhu\\" as chengyu was far too broad, since the terms could be subject to a variety of explanations. Internet users also insulted Ministry of Education head Tu Sheng-cheng, ridiculing his attempts to make example sentences using the phrase \\"san zhi xiao zhu\\", and describing him as a \\"fourth pig\\". In response to the criticisms, a Ministry of Education official pointed out that even though people are accustomed to thinking of chengyu as having passed through thousands of years of history, language is constantly being changed and updated, and the Ministry's goal was simply to widen the material they included in the dictionary to act as a reference for the public. == References == == External links == * Ministry of Education (Taiwan) chengyu dictionary Category:Chinese proverbs ","title":"San zhi xiao zhu"},{"id":"9074591","text":"La Thuile may refer to: * La Thuile, Aosta Valley, a commune in Italy * La Thuile, Savoie, a commune in France * Lathuile, a commune in France ","title":"La Thuile"},{"id":"9074605","text":"Polo Independent Order of Odd Fellows Lodge No. 197 is a historic Independent Order of Odd Fellows building located at 117 W. Mason St. in Polo, Illinois. The lodge was built in 1901-02 for Polo's chapter of the Odd Fellows, which was established in 1856; it was the fifth meeting place used by the chapter. Architects Charles Wyman Bradley and Frank A. Carpenter designed the building in the Classical Revival style. The brick building is divided into three bays, which are separated by brick pilasters on the upper floors. An egg-and-dart frame encircles the upper two stories. A parapet extends along the roofline; the parapet is topped by a corbelled pediment containing a medallion with the year of construction. The Odd Fellows met on the upper stories of the building until the 1990s; the first floor has historically been used as a storefront. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 6, 2004. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Ogle County, Illinois ==Notes== Category:Odd Fellows buildings Category:National Register of Historic Places in Ogle County, Illinois Category:Polo, Illinois Category:Clubhouses on the National Register of Historic Places in Illinois ","title":"Polo Independent Order of Odd Fellows Lodge No. 197"},{"id":"9074608","text":"Highway 35 is a paved undivided provincial highway in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. It runs from the US Border near Port of Oungre (where it meets United States Route 85) to a dead end near the north shore of Tobin Lake. Saskatchewan Highway 35 (SK Hwy 35) is about long. The CanAm Highway comprises Saskatchewan Highways 35, SK Hwy 39, SK Hwy 6, SK Hwy 3, SK Hwy 2 and U.S. Route 85. of SK Hwy 35 contribute to the CanAm Highway between Port of Oungre on the Canada – United States border and Weyburn. Mudslides, and spring flooding were huge road building and maintenance problems around Nipawin as well as along the southern portion of the route named the Greater Yellow Grass Marsh. Over 20 early dams were built until the problem was addressed with the Rafferty-Alameda Project on the Souris River and the construction of the Qu'Appelle River Dam which have helped to eliminate washed out roads and flooded communities. The highway through the homesteading community followed the Dominion Land Survey on the square until reaching the Saskatchewan River at Nipawin. The completion of the combined railway and traffic bridge over the Saskatchewan River at Nipawin in the late 1920s retired the ferry and basket crossing for traffic north of Nipawin. The E.B. Campbell Dam built in 1963 northeast of Nipawin created Tobin Lake, and Codette Lake was formed with the construction of the Francois-Finlay Hydroelectric dam at Nipawin. The railway/traffic bridge that formed part of Highway 35 was the only crossing utilized at Nipawin until a new traffic bridge was constructed in 1974. The new bridge then became part of the combined Highway 35 and 55 until the highway parts just east of White Fox. Highway 35 then continued north along the west side of Tobin Lake. The railway/traffic bridge continues to be utilized for one lane vehicle traffic controlled by traffic lights, and continues as the \\"old highway 35\\" on the west side of the river until it joins with the current Highway 35/55. ==Route description== Fort Qu'Appelle and Qu'Appelle, Saskatchewan Highway 35 connects with the major Saskatchewan Highways SK Hwy 18, SK Hwy 39, SK Hwy 33, SK Hwy 38, SK Hwy 1, SK Hwy 22, SK Hwy 15, SK Hwy 16, SK Hwy 5, 3, and SK Hwy 55. The major communities of Weyburn, Fort Qu'Appelle, Wadena, Tisdale, and Nipawin are en route. SK Hwy 35 has three distinct topographical areas when driving through Saskatchewan. The rolling moraines and valleys of the mixed grassland give way to aspen parkland. The aspen parkland encompasses both the Qu'Appelle River and the Quill Lakes saline water basin areas. The northern portion of the route is southern boreal forest which still features agricultural land with more heavily forested areas. ===CanAm highway=== The southern portion of SK Hwy 35 from the Canada–United States border to Weyburn forms the initial segment of the CanAm Highway. The terrain is mixed prairie featuring rolling moraines and valleys. North American Free Trade Agreement NAFTA super corridors are a concept of huge transportation corridors connecting Mexico, United States, and Canada. The CanAm highway was a concept begun in the 1920s. This area has been subject to criticism as the entry way to Canada of this route. \\"The CanAm matters so little to Saskatchewan highway planners that they've turned the most southern part of it within the province -- the Highway 35 link from Weyburn to the little U.S. border crossing at Oungre -- to gravel. SK Hwy 35 achieved a dishonourable mention in the Canadian contest entitled 'Highways from Hell'.SK Hwy 35 \\"Brenda Bakken Lackey called Highway 35 an “embarrassment’’ and a hazard for truckers’ business since it was turned into a gravel roadway last year[2004]. 'When it rains, there is mud and when it is dry, there is flying dust and gravel,' she said. 'Truckers from my constituency tell me that the U.S. Customs officials say they are not going to put up with the mud that is coming across on the trucks. There is also concerns about grain seeds and weeds coming across in the mud on truck tires.'...Highway Minister Maynard Sonntag said. 'Highway No. 6 has a much higher traffic count, many more trucks in and out from the States than Highway No. 35 would have.’' \\" \\"The projects on Highways 39 and 6 will help to improve traffic flow through these Canada/U.S. ports. 'Highways 6 and 39 are very important to Saskatchewan – serving as tourism links and major north-south trade corridors to the U.S.,' Sonntag said. \\"Highway 35 from Wadena South is always an adventure. I have found my driving skills have improved immensely especially when it comes to emergency braking and swerving to avoid the many areas of broken pavement. This past spring the Dept. of Highways could have saved thousands in signage costs if they only had put up warning signs where the road was smooth and unbroken.\\" The regional parks in this area are Nickle Lake, Mainprize, and Oungre Memorial as well as the Rafferty Reservoir. Fort Qu'Appelle Weyburn is the only city on SK Hwy 35 and has been dubbed the Soo Line City due its connection with Chicago on the Soo Line of the Canadian Pacific Railway CPR. The city of 9,433 people is situated on SK Hwy 35, SK Hwy 39, and SK Hwy 13. The small towns of Exon and Converge have been absorbed into the city of Weyburn today. Weyburn is located astride the Williston geological Basin which contains oil deposits, and several wells operate in the vicinity. Weyburn features roadside attractions of a large lighthouse water tower, wheat sheaves and prairie lily. ===Aspen parkland=== Fort Qu'Appelle. The Squirrel Hills are a topographical feature south of the Qu'Appelle River. The town of Qu'Appelle with a population over 600, had historic beginnings with fur trading posts in this area, and is located within the South Qu'appelle No. 157 rural municipality RM at the intersection of SK Hwy 35 with SK Hwy 1, the TransCanada. Qu'Appelle was first named Troy, and was an administrative centre of the North West Territories before Saskatchewan was incorporated as a province. The terrain changes from mixed prairie to aspen parkland and the frequency of trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) bluffs increase. Fort Qu'Appelle, with a population near 2,000, has a vibrant history being an early fur trading post south of Pasqua Lake and north of Fishing Lake, two of the Calling Lakes. Fort Qu'Appelle is located at the junction of SK Hwy 35, SK Hwy 10, SK Hwy 22, SK Hwy 727, SK Hwy 56, and SK Hwy 215.1897 Hudson’s Bay Company plaque in Fort Qu'Appelle The 1897 Hudson’s Bay Company store, 1911 Grand Trunk Pacific Railway station, Fort Qu’Appelle Sanatorium (Fort San), and the Treaty 4 Governance Centre are all landmarks of this community. A billboard and reconstructed Fort Qu'Appelle commemorate the history of the area where Treaty 4 was signed. The population of Elfros has dropped from about 300 residents in 1955 to 110 in 2006. It is located at the intersection of Hwy 16, the Yellowhead TransCanada. SK Hwy 35 traverses between the Little Touchwood Hills and Touchwood Hills area to the west and the Beaver Hills area on the east. Wadena at the SK Hwy 5 intersection hosts the Wadena & District Museum as well as the Jesmer & Milligan Marsh Projects Interpretative Center with information regarding the Quill Lakes International Shorebird Reserve. Ponass Lake, Barrier Lake, Marean Lake, and Tobin Lake all feature resort areas, with the largest attraction in this area being the Greenwater Lake Provincial Park. ===Southern boreal forest=== SK Hwy 35 The terrain which SK Hwy 35 travels through north of the Saskatchewan tree line is southern boreal forest marked by aspen combined with jackpine, tamarack and white spruce forested areas. The traffic count at the intersection of Hwy 35 and Hwy 3 at Tisdale is 11,200 vehicles per day. Tisdale is located in the heart of an agricultural community and honours the farming community with a big roadside statue of a honey bee, the land of Rape and Honey. The Nipawin Evergreen Golf Club has been rated amongst the top 100 golf courses of Canada. Nipawin is nestled between two created lakes, Tobin Lake and Codette Lake, hence its nickname \\"The Town on Two Lakes\\". The François-Finlay Hydro Station created Codette Lake in 1986. White Fox has honoured its namesake with a large white fox by the side of the road. The statue was built in 1995 as a \\"Welcome to the Village of White Fox, built by Families for Families, population 465\\". North of White Fox is \\"Tobin Lake, located 275 kilometres northeast of Saskatoon. Created in 1963 by the damming of the Saskatchewan River, Tobin boasts more than of sandy shoals, shallow bays and submerged timber.\\" The E.B. Campbell Dam can be accessed from the south east shore of Tobin Lake. SK Hwy 35 skirts along the north west shore of Tobin Lake, giving access to fishing locales from the highway access, such as Carrolls Cove Campground, Carol's Cove and Pruden's Point Resort, and Pruden's Point. Whereas, Scot's Landing is located on the Saskatchewan River. ==History== SK Hwy 35 The valleys of southern Saskatchewan have been subject to landslides. Most landslides occur in the Cretaceous shale formations many years ago following the receding of the continental ice sheet. In 1953, a rapid flow landslide destroyed a portion of SK Hwy 35 near Fort Qu'Appelle in the Echo Creek Valley. Weyburn is situated near the upper delta of the long Souris River. The Souris River continues southeast through North Dakota eventually meeting the Assiniboine River in Manitoba. In the 19th century this area was known as an extension of the Greater Yellow Grass Marsh. \\"Extensive flood control programs have created reservoirs, parks and waterfowl centres along the Souris River.\\" Between 1988 and 1995, the Rafferty-Alameda Project was constructed to alleviate spring flooding problems created by the Souris River. Buildings along SK Hwy 35 The rural municipality of Indian Head No. 156 contained amongst its communities Fort Qu'Appelle and South Qu'Appelle in the late 19th century and early 20th century. One of the early problems was spring flooding from the neighboring Qu'Appelle river when it overflowed its banks washing out bridges. 21 dams were built in the pioneering days to help with the yearly flooding. The steel bridge built over the Qu'Appelle river at Blackwood Crossing eased problems of communication and commerce immensely. The Qu'Appelle River Dam and the Gardiner Dam formed Lake Diefenbaker. The Qu'Appele River Dam is the origin of the Qu'Appelle River from whence it flows east to the confluence with the Assiniboine River in the province of Manitoba.. The Doghide / Leather River, and the Leather/Carrot River fork between Nipawin and Tisdale. These rivers have also contributed to spring flooding in the region. The historic Leather River Bridge is no longer being used but is an example of a steel truss bridge. The ferry was the first method of transport across the Saskatchewan River at Nipawin. A basket which was propelled above the river on wire could safely transport persons and mail across the river when travel was unsafe because of the ice break up. The CPR bridge opened to traffic in 1932, to be replaced by a steel bridge with concrete piers which was opened by the Saskatchewan Department of Highways in 1974. The highway runs south to north, and historically did not run on the square following both range and township surveyed road allowances, but rather was allowed to run straight and true along township roads for the most part. The road traveled parallel to the rail between Wadena and Nipawin. The Humboldt Broncos bus crash occurred on this highway at the intersection with Saskatchewan Highway 335 on April 6, 2018. ==Major intersections== From south to north: ==References== ==External links== *End of U.S. Highway 85 *Hillcrest Cemetery Weyburn, Saskatchewan *Junction of Highway #35 24 km North to Quill Lakes Bird Area *In God We Trust Elevator (near Nipawin) The Changing Face of the Saskatchewan Prairie Image Gallery: Private Elevators *Postcard Views of Southeast Saskatchewan *Saskatchewan Highway 35 pictures *Northeast Saskatchewan is a distinct trading area that includes the communities of Tisdale, Nipawin, Melfort, Hudson Bay, and Wadena *The town of Qu'Appelle - photos of sightseeing in Saskatchewan on .. ==Extra reading== Title: Homestead to Heritage, Author Armley History Book Committee, Publisher Friesen Printers, 1987 035 Category:Weyburn ","title":"Saskatchewan Highway 35"},{"id":"9074622","text":"The Immortals may refer to: ==Literature== *The Immortals (poem), by Isaac Rosenburg (1918) *The Immortals (Barjavel novel), a 1973 novel by René Barjavel *The Immortals (Hickman novel), a 1996 novel by Tracy and Laura Hickman *The Immortals (series), by Tamora Pierce *The Immortals (The Edge Chronicles), the final novel in the Edge Chronicles series *The Immortals (Gunn novel), a novel by James Gunn (author) * A book series by Alyson Noel beginning with Evermore (novel) ==Music== *The Immortals (punk band), Surf- Punk band from Huntington Beach California *The Immortals (band), a Belgian band * \\"The Immortals\\" (song), a 2011 song by American rock band Kings of Leon ==Other uses== *\\"The Immortals\\" (Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey), the eleventh episode of Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey *The Immortals (1995 film), 1995 action/crime/drama film *The Immortals (2015 film), 2015 Indian documentary film *The Immortals (neo-nazis), a neo-nazi organization *\\"The Immortals\\" (NCIS), an episode of television series NCIS *The Immortals (rugby league), an accolade bestowed by Rugby League Week magazine *Persian Immortals, an elite military unit of Ancient Persia *Immortals (Byzantine Empire), an elite military unit of the Eastern Roman Empire == See also == * Immortal (disambiguation) ","title":"The Immortals"},{"id":"9074624","text":"Les Éditions Doberman-Yppan (Doberman-Yppan) is a Canadian music publishing firm.

Philbrick co- authored his first book, The Backyard Lumberjack, alongside his father, Stephen Philbrick, in 2006. After graduating from Brown University in the spring of 2001, where Philbrick was an English major and a left-handed pitcher, Philbrick signed a professional baseball contract with the Albany- Colonie Diamond Dogs of the independent Northeast League.Crossman, Nate. \\"Giving It Another Shot.\\" Daily Hampshire Gazette. 26 Feb. 2002. Later that summer, Philbrick was released, but continued his career with the Berkshire Black Bears, who made their home at historic Wahconah Park in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. Having grown up in nearby Cummington, Massachusetts, Philbrick was a local favorite. After playing with the Berkshire Black Bears, Philbrick played in the Frontier League. In the spring of 2002, Philbrick retired from pitching and began work as an author and carpenter. Frank's first book, The Backyard Lumberjack is a how-to guide and personal account of managing a woodlot. Drawing on a lifetime of personal experience with forestry, farming, and woodworking, the Philbricks impart both the technical and emotional aspects of the firewood process, detailing each step from tree to stove. The Backyard Lumberjack also shares tales of life in the rural hills of The Berkshires. As part of the publicity for The Backyard Lumberjack, Philbrick appeared on the CBS Early Show, The Leonard Lopate Show on WNYC, The Arnie Arnesen Show, The Rachel Maddow Show on Air America Radio, Martha Stewart Living Radio on Sirius Satellite Radio, and The Playboy Radio Show also on Sirius Satellite Radio. Philbrick and his father, Stephen, also appeared on The History Channel show, \\"Modern Marvels: The History of the Axe\\" where, using only a sharpened axe, the father-son team were filmed cutting down a pine tree measuring six feet in circumference. The show aired on May 30, 2008. Publicity for The Backyard Lumberjack led to an unexpected foray into modeling. Magnum photographer Bruce Weber photographed Philbrick for a \\"L'Uomo Vogue\\" piece on American men's sports and Philbrick appeared in print and television advertisements photographed by Weber for the \\"American Living\\" ad campaign which aired during the 2008 Academy Awards. Philbrick subsequently appeared in the Rogues Gallery Spring/Summer 2008 lookbook. Philbrick's next book project is underway. Using an extensive diary he kept while playing ball, Philbrick is translating his time in the minor leagues into his next non- fiction novel. The Philbrick family has a strong literary and artistic tradition. Frank's father, Stephen, has published three books of poetry and is minister of the West Cummington Congregational Church. Frank's grandfather, Charles Horace Philbrick, was an award-winning poet and professor of English at Brown.Pamela Petro. \\"Tree Huggers.\\" Brown University Alumni Magazine. Jan/Feb. 2007. Frank is also a cousin of bestselling author, winner of the 2000 National Book Award, and 2007 Pulitzer Prize nominee, Nathaniel Philbrick, best known for his books, In The Heart of the Sea; Mayflower; The Last Stand; Why Read Moby Dick; and Bunker HIll: a City, a Siege, a Revolution. Frank's mother, Ann Leone, is a published author and a professor of French Studies and Landscape Studies at Smith College. Frank's cousin Clancy Philbrick is a contemporary American artist. Between writing projects, Philbrick works as a carpenter. Employing a technique dating back to Neolithic times, Philbrick designed and constructed two timber-framed barns - one in Berkshire County, Massachusetts and the other in Hampden County, Massachusetts. Philbrick also specializes in finish and restoration carpentry. In 2012, Philbrick, along with his fiancé and their daughter, moved from the Greenpoint neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York to his childhood farm in Cummington, Massachusetts. ==Books by Frank Philbrick== * The Backyard Lumberjack: The Ultimate Guide to Felling, Bucking, Splitting & Stacking.

He later played for Conference sides Telford United and Woking, before returning to the Football League with Bristol Rovers in 1997. After five seasons with Bristol Rovers, in which he made 237 appearances in all competitions, Foster was released by new manager Ray Graydon in April 2002 as Bristol Rovers sought to reduce their wage bill after finishing next to bottom of Division Three. Foster joined Doncaster Rovers in August 2002 on a short- term deal and then agreed a contract until the end of the 2002–03 season in the following October. He made 21 league appearance as Doncaster reached the inaugural Conference play-off final and won promotion to the Football League in May 2003. His performances were rewarded with a one-year contract in June 2003 and a new two-year contract in February 2004. He made 44 league appearances in the 2003–04 season as Doncaster won a second successive promotion, and 34 league appearances in the 2004–05 season, which was interrupted by a serious ankle injury sustained in September 2004. He made a further 17 league appearances for Doncaster in the 2005–06 season, before leaving the club by mutual consent in January 2006 and joining Scunthorpe United until the end of the 2006–07 season. He made 62 league appearances in the 2005–06 and 2006–07 seasons as Scunthorpe won the League One championship in May 2007, and he took the Scunthorpe United's official Player of the Year award. Foster was offered a new contract at the end of the 2006–07 season, but opted to join Darlington where he was reunited with his former manager at Doncaster, Dave Penney, and was named as captain for the 2007–08 season. In late 2009, it was discovered that Foster had a clause written into his contract, that qualified him for a new contract with Darlington, if he was to make just one more league appearance (not from the substitute bench) for the club. Because of Darlington's financial constraints Foster was sidelined to avoid the new contract being activated. And on 1 March 2010 Foster left Darlington to sign for Conference North club Blyth Spartans. Foster returned to his roots by signing a one-year deal with Mansfield Town on 28 May 2010. On 31 May 2011, it was announced that Foster's contract would not be renewed. Foster now played for Spennymoor Town in the Northern Football League between 2011–2012. In February 2014 Foster got named assistant manager of Northern League side Whitley Bay FC. == Honours  As a player === *Woking **FA Trophy winner: 1996–97 *Doncaster Rovers **Conference National Play-off Final winner: 2002–03 **Division Three Title winner: 2003–04 *Scunthorpe United **League One Title winner: 2006–07 ==References== == External links == * (Note: Soccerbase erroneously lists his birthdate as 1 October 1979) Category:1974 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Mansfield Category:Association football defenders Category:English footballers Category:Mansfield Town F.C. players Category:Telford United F.C. players Category:Woking F.C. players Category:Bristol Rovers F.C. players Category:Doncaster Rovers F.C. players Category:Scunthorpe United F.C. players Category:Darlington F.C. players Category:Blyth Spartans A.F.C. players Category:Spennymoor Town F.C. players Category:National League (English football) players Category:English Football League players ","title":"Steve Foster (footballer, born 1974)"},{"id":"9074701","text":"Kristen McMenamy (born December 13, 1964) is an American model. She is known for her unconventional, androgynous appearance. Originally a long-haired redhead, she reinvented her look in the early 1990s by having her hair cut short and dyed black, and her eyebrows shaved off. Her career was boosted by the advent of the grunge fashion trend. == Early life == McMenamy was born in Easton, Pennsylvania and spent some time growing up in Buffalo, New York. She was the third of seven children in an Irish-American Catholic family. As a student at Notre Dame High School, she received excellent grades, but was often teased by her classmates, who called her \\"Skeleton\\" due to her lanky body. While in college, she decided to drop out of school to pursue a career in modeling. After heading to New York City, she was rejected by various modeling agencies. She nonetheless continued following her dream to model. She later recounted, \\"I got rejected by everyone. But I was obsessed! It was the only thing I wanted to do and I wanted it so badly. I was like a bulldog, hanging on by my teeth.\\" ==Career 1984–1998: Beginnings and success === Upon meeting the modeling agent Eileen Ford, McMenamy was told to consider getting plastic surgery. Despite that, she managed to get signed by an agency that sent her to work in Paris, France. A few years later, she was signed by Elite Model Management, and subsequently by Ford Models. McMenamy's modeling career mainly spanned the years 1985 to 1998, when she worked for many of the world's top designers and international fashion houses, such as Versace, Giorgio Armani, Valentino, Todd Oldham, Christian Dior, Sonia Rykiel, Dolce & Gabbana, Jean Paul Gaultier, Gianfranco Ferré, Lanvin, Isaac Mizrahi, Yohji Yamamoto, Thierry Mugler, Comme des Garçons, Chloé, and Moschino. During the early stage of her modeling career, McMenamy met two of the men who would become instrumental in her success as a model: photographer Peter Lindbergh, with whom she worked extensively, and Chanel head designer Karl Lagerfeld, to whom she became a muse. One of her first fashion campaigns was for Chanel's spring/summer 1985 Haute couture collection. That same year, she was photographed by Lindbergh for a Jil Sander ad campaign, and she also starred in an ad campaign for the Byblos fashion house. In 1986, she was featured in the book A Day in the Life of America, photographed by Sante D'Orazio. She has also worked with many other fashion photographers, including Albert Watson, Helmut Newton, Richard Avedon, Steven Meisel, Ellen von Unwerth, Arthur Elgort, Paolo Roversi, Patrick Demarchelier, Jean-Baptiste Mondino, Tim Walker, and Juergen Teller. She became a muse to Teller, who has described her as \\"the best model I have ever worked with\\". In 1991, McMenamy starred in the ad campaign for Claude Montana's spring/summer collection, and was paired with model Claudia Mason for Fendi's fall/winter ad campaign. It has been said of McMenamy that \\"At the time of supermodels, she was the first eccentric and unusual beauty to fight her way through a host of classically beautiful women, thus appearing on the covers of Vogue and on other famous magazines.\\" Some of the other magazines that she has been featured in are Harper's Bazaar, Vanity Fair, People, Interview, Elle, V, Dazed & Confused, LOVE, i-D, The Face, W, Women's Wear Daily, and Newsweek. McMenamy was known for having an over-the- top manner of walking on the catwalk, and was likened to \\"a vamp, stopping to strike exaggerated poses\\". In 1992, after having her long red hair cut short and dyed black, makeup artist François Nars shaved off her eyebrows for Anna Sui's fall/winter fashion show, thereby \\"ushering in the era of grunge\\". The transformation of McMenamy's look made her famous, and her career took off. From that point on, her image became associated with androgyny, and she was also considered a gamine. In October 1992, she opened the Versace spring/summer 1993 womenswear fashion show, and she later appeared in the ad campaign for that collection, photographed by Avedon. In December 1992, she starred in a grunge photo spread for Vogue titled \\"Grunge & Glory\\", photographed by Meisel. Harper's Bazaar named her \\"Model of the Year\\" in January 1993. The following month, she had six red ribbons painted on her back, for an amfAR benefit event that she co-hosted with Leanza Cornett. McMenamy also fronted advertisements for Calvin Klein that year. In October 1994, she was one several models on the cover of Vogue Italia's 30th anniversary issue. The following year, she closed the Versace spring/summer Haute couture show wearing a bridal gown. She then starred in the ad campaign for that collection along with model Nadja Auermann and Elton John, photographed by Avedon. McMenamy and John later appeared together on the cover of the April 1995 issue of Interview. That same month, she was on the cover of Vogue. She was also featured in a chapter of the 1995 book The Beauty Trip. The following year, McMenamy was the star of an Absolut Vodka fashion campaign that was photographed by Newton in Sweden. Also in 1996, she posed nude with the word \\"Versace\\" written on her breasts and buttocks for a series of pictures that were photographed by Teller, which were published in the German magazine Süddeutsche Zeitung Magazin. In addition, she appeared in that year's Pirelli Calendar, photographed by Lindbergh. She was also one of the ten subjects of Lindbergh's 1996 book 10 Women. McMenamy was sometimes compared to supermodel Linda Evangelista because of certain similarities that they shared. Both of their careers skyrocketed after they dramatically changed their looks, and later, they both were considered \\"chameleons\\". They both were muses to Lagerfeld and Gianni Versace, as well as to Lindbergh and Meisel, with whom they often collaborated. In spite of their similarities, there were rumors that they didn't get along. They did, however, appear together in several magazine photo spreads and in two ad campaigns for Versace. In 1997, McMenamy appeared in advertisements for the fall/winter collections of both Versace and Armani. She was also featured in the book Fashion: Photography of the Nineties, in a series of pictures that were photographed by Teller. She then chose to step away from the modeling world in 1998 to focus on her family. === 2004–present: The 21st century === In 2004, McMenamy made a return to modeling by walking the runway for the Prada fashion house. That same year, she chose to stop dyeing her hair, and instead let it go gray. In 2005, McMenamy was booked by Marc Jacobs for his Fall 2005 campaign. In 2006, she appeared on the cover of the book In Vogue: The Illustrated History of the World's Most Famous Fashion Magazine along with Evangelista, photographed by Meisel. Then, in 2009, she was on the cover of the July issue of Vogue Italia, and the cover story had the words \\"McMenamy the Legend\\" as the heading. In the September 2009 issue of Harper's Bazaar, she wore no makeup for a feature story titled \\"Supermodels Supernatural\\". The following year, McMenamy modeled for the fall/winter 2010 Viktor & Rolf fashion show, in which she was a \\"Matryoshka doll\\", where the designers put several layers of clothing on her, similar to how the dolls have several layers. She also walked the runway for Klein's fall/winter 2010 fashion show. In August 2010, McMenamy appeared on the cover of Vogue Italia. The cover image and the accompanying 24-page photo spread, which was titled \\"Water & Oil\\", were said to be inspired by that year's Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. A controversy arose over the photo spread, particularly because in some of the pictures, McMenamy seemed to be emulating a bird covered in oil. Though, according to Franca Sozzani, Vogue Italia's editor-in-chief, the message of the photo spread was \\"to be careful about nature\\". In September 2010, McMenamy starred in a short fashion film for Gareth Pugh's spring/summer 2011 collection. A few days later, she closed the Louis Vuitton spring/summer 2011 fashion show wearing body paint that was intended to look like zebra stripes. In January 2011, she closed the Chanel Haute couture spring/summer fashion show. She also starred in the 2011 short film The Tale of a Fairy, which was directed by Lagerfeld.

The ruined Baron Hill House and the associated Baron Hill Park were established in 1618 by Sir Richard Bulkeley as the family seat of the influential Bulkeley family. Parts of the park are a site of special scientific interest. ==Baron Hill House== The original Baron Hill mansion was built by Sir Richard Bulkeley in 1618. During the English Civil War, Richard Bulkeley's successor, Colonel Thomas Bulkeley (later (Thomas Bulkeley, 1st Viscount Bulkeley), is said to have invited King Charles I to take possession of the house and set up his court there. In the early eighteenth century the house was the seat of Richard Bulkeley, 4th Viscount Bulkeley who maintained Jacobite sympathies. Baron Hill, Anglesey, the seat of the Bulkeley family, in 1776. Now a ruin. A colonnade in the grounds of Baron Hill The house was reconstructed in 1776 by architect Samuel Wyatt in a Neo-Palladian style as is obvious from the curved facade of the current ruined building to the terraces, follies and balconies. There is also an icehouse in the gardens and a lodge house. In the nineteenth century the occupants of Baron Hill remained the dominant Anglesey landowners, possessing estate also at Llanfairfechan and other parts of Caernarfonshire. During World War I, death duties soaked up the family fortune and made it impossible for the family (by then called Williams-Bulkeley) to continue to maintain the house. During the war, Royal Engineers were stationed at the house. In 1939 at the outbreak of World War II, the mansion was requisitioned by the government and used as a temporary housing for Polish soldiers. The Polish soldiers found the home too cold and decided to start a fire within the mansion so they would be moved to new housing accommodations. The fire destroyed a large part of the interior and the soldiers were removed from the house but only to tents on the Baron Hill Estate grounds. The mansion was abandoned afterwards and is still to this day. Sir Richard Williams-Bulkeley lives at neighbouring Red Hill. The Bulkeley Memorial (at ) was built on the crest of Baron Hill in 1875. A golf course was added in the 1880s, and Baron Hill Golf Club occupies non-woodland areas of the estate. In August 2008, plans were submitted to restore the house and turn it into luxury apartments. ==Baron Hill Park== Baron Hill Park is an area of parkland north of Beaumaris. It is part of the ancestral land-holding of the Bulkeley family and contains the ruins of the former ancestral home, Baron Hill. Some 112 Ha of parkland is a designated site of special scientific interest largely because the woodland has remained largely undisturbed over very many years and is now host to a very wide range of lichen species, mostly epiphytic on trees. The designation also reflected the species range of the lichens which are typical of a high-sunlight, low rainfall environment which is much more typical of southern England but is also characteristic of the benign micro-climate found in parts of Anglesey. This park-land is privately owned and does not have public access. It is within the Anglesey Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. ==References== ==External links== * Natural Resources Wales documents for Baron Hill Park *2008 photographs of house at www.welshruins.co.uk Category:Buildings and structures in Anglesey Category:Country houses in Wales Category:Houses completed in 1618 Category:Grade II* listed houses Category:Grade II* listed buildings in Anglesey Category:Beaumaris Category:1618 establishments in Wales Category:Parks in Anglesey Category:Sites of Special Scientific Interest on Anglesey ","title":"Baron Hill, Anglesey"},{"id":"9074749","text":"The is the Japanese system of promoting an employee in order of his or her proximity to retirement.BBC News (22 March 2016: Japan seeks alternatives to its pay system The advantage of the system is that it allows older employees to achieve a higher salary level before retirement and that it usually brings more experience to the executive ranks.

Franck's experience as a child in war-torn Nicaragua, the visual clash of New York's graffiti and an interest in the abstract expressionism movement played a major role in de las Mercedes becoming a visual artist. With a self-obtained education, straight from the aisles of the Mid-Manhattan Public Library, Franck de las Mercedes has emerged as one of the country's most prolific artists in recent years. Incorporating elements of photography, drawings, journal pages and text art, Franck creates frenetic paintings with energetic abstractions bursting with color. FdlM draws inspiration from his New York backdrop and the effect that time and the elements have on urban surfaces. Referencing past experiences, trauma and family relationships in real life and literature, he creates psychologically-charged imagery. In 2006, Franck initiated The Priority Boxes Art Project a peace initiative that has evolved into a movement now embraced by popular culture, mainstream media outlets, schools and art educators across America. From his small studio near the Hudson River, the artist ships abstractly painted, seemingly empty boxes with a label that reads: «Fragile, handle with care: Contains peace» to people around the world. The boxes aim to spark dialogue and challenge people to reconsider their ability to influence change and question the fragility, value and priority given to concepts such as peace. De las Mercedes has shipped more than 12,300 boxes to countries and cities across the globe from urban and rural America to Asia and South Africa. \\"The Peace Boxes\\" have traveled the globe, been taught in classrooms and featured on the iconic LED screens of Times Square. Franck and his work have been featured on numerous national and international television and radio shows including, LatiNation, CNN En Español, Noticiero Telemundo and Univision's \\"Aqui y Ahora.\\" He's also been featured in prestigious publications including, Selecciones (Reader's Digest), Art Business News, Hispanic Magazine, SoulPancake, Museum VIEWS, American Style and The Artist's magazine, Blick Art Materials' Spring 2013 Featured Artist, Town & Country, The Daily Beast and Good Day New York on Fox 5. FdlM's work has been exhibited in numerous solo shows and group shows around the world. In 2012, his portrait of Francisco de Quevedo was acquired by Fundación Francisco de Quevedo for their permanent collection in Ciudad Real, Spain. On Tuesday, February 18, 2014 a massive fire ripped through his home and the home of The FDLM Art Studio. Escaping the flames with only the clothes on his back, the fire destroyed his entire life's work and possessions. For 12 years, 217 Hackensack Plank Rd. was home to Franck and his wife Nicola, art studio and the birthplace of The Priority Boxes Art Project. His loft was completely destroyed, the building gutted and later demolished. Franck has since relocated to New York City.

These sandwiches are part of a system which eventually became known as the barbell strategy; a plan designed to expand Burger King's menu with both more sophisticated, adult- oriented fare along with products that are more value-oriented. This program is intended to bring in a larger, more affluent adult audience who will be willing to spend more on the better quality products on one side while maintaining a lower cost value menu dedicated to a more cost-conscious audience on the other. The hope is that the customers would be drawn in initially for the lower prices of the value-menu and upgrade to the more expensive products, upping overall sales. The chain's first major attempt was part of their Specialty Sandwich line that was introduced in 1979 was the Sirloin Steak Sandwich. After the failure of the Specialty Sandwich line, Burger King went on to introduce several other premium burgers made from a variety of meats. One major example introduced in 2002 was the BK Back Porch Griller sandwich line. The sandwich, introduced in May 2002 was a pronounced failure, and pulled in September of that year. The next product Burger King introduced was its Angus Steakburger which it began selling in 2004; it too had lack-luster sales due in part to the patty being pre-cooked. The sandwich was later reformulated as the Steakhouse Burger which used a thinner, flatter, fresh cooked patty. The Steakhouse Burger sandwich was eventually replaced with the Steakhouse XT/Angus XT burger, which used a new, thicker round patty among several other changes. This newer sandwich was made possible with the introduction of the company's new broiler systems which allowed varying cooking times and temperatures which in turn gave the company the ability to utilize fresh cooked, thicker patties in its sandwiches. Only variations of the sandwich that explicitly state \\"Angus\\" in the title are manufactured from meat from Angus cattle. In 2011, the company discontinued selling the product in the North American market, replacing it with the Chef's Choice burger. The Chef's Choice Burger was removed in 2012. 2014 saw the introduction of the newest attempt at introducing a premium burger to the company's portfolio with the introduction of the A.1. Ultimate Cheeseburger in North America. Internationally, the chain has introduced several lines of premium sandwiches. In New Zealand, the chain first introduced the BK Crown Jewels line which was based upon the Whopper, TenderGrill, and TenderCrisp sandwiches. The line was eventually replaced with the BK King's Collection menu of Angus-based sandwiches. It also sold Angus-burgers in Australia, the United Kingdom, and Ireland. In East Asia, the chains sells the Angus XT sandwich which is a variant of the Steakhouse XT. In Great Britain, the chain has also introduced a burger based on lamb and another based on Wagyu beef, while back in the United States it sold a turkey burger sandwich – all of which were limited time offerings (LTOs). To promote continuing interest in these products, Burger King occasionally released limited-time only (LTO) variants on its premium burgers that have different ingredients from the standard sandwich recipes. Being one of the company's major business strategies, these sandwiches have sometimes been the center of product advertising for the company. ==History North America ===  Sirloin Steak sandwich  The Sirloin Steak sandwich was introduced in 1979 as part of a menu expansion that in turn was part of a corporate restructuring effort for Burger King. During the mid-1970s, Burger King was having issues with its operations, franchises and image. In 1978, Donald N. Smith was hired from McDonald's to help restructure the corporate operations of Burger King to better compete against his former company as well as the then up-and-coming chain, Wendy's. As part of an operational overhaul he dubbed \\"Operation Phoenix\\", Smith reorganized the corporate operations of Burger King. He also initiated a development plan for a new product line that would become known as the Specialty Sandwich line. Development began that same year, and while the company found that the new product lines would add an approximate eight second delay to the production time of orders and would cost about $39 million in lost productivity, the product was introduced in 1979. Despite these possible sales losses and time issues, the new products were successful and the company's sales increased by 15 percent. Included in the new line was the Sirloin Steak Sandwich, a single oblong patty made of chopped steak served on a sub-style, sesame seed roll. It, along with the Original Chicken Sandwich, was one of the first attempts by a major fast food chain to target a specific demographic, in this case adults aged between 18 and 34 years, members of which were presumably willing to spend more on a higher quality product.  Back Porch Grillers  The Back Porch Grillers were introduced in 2002 as part of a plan to increase the company's sales ahead of the upcoming sale of Burger King from then owner Diageo to a group of investors led by Texas Pacific Group (TPG). In its press release announcing the product, Burger King stated the intent of the burgers was to evoke the taste of a grilled burger that one would cook at home. At the time of launch there were two flavors of the sandwich, the Homestyle and the Smokehouse Cheddar, both served on a \\"bakery-style\\" bun. A third type, the Black Stack BBQ Griller, was introduced as a product tie-in with Men in Black II two weeks later. Initial testing of the sandwich led to favorable scoring in customer surveys and a roughly 15% increase in sales without compromising the sales of other products such as the Whopper. Due to the favorable results in testing, the company pushed up the introduction of the sandwich nationally. However, the product was statemented into two variants due to the company's introduction of its new broiler line; these new broilers were designed to allow a greater flexibility of products with different cooking times and heat settings which allowed the company to sell thicker burgers that required more cooking times. At the time of the sandwiches' introduction, the new broiler units had only been introduced to about one tenth of its North American stores. In these stores the sandwich was made with a single, thicker patty; in those locations with the older units, the company used a pair of thinner patties in a double burger sandwich. The use of the thinner patties resulted in numerous customer complaints that the sandwich was dry and not as tasteful as the thicker patty version. The product was introduced at a point of massive change for the company; besides the new broiler system that was being introduced, the company was also adding an entirely new product holding system designed to improve the quality of its products. Burger King was also tinkering with its menu in regards to other products, adding the Griller and a new veggie burger sandwich along with changes to its grilled chicken offerings, onion rings and milkshakes. The company had high hopes for the product at the time of introduction; same store sales for the company had been falling for at least five years resulting in lagging market share and decreased customer counts. The failure of the product left a hole in the company's menu, leaving it without the premium product side of its barbell strategy at a point where parent Diageo was trying to build up the chain's value to maximize the profit in the upcoming sales to the Texas Pacific Group. This failure was part of a series of events that deteriorated the chain's financial performance and eventually forced Diageo to drop its selling price for the chain from to .  The Angus Burger  The Angus burger was first introduced into the North American market in 2004. The burger featured a seasoned, patty that was intended to have a \\"steak flavor\\". The sandwich was introduced at the height of the low-carbohydrate diet craze that was popular in the United States at the time, a trend that Burger King hoped to capitalize on. The chain also hoped to stave off competition from up-and- coming fast casual restaurant chains such as Panera Bread and Chipotle by adding a higher quality product. At the time of the introduction, the sandwich's price point was $3.29 – one of the highest-cost sandwiches the chain had introduced to that point. The sandwich was introduced in two varieties, but was supplemented with a two LTO varieties, one of which was a product tie-in with NBC's The Apprentice in 2005. The Angus burger was one of the company's important product lines, targeting a group of consumers the chain identified as the \\"Superfan\\"; a demographic of individuals that composed 20 percent of the chain's customers, but 50 percent of the sales volume. One of the issues related to the sandwich's failure was the fact that the patty it was using was precooked; the sandwich lacked the taste of a burger that was cooked from raw. While the burger was presented as a premium product, the meat texture was found not to be much different from that of the Whopper – a less- expensive sandwich that many customers preferred. Beginning in January 2008, Burger King began to phase out the Angus burger in the US with the intention of replacing the sandwich with a newer Angus-based product in the second quarter of 2008.  Steakhouse Burger  {style=\\"float:left; padding- right:.5em;\\" -  - } The Angus Steakhouse Burger was introduced in April 2008 as the replacement to the Angus Burger. The new burger featured a large, square shaped Angus beef patty with two permanent variants of the sandwich with an LTO version later that year. The burger was thinner than the Angus Burger because many of the Burger King locations still used an older model broiler to cook their burgers. The older model relied solely on a single chain with uniform cooking speed and temperature which restricted the thickness of meat patties. As a result, thicker patties such as the one utilized with the previous iteration of the sandwich needed to be precooked. In press releases and interviews regarding the sandwich, the chain claimed that the \\"Steakhouse Burgers offer the indulgence of an entire steak dinner at a fraction of the cost\\". While the regular variant was served with more traditional toppings, the Loaded Steakhouse garnered notoriety for its unusual main ingredient, mashed potatoes topped with crispy, fried onions and A1 steak sauce. Reviewers of the sandwich described the Loaded Steakhouse burger as disgustingly good, Meaty Jewel in Burger King's Crown, and that the ...topping is pretty weird. By October 2008, Burger King announced it had shown revenue growth in the United States despite the ongoing fiscal slowdown related to the financial crisis of 2007–08. According to the company, same store growth in the U.S. grew approximately 3.6% in part to sales of the Steakhouse Burger. Despite the profit, the company missed Wall Street's estimates by a penny per share which resulted in a 37¢ drop in the chain's share prices.  Steakhouse XT  With the introduction of the company's new broilers in the United States and Canada in 2009 and 2010, Burger King introduced the third generation of its premium burger sandwich that it called the Steakhouse XT burger, with the XT standing for eXtra Thick. This new sandwich supplanted the previous versions of premium sandwiches as the chains most expensive burger-based sandwich. Unlike the preceding two sandwiches, this version was not made from Angus beef, but was intended to draw upon its ingredients and size as it defining characteristic. A higher-end version of the Steakhouse XT was first introduced in 2009 at the company's new BK Whopper Bar restaurant concept located at Universal Studios Orlando priced at US$5.29. The regular versions were introduced in January 2010 once the company had finished deploying its new broilers in all of its North American restaurants. The new sandwich came in two permanent varieties and a LTO variant, all of which featured a new round, , thick patty and was priced at $3.99 to $4.49 depending on the variant. At its BK Whopper Bar restaurants, the company added several other varieties beyond the initial one introduced in 2009 that were all exclusive to the high- end concept. The product was the first national product tailored to the new flexible broilers, units that were designed to cook multiple types of products that have different cooking requirements. The sandwich came at a time when there was a great deal of animosity between the chain and its franchises over its Buck Double promotion, which was driving average checks and profits. The Buck Double had been running for since October 2010 to the introduction of the XT, eventually had taken upwards 10% of all sales in the restaurants – cannibalizing sales from other higher priced items. Combined with the ongoing economic downturn at the time, the value- oriented promotion had sent overall profits for the chain down by as much as 3.3%. The introduction was seen as a way to help stop the sales slide and prop up the chain's flagging sales. By mid-2011, the financial crisis was also still lingering and many chains, Burger King included, had moved to a discounting as a way to attract customers who were unwilling to spend money during tough economic times. The discounting fit into the barbell strategy as these deals would often encourage people to purchase more food, often at higher price points. The chain also introduced several LTO versions of the sandwich that featured ingredients such as cheese and jalapeños mixed into the patty; these newer style sandwiches were simply called the Stuffed Steakhouse Burgers. These burgers arrived at a $3.99 price point, and were deemed as a questionable introduction in the midst of hard economic times and extensive value-oriented promotions. The Steakhouse line was discontinued in 2012, approximately fourteen months after the company was sold to Brazil-based 3G Capital.  Chef's Choice Burger  {style=\\"float:left; padding-right:.5em;\\" -  - } The Chef's Choice Burger was introduced in October 2011 as part of plan introduced by new corporate parent, 3G Capital, to restructure the chain's operations. Introduced as part of 3G Capital's menu restructuring, the sandwich featured a new ground chuck patty, a new \\"artisan\\" bun and new, reformulated bacon. Burger King's revamped bacon replaced its former, poorly-rated pre-cooked bacon which company executive chef John Koch described as not delivering a \\"whole lot of bacon flavor.\\" The new bacon was thicker cut, with natural smoked flavoring and cooked in-house. The sandwich was designed to compete with McDonald's existing Angus Third Pounder line and Wendy's new Dave's Hot 'N Juicy Cheeseburgers. The sandwich was introduced with a single permanent variety, and two more variants introduced March 2012. The burger came at a point in the industry where fast casual restaurants were beginning to take a bite out of the industry as a whole. Burger King, and other chains, at first had not taken chains such as Five Guys and Smashburger as serious competition. Additionally, convenience stores such as 7-11 were also expanding their in-store foods with cheaper hot foods that challenged the lower end of the market. These two market trends had the effect of shaving sales from both ends of the menu, challenging the concept of the barbell strategy. As the chains tried to fight the encroachment of the competition from outside fast food industry, McDonald's and Wendy's chose to focus on their menus while Burger King focused its advertising on younger-skewing \\"superfan\\". The result was that the other two chains' sales grew by 26% and 9% percent respectively, while Burger King's remained flat. New owners 3G Capital response to this was to in turn revamp Burger King's menu, stores and image. Besides the Chef's Choice Burger, the company introduced products that emulated McDonald's such as oatmeal, ice cream and smoothies. Another way that the company moved in order to update its message was by dropping long time agency of record, Crispin Porter + Bogusky (CP+B). CP+B had been one of the major players in the superfan demographic targeting with its Burger King character-based commercials for several years. Beginning in 2012 chain moved its advertising program to the advertising firm of McGarryBowen to promote the sandwich through a new food-centric campaign. The advertising program and naming of the product is designed to add to the cache of the product by associating with the terminology with higher quality products.  A1 Ultimate Bacon Cheeseburger  {style=\\"float:left; padding-right:.5em;\\" -  - } The A1 Ultimate Bacon Cheeseburger is an attempt to add a premium burger to its North American menu. The sandwich was introduced in July 2014 as part of a new plan to introduce fewer products that are less complex in their construction. With the purchase of Burger King by 3G Capital, the company began a reorganization of its operations including its menu. The chain added several new sandwiches that added complexity to its kitchen, increasing service time and broadening product inventories. It also modified its menu on a quarterly basis. === Europe ===  The Aberdeen Angus burger  The Aberdeen Angus burger was introduced by Burger King in 2006 when it added the European version of its Angus sandwich to the menu in the United Kingdom and Ireland. The company was forced to remove the Angus sandwich from the menu in early 2013 following the European horse meat scandal. Although Burger King stated that no traces of horse meat had been found in their patties, they were processed in the same factory as some affected products and were withdrawn as a precaution. The European sandwich was reintroduced in mid-2014.  The $190 Burger  The $190 burger was a sandwich that featured Wagyu beef and was sold in June 2008 at one location in East London. The idea was to promote the company's commitment to food quality. The promotion was also a fund raiser as all proceeds were donated to a local British children's charity.  The Lamb Flatbread burger  In March 2012, Burger King became the first major burger chain to add a burger based on lamb when it introduced its Lamb Flatbread burger to its menu in the United Kingdom and Ireland. === New Zealand ===  Crown Jewels  The BK Crown Jewels line was developed by the Burger King franchisee in New Zealand, Tasman Pacific Foods, abbreviated TPF. The sandwiches were introduced in the summer of 2005 as part of Burger King's global program to introduce more adult oriented fare to its menu. The products themselves were variations on the existing Whopper, TenderCrisp and TenderGrill sandwiches and featured more exotic ingredients such as mango lime salsa, avocado and garlic aioli. Within two months of their introduction, sales at New Zealand restaurants increase by approximately 10%, and drew the attention of Burger King Holdings. BKH observed the sales trends and market acceptance of the products for several months after the introduction for the possible purpose of extending the concept in other markets. While the concept was tailored for the New Zealand market, TPF executives stated that it would be easy to adapt the concept to other regions. Some restaurant industry observers agreed with the TPF assessment of the products and separately stated other sauces and ingredients could be used to crate variations in the US and other markets. Eventually, the sandwiches were discontinued, with the Sweet Ride and Mango Jammin burgers the first to be removed from the menu.  Product variants  All of the BK Crown Jewels sandwiches are served on a Kaiser roll; the beef based sandwiches use a Whopper patty and the chicken ones use a TenderCrisp or TenderGrill fillet. * Burgers ** Hell Raiser – The Hell Raiser has bacon, relish, aioli, avocado (guacamole), lettuce, tomato and onions. ** Blazing Saddle – The Blazing Saddle features bacon, relish, aioli, a Cajun spiced sauce, lettuce, tomato and onions. ** Sweet Ride – The Sweet Ride sandwich is made with a Whopper patty, bacon, aioli, a mango-lime sauce, avocado (guacamole), lettuce, tomato and onions. * Chicken ** Blast Off – The Blast Off Crown Jewel sandwich has a TenderCrisp fillet and shares the same toppings as the Hell Raiser minus the aioli. ** Cracker Jack – The Cracker Jack Crown Jewel sandwich has a TenderCrisp fillet and features the same toppings as the Blazing Saddle minus the aioli. ** Mango Jammin – The Mango Jammin sandwich has a TenderGrill fillet and is made the same toppings as the Sweet Ride minus the aioli.  King's Collection  The King's Collection was first introduced in 2010 in response to a new line of Angus-based sandwiches from McDonald's New Zealand. The new sandwich line was part of a co-branded partnership with AngusPure, an Australian brand of grass-fed, organic beef, and condiment supplier Heinz. === Asia === In Hong Kong, Burger King sold the Angus XT Black Truffle burger. === Competitive products === As the success of the barbell strategy became evident to the general market place, other chains such as McDonald's and Carl's Jr./Hardee's began to experiment with the concept. Introduced in 2001, Carl's Jr./Hardee's sells its Six-Dollar Burger, a line of sandwiches that is also made from Angus beef. In the United States, McDonald's introduced its own Angus Third Pounder sandwich in 2009. They were removed from the menu in 2013 and replaced with new variations on its Quarter Pounder sandwich. == Advertising  North America === * Dr. Angus – Dr. Angus was a CP+B creation launched in 2004 to promote the new Angus line of Sandwiches. Played by comedian Harry Enfield, the character is a smarmy self-help \\"doctor\\" with gleaming white teeth and a starched toupee who encourages eaters to \\"sit down\\" and enjoy the BK's large Angus burgers. In 2006, the character was again used to advertise BK's new Cheesy Bacon Angus and TenderCrisp sandwiches. In addition, CP+B added a viral marketing web page The Angus Diet. Designed to work with the larger Angus campaign, this site featured the such things as the Angus diet testimonials, a faux diet book and Angus interventions. The \\"interventions\\" could be sent to people via e-mail by filling out several fields on the page. As CP+B stated: \\"They were a way of getting people to spread the idea of the basis of the Angus Diet – just enjoy life. Do whatever you want. Eat whatever you want as long as it makes you happy.\\" * The Western Barbecue Angus – In a cross promotion with the 2005 season of the Apprentice, the two teams, Magna and Net Worth, competed in a contest to design a sandwich for BK to sell. The winning product was the Net Worth team and their \\"Western Angus Steak Burger\\". As a promotional stunt, the new sandwich was introduced as a nationwide, limited time offering the day after the episode aired. * Steakhouse (1st campaign) – The first line of advertisements for the Steakhouse Burger tagged the sandwich as \\"the burger you just can't wait for.\\" The commercials often featured people in a rush to get to Burger King and purchase a Steakhouse Burger, risking the safety of other people and property around them in the process. * Steakhouse Burger (2nd campaign) – The second line of advertisements for the Steakhouse Burger tagged the sandwich as \\"so special, people might think you think you're special.\\" The commercials imply that the Steakhouse Burger is a burger that people have to \\"earn the right\\" to eat. They usually feature two characters each enjoying the burger. They are then approached by a third character, who asks what the other two characters did to earn the sandwich. The first character boasts of an extraordinary feat, while the second character says he was \\"just hungry\\" or \\"just wanted one.\\" The third character then berates the second character, calling him arrogant for eating a sandwich that he \\"did not deserve.\\" === Europe === The Angus burger adverts featured a man (played by Richard Bennett) asking for an Angus Burger in a 'FastBurger' restaurant – a parody of McDonald's – and the counter staff laughing, presumably because they didn't think you could buy one in a fast food restaurant. The news of the order reaches the FastBurger headquarters and everyone associated with the fictional chain is laughing. The chairman is by now laughing after being told about the order on the phone, and says \\"An Angus Burger, is he crazy?!\\" An assistant gives him the Evening Standard paper and the front-page story reads 'Burger King Debuts The Angus\\". Then the camera pulls back through the office to reveal a real Angus Burger and the announcer says \\"The Angus Burger, only at Burger King\\". === New Zealand === The advertising program for the Crown Jewels sandwiches featured the slogan Flash, but not too flash which was an inference stating while they cost more than the standard burger offerings at BK, they were not as much as one would expect to pay at a higher end outlet. The products were introduced in a series of three pairs of commercials in both 15 and 30 second formats. The commercials featured animals such as snails or frogs that are used as exotic cuisine in various regions of the world. As the narrator announces BK is looking for new and more complex ingredients for their new line of sandwiches, the animals are shown reacting in a fearful way believing they are the new ingredients. At the end, the narrator declares one of the new flavors and the animal is relieved to find out they are not food, then they are promptly dispatched by the new food item (e.g. the frog is hit with a mango). == Trademarks == Burger King currently does not have any trademarks on the Angus line of sandwiches in the US, Canada, Europe or South Korea. == See also == * Whopper * Angus cattle * BK Burger Shots == Notes == Trademark information ; ; ; ; ; == References == Category:Burger King foods Category:Hamburgers (food) Category:Products introduced in 2004 Category:Products introduced in 2005 Category:Products introduced in 2006 Category:Products introduced in 2008 ","title":"Burger King premium burgers"},{"id":"9074783","text":"Thomas Bulkeley, 1st Viscount Bulkeley (1585–1659) was a landowner from North Wales who supported the Royalist cause during the English Civil War.Welsh Biography Online The son of Sir Richard Bulkeley of Beaumaris and his first wife Mary Burgh, daughter of William, 2nd Baron Burgh, Thomas Bulkeley was a colonel in the Royalist army and was created Viscount Bulkeley of Cashel in the Irish peerage in 1644.

It lies in historic province of Lesser Poland, approximately north-east of Kazimierz Dolny, south of Puławy, and west of the regional capital Lublin. The village has a population of 1,000, and is located on the right bank of the Vistula, on the road between Puławy and Kazimierz Dolny. The ruins of a 14th-century castle are located nearby. Bochotnica, which in the past was also called Bochotnica Mała (to distinguish it from nearby Bochotnica-Kolonia, or Bochotnica Wielka), is one of the oldest settlements in Lesser Poland. In the early years of the Kingdom of Poland, it was an important gord, located along merchant route from Kievan Rus towards central Poland. It now is a local tourist center, due to the picturesque Lesser Polish Gorge of the Vistula and proximity of Kazimierz Landscape Park. The village does not have a rail station, the nearest one is located at Puławy. It is a local road junction, where three roads meet. Even though no documents exist to prove it, Bochotnica already was a defensive settlement in the 6th century. This was confirmed by archaeologists, who in 1993 found here remains of the gord, together with a pagan cemetery and several artifacts, such as bronze and iron tools, gold coins and a 10th-century sword. Together with neighboring Wąwolnica, Bochotnica was a local administrative center. In 1317, King Władysław Łokietek handed Bochotnica and other local villages to brothers Ostaszko and Dzierżko from Bejsce (Lewart coat of arms). The defensive castle at Bochotnica was erected probably in 1340, after a devastating Tatar raid of Lublin Land. The stronghold was rectangular shaped, located on a hill, which provided it with a good view of the area. In the 15th century, the castle belonged to the Kurowski family, then it passed into the hands of Voivode of Lublin, Jan Oleśnicki, who changed his last name into Bochotnicki. On his initiative, the castle was remodeled in Renaissance style. Bochotnicki died childless, and after his death, in the late 16th century, the castle began to turn into a ruin. The village belonged to several families (Borkowski, Tarło, Lubomirski, Sanguszko, Potocki), and in 1826 it was owned by Adam Jerzy Czartoryski, whose properties were confiscated by the Russians as a punishment for November Uprising. In 1886, new owner Józef Klemensowski, briefly considered reconstruction of the castle, but changed his plans. Until the Partitions of Poland, Bochotnica belonged to Lesser Poland’s Lublin Voivodeship. In 1815, it became part of Russian-controlled Congress Poland, and after World War I, it returned to Poland. On November 18, 1942, German occupiers murdered 45 people at local town square, as a reprisal for attack on a German patrol. After World War II, Bochotnica was a center of anticommunist resistance. On May 24, 1945, a battle between ex-Home Army unit and the NKVD took place, in which 16 Soviet agents and 10 Polish Communist collaborators were killed. ==References== ==External links== *Photographs of castle ruins Category:Villages in Puławy County ","title":"Bochotnica"},{"id":"9074798","text":"Manjampatti Valley is a protected area in the eastern end of Indira Gandhi Wildlife Sanctuary and National Park (IGWS&NP;) in Tirupur District, Tamil Nadu, South India.

The earliest known residents of the area are the Palaiyar (meaning \\"old ones\\", incorrectly translated as Paliyan), a Tamil-speaking tribal people, who have been seen in the past 35 years living in small caves in the valley. Historically close extended Palaiyar family groups foraged and hunted at least 128 forest species for subsistence. In the past century they increasingly depended on shifting cultivation and collection and trading of non timber forest products of over 60 species for: food (14), incense & toiletries (11) medicines (13), construction materials & precious woods (9) and miscellaneous (13) honey, tubers, fruits, herbs, flowers, bark, seeds, fibers, gum, leaves, logs and oils. Since establishment of the IGWS&NP; in 1976, Palaiyar trading was gradually but severely restricted. They are now allowed to collect only tamarind from one small area outside Manjampatti Valley. Their strong cultural ties to the area and traditional avoidance of outsiders keeps them attached to their forest habitat. They must now depend on intermittent plantation labor, primitive low yield cultivation in restricted areas, liaisons with forest product smugglers and poachers, government programs and charity.\\"Tribal Development in India: A Case Study\\", Soundarapandian M., Anmol Publications PVT.

Most of the people are Pulaiyar caste, early cultivators, but there are some Malaimarasar tribal people, who do agriculture and coolie work. Ancient Ganesha statue at site of ruined Kondaiamman Temple This place had some importance in medieval times, as there are mounds with 15th century ruins of a Vijayanagar Dynasty p. 267 Kondaiaman temple with a substantial temple tank, and numerous scattered stone carvings and broken statues of goddesses such as Kondaiamman and Mariamman and gods Ganesha, and Krishna, with some text inscriptions. The villagers say they know no history of the temple. The village is a ward under the Manupatti Panchayat near the Amaraavathi dam, but the people have decided to not elect a representative. They do rely on the Forest Department for many kinds of assistance and advice. When the British created the Amaravathi Reserved Forest they allocated to the village for cultivation. This was divided up among families by stone boundary markers, which still exist, but land titles were not given. Talinji houses with solar lighting Thalinji people cultivate rice (monsoon crop) and butter beans and no other vegetables or crops. They keep a few cows, buffaloes, goats, and chickens. They are allowed to collect minor forest products for their own use, but not to sell. There is a one-room Anti-Poaching Camp used intermittently by forestry staff on their rounds. There is a school with a teacher posted, and a doctor is supposed to come every week but actually comes less than once a month. Men sometimes go out to work in sugarcane fields on the plains, and women go to work in the Manjampatti fields. Thalinji has no store or tea shop. The people do not integrate well in the modern society and economy, though they have accepted Photovoltaic powered home lighting devices from the District collector. ===Manjampatti=== Fields and house at Manjampatti village Manjampatti village at , near the middle of the valley has 59 households with 191 persons (95 males and 96 females) dispersed among its many agricultural fields located inside a bend of the Ten Ar just below its junction with the Kumbar and Manalaar streams. It is ethnically more diverse than Talinji. Pulaiyar were the majority inhabitants of Manjampatti when the British gave land to the village for cultivation. About 15 families of Muthuvar, another \\"tribal\\" group, live in Manjampatti village where they do cultivation and labor work. Some Theivar people, a widespread plains agricultural jaathi (caste), came to live in Manjampatti long ago and engage in agriculture on the village lands. There are also a few houses of other plains jaathis such as Chakkliyar (originally leather-workers). Because of these jaathis, Manjampatti village has some features of plains Tamil villages such as eating of newer types of vegetables and having tea shops. Manjampatti comes under the Mannavanur Panchayat and sends its Ward Member up to the monthly meetings. The people receive no benefit from the Panchayat, and prefer to rely on the Forest Department. Manjampatti falls under Kodaikanal Taluk office, and the people must travel far to Kodaikanal for official services such as getting a ration card. The ration items (rice, sugar, kerosene) are sent to an agent on the Amaravaathi-Munnar Road (SH 17) where the people go to collect them. The village has a small part-time general store selling cooking items and two part-time tea shops. There is a basic primary school of a type designed for tribal people, which is able to provide Transfer Certificates (TC) to students. Forest Department Anti-Poaching Camp There is a Forest Department Anti-Poaching Camp with four full-time staff. There is a polling station at the Hydro Matric Survey Building in Manjampatti for all voters from Manjampatti, Muthuvankudi and Mungilpallam (Mannavanur (r.v) Ward-5).R.Vasuki, I.A.S., District Election Officer & District Collector, 16/07/2008, Dindigul, List of Polling Stations for 127 Palani Assembly Segment within the 22 DINDIGUL Parliamentary Constituency, Polling station No. 205 The village has a Moopan (headman), assisted by a group of elder men, who organizes activities such as maintaining irrigation channels and resolving disputes, but this position is not recognized in the Panchayat system. The Moopan can be of any caste, and serves as long as he has the confidence of the people. If someone commits a serious crime, the Moopan will turn the suspect over to the Forest Department, which will arrange for him to be detained by police on the plains. Manjampatti was given land for cultivation when the Reserved Forest was created and the families have kept their respective fields marked with the original stone boundaries. Villagers earlier practiced shifting cultivation, growing millets such as raagi, thinai and kambu. Later the Forest Department forbade shifting cultivation and restricted cultivation to the allotted lands. The crops now are rice in rainy season and butter beans otherwise, though with a more diverse population a few vegetables such as eggplant and tomatoes are grown. Farmers here have to protect their crops from wild elephants, gaur, wild boar, deer and sometimes peacocks. A complex and well maintained system of small canals distributes water from the Manalar to irrigate the fields. Muduvankudi is a neighboring village inhabited by Muduvar (Muthuvar), and is a 15-minute trek from Manjampatti. ===Mungilpallam=== Mungilpallam villageMungilpallam (Moongilpallam) village at , at the headwaters of the TenAr, the third village going up the valley, is a hamlet of just 20 houses of Pulaiyar people (pop: m-22, f-18), on the north side and above the Kumbaar stream. They practice some shifting cultivation on their south facing slope. There is a steep cliff trail from here which leads east to Kumboor village at the end of the road from Kodaikanal. There are 24 Muduvan and Paliyan families living there. They were said to have migrated from Manjampatti 200 years ago because of their fear of herds of wild elephants. They originally lived in caves. They eat wild roots, maize, fruits from wild plants, honey and bamboo rice. Their limited income comes from selling bamboo products and lemon grass oil, which they spend to buy rice from other villages. These people are nature worshippers. They do not worship regularly or have a particular place of worship but have a sacred area in their village. They visit this area to celebrate the harvest festival Pongal and the rain (Mari) festival, during which they sacrifice a goat. They believe that diseases are manifestations of punishment inflicted by God. Till recently they only took native medicines. A witch doctor from the community was summoned for assessment and further treatment of serious illness. If the witch doctor's said the patient would die, food and medicines were withdrawn and the patient kept in a small hut away other until he or she died. In 2005, more than 50% of the children here suffered from severe chronic malnutrition.Medhaug Endre, Faculty of Medicine, Trompso, Norway, Malnutrition in the Children around Kodaikanal, Tamil Nadu, India June 2005, p. 35 Inside the Mungilpallam school Since 1995, a registered Christian charity \\"Tribal Education and Medicare Vision\\" (Team Vision) has assisted the villagers to get identity cards and ration cards from the Revenue Department and Civil Supplies Department. Also, corrugated steel sheets were provided for home roofing. 18 new huts were erected in a new location in 1999. The Forest Department helped the villagers lay stones on the tortuous way to the village. They also erected two solar lamps. A kindergarten school was started and 20 children were enrolled in 1998.

From here the ridge drops to the Amaravathi River.Department of Science and Technology, Survey of India, Topographical map, Amaravathi Range, scale 1:50,000 The western ridge of Manjampatti Valley extends 2 km into the easternmost area of Idukki District, Kerala and adjoins the 90 km2 Chinnar Wildlife Sanctuary. ==Rivers== The Manjampatti Valley catchment basin drains into the Chinnar River from the Athioda Stream and to the Amaravathi River from the Kajadaikatti Odai Ar and Ten Ar Rivers to the east. Athioda Stream NW of Talinji Athioda is the north to south political and physical boundary for between Tamil Nadu and Kerala between the end of the Pambar River and the top of Jambumalai peak at the trijunction of Coimbatore and Dindugul Districts and Kerala State. (This peak is locally known as Chinna Chambu Malai). The top of the ridge to the west above Athioda is the western limit of the catchment. Thus, the western edge of Manjampatti valley extends up to 2 km into Kerala. Athioda stream joins the Pambar River at the point they both join the Chinnar River at the north west corner of the Valley. West of this point, the Chinnar River forms the boundary between the Indira Gandhi National Park in Tamil Nadu and the Chinnar Wildlife Sanctuary in Kerala. East of this point, the Chinnar river becomes the Amaravati River in Tamil Nadu. Ten Ar River at Talinji The Ten Ar River is fed from most of the valley by the Kumbar stream, the Manalaar River (\\"sand river\\"), the Kalyanivalasu Odai and other smaller tributaries from the higher forests and sholas to the east. At the northwest end of the valley, the Ten Ar is joined by the Varavandi Odai stream flowing from a smaller adjacent valley to the east and soon joins the Amaravati River down stream to the west. The Amaravati River then flows north to the Amaravathi Reservoir and Dam and then to the Cauvery River. The Kudiraiyar River basin, including Kukkal village, is just over the northeast ridge of the valley behind Vellari Malai. ==Wildlife== Indian tiger Manjampatti Valley currently supports stable breeding populations of several large mammal species including apex predators critical to healthy populations of smaller animals. In colonial times Indian tigers (Tamil: puli or புலி ) were common in this area and as recently as the 1950s the Raja of Puthukkottai would go out from his house in Kodaikanal and hunt them. At least one tiger has been shot here within the past fifty five years.Sherman Marcus Manjampatti Valley Notes , (2007) Two tigers, a male and a female, were sighted and recorded in the 2007 wildlife census. Tiger populations in the adjoining areas of IGWS&NP; and the nearby Kalakkad Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve could expand back into this area if they and their prey species were better protected. The census estimated 10 to 20 panthers (Tamil: sirutthai) living in the Manjampatti Valley. Wild Indian elephants roam over the whole valley. Sloth bears (Tamil: karadi) are sighted every year in the upper forests of Manjampatti valley. Nilgiri tahr (Tamil: varaiaadu) live especially on the spectacular high rocky peaks around the valley, as Mudimalai, Jambumalai, and Attumalai, though they may also be seen in the valley forests. There are several herds of gaur (popularly called bison) (Tamil: kaattu erumai, \\"forest buffalo\\") in the valley. Earlier the area was well known for Manjampatti white bison. This possible sub-species has recently been seen and photographed here by Forest Department staff. Unidentified at 1,700 m Wild boar (Tamil: kaattu panri) live all over the Palani Hills (Tamil: பழனி) and in Manjampatti Valley, where one can frequently see holes in the ground where they have dug for edible roots. The valley has the large mountain squirrel (Tamil: malai-anil) and the ash-colored squirrel (Tamil: saambalnira anil). There are wild peacocks, jungle fowl, and many other bird species enumerated in the Wildlife Census. There are no known studies of the many reptiles, amphibians, insects, invertebrates or plants living in the valley. ==Visitor information== Manjampatti valley is a core zone of the Indira Gandhi National Park. Tourism, hiking, camping and non- resident visitation of the villages is prohibited. A permit is required for serious researchers to work inside the valley.

That is, a determiner may indicate whether the noun is referring to a definite or indefinite element of a class, to a closer or more distant element, to an element belonging to a specified person or thing, to a particular number or quantity, etc. Common kinds of determiners include definite and indefinite articles (like the English the and a or an), demonstratives (this and that), possessive determiners (my and their), cardinal numerals, quantifiers (many, all and no), distributive determiners (each, any), and interrogative determiners (which). ==Description== Most determiners have been traditionally classed along with either adjectives or pronouns, and this still occurs in classical grammars: for example, demonstrative and possessive determiners are sometimes described as demonstrative adjectives and possessive adjectives or as (adjectival) demonstrative pronouns and (adjectival) possessive pronouns respectively. These classical interpretations of determiners map to some of the linguistic properties related to determiners in modern syntax theories, such as deictic information, definiteness and genitive case. However, modern theoristsAccording to the OED (Second Edition), the word determiner was first used in its grammatical sense by Leonard Bloomfield in 1933. of grammar prefer to distinguish determiners as a separate word class from adjectives, which are simple modifiers of nouns, expressing attributes of the thing referred to. This distinction applies particularly in languages like English that use definite and indefinite articles, frequently as a necessary component of noun phrases – the determiners may then be taken to be a class of words that includes the articles as well as other words that function in the place of articles. (The composition of this class may depend on the particular language's rules of syntax; for example, in English the possessives my, your etc. are used without articles and so can be regarded as determiners, whereas their Italian equivalents ' etc. are used together with articles and so may be better classed as adjectives.) Not all languages can be said to have a lexically distinct class of determiners. In some languages, the role of certain determiners can be played by affixes (prefixes or suffixes) attached to a noun or by other types of inflection. For example, definite articles are represented by suffixes in Romanian, Bulgarian, Macedonian, and Swedish. (For example, in Swedish, ' (\\"book\\"), when definite, becomes ' (\\"the book\\"), while the Romanian ' (\\"notebook\\") similarly becomes caietul (\\"the notebook\\").) Some languages, such as Finnish, have possessive affixes, which play the role of possessive determiners like my and his. Some theoreticians unify determiners and pronouns into a single class. For further information, see . Universal grammar is the theory that all humans are born equipped with grammar, and all languages share certain properties. There are arguments that determiners are not a part of universal grammar and are instead part of an emergent syntactic category. This has been shown through the studies of some languages' histories, including Dutch. Determiners may be subcategorized as predeterminers, central determiners and postdeterminers, based on the order in which they can occur. For example, \\"all my many very young children\\" uses one of each. \\"My all many very young children\\" is not grammatically correct because a central determiner cannot precede a predeterminer. ==Articles== Articles are words used with a noun (as a standalone word or a prefix or suffix) to specify the grammatical definiteness of a noun, and, in some languages, to volume or numerical scope. There are three articles 'a', 'an' and 'the'. ===Definite article=== The definite article in the English language is the word the. It denotes people, places, and things that have already been mentioned, implied, or presumed to be known by the listener. ===Indefinite article=== The indefinite article takes the forms of a and an in English. It is mostly synonymous with one, but the word one is usually used when emphasizing singularity. ==Demonstratives== Demonstratives are words, such as this and that, used to indicate which entities are being referred to and to distinguish those entities from others. They are usually deictic, which means their meaning changes with context. They can indicate how close the things being referenced are to the speaker, listener, or other group of people. In English Demonstratives express proximity of things with respect to the speaker. ===Proximal demonstratives=== In English, the words this and these are the proximal demonstratives. They express that the particular things being mentioned are very close to the speaker. ===Distal demonstratives=== The distal demonstratives in the English language are that and those. They express that there is some distance between the things being referenced and the speaker. ==Possessive determiner== Possessive determiners modify a noun by attributing possession (or other sense of belonging) to someone or something, and usually reflect the noun's genitive case. They are also known as possessive adjectives. ==Quantifiers== Quantifiers indicate quantity. Some examples of quantifiers include: all, some, many, few, and no. Quantifiers are also dependent of a noun. Quantifiers only indicate a vague quantity of objects, not a specific number, such as twelve, dozen, first, single, or once, which would be considered numerals. ==Distributive determiners== Distributive determiners, also called distributive adjectives, consider members of a group separately, rather than collectively. Words such as each, any, either, and neither are examples of distributive determiners. This type of determiner also depends on a noun. These determiners are not to be confused with distributive pronouns, which can operate without a noun. * Each went his own way. (Each is used as a pronoun, without an accompanying noun.) * Each man went his own way. (Each is used as a determiner, accompanying the noun man.) ==Interrogative determiners== Interrogatives are used to ask a question, such as which, what, and whose (personal possessive determiner). These determiners also depend on a noun. ==As a functional head== Some modern grammatical approaches regard determiners (rather than nouns) as the head of their phrase and thus refer to such phrases as determiner phrases rather than noun phrases. Under this assumption, every noun in a syntax tree is dominated by a determiner. There are many examples in natural language where nouns appear without a determiner, yet in determiner phrase grammars there must still be a determiner. To account for this, syntacticians consider the head of the determiner phrase to be an unpronounced null determiner. These grammar theories are either based on X-bar theory or descend from it, which requires that every noun has a corresponding determiner (or specifier). In the cases where a noun does not have an explicit determiner (as in physics uses mathematics), X-bar theory hypothesizes the presence of a zero article, or zero determiner, an X-bar specific form of the null determiner. Noun phrases that contain only a noun and do not have a determiner present are known as bare noun phrases. For more detail on theoretical approaches to the status of determiners, see . Under the universal grammar theory, most facets of language are inherent, and only idiosyncrasies of languages are learned. Determiners and their phrases would have to inherently be part of universal grammar in order for determiner phrase theory and universal grammar theory to be compatible. Some theoreticians unify determiners and pronouns into a single class. See Pronoun: Theoretical considerations. This is consistent with the determiner phrase viewpoint, whereby a determiner, rather than the noun that follows it, is taken to be the head of the phrase. == See also == * Classifier (linguistics) * Determiner spreading == References == == External links == * GrammarBank – Determiners Practice * SIL Glossary of linguistic terms – What is a determiner?

Those eligible for the subsidy were cut from 48 million to 46 million people. Another notable measure taken while he was Minister of Health was the issuance of compulsory licenses for several patented drugs. The drugs to be covered under the compulsory license included the HIV/AIDS drugs efavirenz and lopinavir/ritonavir, as well as the heart disease therapeutic clopidogrel. In addition, Mongkol proposed a broadcast ban on all alcohol advertising in Thailand. Although this proposed ban has yet to be signed by King Bhumibol Adulyadej, Thai broadcasters and publishers have voluntarily observed it.

In her youth, Vaite grew up immersed in traditional storytelling. Having won a scholarship to a leading girls' school in Papeete (Pape'ete), she became interested in works by French authors like Balzac, Flaubert, Zola and Maupassant. ==Career== Though a native French speaker, Vaite notably writes in English. She began to write out of homesickness while pregnant with her third child in Australia. Vaite has stated that writing in English gives her a wider audience as well as a greater creative freedom. Her first three novels—Breadfruit, Frangipani, and Tiare—follow Materena Mahi, a \\"professional cleaner\\" who lives in Faaa. The novels describe life in contemporary Tahiti from an inside perspective, through anecdotes and often with great humor. Vaite thus brings attention on a region of the world that Western literature has relegated to travel guides or often described in exotic terms. Her first two novels have been translated into French. L'arbre à pain, the French translation of Breadfruit, was warmly greeted in French Polynesia, where it was awarded the Prix littéraire des étudiants by the students of the University of French Polynesia in 2004. L'arbre à pain is also reputed to be the most widely read book in French Polynesia.

The Björketorp Runestone lacks names and is raised some tens of kilometers from the others. However, it is beyond doubt that the Björketorp runestone is connected to them, because in addition to the special runic forms, the same message is given on the Stentoften Runestone.

The novel describes a future America in which a virus similar to AIDS has panicked the U.S. government into setting up internment camps to contain the sufferers. The AIDS-like disease serves as backdrop and plot device to examine human relationships in circumstances of extreme duress. ==Plot summary== When a cure for AIDS turns out to be more virulent than the disease, the U.S. establishes quarantine camps in the desert southwest. Michael Barris, a TV producer, masquerades as one of the infected and travels to the camps in search of his son. He finds horrific conditions, and learns that the so-called quarantine camps are death camps where the infected are gathered, purposefully brutalized, and ultimately cremated alive, their ashes bulldozed into the desert sand. Barris's son escapes the camp before the cycle of immolation, carrying the evidence he needs to expose the governmental mis-information campaign. ==Adaptations== In 2006, DragonHearth produced the work as a podcast novel, and made it available as a free download from Podiobooks.com. ==Awards and nominations== * Winner 2007 Parsec Award for Speculative Fiction (Novel Form) ==ReferencesThe Immortals on Tracy Hickman's site * The Immortals on the Podiobooks site Category:1996 American novels Category:American science fiction novels Category:Dystopian novels Category:Novels about HIV/AIDS Category:Novels by Tracy Hickman ","title":"The Immortals (Hickman novel)"},{"id":"9075069","text":"Events from the year 1927 in the United Kingdom.

Backed by a protective and reassuring rock face, Chailland has been able to take advantage of its privileged position since prehistoric times. The Ernée, a river that generates energy, flows at its feet and the rich and verdant forest provides wood. The village took shape in the XIth century around the imposing Romanesque church, with domain, mill and manor. But the history of this city is especially deeply marked by the forges which, from 1550 & for the following three centuries, became the beating heart of the city employing up to five hundred workers. explaining the presence of the opulent buildings, which borrow some interesting architectural elements infrequent in boroughs of this size.

First run in 1927, the race regularly attracts accomplished runners from across the United States as well as internationally recognized competitors. ==History== The race was first held in 1927 with only twelve runners participating in the race. The race was conceived and promoted by the captain of the Manchester High School cross country team Frank \\"Duke\\" Haraburda, who competed and placed second in the inaugural race. The race continued annually until 1934, when the economic crisis during the Great Depression resulted in the race's cancellation.

The race committee estimates that approximately 1,000 unregistered runners participated in the 2005 race.2005 Manchester Road Race Summary In addition to the competitive spirit of the road race, Manchester Road Race enthusiasts are attracted every year to further enhance the good spirit of the event. Also giving this race a unique and high-spirited atmosphere, runners and fans wear costumes and may enter a competition to see who has the best costume each year. Famous among these costumed runners are the \\"Blues Brothers\\" and \\"Safety Man.\\" Of note, \\"Safety Man\\" also reminds runners and the crowd lining the streets that a safe morning means an enjoyable Thanksgiving afternoon. In a historic Manchester Road Race tradition preceding the race, \\"Safety Man\\" will lead the cavalcade of elite runners and alert spectators along the course that the race has begun and runners are approaching. ==Notable runnersJoe McCluskey=== Years won: 1930, 1931, 1932, 1947 Joe McCluskey was an American Olympic bronze medalist in the 1932 steeplechase who is recognized for winning the race four times. His brother John was the winner of the first race held in 1927. Joe's final Manchester Road Race victory came in 1947, 17 years after his first. ===John J. Kelley=== Years won: 1951, 1952, 1953, 1957, 1961, 1962 John J. Kelley (sometimes referred to as “The Younger”, to avoid confusion with the similarly named John A. Kelley) is an American runner from New London, CT who is best known for winning the Boston Marathon in 1957. He was an Olympic marathoner twice and won the Pan American Games marathon. He won the Manchester Road Race 6 times, and is also notable as a coach of Amby Burfoot. ===Ray Crothers=== Year won: 1965 Ray Crothers was an American runner known for being the only person to win three different divisions at Manchester. He twice won the High School Division and in 1984 he won the Masters Division. Ray had 14 top 25 finishes with a personal best of 23:07. He opened a running shoe and apparel store \\"The Run In\\" with John Vitale in Rocky Hill, CT. ===Amby Burfoot=== Years won: 1968, 1969, 1971, 1972, 1973, 1974, 1975, 1976, 1977 Amby Burfoot is an American runner from New London, Connecticut who is known for winning the 1968 Boston Marathon. As of 2015, he had competed in the Manchester Road Race 53 times in a row, winning 9 times (7 consecutively). His 53 consecutive races is the record for the Manchester Road Race, breaking the record of barefoot runner, Charlie \\"Doc\\" Robbins, who ran 51, though missing two while serving in WWII. Burfoot later became a journalist, eventually becoming the Executive Editor of Runner's World magazine. ===John Vitale=== Year won: 1970 John Vitale is an American runner known for being the top American finisher at the 1971 Boston Marathon. He later opened a running shoe and apparel store \\"The Run In\\" with Ray Crothers in Rocky Hill, CT. ===John Treacy=== Years won: 1978-79, 1984-85 In 1979, Irish brothers John and Ray Treacy ran Connecticut's historic, Thanksgiving Day, Manchester Road Race. John Treacy repeated his previous year's victory over nine-time race champion Amby Burfoot, breaking Burfoot's course record by 55 seconds with Ray finishing second, 59 seconds behind his brother. In 1981, Ray took second again, this time to legendary Irish runner, Eamonn Coghlan. John won the race again in 1984–85. His 1979 course record of 21:56 lasted until 1995.Coach Ray Treacy and John Treacy To Be Honored At The 81st Annual Manchester Road Race, Providence, November 22, 2017.

He set a then course record of 21:19 in 1995. ===Aaron Braun=== Years won: 2012 Aaron Braun, who ran at Adams State, tied the then old course record in 2012, with a time of 21:19.4. This was a bit controversial, since they should have rounded up to 21:20, but they gave him a tie anyway, because they didn't know how they had rounded, up or down, back in 1995 when Philemon Hanneck set the record, because they didn't have the technology to determine his time in tenths of a second. ===Edward Cheserek=== Year won: 2018 Edward Cheserek, a Kenyan-born athlete who ran for the University of Oregon, set the course record in 2018 with a time of 21:16. ==See also== *Turkey Trot *Road running ==References== ==External links== *Official Manchester Road Race website Category:Long- distance running competitions Category:Sports in Manchester, Connecticut Category:Tourist attractions in Hartford County, Connecticut Category:Road running competitions in the United States ","title":"Manchester Road Race"},{"id":"9075161","text":"For the German Bicycle and Motorcycle manufacturer see: Hercules Fahrrad GmbH & Co The Hercules Cycle and Motor Company Limited was a British bicycle manufacturer founded on 9 September 1910British Cycle Corporation, July 1958 in Aston in England.Company registration 111679: Companies House – http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk/ The name Hercules was chosen for its associations of durability and robustness. The company was founded by Edmund and Harry Crane and started life in Coventry Street, Birmingham, England, initially producing 25 bicycles a week.Birmingham Voice, 24 September 2003 ==History== Crane's parents bought the Petros Cycle Company which was subsequently managed by Edmund's mother, Edith. Their children, Harry and Ted, left school at 14 and helped their parents with the business. In 1906 Jack Crane was declared bankrupt and the family moved to Lightwoods Hill. There they sold bikes at auctions. The bankruptcy finding meant they were bought in the mother's name and sold to the sons even though she had also been made bankrupt. In 1911, Harry and Ted rented a derelict house in Coventry Street, using a name they had already registered in 1910, the Hercules Cycle and Motor Company. Harry assembled bicycles and Ted cycled around Birmingham for parts. Ted had problems selling because of fierce competition but soon made progress, trading on low price and high quality. Production outgrew the site and bikes were packed on the pavement. The brothers went from 25 to 70 bicycles a week within six months. They moved to a house with a yard in Conybere Street. It had 10 workers. Within a few months, production had doubled and the company moved to larger premises in Conybere Street, Highgate. ===Growth=== In 1923, a third move was made to an ex-Dunlop factory in Rocky Lane, Aston. This became Hercules's Britannia Works and grew to . It was the site of the company's offices.Birmingham Voice, 24 September 2003 By 1914 production rose to 10,000 a year. The First World War brought an order to make shells. In 1928 Hercules exported one in five of all British cycles and, by 1935, 40 per cent. In 1929, it took over the Dunlop factory in Nechells, less than a mile to the north- west in Long Acre. This site was named Manor Mills.Hercules Cycles The company made its six millionth bicycle in February 1939. During this period, Birmingham had been home to a large number of cycle manufacturers, most of which did not prosper. The success of Hercules was attributed to a number of factors, including the name and production methods. After 1923, Hercules produced the majority of the components of their bicycles, apart from the inner tubes and tyres. Factories ran using mass-production, producing more than 1,000 cycles a day, each taking less than 10 minutes to assemble. Ted Crane would not employ union members. He paid 10 per cent better than the union rate, although he sacked workers who could not produce 15 per cent more than unionised workers. Hercules exported a significant percentage of production – by the time Sir Malcolm Campbell was invited to see the three millionth bicycle in 1933, over half the production had been sent overseas, earning £6 million and letters of congratulation from the King and Prince of Wales. Production continued and by the end of the thirties, Hercules had produced more than six million bicycles, and could claim to be the biggest manufacturer of cycles in the world. A third factory was added in the 1950s in Plume Street, Long Acre, a short distance from Manor Mills. By this time, Hercules had become one of the largest businesses in Aston, and helped give the area its character.Birmingham City Council – History of Aston To this day, the mascot of Aston Villa football club is Hercules the Lion. In 1946, Crane sold the company to Tube Investments for three and a quarter million pounds criticising his accountant who he said had \\"given away the company\\".The Bicycle, 4 December 1946, p30 He stayed on the board of the company. TI had been the main supplier to Hercules, providing the tubing from which the bicycle frames were made. By then, Hercules had lost its understanding of the market. Its racing bike had steel handlebars when alloy was the fashion. It had five gears when 10 were normal. It had heavy tubing and not Reynolds 531. The last bicycles with the Hercules name were produced by Raleigh factory in Nottingham. The name was allowed to die, although Hercules registered accounts until the end of 2001 and the company was not wound up until 2 December 2003. By then it was registered at Raleigh's address in Triumph Road, Nottingham. Tube Investments combined the company with Norman, Phillips, and Sun to form the British Cycle Corporation in 1956. Hercules adopted the slogan 'Wonder Wheels'. ===Sponsorship=== In 1952 Eileen Sheridan became involved with Hercules. She broke records for Hercules between 1952 and 1954.\\"Eileen Sheridan – A Cycling Life\\" Peter Whitfield, Wychwood Publishing (2006) It was also at this time leading cyclist Derek Buttle approached Hercules about forming a racing team. In 1953, the company agreed, and became one of the first British bicycle manufacturers to run a professional road race team. The team raced on the Continent for a couple of years and disbanded in 1955.Dennis Talbot - ex-professional racing cyclist Sheridan, other time-trial professionals such as Ken Joy, and the road race team, were managed by a member of Hercules' sales staff, racing cyclist Frank Southall. He had held many records and rode for Britain in the Olympic Games. He also rode for Hercules as a professional. ===Consolidation and decline=== The British cycle industry suffered a downturn from this time, and Hercules was affected due to its reliance on exports – new tariffs were instituted in the US, and the Empire started to purchase bicycles produced in Africa and Asia. A 1955 attempt to diversify into moped production was largely unsuccessful. In 1956 Tube Investments made 1,250 employees of the British Cycle Corporation redundant, following deadlock with unions over changed working practices. Many of the workers were from Hercules factories.Our Century 1950-1975 As a result, Tube Investments bought the Nottingham-based Raleigh Cycle Company in 1960 to form TI Raleigh Industries. Combined, they controlled 75% of the British bicycle market. Management of the British Cycle Corporation was handed to the Raleigh management, as that company with its greater domestic focus, was larger and better known. Raleigh quickly decided to cut the number of brands, and move to using Raleigh designs and standards. Production was concentrated in Nottingham in 1960, and by 1963 there was little left of a distinctive Hercules. The original company – still part of Raleigh – was dissolved on 2 December 2003.

Haþuwulfar, Heruwulfar's son, :AQ Haþuwulf(a)r, Heruwulfar's son, in memory of Hariwulfar :B wrote these runes. ==Interpretation== The Istaby, Stentoften Runestone and Gummarp Runestone inscriptions can be identified with the same clan through the names that are mentioned on them.Looijenga (2003:188). The names have alliterative first name element combined with a lycophoric second element that represent an aristocratic naming tradition common among chieftains.Sundqvist & Hultgård (2004:584-85). The Björketorp Runestone lacks names and is raised some tens of kilometers from the others. However, it is beyond doubt that the Björketorp runestone is connected to them, because in addition to the special runic forms, the same message is given on the Stentoften Runestone. Of these, on stylistics grounds, the Istaby runestone may be the oldest. The name Hariwulfa is a combination of hari meaning \\"warrior\\" and wulafa \\"wolf,\\" while the haþu of Haþuwulfz means \\"battle\\" and the heru of Heruwulfar, when combined in personal names, means \\"sword.\\"Looijenga (2003:181). The latter name also has a suffix indicating paternal descent, so the name Heruwulfar in full means \\"of the family of Sword-Wolf.\\" A shortened form of the name Hariwulfa survived into the Viking Age and is attested in the inscription on the Hærulf Runestone. It has been suggested that the assignment of such lycophoric names is related to ritualistic practices and religious wolf-symbolism used in the initiation of young warriors.Gräslund (2006:125). The Istaby runestone is currently located at the Swedish Museum of National Antiquities in Stockholm. The stone has a Danish Rundata catalog number as Blekinge was part of the historic Denmark. ==References== ==Sources== * *Jacobsen, Lis & Moltke, Erik: Danmarks Runeindskrifter. 3rd tome. 1941. * * ==External links== *Photograph of stone in 1999 - Swedish National Heritage Board Category:6th-century inscriptions Category:7th-century inscriptions Category:8th-century inscriptions Category:Haþuwulf's runestones Category:Proto-Norse language Category:Runestones in Blekinge Category:Elder Futhark inscriptions ","title":"Istaby Runestone"},{"id":"9075181","text":"Stewart Park is located in Aberdeen, Scotland.

Shot in 16 mm, it was made for German television and originally aired in 1973, as a two-part miniseries. It was based on the 1964 novel Simulacron-3 by Daniel F. Galouye. An adaptation of the Fassbinder version was presented as the play World of Wires, directed by Jay Scheib, in 2012. Its focus is not on action, but on sophistic and philosophic aspects of the human mind, simulation, and the role of scientific research. A movie based on the same novel entitled The Thirteenth Floor starring Craig Bierko was released in 1999. == Plot == In the present day, Cybernetics and Future Science's (Institut für Kybernetik und Zukunftsforschung) new supercomputer hosts a simulation program that includes an artificial world with over 9,000 \\"identity units\\" who live as human beings, unaware that their world is just a simulation. Professor Vollmer (Adrian Hoven), who is technical director of the program, is apparently on the verge of an incredible secret discovery. He becomes increasingly agitated and anti- social before dying in a mysterious accident. His successor, Dr. Fred Stiller, has a discussion with Günther Lause, the security adviser of the institute, when the latter suddenly disappears without trace, before passing on Vollmer's secret to Stiller. More mysterious still is the fact that none of the other IKZ employees seem to have any memory of Lause. Meanwhile, one of the identity units in the simulation attempts suicide. This unit is deleted by Stiller's colleague Walfang, to keep the simulation stable. To investigate the reasons for the suicide, Stiller contacts the contact unit of the simulated world. The unit, called Einstein, is the only identity unit who knows about the simulation, and this is necessary to run the program. In an attempt to become a real person, Einstein switches his mind into Walfang's body while Stiller is in contact with the simulated world. Einstein gives Stiller an explanation for the mysteries, vanishing memories, and vanishing persons. He tells him that the real world is nothing else but a simulation of a real world that is one level above. This knowledge causes Stiller to slip into insanity. The other \\"real\\" people interrogate Stiller, and he is threatened with death, incarceration, and involuntary commitment. Stiller is finally able to convince Hahn, the IKZ psychologist, of his theory. The latter soon dies in an accident that is pinned on Stiller, marking him as the suspected murderer of both Hahn and Vollmer. Stiller flees and searches for the necessary contact unit who can connect the \\"real\\" world with the real world a level above. He survives several assassination attempts and discovers the contact is Eva, projected into the simulation as Vollmer's daughter after his death, with whom he believed he had once had a romance. Eva tells him he was modeled on the real Fred Stiller, a person whom Eva loved, but became mad with power from directing the simulation in the world above. While Stiller is programmed to die in an ambush, Eva switches the minds of the two Stillers and brings the simulated Stiller into the real world. == Music == The martial folk song \\"Westerwaldlied\\" and standard German love song \\"Lili Marleen\\" are both featured in an extended scene in which Stiller seeks temporary respite in a cabaret. The instrumental \\"Albatross\\" by Fleetwood Mac plays during the credits of both parts, as well as a scene in Part 2. == Cast == * Klaus Löwitsch as Fred Stiller * Mascha Rabben as Eva Vollmer * Karl-Heinz Vosgerau as Herbert Siskins * Adrian Hoven as Professor Henry Vollmer * Ivan Desny as Günther Lause * Barbara Valentin as Gloria Fromm * Günter Lamprecht as Fritz Walfang * Margit Carstensen as Maya Schmidt-Gentner * Wolfgang Schenck as Franz Hahn * Joachim Hansen as Hans Edelkern * Gottfried John as Einstein * Rudolf Lenz as Hartmann * Kurt Raab as Mark Holm * Karl Scheydt as Detective Stuhlfauth * Ernst Küsters Bodyguard * El Hedi ben Salem Bodyguard * Rainer Hauer as Inspector Lehner * Ulli Lommel as Rupp * Heinz Meier as Von Weinlaub * Ingrid Caven as Uschi * Eddie Constantine as Man in car * Rainer Langhans as Waiter at party == Release == A completely restored version was shown at the 60th Berlin International Film Festival in 2010.

Enrico Caviglia (4 May 1862 – 22 March 1945) was a distinguished officer in the Italian Army. Victorious on the bloody battlefields of the Great War, he rose in time to the highest rank in his country, Marshal of Italy; he was also a Senator of the kingdom. Via Enrico Caviglia in Finale Ligure. ==Early years== Caviglia was born in Finalmarina (the marine borough of Finale Ligure), the sixth son of Pietro Caviglia and Antonietta Saccone. After early studies in his hometown, in 1877 he gained admission to the military college \\"Teulié\\" in Milan. In 1880 he became a cadet in the Military Academy of Turin; three years later he received his first promotion to second lieutenant in the artillery corps. Caviglia took part in the African campaign of 1888/89 in Eritrea as a first lieutenant in the II Artillery regiment; in 1891 he was admitted to the War School. The year 1893 saw him promoted to captain. In 1896 and 1897 he took part anew in the African campaign and was present when the Italian army suffered a dreadful defeat in the Battle of Adowa in Ethiopia. By this time, he was known especially for the quality of his work in geography. After several other assignments, in 1904 he was appointed as extraordinary military attaché in Tokyo, Japan, where he was tasked with observing Japanese military operations in the Russo-Japanese War. From 1905 to 1911, he became the titular military attaché first in the Japanese capital, then in Beijing, China. On 22 September 1908 he was awarded the rank of lieutenant colonel and honorary field assistant to the king. In 1912 Caviglia was sent to Tripolitania and Cyrenaica; his task was to oversee both the negotiations for the pullout of Turkish troops resulting from the Italo-Turkish War and the pacification of Arab and Berber chieftains. On 6 February 1913 he was appointed vice director of the Military Geographic Institute (IGM) in Florence, to reach the rank of colonel the next year. ==World War I== When in 1915 Italy entered the First World War against Austria-Hungary, Caviglia was made major general. Next year his troops distinguished themselves in the bloody battles of the Carso, where Caviglia led Brigade Bari in extremely harsh fights at Bosco Lancia and Bosco Cappuccio. Hence his being decorated with the Cross of Cavalier of the Military Order of Savoy \\"for the skill and valor he exhibited\\". On 14 June 1917 Caviglia was promoted to lieutenant general for his merits on the battlefield: in August, as commanding officer of XXIV Army Corps, he overran the Austro-Hungarians on the Bainsizza plateau, the most brilliant Italian advance in the Eleventh Battle of the Isonzo. After the disastrous Twelfth Battle of the Isonzo, in which he had no responsibility for the defeat, Caviglia received the Silver Medal for his skill in keeping his men united and disciplined throughout the retreat to the Piave line, contrary to what happened in large sectors of the Italian army. He was also transferred to serve as commander of X Army Corps. September 1918 saw Caviglia being made a titular commander of army corps by war merits, and by November he had been put in charge of the new Eighth Army, which decisively crushed the crumbling Austro-Hungarian forces at the Battle of Vittorio Veneto. ==Between the wars== After the war, King George V of Great Britain invested him as a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath; Enrico Caviglia was now a Sir. On 22 February 1919 he was appointed Senator for life, and later took part in Vittorio Emanuele Orlando's first government as Minister of War. When Gabriele D'Annunzio occupied Fiume with his \\"legionnaires\\", Caviglia was called to replace general Pietro Badoglio, dating from 21 December 1920, as troop commander and extraordinary commissioner in the Venezia Giulia. From 24 to 31 December 1920 he led the repression of D'Annunzio's movement, the so-called Natale di sangue (Bloody Christmas) in execution of the Treaty of Rapallo. This act was to charge Caviglia with grievous doubts to the end of his life, doubts he expressed in his personal diary. Monument to Generale Enrico Caviglia in Finale Ligure. On 25 June 1926, Enrico Caviglia was appointed Marshal of Italy (Maresciallo d'Italia). This was the highest military rank in the Kingdom of Italy. Four years later, he was made a Cavalier in the Supreme Order of the Most Holy Annunciation (Ordine Supremo della Santissima Annunziata). Caviglia thus became a 'cousin' of King Victor Emmanuel III. Opposed to Benito Mussolini's policies and regime, he was overshadowed by other officers, less able on the battlefields but more prone to power and ideology. ==World War II== In 1943, from 8 to 13 September, as the king's court fled the incoming Germans after surrendering the country to the Allies, the aged Caviglia had to take the military command in Rome and to negotiate with Field Marshal Albert Kesselring the surrender of the capital in exchange for the respect of its theoretical status as open city. By this time he had developed an intense dislike of Badoglio (who was defined by him once as \\"a barn dog that goes where there is the biggest morsel\\"), who had left him in dire straits thrice: in Caporetto (1917), in Fiume (1920) and then finally in Rome, benefiting in the meantime of the favors of the Fascist regime. Caviglia eventually retired to his villa, named Villa Vittorio Veneto, in Finale Ligure, to die just a month before the end of World War II. His body was interred in the Basilica of St. John the Baptist in Finale Ligure Marina, but on 22 June 1952, under the eyes of Luigi Einaudi, President of the Italian Republic, and former prime minister Vittorio Emanuele Orlando, his remains were finally reinterred in the tower of Capo San Donato, just east of Finale. Caviglia left a Diary which documents the evolution of his thought on many subjects, his skepticism about the Fascist regime, as well as his confusion about what was going on in World War II, a world he could not recognize any more; plus he left military memoirs and geographical treatises and works. ==Honors== *Supreme Knight of the Order of the Most Holy Annunciation *Knight Grand Cross of the Military Order of Savoy *Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath ==References== * ==External links== *A short biography * Category:1862 births Category:1945 deaths Category:People from the Province of Savona Category:Italian military personnel of the Italo-Turkish War Category:Field marshals of Italy Category:Honorary Knights Commander of the Order of the Bath Category:Members of the Senate of the Kingdom of Italy Category:Italian military personnel of the First Italo-Ethiopian War Category:People of the Russo-Japanese War Category:Italian military personnel of World War I Category:Italian military attachés ","title":"Enrico Caviglia"},{"id":"9075322","text":"A.

As of 31 December 2008, it has a population of 5,325. ==Geographic location== Głogów Małopolski lies in southern part of the Sandomierz Basin, and historically belongs to the province of Lesser Poland. Since its foundation until the Partitions of Poland, the town was part of Sandomierz Voivodeship. In 1772 - 1918, it belonged to the Austrian province of Galicia. The distance to Rzeszów is . The town is served by Rzeszow’s municipal transport system, it also has a rail station, with connections to Rzeszow, Stalowa Wola and Lublin. Furthermore, Głogów lies along National Road Nr. 9, which is part of the European route E371. Road traffic now bypasses the center of the town, due to a ring road, opened in 2005. ==History== The history of Głogów begins on April 22, 1570, when a local nobleman Krzysztof Glowa of Nowosielce (Jelita coat of arms) issued a document, upon which a brand new town called Głowów was to be founded in a forest along a merchant route to Sandomierz. According to Glowa’s plans, the town was to become an ideal Renaissance urban center, competing with the nearby Rzeszow. Architects, employed by Glowa, designed a large market square (168/168 meters), with plots for 40 houses. Furthermore, special plots were fashioned for gardens, church, rectory, bath house, hospital, mill, brewery and folwark. According to the original plans, Głowów was to have 200 houses, whose residents were to be exempted from taxes for 20 years. Two fairs a year were planned, markets took place every Tuesday, and the inhabitants were permitted to brew their own beer. The shape of the municipal government and court was based on Magdeburg rights town law. After the death of Krzysztof Glowa, the town belonged to Castellan of Sandomierz Mikolaj Spytko Ligeza of Bobrek (Polkozic coat of arms). The new owner confirmed all privileges, granting new ones. Ligeza founded a wooden parish church with a bell tower (1630), a hospital for the poor, and a wooden town hall (1636). After a Crimean Tatars raid (1624), the town was surrounded by a protective rampart with several towers, whose traces are still visible in some spots. Mikolaj Ligeza died in 1637, and after his death, Głowów, together with Rzeszów and Sedziszow Malopolski was captured by the Zaslawski family. Soon afterwards, it passed into the hands of the Lubomirski family, which owned it for 150 years, and changed the name to Głogów. The town was burned down by the soldiers of George II Rakoczi, during the Swedish invasion of Poland. Once again, it was looted and destroyed during the Great Northern War. In 1725 Urszula Lubomirska built a small palace, together with an extensive garden. In 1766, a new church together with a monastery was completed, together with a town hall (the monastery burned in 1803). Głogów prospered in the second half of the 18th century. Until 1772 (see Partitions of Poland) it belonged to Lesser Poland’s Sandomierz Voivodeship, and in 1772 - 1918, it was part of Austrian province of Galicia. The town was famous in the region for its fairs In the 19th century, Głogów remained a local center of commerce and administration, with a court, a post office, notary public, pharmacy and a school. The residents of the town actively supported patriotic movements, with some of them joining the November Uprising and the January Uprising, which took place in the Russian-controlled Congress Poland. Most of the buildings were made of wood, which resulted in frequent fires. To prevent them, the Firefigter Volunteers was created in 1878. In 1903, local office of the Gymnastic Association Sokol was opened here, and its members later joined the Polish Legions of Józef Piłsudski. In the Second Polish Republic, Głogów belonged to Lwow Voivodeship, and in the late 1930s, with the Central Industrial Area, the town’s importance was reduced at the expense of the quickly growing Rzeszow. As a result, Głogów turned into Rzeszow’s commuter town. During World War II, local Jewish population was exterminated by the Germans in the Holocaust. Some 5,000 people, both Poles and Polish Jews, were murdered in a forest, located between Głogów and Rzeszow. In the night of February 22/23, the town was captured by a local Armia Ludowa unit, and in a skirmish, the town hall was burned. As a reprisal, the Gestapo later shot 6 hostages. The town was captured by the Red Army on July 30, 1944. Soon after the war, when the ancient Silesian city of Głogów was annexed by the People's Republic of Poland, the adjective “Małopolski” (Lesser Polish) was added to the town’s name, to distinguish it from the Silesian city. In 1950, electrification of the town was completed, and in 1960, Głogów Małopolski received rail connection with Rzeszow. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Cities and towns in Podkarpackie Voivodeship Category:Rzeszów County Category:Lesser Poland Category:Populated places in the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria Category:Lwów Voivodeship Category:Holocaust locations in Poland Category:Nazi war crimes in Poland ","title":"Głogów Małopolski"},{"id":"9075393","text":"Dry Creek is a stream in Stanislaus County, California, that is a tributary to the Tuolumne River.United States Geological Survey (USGS) 7½ Minute Riverbank Quadrangle. ==Course== Dry Creek originates just north of the Modesto Reservoir.

It is no longer used today. Rudolph Emmerich and Oscar Löw, two German physicians who were the first to make an effective medication from microbes, conducted experiments in the 1890s, roughly 30 years after Louis Pasteur showed that many diseases were caused by bacteria and nearly 40 years before the effective prescription of penicillin. They proved that the germs that caused one disease may be the cure for another. Emmerich and Löw isolated germs from infected bandages that caused green infections in open wounds. The germ was a bacterium then called Bacillus pycyaneus (now called Pseudomonas aeruginosa, it produces pyocyanin, a characteristic green-blue phenazine pigment). They then mixed the isolate with other bacteria and showed that B. pycyaneus and extracts from its cultures were able to destroy other strains of bacteria. Among the bacteria that it killed were those that caused cholera, typhoid, diphtheria, and anthrax. From these experiments Emmerich and Löw created a medication based on extracts of B. pycyaneus that they called pyocyanase. It was the first antibiotic to be used in hospitals. Unfortunately, its effectiveness was sporadic, did not work equally on all patients, and the presence of large amounts of phenazines such as pyocyanin made it quite toxic to humans. As a result, the drug was eventually abandoned. ==See also== Prontosil ==References== Category:Antibiotics Category:History of pharmacy ","title":"Pyocyanase"},{"id":"9075610","text":"In probability theory, Bernstein inequalities give bounds on the probability that the sum of random variables deviates from its mean.

Thus, special cases of the Bernstein inequalities are also known as the Chernoff bound, Hoeffding's inequality and Azuma's inequality. ==Some of the inequalities== 1\\\\. Let X_1, \\\\ldots, X_n be independent zero-mean random variables. Suppose that X_i\\\\leq M almost surely, for all i. Then, for all positive t, :\\\\mathbb{P} \\\\left (\\\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i \\\\geq t \\\\right ) \\\\leq \\\\exp \\\\left ( -\\\\frac{\\\\tfrac{1}{2} t^2}{\\\\sum_{i = 1}^n \\\\mathbb{E} \\\\left[X_i^2 \\\\right ]+\\\\tfrac{1}{3} Mt} \\\\right ). 2\\\\. Let X_1, \\\\ldots, X_n be independent zero-mean random variables. Suppose that for some positive real L and every integer k>1, : \\\\mathbb{E} \\\\left[ \\\\left X_i^k \\\\right \\\\right ] \\\\leq \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\mathbb{E} \\\\left[X_i^2\\\\right] L^{k-2} k!

Bernstein also proved generalizations of the inequalities above to weakly dependent random variables. For example, inequality (2) can be extended as follows. X_1, \\\\ldots, X_n be possibly non- independent random variables. Suppose that for all integer i>0, :\\\\begin{align} \\\\mathbb{E} \\\\left. \\\\left [ X_i \\\\right  X_1, \\\\ldots, X_{i-1} \\\\right ] &= 0, \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbb{E} \\\\left. \\\\left [ X_i^2 \\\\right  X_1, \\\\ldots, X_{i-1} \\\\right ] &\\\\leq R_i \\\\mathbb{E} \\\\left [ X_i^2 \\\\right ], \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbb{E} \\\\left. \\\\left [ X_i^k \\\\right  X_1, \\\\ldots, X_{i-1} \\\\right ] &\\\\leq \\\\tfrac{1}{2} \\\\mathbb{E} \\\\left. \\\\left[ X_i^2 \\\\right  X_1, \\\\ldots, X_{i-1} \\\\right ] L^{k-2} k! \\\\end{align} Then :\\\\mathbb{P} \\\\left( \\\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i \\\\geq 2t \\\\sqrt{\\\\sum_{i=1}^n R_i \\\\mathbb{E}\\\\left [ X_i^2 \\\\right ]} \\\\right) < \\\\exp(-t^2), \\\\qquad \\\\text{for}\\\\quad 0 < t \\\\leq \\\\frac{1}{2L} \\\\sqrt{\\\\sum_{i=1}^n R_i \\\\mathbb{E} \\\\left [X_i^2 \\\\right ]}.

It is one of the oldest works of midrash, along with Bereshit Rabbah and the Pesiḳta ascribed to Rab Kahana. ==Names== The midrash is quoted, perhaps for the first time, by R. Hananeel under the name \\"Aggadat Eichah.\\" Many passages are quoted by R. Nathan, who invariably calls the work \\"Megillat Eichah.\\" The term \\"Eichah Rabbati,\\" which is general even now, is used to designate the many extracts in Yalkut Shimoni which have been included with the other Biblical books. In Eichah Rabbah itself the sources are almost always missing. The names \\"Midrash Eichah,\\" \\"Midrash Kinot,\\" \\"Megillat Kinot,\\" are also found in the old authors. In Yalkut Shimoni there are likewise long extracts from a Midrash on Lamentations published under the name \\"Midrash Zutta\\".By Solomon Buber (Berlin, 1894) ==Contents== The work begins with 36 consecutive proems forming a separate collection, certainly made by the author of the Midrash. They constitute more than one-fourth of the work47b-52b in the Venice edition, 1545 These proems and, perhaps, most of the annotations, which are arranged in the sequence of the verses,52c-66b originated in the discourses of which, in olden times, the Book of Lamentations had been the subject. The aggadic explanation of this book—which is a dirge on the destruction of the first and second Temples in Jerusalem and the national destruction that came along with it—was treated by scholars as especially appropriate to the Ninth of Av, to the day of the destruction of the Temple, and to the evening before Tisha BeAv.Compare Talmud Yerushalmi Shabbat 15c; Lamentations Rabbah 4:20; Yerushalmi Ta'an. 68d et seq. === The Proems === The sources from which Yerushalmi drew must have been accessible to the author of Eichah Rabbah, which was certainly edited some time after the completion of the former, and which probably borrowed from it. In the same way older collections must have served as the common source for Eichah Rabbah, Bereshit Rabbah, and especially for the Pesiḳta de-Rab Kahana. The aggadic comment on Hosea 6:7 appears earlier as a proem to a discourse on Lamentations, and is included among the proems in this Midrashed. S. Buber, p. 3a as a comment on Genesis 3:9.Genesis Rabbah 29 The close of this proem, which serves as a connecting link with Lamentations 1:1, is found also in the Pesiḳta as the first proem to pericope 15 (p. 119a) to Isaiah 1:21, the Hafṭarah for the Sabbath before the Ninth of Ab.Compare Müller, Einleitung in die Responsen, p. 38 The same is the case with the second and fourth proems in the Pesiḳta, which are identical with the fourth and third (according to the correct enumeration) of the proems to Eichah Rabbah; the fifth in the Pesiḳta (120b-121b), which corresponds to the second in this Midrash, has a defective ending. With a change in the final sentences, the first proem in Eichah Rabbah is used as a proem in the Pesiḳta pericope 11 (110a), and with a change of the proem text and of its close, proem 10 (9) of Eichah Rabbah is found as a proem in the Pesiḳta pericope 19 (137b). On the other hand, there is found embodied in the exposition of Lamentations 1:2, \\"she weepeth sore in the night,\\" etc., a whole proem, the text of which is Psalms 78:7 et seq., \\"I remember my lute-playing in the night,\\" etc.; this proem contains also the final sentence which serves as introduction to the section Isaiah 49:14,ed. Buber, p. 30a and it is known from the Pesiḳta pericope 17129b et seq. to be a proem to a discourse on this section, which is intended for the second \\"consolatory Sabbath\\" after the Ninth of Av. From this, it becomes evident that the collector of the Eichah Rabbah used the aggadic exposition—found in the Pesiḳta fulfilling its original purpose—as a comment on Lamentations 1:2. The same is true of the commentary to Lamentations 1:21ed. Buber, p. 47a for which there was used a proem on the Pesiḳta section Isaiah 51:12, intended originally for the fourth Sabbath after the Ninth of Av, and a section which had for its text this verse of Lamentations (pericope 19, p. 138a); and also in regard to the comment to Lamentations 3:39,ed. Buber, p. 68a which consists of a proem of the Pesiḳta pericope 18 (p. 130b). But the author also added four proems from Eichah Rabbah itself (29, 18, 19, 31, according to the correct enumeration), retaining the introductory formula ר ... פתח, as a commentary to Lamentations 3:1,14,15; 4:12.ed. Buber, pp. 61b, 64a, b, 74b The opinion set forth in the introduction to Buber's critical edition that the arrangement of the proems at the beginning of the work was made by a later editor, who included the marked comments of the Midrash as proems, and who, after prefixing the introductory formula to a comment on the Midrash Ḳohelet 12:1 et seq., used it as a proem for Eichah Rabbah 24 (23), is entirely wrong. There can be no doubt that precisely the opposite process has taken place. The entire interpretation in Ecclesiastes Rabbah 12:1-7, which consists of two versions, is composed of two proems—that in Vayikra RabbahVayikra Rabbah, ch. 18, beginning and the proem in this Midrash. The numberless proems originating in the synagogal discourses of the earliest times must be regarded as the richest source upon which the collectors of the midrashim could draw.Compare Monatsschrift, 1880, p. 185; Maybaum, Die Aeltesten Phasen in der Entwickelung der Jüdischen Predigt, p. 42 === Running commentary and stories === In the part of Eichah Rabbah which contains the running commentary to the Book of Lamentations, the character of interpretation is on the whole the same as in Bereshit Rabbah. Side by side with the simple interpretation of sentences and words, and with various midrashic explanations dating from different authors (whose comments are placed in juxtaposition), the Midrash contains aggadic passages having some sort of relation to the verse. For example, in connection with the words \\"at the beginning of the watches\\" (Lamentations 2:19) is introduced the whole discussion of YerushalmiTalmud Yerushalmi, Berachot 2d on the statement of the Mishnah, \\"to the end of the first watch\\"; in connection with the words \\"let us lift up our heart with our hands to God in heaven\\" (3:41) is introduced a story from Yerushalmi Taanit 65a, telling how R. Abba bar Zabda preached on this verse during a fast-day service. It is not strange that for similar expressions, such as \\"en lo . . .\\" and \\"lo matz'ah manoah\\" occurring in Lam. 1:2, 3, and Genesis 8:9, 11:30, Eichah Rabbahed. Buber, pp. 31a et seq. uses the explanations of Bereishit Rabbah 38 and 33,end; or that in the Eichah Rabbah the same aggadah is found three timespp. 23a, 56a, 56b (to explain the three passages Lamentations 1:1, 2:4, and 2:5, in each of which the word \\"like\\" occurs; or that the same comment is applied to 3:53 and 3:56; or that a sentence of R. Simeon b. Laḳish is used five times;On 3:3, 3:18, 3:22, 3:26, 3:32 or that the explanation for reversing the order and putting the letter פ before ע is given twice.On 2:16, 3:46 Eichah Rabbah comments on every verse in Lamentations, except a few verses in chapter 3. To some verses (2:20, 3:51, 4:13,18,19) are added the stories to which they were referred, even though they are also found in the large collections on 2:2 and 1:16: \\"For these things I weep; mine eye, mine eye runneth down with water.\\" These collections, as well as the long passage on 1:5 (\\"her enemies prosper\\"), giving so many accounts of the sufferings of Israel, including the times of the First and Second Temples and the fateful Bar Kochba revolt, are the most impressive in Eichah Rabbah; they form an integral part of the work, like the interesting sagas and stories to Lamentations 1:1 on the greatness of the city of Jerusalem and the intelligence of her inhabitants. Jerusalem and Athens are contrasted in ten stories. The Scriptural words \\"the populous city, the city great among the nations,\\" are vividly interpreted in the Midrash as meaning \\"great in intelligence.\\" In connection with \\"the sons of Zion, the splendid ones\\" (4:2), the Midrash tells of social and domestic customs. The stories of Eichah Rabbah fill over fifteen columns of the Venice edition (about eleven in the first chapter), and include more than one-fourth of the midrashic comments (without the proems). Without these stories the differences in size of the several chapters would have been less apparent, even if (as was perhaps the case) the first chapter, in the form in which the author knew it, offered more opportunity for comments than did the other chapters. From this, Zunz erroneously concludedIn the Gottesdienstliche Vorträge that \\"the last sections were added later\\"; and, furthermore, \\"that the completion of the whole work must not be placed before the second half of the seventh century,\\" because Zunz concludes that the empire of the Arabians is referred to even in a passage of the first chapter. However, according to a reading of S. Buber's editionp. 39a (which is the only correct one as shown by the context), Seir, not Ishmael, is mentioned in connection with Edom in this passage to 1:14. Zunz' other arguments likewise fail to prove such a late date for the Midrash, especially since Zunz himself concludes that the authorities mentioned therein by name are not later than Yerushalmi. All that can be definitely stated is that Eichah Rabbah was edited after the completion of the Yerushalmi, and that Bereshit Rabbah must also be considered as of earlier date, not so much because it was drawn upon, as because of the character of the proem collection in Eichah Rabbah. Like Bereshit Rabbah, Eichah Rabbah is of Judean origin, and rich in foreign words, especially Greek. It certainly is not strange that the \\"Vive domine imperator!\\" with which R. Johanan b. Zakkai is said to have approached Vespasian in his camp, should have been reproduced. The same phrase was likewise transmitted in Aramaic and Hebrew form, in Buber's edition and in the Arukh. ==References== * === Jewish Encyclopedia bibliography === *Earliest editions of the Midrash Eichah in the Midrashim on the Five Megillot, Pesaro, 1519; Constantinople, 1520; in the complete editions of the Rabbot to Pent. and Megillot, Venice, 1545; Cracow, 1587; Salonica, 1594; *Eichah Rabbati, ed.

A complaint was made shortly after the foundation that Richard had diverted a watercourse to the abbey that had been used by a nearby village and that he also had given of common land to the monastery. It is unknown whether this issue was resolved. In 1311 a nun, Margery of Hedsor, left the monastery and her vows and was subsequently excommunicated. This sentence was renewed periodically for some years until it was cancelled by the Bishop for reasons unknown. A serious legal dispute occurred in 1330, concerning the ownership of the manor of Bulstrode, which had been granted to the abbey but was claimed by a Geoffrey de Bulstrode, who in protest proceeded to vandalise the property and harass the servants of the abbess. Eventually a commission found in favour of the abbey, but by then there had been substantial losses. ==Seizure== Having few assets, Burnham Abbey should have been closed in the first wave of the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1536, but a petition by local commissioners delayed its end until 1539. The document of surrender, dated 19 September 1539, was signed by Alice Baldwin, as Abbess, and the nine remaining nuns. There were also two priests.David Knowles and R.

In 1569, Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk, was detained there before being sent to the Tower of London. The church was demolished in about 1570 and a house was formed from much of the remaining buildings. By 1719, it was a farm with some of the buildings such as the refectory in poor condition. In 1913 James Lawrence Bissley, an architect and surveyor, purchased the property and restored the remaining buildings, converting the original chapter house into a chapel. In 1916 he sold the property to the Society of the Precious Blood, a community of Anglican Augustinian nuns, who took possession and began to restore and extend the abbey for their use.SPB website The Abbey is a Grade I listed building, while the associated walls and structures are Grade II.

Paul Gustav Samuel Stäckel (20 August 1862, Berlin – 12 December 1919, Heidelberg) was a German mathematician, active in the areas of differential geometry, number theory, and non-Euclidean geometry. In the area of prime number theory, he used the term twin prime (in its German form, \\"Primzahlzwilling\\") for the first time. According to Tietze, in reference to the term Primzahlzwillinge (i.e. \\"prime number twins\\"), \\"Der Ausdruck ist wohl von P. Stäckel (1862-1920) geprägt und hat sich seitdem eingebürgert.\\".

Stäckel worked on both mathematics and the history of mathematics. He edited the letters exchanged between Carl Friedrich Gauss and Wolfgang Bolyai, made contributions to editions of the collected works of Euler and Gauss (for whose works he wrote Gauss als Geometer), and edited the Geometrischen Untersuchungen by Wolfgang and Johann Bolyai (published in 1913). Additionally he translated works of Jacob Bernoulli, Johann Bernoulli, Augustin Louis Cauchy, Leonhard Euler, Joseph-Louis Lagrange, Adrien-Marie Legendre, Carl Gustav Jacobi from French and Latin into German for the series Ostwalds Klassiker der exakten Wissenschaften. In 1904 he was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Heidelberg. In 1905 he was the president of the Deutsche Mathematiker-Vereinigung.

O'Neill had a UK top five hit single with \\"I Was Kaiser Bill's Batman\\" credited as 'Whistling Jack Smith' (a play on \\"Whispering\\" Jack Smith). He recorded this as the solo whistler for a set fee and was never acknowledged as the performer of this unusual hit, nor paid any royalties. When the track was aired on Top of the Pops, O'Neill and his family were shocked to see an actor appear on stage to mime to the recorded backing track. Some sources attribute the single to British Decca/Deram producer Noel Walker, as producer and performing artist although the b-side of the single The British Grin and Bear is co-attributed to Walker. O'Neill was a member of The Michael Sammes Singers (also known as Mike Sammes and the Locals, Mike Sammes Singers and The Mike Sammes Singers) in the United Kingdom. Mike Sammes's group were a vocal group, known primarily for their work as session singers providing backing vocals, although the group also recorded seven albums of their own. Johnny O'Neill and the Michael Sammes Singers provided backing vocals on the recording of \\"I Am The Walrus\\" by the Beatles in 1967, which required them to do \\"all sorts of swoops and phonetic noises\\" according to Paul McCartney: the score George Martin prepared for them included the chanting of phrases like \\"ho ho ho, he he he, ha ha ha\\", \\"oompah, oompah, stick it up your jumper\\" and \\"everybody's got one\\". They also sang on the Beatles' \\"Good Night\\", as well as on their last album, Let It Be, at the behest of Phil Spector. Sammes also provided the distinctive basso backing vocals on Olivia Newton-John's early country crossover hits, including \\"Banks of the Ohio\\", \\"Let Me Be There\\" and \\"If You Love Me (Let Me Know)\\". Despite this productivity, his group, the Mike Sammes Singers, have only one entry in The Guinness Book of British Hit Singles, for \\"Somewhere My Love\\" in July 1967. Ennio Morricone's soundtrack for the film The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, contained whistling by John O'Neill. The main theme, also titled \\"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\\", was a hit in 1968 with the soundtrack album on the charts for more than a year. reaching No. 4 on the Billboard pop album chart and No. 10 on the black album chart. O'Neill also sang the theme tune to the American TV series Wagon Train, where he was credited as Johnny O'Neill, and the recordings of traditional Irish songs The Gordon Franks Singers And Music With John O'Neill was recorded with The Gordon Franks Singers and Music, in which he was the solo tenor. On these recordings, O'Neill sings in an Irish accent, though his actual voice was rather more Geordie/London. Living with his wife for the majority of their life in Ilford in Essex, they raised four daughters and later retired to Dovercourt, Essex. ==See also== *Batman (military) ==References== ==External links== * 'When a Whistling Song Became a 1967 Radio Hit'.

In the end, they reached an agreement to divide the disputed area between them. ==BackgroundCivilian takeover=== The Colombia–Peru War was the result of dissatisfaction with the Salomón-Lozano Treaty and the imposition of heavy tariffs on sugar. The war started with an internal insurrection in Peru and a civilian takeover of the city of Iquitos. On 1 September 1932, President Luis Miguel Sánchez dispatched two regiments of the Peruvian Army to Leticia and Tarapacá; both settlements were in the Amazonas Department, now in southern Colombia. Those actions were then mostly ignored by the Colombian government. ===Colombian patriotism=== It was not until 17 September that the Colombian government took notice. The Peruvian forces, which were encamped on the banks of the Putumayo River, stopped several large trade ships from traveling to Leticia. The result was an explosion of Colombian patriotism. Laureano Gómez, the head of the Senate minority, proclaimed, \\"Peace, peace, peace in inner Colombia; war, war, war on the border against our despicable enemy.\\" On 19 September, El Tiempo reported that it had received over 10,000 letters calling for war and control of Leticia. The same day, thousands of Colombian students marched through the streets of Bogotá chanting, \\"Sánchez Cerro will die and Colombia will defy!\\" Vásquez Cobo was declared the general of the Colombian Amazonian Navy, and 10 million dollars were approved by the Senate to fund his venture. Over 400 kg of gold were donated by the Colombian cities as a symbol of gratitude to the Huilan engineer César García Álvarez. War Memorial in Tarapacá, Colombia. The plaque reads, \\"To the Heroes of the Colombian Air Force; who with true courage gave the best of themselves; flying with their noble aircraft over river and jungle. Declaring over our Amazonia with the sound of their motors the sovereignty of our country during the war with Peru.\\" ==Hostilities== Sánchez believed that Colombia had no chance of defending itself since it lacked roads and a proper navy, and the Amazon region had no Colombian military presence. It was not until December 1932 that General Alfredo Vásquez Cobo reached the mouth of the Amazon River with a fleet of old ships that he acquired in Europe. Within 90 days, Colombia organised a respectable military response to the Peruvian invasion. Herbert Boy and other German aviators of SCADTA, which later became Avianca, fitted their commercial planes for war as a temporary Colombian Air Force. The first attack by the Colombian Navy was on Tarapacá. The city was chosen because Leticia was on the border with Brazil, and the Colombian Forces preferred to attack a softer target rather than the well-defended Peruvian positions in and around the city. The retaking of Tarapacá was bloodless due to the fact that once the Colombian troops disembarked, the Peruvians fled the place abandoning their meager supplies, which included weapons stationed for defense, and to old cannons. The garrison was in terrible condition; letters and notes left by the soldiers attested to the despair in which they were due to the weather and the lack of food. Demoralized, without air defense, faced with the threat of bombers from the Colombian Air Force, the commander of the plaza ordered the withdrawal. In the Colombian ranks there was not a single casualty. The only skirmish took place at the site called Buenos Aires, when a picket of Colombian soldiers ran into a company of Peruvian troops who also left the area and force marched towards Leticia. On March 26, 1933, the Colombian Army attacked the Peruvian base at Guepi. The attack took by surprise the ill- prepared Peruvian troops who were unable to resist the attack. After prolonged combat in which the commander of the garrison withdrew from the zone, the Colombians claimed the position. There were 27 dead, 14 wounded and 24 prisoners. The Colombian ranks had 16 casualties and 13 wounded. The persecution in the jungle had to be suspended the next day due to the fatigue of the troops and the lack of proper marching rations. The advance on Iquitos seemed difficult, given the resistance that was predicted on the road to Iquitos and the state of the Colombian troops that already accused the rigor of the jungle, while a longer delay could benefit the sending of more reinforcements to Putumayo. This discussion was settled by a decision of the League of Nations that ordered a cease-fire at a time when, in any case, the military advance Colombian seemed to have favorable points: a Peruvian company composed of 93 men under the command of Captain Manuel Balderrago, surrendered without fire a single shot before a small scouting party with a dozen soldiers who worked in the vicinity of the Güepí-Pantoja trail under the orders from Captain Pompilio Duarte and Second Lieutenant Guillermo Aldana. Intimidated by the Colombian picket, the Peruvians handed over 58 rifles, 3 machine guns and their ammunition. After doubts and consultations, Benavides agreed to evacuate the port of Leticia and hand over its administration to the League of Nations. An armistice interrupted the war and the way was opened to diplomacy. The end took place in Rio de Janeiro. The Colombian negotiating commission, composed of Roberto Urdaneta, Guillermo Valencia and Luis Cano, signed the agreement through which Leticia was recovered on June 19, 1934. On 14 February 1933, the Peruvian Air Force had attempted to bomb the Colombian Fleet, but most bombs had missed their targets.von Rauch 1984, p.6 The Peruvian forces in Leticia could not be forced to withdraw, but the events in Lima and the assassination of the Peruvian president changed the situation. The new Peruvian president ordered the undefeated Peruvian troops to leave Leticia. Part of Peru's Pacific fleet came through the Amazon River to engage in combat. ==Rio de Janeiro Protocol== On the same day, Colombian President Enrique Olaya broke off all relations with Peru because of the aerial attack. He ordered an attack on Leticia, but it was repelled by Peruvian troops. On 30 April 1933, Peruvian President Sánchez was shot dead; 15 days later, his successor, Óscar Benavides, met with the head of the Colombian Liberal Party, Alfonso López Pumarejo, to secure an agreement to turn Leticia over to a League of Nations commission. Colombia and Peru met in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to sign a peace treaty. In the Rio de Janeiro Protocol, Peru stated, \\"We sincerely deplore the events that occurred starting September, 1932. Specifically those that damaged our relationship with Colombia.\\" The Salomón-Lozano Treaty was also reaffirmed by the treaty. ==References== *von Rauch, Herbert. \\"A South American Air War...The Letcia Conflict.\\" Air Enthusiast.

It follows the biblical book verse by verse, only a few verses remaining without commentary. In the list of the old sedarim for the Bible, four sedarim are assigned to Ecclesiastes (beginning at 1:1, 3:13, 7:1, and 9:7); and Kohelet Rabbah was probably divided according to these sections. This appears from the phrase \\"Sidra tinyana\\" (\\"second seder\\") inserted between the comments to Ecclesiastes 6:12 and 7:1, and the phrase \\"Sidra telita'a\\" (\\"third seder\\") between the comments to Ecclesiastes 9:6 and 9:7. These phrases occur at the end of the second and third midrash sections, in the same way that \\"Selik sidra\\" indicates the end of sections in earlier editions of Ruth Rabbah and Esther Rabbah. The commentary to 3:12 having been lost, so is the phrase \\"first seder\\" that would likely have followed it. Nothing remains to indicate where one section ends and another begins, as there is no introductory remark to the commentary on 3:13. But an introduction is also lacking to the commentary on 7:1 and 9:7. ==Adaptations from earlier Midrashim== The author - dated to between the 6th-8th centuries - confined himself chiefly to collecting and editing, and did not compose new introductions to the sections. However, he extensively used the introductions found either in the earlier midrashim—Bereshit Rabbah, Pesikta Rabbati, Lamentations Rabbah, Leviticus Rabbah, Shir haShirim Rabbah—or in the collections from which those midrashim were compiled. This shows the important role which the introductions to the earlier midrashim played in the later midrashim, in that they served either as sources or as component parts of the latter. For introductions to commentaries on the Bible text and for homilies on the sedarim and Pesikta cycle, it was customary to choose texts occurring not in the Pentateuch, but chiefly in the Hagiographa, including Ecclesiastes. This, even in very early times, gave rise to an aggadic treatment of numerous passages in Ecclesiastes, which in turn furnished rich material for the compilation of Kohelet Rabbah. The longest passages in Kohelet Rabbah are the introductions to Pesikta Rabbati and Vayikra Rabbah, all of which the author used. Some introductions were abbreviated, and introductions from different midrashim were combined in a commentary on one passage of Ecclesiastes. For instance, the long passage on Ecclesiastes 12:1–7 is a combination of the introduction to Vayikra Rabbah 18:1 and the 23rd introduction in Lamentations Rabbah.ed. S. Buber, pp. 9a–12a Of the 96 columns which Kohelet Rabbah contains in the Venice edition,fols. 66c–90b nearly twentySpecifically, the commentaries to Ecclesiastes 1:1,3,5,18; 2:2,12b,21,23; 3:1,11,15,16; 5:4,5,8,15; 6:7; 7:14, 23 et seq.; 8:1; 9:2,15; 10:20; 11:2,6; 12:1–7 consist of expositions which the author took from introductions in Bereshit Rabbah, Pesikta Rabbati, Vayikra Rabbah, and Shir ha-Shirim Rabbah. Many other passages besides the introductions have been transferred from those sources to Kohelet Rabbah. Moreover, it contains several passages in common with Ruth Rabbah; compare especially the commentary on Ecclesiastes 7:8 (which includes the story of Rabbi Meir and his teacher Elisha ben Abuya) with Ruth Rabbah 6 (to Ruth 3:13), with which it agrees almost verbatim. In this case, the story was not taken directly from its source in the Yerushalmi.Talmud Yerushalmi Hagigah 2 77b, c ==Passages from the Babylonian Talmud== Thirteenth-century Kohelet Rabbah manuscript from Cairo Geniza (1906 Jewish Encyclopedia) The author of Kohelet Rabbah of course frequently consulted the aggadah of the Jerusalem Talmud. At the same time, it may be assumed that various passages were taken directly from the Babylonian Talmud; and this assumption would prove the relatively later date of Kohelet Rabbah, though the end of the midrash (which is taken from Hagigah 5a) must be considered as an addition. A further characteristic indication of the late composition of the work is the fact that in the commentaries on Ecclesiastes 5:5 and 7:11 passages from Pirkei Avot are quoted, with a reference to this treatise,Compare Vayikra Rabbah 16 and in the commentary on 5:8 several minor tractates are mentioned. In the same commentary on 5:8, Kohelet Rabbah modifies a passage in a way which shows was written at a later time than the other midrashic works mentioned. In Vayikra Rabbah the passage reads: \\"Even what is superfluous on the earth is a part of the whole; and also the things which you regard as superfluous to the revealed Torah, such as the laws of tzitzit, Tefillin, and mezuzah, they also belong to the idea of the revealed Torah.\\"Vayikra Rabbah 22:1 In Kohelet Rabbah it reads: \\"The things which you regard as superfluous to the Torah, such as the tosafot of Rebbi's school and those of R. Nathan and the treatise on proselytes and slaves [\\"Hilkot Gerim va'Avadim\\"], they also were revealed to Moses on Mount Sinai, and treatises like 'Hilkhot Tzitzit Tefillin u-Mezuzot' belong to the sum total of the Torah.\\" As Zunz assumes,G. V. p. 266 Kohelet Rabbah belongs to the time of the middle midrashim. On the other hand, its author must not be charged with \\"proceeding entirely in the spirit of later compilers\\" merely because, in connection with certain Bible texts, he repeats accepted or approved passages which were written upon the same or similar texts. Such repetitions are frequently found in the earlier midrashim. In Kohelet Rabbah the same comments are found on Ecclesiastes 1:2 as on 6:12; on 1:3 as on 11:9; on 1:13 as on 3:10; on 3:16 as on 10:4; on 6:1 as on 9:13; and on 7:11 as on 9:10; and so on. Verses 2:24, 3:13, 5:17, 8:15 receive the same explanation; and the Epicurean and hedonistic view expressed in them—that for all of man's troubles his only compensation is the gratification of the senses: eating, drinking, and taking pleasure—is interpreted allegorically and given a religious significance: ==Examples of exegesis== The following passageEcclesiastes Rabbah 2:4-8 is an example of how in Kohelet Rabbah 1) the allegorical interpretation is connected with the simple literal interpretation; 2) the author, in order to explain a passage, has fused the material collected from different sources; 3) the author used stories and foreign words. The passage explains the description of Solomon's wealth (Ecclesiastes 2:4-8) in three different ways - as referring to Solomon's literal wealth, or to the Torah, or to the wealth that the Jewish people received upon settling its land. The Biblical text of Ecclesiastes is shown in italics: I made me great works - said Solomon: I made greater works than the works of my fathers; as it is written, 'The king made a great throne of ivory'.I Kings 10:18 I built me houses - as it is written, 'It came to pass at the end of twenty years, when Solomon had built the two houses.'I Kings 9:10 I planted me vineyards - as it is written, 'Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon'.Shir haShirim 8:11 I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all kinds of fruits - even peppers. R. Abba bar Kahana said: Solomon commanded spirits whom he sent to India to fetch water for watering... I made me pools of water: fish-ponds [πισκίνη] wherewith to water a forest full of trees;—this is the land of Israel; as it is written, \\"And the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon\\".I Kings 10:17 I got me servants and maidens - as it is written, \\"All the Nethinim, and the children of Solomon's servants, were three hundred ninety and two.\\"Nehemiah 7:60 I had servants born in my house; as it is written, \\"and those officers provided victual for King Solomon . . . they lacked nothing\\".I Kings 5:7 What does it mean that they lacked nothing? R. Hama bar Hanina said: At Solomon's table there were carrotsCompare Deuteronomy Rabbah 1:5 in summer and cucumbers in winter; they were eaten throughout the year. I had great possessions of great and small cattle; as it is writtenI Kings 5:3 \\"u-barburim abusim.\\" What does that mean? The scholars say, \\"Animals from Barbary\\" [Βαρβαρία]... I gathered me also silver and gold; as it is written, \\"And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones\\".I Kings 10:27 Is it possible?—like the stones on the roads and in the yards, and they were not stolen? No, there were stones eight and ten ells long. And the peculiar treasure of kings - as it is written, \\"And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon\\",II Chronicles 9:23—והמדינות [lit. \\"and of the provinces\\"] is to be read מדיינת [\\"the disputing woman\\"], that is, the Queen of Sheba, who disputed with him in her wisdom, and asked him questions, and could not vanquish him; as it is written, \\"She came to prove him with hard questions\\".I Kings 10:1 I gat me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men,—baths (δημόσια) and male and female demons [שדה, שדות, taken in the sense of שדים, \\"demons\\"] who heated them.' R. Hiyya bar Nehemiah said: Did Scripture intend to make us acquainted with Solomon's wealth? It probably refers only to the Torah: I made me great works - as it is written, \\"And the tablets were the work of God\\".Exodus 32:16 I built me houses—those are synagogues and schoolhouses. I planted me vineyards—those are the rows of scholars, who sit in rows [like vines] in the vineyard. I made me gardens and orchards—those are the great mishnayot, such as the mishnah of R. Hiyya Rabbah and that of R. Hoshaiah Rabbah, and that of Bar Kappara. I planted trees in them of all kinds of fruit—that is the Talmud, which is contained in them. I made me pools of water—those are the derashot. To water therewith the wood that brings forth trees—those are the children who learn. R. Naḥman said: That is the Talmud. To water therewith the wood that brings forth trees—those are the scholars. I got me servants and maidens—those are the nations; as it is written, \\"And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit\\".Book of Joel 3:2 [A. V. 2:29] And in the Messianic time the nations shall be subject to Israel; as it is written in Isaiah 61:5, \\"And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks.\\" And I had servants born [companions] in my house—that is the Holy Spirit. Also I had great possessions of great and small cattle—those are the sacrifices; as it is written, \\"From the cattle and sheep ye shall sacrifice\\".Leviticus 1:2 I gathered me also silver and gold—those are the words of the Torah; as it is written, \\"More to be desired are they than gold\\".Psalms 19:11 And the peculiar treasure of kings - as it is written, \\"By me kings reign\\".Proverbs 8:15 והמדינות is to be read מדיינין [\\"disputers\\"],—those are the scholars who debate the Halakhah. I gat me שרים ושרות—those are the toseftas. And the delights—those are the aggadot, which are the delights of Scripture. R. Joshua b. Levi interpreted the passage as referring to Israel on its entry into the country: I made me great works—\\"When ye be come into the land of your habitations... and will make a burnt offering... to the Lord\\".Numbers 15:2,3 I built me houses—\\"and houses full of all good things\\".Deuteronomy 6:11 I planted me vineyards—\\"vineyards and olive-trees which you did not plant\\". Hadrian the Accursed said to R. Joshua b. Hananiah: 'The Torah says: \\"A land wherein you shall eat bread without scarceness, you shall not lack anything in it\\".Deuteronomy 8:9 Can you bring me three things that I ask for?' 'What are they?' 'Pepper, pheasants [φασιανός], and silk [μέταξα].' He brought pepper from Nitzchanah, pheasants from Ẓaidan (Sidon), or, as another says, from Achbarin, and silk from Gush Halav. To water therewith the wood that brings forth trees - R. Levi said: The land of Israel did not even lack cane for arrows. I got me servants and maidens—\\"And a mixed multitude\\"Exodus 12:38 And had servants born in my house—those are the Gibeonites, whom Joshua turned into hewers of wood and drawers of water.(Joshua 9:27 I also had great possessions of great and small cattle—\\"a very great multitude of cattle\\".Numbers 32:1 I gathered me also silver and gold - as it is written, \\"He brought them forth also with silver and gold\\".Psalms 105:37 And the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces—that is the booty of Og and Midian.'\\" ==Versions== The Midrash Kohelet published by Solomon Buber in the Midrash Zuṭa in 1894 is different from the work discussed here. It is probably merely an extract with some additions. It is noteworthy that the author of Yalkut Shimoni knew only this midrash to Ecclesiastes, but in a more complete form than it is found in the printed edition. ==References== * ==Jewish Encyclopedia bibliography== * Zunz, G.

The Police Commissioner answers directly to the city mayor and outlines the departmental goals which are then enforced by the Deputy Commissioners. The Deputy Ops wields a great deal of power and is responsible for the day-to-day activity of the department's district and investigative unit commanders. The Administrative Deputy oversees the Internal Investigations Division (IID) and other units. The real life chain of command from the Commissioner downwards is Deputy Commissioner, Chief, Colonel, Lieutenant Colonel, Major, Captain, Lieutenant, Sergeant, and Detective/Officer. However, in the series, any mention of the ranks of Chief, Lieutenant Colonel, and Captain are omitted. Presumably this is to avoid confusion and make the relationships between different members of the hierarchy clearer to the viewer. Detectives fall into a rank that coincides with their administrative position. The Criminal Investigations Division (CID), commanded usually by a Colonel, is the division responsible for the Homicide unit, Narcotics unit, and Major Crimes Unit (MCU) among others. The IID, homicide unit, and narcotics unit are each led by a Major while MCU is commanded by a lieutenant. A Major commands each of the nine patrol districts - the Central, Northern, Northeastern, Eastern, Southeastern, Southern, Southwestern, Western and Northwestern districts. ===Department commanders=== William Rawls Rawls is Acting Commissioner on a temporary basis. Rawls is caucasian, and Mayor Tommy Carcetti is unwilling to attempt a permanent promotion fearing that it would not be acceptable to the politically influential and largely black ministers. Rawls is a careerist and is feared by many of his subordinates. He has been known to punish anyone who crosses him with transfers to undesirable posts. Rawls is played by John Doman. Cedric Daniels Daniels is the Deputy Commissioner of Operations. He is a direct commanding officer of many of the show's characters in earlier seasons. Daniels previously worked as a lieutenant in the Eastern District Drug Enforcement Unit, CID Narcotics Unit, and was the first commander of the MCU. Daniels is promoted to Major and Western District Commander after his successful case work in the MCU. He draws Carcetti's attention as a young and capable black commander and is quickly promoted to CID Colonel. He is eventually promoted to Police Commissioner, but resigns to practice law. Daniels is played by Lance Reddick. Stanislaus Valchek Valchek is the Deputy Commissioner of Administration. Valchek was previously the Southeastern District commander and his grudge against Frank Sobotka led to the formation of a specialised detail which became the Major Crimes Unit. Valchek is well connected with the city's politicians, and was promoted because of his political association with Mayor Carcetti. Valchek is played by Al Brown. Bobby Reed *Played by: Tony D.

He is very loyal to Ervin Burrell's command often more emphasized in protecting Burrell's command status than rigorously investigating individual officers. He often appears with discrediting evidence about officers for Burrell to use as blackmail. In the first season Reed investigates the brutality charges made against Roland \\"Prez\\" Pryzbylewski for blinding a teenager in one eye. Reed dismisses the witnesses based upon their criminal records but suspends Prez from street duty pending a Grand Jury hearing. Reed then intervenes when the Barksdale detail stop State Senator Davis' driver (who received a bag full of cash from a Barksdale soldier) and again when Daniels tries to withhold the location of a Barksdale stash house to protect his investigation. In the third season, Reed attends the weekly comstat meetings of Ervin Burrell and William Rawls. In the fourth season, Reed briefly appears when Burrell is contemplating the best method to keep his appointed position as commissioner. ===Former members=== Warren Frazier *Played by: Dick Stilwell *Appears in: :Season one: \\"The Hunt\\". Frazier is the Commissioner in season one. He gives the order for citywide raids following the shooting of Kima Greggs. As actor Dick Stilwell died in a real-life car accident after appearing in this single episode, his character is retired and replaced by Ervin Burrell as commissioner. Ervin Burrell Burrell is a by-the-book careerist officer who reached the level of Commissioner. Initially appointed as an Acting Commissioner, Burrell negotiated for a permanent posting with the Royce administration. When Carcetti replaced Royce he immediately began looking to depose Burrell. He is eventually forced to resign in a scandal over manipulation of crime statistics but receives a highly paid replacement job in order to leave quietly. Burrell is played by Frankie Faison.

According to Season 4, he served 39 years on the force suggesting he joined the BPD in 1967. When Judge Phelan questioned Deputy Commissioner Burrell about the Barksdale operation, it was Majors Foerster and Rawls who faced his subsequent wrath and demands for more information. Foerster's response was to ask his shift lieutenant Cedric Daniels for a report and he then assigned Daniels and his team to the Barksdale detail. When Daniels's investigation became drawn out and relied upon wiretaps and surveillance, Foerster took the side of Deputy Commissioner Burrell against Daniels when he tried to explain the necessity of this technique to reach the heads of the organization. Foerster's and Burrell's insistence on using buy busts led to the operation that resulted with the shooting of Detective Greggs. Foerster visited Greggs in the hospital with many other command officers and appeared anxious when trying to find a tape recorder to replay the last transmissions before she was shot. Foerster was promoted to colonel and took over as commander of the criminal investigations division when Rawls was promoted to deputy commissioner of operations. He was replaced as the Narcotics Major by George Smith, an associate of Major Colvin. He attended Rawls' weekly comstat meetings and worked with Sergeant Jay Landsman in running the homicide division. He was put under intense pressure to keep the murder rate down. Foerster continued to command CID in season four and was involved in the management of the murder of a state's witness that became a politically important case. Burrell ordered Foerster to replace veteran investigator Ed Norris with rookie homicide detective, Kima Greggs. Foerster realizes Burrell hopes to slow the investigation. He assumes Burrell's intent was to prevent the investigation from revealing the victim's witness status as a possible motive for the murder before the upcoming mayoral election. Foerster argues with Burrell and Rawls about the decision and discussed it with Jay Landsman. Actor Richard DeAngelis suffered from cancer during this time and was often absent from work. Repeated courses of chemotherapy failed to cure the disease. DeAngelis died of cancer after filming scenes for the fourth season. Landsman announced the Colonel's death to the homicide unit stating that he served 39 years in the department without leaving a trace of bitterness or hatred with any officers, a miraculous career by BPD standards. A police wake was held at an Irish bar in his honor. ==Major Crimes Unit== The Major Crimes Unit was established by Cedric Daniels in season three as part of a prior agreement with Commissioner Ervin Burrell. The unit's main responsibility is to build cases against high-profile targets responsible for murder, drug distribution and money laundering in Baltimore. The unit was originally formed by a group of detectives dumped upon Daniels by shift Lieutenants to make a case against Avon Barksdale. It is currently under the command of the Criminal Investigation Division and is run by Lester Freamon even though on paper it is commanded by Lieutenant Asher. In the first season the detail's office is located in the basement of a downtown building where the only redeeming features are working telephones and electricity. In the second season, the detail is moved into an old building located at 1911 South Clinton Street in the southeastern part of town leased by the Transportation Authority courtesy of Major Valchek. The office remains the permanent location of the unit when it is formed in season three. ===Current members=== Command Jimmy Asher *Played by: Gene Terinoni *Appears in: :Season four: \\"Boys of Summer\\"; \\"Home Rooms\\" and \\"That's Got His Own\\". :Season five: \\"More with Less\\" Asher is the lenient lieutenant who was picked to command the Major Crimes Unit by Cedric Daniels. He normally lets the detectives do as they wish while working on his beach house in Delaware. Lieutenant Charles Marimow replaced him for purposes of properly \\"supervising\\" the Major Crimes Unit under the orders of Deputy Commissioner Rawls. With Daniels' promotion to C.I.D. colonel, Asher is reinstalled as commander of the unit again as Freamon feels he will effectively let the detectives do what they need to make a case without interference from the commissioner's office. Lester Freamon Freamon is a quiet and methodical veteran detective who makes major contributions to the unit's investigations. He is the unit's de facto commander, as he lays out their investigative strategies and specifically chose Lieutenant Asher to be the shift Lieutenant due to his lenient, hands-off attitude. Detectives/Officers Kenneth Dozerman *Played by: Rick Otto *Appears in: :Season three: \\"Time After Time\\", \\"All Due Respect\\" and \\"Back Burners\\". :Season four: \\"Refugees\\", \\"Alliances\\", \\"Know Your Place\\", \\"Misgivings\\", \\"That's Got His Own\\" and \\"Final Grades\\". :Season five: \\"More with Less\\", \\"Clarifications\\", \\"Late Editions\\", and \\"–30–\\". Kenneth Dozerman is a plainclothes cop in the Western District. In season 3, he is part of Carver's Drug Enforcement Unit squad. He becomes friends with Herc and Carver while working in the squad accompanying them in various activities off duty. Dozerman gets shot in the face and critically injured in a buy bust operation gone wrong and gets decommissioned from duty for the rest of the season. Major Colvin uses Dozerman's shooting as the impetus for his \\"Hamsterdam\\" experiment, a way to reduce crime and not see any more of his men get hurt. The shooter also steals Dozerman's service weapon and Bunk Moreland is ordered to locate it. Dozerman is presented with it at a press conference. In season four, Dozerman transfers to the Major Crimes Unit when Herc transfers in, filling the gap left by Greggs and Freamon leaving. Dozerman takes part in Lieutenant Charles Marimow's first series of failed raids as unit commander. Following these raids he helps Herc to set up video surveillance of Marlo Stanfield. Dozerman remains in the unit as an ally to both Herc and Leander Sydnor, who mentor Dozerman on his investigative strategies. All three detectives maintain a dislike for Marimow's caustic command style often fearing the repercussions that he has threatened them with. Dozerman remains in the unit following Marimow's departure and Herc's suspension under the new leadership of Lester Freamon. In Season five, Dozerman is still with Major Crimes working with the detail on the row house serial murders. He still meets his old Western district DEU buddies for drinks along with Herc. After Major Crimes is disbanded, Dozerman is transferred to the Tactical division. Jimmy McNulty McNulty is known as “natural police” and ultimately whom the show centers around. He is dedicated and a highly driven Baltimore police detective but is riddled with many complicated personal problems, such as a ruined marriage, a series of flings with multiple women, and alcoholism. McNulty came up under the guidance of Bunny Colvin, a western district Major, who often refers to McNulty as “Bushytop” for McNulty’s wavy or curly locks of hair. McNulty is liked by non-commanding officers and is most friendly to Bunk and Kima Greggs. The first three seasons foundation story revolves around McNulty’s obsession with arresting Stringer Bell. Leander Sydnor Sydnor is a young, married detective in the Baltimore Major Crimes Unit with a talent for investigative work and the stomach for drawn-out cases. Sydnor has been part of the Major Crimes Unit throughout seasons one, three, and four of the show. ===Former members=== Command Cedric Daniels Daniels left the unit when he was promoted to Major, taking the District Commander post in the Western. Charles Marimow *Played by: Boris McGiver *Appears in season four: \\"Home Rooms\\", \\"Refugees\\", \\"Alliances\\", \\"Corner Boys\\", \\"Misgivings\\", \\"That's Got His Own\\". Bill Rawls installs Lieutenant Marimow as the commander of the Major Crimes Unit after Lester Freamon issues a series of subpoenas. Marimow attempts to change the unit's focus to the more obviously violent drug dealers and closes down their wiretaps on Marlo Stanfield. His caustic command style drives away Lester and Kima Greggs, leaving him with Leander Sydnor and Caroline Massey. His unit's staffing problems are relieved when Sergeant Herc Hauk transfers back. Dozerman joins him. Marimow and Herc develop an immediate mutual dislike. Marimow is one of the most disliked commanders, often referred to as a \\"Trojan Horse\\", \\"Virus\\" and a \\"Unit Killer\\". It is stated by Jay Landsman that \\"Marimow does not cast off talent lightly. He heaves it away with great force\\". Marimow is also unafraid to threaten his subordinates' careers as a means of punishing them for insubordination or similar defiance. He prides himself on being a streetwise commander and having worked his way up through the ranks. While Marimow has worked hard to earn his rank, his hostile command style has established his negative reputation throughout the department. He believes it would be easy to topple Marlo, but his first series of raids fail, as he underestimates his targets. Marimow orders his men to take Marlo down, leading Herc to break several rules by hiring a lip reader to spy on Marlo, and using a video camera without a court order or Marimow's approval. Marimow accurately suspects Herc of lying to him about the source of his information. Herc also has Internal Investigations Division (IID) complaints sent to the office for attempted arrests based on misinformation. Marimow vows to Herc that he would be happy to attend his \\"execution\\" at an IID trial if he could prove he was lying. Marimow leaves the Unit when Cedric Daniels becomes the Criminal Investigations Division colonel and reinstalls Lester and Asher. Show creator David Simon left the Baltimore Sun after a bitter feud with editor William K. Marimow. Simon chose to name an unsympathetic character after his old enemy.David Simon at My Nemesis (Stoop Storytelling Series) Thomas \\"Herc\\" Hauk Herc was a narcotics detective but his tendency towards brutality and acting without thinking held up his career progression as a member of the Barksdale and Sobotka details. To improve his chances of making sergeant he transferred to the Mayor's security detail. He returned to the Major Crimes Unit as a newly promoted sergeant. Herc is fired from the department after an Internal Investigation Division hearing. Detail members Ellis Carver A detective on Daniels narcotics shift who followed him into the Barksdale and Sobotka details. He left the detail in season 2 for a drug enforcement unit sergeant posting in the Western District. Patrick Mahon *Played by: Tom Quinn *Appears in season one: \\"The Detail\\"; \\"The Buys\\" and \\"Old Cases\\". Mahon was an elderly detective from the property unit who briefly worked with the Barksdale detail. Dubbed as a departmental \\"hump\\", he and his partner Polk had not made a single case in property crimes over their last ten years. The two were also regarded as a pair of drunks who were incapable of driving soberly. He is punched by Bodie Broadus, a young drug dealer, when the detail raid the low rise projects. Mahon takes early retirement following his injury, and is last seen encouraging Polk to do the same. Along with his counterpart Polk, his name is a reference to the Irish phrase \\"póg mo thóin\\" (\\"pogue mahone\\"), or \\"kiss my arse\\". Augustus Polk *Played by: Nat Benchley *Appears in :Season one: \\"The Detail\\"; \\"The Buys\\"; \\"Old Cases\\"; \\"The Pager\\" and \\"The Wire\\". :Season two: \\"Collateral Damage\\" (uncredited) and \\"Hot Shots\\" (uncredited). :Season five: \\"Late Editions\\". Polk was an aging detective from the property unit who worked briefly in the Barksdale and Sobotka details. He is often called \\"Auggie\\" by his partner Pat Mahon. He is generally regarded as a \\"hump\\", since he has not made a single case in property crimes over their last ten years. He is also an alcoholic. After his partner Mahon retired due to injury, Polk considers deliberately injuring himself to follow in his partner's footsteps. Unable to follow through on his plan, he becomes despondent and goes on a drinking binge. He misses several days' work and finally shows up drunk at 9am. Lieutenant Daniels tells him to take sick leave for his alcohol problem or work \\"wet\\". Polk opted for sick leave and is off until the case is closed. In the second season, he is briefly assigned to the first Sobotka detail under Lieutenant Grayson. When Major Valchek complains about the unit being full of humps, Daniels is put in command and Polk is moved back to property. In the ninth episode of the fifth season, Polk makes a small cameo, as the officer running the evidence control locker in one of the precincts. After helping Commissioner Daniels locate a crucial piece of evidence, Daniels tells Polk that he's \\"glad he landed okay\\". Displaying his usual sarcasm, Polk replies \\"Yeah...beats working\\". Michael Santangelo For a full character description see Western District section, below. Original Barksdale detail member partnered with Jimmy McNulty. He was dumped from homicide by Major Rawls for refusal to act as an insider in on Rawls' behalf. Santangelo took a post driving the narcotics wagon in the Western District. Unit members Shakima \\"Kima\\" Greggs Daniels' protege who mentored Herc and Carver while in Narcotics. She transferred to homicide when Lieutenant Marimow came into the unit as he was a caustic commander who was difficult to work for. When Marimow left, she remained in homicide due to the higher pay. Roland \\"Prez\\" Pryzbylewski Prez was the son-in-law of deputy commissioner Stan Valchek who had a knack for tracing phone patterns and money accounts but was inept on the streets. Prez left the department after accidentally shooting a plainclothes black officer Derrick Waggoner. Caroline Massey *Played by: Joilet F. Harris *Appears in :Season three: \\"Time After Time\\"; \\"All Due Respect\\"; \\"Dead Soldiers\\"; \\"Reformation\\" and \\"Middle Ground\\". :Season four: \\"Boys of Summer\\"; \\"Soft Eyes\\"; \\"Refugees\\". Officer Massey joined the show in season three as a member of the Major Crimes Unit under Lieutenant Cedric Daniels. Massey is a world-weary officer with a penchant for sarcasm and cutting coupons. She was particularly adept at deciphering the slang used by Barksdale drug dealers on wiretaps of cellular phones. Her diligent work manning wiretaps earned the respect of Lester Freamon when she was part of his successful undercover operation to supply pre-wiretapped phones to the Barksdale organization. In season four, Massey continued to work with the Major Crimes Unit and settled into her role. When the unit was assigned Lieutenant Marimow as a commander, Freamon transferred out. Massey and Sydnor were left to face Marimow closing down their wiretaps and ordering raids on weeks old targets. ==Homicide unit== The Homicide Unit of the Baltimore City Police Department is responsible for the investigation of all unexplained deaths that take place within Baltimore City. They are also responsible for investigating all police-related shootings, and, because the homicide unit is generally regarded as containing the best detectives on the police force, they are often given high-profile cases which are not necessarily homicides. A clearance rate of 50% or more for the year is aimed for and the Unit is among the most demanding in the Criminal Investigations Division. Sergeant Landsman's squad is typically the focus of the show, though there is at least one other squad (according to David Simon's book, there are typically three homicide squads in Baltimore, on rotating shifts). The unit is under the C.I.D. supervision of Rawls in season 2, then Raymond Foerster from the start of season 3 until Foerster's death from cancer, at which point the role is taken over by Cedric Daniels. Like the real department described in David Simon's Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets, the unit uses a red-black system of tracking cases where red is the color for an open/not cleared case and black is the color for a closed/cleared case. Additionally similar slang such as \\"dunkers\\" (easy cases), \\"whodunits\\" (difficult cases), and \\"redball\\" (media attention gaining cases) are used to describe the various cases. Victims who are not associated with the drug trade or other crime are often referred to as \\"taxpayers\\". A running practical joke within the unit is that if a detective is caught sleeping at his desk, his necktie will be cut off with scissors and pinned to a \\"necktie mausoleum\\". Detectives often fall asleep in the office (or on stakeout) because of the overtime demands and have at times worked double and triple shifts as they have dealt with multiple murders. This is used most prominently in the third season, where Bunk is shown cutting Crutchfield's tie, and later Crutchfield gets to repay the favor. ===Current members=== Jay Landsman Landsman is a squad sergeant in the homicide unit who must divide his loyalties between his men and his superiors. Frank Barlow *Played by: Michael Stone Forrest *Appears in: :Season one: \\"The Target\\" :Season five: \\"Not for Attribution\\", \\"Took\\" (uncredited), \\"Clarifications\\" Frank Barlow is a Caucasian detective in the homicide unit who first appeared as the primary detective at the trial of D'Angelo Barksdale. Despite having two witnesses, D'Angelo is found not guilty due to witness intimidation in the court room. Barlow appears later in the series with open murders of homeless men that McNulty ties into his fabricated serial killer. Barlow then sees that McNulty is falsifying paper work on the homeless murders case to provide resources for detectives to investigate unrelated cases. Barlow blackmails McNulty into providing funds for him to take a long weekend to play golf in South Carolina. Christeson *Played by: Dennis Hill *Appears in: :Season five: \\"More with Less\\", \\"Took\\", \\"Clarifications\\", \\"Late Editions\\" and \\"–30–\\". Christeson is a young black detective who is the homicide unit's newest detective. He first appears assisting Bunk and Norris on a \\"polygraph-by-copier\\" where an idiotic suspect confesses to a homicide. Christeson is the first detective whom Jimmy McNulty covers for the \\"homeless killer\\" and he is granted overtime to solve a case which the department's upper command interferes with. Michael Crutchfield *Played by: Gregory L. Williams *Appears in: :Season three: \\"Back Burners\\", \\"Moral Midgetry\\", \\"Slapstick\\" and \\"Mission Accomplished\\". :Season four: \\"Home Rooms\\", \\"Soft Eyes\\", \\"Refugees\\", \\"Alliances\\", \\"Margin of Error\\", \\"Unto Others\\", \\"Corner Boys\\", \\"A New Day\\" and \\"Final Grades\\". :Season five: \\"More With Less\\", \\"Unconfirmed Reports\\", \\"Not for Attribution\\", \\"Took\\", \\"Clarifications\\", and \\"–30–\\". Crutchfield is a detective in the homicide unit whose name is mentioned earlier in the series but who does not appear on screen until season three. He was the primary detective at the murder that took place in Major Colvin's \\"free zone\\" and withheld the investigation at Colvin's request. Colvin then helped create a \\"dunker\\" case having his suspect turned in after threatening the drug dealers in the \\"free zone\\". In season four, Crutchfield plays a bigger role appearing with Vernon Holley getting an identification of Omar Little as a murder suspect from Old Face Andre. When Bunk Moreland wants to re-examine the case, Crutchfield displays his anger over Bunk wanting to reverse one of his clearances. Crutchfield then promises to reverse a clearance of Bunk's as payback for going back on a solved case. When Carver leaves a message for Bunk, Crutchfield deliberately throws it away, causing a lengthy delay in the discovery of the bodies being left all over the city by the Stanfield Organization, and also indirectly ruining Randy Wagstaff's life in the process. Crutchfield ends season four investigating murders at the hands of the Stanfield Organization. In season five Crutchfield remains with Sergeant Jay Landsman's homicide squad. Crutchfield helps Bunk to manipulate a confession from DeShawn Williams. Crutchfield buys Monell, another involved party, a McDonald's meal and parades the boy in front of Bunk's interrogation room to lead Bunk's suspect to believe his friend had turned against him. When departmental cut backs lead to withholding of overtime Crutchfield secures part-time work as a security guard to replace his lost pay. Crutchfield is later assigned along with Kima Greggs to Chris Partlow and Snoop's triple murder of Junebug, Junebug's partner, and bodyguard. According to Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets, there was actually a caucasian detective in the Baltimore Police Department homicide division named Michael Crutchfield. Shakima \\"Kima\\" Greggs Greggs is a tenacious investigator and a rookie homicide detective. She was a key member of the Major Crimes Unit and proved herself on both the Barksdale and Sobotka investigations. She struggles to balance her life as a police officer with her role as a potential mother with her partner. Vernon Holley *Played by: Brian Anthony Wilson *Appears in: :Season one: \\"The Wire\\" and \\"The Hunt\\". :Season two: \\"Port in a Storm\\" (uncredited). :Season three: \\"All Due Respect\\" (uncredited), \\"Dead Soldiers\\", \\"Hamsterdam\\"; \\"Slapstick\\"; \\"Reformation\\" and \\"Mission Accomplished\\". :Season four: \\"Soft Eyes\\", \\"Alliances\\", \\"Margin of Error\\", \\"Unto Others\\", \\"Corner Boys\\", \\"A New Day\\" and \\"Final Grades\\". :Season five: \\"React Quotes\\", \\"The Dickensian Aspect\\", \\"Took\\", and \\"–30–\\". Holley is a detective in the homicide unit under the command of Bill Rawls, and later Raymond Foerster followed by Cedric Daniels. Holley often works with Norris, Bunk, or Crutchfield and is one of the unit's more short tempered and physically intimidating detectives. He first appears with partner Ed Norris and catches the case of the murder of Omar Little's boyfriend Brandon. They recognize a connection to the recent murder of Omar's crew member Bailey because both corpses are found in Kevlar vests. They call in Jimmy McNulty and the Barksdale detail's work secured a conviction for the murder against soldier Wee-Bey Brice. Following the shooting of detective Kima Greggs, Holley tracks down Bubbles paging her from a payphone. Holley assumes he is a suspect and has uniformed officers bring him in for an interrogation. Believing Bubbles to be the shooter, Holley tries to interrogate Bubbles in an accusatory and threatening manner and when Bubbles is unable to respond to his questions, Holley quickly loses his temper and tries to beat a confession out of him. Once McNulty intervenes, the situation is cleared up and Holley lies about Bubbles trying to attack him as a means of justifying the beating. In season two, Holley is briefly seen investigating the murder of Frank Sobotka. In season three he is assigned to investigate the murder of Tosha Mitchell and Tank and later the shooting of Stringer Bell, both working with Bunk Moreland. During this season, he is also seen called to duty for other investigations as the city's homicide rate rapidly approaches 300 murders for the year. In season four, Holley initially works as the secondary investigator on Norris' case of a murdered state's witness named Braddock that becomes a \\"red ball\\" case. Later in that investigation, he is replaced by Kima Greggs for political reasons. Holley and Crutchfield are then seen catching the case of a delivery woman murdered by Chris Partlow in Old Face Andre's convenience store. They interview Andre, who quickly (as ordered by Chris) identifies Omar Little as the killer in a photo array. When Omar is arrested he manages to convince Bunk Moreland he is innocent and Bunk asks Crutchfield and Holley to re-open the case. Crutchfield refuses to entertain the idea but Holley agrees that Andre is a possible drug dealer and goes with Bunk to the crime scene reluctantly. At the scene revisitation, Bunk views evidence confirming Omar's innocence in the shooting as he states that Andre's store is a drug stash house, Andre's story makes no sense, and in addition to his fear of Chris, he was likely willing to implicate Omar for ripping off his stash. Holley and Bunk then reappear with a grand jury summons where at the courtroom, Holley manages to intimidate Andre both physically and legally to have him confess his role in lying about the murder. Holley ends Season 4 assisting Crutchfield, Norris, and Bunk in the investigations of murders caused by Marlo Stanfield's crew. According to Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets, there was actually a black detective in the Baltimore Police Department homicide division named Vernon Holley. The real life Holley has worked in security for the Baltimore Ravens. William \\"Bunk\\" Moreland Bunk is a well liked and proficient member of the homicide unit. Although he is a capable detective, Bunk is a known alcoholic with a penchant for infidelity. Ed Norris *Played by: Ed Norris *Appears in: :Season one: \\"The Wire\\", \\"The Cost\\", \\"The Hunt\\" and \\"Sentencing\\". :Season two: \\"Stray Rounds\\" :Season three: \\"Time After Time\\", \\"All Due Respect\\" and \\"Dead Soldiers\\". :Season four: \\"Boys of Summer\\", \\"Soft Eyes\\", \\"Alliances\\" (uncredited), \\"Margin of Error\\", \\"Unto Others\\", \\"A New Day\\" and \\"Final Grades\\". :Season five: \\"More With Less\\", \\"Transitions\\", \\"React Quotes\\", \\"The Dickensian Aspect\\" (uncredited), \\"Took\\", and \\"–30–\\". Norris is a homicide detective who has been in the unit for 15 years since 1991 according to Season 4. Norris and his squad mate Vernon Holley first appeared assigned to the case of the murder of Omar Little's boyfriend Brandon. They recognized a connection to the recent murder of Omar's crew member Bailey because both corpses were found in Kevlar vests. They called in their colleague Jimmy McNulty and the Barksdale detail's work secured a conviction for the murder against soldier Wee-Bey Brice. Norris was also lead detective on the shooting of Wendell \\"Orlando\\" Blocker and Kima Greggs this time working with Detective Ray Cole. This case was also solved when Wee-Bey confessed to the shooting. In season two he appeared briefly when investigating the shooting of a child by a stray bullet. In season three he attended the wake of his colleague Ray Cole. Norris remains with the homicide unit in season four when he is the lead investigator in the politically important murder of a state's witness. He is briefly taken off the case and replaced with Greggs, now a rookie in the squad, in order to slow progress because of pressure from the Mayor. Norris is soon reinstated when this story is leaked to the press. He works alongside Greggs to maintain a coverup story that they were always working together. Norris secures an informant for the witness murder, but his attempt to break the story right before the election leads to him and Greggs being sent off to a security detail at a polling station for the day. Norris continues to pursue this lead after the election, however Greggs solves the case with a careful recanvassing of the crime scene before he is able to make progress. She earns Norris' respect with her work although he responds to the knowledge that the shooting was random with incredulity because of the political ramifications it had. Norris is played by ex-police commissioner of Baltimore and convicted felon Ed Norris. His cameo appearances are a source of irony on the show, and he is often given dialogue bemoaning the state of the Baltimore Police Department. Winona *Appears in: :Season two: \\"Ebb Tide\\", \\"Hard Cases\\" :Season three: \\"Dead Soldiers\\", Mission Accomplished (uncredited) :Season four: \\"Soft Eyes\\", \\"Refugees\\", \\"Corner Boys\\"; \\"Know Your Place\\", \\"A New Day\\", \\"Final Grades\\". Winona is a recurring background character who maintains The Board at the offices of the BPD Homicide Division. She is a middle-aged black woman with a distinctive, bouffant hairdo. Detective McNulty greets her by name in episode 14. ===Former members=== Ray Cole *Played by: Robert F. Colesberry *Appears in: :Season one: \\"The Target\\" (uncredited); \\"The Detail\\" (uncredited); \\"The Wire\\" (uncredited); \\"The Cost\\" (uncredited); \\"The Hunt\\" (uncredited); \\"Sentencing\\" (uncredited). :Season two: \\"Ebb Tide\\" (uncredited); \\"Collateral Damage\\" (uncredited); \\"Undertow (uncredited); \\"Stray Rounds\\" (uncredited). Ray Cole was a somewhat inept member of Sergeant Landsman's homicide squad under the command of William Rawls. Cole was the lead investigator of the death of Anton \\"Stinkum\\" Artis. His colleague Bunk Moreland told him that there was information about the case as part of a wiretap investigation that Bunk's partner Jimmy McNulty was involved in. The information would jeopardize the wiretap so they promised they would give it to Cole when the case closed. McNulty never intended to give Cole the information because the perpetrator was his informant Omar Little. Cole was secondary investigator on the shooting of Wendell \\"Orlando\\" Blocker and Detective Kima Greggs. Cole achieved a clearance in the case working alongside lead investigator Detective Ed Norris when the case was solved with a confession from Wee-Bey Brice. Cole was initially assigned the fourteen Jane Doe homicides that Rawls had tried to avoid. Jimmy McNulty was responsible for proving the cases fell under Rawls' jurisdiction. McNulty called Cole collateral damage when discussing Cole's misfortune with Bunk. Landsman reassigned the case to Bunk and Lester Freamon because he felt he needed his most capable detectives on it. Cole died unexpectedly and the department held a wake for him. Landsman gave a eulogy for Cole at the wake. Cole was played by the show's executive producer, Robert F. Colesberry, who died unexpectedly of complications from heart surgery. The character's wake was in part a tribute to Colesberry. In all subsequent seasons, the opening titles showed Cole's photo next to his coffin at the wake. Lester Freamon Freamon is a methodical detective who was very skilled at homicide investigations but was once kicked out of the unit for angering the Deputy of Operations. He was let back in by William Rawls on two occasions transferring out on both to be of more assistance in leading the Major Crimes Unit. Freamon is a methodical and competent homicide detective who was exiled to the Pawn Shop Unit – for thirteen years (and four months) – for angering the then-Deputy of Operations. He was transferred to the Barksdale detail in Season One, later returning twice to the Homicide unit. Jimmy McNulty McNulty was one of the homicide unit's better detectives until his insubordination drew the ire of his commander Major Rawls. Rawls had him transferred out of homicide at the end of season one, although he did return in Season Five. William Rawls Rawls was a Major in homicide promoted to Criminal Investigations Division Colonel and then Deputy Commissioner of Operations. He was a ruthless and feared commander of the unit who expected nothing less than unwavering loyalty and competence from his detectives. ==Western District== The Western District (along with the Eastern District as shown in Season 3) of the Baltimore Police Department is one of the city's most violent districts and is located in the middle of West Baltimore at 1034 North Mount Street. The Western District has been examined in greater depth than any other on The Wire and was the center of the major investigations in seasons one, three and four. ===Current staff=== Command Currently, the Western District is administered by Major Dennis Mello, former deputy to Howard Colvin, who was forced into retirement. Dennis Mello *Played by: Jay Landsman *Appears in: :Season 2: \\"Stray Rounds\\" (uncredited). :Season 3: \\"Time After Time\\"; \\"All Due Respect\\"; \\"Dead Soldiers\\"; \\"Hamsterdam\\"; \\"Straight and True\\"; \\"Homecoming\\"; \\"Back Burners\\"; \\"Reformation\\"; \\"Middle Ground\\" and \\"Mission Accomplished\\". :Season 4: \\"Boys of Summer\\"; \\"Margin of Error\\"; \\"Misgivings\\"; \\"A New Day\\"; \\"Final Grades\\". :Season 5: \\"More With Less\\", \\"Took\\" Mello first appeared on the series as Western District administrative lieutenant and Major \\"Bunny\\" Colvin's second in command and confidante before Colvin's forced retirement. Mello then ran the district until Major Daniels was named district commander. Mello ran briefings for the Western district at roll call maintaining a sense of humor, typically dismissing the men with \\"don't get captured\\" and jokingly referring to them as \\"humps\\" and \\"mopes\\". Mello was once again given command of the Western district after Daniels' promotion to C.I.D. colonel at least until a new Major is given district command. Incidentally, the actor who plays Dennis Mello is a retired Baltimore detective named Jay Landsman, and was the real-life basis for the character of the same name in the show. Mello appeared with Colvin during the accidental shooting of a nine-year-old child going off of Colonel Rawls' command to shake the district down for all known drug dealers to get a murder suspect. Mello comments that it was too bad a child had to die before locking all the drug dealers up while Colvin questions what it is they are really doing. He accompanied Colvin to comstat meetings. Mello was aware of Colvin's \\"Hamsterdam\\" free zone where he allowed drug dealing to go unpunished. Mello was worried, but did not report Colvin's actions to his superiors. Colvin protected Mello following the discovery of Hamsterdam by their superiors and after Colvin's departure, Mello was temporarily promoted to Western District Commander. The two remained friends. In season four Mello returned to his post of administrative lieutenant as Major Daniels was granted the district commander post. Mello worked closely with Daniels and the two tried to convince Officer McNulty to take a position in their operations unit. Both rated his capabilities highly but could not convince him to leave his position in patrol. Daniels, however, remembering McNulty's past insubordination, viewed McNulty's position as a patrolman as a self-redeeming job and was more understanding of McNulty's desire to work as a patrolman. Mello was given command of the Western district again when Daniels was promoted to Criminal Investigations Division colonel. Mello continues to give charismatic roll call briefings including readying his men for polling station duty and introducing the murder warrant for Omar Little. When Commissioner Burrell tried to reassert his command of the force by \\"juking the stats\\", the district commanders were told to increase the number of arrests in their districts whether they be felonies or minor infractions. After seeing his officers at work, he went to Daniels to discuss the orders patrol had been given. Mello was personally opposed to this statistical posturing claiming that while the troops were increasing the minor infraction arrests, they were locking up the neighborhood people in the process. Claiming that half of his officers felt the same way, he then asked who they were doing this for as the election was over. Daniels informed Mayor Carcetti who then initiated a new order for the department to no longer make arrests based on statistical quotas but rather quality felonies, something Daniels had been lobbying for. Mello then was later seen commanding the Western troops to do the complicated (by Baltimore Police standards which Mello jokingly states is uncomplicated only if officers went to college or were born by women who did not drink alcohol while they were pregnant) task of searching empty homes for bodies at the request of former district major Cedric Daniels and detective Lester Freamon. The character is named after a real-life Captain Dennis Mello, who was the Western District commander when Ed Burns was an officer. Ellis Carver Sergeant Carver is SIC (Sergeant in Charge) of the Western District under Major Mello. At the end of the series Carver is promoted to Lieutenant. Uniformed Patrolmen Brian Baker *Played by: Derek Horton *Appears in :Season three: \\"Time After Time\\"; \\"All Due Respect\\" :Season four: \\"Misgivings\\"; \\"A New Day\\" (uncredited). :Season five: \\"Took\\" (uncredited) Baker is a rookie patrolman assigned with Castor to the Western District under the command of Bunny Colvin in Season three. He and Castor are both forced by Colvin to carry a compass until they can correctly identify the north direction. In Season four, Baker teams with officer Jimmy McNulty to arrest two people for a string of felony church burglaries. McNulty allows him credit for the arrest, later concurring with Bunk Moreland that Baker could be \\"good police\\". Bobby Brown *Played by: Bobby J. Brown *Appears in :Season one: \\"The Target\\" (uncredited); \\"The Wire\\" (uncredited) and \\"The Cost\\" (uncredited). :Season three: \\"Middle Ground\\" (uncredited). :Season four: \\"Refugees\\"; \\"Know Your Place\\"; \\"Misgivings\\"; \\"A New Day\\" (uncredited). :Season five: \\"More With Less\\"; \\"Unconfirmed Reports\\"; \\"Clarifications\\"; \\"Late Editions\\"; and \\"–30–\\". Bobby Brown is a Western District uniformed officer. He was the first officer on scene at the shooting of William Gant. He was also at the Brandon Wright crime scene. Detective Jimmy McNulty later enlisted Brown to help watch the home of Wallace. In season 3 when Major Colvin institutes the Hamsterdam initiative Brown is one of the officers freed up to be assigned to investigate complaints rather than perform radio car patrols and he solves a church burglary case. Brown was later present with Sergeant Ellis Carver to both warn and arrest Namond Brice for selling drugs on a pre-indicted corner. In season five Brown is livid about the withholding of his overtime pay and is insubordinate in Carver's first roll-call briefing as Sergeant in charge. Brown is involved in a parking lot brawl with another officer over the poor state of a vehicle he hands over. Later, Brown is the first officer at a suspicious death that is investigated by Detective McNulty—the death is later ruled natural as predicted by Brown and McNulty. Brown's character is the same Baltimore police officer also called Bob Brown, played by the same featured in David Simon's miniseries, The Corner. Bobby J. Brown is also featured in The Corner as another officer. Aaron Castor *Played by: Lee E. Cox *Appears in :Season three: \\"Time After Time\\"; \\"All Due Respect\\" and \\"Moral Midgetry\\" (uncredited) :Season five: \\"More With Less\\"; \\"Unconfirmed Reports\\" Castor is a rookie patrolmen, assigned with Baker to the Western District under the command of Howard Colvin in season three. He and Baker are both ordered by Colvin to carry a compass until they can correctly identify the north direction. He is apparently the nephew of former Baltimore Police officer Lloyd Castor, whom Major Colvin has dubbed as \\"good police\\". In season five Castor is first seen warning his new Major, Dennis Mello, about a brawl in the district parking lot. Later, Castor is the first officer at the triple homicide of Junebug and his wife and associate investigated by Detective Kima Greggs. Castor fails to notice a child hiding in a closet when he secures the scene and Greggs hears the child when she arrives. Michael Santangelo *Played by: Michael Salconi *Appears in :Season one: \\"The Target\\"; \\"The Detail\\"; \\"The Buys\\"; \\"Old Cases\\"; \\"The Wire\\"; \\"One Arrest\\"; \\"Game Day\\"; \\"The Cost\\"; \\"The Hunt\\"; \\"Cleaning Up\\" and \\"Sentencing\\". :Season two: \\"Port in a Storm\\". :Season three: \\"Dead Soldiers\\"; \\"Straight and True\\"; \\"Homecoming\\"; \\"Slapstick\\" and \\"Mission Accomplished\\". :Season four: \\"Boys of Summer\\"; \\"Margin of Error\\"; \\"Misgivings\\"; \\"A New Day\\". :Season five: \\"Transitions\\", \\"Took\\", and \\"–30–\\". Mike \\"Sanny\\" Santangelo is an Italian American officer responsible for driving the district arrest van in the Western District. In season one, Santangelo is an eight-year veteran in the Homicide Unit. Santangelo is, along with McNulty, assigned to the Barksdale detail by Rawls, to spy on McNulty. This also allows Rawls to unburden himself of one of his more inept homicide detectives, as Santangelo has a clearance rate of less than 40%, with his excuse for his performance being a lack of easy cases. He tries to resist, saying that it isn't his job to inform on a fellow cop, so Rawls orders him either to solve one of his open cases, all of which are difficult cases, inform on McNulty or leave the Homicide Unit altogether. Landsman eventually recommends a psychic, \\"Madame LaRue\\", and Santangelo, in desperation, follows her instructions to bury a doll in the murder victim's grave. That evening, McNulty solves another of the open cases, and Santangelo, though pleased, doesn't understand why a different case was solved. Landsman tells him that the psychic was meant as a joke and that Bunk and McNulty did his work for him. With the clearance, Santangelo is able to refuse Rawls' demands and is grateful enough to tell McNulty that Rawls wants him fired. Santangelo is demoted to patrol officer at the end of season one for failing to give Rawls any more information. In season two, he is seen briefly as a beat officer, arresting Bubbles and Johnny when they try to steal medical supplies from an ambulance. In season three, he drives the Western district prisoner transport vehicle under the command of Major Colvin. When he encounters former Barksdale detail members McNulty and Kima Greggs, Santangelo mentions that he is happy at being a patrolman as his job is easier: he is no longer a detective, he no longer deals with difficult commanders like Rawls and still takes home the same pay and pension contributions. He remains a patrolman in the Western District in season four, when McNulty transfers in alongside him. During a counter-terrorism seminar, he was the first officer to point out the uselessness of Western District officers learning anti-terrorism tactics in a crime ridden district. Santangelo is also one of several officers present for the arrest of Omar Little on a murder warrant. Eddie Walker *Played by: Jonnie Louis Brown *Appears in: Season four: \\"Soft Eyes\\"; \\"Refugees\\"; \\"Margin of Error\\"; \\"Unto Others\\"; \\"Misgivings\\"; \\"A New Day\\". Walker is a corrupt black patrolman in the Western District. He is a violent bully, who is feared and loathed by Namond, Michael, and the other young drug dealers in the area, and several times is seen brutalizing them. He is first seen stealing money from Randy and later he steals bootleg DVDs from Bubbles, after Bubbles attempted to report a robbery. He is the arresting officer for Omar Little, stealing a ring from him in the process. After Walker breaks Donut's fingers for giving him more paper work to do after a car chase, Michael orchestrates an act of revenge. When Walker exits a club late one night, Dukie runs down the sidewalk keying cars; Walker chases him into an alley, where Michael and Namond are waiting for him. Michael makes Walker drop to his knees at gunpoint and sees the ring that Walker stole from Omar (who stole it from Marlo, who took it from Old Face Andre); he takes it before Namond drenches Walker with paint. Walker tells fellow officers that he was attacked by Bloods. Walker's attitude earns him the respect of more zealous officers and the disdain of others, such as Jimmy McNulty. McNulty later describes Walker as an \\"asshole\\", while talking to Bodie Broadus. Plainclothes Officers Anthony Colicchio *Played by: Benjamin Busch :Season three: \\"Time After Time\\"; \\"All Due Respect\\"; \\"Dead Soldiers\\"; \\"Hamsterdam\\"; \\"Straight and True\\"; \\"Homecoming\\"; \\"Back Burners\\"; \\"Moral Midgetry\\"; \\"Slapstick\\" and \\"Mission Accomplished\\". :Season four: \\"Boys of Summer\\"; \\"Alliances\\" (uncredited); \\"Margin of Error\\"; \\"Misgivings\\"; \\"That's Got His Own\\" and \\"Final Grades\\". :Season five: \\"More With Less\\", \\"Transitions\\" Anthony \\"Tony\\" Colicchio is a narcotics officer in Sergeant Ellis Carver's drug enforcement unit squad in the Western District of Baltimore. He was often partnered with fellow squad members Herc Hauk and Lloyd \\"Truck\\" Garrick. Colicchio is part of the operation that resulted in the shooting of Officer Dozerman. Along with the rest of the squad, Colicchio is involved in policing drug tolerant zones set up by his district commander Major Colvin without the knowledge of his superiors. It is Colicchio who inspires the name Hamsterdam, after citing Amsterdam's liberal drug laws as a metaphor for Colvin's new policies. As Colicchio is zealously committed to using brute force to fight the war on drugs, he describes the drug-free zones as \\"moral midgetry.\\" Colicchio remains in Carver's squad in season four, and Carver tries to bring him around to his new way of doing things—getting to know the street dealers and cultivating informants. Colicchio takes part in Lieutenant Marimow's failed raids in the Western district. Colicchio is also present for the arrest of Omar Little on a murder warrant, relishing finally bringing in the legendary criminal. With his overzealous attitude, Colicchio is delighted to participate in the arrest hike ordered by Commissioner Burrell to appease the city's politicians. He appears outside a bar with other officers, causing a near riot with their \\"quality of life violation\\" arrests against people with open alcohol containers. (Major Colvin had compared \\"Hamsterdam\\" to the practice of not enforcing violations of open-container laws when the bottles were obscured by paper bags.) Colicchio's method of policing, however, supports the Broken Windows Theory. In season five, Colicchio remains in the Western District drug enforcement unit and continues to take a combative approach to his work. He is the subject of an Internal Investigation Division investigation after he attacks a teacher who had asked him to move a vehicle while he was making an arrest. Carver refuses to back Colicchio when he shows no remorse for his action, and actually charges him with conduct unbecoming an officer and excessive force. Colicchio accuses Carver of being a rat, but Carver is not deterred by the damage to his reputation. Colicchio is played by Benjamin Busch, who spent two tours of duty in Iraq with the U.S. Marine Corps. Lloyd \\"Truck\\" Garrick *Played by: Ryan Sands *Appears in: :Season three: \\"Time After Time\\"; \\"All Due Respect\\"; \\"Homecoming\\"; \\"Back Burners\\"; \\"Moral Midgetry\\"; \\"Slapstick\\"; \\"Reformation\\" and \\"Mission Accomplished\\". :Season four: \\"Boys of Summer\\"; \\"Alliances\\"; \\"Margin of Error\\"; \\"Corner Boys\\"; \\"Know Your Place\\"; \\"Misgivings\\"; \\"A New Day\\"; \\"That's Got His Own\\" and \\"Final Grades\\". :Season five: \\"More With Less\\"; \\"Clarifications\\"; \\"Late Editions\\" Lloyd \\"Truck\\" Garrick is a black narcotics officer in Sergeant Ellis Carver's squad in the Western District of the Baltimore Police Department, often partnered with fellow squad members Herc, Lambert and Colicchio. Garrick was part of the operation that resulted in the shooting of Officer Dozerman. Along with the rest of the squad Garrick was involved in policing drug tolerant zones set up by his district commander Howard \\"Bunny\\" Colvin without the knowledge of his superiors. He was with Herc when he phoned the paper to report Colvin's actions and again when he met with a reporter. In season 4, Truck appeared briefly at a useless lesson for Western police on counter-terrorism and once assisting Herc and Carver. In Season 5, Truck appears with the Western District officers who are frustrated by the lack of overtime pay due to city cutbacks. During Detective Jimmy McNulty's homeless killer case, McNulty has Western District Sergeant Ellis Carver detail officers to track Marlo Stanfield's crew including officers Brown, Dozerman, and Truck. Lambert *Played by: Nakia Dillard *Appears in: :Season three: \\"Time After Time\\"; \\"All Due Respect\\"; \\"Homecoming\\"; \\"Back Burners\\"; Reformation. Lambert is a black narcotics officer in Sergeant Ellis Carver's Drug Enforcement Unit in the Western District of the Baltimore Police Department, often seen with fellow squad members Herc, Anthony Colicchio, and Lloyd \\"Truck\\" Garrick. He was part of the operation that resulted in the shooting of Officer Dozerman. After Dozerman's shooting the D.E.U.'s hand-to- hand operations were suspended as Major Colvin did not want to see any more of his men come close to death over a minimal amount of drugs. ===Former staff=== Major Howard \\"Bunny\\" Colvin Colvin was the veteran Major and District commander who was forced out of the department due to his \\"Hamsterdam\\" experiment that de-criminalized drugs, despite this causing a reduction in felonies. Kenneth Dozerman Dozerman was a friend of Carver and Herc in the DEU that moved into the Major Crimes Unit in season 4. Thomas \\"Herc\\" Hauk A former D.E.U. member who was a partner of Ellis Carver. He left the Western District to work on the Mayor's security detail. Jimmy McNulty McNulty was a former beat officer who became a detective. He returned to patrol in season 4 but after the death of an informant, he rejoined the Homicide Unit. ==Others== The following are former officers or assistant police not part of a District, Administrative, or Criminal Investigation Division. ===Walter Cantrell=== *Played by: Dave Trovato *Appears in :Season one: \\"The Detail\\" and \\"Sentencing\\" (uncredited). :Season four: \\"Unto Others\\" (uncredited). Walter Cantrell is a major and the Southern District commander. He is first seen in season one where he is a lieutenant and commands Roland \\"Prez\\" Pryzbylewski and Leander Sydnor. Lieutenant Cedric Daniels bargains with Cantrell to have the highly competent Sydnor assigned to the Barksdale detail to compensate for taking the erratic Pryzbylewski. Cantrell and Daniels are both candidates for the next post of major, and because of Daniels' insubordination while conducting the Barksdale investigation, Cantrell receives the promotion at the end of the first season. He is seen again in season four commanding the Southern District and preparing new mayor Tommy Carcetti for a ride-along. ===Claude Diggins=== *Played by: Jeffrey Fugitt *Appears in season two: \\"Ebb Tide\\"; \\"Collateral Damage\\"; \\"Undertow\\"; \\"All Prologue\\"; \\"Duck and Cover\\"; \\"Storm Warnings\\" and \\"Port in a Storm\\". Diggins is a Baltimore police department Marine Unit officer who partners Jimmy McNulty when he is assigned to the unit. He advises McNulty on how to make the best of the situation, but McNulty hates the fumes. Diggins is forgiving of McNulty's time away from the unit and shares his own boat with Bunk Moreland and McNulty to pose as a fishing craft when observing Spiros \\"Vondas\\" Vondopoulos. He has a noticeable Baltimore accent . ===Randall Frazier=== *Played by: Erik Todd Dellums *Appears in :Season one: \\"The Detail\\"; \\"The Wire\\" :Season two: \\"Collateral Damage\\"; \\"Hot Shots\\" and \\"All Prologue\\" :Season three: \\"All Due Respect\\" Frazier is a Baltimore police department medical examiner. He is involved in the investigation of the death of William Gant. Later he was responsible for the autopsies of fourteen unidentified women found at the Baltimore docks. He helped Jimmy McNulty to prove that the deaths occurred in the city jurisdiction by establishing time of death based on the air supply in the container the bodies were discovered in. He also linked the bodies to a specific plastic surgery clinic by identifying a breast implant type that several of the women shared and tracing the serial number. This information helped the detectives to establish that the women were sex trade workers. ===Beadie Russell=== Russell is a port authority police officer and a single mother who develops an interest in case work following a chance discovery. ===Marvin Taylor=== *Played by: Barnett Lloyd *Appears in :Season three: \\"Time After Time\\"; \\"All Due Respect\\"; \\"Dead Soldiers\\" Taylor is a black Major who was the acting commander of the Eastern District. Under pressure from the Mayor's office, Ervin Burrell is told to start coming down on the department to reduce the crime rate by any means possible. As Taylor's district had a low number of felony arrests and handgun confiscations in addition to a high number of homicides in a very short period of time, Deputy Rawls angrily tells him that he had eight hours to get a grip on his district or he would be fired. Cedric Daniels and Jimmy McNulty then arrested an eastside drug dealer named \\"Cheese\\" whom they suspect of being responsible for some of the murders in his district. When insufficient evidence against \\"Cheese\\" or any other suspected murderers is present, Rawls berates him one last time at a Comstat meeting, after which Commissioner Burrell relieves Taylor of command. This is intended as an example to all the other commanders in the department, that if they did not improve their statistics they will also be replaced. ===Torret=== *Played by: Derren M. Fuentes *Appears in :Season one: \\"The Hunt\\", \\"Cleaning Up\\" :Season two: \\"Stray Rounds\\" :Season three: \\"Middle Ground\\", \\"Mission Accomplished\\" Lieutenant Torret is a black officer who appears in charge of the Quick Response Team (QRT) when they are required for raids and arresting criminals.

In Season 2, he appeared leading the raid on the Franklin Terrace towers when a nine-year-old child was accidentally shot and killed by a stray round in a shootout between drug dealers. In that raid he had the unit arrest everyone in \\"The Pit\\" as he assumed them a suspect for being around that area. In Season 3, he appeared at the rank of Major commanding QRT and Tactical units citywide no longer actively participating in the raids. He helped plan and lead the raid to shut down \\"Hamsterdam\\" at the orders of Deputy Rawls. He was present with Rawls finding the body of drug addict Johnny Weeks who was then taken to the morgue in a squad car as a means of preventing the media from linking the death to the \\"Hamsterdam\\" experiment. ==RelativesCheryl=== *Played by: Melanie Nicholls-King *Appears in :Season one: \\"The Target\\"; \\"Old Cases\\"; \\"The Cost\\"; \\"The Hunt\\" and \\"Sentencing\\". :Season two: \\"Ebb Tide\\"; \\"Hard Cases\\"; \\"All Prologue\\"; \\"Storm Warnings\\" and \\"Port in a Storm\\". :Season three: \\"All Due Respect\\" and \\"Back Burners\\". :Season four: \\"Know Your Place\\" :Season five: \\"Transitions\\", Cheryl is Kima Greggs' live-in partner; she works in the television news industry and often worries about Kima's safety as a police officer.

The lands of Lelmlair were made into a barony direct from the Crown in 1643 for Colonel John Munro of Lemlair who was a leading supported of the National Covenant and who opposed Charles I of England's church innovations. In 1738 the lands of Lemlair reverted to the chief of the Clan Munro and later went through a period of Mackenzie ownership when it was connected with the neighboring Mountgerald. It was later bought back by another member of the Munro family. The name \\"Lemlair\\" is thought to come from the Gaelic for \\"a bare place suitable for grazing horses\\". ===Rebuilding=== In 1859, it was bought from Sir Charles Munro of Foulis by \\"Red John\\" Munro and it was Red John's grandson, another John, who rebuilt it into the present mansion with its internal fittings featuring the Munro eagle in 1876. He moved into the house in 1879 and it has had only three owners since then. ===Lemlair today=== The mansion is set in of grounds. The building features a Rennie Mackintosh tiled fireplace and mantelpiece, a snooker room, a tiled-floor veranda overlooking the firth, a tennis court, eight bedrooms, stained-glass windows and Munro clan features such as a fireplace depicting the famous eagle emblem. The house has recently been extensively refurbished including exterior woodwork to bring the house back to original standard. The area boasts excellent fishing, shooting and stalking and countryside walks. ==References* Lemlair House Lemlair House Category:Houses completed in 1643 Category:Category B listed buildings in Highland (council area) Category:Listed houses in Scotland Category:1643 establishments in Scotland ","title":"Lemlair House"},{"id":"9075968","text":"The Best American Poetry 1993 book cover The Best American Poetry 1993, a volume in The Best American Poetry series, was edited by David Lehman and by guest editor Louise Glück. ==Poets and poems included== { - Poet  Poem  Where poem previously appeared - A.

He had two siblings: a sister, Gladys H. (8 years younger), and brother Reinhard S. (9 years younger). The Speck family was well-to-do, with live-in servants that included a German woman, Anna Muller, and a mixed Native American/African American woman, Gussie Giles from South Carolina. Around 1910, Frank married Florence Insley, from Rockland, New York, and they raised three children: Frank S., Alberta R., and Virgina C. Speck. The family lived in Swarthmore, Pennsylvania, also keeping a summer home near Gloucester, Massachusetts.Speck family data is drawn from the United States Census Records for: Brooklyn, New York (1880); Hackensack, New Jersey Ward 4, Bergen, New Jersey (1900); Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (1910); and Swarthmore, Delaware, Pennsylvania (1930 and 1940). As a young man, Frank developed an affinity for forests and swamps and wild landscapes, and for the Native people who lived in these locales. These interests inspired him to pursue anthropological studies. He was accepted into Columbia University in 1899. After working closely with professor and linguist John Dyneley Prince, who encouraged his interests in Native American Indian language and culture, he was introduced to anthropologist Franz Boas. Around 1900, during a summer camping trip to Fort Shantok, Connecticut, while on break from Columbia. Speck was surprised to encounter a group of Mohegan Indian young men about his own age. Burrill Fielding, Jerome Roscoe Skeesucks, and Edwin Fowler introduced him to about 80 other members of their tribe living in Uncasville, near Fort Shantok, in Mohegan, Connecticut.Gladys Tantaquidgeon, \\"Frank Speck,\\" unpublished reminiscence in the Gladys Tantaquidgeon Papers, Tantaquidgeon Indian Museum. Edited and reprinted as \\"An Affectionate Portrait of Frank Speck,\\" in Dawnland Voices: An Anthology of Indigenous Writing from New England. Siobhan Senier, ed. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press Speck took a particular interest in Fidelia Fielding, an elderly widow who (unlike most of her neighbors) still fluently spoke the Mohegan Pequot language. Modern sources suggest that Speck was raised by Fidelia,Loren Eiseley (c 1975), All The Strange Hours, “Though Frank’s mother was still living when I knew him, there had been a time in childhood when, in ill health, he had been entrusted to the care of an old Mohegan woman. Why this was i never completely understood, save that this foster mother was a family friend”. ch 9. pg. 92. Charles Scribner & Sons/ New York, but there is no evidence in Mohegan tribal records to support this notion.Melissa Tantaquidgeon Zobel (2018) \\"Forward.\\" In Savage Kin: Indigenous Informants and American Anthropologists, by Margaret M. Bruchac, pp. ix-xiii. Tucson: University of Arizona Press. There is, however, no question that Speck's \\"interests in literature, natural history and Native American linguistics\\" were inspired by his early encounters with Mohegan people.Margaret M. Bruchac (2018) \\"Indian Stories: Gladys Tantaquidgeon and Frank Speck.\\" In Savage Kin: Indigenous Informants and American Anthropologists, pp. 140-175. Tucson: University of Arizona Press. At Columbia University, Speck found his direction for life study as an anthropological ethnographer. He received his BA from Columbia in 1904, and proceeded to initiate fieldwork among the Yuchi Indians, receiving his M.A. in 1905\\"Frank Gouldsmith Speck Papers: Biographical Note\\", University of Pennsylvania Archives, accessed 17 Feb 2009 From 1905 to 1908, he continued his work on Yuchi data, receiving his Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania (1908), with his dissertation supervised by Boas. This ethnography focused on the Yuchi people of Oklahoma, among whom he worked in 1904, 1905, and 1908.Jason Baird Jackson. 2004. Introduction. In Ethnology of the Yuchi Indians, v-xvi. Bison Books Edition. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press.Frank G. Speck 1909. Ethnology of the Yuchi Indians. Philadelphia: The University Museum, University of Pennsylvania. ==Career== In 1907, the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) awarded Frank G. Speck a one-year George Lieb Harrison Fellowship as a research fellow at the University Museum (now the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology). Assistant Curator of Archaeology and Ethnology George Byron Gordon arranged for Speck to receive a dual appointment, as both Assistant in Ethnology at the University Museum, and Instructor of Anthropology for the University. Speck was assigned to teach the introductory course in Anthropology. The Harrison Fellowship was next held in 1908 by another of Boas's students, Edward Sapir, a specialist in linguistic anthropology. Speck received a series of re-appointments in his dual position of Assistant in Ethnology/Instructor of Anthropology until 1912, when he was appointed as a full-time faculty member in the new Department of Anthropology. By 1913, after a contentious split with Penn Museum Director Gordon, Speck was appointed as Chair of the Department.University of Pennsylvania to Frank G. Speck 1911-1932, Speck Papers, Subcollection I, Series II, Biographical Material, box 20, American Philosophical Society. Notices of Speck’s appointments can also be found in the University of Pennsylvania Museum Board of Managers Minutes, June 1905-June 1910, and in the Director’s Letterbooks for 1907-1913, Penn Museum Archives. He headed the Department for four decades, stepping down only after his health failed in 1949. Speck was unique among many anthropologists of his generation in choosing to study American Indians close to home, rather than people of more distant lands. The pressures of relocation, boarding schools, cultural assimilation, and economic marginalization had, however, caused many Native American people to lose traditional lands, material, and culture. Speck found that his work constituted, in effect, a \\"salvage operation\\" to try to capture ethnological material during a time of great stress for Indigenous people. He began his efforts among Native Americans in New England, and soon expanded to regions as far afield as Labrador and Ontario in Canada.\\"Frank G. Speck Papers, 1903-1950\\" , American Philosophical Society Website, accessed 16 Feb 2009 Among his students at Penn, Speck nurtured a generation of prominent anthropologists, including: A. Irving Hallowell, Anthony F. C. Wallace, and Loren Eiseley, among many others. Speck also sponsored a few Native American students at Penn: his research assistant Gladys Tantaquidgeon and, for a brief time, Molly Spotted Elk.Bunny McBride. Molly Spotted Elk: Penobscot in Paris (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1995) p. 57-63 In 1924, Speck arranged to enroll Tantaquidgeon in Penn's College Courses for Teachers. Over time, their positions evolved from teacher/student to intellectual colleagues, and he encouraged her to take charge of independent research projects among Delaware, Wampanoag, and Mohegan peoples.Melissa Jayne Fawcett. Medicine Trail: The Life and Lessons of Gladys Tantaquidgeon. University of Arizona Press (2000). Margaret Bruchac has examined the academic relationship between Frank Speck and Gladys Tantaquidgeon in her book called Savage Kin. Speck especially loved fieldwork and typically camped and traveled with the people he studied. During an era of extreme social stratification and white elitism, Speck did not hesitate to invite his Native informants to join him in his field research, to offer lectures in his classroom, and to stay in his home.Kenneth Heuer. Loren C. Eiseley. The Lost Notebooks of Loren Eiseley. Edited and with a reminiscence by Kenneth Heuer. Boston, MA: Little, Brown (1987). Colleagues and students like Ernest Dodge, Carl Weslager, Loren Eisely, and Edmund Carpenter later recalled that Speck was extraordinarily accepting of, and seemed most comfortable among, Indians and other people of color.Carl A. Weslager. \\"The Unforgettable Frank Speck,\\" pp. 52-76 in The Life and Times of Frank G. Speck, 1881-1950, Roy Blankenship, ed. Philadelphia PA: University of Pennsylvania Department of Anthropology (1991). William Fenton recalled that Speck would often absent himself from academic functions when Native American informants came to visit him in Philadelphia.William N. Fenton, \\"Frank G. Speck’s Anthropology,\\" pp. 9-37 in The Life and Times of Frank G. Speck, 1881-1950, Roy Blankenship, ed. Philadelphia PA: University of Pennsylvania Department of Anthropology (1991). During his fieldwork with the Iroquois, Speck became close to members of the Seneca Nation, who marked their relationship by giving him the name Gahehdagowa ('Great Porcupine') when he was adopted into the Turtle clan of the Seneca people. Such adoptions were a means of assigning a kinship position to outsiders who were welcome guests; they did not, however, constitute tribal membership. Speck was particularly interested in how family and kinship systems underlay tribal organizations and relations to homelands and natural resources. In Canada, he developed maps of individual family bands' hunting territories to document Algonquian land rights. These later became crucial to Native American land claims.Frank Speck, \\"The Family Hunting Band as the Basis of Algonquian Social Organization\\", Cultural Ecology', ed. by Bruce Cox (1973); Naskapi (1935, reprint 1977) From the 1920s through the 1940s, Speck also studied the Cherokee in the Southeast United States and Oklahoma. Through the years, he worked extensively with tribal elder Will West Long of Big Cove, western North Carolina. Speck credited Long as co-author of his 1951 book Cherokee Dance and Drama, along with his colleague Leonard Bloom.Cherokee References in Frank G. Speck Papers 1903-1950, Mss. Ms. Collection 126, American Philosophical Society, Philadelphia, PA. Speck was elected to numerous professional associations, where he took an active role on committees, such as the American Association for the Advancement of Science, American Anthropological Association, American Ethnological Society, Geographical Society of Philadelphia, and Archaeological Society of North Carolina (honorary). He conducted work for the American Museum of Natural History in New York, and the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC.Frank G. Speck Papers 1903-1950, Mss.

It does not contain running commentaries on the entire book of Deuteronomy. Rather, it consists of 25 complete, independent homilies (and two fragmentary ones) on 27 sections of Deuteronomy, most of which are recognizable as sedarim (the Sabbatical lessons for public worship according to the Palestinian three-year cycle). The commentary covers only one verse, or a few verses, from each section. == Sections== The index to the Mikraot Gedolot (Venice, 1525) gives 27 sedarim in Deuteronomy. Devarim Rabbah contains homilies on 19 of these, and on a fragment, which, according to the editions, belongs to another seder (Deuteronomy 29:9). There are no homilies on 7 or 8 of the sedarim mentioned in Mikraot Gedolot (Deuteronomy 11:10, 14:1, 15:7, 23:10, 23:22, 24:19, 26:1, and occasionally and conditionally 29:9). One homily in Devarim Rabbah is on a section mentioned in other sources as a seder (Deuteronomy 4:25). Five more homilies appear on sections (Deuteronomy 1:10, 4:7, 11:26, 24:9, and 29:1) which were not otherwise known as sedarim. These variations may be due to differing customs regarding the division of the cycle of sedarim. In some of these homilies, moreover, the halakhic exordiums (see below) close with the words מנין ממה שקרינו בענין ..., which clearly show that the Scriptural sections on which the homilies were pronounced were used for public lessons. Devarim Rabbah probably includes only the homilies on the Sabbatical lessons of the cycle of sedarim, as it contains no homilies on the lessons of the Pesikta cycle belonging to Deuteronomy, Deuteronomy 14:22 and 25:17 (Deuteronomy 33:1 is a seder as well as a Pesikta section). The economy of this Midrash containing sedarim homilies on Deuteronomy, as well as the character of the individual homilies, could easily have been misconstrued and forgotten after the division of the Torah into pericopes according to the one-year cycle had come into general use. In present editions Devarim Rabbah is divided only according to these latter pericopes; it was not noticed that the homilies on Ki Tetze and Ki Tavo did not correspond with the beginnings of the pericopes (Deuteronomy 21:10 and 26:1). The sidrot Nitzavim and Vayelech formed one pericope in the oldest Midrash editions;Constantinople, 1512, and Venice, 1545 hence in these editions Devarim Rabbah contains only ten sections, corresponding with the pericopes. The further designation of these sections as \\"parashiyyot\\" and their enumeration from 1 to 11, dividing Nitzavim and Vayelech, are addenda of the later editions. According to its original composition, this midrash includes the following homilies (the passages marked with an asterisk are sedarim): # 1:1-9 (according to the Vilna edition), on * Deut. 1:1 # 1:10-14, on Deut 1:10 # 1:15-20, on *Deut. 2:2 # 1:21-25, on *Deut. 2:31 # 2:1-9, on *Deut. 3:23 # 2:10-17, on Deut. 4:7 # 2:18-24, on *Deut. 4:25 # 2:25-30, on *Deut. 4:41 # 2:31-37, on *Deut. 6:4 # 3:1-7, on *Deut. 7:12 # 3:8-11, on *Deut. 9:1 # 3:12-17, on *Deut. 10:1 # 4:1-5, on Deut. 11:26 # 4:6-11, on *Deut. 12:20 # 5:1-7, on *Deut. 16:18 # 5:8-11, on *Deut. 17:14 # 5:12-15, on *Deut. 20:10 # 6:1-7, on *Deut. 22:6 # 6:8-14, on Deut. 24:9 # 7:1-7, on *Deut. 28:1 # 7:8-12, on Deut. 29:1 (8:1, merely a halakhic exordium, doubtful if belonging to *Deut.29:9) # 8:2-7, on *Deut. 30:11 # 9:1-9, on *Deut. 31:14 # 10:1-4, on *Deut. 32:1 # 11:1-5, and probably 7–8, on Deut. 33:1 (11:6 is an interpolated second halakhic exordium; 11:8 probably closes the homily and the Midrash, the remaining pieces being additions borrowed from the Midrash on the death of Moses). ==Structure of each section== Each homily has a set structure: it begins with a halakhic exordium, has one or more proems, followed by the commentary (covering only the first verse, or a few verses from the beginning of the section read), and ends with an easily recognizable peroration containing a promise of the Messianic future or some other consolatory thought, followed by a verse of the Bible. The comments referring only to the first verses of the lesson characterize Devarim Rabbah as a Midrash of homilies, in which even the proems are independent homilies rather than introductions to the comment on the Scriptural section. The exordiums show that Devarim Rabbah is very similar to the Tanḥuma Midrashim. In the halakhic exordium (an essential of the aggadic discourse which is found neither in Pesikta Rabbati and Vayikra Rabbah nor in Bereshit Rabbah), an apparently irrelevant legal question is put, and answered with a passage from the Mishnah (about twenty times) or Tosefta, etc. Such answers are generally introduced in Devarim Rabbah by the formula כך שנו חכמים, though the formula commonly used in the Tanhuma (כך שנו רבותינו) occurs twice (in 1:10,15). Then follow other halakhic explanations (compare 5:8; 7:1; 7:8; 9:1; 11:1) and aggadic interpretations, the last of which are deduced from the Scriptural section of the Sabbath lesson. Thus, a connection between the halakhic question and the text or the first verse of the lesson is found, and the speaker can proceed to the further discussion of the homily, the exordiums closing generally with the formula מנין ממה שקרינו בענין, followed by the first words of the Scriptural section. The formula occurs 18 times as cited; twice as מנין שכתוב בענין; once as מנין שכך כתוב; twice as מנין שנאמר; it is lacking altogether in only a few of the homilies. === Resemblance to Yelamdenu === The stylistic manner of opening the discourse with a halakhic question is so closely connected with the original Midrash Tanḥuma, however, that in consequence of the introductory formula ילמדנו רבינו (\\"May our teacher instruct us?\\"), with which the exordiums and hence the homilies began, the name \\"Yelamdenu\\" was also given to this Midrash. Even in early times some scholars concluded from the halakhic exordiums in Devarim Rabbah that this Midrash was derived in large part from the Yelamdenu; as did Abraham ben Solomon Akra.In his Kelale Midrash Rabbah, Venice, 1601 == Comparison to other midrashim == Curiously, while in Devarim Rabbah every homily has a halakhic exordium, in the extant Tanhuma the part on Deuteronomy is without any exordium (the Tanhuma edited by S. Buber lacks the exordiums to Exodus also). However, it would be erroneous to conclude from this that the present Devarim Rabbah must be identified with Tanhuma, and Tanhuma to Deuteronomy with Devarim Rabbah. It would also be erroneous to conclude that Devarim Rabbah, the Tanhuma on Deuteronomy, and several other Midrashim to Deuteronomy of which fragments have been published in modern times (or from which quotations are found in old authors), have all borrowed from the original Yelamdenu. If the designation \\"Tanḥuma homilies\\" be given to the homilies with this structure (consisting of halakhic introductions, proems, comments on various verses, etc.), modeled on the form of the Yelamdenu Tanhuma, and if Yelamdenu was also the model for the aggadic discourses in the centuries immediately following Tanḥuma, it may be said that Devarim Rabbah contains these homilies in a much more primitive form and also in a more complete collection than does Tanhuma to Deuteronomy in Buber's and the earlier editions; for these editions are extant in a very defective form, treat many fewer sedarim than Devarim Rabbah, and are (with few exceptions) only shorter or longer fragments of sedarim homilies.As Theodor has shown in his Die Midraschim zum Pentateuch, in Monatsschrift, 1886, pp. 559 et seq. Given that the structure of the homilies and the composition of the whole work, lend to Devarim Rabbah the appearance of a Tanhuma Midrash, it is not strange that passages from Tanhuma are quoted, in some citations of earlier authors (in the 13th century and later), as belonging to Tanḥuma. Textually, Devarim Rabbah has little in common with the Tanḥuma Midrashim on Deuteronomy, either in the editions or in the extracts from Tanḥuma in Yalkut Shimoni or from Yelamdenu in Yalkut Shimoni and Arukh. Some halakhic questions found also in Tanḥuma in homilies on Genesis, Exodus, and Leviticus are quite differently applied and developed in the exordiums of Devarim Rabbah. This Midrash, in its use of the old sources (such as Yerushalmi, Bereshit Rabbah, and Vayikra Rabbah) often shows a freer treatment, and endeavors to translate Aramaic passages into Hebrew and to modernize them. == Probable date == As regards the time of writing or editing the Devarim Rabbah, \\"the epoch of the year 900\\" comes, according to Zunz, \\"perhaps\\" nearest the mark. The Midrash was not known either to Nathan ben Jehiel, the author of the Arukh, or to Rashi (the passage in a citation quoted by the latter is not found in Devarim Rabbah). A large number of extracts are found in Yalkut Shimoni, generally with the designation of the Midrash אלה הדברים רבה, as it is commonly cited by the older authors. == Manuscripts similar to the modern Devarim Rabbah == The name Devarim Rabbah is given to the Midrash on Deuteronomy in Codex Munich, No. 229. This contains for the first pericope (Devarim) four entirely different homilies, which have only a few points of similarity to the modern Devarim Rabbah, but which are likewise composed according to the Tanhuma form, and are on the same Scriptural sections as the homilies in Devarim Rabbah (on Deuteronomy 1:1, 1:10, 2:2, 2:31). The second and third pericopes have also halakhic exordiums closing with the words, מנין ממה שקרינו בענין..., in which, however, the question is put without any formula. The Munich manuscript agrees with Devarim Rabbah in the pericopes Ekev to Nitzavim, but has additions to the latter; the remaining pericopes are lacking. Another manuscript Midrash, which was in the possession of A. Epstein circa 1900, contains not only the same homilies as Codex Munich for the pericope Devarim, but also has similar homilies for the pericope Va'etchanan, which are entirely different from Devarim Rabbah and are on the sedarim Deuteronomy 3:23 (not 4:7), 4:25, 4:41, 6:4; all these four homilies have halakhic exordiums. The manuscript also has a different exordium for the beginning of Ekev. From this point to the pericope Ki Tavo, it agrees with the print editions (the exordiums, however, are preceded only by the word הלכה, without אדם מישראל); in pericope Nitvavim and its additions it agrees with the Codex Munich. For Vayelech (also on Deuteronomy 31:14) it has a different text; and in the last two pericopes (Haazinu and Vezot Habracha) it agrees with Midrash Tanhuma in present editions. It may be assumed with certainty that the first one or two pericopes of this manuscript (in which several passages can be pointed out that R. Baḥya (end of the 13th century) quotes from the Midrash Rabbah or from אלה הדברים רבה) belong to a Midrash that originally included the whole of Deuteronomy. What remained of that Midrash was combined in those codices with pericopes from Devarim Rabbah and Midrash Tanḥuma. Among the numerous Midrashim to Deuteronomy there are known to be a number of fragments of a Devarim Zuta, the preservation of which is due to the author of Yalkut Shimoni. ==References Jewish Encyclopedia bibliography === * See Bibliography to Bereshit Rabbah.

They are also called ancient Camuni, to distinguish them from the current inhabitants of the valley (the Camuni or Camunians). The Camunni were among the greatest producers of rock art in Europe; their name is linked to the famous rock engravings of Valcamonica. A people of obscure origin, they lived in a region, the Val Camonica, that had already been the site of a cultural tradition dating back to the early Neolithic. The Camunni are mentioned by classical historiographical sources from the 1st century BC, corresponding to the Iron Age in Val Camonica (from the 12th century BC until about Romanization). In ancient Greek, Strabo referred to them as (Kamounoi), while Cassius Dio called them (Kamounnioi). Conquered by Rome at the beginning of the 1st century AD, the Camunni were gradually incorporated into the political and social structures of the Roman Empire as a self-governing polity called the Res Publica Camunnorum. They were granted Roman citizenship from the second half of the 1st century, with a rapid process of Latinization. ==History== Peoples of Cisalpine Gaul 391-192 BC. ===The Camunni in classical sources=== The Greek historian Strabo (63/64 BC–ca. 24 AD) described the Camunni as part of the Rhaetian peoples and related to the Celtic Lepontii:LinguistList: LeponticJohn T. Koch (ed.) Celtic culture: a historical encyclopedia ABC-CLIO (2005) The Roman historian Pliny the Elder (23–79 AD), citing the Origines of Cato the Elder (234–149 BC), spoke instead of the Camunni as one of several tribes of the Euganei: rock carving of Cernunnos in the National park of Naquane (Capo di Ponte)Umberto Sansoni-Silvana Gavaldo, L'arte rupestre del Pià d'Ort: la vicenda di un santuario preistorico alpino, p. 156; . ===Contacts with the Etruscans and Celts=== The Etruscans, already widespread in the Po Valley, had contacts with Alpine populations by the 5th century BC. Surviving traces of Etruscan cultural influence are recorded in the aforementioned rock art in over two hundred texts written in the Camunic alphabet, which is a variant of the North Etruscan alphabet.. At the beginning of the 7th century BC, the Celtic Gauls arrived in Italy. Coming from Transalpine Gaul, they settled in the Po plain and came in touch with the Camunian population. Some of the petroglyphs in Valcamonica with figures of Celtic deities such as Kernunnos attest this Gaulish presence. ===The Roman conquest=== Northern Italy according to William R. Shepherd's Historical Atlas; the Camunni are at the western end of Venetia Val Camonica was subjected to Rome during the campaigns of Augustus to conquer Raetia and the Alpine arc, conducted by his generals Nero Claudius Drusus and Tiberius (the future emperor) against the mountain peoples in 16–15 BC. Publius Silius Nerva, governor of Illyricum, was to complete the conquest of the eastern Alpine front, which reached from the valley of Como to Lake Garda (therefore including the Valcamonica), in addition to the Vennoneti of Vinschgau. The Roman conquest is also mentioned by the Roman historian Cassius Dio writing in Greek: The Camunni and Vennoni, Alpine tribes, took up arms against the Romans, but were conquered and subdued by Publius Silius. This conquest was celebrated in the Trophy of the Alps (Tropaeum Alpium), a Roman monument erected in 7–6 BC and located in the French town of La Turbie, whose frontal inscription named the conquered Alpine peoples: Inscription of the Roman period found in Cividate Camuno, containing the terms: QUIR(ina), CAMUNNIS and RE P(ublica) CAMUNNOR(um) After the Roman conquest, the Camunni were annexed to the nearest cities in a condition of semi-subjection through the practice of adtributio, which allowed them to maintain their own tribal constitution while the dominant city became the administrative, judicial, and fiscal center. The city that the Camunni were assigned to was probably Brixia. At first they were assigned the status of peregrinus, and then they obtained Roman citizenship; in the Flavian Age they were assigned to the Quirina tribe, while they maintained a certain self-government; in fact, a Res Publica Camunnorum has been recorded. Romanization proceeded from Civitas Camunnorum (Cividate Camuno), a city founded by the Romans around 23 BC, during the principate of Tiberius. Beginning in the 1st century, the Camunni were included in stable Roman political and social structures, as evidenced by the numerous legionaries, artisans, and even gladiators of Camunian origins in several areas of the Roman Empire. Camunian religion went through the process of interpretatio Romana, forming a syncretic combination with Roman religion. ==Religion== Camunian stone carvings, 70–80% of which date to the Bronze Age, are thought to have held value for celebratory, commemorative, initiatory, and propitiatory rituals. The Sanctuary of Minerva, found at Spinera between Cividate Camuno and Breno in 1986, dates to the Roman period and was finely decorated with mosaics. The beginning of the Middle Ages coincided with the arrival of the Christian religion among the Camunni. The 4th and 5th centuries witnessed the destruction of the ancient places of worship, with the destruction of statue menhirs in Ossimo and Cemmo and the burning of the Sanctuary of Minerva. ==Language== Surviving traces of the language spoken by the Camunni are scarce and undeciphered. Among the Rock Drawings in Valcamonica there are some inscriptions written in the Camunic language, written in a northern variant of the Etruscan alphabet. There is insufficient knowledge about Camunic to be able to determine whether it belongs to a broader language family. ==References== * ==BibliographyPrimary sources=== * Cassius Dio, Roman History * Pliny the Elder, Naturalis Historia * Strabo, Geographica * Trophy of the Alps ===Historiographical literature === * Raffaele De Marinis, Le popolazioni alpine di stirpe retica in G.

Here they communicate with the anterior division of lateral cutaneous nerve, the anterior division of medial cutaneous nerve and the infrapatellar branch of the saphenous, to form the patellar plexus. In the upper part of the thigh the lateral branch of the intermediate cutaneous communicates with the lumboinguinal branch of the genitofemoral nerve. ==Medial cutaneous nerve of thigh== The medial cutaneous nerve (internal cutaneous nerve) passes obliquely across the upper part of the sheath of the femoral artery, and divides in front, or at the medial side of that vessel, into two branches, an anterior and a posterior. The anterior branch runs downward on the sartorius, perforates the fascia lata at the lower third of the thigh, and divides into two branches: one supplies the integument as low down as the medial side of the knee; the other crosses to the lateral side of the patella, communicating in its course with the infrapatellar branch of the saphenous nerve. The posterior branch descends along the medial border of the sartorius to the knee, where it pierces the fascia lata, communicates with the saphenous nerve, and gives off several cutaneous branches. It then passes down to supply the integument of the medial side of the leg. Beneath the fascia lata, at the lower border of the adductor longus, it joins to form a plexiform net-work (subsartorial plexus) with branches of the saphenous and obturator nerves. When the communicating branch from the obturator nerve is large and continued to the integument of the leg, the posterior branch of the medial cutaneous is small, and terminates in the plexus, occasionally giving off a few cutaneous filaments. The medial cutaneous nerve, before dividing, gives off a few filaments, which pierce the fascia lata, to supply the integument of the medial side of the thigh, accompanying the long saphenous vein. One of these filaments passes through the saphenous opening; a second becomes subcutaneous about the middle of the thigh; a third pierces the fascia at its lower third. ==Additional images== Image:Gray580.pngThe great saphenous vein and its tributaries at the fossa ovalis.

Clay Davis is a corrupt State Senator who is an important Democratic fundraiser. Baltimore mayors therefore try to stay on his good side. ===Damien Lavelle Price=== * Played by: Donnell Rawlings * Appears in: :Season one: \\"One Arrest\\" and \\"Lessons\\". :Season five: \\"Not for Attribution\\" and \\"Took\\". Damien Lavelle Price (also known as \\"Day Day\\") is an aide to Senator Clay Davis. He is a convicted felon who appears unrefined on several occasions, casually contemplating a home burglary at a public gathering (and in the presence of Cedric Daniels), and stating things such as, \\"Y'all tryin' to 'criminate me\\" while on the witness stand in court. He acts as a bag man in collecting cash from drug organizations. Price is arrested with a bag of cash after making a pick-up from the Barksdale Organization in season 1 but is released without charge when Davis pressures Deputy Commissioner Ervin Burrell. Price reappears in Season 5 testifying as part of the case against Davis. ===Odell Watkins=== * Played by: Frederick Strother * Appears in: :Season three: \\"Time After Time\\"; \\"Dead Soldiers\\"; \\"Homecoming\\"; \\"Slapstick\\"; \\"Middle Ground\\" and \\"Mission Accomplished\\". :Season four: \\"Soft Eyes\\"; \\"Home Rooms\\"; \\"Refugees\\"; \\"Alliances\\"; \\"Margin of Error\\"; \\"Unto Others\\"; \\"Final Grades\\". :Season five: \\"Unconfirmed Reports\\", \\"Transitions\\" State Delegate Odell Watkins is a longtime major Baltimore political figure and a wheelchair user. Watkins is a member of the influential State Appropriations Committee with strong voter influence and is known as a kingmaker. Watkins is also the moral voice of authority within Baltimore politicians as he has full support of the religious leaders, looks to address the concerns of the citizens in an ethical and representable way, and is most critical of politicians prone to bribes and corruption. In season three, Watkins backs Marla Daniels' campaign for the Western district council seat. Watkins believes that the council woman Marla aims to unseat, Eunetta Perkins, has become uninterested in the job. Initially, Mayor Royce resists, as Perkins was loyal to him. However, when he needs Watkins' support after a controversy involving Major Colvin legalizing drugs, Royce agrees to support Daniels. Watkins is disappointed, feeling that Royce should have decisively fired Police Commissioner Ervin Burrell over the scandal. Royce claims that firing Burrell though would only fuel fire aimed towards city hall given the reasoning for the \\"Hamsterdam\\" fallout. Watkins also connects Daniels with Dennis Wise, helping the former criminal to open a boxing gym for local children in her district. Watkins becomes further disillusioned after working with Royce's political rival Tommy Carcetti to secure funds for witness protection, and asking the mayor to match the funds. The mayor ignores their proposal, and Carcetti uses this against Royce in a debate after another witness is killed in the fourth season. Watkins, Carcetti, and Marla Daniels all attend the funeral of the murdered witness. Watkins splits from Royce once and for all after he notices that Royce's campaign staff only has Daniels on his ticket in districts where she is strong, and has her opponent Eunetta Perkins in the same position in districts where Daniels is weaker. He is also angered by Royce's immorality in supporting corrupt developers and politicians (such as Clay Davis). Furthermore, Watkins claims that as Royce has \\"gotten into bed with every developer,\\" he has forgotten his roots by not helping the city's African American community and is covering it up by using Marcus Garvey posters in his campaign. Watkins angrily confronts Royce about his failure to keep his word and tells him he will no longer support his campaign, and instead sits out of the primary. Carcetti learns of Royce's failure to keep Watkins' trust through the police security detailed to protect the mayor as Deputy Rawls is looking to help the mayoral candidate who will do the right things with the PD. Carcetti appeals to Watkins to support him and become a guiding voice in his administration. Watkins' support on the campaign trail swings the tight primary to Carcetti's favor, and he easily goes on to become Mayor. Watkins' first piece of advice to Carcetti is that he would be unable to fire Burrell because of his race and Baltimore's African American majority of voters. Watkins at the same time agrees with the others in the administration that an out of town African American police commissioner should be sought as he has no confidence in Burrell either. ==Baltimore City AdministrationCurrent=== Nerese Campbell * Played by: Marlyne Afflack * Appears in: :Season four: \\"Boys of Summer\\"; \\"Margin of Error\\"; \\"Know Your Place\\"; \\"Misgivings\\"; and \\"That's Got His Own\\" :Season five: \\"More With Less\\"; \\"Unconfirmed Reports\\"; \\"Transitions\\"; \\"React Quotes\\"; \\"Clarifications\\"; \\"Late Editions\\"; and \\"–30–\\". Nerese Campbell is the Democratic president of the Baltimore City council. She is the only member of Clarence Royce's campaign ticket to have won election to their respective position. Campbell voices opposition to Tommy Carcetti's plan to fire Commissioner Ervin Burrell claiming that a good portion of her constituency would be against this action. She is close to the ministers and politicians from Clarence Royce's era and frequently uses that influence as leverage against Carcetti. She tells Carcetti that a gentleman's agreement had been in place whereby she would become the next mayor at the end of Royce's tenure. Carcetti replies that she may become mayor by default should he decide to run for governor in two years time. When issues pertaining to the city school system arise, Campbell suggests that Carcetti go to Maryland's Republican governor to beg for money to solve the district's $54 million deficit. In the fifth season, Campbell is seen to influence and intimidate several key figures in politics and the police department. When Clay Davis threatens to incriminate other politicians of the Royce administration when he feels ill-supported during his trial, it is Campbell who convinces him that it is more advantageous for him to go quietly. Otherwise, he would return from prison and have \\"nowhere to hang his hat\\" in Baltimore. She advises him to follow ex-Commissioner Burrell's example, who has been promoted to a more lucrative job after leaving quietly when Mayor Carcetti fired him over falsified crime statistics. Burrell had threatened Campbell to leak an FBI file about Cedric Daniels, Carcetti's candidate for new Commissioner, if the mayor fired him. Campbell retains the file and threatens Daniels in the last episode of season 5 to reveal it, if he doesn't comply with the mayor's orders to falsify the crime statistics. In the final montage of the series finale, it is revealed that Campbell becomes the Mayor of Baltimore after Tommy Carcetti leaves to become the Governor of Maryland. Campbell bears similarities to former Baltimore mayor Sheila Dixon, who was the city council president and became mayor following Martin O'Malley's 2006 election as governor. Tommy Carcetti Tommy Carcetti is the new Mayor of Baltimore. Marla Daniels * Played by: Maria Broom * Appears in: :Season 1: \\"The Detail\\"; \\"One Arrest\\"; \\"Lessons\\" and \\"Sentencing\\". :Season 2: \\"Collateral Damage\\"; \\"Backwash\\" and \\"Port in a Storm\\". :Season 3: \\"Time After Time\\"; \\"Hamsterdam\\"; \\"Homecoming\\"; \\"Slapstick\\" and \\"Mission Accomplished\\". :Season 4: \\"Home Rooms\\", \\"Refugees\\" :Season 5: \\"Not for Attribution\\", and \\"–30–\\". Marla is the ex-wife of Colonel Cedric Daniels'. She always had ambitions for her husband to progress in the police force, and his failure to do so contributed to the demise of their relationship. As their marriage fell apart, she decided to run for City Council and was elected Councilwoman from the 11th District of Baltimore. Cedric seems a likely candidate to receive a promotion when he is assigned to run the controversial Barksdale detail. Throughout the first season, Marla advised Cedric to build the case his superiors were demanding (quick and simple, with low-level busts), but he is pushed to more elaborate investigative work by the detectives he commanded. He also meets Day Day Price while attending a function Marla drags him to, which turns out to be important for the investigation. Cedric is banished to evidence control after upsetting his superiors, and Marla convinces him to leave the department and become a lawyer. Cedric is ready to do so until he receives a second chance to do the kind of investigative work he wants in the new Sobotka detail. Marla greets his decision to stay with the BPD with worry and skepticism, and eventually the couple separates. Marla runs for City Council in season 3; Cedric appears publicly in uniform as a content husband to support her. Marla had the support and guidance of State Delegate Odell Watkins, but ran against Eunetta Perkins, an old ally of Mayor Clarence Royce's. Because of this, Royce holds up Cedric's promotion to major. Marla eventually seeks a reconciliation with Cedric, but he declines as he has become involved with Rhonda Pearlman. As a way of appeasing Watkins, the mayor eventually lends Marla his support and authorizes Cedric's promotion. Even with the mayor's support, Marla has trouble overcoming her entrenched rival at the beginning of season 4. Marla, alongside Watkins, attends the funeral of a witness murdered in the district and learns that Tommy Carcetti is supportive of her campaign, despite her being part of Royce's ticket. Watkins switches to Carcetti's ticket at the last minute, and Marla comes with him and wins the election.  Jerilee 'Gerry' Bennett  * Played by: Karen Vicks * Appears in season four: \\"Boys of Summer\\" (uncredited); \\"Soft Eyes\\" (uncredited); \\"Refugees\\"; \\"Margin of Error\\"; \\"Unto Others\\"; . Jerilee Bennett was a key member of Tommy Carcetti’s campaign staff in the Mayoral election race. She helps to decide campaign strategy along with Norman Wilson and Theresa D'Agostino. She becomes a senior staffer in the Carcetti administration. Anthony Gray * Played by: Christopher Mann * Appears in: :Season three: \\"Time After Time\\"; \\"Dead Soldiers\\"; \\"Hamsterdam\\"; \\"Straight and True\\"; \\"Homecoming\\"; \\"Moral Midgetry\\"; \\"Slapstick\\" and \\"Mission Accomplished\\". :Season four: \\"Boys of Summer\\", \\"Soft Eyes\\"; \\"Alliances\\"; \\"Margin of Error\\". \\"Tony\\" Gray first appeared as a Democratic Baltimore Councilman in season three, working alongside his good friend Tommy Carcetti on the public safety subcommittee. Gray becomes disillusioned with Mayor Royce and uses his position on the committee to berate senior police officials including acting commissioner Burrell. Gray decides to run for mayor on an education platform; Carcetti encourages the decision, manipulating him to run. Gray hopes that Carcetti would join his campaign with a position as council president as a reward, but Carcetti plans to run for mayor himself, and is hoping Gray will split the black voting majority and allow him to win. This deception upsets Gray and destroys their friendship. In season four, Gray continues his stalling campaign. Carcetti's deputy campaign manager Norman Wilson feeds Gray a story about the police department covering up the murder of a state's witness. Wilson rationalizes that Gray cannot win the election and has to choose between losing with 24% of the vote or with 28%, the latter of which would do far more good to Gray's career and political credibility as well as help Carcetti win the election by taking valuable votes away from Royce. Gray acquiesces, and his public criticism of Royce is integral to Carcetti's eventual victory in the mayoral race. Gray's last appearances in the show are attending church with his wife on the eve of the election, and voting in the election itself. Michael Steintorf * Played by: Neal Huff * Appears in :Season four: \\"That's Got His Own\\" and \\"Final Grades\\". :Season five: \\"More With Less\\"; \\"Unconfirmed Reports\\"; \\"Not for Attribution\\"; \\"Transitions\\"; \\"The Dickensian Aspect\\"; \\"Took\\"; \\"Clarifications\\"; \\"Late Editions\\"; and \\"–30–\\". Michael Steintorf becomes Mayor Tommy Carcetti's chief of staff. Steintorf counsels Carcetti to reject the Governor's plan to force them to expend the political capital they need for Carcetti to later run for governor in exchange for the capital they need to rectify the deficit in the education budget. Steintorf continues to push Carcetti towards his run for Governor and their decision to decline the Governor's funding leaves the city with a difficult budget crisis. Steintorf is concerned that Carcetti needs to pick a suitable successor so that people feel comfortable with him leaving Baltimore for the Governor's chair. Steintorf thinks that Nerese Campbell's links to corruption make her unsuitable and suggests that State's Attorney Rupert Bond might be a preferable alternative. Carcetti and Steintorf's focus on running for Governor brings criticism from Norman Wilson and State Delegate Odell Watkins but Steintorf believes Carcetti's ambitions are typical of the world as a whole. Steintorf is pleased when Carcetti is able to fire Commissioner Ervin Burrell and supports the plan to replace him with Cedric Daniels in time. Carcetti and Steintorf reject State Senator Clay Davis' offer to smooth over the transitions in the police department in exchange for assistance in his corruption case. Steintorf is petulant when Campbell and the politically influential ministers use the situation in the police department to negotiate for political favors but Carcetti grants their demands. Following the breaking of the homeless serial killer story Steintorf is instrumental in developing homelessness into a key issue for Carcetti's gubernatorial campaign. Steintorf is also involved in dealing with the budget ramifications of shifting resources back to the police department. Steintorf is responsible for pressuring the police department to provide a drop in crime to protect Carcetti from criticism and refuses to honor Carcetti's earlier promises to reform the police department. Once the serial killer is revealed to be fake Steintorf negotiates with William Rawls, Daniels, Bond, and Rhonda Pearlman to ensure that a thorough cover-up is put into effect. Rawls and Pearlman are rewarded for their co-operation with new posts. After the crisis is dealt with Steintorf renews pressure on Daniels to produce a drop in crime and order him to falsify statistics. When Daniels refuses Steintorf approaches Campbell and convinces her that Daniels will remain problematic when she replaces Carcetti as Mayor. Campbell intervenes and forces Daniels to step down and Steintorf receives his required statistics from his replacement, Stanislaus Valchek. At the close of the series Steintorf's machinations ensure that Carcetti becomes Governor. Norman Wilson Wilson is a former journalist, professional Democratic political operative and deputy manager of Tommy Carcetti's campaign in the mayoral race. He becomes Carcetti's deputy chief of staff after he is elected. ===Former=== Eunetta Perkins * Played by: Unknown * Appears in: :Season three: \\"Mission Accomplished\\" :Season four: \\"Refugees\\"; \\"Alliances\\" Eunetta was the City Councilwoman from the 11th District of Baltimore. According to a commentary track, it was a running joke on the show that Perkins was never present at City Council meetings. Despite this, Mayor Royce sticks with her, due to her loyalty. Eventually, Royce agrees to support her opponent, Marla Daniels. Royce is seen supporting both candidates causing Odell Watkins to throw his support to Tommy Carcetti taking Daniels with him. Perkins remains on the ticket keeping the race tight, but ultimately loses the position to Marla Daniels. Coleman Parker * Played by: Cleo Reginald Pizana * Appears in: :Season three: \\"Time After Time\\"; \\"Dead Soldiers\\"; \\"Straight and True\\"; \\"Homecoming\\"; \\"Back Burners\\"; \\"Reformation\\"; \\"Middle Ground\\" and \\"Mission Accomplished\\". :Season four: \\"Boys of Summer\\"; \\"Soft Eyes\\"; \\"Home Rooms\\"; \\"Refugees\\"; \\"Alliances\\"; \\"Unto Others\\" and \\"Final Grades\\". Parker was the chief of staff and main advisor to Mayor Clarence Royce, organizing Royce's time and limiting access to the mayor. Parker relies on property developer Andy Krawczyk for large donations and assistance in fund raising. He organizes the mayor's re-election campaign including public speaking events with major property developers. He is also responsible for negotiations over debates with the mayor. In season three, Parker is the first to see that Royce is politically vulnerable because of Baltimore's rising crime rate and urges the mayor to fire acting Police Commissioner Ervin Burrell. Royce resists, because he values loyalty and Burrell has always proved useful to him. When drug tolerant zones set up by police district commander Howard \\"Bunny\\" Colvin are exposed in Western Baltimore, Parker advisers that it would be a disaster to support them, despite a fall in the areas' crime rate. Royce entertains the idea of extending the experiment, but Parker eventually convinces him that this would be too difficult to explain to the public. Parker again calls for Burrell to be fired and Royce agrees. However, Burrell convinces Royce that he will deflect responsibility off of Royce, and expects to receive a full term as commissioner as a reward for his loyalty. Parker and Royce privately agree to fire Burrell once they win re- election. Parker first appears quick to crack down on Burrell and Demper when key political figures are served with subpoenas for their records by the Baltimore police department in season four. He and Royce extracts an assurance from Burrell that there will be no further surprises from the department. In Royce's first debate, opponent Tommy Carcetti scores points against him using knowledge of the recent murder of a state's witness. The Mayor orders Parker to institute a series of measures to strike back against Carcetti, including disrupting Carcetti's campaign and bullying contributors into solely contributing to the Royce war chest, but Carcetti continues to gain on the Mayor in the polls. When Burrell reassigns the lead detective on the witness case this gives Carcetti, Royce's other opponent Anthony Gray uses this against him. Parker urges Royce to fire Burrell and this time he agrees. Parker is dismayed when Royce alienates State Delegate Watkins, a key supporter with influence among religious leaders, by failing to support Watkins' protegee Marla Daniels. Parker desperately pursues Watkins to urge him to reconsider. This proves to be a turning point in the election race, and Royce is defeated by Carcetti. Royce and Parker later meet with Carcetti and his chief of staff Norman Wilson to amiably discuss the transfer of power. Parker is last seen discussing future prospects with Wilson, planning to either lead another campaign for Royce in a different office or, barring that, a \\"new buck\\". Clarence Royce Royce was the mayor of Baltimore, but Carcetti beat him in a primary upset. ==Campaign staffTheresa D'Agostino=== * Played by: Brandy Burre * Appears in: :Season three: \\"Hamsterdam\\"; \\"Straight and True\\"; \\"Homecoming\\"; \\"Back Burners\\"; \\"Moral Midgetry\\"; \\"Slapstick\\"; \\"Reformation\\"; \\"Middle Ground\\" and \\"Mission Accomplished\\". :Season four: \\"Boys of Summer\\"; \\"Soft Eyes\\"; \\"Home Rooms\\"; \\"Refugees\\"; \\"Alliances\\"; \\"Margin of Error\\" Terry D'Agostino is a Washington- based political consultant and campaign fixer. She grew up in Baltimore and graduated from the University of Maryland School of Law at the same time as councilman Tommy Carcetti. In season three, Carcetti aggressively pursues D'Agostino to work as his campaign manager for his planned run for Mayor. She is reluctant to work for a white candidate in a predominantly African American city, but Carcetti convinces her he is worth taking a chance on. Once on board, D'Agostino is quick to plan a strategy for the campaign. Carcetti suggests they use his colleague Tony Gray, who was also planning to run, to split the African American voter base. At the same time, D'Agostino meets Jimmy McNulty at a school open house for his sons and they quickly become involved in a strictly sexual relationship. The relationship quickly sours after McNulty reveals his lack of culture and education, his lack of a college degree and, even worse, his indifference about politics over a rare dinner date. It then ends abruptly after D'Agostino meets him under the pretense of wanting to start back up again. McNulty ditches her when he realizes that she is pressing him for information about Bunny Colvin and Hamsterdam to help with Carcetti's campaign. D'Agostino arranges for Carcetti to receive coaching on his public speaking. She felt that he is too focused on winning arguments and that he should put appearing likable first. When Carcetti discovers Colvin's Hamsterdam project, D'Agostino sees an opportunity to attack Royce, and encourages her candidate to use it. He uses this to launch into an inspiring speech, convincing many that he is a political force to be reckoned with. In season four, the campaign is in full swing, and D'Agostino works alongside new deputy campaign manager Norman Wilson. She encourages Carcetti to become involved in fundraising, forcing him to stay in his office until he has raised set amounts. She also shields him as best she could from polling data that did not meet his expectations. D'Agostino's strategizing and Wilson's hard work on the campaign trail contribute to Carcetti's victory in the mayoral primary. D'Agostino chooses the night of his win to approach him for her \\"win bonus\\" by seducing him. When Carcetti resists her advances she is bemused but respects his wishes. D'Agostino returns to Washington with a higher profile to work for the DCCC after her success in Baltimore. ==Fund-raisersAndy Krawczyk=== * Played by: Michael Willis * Appears in: :Season two: \\"Collateral Damage\\" (uncredited) and \\"Port in a Storm\\" (uncredited). :Season three: \\"Hamsterdam\\"; \\"Straight and True\\"; \\"Homecoming\\"; \\"Moral Midgetry\\"; \\"Middle Ground\\" and \\"Mission Accomplished\\". :Season four: \\"Soft Eyes\\"; \\"Refugees\\"; \\"A New Day\\"; \\"That's Got His Own\\". :Season five: \\"The Dickensian Aspect\\"; and \\"–30–\\". Krawczyk is a property developer who is at least marginally corrupt. He discusses Frank Sobotka's union business with Major Valchek. He is working on a model of the prospective grain pier condominium development which Sobotka is against. He is later shown breaking ground on the development with State Senator Davis. In season three, Krawczyk is revealed to be the property developing consultant to Stringer Bell. He is constantly trying to calm Stringer down, explaining the business to him, and is ultimately present when Omar Little comes calling on Bell for revenge. In season four, he continues to make campaign donations to Clarence Royce in exchange for assistance with his property developments. Krawczyk is also a regular fixture at Royce's fundraising poker games, where players deliberately lose (to get around campaign finance laws). Detective Kima Greggs personally serves Krawczyk, who does not seem particularly worried by this, with a subpoena for financial records, as part of Lester Freamon's investigation into the Barksdale money trail. He is shown in seasons four and five in scenes showing his political influence and trying to get \\"in\\" the new administration. In one of the mayor's meetings he is also revealed to be president of the school board, and takes no responsibility for the system's debt. There is some suggestive dialogue in the scene that hints he may be involved in the defrauding of the school budget. Michael Willis was previously a recurring character on David Simon's previous show, Homicide: Life on the Street, playing a corrupt deceitful lawyer. ==RelativesJen Carcetti=== * Played by: Megan Anderson * Appears in: :Season three: \\"Dead Soldiers\\"; \\"Homecoming\\"; \\"Back Burners\\"; \\"Moral Midgetry\\"; \\"Reformation\\" and \\"Mission Accomplished\\". :Season four: \\"Boys of Summer\\"; \\"Soft Eyes\\"; \\"Margin of Error\\"; Final Grades. :Season five: \\"The Dickensian Aspect\\" (uncredited); \\"Clarifications\\"; and \\"–30–\\". Jen Carcetti is the wife of councilman Tommy Carcetti. They have two children, a son and a daughter. Jen supports Tommy's political ambitions and is seemingly unaware of his infidelity. ==References== ","title":"Politicians of The Wire"},{"id":"9076067","text":"\\"Lord of the Thighs\\" is a song performed by American rock band Aerosmith. It was written by frontman Steven Tyler, and released on the band's 1974 album Get Your Wings. Drummer Joey Kramer has said it is his favorite song to perform live. Kramer and singer Steven Tyler have each said that he alone was the subject of the song's title. The song has remained a live staple since its release. ==Composition== \\"Thighs\\", as it is commonly abbreviated on setlists and elsewhere, was supposedly the last song written for Get Your Wings. The band needed one additional song for the album, so they locked themselves in Studio C at the Record Plant in New York City and came up with this song, based on the unsavory characters near their hotel on Eighth Avenue. The tongue-in-cheek lyrics are filled with double entendres and innuendo, and the song is darker than it first appears. The song is notable for the funky drum beat by Kramer. In its opening, the drum beat sounds very similar to \\"Walk This Way\\" and the song also features lead guitar work by Brad Whitford and piano playing by Steven Tyler. ==Live performances== The song has long been a staple in setlists at Aerosmith concerts, and was featured on the live albums Live! Bootleg and Classics Live I. It was also featured on the deep cut collection Gems. The song was resurrected as a live staple, being played at several concerts on the Rockin' the Joint and Route of All Evil Tours in 2005 and 2006. In concert, the band typically does an extended jam in the song, which often results in the song exceeding seven minutes in length, which prominently features Whitford on lead guitar. Tyler also introduces Whitford before he starts playing the song's riff. Joe Perry typically plays slide guitar. ==Notable cover version== * The Breeders covered the song in 1993 as a b-side to Cannonball. * Danzig covered the song on their 2015 album Skeletons. ==In other media== The song was featured in Grand Theft Auto IV as well as both episodic expansion packs The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony on in-game radio station Liberty Rock Radio 97.8. ==References== Category:Aerosmith songs Category:The Breeders songs Category:Songs about sexuality Category:Songs written by Steven Tyler Category:1974 songs Category:Song recordings produced by Jack Douglas (record producer) ","title":"Lord of the Thighs"},{"id":"9076070","text":"Carollo Engineers is an environmental engineering firm specializing in the planning, design, and construction management of water and wastewater facilities for municipal and public sector clients in the United States.

Like the midrash on the four other \\"megillot\\", it is included in the Midrash Rabbot. ==Structure and origin== This midrash is divided into eight chapters or sections (\\"parashiyyot\\"). It covers the whole text of the Biblical book, interpreting it verse by verse, with a mixture of literal and allegorical interpretations. The eight chapters terminate, respectively, with Ruth 1:2, 1:17, 1:21, 2:9, 3:7, 3:13, 4:15, and 4:19. As in Eichah Rabbah, the commentary proper on the Book of Ruth is preceded by a long introduction (petichta), which consists of several proems having no connection with one another. The commentary itself (except in chapters 1 and 7, where it follows directly upon the Biblical text) is generally introduced by one or more proems. It is composed in the spirit of the Palestinian aggadists, its main sources being the Jerusalem Talmud, Bereshit Rabbah, Vayikra Rabbah, and Eichah Rabbah. It would seem, moreover, that its author was opposed to the Babylonian Talmud; for in his interpretation of 4:7 (a passage which is omitted in the printed editions) he disparages that work. It is true that parallel passages are found in Shir ha-Shirim Rabbah (which Ruth Rabbah closely resembles regarding arrangement and mode of interpretation) and in Kohelet Rabbah. But nothing proves that Shir ha-Shirim Rabbah is anterior to Ruth Rabbah, while Kohelet Rabbah is recognized by modern scholars to be posterior to this midrash. It apparently contains no Babylonian aggadot, and, although in 1:3 (= 2:4) it gives the aggadic interpretation of I Chronicles 4:22, which is also found in Bava Batra 91b, it may be seen that the source in Bava Batra is a baraita and not a Babylonian aggadah. Thus Ruth Rabbah is one of the earlier midrashim, composed about the same time as or shortly after Shir ha-Shirim Rabbah. According to Zunz,G. V. ed. Brüll, p. 277, Frankfort- on-the-Main, 1892 Ruth Rabbah (as well as Shir ha-Shirim Rabbah and Kohelet Rabbah) was one of the sources of the Yelammedenu, Devarim Rabbah, Pesikta Rabbati, and Shemot Rabbah, being a medium between these midrashim and the older aggadah.Compare, however, Friedmann, introduction to his edition of Pesikta Rabbati, p. 25 == Examples of Aggadah == Ruth Rabbah is specially interesting from a cultural-historical point of view, in that it endeavors to throw light on the habits and conditions of the time in which the incidents of the Book of Ruth took place. Thus, interpreting the phrase \\"in the days when the judges judged\\" (Ruth 1:1), as \\"in the days when the people judged their judges,\\" the author argues that there was a time when the judges perverted their judgments so that they were held responsible by the people. But when was there such a time, and who were those judges? According to Rav, the judges were Barak and Deborah; according to R. Huna, Deborah, Barak, and Jael; and according to Joshua b. Levi, Ehud and Shamgar. The famine is circumstantially described; it was one of the ten great famines which afflicted the entire world. Elimelech is portrayed unfavorably, his name being interpreted as meaning \\"one eager for royalty.\\" He left the land of Canaan not because he would himself suffer from the famine, but because he was afraid that the people might ask him for help. In interpreting 1:14, the author of this midrash expresses his views with regard to kissing. According to an anonymous authority, kisses are permitted on three occasions only: on conferring a high office, as when Samuel kissed Saul;I Samuel 10:1 at meetings, as when Aaron kissed Moses;Exodus 4:27 and at parting, as when Orpah kissed her mother-in- law. According to R. Tanhuma, kissing is permitted also to relatives, as when Jacob kissed Rachel.Genesis 29:11 Under other circumstances kissing is declared indecent. The description of Ruth's insistence on following Naomi (Ruth 1:16-18) is very graphic, in that, when her attention was directed by her mother-in-law to the laws relating to proselytes, she accepted them all. Both Naomi and Ruth are described as righteous women whose acts were charitable. Ruth particularly is pointed out as being modest and of exemplary manners.2:5 In its interpretation of 3:3, the midrash shows the necessity of honoring Shabbat by wearing special garments. In 3:13 there is a version of the story of Elisha ben Abuyah, the main source of which is Hagigah 14b. The midrash terminates with a statement to the effect that the Messiah is to descend from Ruth through David. With regard to lexical interpretations, in certain cases the explanation of words is not contrary to grammatical rules, but sometimes, as in all the other midrashim, the interpretation is arbitrary. Thus, while \\"Elimelech\\" is interpreted as composed of \\"elai\\" and \\"melek\\" (= \\"to me belongs royalty\\"; compare above), \\"Naomi\\" as \\"she whose acts are agreeable,\\" and \\"Orpah\\" (from \\"'oref\\"=\\"the nape of the neck\\") as \\"she who turned her back [comp. Jeremiah 2:27 and elsewhere] upon her mother-in-law,\\" \\"Vayehi\\" is interpreted as an exclamation of sorrow; and \\"Ruth\\" (derived from ראה = \\"to see\\") as \\"she who saw or considered her mother-in-law's words.\\" For commentaries on and editions of Ruth Rabbah, see Eichah Rabbah, Esther Rabbah, and Kohelet Rabbah. == References == * :*Weiss, Dor, iii. 273-274, iv. 209; :*Winter and Wünsche, Die Jüdische Litteratur, i. 532 et seq.; :*Wünsche, Introduction to his German translation of Ruth Rabbah. ==Further reading== *A full translation of Ruth Rabbah can be found online at the Sefaria Project here: https://www.sefaria.org/Ruth_Rabbah?lang=en Ruth Category:Book of Ruth ","title":"Ruth Rabbah"},{"id":"9076205","text":"Tutunamayanlar (lit. the ones who cannot hold on; in English The Disconnected) is the first novel of Oğuz Atay, one of the most prominent Turkish authors of the twentieth century.

Guinea's trade unions and opposition parties called on President Lansana Conté to resign, accusing him of mismanaging the economy and abusing his authority. The strikers also accused Conté of personally securing the release of Mamadou Sylla and Fodé Soumah, both accused of corruption, from prison.\\"Guinea police clash with strikers\\", BBC News, January 22, 2007. The strike ended on January 27 with an agreement between Conté and the unions, according to which Conté would appoint a new prime minister; however, Conté's choice of Eugène Camara as prime minister was deemed unacceptable by the unions, and the strike resumed on February 12. Martial law was imposed on the same day. Nearly two weeks later, Conté agreed to choose a prime minister acceptable to the unions, and on February 26 he named Lansana Kouyaté as prime minister. The strike ended on February 27, and Kouyaté was sworn in on March 1. ==Background== Two general strikes had been held in 2006, but these were limited to Conakry. The 2007 protests were first visible in Conakry, where workers stayed at home and businesses were shut. The government responded by threatening to sack striking civil servants.\\"'Dead City' Protests Continue in Guinea into Second Day\\" , VOA News, January 11, 2007. Youths took to the streets, despite a ban on rallies.\\"Guinea police clash with strikers\\", BBC News, January 15, 2007. Action soon spread to the nation's bauxite mines, where labourers stopped work. On January 16, Conté offered to cut fuel duty, raise teachers' salaries and address police corruption. This was rejected by union leaders, who were then arrested but soon released.\\"Guinea anger over dead strikers\\", BBC News, January 18, 2007. ==January events== A general strike was called by the United Trade Union of Guinean Workers (the USTG) in an attempt to force the president to resign. Strike leaders said that Conté, who had ruled Guinea since seizing power in a 1984 coup, had become increasingly erratic. They cite repeated scares about his health, sudden and chaotic cabinet reshuffles and his recent personal intervention to free from jail two former allies accused of graft. The two main opposition parties in the nation, the Rally for the Guinean People and the Union of Republican Forces supported the strike, as did the National Council of Civil Society Organisations group of NGOs and the newly formed Civic Alliance.\\"GUINEA: Civil society crystallising around unions\\", IRIN Africa, January 11, 2007. Police were ordered to disperse crowds of protesters, numbering as many as 5,000, with tear gas. On January 17, two deaths from bullet wounds were reported in Conakry, and one in Labé. At least ten protesters had died by January 21. The biggest protest was called on January 22, with demonstrations in cities across the nation. In the ensuing battles between police and strikers, at least seventeen workers were killed. In Conakry, a crowd estimated at 30,000 marched on the National Assembly of Guinea, but were blocked at the 8 November Bridge, where the police allegedly opened fire. On January 23, the three most prominent trade unionists were arrested by Presidential troops: Rabiatou Sérah Diallo of the National Confederation of Guinean Workers, Ibrahima Fofana of the United Trade Union of Guinean Workers and Yamadou Touré of the National Organization of Free Unions of Guinea. They claimed to have received death threats from various sources, including Conté himself.\\"Guinea: ITUC demands the release of arrested trade union leaders\\", ITUC, January 23, 2007.

Many of the characters featured in season one of The Wire belong to this organization. Season 1 largely deals with the Baltimore Police Department setting up a Major Crimes Unit to investigate the Barksdale Organization, led by Avon Barksdale who is portrayed as the most powerful drug kingpin in Baltimore. The gang's criminal activities include heroin and cocaine dealing, homicides (including killing witnesses in criminal cases against the gang), and money laundering. Avon Barksdale's power in west Baltimore was established some time before the events of season 1. The Barksdale Organization started a turf war for the city's largest public housing project. When they won the war and got the prized Franklin Terrace Towers, they had the best drug territory in the city and dominated the illicit heroin trade in west Baltimore. The show starts sometime after these events. The Baltimore Police Department as a whole is portrayed as underfunded and apathetic. While the Major Crime Unit is able to arrest a number of people in the Barksdale Organization, including Avon, they lack the resources to build a strong enough case to permanently cripple the organization. All those arrested plead out and get light sentences (with the exception of Wee-Bey and D'Angelo). Avon's best friend and second in command Stringer Bell runs the organization until Avon is released from prison in season 3. Ultimately, a second prolonged investigation by the Major Crimes Unit, a bloody turf war with the emerging Stanfield Organization, and internal dissent led to the Barksdale Organization's collapse in the fall of 2004. With most of the Barksdale Organization in prison or dead, the Stanfield Organization becomes the dominant heroin dealership in west Baltimore. ==Structure== Avon ran the organization as a hierarchy with himself at the top and Stringer directly below him. Stringer oversees the entire drug operation and advises Avon on all matters. They were both isolated from the drugs, handling only money. Avon had a number of enforcers (soldiers) who served him through protection, contract killings, and intimidation work, including childhood friend Wee-Bey Brice. Avon himself kept an extremely low profile, eschewing overt displays of wealth so as not to attract attention, avoiding being photographed, not having a driver's license, and owning nothing in his own name. The Barksdales retained attorney Maurice Levy, who advised them on how to counter police investigations and represented members of the Barksdale organization at hearings and trials. At the beginning of the series, Avon is the top player in the West Baltimore drug trade. His territory includes the prized Franklin Terrace Towers, a massive public housing project consisting of six high rise apartment buildings. These towers provided the best territory in the city to sell drugs. The Barksdales have a crew at each tower that sells heroin and cocaine 24 hours a day. The Barksdales also control other smaller territories like a nearby low-rise housing project referred to as \\"the Pit\\". Each crew is headed by a lieutenant who is responsible for trade in a certain area, with some receiving a percentage of the revenue of the narcotics they sell. The lieutenants would contact their superiors to refill inventory and to kick up the proceeds from the drug sales. Lieutenants did none of the legwork in the drug transaction. They had to monitor their crew and make sure everything ran smoothly, only periodically collecting the proceeds from the drug sales and making sure everything adds up at the end of the day. Beneath the lieutenants there are several drug dealers usually referred to as \\"hoppers.\\" Typically there is a second-in-command who would handle the money, \\"touts\\" were responsible for attracting customers; \\"runners\\" would hand over drugs to the customer; \\"look-outs\\" were responsible for watching for police or stick-up gangs approaching, while others would watch over the main drug stash. Each dealer would receive a weekly cash payment for their work from the lieutenant above them based on hours worked. Every member of the organization was subject to strict rules designed to thwart police investigations. The dealers were not allowed to carry cell phones (initially) or use drugs. They were all aware of how to deal with police interrogation and knew that the organization would protect them if they did not say anything to the police. Lieutenants and enforcers carried pagers so that they could be contacted (they later used disposable cell phones). They were subject to the same rules as the dealers, but also knew not to talk business in cars, public places or with anyone outside of the organization. Such discussions were limited to property and territory owned by the Barksdale organization. A strict telephone usage policy was applied rigidly throughout the organization. The pager messages were encoded to prevent easy tracing of the telephones used, all of which were public telephones. When pages were returned with a phone call no names were supposed to be used, and if a name was used, the speaker was rebuked. A separate code was used for resupply signals, which involved turning the pager display upside down. When the police catch on to this method, the Barksdales start using disposable cell phones that are constantly replaced to avoid being wiretapped. Avon received his narcotics supply through a connection to a Dominican organization in New York and had several other options for suppliers in surrounding cities. The main supply of narcotics was separated from the rest of the organization and held in a house in Pimlico where it could be cut and divided into smaller \\"stashes\\" for distribution among the Barksdale territory. Once inside the towers, these smaller packages were moved from room to room on a regular basis, to avoid the scrutiny of police and stick-up men. Avon's main office was one of his front organizations, a strip club named Orlando's. It was here, behind a locked and heavily guarded door, that the drug money was counted and secured before being sent on to its ultimate destination. Avon usually conducted his business in this office, rarely venturing onto the street. The club's legal owner, Orlando Blocker, was kept away from the drugs in order to maintain the front's appearance of legitimacy for the city. The organization laundered its profits through various fronts, including a funeral parlor, Orlando's, and a property developing company named B&B.; It also invested in property, never actually using either Avon or Stringer's names on official papers. It also made campaign contributions and later bribes for assistance with development contracts. ==LeadershipAvon Barksdale=== Avon Barksdale is the head of the Barksdale organization. In season one, he is the target of an investigation of a Major Case Squad after homicide detective Jimmy McNulty, who seems to be the only authoritative figure aware of his presence or his empire, reveals his identity to his superiors. Avon is feared by other drug dealing criminal organizations in Baltimore due to his ferocity. He is portrayed as hotheaded yet is also a shrewd and intuitive gangster. His drug empire includes the best territory in Baltimore for drug dealers. Together with his closest friend Stringer, Avon and their enforcers dominate the heroin trade in West Baltimore. Despite Stringer's attempts to move the two towards legitimacy, Avon shows little interest in leaving the drug business or West Baltimore. ===Russell \\"Stringer\\" Bell=== Stringer (played by Idris Elba) is Avon Barksdale's second-in-command, closest friend, and the main strategist behind coordinating their street dealing organization which he does as the main contact for all business. He also attended community college to better understand business and economics and to apply them to the drug trade. Together, Stringer and Avon operate out of a strip club where they discuss business, conduct meetings with their subordinates and launder money. His greatest aspiration is to transition into the legitimate business world. Aside from wholesaling drug packages, Stringer wants to enter the business world and leave the violence. In the third season Stringer is killed by Omar Little and Brother Mouzone in his own commercial building that was in development at the time. ===Wee-Bey Brice=== Wee-Bey was the Barksdale organization's most trusted soldier, before being arrested in season one for multiple homicides. He becomes a connection for the crew and its members while they go through the system for lesser crimes. His family uses his trusted status in the crew to its fullest advantage and after he is arrested they attempt to carry on with dealings on the street as usual, updating him on their periodic visits to speak at the prison. ===Sean \\"Shamrock\\" McGinty=== Sean \\"Shamrock\\" McGinty, Stringer Bell loyalist, played by Richard Burton *Played by: Richard Burton *Appears in: :Season two: \\"Ebb Tide\\"; \\"Hot Shots\\"; \\"Hard Cases\\" and \\"Port in a Storm\\". :Season three: \\"Time After Time\\"; \\"All Due Respect\\"; \\"Dead Soldiers\\"; \\"Hamsterdam\\"; \\"Straight and True\\"; \\"Homecoming\\"; \\"Back Burners\\"; \\"Moral Midgetry\\"; \\"Slapstick\\"; \\"Reformation\\" and \\"Mission Accomplished\\". Shamrock was Stringer Bell's main assistant while Avon Barksdale was in prison. Stringer sounds out his loyalty by having him followed on a trip to Philadelphia to collect a package of drugs, along with Bodie Broadus. The package was not delivered correctly, but Shamrock and Bodie keep to Stringer's orders and meticulously document their progress, and Stringer is satisfied with their response. Stringer entrusts Shamrock with driving Bodie to dispose of the weapons used in a misguided territory war after a young child was killed by a stray bullet. Unfortunately Bodie unknowingly drops the bag of guns onto a passing barge instead of into the water. Little comes of the mistake because Bodie had already wiped the weapons clean of fingerprints. Stringer entrusts Shamrock with the set-up of CO Dwight Tilghman to allow Avon to exchange information about Tilghman with the prison authorities for an early parole hearing. Stringer, Shamrock and Country follow Tilghman and learn that he smuggles heroin from Butchie into the prison. Stringer has Shamrock deliver a package of tainted narcotics to Tilghman through Butchie, causing several deaths in the prison. Shamrock also plants narcotics in Tilghman's car to make sure Avon could successfully inform on Tilghman. By season three, Shamrock is Stringer's top assistant who oversees the technical aspects of the drug distribution to the various drug dealing crews. Shamrock oversees Stringer's organizational meetings at the funeral home and is told to keep to Robert's Rules of Order. He tries to keep minutes at the first meeting of the New Day Co-Op, a group of major Baltimore drug players; Stringer curtly reminds him that he is taking notes on a criminal conspiracy. Stringer uses Shamrock to insulate himself from the street; Shamrock takes phone calls on Stringer's behalf, then organizes face to face meetings at secure locations. Stringer put Shamrock in charge of overseeing Bernard in obtaining disposable cell phones used by the organization. Stringer insisted that Bernard buy a maximum of two phones from any one outlet. Once Shamrock takes over, he stops checking up on Bernard and Bernard begins to buy phones in bulk from Lester Freamon, an undercover officer in the Major Case unit investigating Stringer. Freamon is thereby able to supply the Barksdale's crew with pre-wiretapped phones. When Avon is paroled, Shamrock continues in his role as Stringer's assistant controlling their drug dealing through the lieutenants and crew chiefs. He is peripherally involved in Avon's turf war with Marlo Stanfield, passing messages back and forth to soldiers. Shamrock is arrested alongside Avon at the end of season three. ===Slim Charles=== Slim Charles was an enforcer hired by the Barksdales in season three when they needed muscle after the arrests of Savino, Wee-Bey and Bird and the deaths of Little Man and Stinkum. He proves himself to be capable and loyal on multiple occasions despite his lack of support. Upon Stringer Bell's death he became Avon Barksdale's second-in-command. After Avon's subsequent arrest, Slim Charles began working for Proposition Joe and the New Day Co-Op, an organization of which he eventually takes a leading role. ==SoldiersSeason one=== Bird *Played by: Fredro Starr *Appears in: :Season one: \\"The Pager\\" (uncredited) and \\"One Arrest\\". :Season two: \\"All Prologue\\". Marquis \\"Bird\\" Hilton is a foul-mouthed soldier in the Barksdale crew who is involved in the brutal murder of Omar Little's boyfriend and accomplice Brandon. As revenge, Omar cooperates with the police to provide testimony that Bird killed William Gant, a state witness against D'Angelo Barksdale as a warning to others not to testify. Because the police need a witness, Omar agrees to falsely testify that he saw Bird shoot Gant with his signature gun. Omar further tells the police they will find Bird taking drugs (contrary to the rules of the Barksdale organization) and that they should be careful, as Bird is reckless. The arrest is made, and a ballistics report matches Bird's gun to the killing. Before the police begin interrogating Bird, Landsman takes a photo of the injuries on Bird's face so that he can't claim they were inflicted in custody. Bird vehemently rejects their offer to provide information on the people he works for, throwing out as many foul-mouthed insults as he can. His vulgar attitude towards his interrogators prompts Daniels to tear up the Polaroid image, and then, along with Kima and Landsman, deliver a three-man beatdown. Largely because of Omar's testimony, Bird is convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment without parole by Judge Phelan. Little Man *Played by: Micaiah Jones *Appears in season one: \\"The Detail\\" (uncredited); \\"Lessons\\" (uncredited); \\"Game Day\\" (uncredited); \\"The Cost\\" (uncredited) and \\"The Hunt\\". Wintell \\"Little Man\\" Royce was a heavyset soldier in the Barksdale crew, responsible for enforcing their regime at the Franklin Towers, mainly Tower 221. He is responsible for handing bags of cash to senator Clay Davis' aide Damien \\"Day Day\\" Price. With Wee-Bey Brice, he is involved in the shooting of \\"Orlando\\" and specifically shot Detective Greggs because he was surprised by her presence. Stringer Bell decides that, with the police cracking down on them because an officer has been shot, they would be better off without the unreliable Little Man, and Wee-Bey kills him. The murder occurs offscreen, but Wee-Bey later tells the police where to find Little Man's body as part of his confession.

Perry was a soldier in the Barksdale organization, usually seen acting as security at the funeral home they use as a base of operations. He sometimes acts as a bodyguard for Avon Barksdale. He is playing video games with Rico when Omar Little robs a Barksdale stash house he was supposed to be keeping secure. Perry is one of those arrested for weapons violations at the Barksdale safehouse. Savino Bratton Savino Bratton was a soldier in the Barksdale Organization.

He is robbed during one such delivery by stick- up man Omar Little, later taking part in the brutal killing of Omar's accomplice and boyfriend Brandon in retribution. Stinkum is set to be a central piece of the Barksdale detail's case as their investigation progressed, amassing much evidence of him performing various illegal acts. The police seizes the resupply from his subordinate Kevin Johnston, but allow Stinkum to go free to avoid arousing suspicion about their surveillance methods. After being promoted by Avon Barksdale to run new territory for the organization, Stinkum is killed by Omar as revenge for Brandon. Roland \\"Wee-Bey\\" Brice Wee-Bey was the Barksdale organization's most trusted soldier, before being arrested in season one for multiple homicides. He becomes a connection for the crew and its members while they go through the system for lesser crimes. His family uses his trusted status in the crew to its fullest advantage and after he is arrested they attempt to carry on with dealings on the street as usual, updating him on their periodic visits to speak at the prison. ===Season two=== The Barksdale Organization (Season Two) Country *Played by: Addison Switzer *Appears in: :Season two: \\"Ebb Tide\\" (uncredited) and \\"Hot Shots\\" (uncredited). :Season three: \\"Time After Time\\" (uncredited); \\"All Due Respect\\"; \\"Straight and True\\" and \\"Homecoming\\". Country was a Barksdale soldier who returned to work for the organization as soon as he was released from prison, despite being on parole. His is first seen trailing Bodie and Shamrock to Philadelphia, to make sure they follow Stringer Bell's orders. He also works with Shamrock to set up crooked prison guard Dwight Tilghman so that Avon Barksdale could inform on Tilghman to reduce his prison sentence. During a later turf war between Barksdale and Marlo Stanfield, Country is one of Slim Charles' few voices of experience in a team of young soldiers, until he is killed in an attempted drive-by on one of Marlo Stanfield's corners. The driver, Chipper, refuses to follow Slim's orders to wait for a signal before making a move. Rico *Played by: Rico Whelchel *Appears in: :Season two: \\"Ebb Tide\\" (uncredited) :Season three: \\"Time After Time\\" (uncredited), \\"Dead Soldiers\\" (uncredited) and \\"Back Burners\\". Rico was a soldier in the Barksdale organization, usually seen acting as security at the funeral home they use as a base of operations. He is playing video games with Perry when Omar Little robs a Barksdale stash house he was supposed to be keeping secure, and was involved in the subsequent shootout. He is then assigned to provide security for Poot Carr's corner because of the turf war with Marlo Stanfield. Rico is killed in a drive-by shooting by Stanfield soldier Snoop against Poot's corner. Tank *Played by: Jonathan D. Wray *Appears in: :Season two: \\"Ebb Tide\\" (uncredited). :Season three: \\"Time After Time\\" (uncredited); \\"All Due Respect\\" (uncredited) and \\"Dead Soldiers\\". Tank was a Barksdale organization soldier. He was first seen working with Country checking up on newly promoted crew chief Bodie Broadus as he made a trip to collect a new package of narcotics. Later, in the third season, Tank is shown to be guarding Barksdale stash houses. Tank is killed by Kimmy from Omar Little's crew during a shootout following an aborted heist on the stash house he was guarding. ===Season three=== The Barksdale Organization (Season Three) Bernard *Played by: Melvin Jackson, Jr. *Appears in: :Season three: \\"Back Burners\\"; \\"Moral Midgetry\\"; \\"Slapstick\\"; \\"Reformation\\" and \\"Mission Accomplished\\". Bernard was a mule in the Barksdale organization given the task of buying their supply of disposable mobile phones used by the entire organization every two weeks in order to not be traced. \\"Shamrock\\" insists that Bernard buy no more than two phones at any one outlet (providing receipts to prove it) using rental cars to do so each time, per Stringer Bell's cautious instructions. Bernard's nagging girlfriend \\"Squeak\\", tired of the time spent repeatedly visiting dozens of stores while she accompanied him on these outings, puts Bernard in touch with an undercover Lester Freamon, who provides them with illegally re-charged phones at a lower price (and fake receipts), in actuality phones with pre- installed wiretaps. Information collected from these phones eventually brings down the Barksdale drug operations, including the arrest of Bernard and Squeak. Bernard says that he could not wait to go to jail to get away from Squeak, and does not seem to be entirely kidding. Cutty Cutty was a prisoner who became affiliated with the Barksdales when they needed muscle, recommended by his cellmate Wee-Bey. After Cutty's release from prison, he proves highly effective in the organization until he realizes that he is no longer willing to kill people, declaring \\"The game ain't in me no more\\". He leaves the organization on respectful terms from Avon, who later gives him money to start a boxing gym. Devonne *Played by: Tiara Harris *Appears in: :Season three:\\"Moral Midgetry\\" and \\"Reformation\\" Devonne is a young woman used by the Barksdale Organization as bait for Marlo Stanfield. She is first mentioned by Avon as a means to get close to Marlo Stanfield. She catches Marlo's attention in a club and he approaches her. Marlo checks that she is there with friends and declines both drinking and dancing. Instead they leave the club together. After they have sex in his car Devonne persuades him to meet her again the following day. Marlo phones Devonne to arrange a meeting and begins to feel suspicious. He assigns Chris Partlow to investigate Devonne. Snoop sits in the restaurant Marlo arranged to meet Devonne at and notices a Barksdale soldier buying a large quantity of food and taking it to a nearby SUV. Snoop reports in to Partlow. Partlow observes Devonne receiving a signal from the car figures out it is a trap. Marlo and Chris Partlow set up a night time ambush for Devonne. When she emerges from her home, Marlo shoots her once in each breast, then a third time through her mouth. Partlow assures him that the murder was necessary. She bears the distinction of being the only person that Marlo has personally murdered on-screen, as opposed to having Chris do it. Gerard *Played by: Leonard A. Anderson *Appears in season three: \\"Dead Soldiers\\" (uncredited); \\"Hamsterdam\\"; \\"Straight and True\\"; \\"Homecoming\\"; \\"Moral Midgetry\\"; \\"Slapstick\\" and \\"Mission Accomplished\\". Gerard was a dim Barksdale organization enforcer working under Slim Charles, though more intelligent than Sapper, who he usually works with. He is first seen guarding the front door during one of Omar Little's attempted heists. Later, Gerard, Sapper and Dennis \\"Cutty\\" Wise are charged with finding a thief in the Barksdale organization. Cutty's experience makes the task simple, and Gerard and Sapper punish the culprit with a savage beating. Gerard and Sapper are thrown out of Avon Barksdale's homecoming party when Barksdale saw them come in high. Gerard receives more work as the organization becomes embroiled in a turf war with Marlo Stanfield. He is almost killed in an attempted drive by where both Chipper and Country are killed, when Chipper, the driver, impatiently sets off early. Gerard and Sapper are later involved in the attempted shooting of Omar's grandmother, in violation of the Sunday truce. They are ordered by Avon Barksdale to replace a hat that they damaged in this unsanctioned action. Gerard is arrested at a Barksdale safehouse for weapons violations. Sapper *Played by: Brandan T. Tate *Appears in season three: \\"Dead Soldiers\\" (uncredited); \\"Hamsterdam\\"; \\"Straight and True\\"; \\"Moral Midgetry\\"; \\"Slapstick\\" and \\"Mission Accomplished\\". Sapper is a young idiotic Barksdale organization enforcer working under Slim Charles. He often works with Gerard, and seems to be the dumber of the two. He is probably best remembered for enthusiastically uttering the line \\"like a forty-degree day!\\" as he misunderstands a speech from Stringer Bell. Sapper is first seen guarding the back door during an attempted heist by Omar Little. Gerard, Sapper and Dennis \\"Cutty\\" Wise were charged with finding a thief in the Barksdale organization. Cutty's experience made the task simple and Gerard and Sapper punished the culprit with a savage beating. Gerard and Sapper were later thrown out of Avon Barksdale's homecoming party when Barksdale saw them come in high. Gerard and Sapper are later involved in the attempted shooting of Omar Little while Omar was with his grandmother after church, in violation of the Sunday truce. They are ordered by Avon Barksdale to replace a hat that they damaged in this unsanctioned action. Sapper is incarcerated at Avon's weapon stash house at the end of season 3. ==Drug dealersD'Angelo Barksdale=== D'Angelo Barksdale was Avon's nephew and a lieutenant in his drug dealing organization. He was mainly responsible for leading the corner boys in their street dealings and coordinating their earnings and performance. He was the main connection between the upper levels of the crew and the street kids that were selling the product. He struggles with the morality behind his trade and came close to informing on the crew because of it, only relenting because of loyalty to family ties his mother reminded him of before signing. He took the sentence and went to prison where he was killed by a hitman sent by Stringer Bell in season 2. ===Ronnie Mo=== *Played by: Jarvis W. George *Appears in season one: \\"The Detail\\" (uncredited), \\"Cleaning Up\\" and \\"Sentencing\\". \\"Ronnie Mo\\" Watkins ran the drug dealing operation in \\"The Pit\\" for the Barksdale organization before D'Angelo Barksdale. Ronnie Mo's promotion to overseeing Building 851 as a crew chief came just prior to the beginning of the series. Before the promotion, he worked with Bodie, Poot and Wallace in the low rises. Ronnie Mo is seen flirting with dancers at Avon's strip club. He is arrested by Herc, when the Barksdale investigation comes to an end, and is sentenced to fifteen years due to prior felonies. ===Bodie Broadus=== Bodie was a loyal drug dealer for the Barksdale organization who rose up in the ranks of the organization and was later left to run his own small independent crew after the organization fell apart. Eventually, he was forced to work for, and was subsequently killed by Marlo Stanfield's crew. ===Poot=== Poot is a loyal drug dealer for the Barksdale organization, who serves brief prison time for his crimes. By the end of the series he is working at a shoe store attempting to distance himself from the game after growing tired of it and reeling from the loss of many friends. ===Sterling=== *Played by: Curtis Montez *Appears in season one: \\"The Buys\\" (uncredited), \\"The Pager\\" and \\"Sentencing\\". Sterling is a drug dealer in the low rise projects (known as \\"the pit\\") under D'Angelo Barksdale. Sterling is in charge of the crew's stash of narcotics, giving vials of drugs to the runners when needed. When Omar Little robs the crew, Sterling refuses to tell him where the stash is hidden and Omar shoots him in the kneecap. When Stringer Bell asks D'Angelo to flush out leaks in his team, D'Angelo discovers that Sterling (along with Cass) is stealing from him. He lets them off with a warning and a demotion to lookouts. When Bodie Broadus takes over \\"The Pit\\", Sterling is involved in his efforts to drive off a rival crew and is seen wielding a baseball bat alongside Bodie and Poot. ===Wallace=== Wallace is a 16-year-old drug dealer in the Barksdale crew's low rise projects organization, who is looking after a number of younger children in the neighborhood. He tries to leave the drug trade over guilt for his role in the death of Brandon, Omar Little's boyfriend, and he informs on the Barksdale Organization for the police. He is subsequently murdered by his friends Poot Carr and Bodie Broadus, on orders from Stringer Bell. D'Angelo Barksdale, who had befriended Wallace, grows outraged when he learns of the murder; it drives a permanent wedge between D'Angelo and Stringer, and is one of the main factors that leads D'Angelo to want to leave \\"the game\\" himself. ===Puddin=== *Played by: De'Rodd Hearns *Appears in: :Season one: \\"The Hunt\\" (uncredited); \\"Sentencing\\" (uncredited) :Season two: \\"Ebb Tide\\"; \\"Stray Rounds\\" (uncredited); \\"Port in a Storm\\" and \\"Duck and Cover\\" (uncredited). :Season three: \\"Time After Time\\"; \\"All Due Respect\\"; \\"Dead Soldiers\\"; \\"Back Burners\\" and \\"Mission Accomplished\\" (uncredited). Herbert De'Rodd \\"Puddin'\\" Johnson is a drug dealer in Bodie Broadus' crew in the 221 Tower building for the Barksdale organization. Puddin handles the count for Bodie and also spends time with him and Poot Carr when they are not working. In season two, Puddin is involved in a shoot out that results in the death of a nine-year-old boy. Puddin stays with Bodie after the towers are demolished. Bodie is tasked with moving into Marlo Stanfield's territory, and his crew get into a turf war with a Stanfield crew led by Fruit. Puddin and his fellow dealers are severely beaten with baseball bats by Fruit, Jamal and a group of Stanfield soldiers as a warning to the Barksdale organization. Puddin is arrested along with Avon and many others in the organization at the end of season 3. Puddin is played by De'Rodd Hearns who also works in the post production department and is the half brother of DeAndre McCullough. DeAndre plays Lamar on The Wire and was the basis of a character in David Simon's The Corner. ===Kevin Johnston=== *Played by: Jimmy Jelani Manners *Appears in: \\"The Detail\\"; \\"One Arrest\\" Kevin Johnston is a drug dealer in season one, he is first seen when Roland \\"Prez\\" Pryzbylewski, Herc, and Carver go to the 221 towers and cause a bust without backup and Prez pistol-whips Johnston, leaving him blind in one eye. Kevin is later tailed by the police with Stinkum on their way to the low rise pit to drop four G packs of dope for D'Angelo's crew, Kevin jumps out of the car with the bag of drugs and is chased by the police at the pit and is arrested. He is interrogated by Lieutenant Daniels in an attempt to get Kevin become an informant against the Barksdale drug empire. Kevin refuses to say anything, comparing the proposition to being pimped by the police. He is not seen again and presumed to being in jail on drug charges. ==Legal representationMaurice Levy=== Levy was the Barksdale organization's lawyer. ==Front workersWendell \\"Orlando\\" Blocker=== *Played by: Clayton LeBouef *Appears in season one: \\"The Target\\"; \\"The Pager\\"; \\"One Arrest\\"; \\"Lessons\\"; \\"Game Day\\"; \\"The Cost\\" and \\"The Hunt\\". Orlando acted as a front operator for the Barksdale crew and ran their strip club, Orlando's. Orlando had ambitions to get involved with the drug dealing aspect of the organization but his superiors needed him to keep a clean record for the club's licensing. He approached D'Angelo Barksdale to try to involve him in cocaine dealing but D'Angelo refused and eventually told his uncle, Avon. Avon punished the wayward frontman with a humiliating beating. Orlando was later arrested when he tried to buy drugs from an undercover Maryland State Police officer, and agreed to inform on Barksdale for the police. While imprisoned for the charge he was spotted by another inmate loyal to the Barksdale crew who phoned in Orlando's whereabouts. He was visited by Barksdale organization lawyer Maurice Levy, who was there to take his name off the club's license rather than offer help. Orlando was killed by Barksdale soldiers Wee-Bey Brice and Little Man in a botched sting operation which also resulted in the shooting of detective Kima Greggs. ===Shardene Innes=== *Played by: Wendy Grantham *Appears in: :Season 1: \\"The Target\\"; \\"The Buys\\"; \\"The Pager\\"; \\"The Wire\\"; \\"Lessons\\"; \\"Game Day\\"; \\"The Cost\\"; \\"Cleaning Up\\"; \\"Sentencing\\". :Season 2: \\"All Prologue\\". :Season 5: \\"–30–\\" Shardene was a dancer at Orlando's, who deliberately ignored the illegal activity in the club because she wanted to make quick money. Her first meeting with D'Angelo Barksdale did not go well, but she later agreed to go out with him. Shardene and D'Angelo moved in together after seeing each other for a few months, and it was going well until Detectives Freamon and Greggs showed her the body of Keesha, another dancer from the club. D'Angelo had told her the girl was taken to a hospital following an overdose at a party; in reality, she had (unbeknownst to him) been left to die, wrapped in a carpet, and dumped by Wee- Bey Brice. She felt betrayed by D'Angelo and agreed to try to help the police however she safely could. Shardene moved out of D'Angelo's place soon after this. Kima and Freamon wired her with a microphone, and she attempted to get close to Barksdale's conversations with little success. Frightened, Shardene begged to be allowed to stop, but Freamon persuaded her to help them determine the floorplan of the club so they could install a hidden camera in Avon Barksdale's office, which ultimately led them to catch Avon incriminating himself on video. Freamon and Shardene grew close during the investigation, and by season 2 they were sharing an apartment. Although she was no longer a stripper (having been encouraged by Freamon to enroll in nursing school), she was able to help put the detectives in touch with some dancers when they were investigating the deaths of girls involved in the sex trade. In Season 5, in the series' penultimate episode, Freamon hopes Shardene is awake because he is \\"in the mood for love\\" as he prepares to return home after a celebratory drinking session with Bunk. Shardene appeared in the series finale with Lester as they celebrate with other policemen the \\"death\\" of Freamon and McNulty's careers as police. ==FamilyDonette=== Donette, played by Shamyl Brown, is the mother of D'Angelo's child. *Played by: Shamyl Brown *Appears in: :Season one: \\"The Detail\\"; \\"The Pager\\" and \\"The Cost\\". :Season two: \\"Hot Shots\\"; \\"Undertow\\"; and \\"Backwash\\" :Season three: \\"All Due Respect\\"; \\"Dead Soldiers\\"; \\"Hamsterdam\\"; \\"Homecoming\\"; \\"Back Burners\\" and \\"Mission Accomplished\\". Donette is drug lieutenant D'Angelo Barksdale's girlfriend in season 1 and is the mother of his son. Shortly after his acquittal, D'Angelo brings her to a party organized by Avon, where she first meets Stringer Bell. She often worries over her financial situation and nags D'Angelo for money. At one point, D'Angelo takes her to dinner at an upscale restaurant, and D'Angelo tries to explain his doubts about his lifestyle to her, but Donette dismisses his worries. D'Angelo begins seeing Shardene Innes behind Donette's back during the course of the season. After D'Angelo is arrested, Avon gives Donette an allowance as support money. Donette then gets involved with Stringer Bell while D'Angelo is in prison. She visits D'Angelo at Stringer's behest to try to ease the experience of prison for him. Stringer has mounting concerns that D'Angelo is going to reveal to the authorities information about the Barksdale organization's drug dealing, covertly orders him killed, and has the death staged to look like a suicide. In season 3, Jimmy McNulty reinvestigates D'Angelo's death and figures out what really happened. When he tries to use this information to coerce Donette into cooperating she refuses to talk to him. She passes the information about McNulty's visit on to D'Angelo's mother Brianna. Donette is shown in the montage at the end of season 3 weeping in her bedroom, having lost both D'Angelo and now Stringer Bell to the drug trade. This is Donette's last appearance in the series; the Barksdale organization is of only peripheral importance once Avon is imprisoned and Stringer is dead. ===Brianna Barksdale=== Brianna Barksdale, a criminal matriarch played by Michael Hyatt *Played by: Michael Hyatt *Appears in: :Season one: \\"Cleaning Up\\" and \\"Sentencing\\". :Season two: \\"Collateral Damage\\"; \\"All Prologue\\"; \\"Backwash\\" and \\"Stray Rounds\\". :Season three: \\"Straight and True\\"; \\"Homecoming\\"; \\"Moral Midgetry\\"; \\"Slapstick\\"; and \\"Mission Accomplished\\". :Season four: \\"Margin of Error\\". Brianna Barksdale is D'Angelo's mother and Avon's sister. Brianna grew up in West Baltimore, and her family has always been involved in the drug trade. With her brother Avon controlling narcotics on the West Side, Brianna acts as an advisor, helps to manage their profits, and receives a healthy income, nice home, and new car for her efforts. She raised her son to manage the tough streets and got him working in the family business as soon as he was old enough. D'Angelo was quickly made a lieutenant in Avon's operation despite some misgivings. She first appears bringing food to D'Angelo at work. Later, she is fiercely protective of her son when he is arrested for drug trafficking, insisting that Avon was wrong for sending him to pick up narcotics. Her brother promises to do everything he can to help D'Angelo. When D'Angelo is ready to turn against his family, Brianna visits him and changes his mind, convincing him to accept a lengthy prison sentence to protect Avon. When D'Angelo once more begins to withdraw from his family in prison, Brianna visits him to try to talk him around. This time, D'Angelo insists that he doesn't want to see her again. When D'Angelo is killed on Stringer's orders and his death staged to look like a suicide, Brianna is distraught. She is comforted by Stringer, oblivious to his complicity in D'Angelo's death. Brianna argues with Avon to allow Stringer to manage their business his way while Avon is imprisoned. When Avon is released, she continues to advise both men. Jimmy McNulty, doing off-the-books work into D'Angelo's murder, tells Donette about his suspicions. Donette passes the information on to Brianna. Brianna, suspicious, meets with McNulty and is convinced by the evidence, not the least when he rips into her over how she convinced D'Angelo to accept the harsh prison sentence in the first place. She confronts Avon and Stringer about McNulty's allegations and asks Avon, indirectly at first, if he ordered D'Angelo's killing. He truthfully denies any involvement (although Stringer has, by this point, admitted to Avon that he ordered the murder). Brianna is not convinced and begins to hold Avon responsible for D'Angelo's death. Brianna is left at the helm of what remains of the Barksdale empire when Avon is arrested and Stringer is killed. She is responsible for distributing their funds to family members of incarcerated crew members. For example, she pays De'Londa Brice to raise Wee-Bey's son, Namond. She eventually decides to cut off the families, stating that she has no further income and no need to protect Avon because of the rift in their relationship. She calls Namond and De'Londa to her home to give them the news and tries to ensure that Namond knows his mother has received more than enough to live on already. Brianna is not seen in season 5, but is mentioned as the recipient of a large cash sum from Marlo Stanfield as part of a deal with Avon to let Marlo directly contact the Greeks. ===De'Londa Brice=== De'Londa Brice played by Sandi McCree *Played by: Sandi McCree *Appears in season four: \\"Soft Eyes\\"; \\"Home Rooms\\" (uncredited); \\"Alliances\\"; \\"Margin of Error\\"; \\"Misgivings;\\" \\"A New Day;\\" \\"That's Got His Own\\"; \\"Final Grades\\". De'Londa is the mother of Namond Brice. Namond’s father Wee-Bey Brice is incarcerated for multiple homicides. Although De'Londa has adopted Wee-Bey's last name, they are not married. De'Londa raises her son using funds from the criminal organization Wee-Bey worked for, and she holds Wee-Bey in high regard as a male role model for Namond. She actively encourages Namond to get involved in Baltimore's drug trade and uses Wee-Bey's contacts to get him work. De'Londa owns her own home and spends a relatively large amount on clothes and jewelry compared to her neighbors. She ensures that Namond always wears expensive clothes even when he has misbehaved. De'Londa enjoys regular shopping trips to New York City and visits to Atlantic City while leaving Namond to care for himself. When Brianna Barksdale cuts De'Londa off from the Barksdale empire, De'Londa is left fuming. She decides the only way to support her way of life is to have her son work as a crew chief. She bosses one-time Barksdale lieutenant Bodie Broadus into giving Namond a package of his own and instructs Namond on how best to sell it but will not let him drop out of school for his new work. After De'Londa's confrontation with her son resulting in his running away, Wee-Bey, on the advice of Howard \\"Bunny\\" Colvin, insists that she let the boy go to follow his own path. De'Londa relents and the season's final episode concludes with Namond's having been unofficially adopted by the Colvin family. ==References== Category:The Wire characters Category:Fictional organized crime groups Category:Drug dealers of The Wire ","title":"Barksdale Organization"},{"id":"9076264","text":"Paavo Puurunen (born 28 August 1973 in Kuhmo, Kainuu) is a retired Finnish biathlete who competed at four Winter Olympics.

The members of this family differ from other sabellid tube worms in that they have a specialized operculum that blocks the entrance of their tubes when they withdraw into the tubes. In addition, serpulids secrete tubes of calcium carbonate. Serpulids are the most important biomineralizers among annelids. About 300 species in the family Serpulidae are known, all but one of which live in saline waters. The earliest serpulids are known from the Permian (Wordian to late Permian). The blood of most species of serpulid and sabellid worms contains the oxygen-binding pigment chlorocruorin. This is used to transport oxygen to the tissues. It has an affinity for carbon monoxide which is 570 times as strong as that of the haemoglobin found in human blood. Empty serpulid shells can sometimes be confused with the shells of a family of marine gastropod mollusks, the Vermetidae or worm snails. The most obvious difference is that serpulid shells are dull inside, whereas the molluscan vermetid shells are shiny inside. ==Selected genera== Pecten sp. with serpulid worm encrusters; Duck Harbor Beach on Cape Cod Bay, Wellfleet, Massachusetts. *Amplaria Knight-Jones, 1973 *Anomalorbis Vine, 1972 *Apomatus Philippi, 1844 *Bushiella Knight-Jones, 1973 *Capeospira Pillai, 1970 *Chitinopoma Levinsen, 1884 *Circeis Saint-Joseph, 1894 *Crucigera Benedict, 1887 *Dexiospira Caullery and Mesnil, 1897 *Dextralia Knight-Jones, 1973 *Ditrupa Berkeley, 1835 *Eulaeospira Pillai, 1970 *Ficopomatus Sauthern, 1921 *Filograna Berkeley, 1835 *Filogranella Ben-Eliahu and Dafni, 1979 *Filogranula Langerhans, 1884 *Galeolaria Lamarck, J.B. de (1818) *Hyalopotamus Marenzeller, 1878 *Hydroides Gunnerus, 1768 *Janua Saint-Joseph, 1894 *Josephella Caullery and Mesnil, 1896 *Leodora Saint-Joseph, 1894 *Metavermilia Bush, 1904 *Neodexiospira Pillai, 1970 *Neovermila Day, 1961 *Nidificaria *Paradexiospira Caullery and Mesnil, 1897 *Paralaeospira Caullery and Mesnil, 1897 *Pileolaria Claparede, 1870 *Placostegus Philippi, 1844 *Pomatoceros Philippi, 1844 *Pomatoleios Pixell, 1912 *Pomatostegus Schmarda, 1861 *Protolaeospira Pixell, 1912 *Protula Risso, 1826 *Pseudochitinopoma Zibrowius, 1969 *Pseudovermilia Bush, 1907 *Salmacina Claparede, 1870 *Semivermila Imajima, 1978 *Serpula Linnaeus, 1767 Type genus *Simplicaria Knight-Jones, 1973 *Spirobranchus Blainville, 1818 *Spirorbis Daudin, 1800 *Turbocavus Prentiss et al., 2014 *Vermiliopsis Saint-Joseph, 1894 *Vinearia Image:Ficopomatus enigmaticus individual and tubes.jpgFicopomatus enigmaticus Image:Filograna implexa.jpgFilograna implexa Image:Red fanworm1.jpgProtula bispiralis Image:Serpula vermicularis 2.jpgSerpula vermicularis Image:Christmas tree worms.jpgSpirobranchus giganteus Image:Spirorbe.jpgSpirorbis sp. ==References== ;Citations ;General * * * Category:Annelid families Category:Extant Permian first appearances ","title":"Serpulidae"},{"id":"9076322","text":"Administration office building Vytautas Magnus University Botanical Garden also known as the Kaunas Botanical Garden (; ), is a university botanical garden located in the south of the center of Kaunas city, Freda district, Ž.E.Žilibero str. 6. With an area of it is the second largest in Lithuania. This institution is a member of BGCI, with international identification code KAUN. ==About Garden== First director - Constantin von Regel Botanical Garden was founded in 1923 as the centre of botanical sciences that belonged to Lithuanian (later Vytautas Magnus) University. Spacious green area with the old park, picturesque ponds and several buildings of the former estate of Juozapas Godlevskis (Aukstosios Fredos estate) was provided for establishing botanical garden at that time. Professor Constantin Regel from Tartu University was invited to direct Kaunas Botanical Garden. The detailed project for the garden landscape was made in 1924 by architect Karol Rauth from Hanover. With the help of other botanical gardens, especially Berlin's Dahlem, Königsberg and St. Petersburg's Kaunas Botanical Garden built up very rapidly. The construction of the Greenhouse was finished in 1938. Presently, Vytautas Magnus University Botanical Garden occupies the area of 62.5 ha close to the city center. It is multifunctional university botanical garden that consists of three departments: Science, Expositions and Collections, and Service and Education. The Science department is divided into three sectors: Medicinal and Spice Plants, Dendrology and Phytopathology, and Pomology. Department of Expositions and Collections includes sectors of Plant systematics, Floriculture and Greenhouse. The unique feature of this garden is peaceful and green environment created by an advantageous combination of cultural and natural heritage. Botanical expositions and collections, the Greenhouse, big landscape park with an interesting pond system – this is not only place for plant conservation and research but also area for all modern forms of interactive education, cultural tourism and community use. Kaunas Botanical Garden accepts more than 90 thousands visitors per year. Vytautas Magnus University Botanical Garden is a member of the Lithuanian Association of University Botanical Gardens (LAUBG), the Association of Baltic Botanic Gardens (ABBG), the Botanic Garden Conservation International (BGCI) and the Network of Botanic Gardens in the Baltic Sea region.Botanic Gardens in the Baltic Sea region ==Directors== ==Collections== Accession Number: 14783 Special Collections: Rosa – 1577, Dahlia – 1481, Tulipa – 457, Hemerocallis - 452, Paeonia - 306, Rhododendron - 251, Hosta - 241, Lilium - 228, Astilbe - 194, Aster - 134 collection numbers. ==Gallery== Image:Freda09.jpgThe pond in the Botanical Garden File:Вход в парк.jpgEntrance to the garden File:Botanikos sodo oranžerija.jpgPalmhouse File:Цветение тюльпанов в апреле.jpgTulips File:Kaunas botanical garden.JPGOrnamental plants File:Цветение магнолии в апреле.jpgMagnolias File:Kauno botanikos sodas3, 2005-06-09.jpgWoody Plant Collection File:Kauno botanikos sodas 2007-06-08.JPGGreenhouse in 2007 ==References== ==External links== *Official website *Vytautas Magnus University Botanical Garden in Kaunas on BGCI Category:Botanical gardens in Lithuania Category:Buildings and structures in Kaunas Category:Research institutes in Lithuania Category:Research institutes in the Soviet Union Category:Botanical research institutes Category:1923 establishments in Lithuania Category:Tourist attractions in Kaunas ","title":"Vytautas Magnus University Botanical Garden"},{"id":"9076342","text":"Pólo Norte ao Vivo was the fourth album of the Portuguese band Pólo Norte.

Omar and his associates make their living robbing drug dealers. For the first three seasons, Omar mainly targets the Barksdale Organization. Later, he goes after the Stanfield Organization, culminating with a robbery of the entire New Day Co-Op. Omar and his crew never go after any \\"citizens\\" uninvolved in the drug trade. His crew typically comprises Baltimore stick-up artists whose motive for collaborating with Omar is the money associated with robbing drug dealers and stash houses. Omar is gay, and many other members of his crew have a LGBT background (e.g., Omar's boyfriends) ==LeadershipOmar Little=== Omar Little is a legendary Baltimore stick-up thief and Robin Hood character, who steals from drug dealers while whistling, \\"A Hunting We Will Go\\". (Sometimes, the tune is characterized as \\"The Farmer in the Dell\\", as in season 1, episode 5 - \\"The Pager\\", when he concludes with, \\"the cheese stands alone, motherfucker\\".) Omar is unanimously disliked and feared by several drug dealers throughout the city, as his heists of their drugs and money hit them hard; in contrast his moral code keeps him on good terms with some Baltimore police. His bold robberies make him a hero amongst corner and neighborhood kids, and he proves to be one of The Wire characters with integrity and intelligence, including those who make mistakes, but own up to and learn from those errors in judgement. ===Butchie=== \\"Mostly blind\\" Butchie is Omar Little's bank, advisor, and close friend. Butchie runs a West-Side Baltimore bar. ==Omar's boyfriendsBrandon Wright=== *Played by: Michael Kevin Darnall *Appears in season 1: \\"The Buys\\"; \\"Old Cases\\"; \\"The Pager\\" and \\"The Wire\\". Brandon was Omar Little's boyfriend and a member of his stick-up crew. Brandon mistakenly used Omar's name in front of Barksdale drug dealers as they robbed their stash in the low rise projects; the name was reported back and started a long running feud between Omar and the Barksdale organization. Avon Barksdale placed bounties on all of Omar's crew. Brandon was spotted by Wallace and Poot Carr playing pinball at \\"The Greek's\\" - a restaurant on the west side. They alerted D'Angelo Barksdale to the find who passed the message to Stringer Bell. Stringer arrived with three Barksdale enforcers Marquis \\"Bird\\" Hilton, Roland \\"Wee-Bey\\" Brice and Anton \\"Stinkum\\" Artis. Brandon was captured by Bell's crew, tortured, and killed, his body displayed in the low rise projects as a warning to Omar on Avon's instructions. Afterward, Omar escalated their feud, refusing to relent after the ruthlessness shown, repeatedly referencing Brandon's murder as unnecessarily harsh. ===Dante=== *Played by: Ernest Waddell *Appears in: :Season 2: \\"Hot Shots\\". :Season 3: \\"All Due Respect\\"; \\"Dead Soldiers\\"; \\"Straight and True\\"; \\"Homecoming\\"; \\"Moral Midgetry\\"; \\"Slapstick\\"; \\"Reformation\\" and \\"Mission Accomplished\\". Dante becomes Omar Little's new boyfriend and stick-up crew member in the year following Brandon's death. Dante is jealous when Omar adds Kimmy and Tosha Mitchell to the crew. In season 3, Dante accidentally kills Tosha during a gunfight that ensues while they are fleeing a heavily guarded Barksdale stash house, after a failed attempt at a stick-up (confirmed by commentary from David Simon and further dialogue in Episode 7), exacerbating the rift between Dante and the surviving Kimmy. Dante is kidnapped by Brother Mouzone and his associate Lamar in their effort to locate Omar. Dante provides them with the necessary information after enduring a beating, notably less brutal than that which Brandon was able to endure. He is released after the conclusion of Omar and Mouzone's successful conspiracy to kill Stringer Bell. Dante was replaced by Renaldo in season 4, but there was no explanation given for his departure after season 3. ===Renaldo=== *Played by: Ramón Rodríguez *Appears in :Season 4: \\"Home Rooms;\\" \\"Refugees;\\" \\"Misgivings;\\" \\"A New Day;\\" \\"That's Got His Own;\\" and \\"Final Grades.\\" :Season 5: \\"Not for Attribution\\". Renaldo is Omar's partner in season 4 and appears assisting him in the robbery of various drug dealers. Renaldo owns a taxi that he and Omar frequently use for surveillance of their targets. Renaldo is the show's first main Hispanic character and introduces other Hispanic characters into the show to assist in the robbery of the New Day Co- Op in the episode \\"That's Got His Own\\". Following the heist Omar and Renaldo leave Baltimore for an idyllic retirement in Puerto Rico, but Omar is compelled to return to Baltimore when Butchie is killed. Renaldo is not seen again after Butchie's death. ==OthersJohn Bailey=== *Played by: Lance Williams *Appears in season 1: \\"The Buys\\"; \\"Old Cases\\" and \\"The Pager\\". Bailey was a member of Omar Little's stick-up crew who assisted him in robbing the Barksdale organization. Bailey was killed shortly afterwards, while visiting relatives. When arrested, Barksdale enforcer Wee-Bey Brice confessed to the murder. Bailey was known for having many enemies. ===Kimmy=== *Played by: Kelli R. Brown *Appears in: :Season 2: \\"Hot Shots\\" and \\"Bad Dreams\\". :Season 3: \\"All Due Respect\\"; \\"Dead Soldiers\\"; \\"Straight and True\\"; \\"Homecoming\\"; \\"Moral Midgetry\\" and \\"Slapstick\\". :Season 4: \\"That's Got His Own\\" and \\"Final Grades\\". Kimmy and Tosha Mitchell were lovers and associates in robbing drug dealers. Omar Little returned to Baltimore and persuaded them both to join his crew. Kimmy was adept at infiltrating drug dealing operations, using a number of disguises including that of a nurse to Omar's disabled veteran. Tosha was accidentally killed by Omar's boyfriend Dante, in a shoot-out following a heist on a Barksdale stash, leaving Kimmy distraught. When Omar persisted in his vendetta against the Barksdale organization, Kimmy decided to leave Omar's crew, stating that there were easier people to rob. Kimmy reunites with Omar in an elaborate plot to steal Proposition Joe's large drug shipment meant for his co-op. Following the successful heist, Kimmy takes her cut of stolen drugs and tells Omar that she will now retire from this profession. ===Tosha Mitchell=== *Played by: Edwina Findley *Appears in: :Season 2: \\"Hot Shots\\" and \\"Bad Dreams\\". :Season 3: \\"All Due Respect\\" and \\"Dead Soldiers\\". Tosha Mitchell and Kimmy were lovers and associates in robbing drug dealers. Omar Little returned to Baltimore and persuaded them both to join his crew. Tosha was accidentally killed by Omar's boyfriend Dante, during a shoot-out following a heist. ===Big Guy=== *Played by: Derrick Purvey *Appears in: :Season 4: \\"Margin of Error\\" (uncredited), \\"Unto Others\\" and \\"That's Got His Own\\" (uncredited) :Season 5: \\"Not for Attribution\\" and \\"Transitions\\" (uncredited) Big Guy is a friend of Butchie's who works in his bar and acts as muscle for him. When Omar Little is arrested Butchie sends Big Guy and Donnie to protect him, and they both deliberately get imprisoned. Big Guy is at the bar when Chris Partlow and Snoop ambush Butchie, and is shot in the leg. The Stanfield enforcers kill Butchie, and Big Guy is left alive as a witness. Big Guy tells his story to Omar upon his return to Baltimore. ===Donnie=== *Played by: Donnie Andrews *Appears in: :Season 4: \\"Margin of Error\\" (uncredited), \\"Unto Others\\", \\"That's Got His Own\\" (uncredited) and \\"Final Grades\\" (uncredited) :Season 5: \\"Transitions\\" and \\"React Quotes\\" Donnie is a friend of Butchie's who acts as muscle for him. When Omar Little is arrested Butchie sends Big Guy and Donnie to protect him, and they both deliberately get imprisoned. Donnie joins Omar in seeking revenge after the Stanfield Organization tortures and killed Butchie. Donnie suggests they target Monk, a Stanfield lieutenant. Chris Partlow sets an ambush for Omar and Donnie at Monk's apartment, and Donnie is shot and killed by Michael Lee and Chris. Donnie was played by Larry \\"Donnie\\" Andrews, whose real life exploits inspired much of the character of Omar. Andrews was married to Francine Boyd, whom David Simon wrote about in The Corner. ==References== Category:The Wire characters Category:Fictional outlaws ","title":"Omar Little and associates"},{"id":"9076353","text":"Christian Peder Kryssing (July 7, 1891 – July 7, 1976), commonly known as C.P. Kryssing, was a Danish collaborator with Nazi Germany during World War II. An artillery officer and an ardent anti-communist, he commanded the Free Corps Denmark from 1941 to 1942. He was not a member of the Danish Nazi party, the National Socialist Workers' Party of Denmark. Kryssing became the first commander of the Free Corps Denmark June 29, 1941, but was discharged as commander on February 23, 1942, because of disagreements between him and officers in the unit who had Nazi leanings. His replacement was a pro-National Socialist Dane, Christian Frederik von Schalburg. Kryssing was then transferred to other German units, first SS Division Totenkopf and later 5th SS Division Wiking. In February 1944 he became commander of SS-Kampfgruppe Küste but resigned in June the same year because of personal issues. Kryssing was the highest ranked foreigner in Waffen-SS as a SS-Brigadeführer. In May 1945 Kryssing surrendered to the British forces and was handed over to the Danish Police in June 1946. On October 27, 1947, he was sentenced to four years’ imprisonment for his membership of Waffen-SS but was released in May 1948.

Stocking Jr. (December 28, 1928July 13, 2013) was a German-born American scholar noted for his scholarship on the history of anthropology. ==Early life and education== Stocking was born in Berlin, Germany in 1928. His father, the economist George W. Stocking Sr., was conducting research on the German potash industry. Stocking senior moved frequently to take different academic positions, as well as to conduct research and undertake policy and applied work. As a result, George Stocking Jr. moved around frequently as a child. The majority of his childhood, however, was spent in Texas, where his father was a professor at the University of Texas at Austin. He graduated from high school in New York, however, where he graduated from Horace-Mann Lincoln School in 1944. ==Career== Stocking went on to attend Harvard University. He graduated from Harvard in 1949. From 1949 to 1956 he was a member of the Communist Party, taking a number of jobs in manufacturing and industry an attempt to organize workers. Eventually Stocking grew disaffected with politics, and in 1957 he entered graduate school at the University of Pennsylvania. There, he was a student in the interdisciplinary program on \\"American Civilization\\", where he was a student of A. Irving Hallowell. In 1960 he earned his Ph.D. with a dissertation entitled \\"American Social Scientists and Race Theory: 1890–1915\\". Stocking's work was a content analysis of articles written by academics and intellectuals, and was influenced by social-scientific thought current in the American Civilization program at the time. Nevertheless, his work is usually classified as history and he is usually considered a historian. Stocking's first academic position was at the University of California Berkeley, where he was hired in 1959 as a social historian. He subsequently taught for a semester at the University of Pennsylvania in 1967. In 1968 Stocking took a position at the University of Chicago, where he had a joint appointment in the departments of anthropology and history for some years. He moved to a full position in anthropology in 1974. Stocking's scholarly work takes several forms. He has published several volumes which anthologize already-published journal articles. These include Race, Culture, and Evolution (1968), The Ethnographer's Magic (1992), and Delimiting Anthropology (2001). Stocking has also edited the work of other scholars. Work in this vein includes The Shaping of American Anthropology (1974), an anthology of writings by Franz Boas. as well as Selected Papers from the American Anthropologist (1976). Most notably, he was the editor in chief of the annual book series \\"History of Anthropology\\" published by the University of Wisconsin Press. In 1973, in conjunction with Robert Bieder and Judith Modell, he founded the History of Anthropology Newsletter as \\"a medium of communication for active researchers in this area\\" providing \\"information as to archival holdings, bibliographic aids, research in progress, recent publications, and so on.\\" In addition to these works, Stocking has produced several monographs. Most notably these include two volumes which trace the history of British anthropology: Victorian Anthropology (1987) and After Tylor (1995). He has also written an autobiography, Glimpses into my own Black Box (2010) and the exhibition catalog Anthropology at Chicago (1979). ==Criticism== In 1964, Stocking published an influential article entitled ‘French Anthropology in 1800’, in the journal Isis (vol. 55, part. 2, no. 180, pp. 134–50). In it, he mistakenly suggested that the French zoologist François Péron was an advocate of polygenism. He was challenged by Péron’s biographer, Edward Duyker, who asserted that ‘one of Péron’s most significant anthropological findings’ was the recognition of ‘strong physical and cultural differences’ between the inhabitants of Tasmania and mainland Australia. These differences, and the absence of the dingo in Tasmania, led Péron to conclude, in a memoir he presented to the Institut de France, that ‘la séparation de ces deux régions doit remonter à une époque beaucoup plus ancienne qu’on ne pourroit le soupçonner d’abord’ [‘the separation of these two regions must have dated from an époque very much more ancient than one could suspect at first’].‘Mémoire sur quelques faits zoologiques applicables à la théorie du globe, lu à la Classe des Sciences physiques et mathématiques de l’Institut national (Séance du 30 vendémiaire an XIII)’, p. 478. Duyker pointed out that Stocking had mistranslated this crucial statement as: ‘before the epoch of the population of these countries’, to justify his erroneous assertion about Péron’s belief in distinct human creations. ==Later life and death== Stocking was a professor emeritus in the Department of Anthropology at the University of Chicago. He died in 2013 after years of declining health.Vitello, Paul. \\"George Stocking Jr., 'Anthropology's Anthropologist,' Dies at 84\\". New York Times, July 29, 2013. == Legacy == Upon his death, an article in the Indian Country Today Media Network called Stocking \\"The Man Who Forced Anthropologists to Respect Native Cultures\\". ==Bibliography== In addition to the titles listed below Stocking has edited many works, been the editor of the series History of Anthropology, and contributed to many journals.

Stocking Jr."},{"id":"9076372","text":"On the fictional television drama The Wire, the Stanfield Organization is a criminal organization led by Marlo Stanfield. The Organization is introduced in Season Three of The Wire as a growing and significantly violent drug syndicate. Marlo has established his organization's power in West Baltimore's main streets in the shadow of the dominating Barksdale Organization, which was more concerned with conducting its activities in the Franklin Terrace Towers. The Stanfield Organization violently clashes with the Barksdale crew after the latter is forced to move on from the demolished Franklin Terrace Towers and tries to reclaim the streets the gang once dominated. Marlo's is the only crew in the area not to let itself be absorbed into the feared Barksdale gang, and a violent turf war breaks out. The Stanfield Organization begins as the underdog, but fallout from the strain of the war combined with internal strife among the Barksdale Organization leadership, the organization's ongoing war with stickup man Omar Little and a successful investigation by the Major Crimes Unit manages to destroy the Barksdale Organization at the end of Season Three. By Season Four, Marlo's crew becomes the most powerful drug organization in West Baltimore, and forms an alliance with the New Day Co-Op while ruling its streets through fear. In Season Five, after a period of aggressive expansion which culminates in Marlo seizing control of the Co-Op, a series of arrests and deaths destroy the organization. The Stanfield Organization is arguably the most violent and ruthless of the drug trade organizations portrayed in The Wire. ==Leadership== The Stanfield Organization ===Marlo Stanfield=== Stanfield is a rising gang leader who gets into a turf war with the Barksdale Organization, becoming the key West Baltimore drug kingpin following Stringer Bell's death and Avon Barksdale's arrest. Stanfield is played by Jamie Hector. ===Chris Partlow=== Partlow is Marlo Stanfield's second-in-command in his drug dealing operation. He is played by Gbenga Akinnagbe. ===Monk Metcalf=== Monk is a lieutenant in the Stanfield organization, and the third most recognized leader of the Stanfield Organization. ==SoldiersSavino Bratton=== *Played by: Chris Clanton *Appears in: :Season one: \\"The Target\\" (uncredited); \\"The Detail\\" (uncredited); \\"Lessons\\" (uncredited); \\"Game Day\\"; \\"The Cost\\" and \\"The Hunt\\". :Season five: \\"More with Less\\" (uncredited), \\"The Dickensian Aspect\\" and \\"Took\\". Savino is one of five prominent enforcers of the Barksdale Organization in Season 1. He is shown as a cocky, but loyal soldier to his crew, evident by his lack of reluctance to take the fall for one of the organization's mishaps with the police and spend time in prison. Savino was not as involved in the more delicate violent operations of the organization compared to fellow soldiers Marquis \\"Bird\\" Hilton and Anton \\"Stinkum\\" Artis, but was still important enough to conduct business under his chief enforcer, Roland \\"Wee-Bey\\" Brice. Savino was one of the members present during D'Angelo Barksdale's court case to intimidate anyone in the courtroom looking to cause complications or trouble. Savino was notably the only upper-tier member of the Barksdale Organization not actively targeted by Omar Little, as he was not directly involved in the murder of Omar's boyfriend Brandon Wright. However, he was soon caught up in the covert investigation into the crew by the Major Crimes Unit when he was involved in the shooting of Detective Greggs and Orlando. After the Barksdale crew realizes Orlando was cooperating with the police, Savino met with Orlando and Greggs— who posed as Orlando's girlfriend —and together they drove to a secluded location for a drug buy. Savino left the car, ostensibly to pick up Orlando's drugs, allowing enforcers Wee-Bey Brice and Little Man to reveal themselves and shoot into the car. Before the shooting, Savino tried to signal them about Greggs' unplanned presence, only intending to kill the turncoat Orlando, but the darkness made them unable to see him and they followed through with the plan, killing Orlando and severely wounding Greggs. Afterward, warrants were written for Savino, the only person involved in the shooting known to the police beforehand, and he turned himself in after an unproductive manhunt. Barksdale attorney Maurice Levy argued that Savino was merely intending to defraud Orlando—selling him baking soda instead of cocaine— and was unconnected to the shooting, forcing the District Attorney to charge him with distributing false narcotics, which only carries a maximum three-year prison sentence. When the police try to convince him to turn evidence on the Barksdale crew, Savino cockily says \\"I can do the three. Ain't no thing.\\" By Season 5, Savino is one of remaining Barksdale survivors alive and not imprisoned; by this time his three-year sentence was up and he was released from prison, soon operating as a soldier in the Stanfield Organization. Savino involved himself in the Stanfield crew's hunt for Omar after the latter returned for the death of Butchie and narrowly escaped an ambush attempt by Chris Partlow, Snoop, O-Dog and Michael Lee. Savino's activities were soon recognized and he was eventually ambushed in a corner by Omar Little, who after a brief conversation, killed Savino with a single gunshot to the head, in revenge for the torture-murder of Butchie by Chris Partlow and Snoop. Omar identified him as a past Barksdale soldier and, knowing his violent history, refused to accept Savino's explanation that he was not present at the incident, reasoning that if Savino had been there he would have joined in with the others. After Omar's own death, the police found his \\"hit-list\\" and discover all the upper-tier members of the Stanfield Organization he planned to kill. Savino's name was the only one crossed out, which means he was ultimately the only major casualty of Omar's gang war, and ironically the last casualty of his past hatred of the Barksdale Organization. ===Melvin \\"Cheese\\" Wagstaff=== Cheese is the favorite nephew of Proposition Joe and a crew chief in his Eastside drug crew. But later joins Marlo for a short time before Marlo's retirement. In which leads to him and Slim Charles taking over the Stanfield Organization for an even shorter time and ultimately killed by Slim Charles as revenge for Proposition Joe. He is played by actor/musician Method Man from the Wu-Tang Clan. He is also the father of student character Randy Wagstaff. The show never depicts the actual relationship. Randy Wagstaff is the character who ends up in group homes after his house is burned down as a result of his perceived cooperation with law enforcement. ===Felicia \\"Snoop\\" Pearson=== *Played by: Felicia Pearson One of the chief enforcers in the Stanfield Organization, along with Chris Partlow. ===Michael Lee=== Michael Lee is a soft-spoken middle school pupil who gets taken under the wing of Stanfield and Partlow in season four and trained as a soldier. Michael is played by Tristan Wilds. He also serves as a de facto guardian for his half-brother Bug. It is strongly implied that he was abused by his stepfather Devar (Bug's father). By the end of the series, with the Stanfield Organization dissolved, Michael actions parallel those of Omar Little, as he goes into hiding, stays independent of any other dealers, and emerges only to rob those involved in the drug trade with a shotgun. ===O-Dog=== *Played by: Darrell Britt-Gibson *Appears in :Season four: \\"Refugees\\" (uncredited); \\"Corner Boys;\\" \\"That's Got His Own\\" (uncredited) and \\"Final Grades.\\" :Season five: \\"More With Less\\" (uncredited), \\"Unconfirmed Reports\\", \\"React Quotes\\", \\"Late Editions\\" O-Dog, real name Darius Hill, is a teenage soldier who is being trained to kill by Chris Partlow and Snoop Pearson in the fourth season. He is one of two prominent soldiers to arise from the second generation of Stanfield street recruits, the other being Michael Lee. O-Dog identifies closer with Snoop than Michael and consequently develops into a colder, more reckless soldier; this is in stark contrast to Michael, who seems to adopt Chris's lethal but cautious attitude. O-Dog is first seen delivering a package to Bodie, and throughout the season he guards Marlo and accompanies Snoop and Chris as extra muscle. He is one of the soldiers responsible for subduing Little Kevin and sending him to his death. He is also seen hanging out with Michael Lee when Monk Metcalf shoots Dennis \\"Cutty\\" Wise, showing little empathy for Cutty. Along with Chris and Snoop, he is responsible for the execution of Bodie at the end of season 4. O-Dog exits a vacant and fires a shot to Bodie's head while he focuses on defending himself from Chris and Snoop, and fires another shot to the head once Bodie is down, earning him the nods of respect from Chris and Snoop. His status within the organization makes him one of nine active targets listed on Omar's hitlist. When Marlo orders a hit on a rival dealer's corner, O-Dog suggests a drive-by which fails. In an ambush on Omar Little and Donnie at Monk's apartment, O-Dog is shot in the leg by Omar. He is consequently relegated to the sidelines and is chosen by Chris and Snoop to take responsibility for their gun charges. When the leadership of the organization are detained in custody, O-Dog is shown regrouping with Snoop and Michael at the latter's apartment. He is last seen here wondering if he still has to take responsibility for the gun charges. ==DealersBodie Broadus=== Bodie was a dealer who came of age working for Avon Barksdale. After the Barksdale organization dissolves, he is briefly independent (supplied by the New Day Co- Op) until Marlo forces him to join his crew. He is shot and killed by O-Dog, after Monk sees Bodie having a conversation with McNulty, because Marlo suspects he may be a snitch. ===Poot Carr=== Poot is a loyal drug dealer for the Barksdale organization, who serves brief prison time for his crimes. By the end of the series he is working at a shoe store attempting to distance himself from the game after growing tired of it and reeling from the loss of many friends. ===Namond Brice=== Namond is the Son of Barksdale Main Soldier Wee-Bey Brice and works for Bodie who has problems with Namond but doesn't mention anything out of respect for his father. Later work for Marlo after Bodie is forced to join Marlo and his gang where he gets his own package. Howard \\"Bunny\\" Colvin later persuades Wee-Bey that although Namond may act tough, he is really not cut out for the corners and the life of a drug dealer, and that he has a lot of potential academically. Colvin adopts Namond, who is later seen to be excelling having left the streets behind. ===Duquan \\"Dukie\\" Weems=== Duquan is a friend of Michael and Namond. He lives in extreme poverty and often smells, and is frequently teased by many of the boys in the \\"Fayette Street Mafia\\". In season 4, his teacher \\"Mr. Prezbo\\" takes him under his wing, giving him clean clothes and food. In Mr. Prezbo's class Duquan is happy and thriving, and becomes the class computer expert. At the end of season 4, Duquan is \\"socially promoted\\" to high school due to his age. Rather than face the violence and intimidation of high school life, Duquan turns to the streets, where he starts slinging dope. He works for Michael in Season 5 for a short time due to not getting respect from Michael's crew. He later becomes Michael's brother's babysitter and eventually a drug addict. Duquan's character shows the realistic struggle and a sink or swim lifestyle of inner city youth living in poverty and violence. Duquan is one of the show's most tragic characters. The tragedy is the loss of support for intelligent kind natured children who find it difficult to find a place in society. Duquan excels when given clean clothes, food and a computer. However, since all these resources were provided by Mr. Prezbo, Duquan must leave these resources and is forced back into the streets. The tragedy turns grimmer as Duquan loses all social support because he is too young to be employed, but too old to stay with Mr. Prezbo. Duquan, after finding no place in the violent or illegal world, wanders into the lost world of the street addict. The last scene shows him injecting drugs in a horse stable used by his friend. This scene is quite disturbing to the viewer who sees Duquan's character slowly lose path. With the right support Duquan could have excelled as a student, but his meek, kindly nature ultimately leads to his own demise. He also wears a light blue shirt with bubbles, indicating Bubbles being succeeded by Dukie as a tragic addict. ===Fruit=== *Played by: Brandon Fobbs *Appears in: :Season three: \\"Time after Time\\"; \\"All Due Respect\\"; \\"Dead Soldiers\\"; \\"Hamsterdam\\"; \\"Homecoming\\"; \\"Reformation\\" and \\"Mission Accomplished\\". :Season four: \\"Boys of Summer\\". Fruit is a prominent crew chief of one of Marlo Stanfield's drug dealing crews, and works closely with Jamal and Justin. Fruit is identifiable by his ever-present Kangol hat, and is the chief for one of West Baltimore's most prominent street corners. He is first seen negotiating with Dennis \\"Cutty\\" Wise over how to distribute a package of dope; he seems to be fair, but he later rips Cutty off, saying the package was taken by the police. Cutty protests, but Fruit pulls a gun on him and forces Cutty to withdraw. Later in the season, his crew's territory is encroached upon by Bodie Broadus and his crew, which sparks the turf war with the Barksdale organization. Fruit is pressured by Marlo to force the Barksdale Organization away, and Fruit responds by gathering his muscle and beating most of the crew into submission with baseball bats. Cutty, now working for the Barksdale organization, takes part in the subsequent retaliation strike against Fruit's corner. Slim Charles kills one of Fruit's dealers, but Fruit escapes death because Cutty is unable to bring himself to kill again. In \\"Boys of Summer\\", the season four premiere, Fruit is seen leaving an afterhours nightspot with a woman, Patrice. As he is walking through the parking lot, he is killed by a single gunshot to the head by Lex, the father of Patrice's child. Lex shows little regret for his actions, only replying with \\"Sup Patrice?\\" Fruit's death causes Marlo to order an immediate retaliation hit on his killer, Lex. ===Jamal=== *Played by: Melvin T. Russell *Appears in :Season three: \\"Time after Time\\"; \\"All Due Respect\\"; \\"Dead Soldiers\\"; \\"Reformation\\" and \\"Mission Accomplished\\". :Season four: \\"Unto Others\\" (uncredited) Jamal is a young drug dealer in Fruit's crew. He is often seen with Justin. Jamal took part in the beating of Puddin as part of a turf war between Stanfield and the Barksdale organization. His role in the beating earned him the respect of Fruit. Justin and Jamal later discovered the body of Stanfield drug dealer LaTroy and the two fled the streets in fear of their own safety. He is later seen ridiculing Cutty as he approaches Spider on the corner. ===Justin=== *Played by: Justin Burley *Appears in: :Season three: \\"Time after Time\\" (uncredited); \\"Hamsterdam\\" (uncredited); \\"Reformation\\" (uncredited); \\"Middle Ground\\" and \\"Mission Accomplished\\". :Season four: \\"Soft Eyes\\"; \\"Refugees\\"; \\"Unto Others\\" (uncredited). Justin is a young drug dealer in Fruit's crew. He is identifiable by his baseball cap, which he wears sideways (which was the subject of a brief conversation with Thomas \\"Herc\\" Hauk and Ellis Carver). He discovered the body of Stanfield drug dealer LaTroy with his colleague Jamal and the two fled the streets in fear of their own safety. Toward the end of season three, he gets involved with Dennis \\"Cutty\\" Wise and his boxing gym. At first, he resists Cutty's attempts to teach and instill discipline, but he eventually settles down and is seen sparring with (and losing to) a smaller boxer from another gym. In season 4, Justin continues to attend Cutty's gym and train as a boxer. As the gym grows, Justin develops a superior attitude to more casual users of the equipment. He provokes a fight with Michael Lee over use of the heavy bag when he is preparing for a fight but Cutty calmly breaks the pair up. Justin became more accepting of Michael over time and the two attended a professional boxing match along with Cutty. It can be assumed as he is no longer seen, that Justin was successfully saved from the streets by Cutty's efforts. ===Boo=== *Played by: Unknown *Appears in: Time After Time; Homecoming Boo is a minor corner boy, he normally works on Fruit's corner and he is later shot to death by Slim Charles in a drive-by. ===Kenard=== Kenard is a younger member of Namond Brice's circle of friends (also known as the Fayette Street Mafia). He is first seen in season three, where, following a prolonged gunfight at a Barksdale stashhouse, Kenard argues with his friends over which one gets to pretend to be Omar Little while playing in the area and re-enacting the gunfight. In season four, he is frequently seen hanging out with the Fayette Street Mafia, usually making fun of Duquan \\"Dukie\\" Weems. He works with Donut and Randy Wagstaff delivering flyers on election day. He also works with Namond, Donut and Byron selling drugs. Despite being the youngest of his friends he is consistently the most profane. Namond makes him his lieutenant and allows him to store their package of narcotics. After attempting to steal from Namond, Kenard is savagely beaten by Michael. However, in the Season 4 finale, Kenard is seen working on Michael's new corner with Dukie. Kenard approached Roland \\"Prez\\" Pryzbylewski, who was watching Dukie from afar, for a drug purchase. While working on Michael's corner in season 5, Kenard and company are held at gunpoint by Omar who is on a mission to terrorize Marlo Stanfield's corners in an attempt to lure him into the streets. Kenard is underwhelmed at the sight of Omar due to him being on a crutch because of an injury from a shootout with some of Stanfield's enforcers, including Michael. While in an alley with some friends, dousing a cat with lighter fluid, and apparently planning to light the cat, Kenard sees Omar approaching. The rest of his friends run while Kenard remains and then proceeds to trail Omar as he robs a Stanfield corner. He follows Omar into a Korean owned grocery store and shoots him in the head, instantly killing him. In fear, he drops the gun and flees. In the series finale, Kenard is shown during the closing montage, being led away by Detective Crutchfield, the detective in charge of investigating Omar's murder. ===Little Kevin=== *Played by: Tyrell Baker *Appears in: :Season one: \\"The Target\\" (uncredited) :Season three: \\"Time after Time\\" (uncredited); \\"Hamsterdam\\" (uncredited); \\"Reformation\\" (uncredited); \\"Middle Ground\\" and \\"Mission Accomplished\\". :Season four: \\"Boys of Summer\\"; \\"Soft Eyes\\"; \\"Refugees\\"; \\"Unto Others\\" (uncredited), \\"Know Your Place\\", \\"Misgivings\\". Little Kevin is a teenage drug dealer working for Bodie Broadus in season four. Kevin's nickname is a play on his weight; he is in fact the most obese drug dealer in their crew. He first appears telling Randy Wagstaff to send fellow drug dealer Lex to meet a girl, where Chris Partlow and Snoop are waiting for him. They then murder Lex. After Randy tells Detective Thomas \\"Herc\\" Hauk this, Herc and Dozerman brought everyone in Bodie's crew under 5'6\\" and 150 lbs, not realizing the nickname was ironic. When Kevin's identity is confirmed, he is sent to Central Booking after refusing to cooperate in Herc's interrogation. Upon telling Bodie about his brief arrest and being hit with a charge of giving a false statement, Bodie and Poot tell him to tell Marlo Stanfield so as to convince him that he wasn't informing the police. When Kevin tells Marlo that he had used Randy as go-between in Lex's murder, Marlo has Kevin killed. While Bodie is unaware that Little Kevin betrayed Lex in an earlier episode, he is still livid because he strongly feels that Marlo killed Little Kevin \\"just because he could\\". ===Spider=== *Played by: Edward Green *Appears in: :Season three: \\"Hamsterdam\\" (uncredited); \\"Homecoming\\" (uncredited); \\"Middle Ground;\\" and \\"Mission Accomplished.\\" :Season four: \\"Margin of Error\\" (uncredited). :Season five: \\"More with Less\\", \\"Not for Attribution\\", \\"Transitions\\", \\"React Quotes\\" (uncredited), \\"Took\\", \\"Late Editions\\", and \\"–30–.\\" Spider is a teenage drug dealer working for Bodie Broadus in season three. He also boxes at Dennis \\"Cutty\\" Wise's community gym. He is first seen at Howard \\"Bunny\\" Colvin's disastrous meeting with young drug dealers to convince them to move to his tolerant zones. Bodie later puts him to work in \\"Hamsterdam\\". He is one of the dealers robbed in the house jewellery set-up. Along with Justin he is singled out for fighting by Ellis Carver who introduces him to Cutty. Spider befriends Justin and becomes a regular user of the gym by season four. Cutty alienates Spider when he sleeps with his mother and shortly afterwards, Spider returns to the corner. When Cutty attempts to persuade Spider to get off the corner, he responds that Cutty is not his father. He is then seen in the same crew as Sherrod and later with Bodie's crew. After Bodie is murdered by one of Stanfield's crew members at the end of season 4, Spider is seen working under Michael Lee at the beginning of season 5. He beats up Duquan \\"Dukie\\" Weems in \\"React Quotes\\" after Dukie knocks down Kenard. Spider is last seen in the season 5 series ending montage as the new crew chief of Bodie's and Michael's former corner. Spider's ending signifies the beginning of a new generation of drug lords and renewed cycle of the drug trade. ==FrontsVinson=== *Played by: Norris Davis *Appears in :Season three: \\"All Due Respect\\"; \\"Homecoming\\"; \\"Slapstick\\"; \\"Reformation\\" and \\"Mission Accomplished\\". :Season five: \\"React Quotes\\"; and \\"–30–\\". Vinson was an advisor to Marlo Stanfield, acting also as his personal bank, and also runs a rim shop where Marlo often operates. During season three, he gives Stanfield advice on how to deal with his rival Avon Barksdale when Avon is released from prison. He continues to counsel Stanfield once he becomes embroiled in a turf war with Barksdale. He also acts as a liaison between Stanfield and Proposition Joe as Joe attempts to negotiate an end to the turf war. It is Vinson who identifies Omar Little to Brother Mouzone on Mouzone's return to Baltimore seeking revenge. In season four, Marlo continues to use Vinson's rim shop as an occasional meeting place, though Vinson does not appear. Vinson appears in season 5 in the episode \\"React Quotes\\" at a meeting at the rim shop berating Monk for wearing a bulletproof vest. At the end of the series finale, Vinson is robbed and shot in the knee by Michael Lee. ===Old Face Andre=== *Played by: Alfonso Christian Lover *Appears in season four: \\"Soft Eyes\\"; \\"Home Rooms\\"; \\"Refugees\\"; \\"Alliances\\"; \\"Corner Boys\\"; \\"Know Your Place\\". Andre has a West side convenience store which serves as a stash house for Marlo Stanfield. He gets into Marlo's debt when the stash is robbed by Omar Little. Marlo is unforgiving and takes Andre's prized ring as a punishment. When Marlo is robbed by Omar, he includes Andre in his plan to get revenge on Omar. Chris Partlow murders a delivery woman in the store, telling Andre to call the police and say Omar did it. Under interrogation from Michael Crutchfield and Vernon Holley, Andre is given a photo array of suspects where he quickly identifies Omar as responsible. Bunk Moreland believes Omar is innocent, and visits Andre's store. After talking Holley into coming with him to the crime scene, Bunk disproves Andre's identification of Omar. Holley and Bunk bring Andre in on a subpoena to court. Bunk asks the grand jury prosecutor what a perjury charge carries (10 years maximum) causing Andre to retract his original story. Andre looks to Proposition Joe for protection from Marlo, not realizing Marlo has recently joined Proposition Joe's New Day Co-Op. Andre grudgingly gives Proposition Joe ownership of his store in exchange for $2,000 and a safe ride out of Baltimore. Instead of taking Andre out of town, Slim Charles escorts him to a back alley where he is greeted by Marlo's enforcers Chris and Snoop. Chris rebukes Andre's plea to not hide his body in a vacant building but promises to keep it quick as they walk him off to his execution. ==References== Category:The Wire characters Category:Fictional organized crime groups Category:Drug dealers of The Wire ","title":"Stanfield Organization"},{"id":"9076379","text":"Mars Hill is a mountain located in Mars Hill, Maine, and gave the town its name.

When he was three years old, his family moved to Hickory, North Carolina, where he lived until he moved to eastern North Carolina circa 1926. Also in 1926, he married Elizabeth \\"Frankie\\" Mae Johnson. By 1933, Long was working in Kinston, North Carolina, as the manager of the regional chain, the United Dollar Store. During an interview in the 1970s, Long recalled: > I'd always loved music ... down in Kinston, the farmers were coming in > selling tobacco. ... I got this old phonograph out and began to pile a few > records in. The more I played, the more they stayed. ... So from that basis > on I ordered a few records and they [the United Dollar Store] began to buy > 'em and sell 'em there. Everybody thought that the radios'd kill the record > business, but I satisfied so many people that I went ahead and ordered more > and more [records].Kip Lornell, \\"J.B. Long,\\" Living Blues, vol. 29, (Sept- > Oct 1976) It was also while he was in Kinston that he first began recruiting local music talent to make recordings. In early 1934, people began coming by his store asking for a song about a deadly wreck between a train and a car in nearby Lumberton, North Carolina; Long found out that no such song existed, but received permission from the American Record Corporation (whose records he was selling through the store) to have someone record the song. Long wrote the song, with the help of a local female journalist, and titled the song the \\"Lumberton Wreck\\". He held a local talent contest for white musicians, and a group by the name of the Cauley Family from nearby Duplin County, North Carolina won the contest, recording the song (and 23 others) in a three-day New York City recording session August 7–9, 1934. It was the only time Long recorded a white musician or group. Long began recording African American groups after holding a local talent contest for black musicians at the nearby Old Central Warehouse in June 1934. The winner of this first black contest was the Mitchell's Christian Singers, a local Kinston gospel quartet. In late 1934, due to his success as the manager of the Kinston store, the United Dollar Store company transferred Long to Durham, North Carolina, a larger, more important store. In 1935, Long and his family moved to Burlington, North Carolina, again as the manager of the United Dollar Store. He later became owner-operator of the Burlington Discount Department Store on West Davis Street. Also in 1935, Long was made the southern regional talent scout for the Columbia Recording Corporation, a subsidiary of the Columbia Broadcasting Corporation. Several times a year he traveled with various musicians and bands that he had \\"discovered\\" to New York City or Chicago to make recordings of their songs. Not long afterwards, the Rev. Gary Davis (an ordained Baptist minister) was discovered by Long, and soon thereafter, Long arranged for Davis to make his first trip to New York City, where he recorded 15 sides between July 23 and July 26, 1935. Perhaps his most famous talent discovery was Fulton Allen, Long bestowing on him the pseudonym \\"Blind Boy Fuller.\\" Long is credited with helping to write several of Fuller's songs. In July 1937, Fuller travelled to New York City to record for the Decca label; since he had never signed a contract with Long, Long bluffed Decca, telling Decca that he had an exclusive contract with Fuller. Because of this, Long made sure he had a signed contract with Fuller after that, which placed him under Long's permanent management. In 1938, Blind Boy Fuller's friend and bandmate, washboard player George Washington (aka Bull City Red), introduced Brownie McGhee to Long. Because Fuller was unable to make the recording session, Long persuaded Columbia to give McGhee an audition. McGhee's first recording session was on August 6, 1940, lasted for two days, and produced 12 sides. Following Fuller's death in February 1941, Long promoted McGhee as \\"Blind Boy Fuller #2\\". Regarding the common-held perception that Long exploited the musicians he represented, McGhee said: > A lot of people give J.B. Long a hard time, but I don't give J.B. Long a > hard time. I thought he was a marvelous fellow. He may not have given me > every dime I was supposed to get, but how much did I know I was supposed to > get?

On the other hand, Sonny Terry, the longtime performing partner of Brownie McGhee, had a different impression of Long, stating: “I’ll tell you something about J. B. Long, he had a mean streak in him back in them days. There’s two ways of looking at a man like that. He helped people get recorded, but he made money on it himself and a lot of times got copyrights on songs he never wrote…. And what you noticed most was it was you out on the streets scufflin’, trying to get by, not him.” In June 1939, Long was elected mayor of the city of Elon College, North Carolina. Between 1952 and 1972, he served five terms as a member of the Alamance County Board of Commissioners. He died on February 25, 1975, and was buried in the Magnolia Cemetery, in Elon, North Carolina. ==References== ==External links== *Site of the United Department Stores building in Durham, North Carolina — via Open Durham Category:1903 births Category:1975 deaths Category:Talent managers Category:American writers about music Category:A&R; people Category:People from Hickory, North Carolina Category:Mayors of places in North Carolina Category:20th-century American non-fiction writers Category:20th-century American politicians Category:People from Alamance County, North Carolina ","title":"J.

Richard Corden of Creaming Jesus, Patrick \\"Patch\\" Hannan of The Sundays, and Patch's friend, the producer Warren Huart, responded to the ad. Star 69's first two EPs were recorded in Patch's recording studio, Blah Street, in 1996 and released by Organic Records. Julie wanted to move back to Los Angeles, but Hannan's position as drummer for The Sundays meant he had to record the album Static & Silence. The band eventually relocated to Los Angeles Hannan was replaced by Johnny Haro of Freak of Nature. Their album, Eating February, was released by MCA Records in the U.S. and by Radioactive Records in the UK in February, 1997. It received a relatively lukewarm response, and the band broke up soon after. After the group disbanded, Huart then joined Disappointment Incorporated who released an album in 1999 on Time Bomb Recordings. He has since become a successful record producer and musician, and wrote the score to the 2004 documentary film following Joe Strummer, Let's Rock Again! Johnny Haro went on to form The Dreaming, which was active from 2001 to 2018. The group's song, \\"I'm Insane\\", was used by comic book writer Devin Grayson as inspiration while writing Catwoman. Julie contributed a single \\"You Should Know\\" for disc two of the compilation album Acoustic Vol 1, released in February 2002, and has since moved back to the United Kingdom to live with her husband. ==DiscographyStudio albums=== * Eating February (1997), LP, Radioactive Records, MCA Records ===Singles & EPs=== * \\"Mama Don't Let\\" (1995), Single, Organic Records * You Are Here (1995), Single/EP, Organic Records, Radioactive Records, MCA Records * Xtended Play (1996), EP, Radioactive Records * I'm Insane (1996), Single/EP, Radioactive Records * \\"Burning Down the House\\" (1997), Single, Radioactive Records ===Compilation album appearances=== * \\"I'm Insane\\", song 6 on Meaty Alternative Stew (1997), Chrysalis Music Group * \\"Burning Down the House\\", song 6 on Chrysalis Progressive (1997), Chrysalis Music Group ==References== ==External links== * Interview by Alphonse Leong in Drop-D magazine * Interview in Pause & Play from November, 1996 ===Reviews=== * Live, 1 March 1997 at the Starfish Room, Vancouver BC * Live, 27 May 1997 at The Metro, Chicago IL * Live, 1 June 1997 at Graceland, Vancouver BC (opening for Gene) * By Jeremy Rogers of the Kentucky Kernel * By Mary Ellen Gustafson from music- reviewer.com * By Ingrid Messer of the Daily Illini Category:English rock music groups ","title":"Star 69 (band)"},{"id":"9076489","text":"Rudrabhatta was an influential 12th-century Kannada poet in the court of the Hoysala Empire King Veera Ballala II(r.1173–1220 CE). According to Kannada language expert Narasimhacharya, the poet was also patronized by a minister of the King.Narasimhacharya (1988), p20 The literary critic Mukherjee feels that after a century of literary revolution caused by the Veerashaiva poets, a benevolent atmosphere created by the king may have encouraged this Vaishnava writer and poet.Mukherjee (1999), p333 ==Magnum opus== Rudrabhatta was a Brahmin and a Smartha (believer of monistic philosophy). Based on the Sanskrit classic Vishnu Purana, he wrote the epic Jagannatha Vijaya in the Champu metrical form (mixed prose-verse). The epic kavya (a narrative poem) describes the life of the Hindu god Krishna leading up to his fight with the demon Banasura. In this work, Rudrabhatta envisions the Hindu gods Hari (Vishnu), Hara (Shiva) and Brahma as one composite supreme deity (Parabrahma) who takes the form of the god Krishna (an avatar of Vishnu). According to Dalal, Rudrabhatta influenced later day notable Kannada poets such as Kumaravyasa and Lakshmisha, and Haridasa (carnatic music) composers such as Purandaradasa and Kanakadasa.Dalal (2011), p347 The Kannada scholar L.S. Sheshagiri Rao feels Rudrabhatta was essentially a poet for the learned classes.Sastri (1955), p364Rao in Datta (1988), p1181 However, according to the literary critic Shiva Kumar, though Rudrabhatta's form was ancient, his content is more medieval, making him a poet of transition in Kannada literature. Shiva Prakash and Dalal consider him adept at both the mainstream (marga) and the native (desi) styles of composition.Shiva Prakash in Ayyappa Paniker (1997), p203 Based on epigraphs from the period of Veera Ballala II, the scholar Narasimhacharya dates Jagannatha Vijaya to about 1180 CE.Narasimhacharya (1988), p39 According to the scholar Sreekantaiyya, based on internal evidence, the authorship of an important Sanskrit classic called Rasakalika is assignable to Rudrabhatta. According to him, references made by the later day Kannada poet Salva (1550 CE) in his writing Rasaratnakara gives the required evidence. Sreekantaiyya feels the author of a Sanskrit book (on love and aesthetics in poetry) called Sringaratilaka, who goes by the same name, is not the Rudrabhatta of the Hoysala court. According to Dalal, the author of Sringaratilaka belonged to the 10th century and also goes by the name Rudratta.Srikantaiya (2001), p35 According to Sankaranarayanan, Rudrabhatta's Rasakalika played an important role in the development of Indian aesthetics. It was the source for poet Vidyanatha's work Prataparudriya. The poet Vasudeva quotes from Rasakalika in his comments on the writing Karpurmanjari by Rajasekhara. He feels that today's scholars have not fully recognized the influence of Rudrabhatta of the Hoysala court. ==See also== *Hoysala literature *Kannada literature ==References== Citations Bibliography * Sastri, Nilakanta K.A.

28 October 1930) was born in Ferreñafe in the Lambayeque Region of Peru. He was one of the pioneers of the exploration of north-eastern Peru and a scientist of many talents - a natural historian, geographer, historian, geologist, archeologist and linguist.http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~herediasittig/pp/I9505.html Genealogy and biography of El Hombre del Marañón, Gerardo Saavedra Mesones, El Peruano, 1 November 2003 ==Early life== At the age of six his parents sent him to be educated in Germany, where he studied at the prestigious universities of Bremen and Hamburg before returning home to Peru aged 26, to begin a distinguished career as an explorer. http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~herediasittig/pp/I9505.html Genealogy and biography of El Hombre del Marañón, Gerardo Saavedra Mesones, El Peruano, 1 November 2003 Mesones Muro is also cousin for Alfredo Solf y Muro. ==Exploration of the Andes== Finding a route through the Andes to link the forested interior of Peru with the Pacific Ocean was a longstanding challenge. By the end of the 19th century many detailed technical and economic studies had been undertaken but Mesones Muro was the first to embark on the task of exploring all the regions of Peru in order to identify a route for the much anticipated railroad. ==\\"The Marañón Man\\"== Through his explorations Mesones Muro's name became permanently associated with that of one of the major tributaries of the Amazon River. One of his biographers baptised him \\"el hombre del Marañón\\" - \\"the Marañón man\\". The idea of opening up an outlet to the Pacific Ocean for Peru's Amazon region dates back to 1843. One proposal envisaged a journey of 650 km, starting from Piura. The author, Jorge von Hassel, was convinced that no low level route existed across the high Andes. Powerful political and economic interests were already planning the construction of the proposed railroad when on April 10, 1902, Mesones Muro, at the time completely unknown, published a documented letter in Lima in which he suggested that the starting point for the shortest route to the Marañon should be Puerto Etėn. Arguing with authority and a command of all the information available he also pointed to the advantage conferred by the 48 km of track already built between Etėn and Ferreñafe. Mesones Muro immediately set about organising an exploratory expedition, funded with his own savings. His aim was to find the solution that best served the national interest. He set out on May 18, 1902 on an expedition that was to take him on an extraordinary adventure through the Rupa-Rupa forest ending with the first trip through the Pongo de Manseriche gorge and the discovery of the Paso de Porculla, at 2,144 m above sea level the lowest point in the Andes range. Mesones's companions on this expedition were Enrique Brüning and the engineer Eduardo de Habich. Having overcome countless obstacles, the members of the expedition returned home and Mesones himself set off for Lima, where he described the expedition's findings to the Geographical Society, causing a sensation when he revealed the existence in the Cordillera del Norte of a mountain pass only slightly higher than 2,000 m. and announced that the Pongo de Manseriche gorge was in fact navigable. However, because of opposition from vested interests this heralded the start of a period of physical hardship and personal distress for Mesones Muro. Either through bad faith or a lack of interest, all discussion of the route through to the Marañón River ceased. With even greater determination Mesones Muro returned to his study of maps, planes, historical accounts and anything else that might be useful to him in work that very few other people understood. He was a man ahead of his time. His imagination conjured up visions of regional projects that integrated railroads with ports, rivers, navigation systems, telegraphs, etc. The idea of diverting the Huancabamba River to irrigate vast areas of land in the basin of the Pacific Ocean came to him in one such moment of inspiration. When a dispute broke out with Ecuador during the Presidency of Guillermo Billinghurst, he travelled immediately to Lima to offer his services to his country. Ten years after his previous expedition, with his high-minded enthusiasm once again enabling him to overcome the indifference and parsimony of Government authorities and employees, he sailed down the Marañón River to Iquitos in record time to show how it was possible to defend the region. As if that was not enough, he set off to make the return journey upriver through the Pongo de Manseriche gorge in a motorboat. Back in Lima, he embarked on a vain campaign to challenge the lack of strategic vision that resulted in wasteful expenditure on small-scale projects. The only result of his efforts to gain official support for his way of seeing things was that Government employees took to referring to him as \\"el loco Marañon\\" (the Marañon madman). Determined to prove that he was right he spent every cent he had preparing the \\"First commercial expedition from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean\\". During the Presidency of Augusto B. Leguía he saw one of his most costly visions - the diversion of the Huancabamba River towards the Pacific Ocean - come close to realisation and then collapse. Finally in his last years he was appointed director of the Brüning Museum in Lambayeque, a position from which he was dismissed shortly before his death in hospital. ==References== Category:Amazonas Region Category:Peruvian explorers Category:1930 deaths Category:1862 births ","title":"Manuel Antonio Mesones Muro"},{"id":"9076517","text":"The Fountain Formation is a Pennsylvanian bedrock unit consisting primarily of conglomerate, sandstone, or arkose, in the states of Colorado and Wyoming in the United States, along the east side of the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains, and along the west edge of the Denver Basin. ==Origin of name== The Fountain Formation was named by geologist W.

It consisted of the present-day nations of Colombia and Panama and parts of northwestern Brazil. In turn, the Granadine Confederation was replaced by the United States of Colombia after another constitutional change in 1863. ==History== The short but complicated life of the Granadine Confederation was marked by rivalry between the Conservative Party and the Liberal Party, which ended in a Civil War (1860–1862). It also was a period of hostility against the Roman Catholic Church, and of divided regionalism. The Granadine Confederation was established by the Constitution of 1853, considered pro-federalist or centro-federalist because it gave more autonomy to the provinces, which multiplied to 35 provinces during the administration of Manuel María Mallarino (1855–1857), each with its own provincial constitution.http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/revistas/credencial/agosto1994/agosto1.htm Federalism in the 9 sovereign states ===States=== Granadine Confederation during 1858. After the disestablishment of Gran Colombia, the centralized government of the Republic of New Granada which was ratified by the constitution of 1843, was soon challenged by the independentist feelings of the different regions; particularly the provinces of Azuero, Chiriquí, Panamá, and Veraguas, which were demanding autonomous status. The Constitution of 1853 permitted this so that on February 27, 1855, the State of Panamá could be created within the Republic of New Granada. Soon others followed, regionalism was too strong, and in order to prevent a division like the one Greater Colombia had, with Venezuela and Ecuador quitting the union, congress allowed the creation of other sovereign states: * Federal State of Antioquia was created from Antioquia Province on June 11, 1856. * Federal State of Santander, which included the provinces of Socorro and Pamplona, was created May 13, 1857. Law of the Creation of the State of Santander The Law of June 15, 1857 created the other states that would later form parts of the Confederation Granadine: * Federal State of Bolívar (Estado Federal de Bolívar), which included Cartagena Province. * Federal State of Boyacá (Estado Federal de Boyacá), which included the provinces of Tunja, Tundama, Casanare, and the cantons of Chiquinquirá and Vélez. * Federal State of Cauca (Estado Federal de Cauca), which included the provinces of Buenaventura, Chocó, Pasto and Popayán and the region of Caquetá. * Federal State of Cundinamarca (Estado Federal de Cundinamarca), which included the province of Mariquita, Bogotá, Neiva, Provinces of The Sovereign State of Cundinamarca and Tolima. * Federal State of Magdalena (Estado Federal de Magdalena), which included the provinces of El Banco, Padilla, Santa Marta, Tenerife and Valledupar. The nation was formed by the union of these Sovereign States which were confederated in perpetuity to form a Sovereign Nation, free and independent with the name “Confederation Granadine\\". During 1858 the new constituency, with its majority of conservatives, convened and signed the Constitution for the Confederation Granadine of 1858, Constitution for the Granadine Confederation of 1858 confirming Bogotá as its Federal Capital. On July 12, 1861, after fighting the constitutional government of the president Mariano Ospina Rodríguez, the general Tomas Cipriano de Mosquera created the Sovereign State of Tolima, created out of the State of Cundinamarca. This was confirmed and legalized by the rest of the states of the Colombian Union, by means of Article 41 of the Pact of the Union on September 20, 1861, reaffirming the legality of the institutionalism of Tolima. Tolima, Creation and Institutional Growth ===Constitution of 1858=== By the conservative mandate of Mariano Ospina Rodríguez, Congress passed and approved a new Constitution for the country on May 22, 1858. Constitution of 1858 By this constitution, the country was named officially as the Confederation Granadine and conformed by eight sovereign states. More power and representation was given to the provinces, as each state could have its own legislature and elect its own president. The vice presidency was abolished and replaced with a dignitary named by the Congress. The president and senators could be elected to serve a period of four years and the Representatives of the House for two. The Constitution also listed the powers and obligations of the states and of the central government, and gave parameters to creating new laws and amending the constitution. It included the basic freedoms, and rights of the people. The constitution was important as it signaled the official beginning of the confederacy and set legal parameters. ===Civil war=== President of the Granadine Confederation Mariano Ospina Rodríguez Even though the Constitution of 1858 had legalized federalism, the politics of the president Mariano Ospina Rodríguez favored centralism. This conservativism clashed with the wishes of the states which wanted more power and autonomy. This caused some leaders to consider the administrative base of the federation as a notion to underestimate the authority of the states, and led the national government to view the independent aspirations of the states as a threat to the overall nation. The political tension came to its pinnacle in 1859 when Congress passed two controversial laws. On April 8, 1859, Congress passed a law giving the President the right to remove the duly appointed governors of the states and appoint one of his choosing. With this law, the president secured the power of the Conservative Party. On May 10, 1859, another law was passed, this one giving the president the power to create administrative departments in states so to control their resources and how would they be used. These laws angered many liberal leaders, specially general Tomás Cipriano de Mosquera, an ex-president of New Granada, and a powerful and influential politician in the country. He denounced these laws as unconstitutional and made contact with other liberal leaders in other states, who gave him their support to revolt against the president, even though not all agreed with his ideas, they supported him and accepted to allow him to become Supreme Director of War, because they saw no other way to get back their autonomy than to revolt against the government. By a decree of May 8, 1860, Mosquera broke relations with the national government, declared himself Supreme Director of War, and declared a separated state, the Sovereign State of Cauca. From that moment the country entered a civil war. In retaliation, the government of Ospina Rodríguez endorsed insurrections against the liberal governments in some states, the first of these armed conflicts being in Santander, against the government of Eustorgio Salgar during 1859; the Confederacy Granadine declared war on the state of Santander, and sent its army to subdue Eustogio Salgar, who was captured along with other important figures, including Aquileo Parra. Civil war then spread to other states, including Bolívar, Antioquía, Magdalena and Cauca. In an unexpected act, Mosquera captured Bogotá on June 18, 1861, declared himself president of the provisional government, and arrested Ospina Rodríguez, his brother Pastor Ospina, and Bartolomé Calvo, the newly elected president of the confederacy. The war ended in 1862 when the last leaders of the conservative opposition died or gave up. ==GeographyBorders=== According to the constitution of 1858, the limits of the territory of the Granadine Confederation were to be the same as those of 1810, that divided the territory of the Viceroyalty of New Granada from the Captaincy General of Venezuela, the Captaincy General of Guatemala, and the Portuguese possessions in Brazil. In the west, the limits would be those marked provisionally by the treaty with the government of Ecuador on July 9, 1856, and all treaties with that republic. ===Regions=== The Granadine Confederation covered a vast region, sharply divided by its geography. The country was divided by the three cordilleras of the Andes mountains, the Magdalena River which was the main artery of navigation in the country, and the Isthmus of Panama which was isolated in its own region. The jungles in the south only added to the confusion. The unclear borders were never definitively marked, and the terrain secluded its residents, mostly natives, from the rest of the country. Four isolated regions divided the country; the Oriental Region included Cundinamarca, Tolima, Boyacá and Santander; the Cauca Region, which included Chocó and extended to Marmato; the Region of Antioquía, that extended down to the River Chinchiná near Manizales; and the Atlantic Region. Four Isolated Regions Each of these regions behaved like a separate country without relations to the others. This isolation and lack of roads was a severe restraint on the economy, as its already distant nuclei were too far from each other for trade to grow and investment to take place. ==Religion== During the brief life of the Confederacy Granadine, the Roman Catholic Church was a constant target for the government. Although its population was still very Roman Catholic, and religion formed an essential part of life, the government approved a number of laws directed at controlling the clergy and church property during this time. During the first presidency of general Tomás Cipriano de Mosquera during 1849, Mosquera adopted a radical position with the church, approving laws confiscating religious property and subjecting the clergy to government rules. He banished the Society of Jesus from the Republic of New Granada, expelled the Archbishop of Bogotá. The closure of convents and monasteries drove nuns into poverty, although many were taken into homes by citizens. All of this drew direct criticism from the Vatican, even causing Pope Pius IX to condemn the government of Colombia for its actions. After the creation of the Confederation Granadine, during the government of Mariano Ospina Rodríguez, the Jesuits were once again welcomed into the country and religious tensions eased. This brief period of religious calm ended when Mosquera, who assumed the presidency a second time, continued with his anticlerical attitude driving once again the Jesuits out of the Confederacy giving them only seventy-two hours to leave the country or risk imprisonment, as he blamed them of endorsing the insurgency.Jesuitas  documentos  Encuentros con la Palabra He passed a couple of anticlerical laws. One of these was the Tuition of Cults, a law that prohibited religious officials to exercise their functions without authorization from the government, thus requiring special licenses to preach.:: Presidencia de la República de Colombia :: Through another law, he confiscated the property of religious communities and organizations such as schools, hospitals, monasteries, churches, land, houses and other properties that could be sold. Those organizations that opposed were banned and abolished. These laws were not approved as a direct attack on the Church, but what was pretended was to improve the situation of the national treasury which was depleted because of the Civil War currently being waged. The Church assets were sold to the best buyer, improving industry and investment while putting money in the hands of the state. However the laws provided little assistance to the farmers who finished up owning little of the land as Mosquera intended, with his slogan of “Land for those who work it”. Political Constitution for the United States of Colombia. 1863. ==Rionegro Convention== The Granadine Confederation ended on 8 May 1863, with the signing of the Constitution of 1863 by the Rionegro Convention, which officially changed the name of the country to the United States of Colombia, consisting of nine sovereign states, and where new rules and powers were given to the states and presidents. The Liberals had come to fear the great power of Mosquera, and they drafted the new constitution to limit his power. The Radical Liberals defended a federal government based on a laissez-faire policy, in which regional and local autonomy were protected, where there was no national army, a society with basic rights and freedoms, based on education and open market values, with no intervention by the church.

He was the founder of the Royal Wiltshire Yeomanry. ==Family== On 28 March 1786, he married Florentina Wrey, third daughter of Sir Bourchier Wrey, 6th Baronet, and had by her four daughters and two sons. After a lingering illness Long died aged 73, at Rood Ashton House, six weeks after his wife, and was interred in the family's crypt at St Mary's Church, Steeple Ashton. His older son Walter was also a member of parliament, representing North Wiltshire. His second daughter Florentina (Flora), having been previously engaged to Henry Cobbe (uncle of Frances Power Cobbe), who had died the day before the proposed marriage, formed a strong attachment to the then-elderly poet George Crabbe. Flora and her aunts were frequent visitors of novelist Jane Austen, who referred to Flora as her 'cousin', though their exact relationship is not known. Austen never met Crabbe, but nursed a fantasy of becoming his wife. ==Further reading== * Inheriting the Earth: The Long Family's 500 Year Reign in Wiltshire; Cheryl Nicol ==Notes== ==References== * ==External links== * Category:1761 births Category:1835 deaths Category:High Sheriffs of Wiltshire Richard Godolphin Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for Wiltshire Category:Tory MPs (pre-1834) Category:UK MPs 1806–1807 Category:UK MPs 1807–1812 Category:UK MPs 1812–1818 Category:Royal Wiltshire Yeomanry officers ","title":"Richard Godolphin Long"},{"id":"9076649","text":"Eusebia del Rosario Ortiz Yeladaqui is a Mexican politician from Quintana Roo, affiliated with the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), who serves in the cabinet of Governor Félix González Canto. ==Political career== Ortiz Yeladaqui is a PRI member from Quintana Roo who has occupied different positions both inside her party and in the Quintana Roo public service.

It was the first home ground of football club Thames Ironworks, the works team of the Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company. The club would later be reformed as West Ham United. The ground was used by Old St Luke's from 1892 and continued to be used after the club merged with Castle Swifts to become Old Castle Swifts, the first professional football club in Essex, for the 1894–95 season. Thames Ironworks took over the tenancy of the ground from Old Castle Swifts in the summer of 1895 after the club was wound up. Future manager Syd King later described Hermit Road as a \\"cinder heap\\" and \\"barren waste\\". The ground employed a system of drainage sluices, which gave the look of it being surrounded by a moat. Canvas sheeting was originally used for fencing, to prevent non-paying spectators from seeing the games. This was later replaced. Thames Ironworks played their first ever fixture of the 1895–96 season against Royal Ordnance reserves on 7 September 1895, the game ending 1–1. In Thames' first competitive game, they took on Chatham in a preliminary qualifying round of the FA Cup. The match had to be played at Chatham's ground in Kent as they had rated the Irons' Hermit Road Ground as unsuitable. Thames lost the game 5–0. The ground was host to some of the first experiments with artificial lighting. Following a number of trials against local sides, 16 March 1896 saw a 'floodlit friendly' in Thames' first encounter with Woolwich Arsenal, in an epic encounter that they lost 3–5. These early attempts at floodlighting were set up using Thames Iron Works engineers and equipment, and caused an amount of notoriety. They were also used for the Irons' next game, in their first ever meeting with West Bromwich Albion, which they lost 2–4. The 1896–97 season saw Thames Ironworks beat the Vampires 3-0 in their first ever London League fixture on 19 September 1896. Thames Ironworks' next game at Hermit Road would also be their last. It came on 8 October, when they beat 1st Scots Guards 1–0. Later that month they were handed an eviction notice from Hermit Road by their landlords. The club had violated their tenancy agreement by charging admission fees and building a perimeter fence and pavilion. Thames Ironworks had to play their next four fixtures at the grounds of their opponents, until a new home could be found. At the turn of 1897, Thames' chairman Arnold Hills had managed to lease a temporary piece of land for the team, located in Browning Road, East Ham. ==Notes== ==References== ==Bibliography== * Category:West Ham United F.C.

It starts near the end of Oda Nobunaga's reign, with Rikyū serving as tea master to Nobunaga, and continues into the Momoyama Period. Rikyū is portrayed as a man thoroughly dedicated to aesthetics and perfection, especially in relation to the art of tea. While serving as tea master to the new ruler Toyotomi Hideyoshi, Rikyū finds himself in a uniquely privileged position, with constant access to the powerful feudal lord and the theoretical ability to influence policy, yet he studiously avoids deep involvement in politics while attempting to focus his full attention to the study and teachings of the way of tea. To the extent that he expresses himself, he does so diplomatically, in a way to avoid disrupting the harmony of his relationship with Hideyoshi. Yet, as society is changed violently and radically around him, also finding himself the focus of jealousy and misdirected suspicions, Rikyū ultimately can not avoid confronting larger social issues. He is compelled to express an opinion on Hideyoshi's military plans. This one breach of his studied isolation from world affairs leads quickly to tragic consequences. == Background == Director Teshigahara, himself a master and teacher of the Japanese traditional art of ikebana, brings the viewer into appreciation and deep sympathy for Rikyu's aesthetic idealism and his careful diplomatic efforts to avoid excessive entanglement in political affairs. The film itself is very studied in its aestheticism, and very expressive of the shocking force of life intruding into the guarded hermetic space of the artist/idealist. ==Cast== *Rentarō Mikuni as Sen no Rikyū *Tsutomu Yamazaki as Toyotomi Hideyoshi *Yoshiko Mita as Riki *Matsumoto Kōshirō IX as Oda Nobunaga *Nakamura Kichiemon II as Tokugawa Ieyasu *Ryō Tamura as Toyotomi Hidenaga *Kyōko Kishida as Nene *Tanie Kitabayashi as Ōmandokoro *Sayoko Yamaguchi as Cha-cha *Bandō Mitsugorō X as Ishida Mitsunari *Hisashi Igawa as Yamanoue Sōji *Donald Richie as Gaspar Coelho *Kyoko Enami as Chika ==Awards== Rentarō Mikuni won the Best Actor Award of the Japanese Academy for his roles in this film and Tsuribaka Nisshi of the same year.

His debut was City Slang, 1981. ==Life== Søren Ulrik Thomsen was born in 1956 in Kalundborg. He grew up in Store Heddinge, Stevns, south of Copenhagen, where he went to school together with another Danish poet, Jens Fink-Jensen from 1968 to 1972. During his childhood he often heard readings of literature and sang evening songs. This early exposure to the rhythm and poetry of language influenced his later writing. In school he became familiar with the songs of B.S.Ingemann, a poet who has had significant influence on Thomsen's poetry. He moved with his family to Copenhagen at sixteen and enrolled in secondary school at Rysensteen and, after being expelled, at Det Frie Gymnasium, where he completed his upper secondary education, making him eligible for university studies. His encounter with Copenhagen influenced his early poetry, and was reflected in themes such as the strangeness and loneliness of the big city. Søren Ulrik Thomsen studied comparative literature at the University of Copenhagen, but prioritized writing poetry rather than completing his degree. His debut was in the review Hvedekorn (Wheatgrain) in 1977.Søren Ulrik Thomsen: En Dans på Gloser; \\"Vejen mellem to Skoler\\" ==Publishing and style== His first collection of poetry was City Slang (1981; this and other links to years are to the corresponding \\"[year]-in-poetry\\" articles). It is poetry about human alienation in a city. In 1984, the Danish singer Lars H.U.G. scored these poems on an album of the same title, expanding Thomsen's audience. Thomsen's collections of poetry City Slang, Ukendt under den samme måne (\\"Unknown Under the Same Moon\\"; 1982) and New poems (1987) belonged to the group of 80s poets who were reacting against the political poets of the seventies. The 80s poets, which included Michael Strunge, was focused on the body, sensations, and existential subjects in a tight, minimalistic language. Later Thomsen published Hjemfalden (1991), Det skabtes vaklen (\\"The Shaking of Creation\\",\\"\\" , blog post, March 6, 2009, \\"CLA blog\\" (\\"College of Liberal Arts\\"), University of Minnesota website, retrieved January 1, 2009 1996) and Det værste og det bedste, illustrated by Ib Spang Olsen, (2002). With these collections he moved away from the school 80s poets and establishes himself as a poet with a truly individual expression. Søren Ulrik Thomsen is interested in great existential human conditions such as death and loneliness, creation and destruction. His poems in Hjemfalden are rhythmic arabesques, which comes through strongly in his public readings. He has also published two poetics, where he tries to define the essence of poetry and what happens in the process of creating a poem, Mit lys brænder. Omrids af en ny poetik (\\"In My Candle Burns: Outline of a New Poetics\\", 1985) and En dans på gloser, essays (\\"Dancing Attendance on the Word,\\" 1996). As a writer Søren Ulrik Thomsen also participates in public debate and has published a book of essays with Frederik Stjernfeldt, Kritik af den negative opbyggelighed. His books have always enjoyed a great deal of attention as the subject of numerous books and essays, and he is seen as one of the more significant Danish contemporary poets. He was the focus of the only conference (as of 2009) ever devoted to a living Danish writer. Søren Ulrik Thomsen's poetry has been translated in the book Selected Poetry, based on poems from Hjemfalden and Det skabtes vaklen.Søren Ulrik Thomsen: Selected Poems. Translated by Susanna Nied.

Until the conversion of medium-wave transmission frequencies to by nine divisible kilohertz values according to the wave plan of Geneva wave in 1978, its transmission frequency was 593 kHz. Until 1994 the transmitting power was 400 kW. In 1994, it was reduced to 300 kW. Weiskirchen transmitter has a directional antenna, which consists of two 126.5-metre-tall guyed lattice steel mast radiators (coordinates: and ) insulated against ground. In opposite to other guyed masts used for medium wave transmission, its guys are not partitioned with insulators. Instead they are grounded over coils situated directly close to the anchor block, which are so tuned, that high frequency currents in the guys are as low as possible. One avoids by this guy construction expansive maintenance work at surge arresters at insulators partitioning the guys. The Weiskirchen transmitter forms together with Hoher Meissner transmitter a single frequency network. The directive pattern of the transmitter has a maximum toward northwest and two minima pointing toward northeast and southeast. By regulation of the feeding power for each mast, the directivity pattern can be changed, in cooperation with Hoher Meissner transmitter the maximum even to the east. ==Operation== The program is transmitted by cable from the studio in Frankfurt to Weiskirchen transmitter. The transmitter uses two water-cooled final stages, which are switched in parallel, in order to avoid a complete transmitter failure in case of a failure of a single tube. The power supply takes place under normal conditions from the local electricity 20kV grid. For the case of power failure there is a Diesel generator, which starts in a period of 10 to 20 seconds. The current for starting the generator is supplied by a small accumulator unit, which is connected automatically at power failure. If the Diesel generator is used as power source, transmission power is reduced to 100 kW. == Program Supply == First the transmitter combination Weiskirchen and Hoher Meissner supplied without frequency shift mobile receivers as car radios with the first program of the Hessian Broadcasting Company. Until the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe in 1989 this program was predominantly radiated due to the large range of mediumwaves in the night hours by change of the directivity patterns of both transmitters towards east. Today the broadcast program is mainly the news program HR info. Between 19-22 o'clock programmes for foreign workers are transmitted. It is also used for the transmission of debates of the Bundestag and the Hessian federal state parliament or for other special life reports as live reports from soccer matches.

They are deadly to all living creatures. They are extremely resilient, resistant to high temperatures, do not need shelter and are able to survive an apocalypse without taking cover. Dalphins in this novel resemble real dolphins. They have evolved to survive an apocalypse in the following way: females lay eggs once every twenty years, right before the apocalypse. Critical changes in the environment, and sometimes just the warning signs, stimulate development of the larvae. The creatures migrate back to the ocean when seismic activity is over. The next stage of their development is the cocoon. A Dalphin spends one to two months inside the cocoon before emerging as an adult. In the world of this book, mentioning of the glaives is a taboo, probably from the fear of them. The word glaive means an edged weapon that was used in the medieval times. * \\"The Yellowmore\\" () (from the book Bastard) is a wizard's trap. It looks like an old man carved out of a tree. This old man smokes a pipe that emits yellow smoke. Smoke kills living things, by homing on the body heat. * \\"The Devourer\\" () (from the book Bastard) is a wizard's trap. It is a hole in the ground that attracts its victims with a children's cry for help. Approaching victim gets sucked in by a whirlwind. * \\"Calidons\\" () (from the book The Ritual) are gigantic white birds, which live near the dragons. They pluck their own soft white feathers in order to hatch their chicks. * \\"Mryga\\" () (from the book Armaggedon-Home) is an apocalypse, that comes periodically, approximately every twenty years. During this period \\"The gates\\" are formed: objects of the unknown nature, that look like a stone arch with a mirror inside. People who enter the mirror are safe from the apocalypse and are able to return after it is over. \\"Minor gates\\" are formed as well, these are used by the animals and can not be employed by humans. There are enough gates formed, so every person has an opportunity to be saved if he/she enters the nearest one. These gates are transmitting some kind of signal, but humans were not able to determine what it is. * \\"Nav\\", \\"Navka\\", \\"Nyavka\\" () (from the book Age of the Witch) is a magic creature that takes its form after a person who has recently died. It is brought to life if someone loved that dead person and wished for him/her to come back. Nav is using deception to kill a person who brought it to life. Nav, as well as Chugaister, are taken from Ukrainian mythology, but differ from the source material in many ways. For example: in the classic Ukrainian novel The Forest Song () by Lesya Ukrainka, the main characte is a Navka, a spirit of the forest or sprite. * \\"Chugaister\\" () (from the book Age of the Witch, probably taken from a book \\"The Forest Song\\" by Lesya Ukrainka ) are magical creatures that are very similar to the human. Chugaisters, sometimes by themselves, sometimes in a group, destroy Navs (see above), by dancing around them. By doing so they make Navs to dance with them until they collapse dead. Chugaister was taken from the Ukrainian mythology, but is somewhat different from the original creature. * \\"Elfoush\\" () (from the book The Well Master) is a little flying somewhat intelligent creature, which resembles an elf. Little children and people who are in love can understand what elfoushes say, thus becoming their prey. * \\"Housekeeper\\" () (from the book The Well Master) is a little house demon, looks like a little man with spider's legs. == Notes and references == ==References== * Writers' official international website * official website of the authors at www.rusf.ru * official website of the authors at www.fiction.ru * official website of the authors at sf.org.kemsu.ru * Bibliography * lib.ru Available books in the On- line Library of Moshkov * Vita Nostra on Amazon * The story behind the cover of Vita Nostra ==External links== * Marina and Sergey Dyachenko - biography * , Paweł Laudański, Marina i Siergiej Diaczenko, Esensja, 9 July 2003 * , Paweł Laudański, Wywiad z Mariną i Siergiejem Diaczenko, Esensja, 9 February 2005 Category:Ukrainian science fiction writers Category:Ukrainian fantasy writers Category:Ukrainian alternate history writers Category:Russian-language writers Category:Living people Category:Married couples Category:Women science fiction and fantasy writers Category:Russian women writers Category:Writing duos Category:Women historical novelists Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Maryna and Serhiy Dyachenko"},{"id":"9077139","text":"Rajashekhara (; ) was an eminent Sanskrit poet, dramatist and critic.

As the mission statement states \\"The mission of JANIP is to bring together scholars, teachers, and administrators who reject the increasingly polarized debate surrounding the Palestinian–Israeli conflict. Our goal is to bring a voice into the conversation – out of our identification with and commitment to Israel – that supports a negotiated two-state solution, an end to occupation, and Israel’s withdrawal from Gaza and bilaterally agreed-upon settlements in the West Bank. Specifically, we believe in: * The right of both peoples to self-determination within recognized, secure borders * The concept of civil society in which conflicts are resolved without violence; terrorism or other extra-legal activities to which both the Palestinians and the Israelis are held strictly accountable * Direct negotiations and mutual accommodation as the route to a true and enduring peace between the two societies. Many, if not all, campus-based debates dealing with the Palestinian-Israeli conflict have been reduced to a simplified choice: either uncompromisingly pro-Israel or pro-Palestinian, with little or no consideration of the competing rightful claims of the other side. As a result, more critical perspectives and dialogue have become virtually impossible. We believe that it is our responsibility as scholars and teachers to inject a voice of realism and moderation back into the public debate through public statements, op-ed articles, position papers, conferences, and other activities and to support other academics, students and members of the community who share these views.\\" JANIP sponsored two Pathways to Peace international academic conference on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. == References == * Meretz USA * JANIP * Ameinu, Labor Zionist Alliance * Pathways to Peace Conference Category:Non-governmental organizations involved in the Israeli–Palestinian peace process ","title":"JANIP"},{"id":"9077171","text":"Cannon Falls Area Schools is a public school district located in Cannon Falls, Minnesota.

Although it is primarily for LCDs, the legibility on cathode ray tube (CRT) monitors is also improved. The main reason why Adobe built their own sub-pixel renderer is so they could display documents the same way across various operating systems: Windows, MacOS, Linux, etc. When it was launched, CoolType supported a wider range of fonts than Microsoft's ClearType, which was then limited to TrueType fonts, whereas Adobe's CoolType also supported PostScript fonts (and their OpenType equivalent as well). CoolType is also available in non-Adobe applications through the commercially licensed Adobe PDF Library. As with ClearType, Quartz and FreeType, CoolType uses subpixel rendering to effectively triple the usual horizontal resolution of the screen. This makes the text sharper, but the colors might be slightly incorrect at the edges. However, the human eye is better at detecting variations in intensity than in color, and these discrepancies are not usually noticeable. CoolType also obsoleted the Adobe Type Manager (ATM). Because the font selection menus that CoolType provides display fewer details than ATM, there were some initial problems in editing TeX PostScript output in Adobe applications that used CoolType. ==Footnotes== ==See also== * Subpixel rendering * Font rasterization ==External links== * More information about Adobe CoolType Category:Digital typography Category:2000 software Category:Adobe software ","title":"CoolType"},{"id":"9077185","text":"The mesohyl, formerly known as mesenchyme or as mesoglea, is the gelatinous matrix within a sponge. It fills the space between the external pinacoderm and the internal choanoderm. The mesohyl resembles a type of connective tissue and contains several amoeboid cells such as amebocytes, as well as fibrils and skeletal elements. For a long time, it has been largely accepted that sponges lack true tissue, but it is currently debated as to whether mesohyl and pinacoderm layers are tissues. The mesohyl is composed of the following main elements: collagen, fibronectin-like molecules, galectin, and a minor component, dermatopontin. These polypeptides form the extracellular matrix which provides the platform for specific cell adhesion as well as for signal transduction and cellular growth.

Until 20 June 2014 King was also a non-executive director of Rotork plc, an engineering company. ==Career== BAE Systems was created by a merger of Marconi Electronic Systems and British Aerospace.

When BAE Systems was created in November 1999, King was named Group Strategy & Planning Director. In December 2000 King was appointed group managing director of BAE Systems Customer Solutions and Support. In November 2006, BAE Systems appointed King chief operating officer from 1 January 2007.

However, on 27 June 2008, BAE announced that it had selected King to succeed Turner with effect from 1 September 2008; The Financial Times noted that King's career at Marconi distances him from the British Aerospace-led Al Yamamah project.

Located on the westbank of the Daugava River (neighborhoods along this shore are collectively known as Pārdaugava). The name Torņakalns (eng.:Tower Hill) derives from a fortified tower built in the Middle Ages close to the Daugava River to alarm the city of Riga in case of emergency and unwelcomed intruders about to cross the river.Torņakalns page on citariga.lv (English version) The tower does not stand nowadays. ==Overview== Torņakalns was an early suburb to Riga, consisting largely of gardens and mansions. In contrast to the Soviet-built Zolitūde and Ziepniekkalns suburbs, there are plenty of gardens, parks, and monuments. Mārupes parks (eng.:Mary's Creek Park) encircles the Māras diķis (eng.:Mary's Pond), which was once dammed by a mill. The Mārupe (eng.:Mary's Creek) then continues into Arkādijas parks (eng.:Arcadian Park), where early 20th century landscaping provides an oasis from the city.Kadinsky, Sergey \\"Mārupīte, Riga: Part One\\" Hidden Waters Blog November 25, 2016 ==History== In 1940, the Soviet Union annexed Latvia and began mass deportations of Latvians who were deemed to be political and social threats to the new communist government. Because Torņakalns contained a number of affluent residents, these deportations took place at the Torņakalns railway station. Many of the mansions were confiscated, with some being divided into smaller units, and others turned to public use, including kindergartens and clinics. During World War II, the railway service between Riga and Torņakalns was suspended, following the destruction of the original railway trestle over the Daugava. Following the war, the neighborhood experienced an influx of non-Latvian Soviet citizens, reducing the ethnic Latvian percentage of the population. In the postwar development, the railway was electrified, streetcar service was expanded, factories and a military arsenal provided jobs in the neighborhood. Following the restoration of Latvian independence in 1991, many non-Latvians left the country, and Soviet-era street names were removed. A boxcar was installed at the Torņakalns station as a memorial to the Stalinist deportations. At the same time, a Soviet victory monument on the neighborhood's northern edge remained. Today, it remains a focal symbol for the city's Russian community. The main shopping venues for local residents include the Āgenskalns tirgus (eng.:Agenskalns Market) and Vienibas Gatve. In spite of initial economic uncertainty following independence, the neighborhood has since regained its status as a garden suburb within minutes of Old Riga. Most Torņakalns residents commute to the central business district by the electric railway, which contains a large station and railyard in the neighborhood. ==References== == Gallery == Latvijas Universitātes Akadēmiskais centrs.jpgThe new campus of the University of Latvia in Jelgavas iela Torņakalns.jpgTorņakalns, railway station RigaKonradaIela.jpgKonrāda street in Torņakalns Arkadijas parks - panoramio (4).jpgArkādija park Tornakalns Lutheran church - panoramio.jpgChurch of Luther in Torņakalns. ==External links== * Torņakalns official website Category:Neighbourhoods in Riga ","title":"Torņakalns"},{"id":"9077465","text":"Dawlat Yar is a district in Ghor Province, Afghanistan.

The event is a non-racing variant of banger racing. A banger rally may also be a charity rally where the teams taking part in the event also raise money for charity. Banger rallies chiefly appear to be a United Kingdom-based phenomenon and most involve driving through Europe to various destinations where the cars are environmentally scrapped, sold or auctioned for charity. Some events have a limit on how much a participant can spend on buying a car or the size of the engine. Participants in the events often decorate their vehicles with the stickers of sponsors or customising to a theme from popular culture. == The Rise of the Banger Rally == The banger rally first appeared when Julian Nowill took a group of sub £100 vehicles to Dakar over the Christmas and New Year of 2002/2003. The event was called the 'Plymouth Dakar' as a play on the name of the famous Paris Dakar rally. The event is now known as the Plymouth-Banjul Challenge. A variation of the Dakar appeared in 2003 in the form of Staples2Naples, Banger Rally for Wage Slaves.

The play is notable, even among Shirley's plays, for its lushness -- what one critic has called \\"gay romanticism run mad.\\"Nason, p. 245. ==History== The play was licensed for performance, under the title The Beauties, by Sir Henry Herbert, the Master of the Revels, on 21 January 1633. It was published in quarto in the same year, printed by B. Alsop and T. Fawcet for the bookseller William Cooke. The title page of the 1633 quarto states that the play was acted at the Phoenix, or Cockpit Theatre, which means it was played by Queen Henrietta's Men, as was standard for Shirley plays of that time. The play was ironically dedicated to William Prynne, the Puritan author and religious controversialist who published his wide-ranging attack on stage drama and actors, Histriomastix, in the previous year, 1632. Among other things, Histriomastix was perceived as an attack on Queen Henrietta Maria; Shirley's satirical dedication was seen as a defence of the Queen, and may have influenced the Inns of Court to select Shirley as the author of their masque, The Triumph of Peace, which was staged early in 1634. ==Women onstage== The Bird in a Cage also has some bearing on the question of women onstage. Women did not act on public stages prior to the Restoration; but aristocratic women did appear and dance in masques. And in January 1633, the Queen and her ladies had performed speaking parts in Walter Montagu's masque The Shepherd's Paradise. The Bird in a Cage includes a masque about Jupiter and Danaë, performed by Eugenia and her waiting women in their confinement.The masque scene is noteworthy for its treatment of lesbianism; Zimmerman, p. 162. (In the early productions, all the female roles were filled by boy actors.) This would have been another dig at Prynne, who was particularly incensed about sexuality and perceived immorality on the stage, in various aspects -- boys dressing as women, women appearing in masques, etc. ==Sources== Critics have noted the relationship between Shirley's play and a work in the canon of John Fletcher. \\"The Bird in a Cage involves extensive reworking of Fletcher's earlier play of wagers and incarceration, Women Pleased.\\"Chalmers, Sanders, Tomlinson, p. 7. ==Synopsis== The Duke of Mantua plans to marry off his daughter Eugenia to the ruler of Florence; to do so, he shuts Eugenia in a tower and banishes her noble suitor Philenzo. But Philenzo returns in disguise, and brags to the court that he can succeed in any task the Duke assigns him -- if the Duke grants him the financial resources necessary. The Duke (in the best fairy-tale tradition), sets Philenzo the task of gaining access to the princess Eugenia in her sequestered tower; the Duke considers the matter as something of a joke, but also a good opportunity to test the soundness of his security. Philenzo is allowed a month for the task, and a blank check on the Duke's treasure house. And of course, the penalty for failure is death. Philenzo tries bribes, which do not work. Facing the apparent failure of his effort, Philenzo decides that he can at least relieve the poor debtors in the Duke's dungeons. One of the debtors, however, provides Philenzo with a new strategy for reaching the princess. The Duke in presented with a large and elaborate cage full of rare birds; and the Duke sends the present to Eugenia. When she opens it, Philenzo steps out from concealment in the central pillar of the apparatus. Thus the title of the play applies to both Eugenia and Philenzo (as it does, in another sense, to the dedicatee, the imprisoned Prynne). The next day the still-disguised Philenzo informs the Duke that he has succeeded in his task. Eugenia, brought to the court for confirmation, supports Philenzo's claim -- and asks that she be allowed to marry the clever stranger. The Duke is outraged at her request; to marry a stranger of no birth is worse than marrying Philenzo. Philenzo doffs his disguise, revealing his true identity; but the unyielding Duke orders him executed. Seemingly in the knick of time, a letter arrives from the Duke of Florence, who has heard of the matter of Eugenia and Philenzo and renounces any interest in the arranged match. Florence's letter advises Mantua to let the young lovers marry, and Mantua decides to make the best of a bad bargain. When Philenzo in summoned back, however, it is learned that the condemned man poisoned himself on the way to execution; his corpse is brought in as proof. When the \\"dead\\" Philenzo overhears that he and Eugenia were to be allowed to marry, he returns to life. ==Notes== ==References== * Chalmers, Hero. Royalist Women Writers, 1650-1689\\\\.

This trend surprised some foreigners who thought of Egypt as a country that \\"embraced\\" foreigners \\"with suffocating affection\\" and preferred a \\"tolerant brand of Islam\\". Some scholars and authors have credited Islamist writer Sayyid QutbMurphy, Caryle Passion for Islam : Shaping the Modern Middle East: the Egyptian Experience, Scribner, 2002, p.57Kepel, Gilles, Muslim Extremism in Egypt by Gilles Kepel, English translation published by University of California Press, 1986, p. 74 as the inspiration for the new wave of attacks. Qutb, who had been executed in 1967 after another purported plot to assassinate of Abdel Nasser, was author of Ma'alim fi al-Tariq (Milestones), a manifesto for armed jihad in the advance of Islam to bring about \\"the kingdom of God on earth\\" and to eliminate \\"the kingdom of man\\",Qutbism: An Ideology of Islamic-Fascism by Dale C. Eikmeier. From Parameters, Spring 2007, pp. 85-98. sometimes referred to as Qutbism. His book has been called \\"one of the most influential works in Arabic of the last half century\\".The Age of Sacred Terror by Daniel Benjamin and Steven Simon, New York: Random House, c2002, p. 63 It became a best seller, went through many editions and strongly influenced Islamists in prison in Egypt. ==Military Technical College attack (1974)== On 18 April 1974, 100 members of the Islamic Liberation Organization (or Shabab Muhammad Group) stormed the armory of the Military Technical College in Cairo, seizing weapons and vehicles. Led by Salih SirriyaKepel, Gilles, Muslim Extremism in Egypt by Gilles Kepel, English translation published by University of California Press, 1986, p. 93 they hoped to kill President Anwar El Sadat and other top Egyptian officials — who were attending an official event nearby in the Arab Socialist Building — seize radio and television buildings (also nearby) and announce the birth of an Islamic State under the leadership of Hizb ut-Tahrir. 11 were killed and 27 wounded in the attempt as security forces were able to intercept conspirators before they left the academy. 95 ILO members are arrested and tried. 32 were convicted. Two were executed.Sageman, Marc, Understanding Terror Networks by Marc Sageman, University of Pennsylvania Press, 2004, p. 28 ==Takfir wal-Hijra (1977)== On 3 July 1977, a group known to the public as Takfir wal-Hijra (excommunication and exile), kidnapped former Egyptian government minister Muhammad al-Dhahabi. The group was led by a self-taught Islamic preacher Shukri Mustafa, and called themselves Jama'at al-Muslimin. Among their demands in exchange for al-Dhahabi's release were the release of 60 of Takfir wal- Hijra members from jail, public apologies from the press for negative stories about the group, the publication of a book by Mustafa, and 200,000 Egyptian pounds in cash.Sageman, Marc, Understanding Terror Networks by Marc Sageman, University of Pennsylvania Press, 2004, p.29 Instead of complying, the press publicized \\"a long list of offenses and crimes attributed to the group.\\"Kepel, Gilles, Muslim Extremism in Egypt by Gilles Kepel, English translation published by University of California Press, 1986, p. 70, 96 Four days after the kidnapping, al-Dhahabi's body was found. The murder provoked indignation among the Egyptian publicKepel, Gilles, Muslim Extremism in Egypt by Gilles Kepel, English translation published by University of California Press, 1986, p. 97 and extensive police raids led to the arrests of 410 of the group's members. ==Salvation from Hell (1980s)== Salvation from Hell sought to establish an Islamic state using force. The Egyptian government broke off ties with Iran following allegations that Iran funded the group. Yasser Al Borhamy was detained for a month in 1987 due to his alleged connection with the assassination attempt against interior minister Hassan Abu Basha. The group was also responsible for an assassination attempt on former interior minister Nabawi Ismail. ==Tanzim al-Jihad movement (1981)Targeting Christians=== In spring of 1981, Sheikh Omar Abdel-Rahman agreed to become the mufti of the shura (council) of underground Egyptian group Tanzim al-Jihad, the forerunner of Egyptian Islamic Jihad and al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya. He issued a fatwa sanctioning \\"the robbery and killing of Copts in furtherance of the jihad\\".Sageman, Marc, Understanding Terror Networks, Marc Sageman, University of Pennsylvania Press, 2004, p. 31 ===Sadat assassination and uprising=== By 1981 President Anwar Sadat had become unpopular among Egyptians and enraged Islamists by signing a peace treaty with Israel. On 6 October 1981, Sadat and six diplomats were assassinated while observing a military parade commemorating the eighth anniversary of the October 1973 War. Lieutenant Colonel Khalid Islambouli and two other members of the Tanzim al-Jihad movement fired machine guns and threw grenades into the reviewing stand. In conjunction with the assassination of Sadat, Tanzim al-Jihad began an insurrection in Asyut in Upper Egypt. Rebels took control of the city for a few days on 8 October 1981 before paratroopers from Cairo restored government control. 68 policemen and soldiers were killed in the fighting, but sentences of arrested militants were relatively light, with most of them serving only three years in prison.Sageman, Marc, Understanding Terror Networks by Marc Sageman, University of Pennsylvania Press, 2004, pp. 33,4 ==Attacks on Israelis (1985-2006)== The Ras Burqa massacre was a shooting attack in October 1985 on Israeli vacationers in Ras Burqa, a beach resort area in the Sinai peninsula, in which seven Israelis were killed, including four children. Egypt refused to allow the victims to be treated by Israeli doctors or transferred to hospitals in Israel. On 4 February 1990, a bus carrying tourists in Egypt was attacked by members of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Eleven people were killed, including nine Israelis, and 17 wounded (sixteen of whom Israelis). This was the fourth attack on Israeli tourists in Egypt since the signing of the peace treaty. In November 1990 an Egyptian border guard crossed the border into Israel and opened fire with his AK-47 on vehicles on the Eilat-Kadesh Barnea road killing four people. Twelve of the people killed in the 2004 Sinai bombings were Israeli. The Sinai bus crash in August 2006, in which 11 Arab Israelis were killed, may have been premeditated. Families of the victims allege that evidence collected, including the driver's derogatory and threatening remarks attacking them for being Arabs and Israeli, indicate they were targeted by a cell. ==Attacks during the 1990s== Terrorism deaths in Egypt The violent Islamic insurgency during the 1990s targeted police and government officials but also civilians including tourists. Al-Gama'a al- Islamiyya was the primary perpetrator of the attacks, but Egyptian Islamic Jihad also was involved. ===Rifaat el-Mahgoub assassination=== In October 1990, Egyptian Islamic Jihad attempted to assassinate Egyptian Interior Minister Abdel Halim Moussa, but ended up killing parliamentary Speaker Rifaat el-Mahgoub.Sageman, Marc, Understanding Terror Networks by Marc Sageman, University of Pennsylvania Press, 2004, p. 33 ===Daylight ambushes=== 1993 was a particularly severe year for terrorist attacks in Egypt. 1106 persons were killed or wounded. More police (120) than terrorists (111) were killed that year and \\"several senior police officials and their bodyguards were shot dead in daylight ambushes.\\"Murphy, Caryle Passion for Islam : Shaping the Modern Middle East: the Egyptian Experience, Scribner, 2002, pp. 82-3 === Cairo attacks === On 18 April 1996, gunmen opened fire on Greek tourists who were about to board a bus outside Cairo's Europa Hotel, near the pyramids. Seventeen Greeks and an Egyptian were killed, and 15 Greeks and an Egyptian were wounded. On 18 September 1997, gunmen attacked tourist buses parked outside the Egyptian Museum in Tahrir Square, killing nine tourists, including seven Germans, and wounding 19. ===Luxor massacre=== Djeser-DjeseruThe Luxor Massacre took place on 17 November 1997, at Deir el-Bahri, an archaeological site and tourist destination located across the River Nile from Luxor, Egypt. In the mid-morning attack, Islamic terrorists from Al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya (\\"The Islamic Group\\") and Talaa'al al-Fateh (Vanguards of Conquest), both of which are suspected of having ties to al-Qaeda massacred 62 tourists at the attraction. The six assailants, armed with automatic firearms and knives, were disguised as members of the security forces. They descended on the Temple of Hatshepsut at around 08:45 and massacred 62 people, their modus operandi including beheadings and disembowellings. The attackers then hijacked a bus, but armed Egyptian tourist police and military forces arrived soon afterwards and engaged in a gun battle with the six terrorists, who were later killed or committed suicide. ==Attacks during the 2000s2004 Sinai bombing=== The 2004 Sinai bombings were three bomb attacks targeting tourist hotels in the Sinai Peninsula, Egypt, on 7 October 2004. The attacks killed 34 people and injured 171. The explosions occurred in the Hilton Taba in Taba and campsites used by Israelis in Ras al-Shitan. In the Taba attack, a truck drove into the lobby of the Taba Hilton and exploded, killing 31 people and wounding some 159 others. Ten floors of the hotel collapsed following the blast. Some south, at campsites at Ras al-Shitan, near Nuweiba, two more bombings happened. A car parked in front of a restaurant at the Moon Island resort exploded, killing three Israelis and a Bedouin. Twelve were wounded. Another blast happened moments later, targeting the Baddiyah camp, but did not harm anyone because the bomber had apparently been scared off from entering the campground by a guard. Of the dead, many were foreigners: 12 were from Israel, two from Italy, one from Russia, and one was an Israeli-American. The rest of the dead were believed to be Egyptian. According to the Egyptian government, the bombers were Palestinians who had tried to enter Israel to carry out attacks there but were unsuccessful. The mastermind, Iyad Saleh, recruited Egyptians and Bedouins to gain explosives to be used in the attacks. ===April 2005 attacks=== The April 2005 attacks in Cairo were three related incidents that took place in Cairo on 7 April and 30 April 2005. Two incidents caused no loss of life other than those of the perpetrators and appear not to have been planned in advance; in the first attack, however, three bystanders were killed. Two groups claimed responsibility - the Mujahedeen of Egypt and the Abdullah Azzam Brigades. In its statement, the latter group said the attacks were in retaliation for the government's clampdown on dissidents in the wake of the Sinai Peninsula bombings. In the early hours of 1 May, security forces arrested some 225 individuals for questioning, mostly from the dead three's home villages and from the area where they lived in Shubra. Particularly keenly sought was Muhammad Yassin, the teenage brother of Ehab Yousri Yassin, whom the police described as the only remaining suspect in the bazaar bomb attack and a material witness to the shooting. Over the course of the weekend, it also emerged that all the attackers were relatives of Ashraf Said, a suspect in the 7 April bombing who was taken in for questioning and died in police custody on 29 April. ===2005 Sharm el-Sheikh attacks=== Sharm el-Sheikh is located on the coast of the Red Sea, at the southern tip of the Sinai Peninsula.The 2005 Sharm el-Sheikh attacks were a series of bomb attacks on 23 July 2005, targeting the Egyptian resort city of Sharm el-Sheikh, located on the southern tip of the Sinai Peninsula. 88 people were killed and over 150 were wounded by the blasts. The bombing coincided with Egypt's Revolution Day, which commemorates Nasser's 1952 overthrow of King Farouk. The attacks took place in the early morning hours, at a time when many tourists and locals were still out at restaurants, cafés and bars. The first bomb blast, at 01:15 local time (22:15 UTC), was reported in a market in downtown Sharm; shortly after, another was reported to have hit the Ghazala Gardens hotel in the Naama Bay area, a strip of beachfront hotels some 6 km from the town centre. While the official government toll a few days after the blast was 64, hospitals reported that 88 people had been killed in the bombings. The majority of dead and wounded casualties were Egyptians. Among those killed were 11 Britons, two Germans, one Czech, six Italians, one Israeli, and one American. Other casualties, dead and wounded, included foreign visitors from France, Kuwait, the Netherlands, Qatar, Russia, and Spain. A group calling itself the Abdullah Azzam Brigades (a reference to militant Islamist ideologue Abdullah Yusuf Azzam) was the first to claim responsibility for the attacks. On a website the group stated that \\"holy warriors targeted the Ghazala Gardens hotel and the Old Market in Sharm el-Sheikh\\" and claimed it has ties to Al-Qaeda. Additional claims were later made by two other groups calling themselves the \\"Tawhid and Jihad Group in Egypt\\" and \\"Holy Warriors of Egypt\\". ===2006 Dahab bombings=== The seaside town of Dahab is located on the Gulf of AqabaThe Dahab bombings of 24 April 2006 were three bomb attacks on the Egyptian resort city of Dahab. The resorts are popular with Western tourists and Egyptians alike during the holiday season. At about 19:15 local time on 24 April 2006 -- a public holiday in celebration of Sham Al-Nasseim (Spring festival or Easter) -- a series of bombs exploded in tourist areas of Dahab, a resort located on the Gulf of Aqaba coast of the Sinai Peninsula. One blast occurred in or near the Nelson restaurant, one near the Aladdin café (both being on both sides of the bridge), and one near the Ghazala market. At least 23 people were killed, mostly Egyptians, but including a German, Lebanese, Russian, Swiss, and a Hungarian. Around 80 people were wounded, including tourists from Australia, Denmark, France, Germany, Israel, South Korea, Lebanon, the Palestinian Territories, United Kingdom, and the United States. The governor of South Sinai reported that the blasts might have been suicide attacks, but later Habib Adly, the interior minister of Egypt said that the devices were nail bombs set off by timers, and Egyptian TV also reported that the bombs were detonated remotely. Later investigations revealed the blasts were suicide attacks, set off by Bedouins, as in earlier attacks in the Sinai. These explosions followed other bombings elsewhere in the Sinai Peninsula in previous years: in Sharm el-Sheikh on 23 July 2005 and in Taba on 6 October 2004. Egyptian security officials have stated that the attacks were the work of an Islamic terror organisation called Jama'at al-Tawhīd wal-Jihad (Monotheism and Jihad). ===2008 Sudan kidnapping=== In September 2008, a group of eleven European tourists and eight Egyptians were kidnapped during an adventure safari to one of the remotest sites in Egypt deep in the Sahara desert and taken to Sudan. They were subsequently released unharmed. ===2009 Khan el-Khalili bombing and February 2009 Cairo terrorist attacks=== In February 2009, the Khan el-Khalili bombing killed a French schoolgirl on a class trip in Cairo. It is often discussed as the first of the February 2009 Cairo terrorist attacks. ===2009 Hezbollah plot=== In April 2009, Egypt said it had uncovered a Hezbollah plot to attack tourist sites in the Sinai, causing tension with the Shia group from Lebanon. ==Attacks since 2010Al-Qidiseen church bombing (2011)=== A car bomb explosion outside a church in the north Egyptian city of Alexandria killed at least 23 people and injured 43 following the evening service held at the church causing clashes between Coptic church members at the scene and the surrounding policemen. The attack saw governments around the world warn international travellers of the dangers of visiting the country, highlighting a likelihood of further terrorist attacks and possibility of kidnappings in Sinai. On 23 January 2011, the Egyptian minister of interior Habib El Adli stated that Ahmed Lotfi Ibrahim Mohammed confessed to monitoring Christian and Jewish places of worship and sending pictures of the Qideseen church in Alexandria to the Army of Islam. He had confessed visited Gaza several times and was involved in planning the attack. British intelligence revealed that Muhammad Abd al-Hadi, leader of Jundullah, recruited Abdul Rahman Ahmed Ali who was told to park the car, which would be exploded by remote control. ===Sinai insurgency (since 2011)=== The Sinai insurgency comprises a series of actions by Islamist militants in the Sinai peninsula, initiated in early 2011 as a fallout of the 2011 Egyptian Revolution. The actions of those Islamist elements, largely composed of tribesmen among the local Bedouins, drew a harsh response from interim Egyptian government since mid-2011 known as Operation Eagle. However, attacks against government and foreign facilities in the area continued into 2012, resulting in a massive crackdown by the new Egyptian government nicknamed Operation Sinai. In May 2013, following an abduction of Egyptian officers, violence in the Sinai surged once again. Following the 2013 Egyptian coup d'état, which resulted in the ousting of Mohamed Morsi, \\"unprecedented clashes\\" have occurred. ===2014 attack on border guards=== On 20 July 2014, at least 21 Egyptian soldiers were killed, and 4 injured in the Al-Wadi Al-Gedid attack when armed gunmen attacked a border checkpoint in the New Valley Governorate . ===Terrorism in Egypt since 2013 transition=== Since 2013 transition, more than 500 persons were killed in a new wave of terrorism. ===2015 downing of Metrojet Flight 9268=== On 31 October 2015 Metrojet Flight 9268 mysteriously dropped out of the sky over the Sinai Peninsula killing all 224 passengers on board. It was an international chartered passenger flight, operated by Russian airline Kogalymavia (branded as Metrojet), following departure from Sharm el-Sheikh International Airport, Egypt, en route to Pulkovo Airport, Saint Petersburg, Russia. The aircraft, an Airbus A321-231, was carrying mostly tourists, there were 219 Russian, four Ukrainian, and one Belarusian. With its death toll of 224 people, the crash of Flight 9268 is the deadliest both in the history of Russian aviation and within Egyptian territory. It is also the deadliest air crash involving an aircraft from the Airbus A320 family, and the deadliest plane crash of 2015. ISIL has now several times claimed responsibility for the incident, and authorities from several countries now agree that the most plausible scenarios is bomb smuggled on board at the airport. Pictures are circulating on the internet showing internally caused ruptures. Many countries race to upgrade airport security measures over fears that ISIL plans more such attacks. ===Church of Saints Peter & Paul bombing (2016)=== On 11 December 2016, an explosion occurred next to the Saint Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral complex in Cairo, at the Church of Saints Peter & Paul. The cathedral is the seat of the Coptic Orthodox Pope, in Cairo's Abbasia district. The explosion killed as many as 29 people, mostly women and children, and injured many more. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant claimed responsibility. President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi declared a national period of mourning for three days. ===Red Sea resort attacks (2016-17)=== On 8 January 2016, two suspected militants, armed with a melee weapon and a signal flare, allegedly arrived by sea and stormed the Bella Vista Hotel in the Red Sea city of Hurghada, stabbing two foreign tourists from Austria and one from Sweden. (Early reports incorrectly stated that the victims were one German and one Danish national.) One of the attackers, 21-year-old student Mohammed Hassan Mohammed Mahfouz, was killed by the security personnel. The other attacker was injured. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant claimed responsibility. On 14 July 2017 Abdel-Rahman Shaaban, a former university student from the Nile Delta region, swam from a public beach to each of two resort hotel beaches at Hurghada on the Red Sea and stabbed five German and one Czech tourists, all women, killing two German women. One Czech tourist is in clinical death as of July 26 and died day later in a hospital in Cairo. The perpetrator shouted that the Egyptian hotel personnel who gave pursuit after that stabbings at the second beach should \\"Stay back, I am not after Egyptians.\\" Nevertheless, hotel personnel pursued and captured the attacker. ===Palm Sunday 2017 church bombings=== On Palm Sunday 9 April 2017, explosions occurred in St. George's Church in Tanta and St. Mark's Cathedral in Alexandria. 30 people were killed at St. George's and 17 at St. Mark's. ===Minya Coptic Christian bus attack (2017)=== On May 26, 2017, masked gunmen opened fire on a convoy carrying Egyptian Coptic Christians in Minya, Egypt, killing at least 28 and injuring 26. ===Arish attack 2017=Saint Menas church attack 2017=Bombing in Giza region (2018)=== On 28 December 2018, three Vietnamese tourists and an Egyptian tour guide were killed after a roadside bomb struck a tourist bus in the Giza region near Cairo. At least 11 people were wounded. On 29 December, 40 alleged terrorists were killed by the Egyptian security personnel during raids in the Giza and North Sinai regions. ===Cairo bombing (2019)=== On August 5, 2019, at least 20 people were killed and 47 injured after a car, heavily loaded with a bomb, collided with other vehicles, causing an explosion outside National Cancer Institute in Cairo. The interior ministry stated that the car was on its way to a location, where the explosives were to be used to carry out a terrorist operation. ==See also== * List of terrorist attacks * Tal'at Fu'ad Qasim * Terrorism and tourism in Egypt ==References== Egypt Egypt Category:Human rights abuses in Egypt ","title":"Terrorism in Egypt"},{"id":"9077712","text":"Timothy Swanson is an American economics scholar specializing in environmental governance, biodiversity, water management, as well as intellectual property rights and biotechnology regulation.

The historic Auburn Rancheria is located in the Sierra Nevada foothills near Auburn, in Placer County, California. ==The tribe== Total tribal membership of UAIC is approximately 170, with 52 members residing on the Auburn Rancheria (), located in western Placer County near the community of Sheridan.http://www.auburnrancheria.com/about/copy_of_the-land-trust The Tribe is governed by its tribal council, which consists of the chairperson, vice-chairperson, treasurer, secretary and council member at large. (2) ==History== The UAIC is the successor to the Auburn Band, largely Miwok Indians. These indigenous communities of California Indians resided near Auburn, California and survived the depredations of the 19th century. This territory offered UAIC ancestors abundant year-round food sources. Food gathering was based on seasonal ripening, but hunting, gathering and fishing went on all year, with the greatest activity in late summer and early fall. Seasonal harvests were only for those with personal property and much activity and social behavior centered on them. Status, sharing, trading, ceremonies and disagreements were important adjuncts to the gathering and distribution of food. Grasses, herbs, and rushes provided food and material for clothing and baskets. Seeds were gathered by the use of a seed beater and tray. They were then parched, steamed, dried, cooked into a mush or dried for storage. Bear hunts were ceremonial. Black bears were usually hunted in winter, where lighted poles were used to drive them from their dens. Grizzlies that lived on the valley floor were greatly feared and rarely hunted. The historic existence of the Auburn Indian Community is documented in the Bureau of Indian Affairs' correspondence dating back to the early 1900s. In 1917, the United States government purchased of land near Auburn, California, that was put in trust for the Auburn Band and formally established a reservation, known as the Auburn Rancheria.California Indians and Their Reservations. San Diego State University Library & Information Access. 2009 (retrieved 10 March 2009) However, with the passage of the Indian Reorganization Act (“IRA”), 25 U.S.C. § 671 et seq., in 1934, a dramatic shift in Federal Indian policy occurred, whereby Congress moved away from assimilationist Indian policies towards policies of self-governance.Tribal Self-Government and the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934. Michigan Law Review. Vol. 70, No. 5 (April 1972): 955. (retrieved through Jstor.org on 10 March 2009) The governmental structure allowed by the IRA placed the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) in charge of elections among Indian tribes to allow each tribe to accept or reject the tribal reorganization provisions of the IRA. In 1935, the 36 adult members of the Auburn Band voted 16 to 5 to reject the IRA.About Us  The Restoration Act. United Auburn Indian Community: Auburn Rancheria. (retrieved 10 March 2009) The United States Congress enacted the Rancheria Termination Act in 1953, which terminated federal trust responsibilities to the Auburn Band, among many other California Indian tribes. Only a parcel of land with a park and a church remained after the government sold the Auburn Rancheria land. In 1967, the United States terminated their recognition of the Auburn Band. President Richard Nixon ended termination policy in 1970. In 1978, during the 100th United States Congress, both the United States Senate and House of Representatives created a new federal Indian policy based on Native American self-determination. On July 20, 1991, descendants of the historic Auburn Band reorganized their tribal government and adopted the Constitution of the United Auburn Indian Community (UAIC), which they presented to the BIA on August 30, 1991 with a request that the Bureau “formally recognize the United Auburn Indian Community of the Auburn Rancheria.” An Act of Congress passed the Auburn Indian Restoration Act, which restored the Tribe's federal recognition in 1994. A provision in the act permits the tribe to purchase lands in Placer County to create a new reservation.

He was Parson of Douglas, Lanarkshire, prior to 15 January 1561/2 when he was awarded the income of the Third of the Benefices for that parish. He was appointed to the College of Justice on 13 November 1565 as an Extraordinary Lord in place of Adam Bothwell, Bishop of Orkney. ===Reign of Mary Queen of Scots=== Accused with his brother, William Douglas of Whittingehame, of involvement in the conspiracy to murder David Riccio, he was obliged to retire to France for some time. But the husband of Mary, Queen of Scots, Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, secured his return to Scotland, where Douglas then successfully negotiated the pardons of the other conspirators, gazetted on 25 December 1566. He then entered into the intrigues of James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell for the assassination of Darnley, and acted as the agent between them and the Earl of Morton. According to the on-the- scaffold confession of his servant Thomas Binning, he was actually present at Kirk o' Field on the night of the murder (9/10 February 1567). In the confusion of the hour Douglas lost his shoes, which he had removed, which were found in the morning and known to be his. No pursuit was however, at that time, instituted against him. Later Morton said that Archibald and his brother Robert had helped find the Casket Letters. When George Dalgleish was threatened with torture he asked to speak to Archibald, and showed Robert where he had hidden the letters.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 2 (1900), 605 On 2 June 1568, he was raised to a Lord Ordinary in the College of Justice in place of John Leslie, Bishop of Ross. Archibald was often sent as a messenger to England. He caused concern in January 1569 at Allerton when he let slip that he already knew that Mary was going to be transferred from Bolton Castle to Tutbury Castle, which meant to be secret.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 2 (1900), 605 In September 1570 Regent Lennox sent him to the Earl of Sussex, Governor of Berwick upon Tweed to congratulate him on his victory over the Border friends of Mary, Queen of Scots, and to negotiate support for the Regent's authority. Shortly afterwards he obtained the Parsonage of Glasgow, but with some difficulty as the Kirk at first felt him to be unqualified. In January 1572, however, the requisite sanction was obtained, and he received the Thirds of Benefices for Newlands, Glasgow thereafter. ===Siege of Edinburgh Castle=== In April 1572 he was arrested following the discovery that he was assisting the party of Mary, Queen of Scots and Sir William Kirkcaldy of Grange who held Edinburgh Castle, by bringing money sent from the Duke of Alba from the Spanish Netherlands. He was at the same time accused of conspiring for the death of the Earl of Morton. The Marshall of Berwick and diplomat Sir William Drury regretted his arrest because he had plotted with Douglas to kidnap George, Lord Seton, who was negotiating for Mary with the Duke of Alba, and their plan did not take effect.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 4, (1905), p. 297 He was warded (held under house arrest) at Stirling Castle (another source says Loch Leven Castle). Ten years after these events, the English diplomat Thomas Randolph wrote to Francis Walsingham to certify that Drury had found Mr Archibald a \\"fit instrument\\" to secretly negotiate with Grange, William Maitland of Lethington, Melville, and others, especially to persuade them to surrender the castle. This, said Randolph, resulted in his imprisonment at Dumbarton Castle. Drury and Archibald were involved in the sale of Mary's jewels for cash and loans raised against them. Grange's accounts regarding Mary's jewels survived the siege.Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1581-1583, vol. 6 (Edinburgh, 1910), pp. 134-5: National Records of Scotland, E35/11. Douglas, for a time, kept Mary's wedding ring.A. Francis Steuart, Seigneur Davie: A Sketch Life of David Riccio (London, 1922), p. 114 quoting NRS E35/11/4. ===Later years=== He appears to have lived, if not in prison, at least in privacy, during the Regency of Morton. On 11 November 1578 he was restored to his former place on the bench, following a request letter from King James VI to that effect. On 31 December, however, he was denounced to the Privy Council of Scotland as guilty of Darnley's murder, and orders were given for his arrest. But having been forewarned by his kinsman George Douglas of Longniddry, he fled from his wife's tower-house at Morham to England. Queen Elizabeth first agreed to have him returned upon the guarantee of \\"unsuspect judges and other persons on the assise\\", but this guarantee could not be given so he remained for the time being in England. On 28 November 1581, he was forfeited by Act of Parliament for the murder of Lord Darnley, which, they argued, was proved by his flight to England, and the evidence of his servant Thomas Binning, who had, in June 1581, already been executed for the same crime. Owing to the influence of his friend, the Master of Gray, he returned on a safe-conduct to Scotland, arriving in Edinburgh on 15 April 1586. His (nominal) trial took place on 26 May, reported at length in Pitcairn's Criminal Trials. He was acquitted. There was great uproar. To make matters worse he was then appointed by James VI his personal Ambassador to Elizabeth, a post he took up in September. While in that post he assisted the Master of Gray, William Keith, and Sir Robert Melville of Murdocairny to move Elizabeth towards clemency for Mary Queen of Scots. He was at length dismissed from this post, being succeeded by Sir Robert Melville. In January 1601 his sister, Jean Douglas, Lady Saltcoats, wrote to him for fine London cloth for gowns for her daughters, who were of age to married.HMC Salisbury Hatfield, vol. 14 (London, 1923), p. 161. The date of his death is unknown. A Mr. Archibald Douglas, Archdeacon of Glasgow (in that post prior to November 1596), is mentioned in the Privy Council Registers on 28 October 1598, and again on 4 December 1599, but it is not known if this is the same person. ==Family== Archibald Douglas married, about 1578, (as her third husband) Jane (d. before August 1599), daughter of Patrick Hepburn, 3rd Earl of Bothwell. ==References== *An Historical Account of the Senators of the College of Justice of Scotland, by Sir David Dalrymple of Hailes, (Edinburgh, 1849), pp. 125-128. *The Register of the Privy Council of Scotland, edited by David Masson, (Edinburgh, 1881), volumes IV (1585–1592), and V (1592–1599). *The Scots Peerage, by Sir James Balfour Paul, vol.

An investigation reveals that a recent batch of Tylium fuel contains impurities and Roslin calls upon Xeno Fenner, the director of the fleet's refinery ship, for answers. When Fenner meets Roslin and Admiral Adama, he is sarcastic and uncooperative, calling the situation a \\"glitch.\\" He admits that it may be his workers' way of getting some attention after repeatedly being ignored regarding the squalid and dangerous conditions they face every day without a single break. Roslin doesn't sympathize, explaining that fuel production is critical and must be maintained. When Fenner quotes text from an underground book by Gaius Baltar, \\"If you hear the people, you never have to fear the people\\" and threatens a few more \\"glitches,\\" Roslin has him arrested. Adama is stunned by her action and inquires about the book. Visibly angered, Roslin whispers that Gaius Baltar's attorney has passed a manuscript around the fleet written by Baltar entitled, My Triumphs, My Mistakes. It deals with class struggle, and she says she is thinking about having a \\"good ol' fashioned book burning.\\" Adama contacts Chief Tyrol, informs him of Fenner's arrest, and orders him to go to the refinery ship to take charge of the situation. Tyrol's wife Cally admits to Tyrol that she has read Baltar's book, which discusses the unfair labor differences between the people of the Twelve Colonies. She questions why the people from the poorer colonies like Gemenon, Sagittaron, and Aerelon are forced to work in harsh blue-collar jobs while the more elite and educated colonials from places like Caprica, Tauron and Virgon get to keep their plush white-collar jobs. Roslin goes to Baltar's cell and demands that he hand over the pages from his book. She lies, saying it was intercepted before anyone could read it, and orders the guards to tear the room apart. She concludes with a partial strip search of Baltar during which Six appears in Baltar's mind and tells him to protect his dignity. Six slides her hand into his open pants, but Baltar stops her. He withdraws the pages of his book and surrenders them to Roslin, who sneers that she's been \\"dying to see how it ends\\" and mocks his attempt to appear as a \\"man of the people.\\" Meanwhile, Tyrol arrives on the refinery ship and takes a tour of the facility, led by a foreman named Cabott. He witnesses the somber glances from the tired, grime- covered workers who are both men and women ranging in age from the elderly to mere children. Tyrol goes to the massive Tylium storage room where a single, dwindling pile of ore remains. Cabott says they're lucky if the supply lasts long enough to get them out of the system. Next, Tyrol goes to the main conveyor line where the work has completely shut down. Tyrol asks for a reason for the shutdown, but the workers remain silently defiant until a young boy named Milo speaks up and says the pressure seals are broken. Tyrol notices that the seals are completely missing and have been removed by the workers in protest of Fenner's arrest. Tyrol returns to Galactica and informs Roslin and Adama of the missing seals and explains the workers are buying time for their pleas to be heard. He adds that some of the workers have been doing the same grueling job since the attack on the Colonies and requests Roslin accede to some of their demands for a break. Roslin objects, however, saying it is just as difficult to work aboard the algae processing, recycling and waste handling ships. She sees their work stoppage as extortion and demands the names of the organizers. Tyrol hesitantly surrenders Cabott name. Cabott is arrested and joins Fenner in an adjacent cell. When Tyrol visits them, he finds that Cabott is having a breakdown and injuring himself. Fenner reminds Tyrol that Cabott was tortured by the Cylons back on New Caprica, and confinement is causing him post-traumatic stress. Tyrol tells Fenner there is no time for games and demands Cabott reveal where the seals have been hidden. Fenner hesitates, then angrily reveals that they were hidden in the air vents. Tyrol then has the men released and work is resumed aboard the refinery ship. Later, Tyrol goes to Colonial One to talk to Roslin. He explains parents are passing down their skills to their children, and they are forever stuck doing the same job in the next generation. He says they should be given a chance to choose their future. Roslin understands the problem and tells him to make a list of colonists with relevant skills to supplement those aboard the labor ships. Next, Tyrol deals with a protesting young man named Danny Noon who was pulled from Dogsville. Noon had worked a summer job on a farm to earn money for college, but agriculture is not his career choice. Tyrol tells him the job is only temporary and has the angry youth escorted away. Tyrol then finds a copy of Baltar's book and opens to a page entitled The Emerging Aristocracy and the Emerging Underclass. Tyrol goes to Baltar's cell and refers to the book. Baltar learns the truth that the book has been leaked and asks Tyrol what he thinks about it. Tyrol responds that he thinks it's a load of crap, disbelieving Baltar's claim that he grew up on a farm on Aerelon - especially since Baltar's accent is different from other Aerelons he knows. Baltar, speaking in an Aerelon accent, states that he learned to mimic the Caprican accent to help hide the fact he was from Aerelon, a poor farming world known as the \\"food basket for the twelve worlds.\\" Baltar explains the purpose of the book was to show that class-strife has continued to follow the fleet well after the Cylon attack, and they will find that those in the aristocracy will continue to hold onto their power. Tyrol returns to the refinery ship where work halts when the conveyor system becomes jammed. Fenner says the belt must be repaired or else a back-up will occur which could cause the \\"hot\\" Tylium further down the line to go critical and cause a chain reaction that will take out the whole ship. Without stopping the slipping belt, Tyrol finds the problem is a jammed drive mechanism, but he is unable to reach it. Danny Noon frees the jam but injures his arm in the processes. Fed up, Tyrol walks to main control levers and shuts down the entire factory. He declares the workers to be on strike. Aboard Galactica, Starbuck finds her flight mission delayed by hangar workers who are playing cards on a Raptor wing. She demands they get back to work where the senior deckhand, Pollux, tells her that they are only servicing vital missions per orders from Chief Tyrol. Tyrol is immediately arrested. Admiral Adama angrily confronts Tyrol in the brig and orders him to call off the work stoppage, but Tyrol refuses. Adama says he will not tolerate the disobedience of orders, calling it mutiny and reminding him that mutineers are shot, but Tyrol stays put. Adama grabs the phone and orders the arrest of Cally. Alarmed, Tyrol asks what he's doing. To get his point across, Adama says he will execute Cally as mutineer and continue with the rebellious deck crew if he has to. He admits it's something he doesn't want to do, but will to maintain the survival of the fleet. Tyrol relents and calls off the strike. Adama tells him to report to Roslin who wishes to discuss the labor situation. Tyrol meets with Roslin on Colonial One and they talk about the cultural vocations that some colonists are locked into by birth. Tyrol suggests setting up a training program to allow the colonists to learn more than one trade, and a work rotation started so that those in dangerous and dirty jobs get an equal chance to work in more comfortable and safer positions in the fleet. He adds that he'd like to see some of Colonial One's crew get their hands dirty for a change. Roslin agrees, but tells Tyrol to consider the reestablishment of the worker's union that he led back on New Caprica as it will ensure stability within the fleet. Later, Tyrol calls his deck crew to muster when Starbuck arrives and demands to know why Seelix is 20 minutes late for her first day of pilot training. Seelix is confused and Tyrol apologizes, explaining that Seelix has been promoted to Ensign and assigned to flight training - something she was turned down for earlier because her job as an avionics specialist was too important. Tyrol pins the Ensign rank on her collar and salutes her while Starbuck tells the newly recruited nugget to double-time it to debriefing. Seelix rushes off with an excited smile on her face. ==Notes== *The original production title for this episode was \\"Our Enemies, Ourselves.\\"Bradley Thompson, writer for the re-imagined series explains the episode name change to the Battlestar Wiki ==References== ==External links== * \\"Dirty Hands\\" at the Battlestar Wiki * \\"Dirty Hands\\" at Syfy.com * * Category:2007 American television episodes Category:Battlestar Galactica (season 3) episodes Category:Television episodes written by Jane Espenson fr:Saison 3 de Battlestar Galactica#Grève générale ","title":"Dirty Hands (Battlestar Galactica)"},{"id":"9077779","text":"Dumitru D.

The building is a public library that was constructed in 1909. Prior to 1909, Oregon's library was housed in different buildings, none of which were designed to house a library. The library was built using a grant from wealthy philanthropist Andrew Carnegie. The grant was obtained after Oregon's citizens voted to change Oregon's library from a city library to a township library. The building was completed by 1908 but the library did not begin operation until 1909. The Oregon Library was designed by Chicago architects Pond and Pond. The Ponds were members of the Eagle's Nest Art Colony, founded by Lorado Taft, and their association with Taft and the colony led them to design the library. Their design was influenced by the colony, and a combination of two architectural styles, Classical Revival and the Arts and Crafts movement. The completed library included a second floor art gallery to which members of Eagle's Nest donated works for a permanent collection. The gallery's collection includes 64 paintings and sculptures as well as a Currier and Ives lithograph collection appraised at US$700,000. The Oregon Public Library was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 2003, three years later it was included as a contributing property in a historic district that received the National Register designation. ==History== While the library building dates to the early 20th century the move toward intellectual outreach in Oregon started years before. The first Oregon library was organized in 1872, though it had no building of its own. Before the library had its own building, library books were stored in a drug store and then in the County Treasurer's office. Eventually the Oregon Library occupied rented office space in the First National Bank building. This situation persisted until 1905 when Oregon voters voiced their collective opinion on the library's future.Behrens, p. 14. The citizens of Oregon were faced with a dilemma in 1905: either allow Oregon's library to remain, truly, Oregon's city library, or, by referendum, allow Oregon's library to make the shift into a township library. This change would allow the library one distinct advantage; it would qualify the library for a grant from Andrew Carnegie for the construction of a new building. Initially, Carnegie promised US$7,000 for the new library but once voters approved the change the grant amount was increased to $10,000. The grant, aside from requiring the library to hold \\"township library\\" status, required a site to be selected prior to the grant application process; a site, at the corner of Oregon's Jefferson and Third Streets, was selected. ==Art galleryEagle's Nest influence=== The art gallery on the library's second floor was built with influence from sculptor Lorado Taft. Even before the library was built, members of the Eagle's Nest Art Colony were pushing for the new building to include a second- story art gallery. The colony, founded in 1898 by sculptor Lorado Taft, was based on the bluffs flanking the east bank of the Rock River, overlooking Oregon.Lorado Taft Campus , Regional History Center, Northern Illinois University Libraries. Retrieved March 4, 2007. Later in Carnegie's philanthropy his secretary James Bertram laid out strict requirements, including requirements which discouraged multiple uses for Carnegie libraries. Another requirement stipulated that Bertram approve library plans prior to grant approval or construction.Schnell, p. 13. The Oregon library, however, was constructed before Bertram's requirements were published and includes the gallery. The art colony at Eagle's Nest was populated by Chicago artists, all members of the Chicago Art Institute or the University of Chicago art department, who gathered in Ogle County to escape the summer heat of Chicago.Schnell, pp. 52-53. Two of the charter members of the art colony were the Chicago architects, Allen and Irving Kane Pond, who designed the Oregon Public Library building. It was the Ponds' association with the Eagle's Nest Art Colony that led them to design the library. The building was constructed after the Carnegie grant approval, and its first use came in October 1908 by Leon A. Malkielski, a colony member, for an exhibition of 100 paintings. The library proper did not begin providing its services until 1909. The colony tried to contribute to area culture by requiring its members to hold art shows, lectures, and other exhibitions throughout the early 20th century. With the library complete it began to play a role in those exhibitions. Hamlin Garland, a 1921 Pulitzer Prize recipient for literature, spoke at the Oregon library while he was a member of the Eagle's Nest Colony. ===Collections=== The gallery on the second floor of the library building was not formally dedicated until July 4, 1918. That date marked the beginning of the library's permanent collection, which started with additions from members of the Eagle's Nest Colony. Members donated twelve statues, twenty oil paintings, and four portraits to the permanent collection of the art gallery. One of the statues in the collection is a 4-foot (1.2-m) plaster study of The Eternal Indian by Lorado Taft. It was completed in 1908 as he prepared to create the Black Hawk Statue at the original site of the Eagle's Nest Colony. The entire permanent collection consists of 32 paintings and 32 sculptures from Eagle's Nest artists. A citizen left the library a Currier and Ives lithograph collection which contains 46 Currier and Ives lithographs and 14 lithographs by Nathaniel Currier. The two collections have been appraised at over $700,000.Behrens, p. 15. In addition to the substantial historical art collection held by the library gallery the collection consists of works by local artists. One Oregon resident has donated artwork from the annual Grand Detour Art Show regularly. Other area residents have donated pieces as well. In all, the library holds about 30 contemporary works by local artists. ==Architecture== Arts and Crafts. The library is designed with an eye toward late 19th-century and early 20th-century movements in architecture. While it contains many elements common to Classical Revival architecture, the building's asymmetry and playfully creative style are distinctly characteristic of the Arts and Crafts Movement. The building was designed by the Chicago architectural firm of Pond and Pond and is constructed of buff-colored brick. Red-brick belt coursing and accents contrast the buff-colored brick on the majority of the facade. The two-story Oregon Public Library has a full brick basement and approximately of floor space. The building, though based on Classical architecture, is not entirely a Classical building. Its rooflines, main entrance, and the placement and style of the windows are all asymmetrical in nature, a hallmark of the Arts and Crafts style. Its simple massing and noticeable lack of ornamentation throughout the structure connects the building closely to the Arts and Crafts movement. This influence is seen most prominently on the building's interior.Behrens, p. 7. The four-panel wooden interior double doors are designed in an Arts and Crafts motif. Though Arts and Crafts is specifically regarded as a movement within architecture, as opposed to a full-blown style, there are elements that are considered typical to buildings designed in the style. Examples include, dark, heavy woodwork and very simple ornamentation. The Oregon Public Library contains functional elements associated with that movement. Dark woodwork is found throughout the building, first in the stairwell to the gallery and its balusters and newel posts and then in the four-panel wooden interior door. The ceilings are coffered and have exposed wooden beams. Also located in the interior is a large 1909 wooden floor clock, a built-in storage cabinet, and two wooden fuse boxes that all evoke the Arts and Crafts movement.Behrens, p. 17. The building does demonstrate elements of Classical Revival architecture but they are minimal and concentrated around the front entrance. Below the front entrance hood there are two stone pilasters and a stone lintel, as well as relief work adorning the pediment; leading to the front entrance are seven concrete stairs. The entire entry facade is a gable-front, temple style design and on the library's east wing there are stone-capped modified buttresses. Each of these elements demonstrates the Classical Revival style. ==Significance== The Oregon Public Library was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on May 9, 2003 for its architectural and educational significance.Behrens, p. 13. The building represents a good example of the Arts and Crafts movement in architecture. As a Carnegie library, the Oregon Public Library satisfied the requirements laid out for listing on the National Register in the Illinois Carnegie Libraries Multiple Property Submission. When the Oregon Commercial Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006 the Oregon Library was included as a contributing property.Novak, p. 28. The library building is considered the most \\"outstanding\\" of the Craftsman or Arts and Crafts buildings within the historic district boundaries.Novak, pp. 52-53. ==See also== *Black Hawk Statue *Lowden State Park ==Notes== ==References== *Novak, Alice. \\"Oregon Commercial Historic District,\\" (PDF), National Register of Historic Places Nomination Form, July 12, 2006, HAARGIS Database, Illinois Historic Preservation Agency.

Edgardo Cozarinsky (; born 1939 in Buenos Aires,IMDb.com Argentina) is a writer and filmmaker. He is best known for his Spanish-language novel Vudú urbano. ==Life== Cozarinsky was born to an Argentine family of Ukrainian-Jewish descent. His name reflects his mother's enthusiasm for the writings of Edgar Allan Poe, while his surname comes from his grandparents, Ukrainian Jewish immigrants who arrived in Argentina from Kiev and Odessa in the late nineteenth century. After an adolescence spent in neighbourhood cinemas showing double bills of old Hollywood films and reading an inordinate amount of fiction in Spanish, English and French (favourite authors – Robert Louis Stevenson, Joseph Conrad, Henry James), he studied literature at Buenos Aires University, wrote for local and Spanish cinephile magazines, and published an early essay on James, which he developed from his university thesis – El laberinto de la apariencia (The Labyrinth of Appearance, 1964), a book which he later suppressed. In his early twenties he became acquainted with Jorge Luis Borges, Adolfo Bioy Casares and Silvina Ocampo in Buenos Aires. In 1973 he won a literary prize for his essay on gossip as narrative device in the writings of James and Proust. In 1974 he published Borges y el cine, a book that he expanded in every reprint (Spain, 1978 and 2002, and translations). He has since that time also declined to have this book reprinted. Cozarinsky visited Europe from September 1966 to June 1967, stopping for a visit to New York City on his return to Buenos Aires. Arriving back home, he more fully committed himself to his writing. He wrote for the culture sections of the Argentine weeklies Primera Plana and Panorama, then he produced his first film. It was an underground feature shot on weekends over the course of a year, knowing that it could not pass the local censorship of the period. It was nevertheless screened at festivals throughout Europe and the United States. Its title was already a challenge – ... (Puntos suspensivos – Dot Dot Dot). During the turmoil of Argentina's Dirty War, Cozarinsky left Buenos Aires for Paris, where he concentrated on his filmmaking. He produced fiction films and \\"essays\\", mixing documentary material with personal reflections on the material. The most distinguished of these is La Guerre d'un seul homme (One Man's War, 1981), a confrontation between Ernst Jünger's wartime diaries and French newsreels of the occupation period. At a time when European television networks were willing to support such ventures, Cozarinsky was able to develop this approach in a series of original works. During the period 1970-1990, Cozarinsky published little. However, his sole novel from the period gained a wide audience - Vudú urbano (Urban voodoo, 1985), a mixture of fiction and essay not unlike his film work, with prologues by Susan Sontag and Cuban writer Guillermo Cabrera Infante. Cozarinsky returned to Buenos Aires for a short stay after the end of Argentina's military junta. He then returned three years later to produce Guerreros y cautivas (Warriors and Captive Women), filmed in the country's far southern reaches. He visited Argentina several times after that, occasionally filming segments or backgrounds for his films. His most adventurous later films were Rothschild's Violin and Ghosts of Tangier, both made between 1995 and 1996. Cozarinsky was diagnosed with cancer in 1999. This motivated him to dedicate his remaining time to his writing.In his own words: \\"I always wanted to be a writer, and had not dared publish, even finish what I started...\\" While still in the hospital following his diagnosis he wrote the first two stories for La novia de Odessa (The Bride from Odessa). From that date on, his film work became sparse and he started publishing \\"all the books I had not put on paper\\", fiction mostly but also essays and chronicles. He became established as a Spanish-language writer, and his works were also translated into several other languages. During this period he spent most of his time in Buenos Aires, returning to Paris for regular short stays. In 2005 he wrote and directed a play (Squash) and wrote a mini-opera Raptos (Raptures). In that year he also appeared on the alternative stage along with his medical doctor, in one of Vivi Tellas' \\"documentary theater\\" ventures -Cozarinsky y su médico. In 2008 he started work on the libretto for a chamber opera with the musician Pablo Mainetti – Ultramarina, based on motives from his own novel El rufián moldavo (The Moldavian Pimp). Cozarinsky has filmed in such diverse locations as Budapest, Rotterdam, Tallinn, Tangiers, Vienna, Granada, Saint Petersburg, Seville and Patagonia. He presently alternates most of his time between Buenos Aires and Paris.He considers Buenos Aires his pleasure basis and Paris his cultural \\"department store\\". ==Partial bibliography== * Vudú urbano (Urban Voodoo), stories, essays, memories (1985) * La novia de Odessa (The Bride from Odessa), short stories (2001)(First prize to a volume of short stories, City of Buenos Aires; Platinum prize to a volume of short stories, Konex Foundation) * El pase del testigo (Passing the baton / The Witness Goes By), essays and chronicles (2001) * El rufián moldavo (The Moldavian Pimp), novel (2004) * Museo del chisme (Museum of Gossip), essay and stories (2005) * Tres fronteras (Three Frontiers), short stories (2006) * Palacios plebeyos (Plebeian Palaces), chronicles and a short story (2006) * Maniobras nocturnas (Night-time maneuvers), novel (2007) * Milongas, chronicles and short stories (2007) * Burundanga, short stories (2009) * Lejos de dónde (Far from where), novel (2009)(Prize for the best novel 2008–2010, Academia Argentina de Letras) * Blues, chronicles and memories (2010) * La tercera mañana (The Third Morning), novel (2010 Spain)(2011 Argentina) * Dinero para fantasmas (Money for Ghosts), novel, (2012 Argentina)(2013 Spain) * Nuevo museo del chisme (New Gossip Museum), essay and stories (2013) * En ausencia de guerra (In Absence of War), novel (2014) * Disparos en la oscuridad (Shots in the Dark), essays (2015) * Dark, novel (2016) * Niño enterrado (Buried Child), memories and chronicles (2016) ==Film work (feature-length and short films, fiction and \\"essays\\")== * ...

Desai may be a native of Ithaca, New York. ==Early career== In 1996, Desai was the founding Editor in Chief who became the CEO of TheStreet.com, a post he held for 4 months before being fired by Jim Cramer for myriad reasons, including drinking on the job, falsifying business agreements, and blackmail. In November 1997, he wrote a series of diary entries for Slate magazine discussing, among other topics, his purported position as a strategic analyst at Quantum Corporation. ==Controversies== In February 1999, Desai started at Scient, working out of its San Francisco office. While there, he told coworkers that his pregnant wife, Jennifer Call, was dying of cancer, and subsequently died. But Call was not pregnant, nor did she have cancer. That August, the couple filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences. In 2000, Desai pledged $2 million to the University of Washington and another $2 million to the University of Florida, along with $1 million to the University of New Hampshire poetry programs. No university ever received more than a few thousand dollars of the pledge. Also in 2000, a handful of poets, including then U.S. poet laureate Robert Pinsky, joined an advisory board for a national poetry foundation that Desai was starting. All the advisers subsequently resigned after Desai displayed erratic behavior. Desai later blamed his erratic behavior on having acquired a rare degenerative nerve disease. Capping off a busy year, Desai married his second wife, Christine Klingler, but was not yet divorced from his first wife, making him a bigamist. In January 2001, Formulasys, a privately held tech consulting company, hired Desai as CEO. He was asked to resign five days after getting the top job. The firm claims he had been falsifying contracts with big-name companies like Vodafone. In March 2002, Slate began publishing diary entries for \\"Robert Klingler,\\" who purported to be the CEO of BMW's North American division. Slate's readers informed the editorial staff that neither Google's search engine nor Nexis's database turned up any mention of a Robert Klingler in the automobile industry. Slate discovered no one with such a name worked for BMW, and inquiries into Klingler's life led them to name Desai as the actual author and a hoaxster. ==References== Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Harvard University alumni Category:American chief executives ","title":"Ravi Desai"},{"id":"9077850","text":"Schreckensteinia is a moth in the family Schreckensteiniidae.

The other two are the Oregon Public Library, listed in 2003, and the Chana School, listed in 2005. ==Establishment history== The Oregon Commercial Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 16, 2006. The National Register of Historic Places Registration form was dated July 12, 2006 and was completed by the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency. ==Boundaries== The boundaries for the district are roughly encompassed by Jefferson Street on the south, Franklin Street on the north, and 3rd and 5th Street on the east and west. The grounds cover and include 62 buildings and objects. Of those, 51 are contributing properties, 44 buildings, two structures and five objects. Another eleven buildings are considered non-contributing to the overall general historical character of the historic district.HAARGIS Database, Oregon Commercial Historic District, Property Information Report, Illinois Historic Preservation Agency. Retrieved November 19, 2015. ==Architecture== The 44 buildings, five objects and two structures that make up the contributing properties of the historic district represent a wide range of architectural styles and uses. Italianate, Romanesque Revival, Queen Anne, Art Nouveau, Art Deco and the Arts and Crafts Movement, and other styles and movements, have all had their influences on the collection of mostly low level commercial architecture in the district.National Register of Historic Places Registration Form, Oregon Commercial Historic District, HAARGIS Database, Illinois Preservation Agency. Retrieved November 19, 2015. ==Structures== Of the numerous buildings two of them are listed individually on the National Register of Historic Places. They are the Arts and Crafts Oregon Public Library and the Romanesque Revival Ogle County Courthouse. The buildings are a mix of commercial, government and private residence usage, mostly some apartments on the upper floors of some buildings. Aside from buildings other sites are included, such as, cannons, a drinking fountain, sculptures and a well house. ===F.G. Jones Block=== The 300 Block of Washington, including the F.G. Jones Block. This two-story Italianate structure is attached to two other historically significant buildings at the corner of Washington and Third Streets in Oregon. It is the most ornately detailed of the three. ===Jacobs Block=== The three-story Italianate Jacobs Block was known also as the National Clothing House. The structure was built sometime around 1870 and the aluminum awning was added in the 1960s. ===Masonic Temple Lodge No. 420=== The Old Ogle County Courthouse. This three story yellow brick building is in the 100 Block of South Fourth Street. Its exterior is decorated with ivory brick detailing and it sports a three globe milk glass sign over the door on its second story. ===Old Ogle County Courthouse=== The Romanesque Revival Ogle County Courthouse stands in the middle of a large public square. Though no longer the county's primary judiciary center some county office still occupy the first two floors. The building was designed by Chicago architect George O. Garnsey and constructed in 1891. ===Oregon City Hall=== The Oregon Coliseum. The Oregon City Hall was constructed in 1920, though its front facade, specifically the windows, have seen some renovations and replacement. The building is still home to the city government in Oregon, Illinois. ===Oregon Coliseum=== The Oregon Coliseum stands on the corner of Fourth Street and Franklin Street on the north end of the historic district. The largely stucco exterior is heavily influenced by Art Deco style. ===Oregon Public Library=== Oregon City Hall. The design of the Oregon Public Library is a product of the Arts and Crafts Movement. Its second story includes an art gallery which displays works from its permanent collection which includes donated works created by Lorado Taft and Nathaniel Currier. ===Oregon Theater=== This 1910 theater building started as the Star Theater and was later the Oregon Theater. The facade was re-clad around 1940. Though now converted for commercial use the building still features its marquee with \\"OREGON\\" written on it in large neon letters. ===Other notable structures=== Interior, 302 Washington St. * 125 S. Fourth St. * 300 Washington St. * 302 Washington St. * Iron Mike * F.G. Jones Block * Oregon State Savings Bank Building * U.S. Post Office ===Rock River Hotel=== This traditional I-house structure was built around the beginning of the American Civil War and began its history as a private residence. Later it was converted into the Rock River Hotel and then later the Blackhawk Hotel. Oregon once had three historic hotel buildings, the Rock River Hotel is the last of those standing. ===Schiller Piano Company=== The Rock River Hotel. Historically Ogle County's largest employer the Schiller Piano Company building is a industrial building on the northern end of the district. Its iron water tower base still stands in the northwest section of the lot. Both separately contribute to the integrity of the historic district. ===T. Goings Building=== The two-story Italianate T. Goings Building stands out because of wooden pediment over the brick parapet which is emblazoned with the name \\"T. Goings\\". The building was constructed of red brick in 1895. ===The Soldiers' Monument=== The T. Goings Building. The Soldiers' Monument is located on the courthouse square. It features three sculptures by Lorado Taft and an exedra designed by the architects Allen and Iriving Pond. It was originally dedicated to Ogle County veterans of the Civil and Spanish–American Wars, later World War I veterans were added. ===Union Block Opera House=== The three-story structure known as the Union Block, or Hall, Opera House is a Romanesque Revival influenced building constructed around 1880. ===Unity Building=== The Unity Building is an ornate Queen Anne commercial building. It has a large second story oriel which causes it to stand out from the surrounding buildings which are designed in a more sedate Classical Revival and Italianate styles. ==Notes== ==External links== * Category:National Register of Historic Places in Ogle County, Illinois Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Illinois Category:Oregon, Illinois ","title":"Oregon Commercial Historic District"},{"id":"9077900","text":"Urodidae or \\"false burnet moths\\" is a family of moths in the lepidopteran order, representing its own superfamily, Urodoidea, with three genera, one of which, Wockia, occurs in Europe. ==Taxonomy and systematics== Urodidae were previously included in the superfamily Yponomeutoidea (Kyrki, 1984, 1988) and have also been lumped with Galacticidae (Heppner, 1991, 1997) or with other Sesioidea (Heppner, 1998). They belong to the lower part of the lepidopteran clade \\"Apoditrysia\\" (Dugdale et al., 1999) (i.e. not \\"Obtectomera\\"), but their closest relatives are as yet unknown and it is hoped that DNA sequencing can help resolve this question . ==Morphology and identification== Urodidae resemble some Zygaenidae: Procridinae at rest. These small to medium-sized moths measure 11 to 37 mm in wingspan and often have a greyish or mottled forewing background colour. The male adult has a \\"hairpencil\\" on the costa of the hindwing. In the caterpillar, the placement of the setae and structure of the prolegs is diagnostic, and the pupal segments I–II are fixed. On the head, there are no ocelli or \\"chaetosemata\\" and the proboscis even at the base is unscaled. An \\"epiphysis\\" is present on the foreleg (Dugdale et al. (1999), and for more details). ==Distribution== The genera Urodus and Spiladarcha occur in the Neotropics while Wockia asperipunctella occurs in Europe and has recently been found in northern North America (Heppner, 1997; Landry, 1998) and unless this is a recent invasion the species would be a good example of a Holarctic distribution pattern. ==Biology and host plants== Pupa of an Urodidae species Pupa found under a roof in the Km41 camp (BDFFP) in the Central Amazon The biology is poorly known, but the larvae can be found on various tree species including some fruit trees. The \\"bumelia webworm moth\\" (Urodus parvula) is recorded on Lauraceae: (avocado=Persea), Fagaceae (Quercus), Sapotaceae (Sideroxylon) and Erythroxylaceae: Erythroxylum. Urodus parvula has also been reared on Rutaceae (Citrus) and Malvaceae (Hibiscus). W. asperipunctella has in North America been reared from quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) (Landry, 1998) and also Salix in Europe. The pupa is contained in an open-mesh cocoon, which can be bright orange in colour, and is sometimes suspended on a very long thread below a leaf. ==Provisional list of species (based on Lepindex)== *Geoesthia ceylonica Sohn, 2014 [type locality Sri Lanka] *Spiladarcha capnodes (Walsingham, 1914) (originally in Anchimacheta) [type locality Mexico] *Spiladarcha derelicta Meyrick, 1913 [type locality British Guiana] *Spiladarcha iodes (Walsingham, 1914) (originally in Anchimacheta) [type locality Mexico] *Spiladarcha tolmetes (Walsingham, 1914) (originally in Anchimacheta) [type locality Mexico] *Urodus amphilocha Meyrick, 1923 *Urodus aphanoptis Meyrick, 1930 *Urodus aphrogama Meyrick, 1936 *Urodus auchmera Walsingham, 1914 *Urodus brachyanches Meyrick, 1931 *Urodus calligera Zeller, 1877 *Urodus carabopa Meyrick, 1925 *Urodus chiquita Busck, 1910 *Urodus chrysoconis Meyrick, 1932 *Urodus costaricae Busck, 1910 *Urodus cumulata Walsingham, 1914 *Urodus cyanombra Meyrick, 1913 *Urodus cyclopica Meyrick, 1930 *Urodus decens Meyrick, 1925 *Urodus distincta Strand, 1911 *Urodus favigera Meyrick, 1913 *Urodus fonteboae Strand, 1911 *Urodus forficulella (Walsingham, 1897) (originally in Paratiquadra) *Urodus fulminalis Meyrick, 1931 *Urodus fumosa (Zeller, 1863) (originally in Trichostibas) *Urodus hephaestiella (Zeller, 1877) *Urodus hexacentris Meyrick, 1931 *Urodus imitans Felder, 1875 *Urodus imitata Druce, 1884 *Urodus iophlebia Zeller, 1877 *Urodus isoxesta Meyrick, 1932 *Urodus isthmiella Busck, 1910 *?Urodus lissopeda (Meyrick, 1932) (originally in Pygmocrates) [type locality Brazil] *Urodus lithophaea Meyrick, 1913 *Urodus marantica Walsingham, 1914 *Urodus merida Strand, 1911 *Urodus mirella (Möschler, 1890) (originally in Pexicnemidia) *Urodus modesta Druce, 1884 *Urodus niphatma Meyrick, 1925 *Urodus opticosema Meyrick, 1930 *Urodus ovata Zeller, 1877 *Urodus pallidicostella Walsingham, 1897 *Urodus pamporphyra Meyrick, 1936 *Urodus parvula Edwards, 1881 *Urodus perischias Meyrick, 1925 *Urodus porphyrina Meyrick, 1932 *Urodus praetextata Meyrick, 1913 *Urodus procridias Meyrick, 1936 *Urodus pulvinata Meyrick, 1923 *Urodus sanctipaulensis Strand, 1911 *Urodus scythrochalca Meyrick, 1932 *Urodus sordidata Zeller, 1877 *Urodus spumescens Meyrick, 1925 *Urodus staphylina Meyrick, 1932 *Urodus subcaerulea Dognin, 1910 *Urodus sympiestis Meyrick, 1925 *Urodus tineiformis (Walker, 1856) (originally in Aperla) *Urodus transverseguttata Zeller, 1877 *Urodus triancycla Meyrick, 1931 *Urodus venatella Busck, 1910 [type locality Brasilien] *Urodus xiphura Meyrick, 1931 *Wockia asperipunctella Bruand, 1850 (originally in Anacampsis) **=Patula asperipunctella Bruand, 1850 [type locality France] **=Wockia funebrella Heinemann, 1870 ==References== *Heppner, J.

The line currently runs from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in Woodlawn to Middle River, both in Baltimore County, Maryland (on opposite sides) with selected trips terminating at Downtown Baltimore City Hall, passing through the west and east sides and the downtown area of Baltimore City. Service operates every 12 minutes during rush hour, and every 15 minutes at most other times during its hours of operation. The line serves the corridors of Edmondson Avenue in West Baltimore, including the communities of Edmondson Village, Allendale, and Rosemont, and Fayette Street and Eastern Avenue in East Baltimore, serving Patterson Park, Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center and Essex.Quick Bus 40 Schedule MTA Maryland, effective 2009-2-8, retrieved May 31, 2011 Unlike a local bus, the 40 does not stop at every bus stop along its route. Rather, its stops are limited to certain locations of importance, including transfer points to other bus lines, major landmarks, and other busy intersections selected by MTA. In all, there are 32 stops along the route in each direction, which are all identified in printed timetables. ==History== The Route 40 started operating on October 23, 2005 as part of the Greater Baltimore Bus Initiative, a plan of then-governor Robert L. Ehrlich for streamlining and simplifying the Baltimore transit system. Unlike a rail line, this addition did not require any construction. The bus route was intended to resemble the proposed Red Line that is currently being studied for the Baltimore region.Michael Dresser (June 9, 2009), Sweeping revision of bus routes proposed Harford Courant, retrieved 2009-12-15 When it started operating, Route 40 ran from Security Square Mall to the Essex Park-and-Ride lot on Eastern Avenue. Weekday service operated every 10 minutes during rush hour and midday. On February 5 the following year, it was extended to Middle River and reduced to one bus every 12–15 minutes.MTA February 2006 schedule changes On June 10, 2007, the eastern layover was moved to a safer location at Old Eastern and Vincent Avenues. The western layover was moved to CMS on February 8, 2009 and the stop at Security Square Mall was moved from the parking lot of the mall to a point along Security Boulevard adjacent to the mall lot. ==Quickbus 40 PLUS Service== Enhanced service for West Baltimore residents on the QuickBus 40 will begin October 25th, 2015. The enhanced service will increase frequency and reliability on the line between the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid in Baltimore County and City Hall in Baltimore City. Customer will find additional bus trips added on west side between CMS and City Hall to enhance off-peak and weekend access to jobs. ==Criticism== Route 40 received a lot of criticism following its inauguration from riders, politicians, and the media.Michael Dresser (October 25, 2005), Commuters ride out bus system's changesLos Angeles Times, retrieved 2009-12-15 This criticism resulted in some changes being made to the route, schedule, and other details. The service, which was projected to have a daily ridership level of 27,000, fell far short of that goal. Many riders waiting for other buses at common stops complained about seeing a lot of empty Route 40 buses. This resulted in its weekday frequency being reduced. Low ridership and unrealistic time allocation initially being built into the schedule resulted in poor on-time performance and buses clumping together. As one bus fell behind schedule while busy picking up passengers, the one behind it got ahead after stops had been cleared of waiting passengers, and ultimately caught up to the earlier bus. This left larger gaps between buses. Financial resources needed in order to operate this service were obtained by cutting back on the amount of local bus service along common streets of operation, mostly on Route 23, which had its level of service cut by nearly 50% when Route 40 was introduced. This brought the number of local buses on these busy streets below the demand. The service's original route had an eastern terminus at Essex Park-and-Ride lot, which was more than a mile short of the transfer point for some other lines, including Routes 24 and 55. An extension in February 2006 to Middle River allowed riders to transfer directly to those routes. On the west side of the route, there is no designated Park-and-Ride lot allowing motorists to park their vehicles and catch the bus. Security Square Mall has not allocated any spaces for riders of Route 40, and an existing park-and-ride lot at the end of I-70 is not within a practical or pedestrian friendly walk of a bus stop. While rapid transit lines are generally modeled for commuter purposes, QuickBus is marketed only to those who do not own vehicles and depend on a neighborhood bus stop. ==Tracking of buses== At 11 stops along the route, a new experimental system was installed late in 2006. Electronic signs at these stops, tied into a GPS system, indicate the expected time of arrival for the next bus, so riders do not have to rely on a less reliable printed schedule. MTA is considering implementing this system at many more bus stops along other routes in the future.Stephanie Wentworth (December 20, 2006), MTA to track bus arrival times with satellite system Baltimore Business Journal, retrieved 2009-12-15Maryland Transit Customers to get Real-Time Information at Bus Stops Government Technology (December 21, 2006), retrieved 2009-12-15 This system has been highly criticized. It is expensive, and money spent on it has not been spent on improving bus service around the Baltimore area. Even when fully in place, these signs will only be found at a small percentage of bus stops, and will not be useful to everyone. ==QuickBus Structuring== On December 21, 2006, Bus Route 40 was rebranded as \\"QuickBus\\" in order to better promote the service.MTA Announces \\"QuickBus\\" Service on 40 Line; Bus Restructuring Put on Hold, BTA Updates (January 30, 2007), Baltimore Transit Alliance Special pylons were added at selected stops to mark the locations. The name \\"QuickBus\\" was synonymous with Bus Route 40 until August 30, 2009, when another QuickBus line, known as Route 48, started operation along the Greenmount Ave/York Rd corridor.Summary of Bus Service Modifications Effective Sunday, August 30, 2009 MTA Maryland website, retrieved 2009-12-15 The MTA had added two more QuickBus lines: Route 46 and Route 47 on August 29, 2010.Notice of Public Hearings, June 2010.

The film is notable for having an uncredited Ed Wood as the author of its screenplay. ==Plot== Paula Parkins, the spoiled daughter of a well-to-do newspaper editor father and a socialite mother, gets her kicks by organizing and directing a gang of bored young women like herself. The gang dresses in men's attire, robs gas stations, and terrorizes habitués of a local lovers' lane—even raping a young gentleman (off camera) after tying up his girlfriend. As a newspaperman, Paula's father has some inside information on police plans to capture the gang, so the girls are able to avoid capture with Mr. Parkins' unwitting complicity. After a make-out party with a few local gangsters, Paula and her pals agree to wreck a few classrooms — and destroy the American flag — in a public school at the behest of Sheila, a female crime boss. (It is implied that this is part of an anti- American Communist plot.) The girls perform the job with gleeful competence until the police arrive and a deadly shootout takes place, claiming the lives of two of Paula's gang while Paula shoots and kills a policeman. Seeking refuge from the police, the girls return to Sheila's to demand their payment for wrecking the school. But Sheila, not wanting to be involved or arrested for their crime, starts to call the police until Paula fatally shoots her. While leading the police on a car chase, Paula crashes the car into a store's plate-glass window, injuring her and killing her last gang member. Paula is captured and convicted, then dies in the hospital giving birth to the child she accidentally conceived. The judge in Paula's case denies her parents custody of their granddaughter, based on the neglectful way they raised Paula. The cynical tag line \\"So what?\\" is used repeatedly by the girls to underscore their uncaring, nihilistic attitude. ==Cast== * Jean Moorhead as Paula Parkins * Barbara Weeks as Jane Parkins * Arthur Millan as Carl Parkins * Theresa Hancock as Georgia * Glen Corbett as Barney Stetson * Joanne Cangi as Geraldine * Gloria Farr as Phyllis * Lee Constant as Sheila * I. Stanford Jolley as Judge Clara * Timothy Farrell as Lt. Holmes * F. Chan McClure as Det. Artman * Bruno Metsa as Manny * Harry Keaton as Doctor ==Production== *The screenplay, originally titled Teenage Girl Gang, was written (without billing) by Edward D. Wood, Jr., the director of Glen or Glenda and Plan 9 from Outer Space. The Violent Years was the most financially successful film with creative input from Ed Wood. *Star Jean Moorhead was the Playboy Playmate for October 1955. The film's working title was \\"Teenage Killers\\".The Violent Years TCM Notes Although the opening credits indicate that Headliner Productions copyrighted the film in 1956, it is not included in the Copyright Catalog.The Violent Years TCM Notes The Violent Years was actually based on the story by Roy Reid. ==Critical Reception== Film historian Leonard Maltin savaged the film: \\"Tawdry and preachy, with wooden-Indian acting all around...Fans of the one, the only, Ed Wood are in for a treat; however, if it's Another Clockwork Orange you're expecting, bring plenty of salt!\\" ==In popular culture== The industrial metal band Ministry incorporated many lines of the film's dialogue in their song \\"So What\\" from the 1989 album The Mind Is a Terrible Thing to Taste. Long stretches of the judge's monologue are used in two different parts of the song (\\"you have had all that money can give you...\\", \\"kill for a thrill\\", etc), as well as multiple characters' readings of the song's titular line. The film was mocked on a 1994 episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000 (Season 6, Episode 10). Subjects for jokes included the occasionally wooden acting, the same car-on-road shots being repeated, and the judge's rambling closing monologue. ==Home media== The film was released on VHS several times, including a release under Rhino's \\"Teenage Theater\\" banner- hosted by Mamie Van Doren. The film received several DVD releases of varying quality, one from Something Weird Video, as part of the Ed Wood box set 'Big Box of Wood, and the box set of vintage exploitation films called Girls Gone Bad. In 2017, the film was released on Blu-ray through a partnership by Something Weird Video and the American Genre Film Archive (AGFA) including a commentary track from Frank Henenlotter and Rudolph Grey. ==See also== *List of American films of 1956 *Girls with guns *Ed Wood filmography ==References== * The Haunted World of Edward D.

The company offered a variety of women’s clothing in misses, petite and women’s plus sizes. ==HistoryFrom startup to profitability (1984 to 1986)=== In 1984, Dennis and Ann Pence relocated from Manhattan to the resort town of Sandpoint in northern Idaho to start a direct mail business. They bootstrapped the business with savings of only $40,000. Early catalogs were printed in one color by the local newspaper. In the early days the two founders did everything, putting an extension cord on their telephone so they could take customer orders throughout the tiny condo they worked from. The first four-color catalog, called Northcountry, was published in 1985. Writing and design were handled in house, leveraging Ann's background as a Copy Director for Macy's. Northcountry took a very unusual approach, showing apparel without models and describing product with very colorful prose. By 1986 the company had achieved profitability and had fewer than 10 employees. ===Rapid sales growth (1987 to 2006)=== By 1990, millions of catalogs were being mailed to its own customers and rented mailing lists. In 1991 and 1992 major investments were made in upgrading computer systems and new executives were hired to help manage growth. In 1991 revenues had reached approximately $11 million delivering a profit of $1.6 million. Sales were $18.8 million in 1992. In 1993 the company launched a second catalog title, called Spirit of the West. A third catalog title, Ecosong, was added in 1994 along with the Coldwater Creek Credit Card. Between 1994 and 1996 the company invested heavily in information technology along with distribution and call center capacity. A new call center was opened in Coeur d'Alene, ID. In addition, the company's first retail store was opened in Sandpoint, ID. The company achieved sales of $75.9 million and earnings of $5.6 million in 1995. In its 1996 earnings release CEO Dennis Pence said \\"This year marks the sixth consecutive year of growth for the Company....\\". Sales grew 88.5% from the prior year, coming in at $143.1 million. Net Income was $7.7 million.http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/coldwater-creek-inc-reports- year-end-and-fourth-quarter-results-sales-and-net-income- increases-75052167.html The company launched a fourth catalog title, Milepost Four, targeting men. The title was sold to another company a few years later. In 1997 the company raised $37.5 million through an IPO. Dennis and Ann Pence retained 75% ownership of the company. By that year 10% of the company's sales were coming from Japan and Canada. Sales for the year grew by a torrid 72.4%, reaching $246.7 million. Net income came in at $11.7 million.http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/coldwater-creek-announces- year-end-and-fourth-quarter-results-77212972.html Annual sales in 1999 hit $328.3 million and net income was $13.7 million (excluding costs associated with selling Milepost Four). At the end of the fiscal year the company had begun the rollout of a new catalog title, Natural Elements. Management was very focused on growing its internet business this year, stating \\"Coldwater Creek's objective is to derive 25% of its revenue through its e-commerce site by the end of fiscal 2000. Moreover, management's goal is to obtain a 5% market share of the US on-line market for women's apparel sales during fiscal year 2000\\" in its year end earnings release.http://www.prnewswire.com/news- releases/coldwater-creek-1999-fiscal-year-eps-increases-265-company-launches- natural-elements-line-plans-internet-and-retail-expansion-72452832.html The company also opened a new call center and distribution center in Parkersburg, WV to keep up with growth during the year. In 2001 Georgia Shonk-Simmons took over as CEO. Dennis Pence returned to the position after a year and a half in September 2002. From 2002 to 2004 the company focused on opening new retail stores, going from 41 in 2002 to 114 in 2004. By 2003 the company delivered sales of $473.1 million and $9.15 million in profit. Sales were $518.8 million in 2004, up 9.7% from the previous year. Net Income was $12.3 million. In May 2004 the company raised $41 million in a secondary stock offering.https://ipomonitor.com/quarterly-review.html/report/71 Growth accelerated in 2005, with sales up 13.8% to $590.3 million with an also growing profit of $29.1 million. With the goal of increasing the percentage of its direct sourced merchandise from 15% to 30%, the company opened an office in Hong Kong during the last fiscal month of the year.http://seekingalpha.com/article/10305-coldwater-creek- inc-q4-2005-earnings-conference-call-transcript-cwtr?page=5 The company also began a 350,000 square foot expansion of its distribution center in Parkersburg, WV in the fourth quarter of 2005.http://seekingalpha.com/article/10305-coldwater-creek- inc-q4-2005-earnings-conference-call-transcript-cwtr?page=2 In 2006 the company experienced massive growth, with sales increasing by 32% to $779.7 million paired with $41.6 million in net income. The same year the company opened 6 test spa locations, referred to as Coldwater Creek ~ The Spa.http://www.wikinvest.com/stock/Coldwater_Creek_(CWTR)/Filing/10-Q/2006/F4920557 ===$1 billion mark reached but losses begin (2007 to 2013)=== In October 2007 Dennis Pence retired as CEO once again, succeeded by Daniel Griesemer.http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/coldwater-creek-co-founder- chairman-and-ceo-dennis-pence-announces-plan-to-retire-as-ceo-58414117.html 2007 revenue exceeded $1 billion for the first time growing 35.2% from the prior year. This would be the last profitable year as a public company, with net income of $55.3 million. At the end of 2007 the company had 306 premium retail stores, up from 239 at the end of the previous year, a net increase of 67. In the year end earnings call, management indicated that \\"the chain target is somewhere between 500 and 550 stores\\". 2008 was Dan Griesemer's first and only full year as CEO of the company. Annual revenue hit an all-time high that year, coming in at $1.15 billion but the company lost $2.5 million, the first annual loss since 1985. The company ended the year with a strong balance sheet, with $81 million in cash.http://seekingalpha.com/article/124187-coldwater-creek- inc-q4-2008-earnings-call-transcript A big focus for management was to \\"remain focused on further reducing our cost structure and preserving our cash as business conditions warrant.\\" $30 million in SG&A; expense reductions were identified and capital expenses were reduced significantly from the previous year heading into 2009.http://seekingalpha.com/article/124187-coldwater-creek- inc-q4-2008-earnings-call-transcript?page=2 In September 2009 Dennis Pence returned as CEO, saying in a statement that he was named CEO to bring the company a \\"return to profitability\\". Revenue for 2009 reached $1.04 billion, with net loss $56 million for the year. 2010 continued to be challenging, with revenue dropping to $981 million paired with a net loss of $44.1 million. In May 2010, Georgia Shonk Simmons retired as President and CMO, replaced by Jerome Jessup. The strength of the business continued to deteriorate, with revenue dropping to $773 million in 2011. The company's net loss for the year grew to $99.7 million. In July 2012, seeking to shore up a weak cash balance, the company secured a $65 million loan from Golden Gate Capital.http://www.chainstoreage.com/article/coldwater-creek-announces-new- financing-golden-gate-capital Prior to the end of 2012, which would produce further erosion in revenue at $742 million for the year and a loss of $81.8 million, Dennis Pence once again retired. Jill Dean was promoted from her position as Chief Merchandising Officer to President and CEO. 2013 was another tough year despite the change in leadership. In October of that year the company announced restructuring aimed at cutting $20 to $25 million in expenses. It eliminated close to 100 jobs, including its number 2 executive, Jerome Jessup. Revenue dropped to $742 million and the company lost $81.8 million. The company's cash position had dropped to $21.7 million. ===2014 bankruptcy and change of control=== On April 11, 2014, Coldwater Creek announced that it was filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, listing $278.5 million in assets and $361.3 million in debt. In a statement the company said that it had “engaged in a thorough analysis of all potential alternatives” but had failed to find a buyer or a source of funds to support continued operations. As of the bankruptcy announcement the company employed 339 employees at its corporate headquarters and 5,500 others elsewhere. Plans were made to start liquidating inventory and assets. Operations ceased as of early summer 2014. ===Revival and second closure (2014-2020)=== In June 2014, Sycamore Partners, owner of brands including Talbots, Nine West, and Stuart Weitzman, purchased Coldwater Creek’s intellectual property (use of the name, logo and customer list) through CWC Direct LLC, and opened new headquarters in Hingham, Massachusetts. On November 3, 2014, Coldwater Creek was relaunched as a catalog and online-only retailer. In early 2018, a new Coldwater Creek store opened in Burlington, Massachusetts, the company's first brick-and-mortar store in three years. As of February 2020, the company operated thirteen physical retail stores, all located in the United States. On July 20, 2020, Comenity Bank, holder of the Coldwater Creek credit card program, sent an email to borrowers that Coldwater Creek intended to cease all business operations in \\"August 2020.\\" In the email, Comenity told borrowers, \\"Coldwater Creek has informed us that any Coldwater Creek merchandise purchased on or after July 6, 2020, will be final sale and not eligible for returns.\\" On the same day, the company's website read: \\"It's time to say goodbye. Every brand has a story, and ours has taken an unexpected turn.\\" The closure of the website also included the permanent closure of the company's 13 retail locations, most of which had not re-opened since shutting down for the COVID-19 pandemic. In September 2020, Coldwater Creek 's assets sold $12.2 million deal to Hong Kong procurement company Newtimes Group. ==Notes== Category:Clothing retailers of the United States Category:Clothing brands of the United States Category:American companies established in 1984 Category:Retail companies established in 1984 Category:Companies based in Plymouth County, Massachusetts Category:Hingham, Massachusetts Category:Companies that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2014 Category:2014 mergers and acquisitions Category:1997 initial public offerings Category:Companies formerly listed on NASDAQ ","title":"Coldwater Creek"},{"id":"9077958","text":"Presidential elections were held in Senegal on 27 February 2000, with a second round taking place on 19 March after no candidate won over 50% of votes in the first round.

The building stands on a public square in the city's downtown commercial district. The current structure was completed in 1891 and was preceded by two other buildings, one of which was destroyed by a group of outlaws. Following the destruction of the courthouse, the county was without a judicial building for a period during the 1840s. The Ogle County Courthouse was designed by Chicago architect George O. Garnsey in the Romanesque Revival style of architecture. The ridged roof is dominated by its wooden cupola which stands out at a distance. In addition to the courthouse building, the public square contains several outbuildings and sites that are also historic in nature and considered contributing properties to the Oregon Commercial Historic District, including a sculpture by Lorado Taft and a cast-iron fountain. The courthouse joined the Register in 1981 and was included as a contributing property to the historic district in 2006. After initially joining the Register the structure underwent a careful restoration. The courthouse no longer serves as the primary judiciary center for the county; its successor is located directly across the street. ==History== Ogle County Courthouse has been the name of three buildings. The current structure on the public square, no longer in use as the judiciary center in Ogle County, was constructed in late 1890 and early 1891 at a cost of US$107,000.Ogle County Courthouse , Attractions, City of Oregon. Retrieved 1 February 2007. The basically square Romanesque Revival structure is topped with a cupola and features a full basement. It was designed by Chicago architect George O. Garnsey.National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form, (PDF) Ogle County Courthouse, HAARGIS Database, Illinois Historic Preservation Agency. Retrieved February 1, 2007. ===First courthouse=== The first session of the Ogle County Commissioners' Court took place on January 3, 1837, after the city of Oregon was picked as the county seat.Ogle County Quick Facts, Ogle County, Illinois, Official site. Retrieved March 9, 2007. The first courthouse was completed in 1840–1841, but it never saw use. The 1840-41 courthouse was constructed at a cost of $4,000, partially in response to \\"a gang of villains\\" harassing citizens. On March 21, 1841, the night before court convened in its new building, the bandits allegedly set the courthouse on fire, completely destroying it. The town, whipped into a fury by horse whipping and thievery and, even murder, later formed a band of \\"Regulators\\" to hunt down and bring the bandits to justice. Essentially vigilantes, the group tracked down two residents, \\"Old Man Driscoll\\" (possibly Driskell) and his son, William Driscoll, both suspected of the murder. The Driscolls were arrested and brought to Oregon by the Regulators. A trial was organized at a nearby mill. The defendants were provided with counsel and the trial ensued, which residents involved called \\"fair\\" at the time. The swift outcome of the trial resulted in the almost immediate execution of the two men. One Driscoll, led out alone, was shot first. Then the other was led out, shown his dead relative's body and pushed for a confession. The defendant refused to confess, though he reportedly said he had committed other crimes for which he deserved death, and was also shot. After the lynching, friends and relatives of the Driscolls attempted to strike back at the Regulators. They obtained an indictment against many of the Regulators charging them with murder. The Regulators responded by obtaining their own Bills of Indictment against every person who had stood by and witnessed the lynching. With 125 people under indictment no witnesses could be found, and no jury could be formed, so the judge cleared the charges. ===Courthouse limbo=== Builders added the striking cupola in 1892, after the courthouse's dedication.For several years, between the March 1841 arson and 1848, court convened in various private residences. Without a courthouse in Oregon, the county seat, proposals to move the county seat began to circulate. Ogle County communities, Byron, Mount Morris, Grand Detour and Daysville were all in contention for the designation, and, ultimately, the new courthouse. At the deciding meeting the representatives from Daysville removed their town from the running and sided with Oregon. The withdrawal of Daysville gave Oregon a slim majority of votes and it retained its status as county seat of Ogle County. ===Second courthouse=== The replacement for the first courthouse, destroyed by arson, was not completed until the summer of 1848. A one-story brick building, the second Ogle County Courthouse was constructed for $3,000. The county used it for several decades but it was soon outgrown as various county offices began to accumulate more and more records and files. The structure exhibited Greek Revival style, common at the time. Some of the 1848 building's architectural elements included, a vent cupola, double-hung sash windows, complete with shutters, a gabled front roof and corniced returns. The new building was used as a multi-purpose public building; besides being the courthouse it served as the meeting hall for the Evangelical Lutheran Congregation of Oregon until 1850. When community leader Henry Mix died in 1867 citizens gathered at the courthouse to mourn. Though the 1848 Ogle County Courthouse was soon found to be \\"inadequate in every respect\\" it would be over 40 years before a new facility was built. The idea of a new courthouse was met with staunch opposition and it was not until 1891 that the 1848 building was demolished and the current building erected. ===Third courthouse=== The current old courthouse in Ogle County was completed in 1891 and has been in constant use since. It was dedicated on August 20, 1891 and remained the county's primary judicial building until the same date 114 years later, in 2005. On that day Ogle County dedicated its fourth courthouse, across the street from the historic old courthouse. The 1891 courthouse was completed at a cost of slightly more than $100,000. It is constructed of red brick and detailed with Naperville and Ashton limestone in a rock-faced motif. Architect George O. Garnsey, who also designed the Ellwood House in nearby DeKalb County, designed the building in the Romanesque Revival style. The cupola was not added to the roof until 1892. During its early years, the courthouse was a popular community meeting place; the courthouse lawn was a common setting for community events and gatherings. Today, events no longer regularly take place on the courthouse lawn, but some festivals still occur at the location. After being listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1981 a series of renovations began on the building, in order to, \\"preserve its historical and architectural integrity.\\" Inside the courthouse, each office and courtroom was renovated, the exterior of the structure was refurbished and restored as well. The work was completed in 1983 and the building opened for public tours in 1984. ==Architecture== The facade of the building is constructed of red brick, accented with limestone detailing. This example of Romanesque Revival architecture was designed by George O. Garnsey, a Chicago architect well known in northern Illinois. An impressive structure, the courthouse is designed on a monumental scale. ===Exterior=== The building is constructed of red pressed brick, detailed with locally quarried limestone, and reinforced with steel girders. The building's primary contractor was C.A. Moses. The red brick facade is detailed with significant amounts of limestone, including in its continuous lintels and sills. The entrances are covered with large round arches. The full basement is hinted at by the building's prominent foundation and water table. The window lintels, and sills, as well as the arches and stairs are trimmed with limestone. The roof is sharply angled toward its center, where a wooden cupola tops the building. It was completed after the building, in 1892. At each of the square shaped building's four corners are dormers, which serve to break up the monotony of the otherwise ridged roof. The dormers resemble the cupola, in that they are dormered as well as multi- gabled. The roof has had routine maintenance performed as required. The building's dominant feature, its cupola, sits on an oversized brick base with a terra cotta belt around its base top. It features blocked openings with multiple arches, double round arches, Corinthian pilasters, and organic corner detailing. The courthouse is elaborately windowed. Some windows, mostly on the first floor are straight topped. On the second floor most of the windows are topped with limestone arches. The original, wood-framed windows were replaced in 1972. The building's two main entrances feature stone arches over recessed doors; eleven step stairways lead to both doors. New doors were installed in both entrances in 1971. ===Interior=== The interior, first-floor lobby of the courthouse building. The remaining original woodwork, sills, door frames, and interior doors, are all solid oak. The interior walls are 12 inches thick and, either painted or covered with paneling. An open, double staircase leads from the first floor to the second and third floors and the center of the building houses an elevator which moves from the basement to the third floor. The interior floors are all white pine wood, though some of the floors have now been carpeted. First floor ceilings are 15 feet high, with doors at a height of 12 feet. The second floor features the courtrooms, which, through the 1980s remodel, had the ceilings lowered to 10 feet. The interior renovation was completed at a cost of US$1.5 million.15th Judicial Circuit, Illinois Courts, \\"Ogle County FYI,\\" 2007, State of Illinois.

Besides the courthouse, there are five other important sites on the public square, all of which are considered contributing properties to the historic district. The sites include cannons, war memorials, and a cast-iron fountain. Iron Mike, the 1896 cast-iron fountain, is on the south side of the 400 Block of Washington Street in the Oregon Commercial Historic District. The multi-tier fountain is set into a matte green concrete base, and is four feet tall and three feet wide, at its widest point. Its lowest tier is adorned with the words \\"Illinois Humane Society.\\" ===Civil War cannons=== The War Memorial on the courthouse square, a contributing property to the Oregon Commercial Historic District. The public square also features two surplus Civil War era cannons. The two cannons \\"guard\\" the eastern entrance to the Ogle County Courthouse. Both cannons were put in place sometime between 1898 and 1900. The Columbiad Cannon (the southernmost cannon) was cast in 1846 in Boston, Massachusetts. The northernmost cannon, the Parrot Cannon, was cast in 1864. ===The Soldiers' Monument=== The Soldiers' Monument sits on the southeast corner of the public square. The monument was designed by sculptor Lorado Taft in 1911 and Chicago architects Allen Bartlit Pond and Irving Kane Pond designed the structure that encompasses Taft's sculptures. The installation was dedicated in 1916. The monument is adorned with plaques honoring Ogle County's war dead from the American Civil War, Mexican War, War of 1812 and World War I, the last of which was added later. ===War Memorial=== The Ogle County Courthouse is easily visible from a distance. On the north side of the public square is a terraced concrete memorial dedicated to Ogle County veterans of wars other than those included on The Soldiers' Monument. Dedicated on June 29, 1950, the War Memorial is adorned with plaques representing five American wars, World War I, World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War and the Persian Gulf War. The plaques were added from 1951 to 1991. The memorial features four brick tiers topped with concrete caps, each cap holds a flagpole base. ==Significance== The Ogle County Courthouse was added to National Register of Historic Places on September 10, 1981. On August 16, 2006 its historic importance was reasserted when it was included as a contributing property in the Oregon Commercial Historic District's listing on the National Register. On its original National Register nomination form the building was cited as significant in the areas of \\"architecture\\" and \\"politics and government.\\" The courthouse has been called a \\"prized landmark,\\" and a site \\"that holds a special place of honor\\" in the city of Oregon. Three of the features on and around the courthouse grounds, Iron Mike, the War Memorial, and The Soldiers' Monument, all greatly contribute to the sense of time and place that the Oregon Commercial Historic District conveys. ==See also== *George O.

These moths are small to medium-sized (10–50 mm. in wingspan) and are broad-winged bearing some resemblance to the superfamilies Tortricoidea and Immoidea. The antennae are often \\"pectinate\\" especially in males, and many species of these well camouflaged moths bear raised tufts of scales on the wings and a specialised fringe of scales at the base of the hindwing sometimes in females only; there are a number of other structural characteristics (Common, 1990; Dugdale et al., 1999) . The position of this superfamily is not certain, but it has been placed in the natural group of \\"Apoditrysia\\" \\"Obtectomera\\" (Minet, 1991), rather than with the superfamilies Alucitoidea or Epermenioidea within which it has sometimes previously been placed, on the grounds that shared larval and pupal characteristics of these groups have probably evolved independently. It has been suggested that the division into two families should be abandoned (e.g. Holloway et al., 2001). ==Distribution== Copromorphoidea occur worldwide except the northwest Palaearctic region (Dugdale et al., 1999). ==Behaviour== Adults are night- flying and attracted to lights. Caterpillars live between joined leaves or fruits or bore within stems. The larvae pupate with the silken gallery or descend to the ground and make a cocoon covered in detritus (Dugdale et al., 1999). ==Larval hostplants== The hostplants include the gymnosperm genus Podocarpus and quite a wide range of dicotyledon families .

A person born again in Christ does not merit of his own virtue but the virtues of Christ are applied to his work. Therefore, it is God crowning his works. Congruent merit is the equivalent of condign merit but applied to an unregenerated person by the goodness of God. In the first case, God has obligated himself, by his promises to reward his son's merits in his children. In the second case, God bestows his merit to those who seek him in faith not from obligation but from mercy and love. In neither case is God obligated by the human. In the first case, God is obligated by his promises to those who love him. In the second, God is obligated by his love and mercy to his creatures who obey him. In some formulations of Calvinism, condign merit is not needed because Jesus' atonement is a congruent merit given by God. Condign merit supposes an equality between service and return; it is measured by commutative justice, and thus gives a real claim to a reward in the name of Christ. Congruous merit, owing to its inadequacy and the lack of intrinsic proportion between the service and the recompense, claims a reward only on the ground of equity. This early-scholastic distinction and terminology, which is already recognized in concept and substance by the Fathers of the Church in their controversies with the Pelagians and Semipelagians, was again emphasized by Johann Eck, the adversary of Martin Luther.(cf. Greying, \\"Joh. Eck als junger Gelehrter,\\" Münster, 1906, pp. 153 sqq.) The essential difference between condign merit and congruent merit is based on the fact that, besides those works which claim a remuneration under pain of violating strict justice (as in contracts between employer and employee, in buying and selling, etc.), there are also other meritorious works which at most are entitled to reward or honour for reasons of equity or mere distributive justice, as in the case of gratuities and military decorations. From an ethical point of view the difference practically amounts to this that, if the reward due to condign merit be withheld, there is a violation of right and justice and the consequent obligation in conscience to make restitution, while, in the case of congruous merit, to withhold the reward involves no violation of right and no obligation to restore, it being merely an offence against what is fitting or a matter of personal discrimination. Hence the reward of congruous merit always depends in great measure on the kindness and liberality of the giver, though not purely and simply on his good will. ==Criticism of condign merit== In his 1532 Commentary on the Sermon of the Mount, Martin Luther criticized Catholic doctrine concerning condign merit. He noted that while the reward one gains from condign merit is much greater than that of congruent merit, the sort of good works said to attain each type of merit is similar. Luther thought it did not make sense that the two types of merit could be gained by similar actions when the benefit of condign merit is so much greater than the benefit of congruent merit.Commentary on the Sermon on the Mount translated by Charles A. Hay, 1892, page 97 ==See also== * Atonement in Christianity * Justification (theology) * Merit (Catholicism) ==References== ==External links== * Merit Catholic Encyclopedia http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10202b.htm Category:Catholic theology and doctrine Category:Christian terminology ","title":"Condign merit"},{"id":"9078080","text":"An eagle-shaped fibula Eagle-shaped middle fibulae, worn in pairs by gothic women The gold patera Frontispiece of Alexandru Odobescu's Trésor de Petroasa (1889), by Henri Trenk.

Modern archaeologists cannot connect the hoard with such a glamorous name. The treasure was shipped to Russia in December 1916, as German armies advanced through Romania in World War I, and was not returned until 1956. An atomic analysis of the Pietroasele gold hoard has concluded that from the point of view of Ir/Au, Cu/Au and Ag/Au concentrations the three styles are clustered. At least from the iridium concentration data, the assumption of a Dacian provenance of the hoard raw material is highly improbable as also the hypothesis that Roman imperial gold coins were used for manufacturing Pietroasa artifacts is not in accordance with the elemental concentrations.Journal of Radioanalytical and Nuclear Chemistry, 240 (1999) 897 NUCLEAR ANALYSES OF THE PIETROASA GOLD HOARD, Viorel Cojocaru, Cãlin Besliu and Cristina Anton Manea ==See also== * Ring of Pietroassa * Treasure of Osztrópataka * Romanian Treasure ==Notes== ==External links== *Pietroasele treasure, at the National Museum of Romanian History *Illustrations *Coins depicting the treasure *A great gold eagle brooch *Vivid: Romania through international eyes, Tim Judy, \\"The treasure of the Pietroasa\\" Part I: December 2005 Part II: January 2006 Category:Goths Category:Germanic archaeological artifacts Category:Treasure troves of Late Antiquity Category:Archaeological discoveries in Romania Category:Art and cultural repatriation Pietroasele Category:1837 archaeological discoveries ","title":"Pietroasele Treasure"},{"id":"9078088","text":"Oregon station is a historic train station in the Ogle County, Illinois county seat of Oregon.

They also mutually recognize and accept each other's clergy, interpretation of the Bible, creeds, baptism, eucharist and ministry. “The Communion” invites other Churches in India to enter into full communion with the member Churches. ==Formation and history== The origins of CCI goes back to the independent internal Theological Commissions appointed by the Church of North India, the Church of South India and the Mar Thoma Syrian Church to explore ways and means to enhance cooperation amongst them and bear Christian witness, in India. This idea of the independent commissions was originally proposed by the Church of North India and accepted by the Church of South India and the Mar Thoma Church. The independent Theological Commissions later decided to work together as a Joint Theological Commission. The first meeting of the Joint Theological Commission was held in January 1975 at Madras, which discussed the questions on faith, orders etc. The Commission also explored the possibilities of manifesting the unity of the three Churches, in the ultimate fulfillment of the \\"Mission of the Christian Church\\", in India. During their third meeting in September 1976, the Joint Theological Commission passed the proposal for a new model of union for these three Churches, which was accepted and a new Joint Council was inaugurated in July 1978, at Nagpur. One of the recommendations of the Joint Council was a common name, under which the three Churches will function together. This question was discussed by the different Churches. The CSI suggested the name \\"Church of India\\". The CNI and the MTC did not accept it, as a new Church did not come into existence. The MTC came up with \\"The Council of Churches in Communion - C.N.I., C.S.I., M.T.C.\\", in order to express clearly the bond of unity realized by the full communion between these Churches. The Joint Council did not accept that, either. During the Joint Council meeting held at Charalkunnu, Kerala in November 1999, the name 'Communion of Churches in India' was unanimously recommended by all three denominations, to reflect their growth in unity, over the years. The new name was adopted and announced at the Joint Council Meeting held in Calcutta in November 2000. ==Purpose== The CCI: * Aims to serve as a common organ for visible manifestation of unity, witness and service. * Will assist the churches to address the issues affecting and threatening life. * Will focus on issues of peace, justice and integrity of creation. * Will explore new avenues to share and affirm God’s love through diakonia. * Will seek other churches in India to consider joining this union It has also appointed three commissions to explore the ways of working together: (1) Commission on Mission to find out the possibility of opening new mission centers in different language areas of India in cooperation with one another (2) Commission on Theological matters: to study the implication of closer relationships (3) Commission on Peace and Justice: to consider national and international issues pertaining to Justice and Peace and the response of the Church to such situations. ==Administration== * Most Rev.

Adolf Heinrich Anton Magnus Neuendorff (June 13, 1843 − December 4, 1897), also known as Adolph Neuendorff, was a German American composer, violinist, pianist and conductor, stage director, and theater manager. == Life Early years=== Born in Hamburg, Germany on June 13, 1843, Neuendorff emigrated with his father to New York City, United States in 1855. In New York, he studied music, violin lessons with G. Matzka and Joseph Weinlich, and lessons of piano, music theory and composition with Dr. Gustav Schilling. In 1859, he made his debut as a concert pianist at Dodworth Hall. In 1861, went on a tour around Brazil, playing the violin. ===Milwaukee=== In 1864, he returned to the United States, now living in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Here he was conductor of the orchestra at the German Theatre and chorus-master of Carl Anschutz's German Opera Company. Later he succeeded Anschutz as conductor. ===New York=== In 1867, he became music- director of the New Stadt Theatre in New York. It was here where he conducted the American first performances of Richard Wagner's Lohengrin, on April 3, 1871, and Die Walküre, on April 2, 1877. In 1872, he brought Theodor Wachtel to the United States, and, with Carl Rosa, gave a season of Italian opera at the Academy of music. In that same year, he also established the Germania Theatre in New York, of which he was manager for eleven years. During that time he was also organist of a church and conductor of a choral society. In 1875, he gave a season of German opera with Wachtel and Madame Pappenheim, conducted the Beethoven centennial concerts, and in 1876 he went to the first Wagner festival at Bayreuth as correspondent for the New Yorker Staats- Zeitung. In the 1878-79 season he conducted the New York Philharmonic Society in the absence of Theodore Thomas, who was away in Cincinnati.Thomas (1905), p. 150 The first American performance of Brahms's 2nd Symphony was given by the Philharmonic orchestra under Neuendorff's direction on October 3, 1878. On December 21, 1878, he conducted the same orchestra during the United States premiere of Tchaikovsky's Francesca da Rimini, Fantasy after Dante. For the 1879/80 season, Thomas returned from Cincinnati to New York, and was elected conductor of the Philharmonic well ahead of Neuendorff and Leopold Damrosch.Thomas (1905), p. 154 Neuendorff began to compose comic operas and operettas himself, most of which were written to librettos in German as well as in English. Besides, he translated German operas into English to be performed on Broadway, for example Franz von Suppé's Die Afrikareise. ===Boston=== Between 1884 and 1889, he lived in Boston, Massachusetts and on July 11, 1885, conducted the first \\"Promenade Concert\\" performed by the Boston Pops Orchestra at the Boston Music Hall. The first program included a novelty number titled An Evening with Bilse, which humorously tossed together scraps of Beethoven and Strauss, Wagner and Weber. Given that everything else on the program was European as well, the audience at the first \\"Promenade Concert\\" could not have imagined that it was launching a peculiarly American tradition. ===Vienna=== In 1889, he became the Director of soprano Emma Juch's Grand Opera Company. Two years later, he moved to Vienna, Austria with his wife, singer Georgina von Januschowsky, before returning to New York City where he died on December 4, 1897, aged 54. ===Works=== His compositions include two symphonies, operas, and numerous other instrumental and vocal works. *The Rat- Charmer of Hamelin/Der Rattenfänger von Hameln (opera, 1880) *Don Quixote (opera, 1882) *Prince Waldmeister (opera, 1887) *The Minstrel (opera, 1892) ==References== ==Bibliography== * * ==External links== * * Category:1843 births Category:1897 deaths Category:American classical pianists Category:Male classical pianists Category:American male pianists Category:American conductors (music) Category:American male conductors (music) Category:American classical violinists Category:Male classical violinists Category:American male classical composers Category:American classical composers Category:German emigrants to the United States Category:American expatriates in Austria Category:American opera composers Category:Male opera composers Category:Music directors of the New York Philharmonic Category:19th-century classical composers Category:19th-century conductors (music) Category:19th-century classical pianists Category:19th-century classical violinists Category:American male violinists Category:19th-century American pianists Category:19th-century American composers Category:19th-century male musicians ","title":"Adolf Neuendorff"},{"id":"9078168","text":"The Plutellidae are a family of moths commonly known as the diamondback moths, named after the diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella) of European origin.

He was the youngest of seven children, all of whom could speak only Welsh. Edwards' father was a quarryman who grew up with no education, being taught how to read and write by Edward's mother.Ibid., p. 9. She died when Edwards was eight, after a period of poor health. After her death, the family moved and Edwards' father remarried within a year. From the age of ten, Edwards went to the quarry at Penmaenmawr with his father, at least during his holidays from school.Ibid., pp. 12-14. He soon began to start working on a farm in Talybont near Bangor, where one of his brothers also worked.Ibid., p. 15. Even before he was eighteen, Edwards left for Tonypandy in the South Wales coalfields. He travelled by rail, via Chester, and became aware of the urban, English, middle-class world outside of North Wales. When he arrived in Trealaw, he found lodgings and a job as a dustman on the night shift at Clydach Vale No. 2 Pit in the Rhondda mines. Working at the mines, Edwards became familiar with various English-speaking migrants, and quickly picked up the language. Before Edwards arrived in the area, his cousin had been one of ten people killed in an explosion at Clydach Vale. Another cousin, with whom Edwards had become close friends, was killed in the Senghenydd colliery disaster: Edwards was a member of one of the rescue parties that recovered bodies, following the explosion.Ibid., pp. 17-19. Edwards joined the South Wales Miners' Federation (known as the Fed), but did not always involve himself with strike action. ==Military service and early career== Edwards went away to fight in August 1914, at the age of twenty-one. He returned from the Western Front in March 1918, severely wounded and made to spend months in hospital. In September 1918, he was discharged and spent the last weeks of the war teaching gas drill to new recruits. After returning to civilian life on 10 December 1918, he stayed in Aberfan for a week, before returning to Penmaenmawr quarry. He joined the Workers' Union and the Independent Labour Party. After representing the quarry workers in a case of pay, Edwards joined the Dockers' Union in around 1920, leaving the Amalgamated Union of Quarryworkers and Steelworkers, which represented most quarry workers. Edwards was dismissed from his job at the quarry, due to refusing to rejoin the quarryworkers' union after strike action.Ibid., pp. 20-40. In 1923, Edwards became secretary of the Penmaenmawr branch of the Transport and General Workers' Union, which allowed him to meet with other union leaders. In 1927, he was elected to Penmaenmawr council.Ibid., pp. 43-49. ==Later career== He was appointed the first chair of the Council for Wales and Monmouthshire in 1949. He was in favour of a Welsh Parliament but initially did not support the Parliament for Wales campaign in the early 1950s although later he did join the campaign. He opposed the decision to flood the Tryweryn valley to create a reservoir to service Liverpool. In 1956 he bought the Welsh-language periodical, Y Faner, in order to save it from liquidation. In 1958 he resigned from the Council for Wales and in 1959 he left the Labour Party to join Plaid Cymru although he returned to the Labour fold in 1965. He was the first President of the Welsh Language Society. He published two autobiographical volumes in his native Welsh, Tros y Tresi (1956) and Troi'r Drol (1963). He was also a poet. ==Personal life== In March 1920, Edwards married Margaret Owen, a Welsh-speaking woman from Rachub, Bethesda, Gwynedd.

Here, cups A and C are upright and B is upside down. The solvable version of the problem. Here, cups A and C are upside down, and cup B is upright. The three cups problem, also known as the three cup challenge and other variants, is a mathematical puzzle that, in its most common form, cannot be solved. In the beginning position of the problem, one cup is upside-down and the other two are right- side up. The objective is to turn all cups right-side up in no more than six moves, turning over exactly two cups at each move. The solvable (but trivial) version of this puzzle begins with one cup right-side up and two cups upside- down. To solve the puzzle in a single move, turn up the two cups that are upside down — after which all three cups are facing up. As a magic trick, a magician can perform the solvable version in a convoluted way, and then ask an audience member to solve the unsolvable version. ==Proof of impossibility== To see that the problem is insolvable (when starting with just one cup upside down), it suffices to concentrate on the number of cups the wrong way up. Denoting this number by W, the goal of the problem is to change W from 1 to 0, i.e. by -1. The problem is insoluble because any move changes W by an even number. Since a move inverts two cups and each inversion changes W by +1 (if the cup was the right way up) or -1 (otherwise), a move changes W by the sum of two odd numbers, which is even, completing the proof. Another way of looking is that at the start 2 cups are in the \\"right\\" orientation and 1 is \\"wrong\\". Changing 1 right cup and 1 wrong cup, the situation remains the same. Changing 2 right cups results in a situation with 3 wrong cups, after which the next move restores the original status of 1 wrong cup. Thus, any number of moves results in a situation either with 3 wrongs or with 1 wrong, and never with 0 wrongs. More generally, this argument shows that for any number of cups, it is impossible to reduce W to 0 if it is initially odd. On the other hand, if W is even, inverting cups two at a time will eventually result in W equaling 0. ==See also== *Water pouring puzzle an unrelated puzzle, typically using three cups or glasses of water ==References== * ==See also== *List of impossible puzzles *Puzzle *Recreational mathematics Category:Puzzles Category:Unsolvable puzzles ","title":"Three cups problem"},{"id":"9078245","text":"Metachanda is the sole genus in tribe Metachandini of moth subfamily Oecophorinae.

The cancellation of the ceremony resulted in protests at the school which gained national media attention, and an unofficial graduation ceremony was organized by the families of the class of 2009 at Hilliar Park the day after what would have been the official graduation ceremony, of which footage was aired on local television stations. ==Ohio High School Athletic Association State Championships== * Girls Volleyball – 2003 _Other School Facts_ Centerburg's academic team (quiz bowl) has been a perennial local power over the past 4 years, advancing to the regional tournament on a regular basis.

In 1928 he was appointed to the chair of dermatology and syphilology, becoming chief physician at the Hôpital Saint-Louis. For his achievements during World War I, he was awarded the French Croix de guerre. With Charles Lucien de Beurmann (1851-1923), he conducted extensive research of fungal diseases that included pioneer studies of sporotrichosis.

Drell was nominated by President George W. Bush on January 15, 2003, confirmed by the United States Senate, 99-0, on April 9, received his commission on April 10, and had his investiture ceremony on May 30. ==Biography== Drell was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, to Theodore Louis Drell, Jr. (1913–2006) and the late Mrs. Drell. The Drells had three other children, Theodore L. Drell, III, Robert L. Drell, and Barbara Drell Allen. Drell obtained both his Bachelor of Arts in anthropology and his Juris Doctor degrees from Tulane University and Tulane University Law School in 1968 and 1971, respectively. Drell served in the United States Army Judge Advocate General's office from 1971–1975, based part of the time in Columbus, Georgia. He entered private practice in Alexandria in 1975. Bush nominated him to succeed Judge F. A. Little Jr., of Alexandria. Like Judge Little, Drell was affiliated with the firm Gold, Weems, Bruser, Sues & Rundell prior to joining the bench. Drell has been active in state and local bar associations, and he assisted the state bar with attorney disciplinary matters. He was a board member of the Family Mediation Council of Louisiana from 1986-1992 and a member of the Rapides Parish Indigent Defender Board from 1987 to 1994. He served on a state task force on racial and ethnic fairness in the courts. He is a member of Kiwanis International. Judge Drell also devoted time on a pro bono basis to helping individuals suffering from Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. He counseled the Central Louisiana AIDS Support Services and AIDSLaw of Louisiana, Inc. In 1997, he received the Pro Bono Publico Award from AIDSLaw of Louisiana. Drell and his family are Episcopalian. ==Federal judicial service== Drell was nominated by President George W. Bush on January 15, 2003, to a seat on the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana vacated by Judge F. A. Little Jr. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on April 9, 2003, and received commission on April 10, 2003. He served as Chief Judge from 2012 to 2017. He assumed senior status on November 30, 2017. Though Drell is considered a conservative Republican – he donated $300 to defeated GOP congressional candidate Clyde C. Holloway even after Bush tendered the nomination – he drew the praise of one of the Senate's most liberal members, Democrat Patrick Leahy of Vermont. At the time of the nomination, Leahy, then the ranking member on the Senate Judiciary Committee, described Drell as \\"a lawyer’s lawyer, rather than a political or judicial activist,\\" a category in which Leahy placed many of Bush's district and circuit court nominees. ==Ending desegregation cases== Judge Drell has tangled with longstanding school desegregation lawsuits, filed in the 1960s, which brought area parishes under the scrutiny of the federal court to guarantee that the districts were working toward a racially unitary school system. Drell approved school campus and grade assignments for Natchitoches Parish. He also ended the desegregation suit against Rapides Parish in 2006 and against Grant Parish in 2007. He declared that both districts were in substantial compliance with applicable national civil rights laws and educational regulations. One of Drell's predecessors, Nauman Scott of Alexandria, had periodically monitored the Rapides and Grant parish systems for many years to seek compliance with federal law. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1947 births Category:Living people Category:Louisiana Republicans Category:People from Alexandria, Louisiana Category:Lawyers from New Orleans Category:Tulane University alumni Category:Tulane University Law School alumni Category:United States Army officers Category:American Episcopalians Category:Judges of the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana Category:United States district court judges appointed by George W.

This is a small family, with about a global total of 20 species described to date; some undescribed species are known or suspected to exist however. They seem to be of Australian origin, where they are most diverse, but range through the Wallacea to Southeast and South Asia, and into the Pacific to the Marquesas Islands.Clarke (1986), Herbison-Evans & Crossley (2010), ABRS (2011) ==Description and ecology== These moths are usually small (with wingspans around 1–2 cm/less than 1 inch) and brownish in color. They have large compound eyes, thread-like antennae, and prominent labial palps. The body is slender, and the legs bear large spines.. The amount of wing modification varies in this family. Some genera (e.g. Cenoloba, Oxychirota and Tanycnema) resemble plume moths (superfamily Pterophoroidea), hence the common name \\"false plume moths\\". Others have little- or almost unmodified wings, and in some cases (e.g. Tineodes) at a casual glance look like snout moths (family Pyralidae). The forewings may be simply drawn out to a slim point, or deeply divided into two narrow lobes. The hindwings are typically quite short, and may also be divided into two lobes.ABRS (2011) Feeding habits of the caterpillar larvae are not well known; while they all seem to feed on eudicots, there is no obvious preference for a particular lineage of these. Most Tineodidae larvae seem to be leaf miners as in closely related moth families. Those of Cenoloba obliteralis (and perhaps others) inhabit developing fruiit instead, where they eat the young seeds. ==Systematics and taxonomy== The relationships of this group are disputed, and they were in fact not even considered a possibly monophyletic lineage for long. Initially, these moths were believed to be unusual Pyralidae (snout moths) or Pterophoroidea (plume moths). Only in the late 19th century was their distinctness realized, yet they were not considered as a monophyletic group. Rather, the more unusual forms were treated as a distinct family Oxychirotidae. This was subsequently merged into the Tineodidae - which was originally established for the more conventional-looking false plume moths - when it became clear that the two groups are very close relatives. Tineodidae are here united with the many- plumed moths (family Alucitidae) the superfamily Alucitoidea. It may be that these two groups are actually polyphyletic with regard to each other, and merging Tineodidae into Alucitidae and/or redelimiting the groups is warranted. In the taxonomic scheme used here, the closest living relatives of the Alucitoidea are considered the Pterophoroidea, but this is somewhat disputed. This would mean that the strong similarities between e.g. Tanycnema and the basal plume moth genus Agdistopis are not a coincidence.Minet (1991), ABRS (2011) The alternative approach assumes the fruitworm moths (Copromorphoidea) are the closest living relatives of the Alucitidae, including the latter in an expanded Copromorphoidea with the fruitworm moths and the fringe-tufted moths (family Epermeniidae). In this scheme, the Alucitoidea do not exist, and the Tineodidae are included in the Pterophoroidea. Ultimately however, it is the affiliations of the Copromorphidae (which seem to be basal Obtectomera, somewhat more advanced than the others) which would decide which scheme to use.Minet (1991) ==Genera== The genera presently placed here, sorted alphabetically, are:Wikispecies (2010) * Anomima Turner, 1922 * Carcantia Walker, 1859 * Cenoloba Walsingham, 1885 * Epharpastis Meyrick, 1887 * Euthesaura Turner, 1922 * Euthrausta Turner, 1922 * Neoxychirota Clarke, 1986 * Oxychirota Meyrick, 1885 * Palaeodes Hampson, 1913 * Tanycnema Turner, 1922 * Tephroniopsis Amsel, 1961 * Tineodes Guenée in Boisduval & Guenée, 1854 ==Footnotes== ==References== :This article draws heavily on the corresponding article in the Bokmål-language Wikipedia. * .

From 1974 until 1989 the company specialized in the design and manufacture of fiberglass sailboats and it continues as a builder of motorboats. The company was founded by Leon Slikkers in 1974 and remained in business in 2019 as the parent company of Tiara Yachts. ==History== Slikkers had initially founded a motorboat manufacturing company, Slickcraft. He sold the company and the sale included a non-compete clause that precluded him from establishing another power boat manufacturing company for a period of some years. The agreement did not include sailboats, so Slikkers founded S2 Yachts in a newly constructed plant that included strict production efficiencies and quality control mechanisms. For instance the fiberglass hulls were constructed in a climate- controlled room and remained in their molds until the majority of the interiors had been fitted, ensuring minimum deformation of the hulls. The new company hired many experienced workers and also signed up experienced boat dealers to sell the product line. S2 Yachts started building power boats once the clause had expired in the late 1970s, as the Tiara Yachts line of boats. Tiara Yachts remained in business in 2019. Slikkers eventually bought back Slickcraft at a fraction of the price he had sold it for. Sailboat production ended in 1989, due to the downturn in the sailboat industry, but the company continued as a motorboat builder. In 1989 the company was contacted by the class association for the S2 7.9, a popular sailboat racing boat. The association asked if the design could be put back into limited production and the company agreed, with a stipulation of a minimum order of ten boats to restart production. Despite an effort by the association and the S2 dealership network to drum up orders, the ten boat minimum was not met and production was not resumed. Popular Sailing magazine termed this incident, \\"an unfortunate commentary on the sailboat industry\\" and noted it marked the end of sailboat production. The company had a good reputation for the quality construction of its sailboats, including good interior fit-outs. Practical Sailor noted \\"The S2s were well-built. Whereas other production companies frequently cheapened or upgraded models from year to year to find marketing niches, S2 made boats to sell near the high end of the production boat market, and kept the quality at a consistent level.\\" == Boats == Summary of sailboats built by S2: *S2 8.0 A 1974 *S2 7.0 1975 *S2 8.0 C 1975 *S2 6.8 1976 *S2 8.0 B 1976 *S2 11.0 A 1977 *S2 9.2 A 1977 *S2 9.2 C 1977 *S2 7.3 1978 *S2 7.9 1979 *S2 7.9 FK 1979 *S2 6.7 1980 *S2 6.7 FK 1980 *S2 11.0 C 1980 *S2 8.5 1980 *S2 10.3 1982 *S2 5.5 1982 *S2 6.9 1983 *S2 9.1 1983 *S2 8.6 1984 *S2 22 1985 *S2 27 1985 *S2 35 1986 *S2 35C 1986 ==See also== *List of sailboat designers and manufacturers ==References== ==External links== Category:Sailboat manufacturers Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1974 Category:1974 establishments in Michigan ","title":"S2 Yachts"},{"id":"9078492","text":"Santo Domingo Norte is a municipality of the Santo Domingo Province in the Dominican Republic.

This defect primarily affects skeletal muscle fibres and causes muscular weakness and/or hypotonia. Congenital myopathies account for one of the top neuromuscular disorders in the world today, comprising approximately 6 in 100,000 live births every year. As a whole, congenital myopathies can be broadly classified as follows: *A distinctive abnormality in skeletal muscle fibres on the cellular level; observable via light microscope *Symptoms of muscle weakness and hypotonia *Is a congenital disorder, meaning it occurs during development and symptoms present themselves at birth or in early life. *Is a genetic disorder. ==Classification Myopathies with inclusion bodies and abnormal protein accumulation=== Congenital myopathies with inclusion bodies and protein accumulation is a broad category, and some congenital myopathies that fall within this group are well understood, such as nemaline myopathy (see below). Typically, the development error in this category occurs when muscle proteins aggregate and build up in the sarcoplasm, which leads to muscle dysfunction. ===Myopathies with Cores=== 'Core myopathies' such as multicore myopathy and central core disease are characterized by sharply-demarcated areas devoid of oxidative enzymes NADH, SDH, and COX, in muscle fibres. ===Myopathies with Central Nuclei=== Myopathies with central nuclei, such as myotubular myopathy, involves an error in the gene involved in vesicle movement throughout the cell. This creates problems in vesicles reaching the plasma membrane with the cellular components necessary to fuse myoblast, a major step in the formation of the skeletal muscle. This creates structural problems throughout the skeletal muscle and in the Z line of the sarcomere, creating the weakness in the muscle. ===Myopathies with Fiber Size Variation=== Myopathies with varying fiber size, such as congenital fiber type disproportion, occurs when type 1 fibers, the slow twitch fibers involved in sustaining activity, are smaller than type 2 fibers, the fast twitch fibers involved in quick activity. Since smaller type 1 fibers is not associated with nemaline myopathy, the most common type of congenital myopathy, it has not been studied in as great detail as many of the others. However, the smaller type 1 fibers explains why patients typically can participate in activities for shorter periods of time, but struggle with extended activity. ==Cause== ==Diagnosis== There are rarely any specific tests for the congenital myopathies except for muscle biopsy. Tests can be run to check creatine kinase in the blood, which is often normal or mildly elevated in congenital myopathies. Electromyography can be run to check the electrical activity of the muscle. Diagnosis heavily relies on muscle pathology, where a muscle biopsy is visualised on the cellular level. Diagnosis usually relies on this method, as creatine kinase levels and electromyography can be unreliable and non-specific. Since congenital myopathies are genetic, there have been advancements in prenatal screenings. ===Types=== The conditions included under the term \\"congenital myopathy\\" can vary. One source includes nemaline myopathy, myotubular myopathy, central core myopathy, congenital fiber type disproportion, and multicore myopathy. The term can also be used more broadly, to describe conditions present from birth. Nemaline myopathy Nemaline myopathy was first described in 1963 and is the most common congenital myopathy. It is characterized by generalized muscle weakness and low muscle tone. In its severest form, affected babies often die from respiratory failure. To date, 9 gene mutations have been found to cause nemaline myopathy. 6 of the identified genes are associated with the actin filament, which is the basis for muscle contraction. Histologically, nemaline rods stain red with Gomori's trichrome and are mostly seen in the subsarcolemmal region of muscle fibres. Nemaline rods have also been observed in the intermyofibrillar region of muscle fibres and within the nucleus. Nemaline myopathy is an autosomal dominant and sometimes an autosomal recessive genetic disorder. Sporadic cases have also been described. Myotubular myopathy Myotubular myopathy, also known as centeronuclear myopathy, is recognized by pain during exercise and difficulty walking. People affected by this disease typically are wheel- chair-bound by middle adulthood, have weakness in the muscles involved in eye movement, nerve function disorders, and some form of intellectual disability. Myotubular myopathy is very rare, with less than 50 families currently affected. Genetically, myotubular myopathy can have two causes: autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive. When caused by a mutation in the DNM2 gene, the disorder is autosomal dominant, meaning it can be passed on by one mutated gene. When the mutation takes place in the BIN1 gene, the disease is instead autosomal recessive, and both genes must be mutated for the disease to be inherited. Autosomal recessive onset is most common. Central core disease Central core disease or central core myopathy was first described in 1956A NEW CONGENITAL NON-PROGRESSIVE MYOPATHY http://www.neurology.org/content/15/4/371.full.pdf and usually presents in infancy or early childhood as non-progressive mild proximal weakness that persists throughout life. Central core disease is believed to be more prevalent than currently reported, as it is hard to recognize and often misdiagnosed in early childhood. Central core disease has been found to be allelic with malignant hyperthermia, which is a life-threatening anesthetic reaction that causes a rise in body temperature, muscular rigidity and muscular breakdown, grossly elevated creatine kinase, and acidosis. Central core disease is caused by a mutation in the RYR1 gene. Congenital fiber type disproportion Congenital fiber type disproportion affects skeletal muscle, typically causing weakness in the shoulders, upper arms, thighs, and hips. Skeletal muscle is made up of two kinds of fiber, type 1 and type 2. In congenital fiber type disproportion, type 1 fibers are not only smaller but often more abundant than type 2 fibers. This leads to affected individuals being able to maintain an active lifestyle, though they usually have lower levels of stamina. Severity with this disease varies greatly, but people typically present symptoms by the age of one. Individuals do not usually worsen with time, and cases have even been reported of improvements. Multicore myopathy Multicore myopathy also referred to as minicore myopathy, is associated with small areas of decreased oxidative activities, resulting in areas that appear in this histology as “cores”. These appear through microscopy very similar to central core, however the cores are typically smaller in multicore myopathy. As with congenital fiber type disproportion, patients have a greater number of type 1 fibers. Overall, approximately half of diagnosed individuals report no progression of muscle weakness, while half report a very slow progression. Cylindrical spirals myopathy Cylindrical spirals myopathy is very rare with only 18 individual cases described as of 2013. The majority of cases are sporadic, and has been observed in only 3 families. It is characterized by the presence of cylindrical spirals as the main pathological finding in muscle biopsies. Cylindrical spirals are unusual membrane structures that have a spiral pattern. These membrane structures are seen during electron microscopic examination of the affected muscle. These structures merge into or are surrounded by tubular structures that resemble tubular aggregates. Tubular aggregates are abnormal accumulations of membranous tubules and have been observed in a wide variety of muscle diseases and originate from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Cylindrical spirals were first described in 1979 and were thought to be a non-specific reaction of skeletal muscle secondary to a metabolic disturbance or muscle fibre injury. The molecular basis of cylindrical spiral myopathy is currently unknown, however a genetic mutation affecting the sarcoplasmic reticulum in some patients seems likely, as SERCA1, calsequestrin, and RYR1 have been shown to bind to cylindrical spirals. Cylindrical spirals have also been shown to react with the mitochondrial enzyme succinate dehydrogenase, which suggests that cylindrical spirals originate from mitochondria. Phenotypes are quite variable, and manifestations can include weakness, abnormal gait, myotonia, cramps, and scoliosis. ==Treatment== Currently, there are no treatments for any of the congenital myopathies. Depending on the severity, there are different therapies available to help alleviate any pain and aid patients in performing varying activities. For example, many congenital myopathy patients are involved in physical or occupational therapy in an attempt to strengthen their skeletal muscles. Orthopedic surgery is usually necessary to correct skeletal deformities secondary to muscle weakness, such as scoliosis. Survival is typically determined by the level of respiratory muscle insufficiency. ==References== ==Further reading== * GeneReviews/NCBI/NIH/UW entry on Congenital Fiber-Type Disproportion == External links == Category:Genetic disorders by system Category:Myoneural junction and neuromuscular diseases ","title":"Congenital myopathy"},{"id":"9078538","text":"Forbes Creek is a U.S. Geological Survey.

Such an apparently relictual distribution might relate to the geological split of South America and Africa, but there is as yet no evidence for the age of evolutionary divergence of Neotropical and Afrotropical representatives; moreover, new genetic material would be needed for the South African taxon as well as the American genera Anurapteryx and Lonchotura for a modern molecular approach to this problem to succeed . ==References== *Holloway, J.D., Kibby, G and Peggie, D.

The village forms a northern outskirt of Guildford, in the civil parish of Worplesdon which can be considered the mother village of medieval date to the west. The Stoke Hill part of Stringers Common, Slyfield Industrial Estate and a Surrey County Council general waste transfer station to the south form the narrowest of its buffer zones to all sides, separating the Slyfield part of Guildford from the village. Between Jacobs Well and Burpham to the south-east and east lie the River Wey, Burpham Court Farm Park, the River Wey Navigation, and the A3, in that order. Other nearby settlements include Sutton Green (beyond which is Old Woking) to the NNE. ==History== The manor of Burgham Court (now reflected in the farmhouse of Burpham Court) owned most of the land on the east side of the parish until the early 20th century. It was a major source of poor relief and public works under the local vestry. Outskirts of the land remain common land not owned by the lord of the manor. The manor was handed down via lines of the interconnected Wintershull/Wintershall, Bassett, Unwyn, Windsor, Wolley and Wroth families from Thurstan le Dispenser at the time of the Testa de Nevill. Ultimately purchased in 1720, becoming part of the major landholdings of the Earl of Onslow who held it until the early 20th century. Jacobs Well was the site of a fatal aircraft crash on 25 October 1944. A USAAF C47 crashed in a field, killing its crew of four. A plaque, on the corner of Queenhythe Road and Clay Lane, commemorates the accident. ==Amenities== Aside from the green buffers to all sides, principally Whitmoor Common to the west, which is the largest, amenities include a scout hut and village hall. A visitor attraction within these buffers is the gardens of the Tudor Sutton Place, in the borough of Woking to the north-east. Boats are available for hire at Guildford Boatyard, and elsewhere, for use on the River Wey Navigation, which forms the effective boundary of the village to the east. Bowers Lock is to the east, accessible from Clay Lane, the road to Burpham. ==Religion== There is no church in the village, the nearest place of worship is St Peter's Church in Bellfields. The denomination is Anglican.Stoke Hill St Peter's Church - Bellfields ==Transport links== The village is on two significant through roads: the A320 from Guildford to Woking and the unclassified road, Clay Lane, that links Worplesdon to Burpham and the A3. The railway between Woking and Guildford, the Portsmouth Direct Line, marks the practical boundary of the village to the west, however the nearest stations are Worplesdon and Guildford.

Meyrick omitted a description, thus the family was a nomen nudum, until Thomas Bainbrigge Fletcher provided the first description of the family in 1929. In 1987 (the journal volume is dated to 1986, but this issue was published the following year) Antonio Vives Moreno published a revision of the family. Vives included seven species in two genera in the family (Pterolonche and the monotypic Anathyrsa), describing two new species and synonymising one species within the genus Pterolonche. He also published a new subgeneric classification for Pterolonche: the subgenera Agenjius and Gomezbustillus to classify respectively two species native to southern Andalucia and the northwestern Maghreb, and one species native to Sicily. In 1999 Ron Hodges classified the group as the subfamily Pterolonchinae of the family Coleophoridae, including eight species in two genera (still Pterolonche and Anathyrsa). His classification was based on morphology (as all other classifications had been constructed up until this time). Adults of Pterolonche inspersa In WikiSpecies in 2008, the Pterolonchidae mysteriously included: *Phthinostoma Meyrick, 1914 *Pterolonche Zeller, 1847 In Zhi-Qiang Zhang's 2011 attempt to number all the known animal species of earth, van Nieukerken et al., the authors of the section on Lepidoptera, followed the works of Vives in 1987 and Hodges in 1999 regarding the Pterolonchidae. They recognised the Coelopoetidae and Syringopaidae as distinct families. In their taxonomic interpretation, the family Pterolonchidae was circumscribed by Edward Meyrick in 1918, and comprised eight species in two genera. Plexippica had originally been described as an independent monotypic genus by Edward Meyrick in 1912, but the single species was moved to the genus Pterolonche by him in 1924 (making Plexippica a synonym of Pterolonche). Nonetheless the lone taxon found itself classified as a member of the Yponomeutinae subfamily of the Yponomeutidae family in the Yponomeutoidea superfamily under its old name. The species was then rediscovered in South Africa and described as the new genus Kruegerius by Vives in 1999, and was placed in the Pterolonchidae by him, but in 2011 Wolfram Mey re-recognised Plexippica, synonymised Kruegerius with Plexippica, moved the genus to the Pterolonchidae yet again, and described a new second species in the genus. Three years later, in 2014, a cladistic analysis by Heikkilä et al. added the genera Homaledra and Houdinia to the Pterolonchidae from the family Batrachedridae, moved the two enigmatic genera Coelopoeta and Syringopais from respectively the Elachistidae and the Deoclonidae as monotypic subfamilies within the Pterolonchidae, and two genera were included besides the type genus within a new subfamily Pterolonchinae: *Coelopoetinae (Hodges, 1978) **Coelopoeta Walsingham, 1907 *Pterolonchinae Meyrick, 1918 **Anathyrsa Meyrick, 1920 **Plexippica Meyrick, 1912 **Pterolonche Zeller, 1847 ***Pterolonche ***Agenjius Vives, 1987 ***Gomezbustillus Vives, 1987 *Syringopainae (Hodges, 1999) **Syringopais Hering, 1919 *Unplaced as to subfamily **Homaledra Busck, 1900 **Houdinia Hoare, Dugdale & Watts, 2006 ==Distribution== A drawing of Syringopais temperatella The genus Pterolonche is found around the Mediterranean Sea, occurring in Portugal, Spain (including the Islas de Cabreras), France, Italy (Sicily, Sardinia), Malta, Hungary, Romania, areas within the territory of the former Yugoslavia, Crete, Cyprus, Anatolia, Iraq (Kurdistan Region), Lower Egypt, eastern Tunisia, northwestern Algeria and northern Morocco. Anathyrsa is restricted to southern South Africa. The two Plexippica species are found in Southern Africa. Coelopoeta is native to western North America, from California to the Yukon. The only species of Syringopais, S. temperatella, is found on Cyprus, in Greece and the Near East from Israel and Turkey to western Iran. Two species of Homaledra are known from South America, and two are from North America. Houdinia is restricted to an area in the north of the North Island of New Zealand. ==Ecology== Both genera Anathyrsa and Pterolonche are nocturnal. In Pterolonche both sexes are attracted to lamps at night and are easy to collect. Syringopais temperatella imagoes are active both day and night in May in Turkey, and lay their eggs in the summer, with the caterpillars emerging in the winter and early spring. Homaledra builds elaborate feeding chambers of silk under which the caterpillars hide. Pterolonche inspersa larvae infesting the roots of a Centaurea species. Coelopoeta caterpillars mine in the leaves of Boraginaceae, which in one species creates a gall-like deformation. Homaledra feeds on the undersides of the leaves of palms. Houdinia mines in Restionaceae and Syringopais in grasses. ==Uses== Pterolonche inspersa was released as a biological control agent for knapweed, Centaurea diffusa, in Colorado, Montana, and Oregon in the mid to late 1980s, although there was no known establishment of the species in the United States initially, it has since spread to Idaho and British Columbia. Syringopais temperatella is sometimes a major agricultural pest of wheat and barley in Cyprus, Jordan, Iraq and Iran. ==References== See also Gelechioidea Talk page for comparison of some approaches to gelechioid systematics and taxonomy.

In the West End part to the south and in the Hampshire mostly forested part 19th century replacements of some of these exist. In the 1841 Census, there were only about 50 dwellings and 250 inhabitants within the boundaries of what is now known as Rowledge. Evidence on the ground is thin: no listed building is in the parish on the National Heritage list.OS Map with Listed Buildings and Parks marked Fir Grove House, later rebuilt as Frensham Heights by Charles Charrington, the brewer, and now a private school is in the southern part of the parish. A rather haphazard pattern of trackways and footpaths traversed the area which still exist today and formed the basis for the present-day road network. The coming of the railways to Farnham in 1848 and the development of Aldershot as the home of the British Army in 1854, resulted in an influx of wealthy businessmen and Army officers, and saw the construction of many large houses in the late Victorian era. Tradesmen and service providers established themselves. The area was important for hop growing, supporting the brewing industry in Farnham. The Parish Church of St James' was built in 1869 and the School in 1872. The Methodist Church was established in 1875 and a new building erected in 1886. By 1871, a recognisable centre to the Village was established, with a post office, shops, public house and transport links to Farnham. A Rowledge cricket team did particularly well at the original Oval at Holt Pound so as to reach the village final at Lord's Cricket Ground. Further development, particularly in the early 1900s, followed the established road network and gradually filled in the open fields, creating the present-day village. In 1914 the Village Hall was built and the Recreation Ground became the centre for local cricket. Tennis and Bowls Clubs were established in the 1920s and 1930s. Another surge in development took place in the 1960s and 1970s, including Rowledge's first and only, housing estate in 1972. ==Demography== Surrey County Council estimated that the population of this part of the ward comprises 1,578 people living in 599 households (based on the United Kingdom Census 2001), 66.7% of properties were detached, 88.5% of homes were owner-occupied and 1.5% were socially rented, 29.0% of households had dependent children and 59.3% of households had two or more cars/vans. ==Amenities and recreation== Rowledge's community includes its own small shopping area with a butcher, convenience store (containing a post office), cafe, hairdresser and garage, and a public house: The Hare & Hounds. Local societies, sports and social activities include the school's activities, Village Hall, St. James' Church, Methodist Church Hall, Rowledge Club and the Recreation Ground with a newly refurbished play-area. The village holds Rowledge Village Fayre annually on Spring Bank Holiday Monday at the Recreation Ground. Rowledge Village Fayre has a large number of attractions and raises a significant sum of money for charities. ==Community events and awards== There is a Village Hall used by a play-group and other groups for children. Adults are catered for with various activities. At weekends the Hall is hired for parties and celebrations. Meetings with neighbourhood police, Councillors and the MP take place there.

It was originally titled Strawberry Shake while it was serialized in the manga magazine Yuri Shimai, though the title was changed when the manga began serialization in Yuri Hime. The first bound volume was published on January 18, 2006 in Japan, and the second on January 17, 2009. Strawberry Shake Sweet's story involves two young talents named Julia and Ran, and their inability to express their romantic feelings for each other. Portions of this manga are presented in yonkoma (4-panel) format, but it makes up only a small portion of the overall story. ==Characters== ; :The sixteen-year-old main character of the manga. She is one of the top talents in the company \\"Shanghai Talent Limited\\". Because of that, she was initially jealous of Ran's potential, but eventually she falls in love with Ran. She can be very stubborn and difficult, much to the annoyance of her manager. She is sometimes prone to nosebleeds when Ran is nearby and offering kind yet unknowingly double-toned words. Because of her romantic ineptitude, her manager often refers to her as an idiot and incompetent. ; :Another member of Shanghai Talent Limited. She is also sixteen years old but much taller (towering at least 15 inches from Julia's own height). She is oblivious to Julia's feelings at the start as well as her own. She is very laid-back, sometimes to the point of appearing \\"out of it\\". Because of her inability to recognize her own feelings, as well as Julia's obvious infatuation with her, her manager often refers to her as an airhead. ; :Julia's manager. She knows about Julia's romantic feelings toward Ran, and is often less than pleased with the awkward situations that those feelings often cause. She is normally calm, but Julia's outgoing attitude frustrates her to no end. Kaoru is in love with her, but Saeki sees those feelings as a nuisance. She is twenty-seven years old. ; :Another member of Shanghai Talent Limited. She is a year younger than Julia and Ran. She is in love with Kaoru, but Kaoru prefers just teasing her endlessly. Haruna is easily embarrassed and occasionally becomes jealous of anyone who receives attention from Kaoru. ; :Julia's hairdresser. She is very easy-going and enjoys teasing people, especially Saeki and Haruna. She knows about Haruna's feelings for her, but her eyes are focused on Saeki. She takes great pride in her work. She once did the hair and make-up for the female band Zlay (a parody of Japanese band Glay). ; :The lead singer of Zlay. She is a proud yuri lover, and she instantly knew who was the object of Julia's affections. To the other characters, her love for girls can be a bit overbearing. She appears randomly throughout the manga, catching the characters off guard. She offers random bits of advice and can identify emotions of people by their \\"aura\\". ; :Another member of Zlay and Ryo's girlfriend. She is much calmer than Ryo and is sometimes annoyed by her girlfriend's flamboyant attitude. She is very straightforward with her opinions, sometimes to the point of brutal honesty. ; :She is twenty-five years old. She is also Saeki's Kouhai and a Saeki-wannabe. According to Zlay. she is someone who is in love with a senpai two levels above her, indirectly making a reference to Sudou's feelings for Saeki. Sudou denies it but Julia commented that \\"she's totally like that!!\\", as Sudou admits that her heart starts racing while she's thinking of Saeki. ==Manga== ==References== ==Further reading== * * ==External links== * Category:2003 manga Category:Ichijinsha manga Category:Romantic comedy anime and manga Category:Yonkoma Category:Yuri (genre) anime and manga Category:2000s LGBT literature ","title":"Strawberry Shake Sweet"},{"id":"9078734","text":"Richard Trevor may refer to: * Richard Trevor (bishop) (1707–1771), Bishop of St David's, Bishop of Durham * Sir Richard Trevor (politician) (1558–1638), Welsh landowner, soldier and politician ","title":"Richard Trevor"},{"id":"9078736","text":"Wrecclesham is a village on the southern outskirts of the large town of Farnham in Surrey, England. Its local government district is the Borough of Waverley. Wrecclesham recreation ground caters for cricket, football, rugby and tennis clubs. This is where Jonny Wilkinson and Graham Thorpe started careers in their professional sports, as well as many sportsmen of some generations before such as Billy Beldham and Vic Cannings. It was once in the estate of Henry of Westminster and Blois the powerful 13th-century bishop who owned the majority of the fertile portion of the land, in what was then Farnham and soon became the related parishes of Farnham and Frensham in Farnham Hundred.
