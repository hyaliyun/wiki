The population at the 2001 census was 2,965 people. ==History== The first mention of Lipetsk Polyana dates back to 1653. In March- April 1919, Soviet power existed in the village. In 1932, the organization of the HR Committee began to operate, whose first secretary was I. Perez. After the liberation of the Lipetsk Polyany from the Nazi occupiers (October 24, 1944), 23 residents voluntarily entered the Red Army, and 9 were part of the 1st Czechoslovak Army Corps. 2 of them were awarded with orders and medals of the USSR, 18 gave their lives in battles for freedom and independence of the Motherland. In the village there is a monument to fellow villagers, who died in the struggle against the Nazis.https://uk.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Липецька_Поляна In 1930, the Jewish population was 239. With the Hungarian occupation of the region in March, 1939, Jews were forcefully removed from their occupations. From 1940 to 1941, Jews from the village were drafted into forced labor battalions and others were drafted for service on the Eastern front, where most died. By 1941, the Jewish population had increased to 280 and Jewish families without Hungarian citizenship were expelled to Nazi occupied Ukrainian territory, to Kamenets- Podolski, and murdered there. The remaining Jews of Lypetska Polyana were deported to Auschwitz late May, 1944.https://kehilalinks.jewishgen.org/Lypetska_Polyana/ ==See also== *Zakarpattia Oblast ==References== Category:Villages in Zakarpattia Oblast Category:Carpatho-Ukraine Category:Villages in Khust Raion Category:Holocaust locations in Ukraine ","title":"Lypetska Polyana"},{"id":"61392883","text":"The South African presidential election of 1979 pitted the President of the South African Senate Marais Viljoen, backed by the ruling National Party, against the former United Party leader De Villiers Graaff, backed by the New Republic Party, and the Deputy Chancellor of the University of the Witwatersrand, Guerino Bozzoli, supported by the Progressive Federal Party.

The current incarnation of the alliance includes the New Right, and Tkuma, while The Jewish Home left the alliance on 14 July 2020. The list was created ahead of the September 2019 Israeli legislative election, in which Yamina secured seven seats in the Knesset. The alliance was expected to split on 6 October, with the New Right as its own faction while Tkuma and the Jewish Home will stay together, though the alliance continued to negotiate as a single bloc in the aftermath of the election. The meeting on 6 October was postponed, with some citing disagreements on whether Yamina should split, while others referred to it as a \\"technical\\" matter. The alliance did split on 10 October 2019, and re-formed on 15 January 2020 in the run-up to the 2020 Israeli legislative election. ==Background== On 21 July 2019, after not making it past the electoral threshold in the April 2019 Israeli legislative election, New Right leader Naftali Bennett decided to give leadership of the party to Ayelet Shaked. In her opening leadership speech, Shaked declared that she will seek to unite with the Union of Right-Wing Parties (URWP) and other right-wing parties. The following day, negotiations with the URWP began. The negotiations initially stalled, as URWP leader Rafi Peretz was unwilling to concede leadership of the list to Shaked, and disagreements arose over how many spots each of the three involved parties would receive on the list. Another subject that arose in the negotiations was whether the radical former URWP member Otzma Yehudit should be included in the new joint list. Sara Netanyahu (the wife of the prime minister) was recorded speaking with Rafi Peretz' wife, Michal Peretz, in an attempt to convince Peretz to retain his number one slot on the list; she was unsuccessful. It was also revealed that Benjamin Netanyahu was involved (despite his denial). The URWP and the New Right agreed to a joint run on 29 July 2019, with the New Right's Ayelet Shaked leading the joint list. As part of the agreement, the alliance declared that they would negotiate together to establish a right-wing government under Benjamin Netanyahu. On 22 April 2020, it was reported that Bennett was now \\"considering all options\\" for Yamina's political future, including departing from Netanyahu's government, which had just agreed to form a joint government with leader of the opposition Blue and White party Benny Gantz, and joining the opposition. Bennett was reported to be unhappy with the new coalition government's decision to hold back on the issue of judicial reform. In May 2020, Yamina announced that it would go to opposition. The day before, Peretz, the leader of The Jewish Home, had split from the party, and would be named as the Minister of Jerusalem in the Thirty-fifth government of Israel. On 17 May 2020, Bennett met with Gantz, who also succeeded him as Defence Minister, and declared that Yamina was now a \\"head held high\\" member of the opposition. ==Principles== Ayelet Shaked listed 11 principles that the Yamina list is determined to uphold: #Jewish Identity: We will work to strengthen the Jewish identity of the State of Israel, and to strengthen the connection of Israeli students to the Torah, the Land of Israel, and the Jewish religious heritage. #Nationality: We will act for the implementation of the Nation-state Law and the prevention of any harm to it, while continuing to ensure individual rights and equality for all Israeli citizens. #Unity of the land: We are the only party that opposes the establishment of a Palestinian state and any withdrawal from the territories of the Land of Israel. We will work to develop settlements throughout the country. #Sovereignty: We will act for the full and equitable application of national sovereignty and the rule of law to all citizens and residents of Israel, including the end of the military administration of Judea and Samaria and the application of Israeli sovereignty to the territories of Judea, Samaria, and the Jordan Valley. #Determination against terror: We will defeat terrorism with determination and without compromise, we will defeat Gaza border terrorism and end the allowances paid to terrorists by the Palestinian Authority. We will bring back the corpses of IDF soldiers and charge a price from Hamas for its actions, with total resistance to the release of imprisoned terrorists. We will act to assist disabled IDF veterans and the victims of the conflict. #Aliyah: We will work towards the implementation of a national Aliyah policy, which will promote Jewish immigration and remove unnecessary barriers to immigration. We will prevent illegal immigration of migrant workers to Israel and prevent the abuse of family re-unification policies. #Competition and liberty: We will promote competition to break up monopolies and cartels, open the economy to international competition, and reduce central planning in the economy. We will promote competition in the housing market, release land for construction, and implement taxation policies that will spur development. We will streamline regulation, reduce the regulatory burden on employers, which will encourage employment and productivity, and create a comfortable environment for a sharing economy and the high tech industry. #Right to work: We will reform the labor law so that unions can only represent all workers in a workplace if they have a majority of its workers unionized. We will implement mandatory government arbitration to solve labor disputes in essential government services and increase transparency in labor organizations. #Governability: We will strengthen the values of governability and democracy. We will strengthen the status of the Knesset as a legislative authority and restore confidence in the Supreme Court as the judicial authority, in accordance with the law. We will strengthen the status of elected officials in the face of the un-elected bureaucracy. #Social responsibility: We will enact economic and medical protection for the disabled and the elderly, while integrating people with disabilities in education, society, and the labor market. #Galilee and the Negev: We will strengthen the Galilee and the Negev with additional employment opportunities, housing, health care, tourism, culture, and transport. We will encourage capital investment and private initiatives that will strengthen human capital and allow families to settle and remain in the Galilee and the Negev. We will strengthen agriculture and the Labor settlements. Alongside these united principles, each party retains its own independent platform. Thus, the New Right represents the more \\"liberal\\" Religious and Secular right, The Jewish Home represents \\"mainstream\\" Religious Zionism, while Tkuma represents the more hawkish and Chardal Religious Zionists. ==CompositionCurrent=== {  - ! colspan=2 Name !

Initially a more comfortable seat and mini luggage bags were fitted to the Rivale, but the modified machine had rough steering reactions. This prompted a new frame to be designed to overcome the steering problems. During development the machine was nicknamed lo scooterone (the maxi-scooter) within MV. The machine is a product of MV’s British designer Adrian Morton, and pre- production models were available for the press to test in December 2014 between Casares and Ronda in Andalusia, Spain. It was officially released at the 2014 EICMA show. ==Technical detailsEngine=== The liquid cooled 800 cc engine, which was originally designed by Ezio Mascheroni for use in the MV Agusta F3, is the larger of the two \\"triples\\" produced by MV at this time. The engine has a counter rotating crankshaft, normally only found on GP machines, which counteracts the centripetal forces of the wheels allowing the bike to turn faster. A specific version of the engine has been produced for the Stradale. Bore and stroke dimensions of 79 mm and 54.3 mm are retained, as are the compression ratio and valve sizes. The inlet tracts have been reduced and only one injector per cylinder is fitted. This reduces peak power to 115 hp @ 11,000 rpm but gives a more tractable engine. Usable torque is available from 2,000 rpm. The machine is fitted with a hydraulic clutch, which reduces the width of the engine by 40 mm. A quickshifter and a ‘blipper’ downshifter are fitted to the 6 speed gearbox. ===Chassis=== As is usual on modern MVvs, the lattice frame is made from steel tubes with aluminium sections around the swinging arm pivots, but with increased rake and trail to improve stability. The single sided swinging arm is lengthened by 30 mm and controlled by a single Sachs shock. A re-positioned linkage between swinging arm and shock absorber allows 6” of rear wheel travel. 43 mm Marzocchi front forks are fitted, which also have 6” (152mm) of travel. Front and rear suspension is infinitely adjustable. Brakes are from Brembo, the front being 320 mm double discs with radial four-pot calipers, and the rear a single 220 mm with twin pot caliper. Rear panniers with built in lights and, a first for MV, a small adjustable screen are fitted. A new 4.2-gallon fuel tank is fitted that is shorter, allowing a longer seat and brings the riders weight forward. A larger silencer with three tail pipes is fitted which reduces noise to a lower level than other MVs. ===Electronics=== The machine is fitted with an Eldor Nemo EM30 ECU, which includes four rider-selectable engine maps: Rain, Normal, Sport and Custom. The custom mode offers adjustable throttle-response maps, torque-delivery curves, engine braking and traction control. ABS and an anti- stoppie device are also fitted to the machine. The machine has a TFT dashboard, which includes a fuel gauge. This is the first MV model to be fitted with a fuel gauge. ==ReferencesExternal links== * MV Agusta Official Website * Stradale 800 Category:Motorcycles introduced in 2015 ","title":"MV Agusta Stradale 800"},{"id":"61393063","text":"Jorge Mosera Sipaco (born 28 May 2002) is an Equatorial Guinean footballer who plays as a defender for Cano Sport Academy and the Equatorial Guinea national team. ==Club career== Mosera moved from Real X Balompié to Cano Sport in January 2019. ==International career== Mosera made his international debut for Equatorial Guinea on 28 July 2019. ==References== Category:2002 births Category:Living people Category:Association football defenders Category:Equatoguinean footballers Category:Equatorial Guinea international footballers Category:Equatorial Guinea youth international footballers Category:Cano Sport Academy players Category:Bubi people ","title":"Jorge Mosera"},{"id":"61393064","text":"Selim El-Sayed (born 1936) is an Egyptian gymnast.

It premiered on 12 May 1846 at the Royal Danish Theatre in Copenhagen but was only a success after being reworked from one to two acts for the 1858–59 season. ==Background== Andersen's manuscript for Liden Kirsten, Romance Andersen's manuscript for the \\"Tavlebordsduetten\\" When Hans Christian Andersen came to Rome in 1833, he brought with him a collection of medieval Danish folk songs (folkeviser) of which especially Hr. Sverkel would inspire him to write a dramatic play. In January 1835 he had finally completed the libretto to a singspiele entitled LLoden Kirsten. Andersen handed the play over to the Royal Theatre and it was his intention that some of the songs should be performed to traditional folk melodies. It was criticized for suffering from \\"emptiness, thinness and dramatic poverty\\" but was all the same accepted. It was then handed over to the composer Ivar Bredal who was supposed to find and arrange the suitable folk melodies but never completed the work. Around ten years later, Andersen searched for a subject for an opera for his friend J. P. E. Hartmann. From February through August–September 1844, he adapted Liden Kirsten into an opera in one act. He was then ready to show the result to Hartmann. It was in October handed over to the Royal Theatre where it was once again received with some skepticism. Johan Ludvig Heiberg commented that \\"there is no real plot but the situation is romantic and it has a certain poetic air about it which, accompanied by the music (if it is successful), may have a considerable appeal\\". Hartmann began working on the music in the spring of 1845 but delayed its completion. In October, Hartmann explained to Andersen that he would like the Jenny Lind euphoria after her successful performances in Copenhagen to calm down before the premiere of their play. At Christmas time, Jonas Collin could finally inform Andersen, who was in Berlin, that the music for the overture had been completed. Liden Kirsten finally premiered on 12 May 1846 with the soprano Pauline Rung and the baritone Christian Hansen in the leading roles. Andersen was unable to attend the premiere since he was in Southern Italy. The critical reception was mostly positive but the play was no great success at the box office and only played four times before the summer break. Hartmann and Andersen later adapted Liden Kirsten into an opera in two acts for the 1858-59 season and it now received a far more enthusiastic reception. Liden Kirsten was from then on, with interruptions, part of the Royal Theatre's repertoire until 1955. ==In art== The Liden Kirsten relief On the left side of the plinth of the statue of Johan Peter Emilius Hartmann on Sankt Annæ Plads is a bronze relief depicting the \\"Tavlebordsduetten\\" (playing table) scene in Liden Kirsten.

He had a total of 13 seasons of coaching experience before joining Hartford, including two seasons as an assistant coach with the Philadelphia Flyers of the National Hockey League (NHL), and seven years as a head coach in the Canadian junior leagues, during which time he compiled a record of 298–130–16–13. ==Career== Knoblauch is from Imperial, Saskatchewan. He was a seventh-round pick, and the 166th pick overall, of the New York Islanders in the 1997 NHL Entry Draft, but never played at the NHL level. Playing in the position of winger, Knoblauch played parts of four seasons of junior hockey in the Western Hockey League (WHL) from 1995 to 1998 with the Red Deer Rebels, Kootenay Ice, and Lethbridge Hurricanes. He then played for five seasons with the Alberta Golden Bears from 1999 to 2003, during which time he registered 117 points (38 goals and 79 assists) in 102 games. He was part of the team that won a National Championship during the 1999–00 season. Knoblauch would play professionally with the Austin Ice Bats of the Central Hockey League, before finishing his playing career in France as a member of the Bisons de Neuilly-sur-Marne. ==Coaching career== Knoblauch began his coaching career as an assistant coach with the Prince Albert Raiders of the WHL during the 2006–07 season. He became an assistant coach with the Kootenay Ice of the WHL for three seasons from 2007 to 2010, becoming the Ice's head coach in 2010. ===Kootenay Ice=== In his first season with Kootenay during the 2010–11 season, the team posted a 46–21–1–4 record in the regular season, won 16 of 19 WHL playoff games, and won the Ed Chynoweth Cup. Knoblauch continued his success with the Ice the following season, as the team posted a 36-26-5 record, but was swept by the Edmonton Oil Kings in the first round of the WHL playoffs. Knoblauch interviewed for the vacant head coaching position with the University of Alberta Golden Bears men's ice hockey team, and did so without consulting the Ice.What happened in Cranbrook? Despite being on the shortlist for the Golden Bears coaching job, Knoblauch was relieved of his head coaching duties with the Ice on 24 May, 2012.Kootenay head coach Kris Knoblauch fired ===Erie Otters=== Knoblauch became the Erie Otters head coach of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL), a position he held from 2012 to 2017. During his four full seasons with the Erie Otters, the team had a 204–58–7–3 record (.768 points percentage) and won at least 50 games each season. They were the first team in Canadian Hockey League history to post four consecutive 50-win seasons. Erie won the OHL Championship in the 2016–17 season under Knoblauch's leadership. Additionally, the Otters made it to the OHL Championship in the 2014–15 season, and won the Hamilton Spectator Trophy in recognition of having the OHL's best regular season record in consecutive seasons from 2015–16 and 2016–17. Knoblauch was the recipient of the Matt Leyden Trophy in 2015–16, making him OHL Coach of the Year that season. He also made OHL's Second All-Star Team in 2013–14. Knoblauch was the head coach for Canada-Red at the 2015 World U17 Hockey Challenge, and assistant coach with Canada at the 2017 IIHF World U20 Championship, where Canada earned a Silver Medal. During his seven total seasons as head coach of the Kootenay Ice and Erie Otters, Knoblauch compiled a record of 298–130–16–13, and coached such players as Connor McDavid, Alex DeBrincat, André Burakovsky, Connor Brown, Erik Černák, Anthony Cirelli, and Travis Dermott, Sam Reinhart, and Dylan Strome. ===Philadelphia Flyers=== Knoblauch was a Philadelphia Flyers assistant coach during the team's 2017–18 and 2018–19 seasons. ===Hartford Wolf Pack=== The New York Rangers organization announced on July 29, 2019, that Knoblauch had been appointed the head coach of the Hartford Wolf Pack, the Rangers' AHL affiliate team. This marks the first time Knoblauch became a head coach at the professional level. Knoblauch replaced Keith McCambridge, who was fired after two seasons as Hartford coach. Knoblauch is the seventh coach in Wolf Pack history. ==Career statisticsPlaying career=== { BORDER=\\"0\\" CELLPADDING=\\"1\\" CELLSPACING=\\"0\\" WIDTH=\\"75%\\" - ALIGN=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" ! colspan=\\"3\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"5\\"  Regular season ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"5\\"  Playoffs - ALIGN=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" !

This process leads to a unique repertoire of mutations (′the mutanome′) in every patient’s tumor. The mutanome encodes peptides that can be targets for T cells, which play a central role in the immune response. A description of individual mutanomes of human tumors has been made feasible by the introduction of Next Generation Sequencing Technology (NGS). Cancer mutanomes can be defined by comparing exome sequencing data obtained by NGS of individual healthy tissue with sequences from tumor-derived nucleic acids. As the vast majority of cancer- associated mutations are patient specific, shared mutations are rare, even within the same type of cancer. === Neoantigens and neoepitopes === The mutanome encodes a pattern of tumor-specific mutated peptides referred to as neoantigens or m-peptides. Neoantigens are products of mutations that first occur in the course of cancer development. Each and every tumor has its own unique neoantigenic pattern, and even within the same type of cancer, only a small percentage of neoantigens are shared. Neoantigens are presented on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules of tumor cells. The antigenic determinants of neoantigens – neoepitopes – are recognized by the immune system as a target for T cells, thus triggering immune responses against cancer. A neoepitope is an epitope the immune system has not encountered before. Therefore it is not subject to tolerance mechanisms of the immune system. Since the mutated gene product is only expressed in tumors, but not on healthy cells, neoepitopes may evoke vigorous T cell response. == Mutanome immunotherapy == The vast majority of cancer mutations are unique to the individual patient, and a significant portion of mutations (21-45%) are immunogenic. Therefore, the patients' individual mutanome and the neoepitopes are used as the basis for a novel strategy against cancer, which is referred to as individualized cancer immunotherapy. Cancer immunotherapy uses the body's own immune defense system and is based on the recognition by cytotoxic and helper T cells with antitumor activity. === Mutanome-specific vaccines === Strategies to immunotherapeutically address the individual mutanome are currently under investigation. Ongoing mutanome cancer vaccine trials use synthetic peptides and antigen-encoding DNA or RNA as formats. For an individualized treatment, neoepitopes that are thought to elicit a strong immune response are selected out of the patient's mutanome. An increasingly explored concept for individualized cancer immunotherapy is the treatment of a patient with immunogenic mRNA vaccines for a given patient's individual cancer mutanome (IVAC - Individualized Vaccine Against Cancer). The IVAC concept is based on decoding the individual mutanome by NGS and on-demand mRNA manufacturing for use in single patients to produce therapeutic vaccines against cancer. Since 2016, the IVAC concept has been developed as Individualized Neoantigen Specific Therapy (iNeST). The process of NSG based cancer mutanome mapping, target selection, prioritization approaches, synthetic mRNA vaccine manufacturing and delivery is also referred to as MERIT (mutanome engineered RNA immunotherapy). By vaccination with the synthetic mRNA, which contains the blueprint of a mutant tumor peptide, T lymphocytes are activated against the tumor. == References  External links == * The MERIT (Mutanome Engineered RNA Immuno-Therapy) project – European Union funded Initiative * GAPVAC (Glioma Actively Personalized Vaccine Consortium) – European Union funded Initiative Category:Medical genetics Category:Biotechnology Category:Applied genetics Category:Genomics Category:Vaccines Category:Cancer vaccines ","title":"Mutanome"},{"id":"61393328","text":"Johann König (born 21 September 1932) is an Austrian gymnast.

His next appearances in first-class cricket came for British Guiana, playing twice against Trinidad and Barbados in the 1895–96 Inter-Colonial Tournament. In September 1896, he played twice for British Guiana against Jamaica at Georgetown. In February 1897, he played for the West Indies against A. A. Priestley's XI, while in March of the same year he played for British Guiana against a Lord Hawke's XI; the following month, he played for Lord Hawke's XI against British Guiana, likely due to a broken finger suffered by Hugh Bromley-Davenport, which limited his appearances on the tour. He played his final first-class match for Demerara in the final of the 1897–98 Inter- Colonial Tournament. A gap of four years followed before his next first-class appearance for British Guiana in September 1901. Between 1902-07, he made six further first-class appearances for British Guiana. In eighteen first-class appearances, he scored 255 runs at an average of 11.09 and a highest score of 55. With his left-arm fast-medium bowling, he took 25 wickets at a bowling average of 11.47, with best figures of 8 for 17. He took five wickets in an innings on two occasions and took the same number of ten wicket hauls in a match. His best figures came for Demerara on debut against Barbados. Outside of cricket, he worked as a civil servant and was married to Maud Frances. He later emigrated to England, where he died at Bedford in December 1946. His brother's Cyril, Arthur and Walter all played first-class cricket, as did his brothers-in-law Francis Austin and Russell Garnett, and his nephew Ian Fleming. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:1871 births Category:1946 deaths Category:People from Georgetown, Guyana Category:Guyanese cricketers Category:Demerara cricketers Category:Guyana cricketers Category:Lord Hawke's XI cricketers Category:Guyanese emigrants to England ","title":"Oscar Weber"},{"id":"61393343","text":"The Serrade Petit is a breed of cat that originated in France. ==History== Serrade Petits are a fairly recently developed breed, and have not yet been recognised by any cat breed associations. ==Characteristics== The Serrade Petit is a small cat, weighing only about .

He studied the Bracero program (an agricultural guest-worker program) as a graduate student in Public Health at the University of California. He was Director of Research at Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee (AWOC), an early AFL/CIO-sponsored effort to unionize farm workers. Anderson organized and led Citizens for Farm Labor, a San Francisco Bay Area-based group that supported farm labor organization activities. He wrote the book “So Shall Ye Reap” documenting the history of farm labor unionization in California. ==Early life== Anderson was born in Plano, Texas, and grew up primarily in Palo Alto, California. He was class president of Palo Alto High School in his senior year, 1943-44. After a stint in the Army, he graduated from Pomona College in 1949. He received a Masters in Sociology from the University of Hawaii in 1951, and then worked for the California Department of Public Health. ==Bracero health study== In 1955 Anderson enrolled in the UC Berkeley School of Public Health. He proposed a research project to study health issues among migrant Mexican farm workers in the U.S. This project was funded by an NIH grant under Professor Edward Rogers. Anderson learned that the majority of these farm workers were part of the bracero program, a federal program under which agriculture companies hired temporary Mexican workers. The program had rules protecting the health and rights of the workers, but these were left to the growers to enforce, and most workers lived in poor conditions. In 1957, with the help of a Spanish-speaking assistant, Anderson surveyed thousands of incoming braceros at the \\"reception centers\\" in Empalme, Sonora, Mexico and El Centro, California. While conducting the study, Anderson learned about the political and economic context in which the Bracero program existed, which he later described as \\"... a system that served a conglomerate of economic interests, all of them on one side of the scale. It was a program largely of benefit to industrialized agriculture, and as part of their system they seemed to have friends among the government agencies that were supposed to be administering the program. It wasn't exactly slavery, but they had to sign contracts that bound them to work for whoever they were told, doing whatever they were told, at whatever wages and conditions they were told, for however long they were told -- which they had absolutely no say and no power to change.\\" In 1958 Anderson learned that the bracero program's enabling legislation - Public Law 78 - was under Congressional review, and that the executive committee of the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) was meeting in San Francisco to decide whether to take a stand on it. He was invited to make a presentation to the committee, but was unable to do so. Instead, he sent the committee a written statement entitled \\"Social Justice and Foreign Contract Labor\\", describing his observations and opinions. As it turned out, the AFSC distributed Anderson's statement to a number of government officials involved in the bracero program. He soon received letters from officials in the California State Department of Employment and the U.S. Department of Labor challenging his statement and demanding its retraction. The State Farm Bureau Federation, a trade group for agri-business with ties to the state government and UC, also received the statement. They made the connection to Anderson's research project and quickly moved to stop it. His assistant was removed from Empalme and barred from El Centro. Initially, Anderson was told that the project would be immediately ended (and he would be fired) unless he retracted the statement's assertions. He refused to do this, and eventually a compromise was offered in which he would be allowed to write up the results of his existing interview data but would not be allowed to collect more. Anderson eventually completed a 750-page Masters thesis. It contained a chapter describing the economic and political context of the bracero program. Because of this chapter, his advisor, Prof. Rogers, forced him to recall the 100 copies he had distributed, and destroy them all. Later (August 1961), at the request of Prof. Rogers, Anderson wrote an abridged (328 page) version of the report.The bracero program in California, with particular reference to health status, attitudes, and practices. Henry Anderson. School of Public Health, University of California, 1961. It was later published under the title “The Bracero Program in California”, by Arno Press, in 1982. ==Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee (AWOC)== In 1959, Anderson left the university, disillusioned by what he viewed as its failure to stand up to the bracero lobby in defense of academic freedom. During that period there were several nascent efforts to organize farm workers, with both grass-roots and top-down dues-collecting approaches. One of the latter was the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee (AWOC), which was being formed and financed by the AFL-CIO, under the direction of Norman Smith, who had organized automobile workers in the 1930s. Smith contacted Anderson and offered him a job as Director of Research, which he accepted and started in July 1959. At AWOC, Anderson wrote about fifty research reports on various labor-related topics such as wages, crop prices and legislative activity. These were distributed to other unions, government agencies, and growers’ organizations. He did some research in the fields - for example, to survey wages actually being paid to workers.“The Wages which Prevail”: AWOC research report written by Anderson in August 1959. In 1959 he testified on behalf of AWOC at congressional hearings in Washington DC. AWOC had little success in organizing farm workers, although it was peripherally involved in brief strikes by cherry and lettuce workers. While at AWOC Anderson met a number of people with significant roles in the labor movement. Dolores Huerta briefly worked at AWOC as a secretary; she soon left and joined Cesar Chavez at the Community Service Organization. Ernesto Galarza, who had led earlier unionization efforts, served briefly as Assistant Director. In June 1961 the AFL/CIO cut off funding to AWOC. The organization continued operating with reserve funds for another year; the staff were laid off except Anderson. Anderson began organizing community-based volunteer activities. He conceived and organized “Harvest House”, a house in Stockton (near agricultural areas) where volunteers from the Bay Area could visit and help in various ways. In November 1961 Anderson conceived the idea of convening everyone involved in the farm labor movement to discuss the methods and goals of the movement. He organized the conference, which was held in the town of Strathmore on December 2–3. About 200 people attended. Attendees included Norman Smith, Father Thomas McCullough, and Dolores Huerta. The keynote speaker was Norman Thomas, the leader of the American Socialist party. The conference was the subject of a radio documentary, “We will go on”, by Ernest Lowe, which aired on Feb 1, 1962 on KPFA.“We will go on”: radio documentary on the Strathmore conference (1962). The annual convention of the AFL-CIO was taking place in Miami one week after the Strathmore conference, and AWOC was entitled to send a voting delegate. It was decided to send Maria Moreno as the delegate. A documentary about Moreno, “Adios Amor”,Adios Amor, a documentary about Maria Moreno. Anderson appears starting at 6:17 and 41:21. describes this and includes interview footage with Anderson. ==Later career== After leaving AWOC in May 1962, Anderson returned to the California State Department of Public Health as a researcher. From 1965 to 1968 he worked on a project to study claims filed by doctors under the recently created Medi-Cal program. The study found rampant fraud, but because of the strong AMA lobby, these findings never led to prosecution or policy change .“Statistical surveillance of a Title XIX program.”, Henry Anderson, American Journal of Public Health and the Nations Health 59, pp. 275-289, Feb. 1969. From 1968 to 1975 he worked on a project to study the health effects of pesticide usage on farm workers, and to make recommendations for regulation of this usage. In July 1963 Anderson did a commentary on KPFA - a listener-supported radio station in Berkeley, California - about the future of farm labor after the Bracero program, which had been ended by Congress earlier that year. This evolved into a series of monthly commentaries, initially on farm labor but eventually branching out to broader political and social issues, which continued to 1972 .One of Anderson's KPFA commentaries, Jan. 1968. In October 1963, Anderson organized Citizens for Farm Labor, a Berkeley-based community group with the goal of supporting farm labor causes, informing the public, and participating in public and legislative hearings . The group published a monthly newsletter, “Farm Labor Magazine” . Archive containing Citizens for Farm Labor newsletters from 1963-67. In 1965, the group supported the United Farm Workers grape strike in Delano by delivering truckloads of food to the striking workers. In February 1965 Anderson was invited by the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) to participate in a meeting in Biloxi, Mississippi, to discuss connections between the farm labor and civil rights movements. Other attendees at the meeting included Stokely Carmichael and Howard Zinn. In March 1965, Anderson was approached by Joan London, the daughter of Jack London and a member of Citizens for Farm Labor, with the idea of co-authoring a book about the history of the farm labor movement in California. This book, “So Shall Ye Reap”, was published in 1970. After leaving the Department of Public Health in 1975, Anderson became a real estate investor and landlord in the Berkeley area, but he continued labor-related activities. In 1982 Anderson was invited to the 20th anniversary celebration, in San Jose, of the founding of the National Farm Workers Association by Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta in Delano. In 1993 Anderson attended the memorial service for Cesar Chavez in Delano. In October 2001 he organized, with Gilbert Gonzalez, a panel on guest worker programs at the North American Labor History Conference (NALHC). He was presented with a Lifetime Achievement Award by the Southwest Labor Studies Organization (SLSO) for his contributions to labor history. Anderson wrote an unfinished biography of mining union leader Vincent Saint John. He learned that Saint John was buried in an unmarked grave in Oakland's Mountain View Cemetery, and together with Archie Green he organized an initiative to raise money for a headstone. The headstone was installed in a ceremony in June 2001. Anderson is interviewed extensively in “Harvest of Loneliness”, a 2010 documentary about the Bracero program, directed by Gilbert Gonzalez .Harvest of Loneliness, documentary about the Bracero program (2010) He also appears in “Adios Amor”, a 2017 documentary about Maria Moreno, directed by Laurie Coyle. Anderson died in Oakland on Oct. 24, 2016, survived by his wife, Virginia Foote Anderson, and five children. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Henry P.

Oxy. 1800; FGrHist 1139) is a piece of a papyrus roll containing biographies of various mythical and historical figures from ancient Greece. The papyrus was discovered in 1905-06 as part of a large group of literary papyri, and is made up of 30 fragments. It is dated by the handwriting to the late second or early third century AD. Biographies of Sappho, Simonides, Aesop, Thucydides, Demosthenes, Aeschines, Thrasybulus, Hyperides, Leucocomas, and Abderus are identifiable; other fragments of the papyrus may be from lives of Alcaeus and Lysias. It is unclear why these biographies were grouped together. The arrangement is equally uncertain - while it makes sense for two lyric poets whose name begins with the same letter to be grouped together, it is less clear why the Athenian logographer Hyperides should come next to the mythical Leucocomas. The lives may have been arranged into smaller groupings, such as Sappho and Simonides (both lyric poets), Demosthenes and Aeschines (Attic orators), and Thrasybulus and Hyperides (known for overthrowing tyrants); an overarching ordering principle remains elusive. Graziano Arrighetti identifies the papyrus as an epitome of ancient biographies.

The series began in 2003 with the release of Defense of the Ancients (DotA), a fan-developed multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) mod for the video game Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos and its expansion, The Frozen Throne. The original mod features gameplay centered around two teams of up to five players who assume control of individual characters called \\"heroes\\", which must coordinate to destroy the enemy's central base structure called an \\"Ancient\\", to win the game. Ownership and development of DotA was passed on multiple times since its initial release, until Valve hired the mod's final developer and after an ongoing legal dispute with Blizzard Entertainment, the developer of Warcraft III, brokered a deal that allowed for Valve to inherit the Dota name trademark. The first standalone installment in the series, Dota 2, was released by Valve in July 2013. A sequel to DotA, the game retains the same gameplay elements as its predecessor, while introducing new support and mechanics, as well as a setting separate from the Warcraft universe. Artifact, a digital collectible card game with mechanics inspired by Dota 2, was released in 2018. Dota Underlords, an auto battler based on the community- created Dota 2 mod Dota Auto Chess, was released in 2020. The original DotA mod is considered one of the most popular mods of all time, with tens of millions of players and a consistent presence at esports tournaments throughout the 2000s. DotA is considered a pivotal catalyst for the MOBA genre, inspiring developers to create other games similar to it. Likewise, Dota 2 is acclaimed as one of the greatest video games of all time, with an active player base in the millions and an esports presence hallmarked by record-breaking prize pools that culminate in the annual championship known as The International. The spinoff games by Valve have been positively received, although Artifact was considered a critical and commercial failure as a large majority of its initial playerbase was lost within weeks. ==Games== The Dota series includes four games that are centered around competitive, online multiplayer gameplay. The original mod, Defense of the Ancients, is a community-created Warcraft III gamemode developed with the Warcraft III World Editor that first released in 2003. The franchise name, \\"Dota\\", is derived from the original mod's acronym, DotA. Dota 2, its standalone installment, was released as a free-to-play sequel in July 2013. The first spin-off, a digital collectible card game called Artifact, was released in November 2018. The second spin-off, an auto battler called Dota Underlords, was released in February 2020. The main installments in the series are multiplayer online battle arena games, where the player assumes control over a single character - a \\"hero\\" - from a large roster of characters and coordinates with their teammates to destroy their opponents' large structure called an Ancient, while defending their own. Unlike the original mod, which is largely derived from the setting of the Warcraft series, the standalone games share their own continuity. Likewise, the standalone games utilize the Source game engine and Steam distribution platform - both developed by Valve. ===Defense of the Ancients (DotA)=== The installment which established the Dota intellectual property was the Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos custom mod Defense of the Ancients (DotA). Independently developed and released by the pseudonymous designer Eul in 2003, it was inspired by \\"Aeon of Strife\\", a multiplayer StarCraft map. Before every DotA match, up to ten players are organized into two teams called the Scourge and the Sentinel - inspired by the factions from Warcraft lore - with the former in the northeast corner and the latter in the southwest corner of a nearly-symmetrical map. Using one of several game modes, the players each choose a single powerful unit called a \\"hero\\", who they are granted control of throughout the match. Heroes maintain special tactical advantages, in the way of their statistics, attack and damage types, as well as abilities that can be learned and enhanced through leveling up from combat. Team coordination and roster composition are considered crucial for a successful match. The currency of the game is gold, which may be used for purchasing items that may enhance a hero's statistics and provide special abilities. Gold is awarded to players for destroying enemies and in increments on a rolling basis, while also being deducted for the death of one's hero. Heroes battle alongside weaker computer-controlled infantry units periodically dispatched in waves, who traverse three paths called \\"lanes\\", which connect the Scourge and Sentinel bases. Each lane is lined with defensive towers, which are not only more powerful the closer they are to their respective bases, but invulnerable until their predecessors are destroyed. At the center of each base is a central structure called an \\"Ancient\\", which is either the World Tree for the Sentinel or the Frozen Throne for the Scourge. To win a match, the enemy's Ancient must be destroyed. ===Dota 2=== Valve's interest in the Dota intellectual property began when several veteran employees, including Team Fortress 2 designer Robin Walker and executive Erik Johnson, became fans of the mod and wanted to build a modern sequel. The company corresponded with IceFrog by email about his long-term plans for the project, and he was subsequently hired to direct a sequel. IceFrog first announced his new position through his blog in October 2009, with Dota 2 being officially announced a year later. Shortly after, Valve filed a trademark claim to the Dota name. At Gamescom 2011, company president Gabe Newell explained that the trademark was needed to develop a sequel with the already-identifiable brand. Holding the Dota name to be a community asset, Feak and Mescon filed an opposing trademark for Dota on behalf of DotA-Allstars, LLC (then a subsidiary of Riot Games) in August 2010. Rob Pardo, the executive vice president of Blizzard Entertainment at the time, similarly stated that the Dota name belonged to the mod's community. Blizzard acquired DotA-Allstars, LLC from Riot Games and filed an opposition against Valve in November 2011, citing Blizzard's ownership of both the Warcraft III World Editor and DotA-Allstars, LLC as proper claims to the franchise name. The dispute was settled in May 2012, with Valve retaining commercial rights to the Dota trademark, while allowing non-commercial use of the name by third-parties. An early goal of the Dota 2 team was the adaptation of Defense of the Ancients aesthetic style for the Source engine. The Radiant and Dire factions replaced the Sentinel and Scourge from the mod, respectively. Character names, abilities, items and map design from the mod were largely retained, with some changes due to trademarks owned by Blizzard. In the first Q&A; session regarding Dota 2, IceFrog explained that the game would build upon the mod without making significant changes to its core. Valve contracted major contributors from the Defense of the Ancients community, including Eul and artist Kendrick Lim, to assist with the sequel. Following nearly two years of beta testing, Dota 2 was officially released on Steam for Windows on July 9, 2013, and for OS X and Linux on July 18, 2013. The game did not launch with every hero from Defense of the Ancients. Instead, the missing ones were added in various post-release updates, with the final one, as well as the first Dota 2 original hero, being added in 2016. Since its release, Dota 2 has been cited as one of the greatest video games of all time. It is also the most lucrative esports game of all time, earning teams and players a total of over 100 million by June 2017. ===Artifact=== Artifact is a digital collectible card game based on Dota 2, developed and published by Valve. The game focuses on online player versus player battles across three boards called lanes. Development of it began in late 2014, with lead designer Richard Garfield being brought in to help make a digital card game due to his experience with creating the Magic: The Gathering franchise. The game was then announced via a teaser trailer played at The International 2017, a large Dota 2-specific esports tournament organized by Valve. Artifact was released for Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux in November 2018, with versions planned for Android and iOS. While its gameplay and drafting mechanics received praise, it was criticized for its high learning curve and monetization model, which some likened to being pay-to-win. The game saw a 95% decline in players within two months of its release, and had fewer than 100 concurrent players by mid 2019. ===Dota Underlords=== Dota Underlords is a free-to-play auto battler, a type of chess-like competitive multiplayer strategy video game, developed and published by Valve. The game is based on a Dota 2 community-created game mode called Dota Auto Chess, with journalists noting the parallel modding origins that DotA had from Warcraft III. It was released in early access in June 2019 for Android, iOS, macOS, Microsoft Windows, and Linux, with it planned to be officially released in February 2020. One of the many auto battler games that released following the popularity of Dota Auto Chess, critics considered it one of the easiest to get into for newer players of the genre. ==IceFrog== IceFrog (born ) is the pseudonymous lead designer of Defense of the Ancients and Dota 2. His involvement with the series began in 2005, when he inherited the reins of DotA Allstars from \\"Neichus\\", who himself inherited it from Steve \\"Guinsoo\\" Feak. IceFrog is also noted for his anonymity, having never publicly disclosed his identity. In February 2009, IceFrog revealed on his blog that he was 25 years old at the time. In 2010, an anonymous person who claimed to be a Valve employee wrote a blog post titled \\"The Truth About IceFrog\\", in which he claims that IceFrog had previously worked secretly on Heroes of Newerth for S2 Games before joining Valve in 2009, as well as stating his identity as Abdul Ismail. A court document regarding the ownership of the Dota intellectual property from April 2017 confirmed Ismail as the identity of IceFrog, as well as his pre-Valve contributions in Heroes of Newerth. ==References== Category:Esports games Category:Video game franchises introduced in 2003 Category:Multiplayer online battle arena games Category:Valve Corporation franchises ","title":"Dota"},{"id":"61393714","text":"Elan Daley (born 27 February 2005) is a Bermudian swimmer.

By the early 1800s Ava was no longer its own territory. In fact it had not been a territory since 1555.Wikipedia entry on Ava, accessed May 2017. From the mid 15th century, Europeans used the term Ava to refer to central and northern Myanmar (Burma).Encyclopedia Brittanica entry on Ava, accessed May 2017. The branch of the family descended from Sophar's daughter Margaret were told they were descended from a prince.Oral history collected from living descendants of Sophar Rangoon Most chiefs in Burma were princes, although a few were wealthy landowners, so this seems fairly likely. However princes were not necessarily royalty. Royal princes included the sons and brothers of the King. The other category of princes were individuals of non- royal lineage who were promoted to the rank of prince, and were divided into 3 ranks of 18 princes.Wikipedia page on Burmese Royal Titles. Accessed May 2017. The branch of the family descended from Sophar's son Frederick have passed down the story that Sophar was rescued from a ship or boat by an Englishman. Two interesting facts come together at this point: 1) when their warships were boarded, the Burmese generally jumped overboard Marshall, John. Narrative of the naval operations in Ava, during the Burmese war, in 1824,1825, and 1826. London: Longman, Reese, et al, 1830. Page 37. and 2) Burmese chiefs were known to go into battle with their children in tow as demonstrated by this account of Prince Tharawaddy's overthrow of his brother Bagyidaw: :\\"Prince Tharawaddy... crossed to the north bank of the Ayeyarwaddy by the Shwe Tone boat... with his children, maids and fully armed 700 men, marched to Yadana Theinga Myo and rebelled against his elder brother.\\"https://nyiwin.wordpress.com/2013/03/18/nanmadaw-me-nu- နန္းမေတာ္-မယ္ႏု-sagaing-min-စစ္က/ There is a newspaper report about an incident at the beginning of the war where came up against a Burmese war boat, the British boarded and all the Burmese jumped in the water. They found a baby on board which they took and looked after on the ship. The captain said he intended to bring him back to England to be educated. Although HMS Liffey entered the war in Burma under the command of Commodore Grant, within a few weeks Grant was \\"indisposed\\" and departed Rangoon, leaving the ship under the command of Captain Marryat. So it would have been Marryat who took charge of the Burmese baby. Naval Database. Accessed May 2017. A baby would be too young to be Sophar although it's possible Sophar was also on the ship but, being older, was not as newsworthy. A Burmese toddler died on the ship that took Sophar to England which could have been the rescued baby as he would have been a toddler by this point. Some online genealogies show Sophar as the son of Tharawaddy. It is possible that Sophar is a son of Tharawaddy, as he was commanding part of the war in Rangoon at the time and he was known to take his children into battle with him. Prince Tharrawaddy had 18 sons by various queens, many of which do not have the year of birth listed and simply say \\"died young\\". If Sophar and another child were left behind on a ship taken by the British and were never seen by their family again, it's possible their family would have thought they had died. However, without knowing whose ship was boarded by HMS Liffey at the beginning of the war and whether Sophar was also found on board this ship along with the unnamed baby, it is impossible to determine Sophar's parentage at this point. == References == Category:Burmese expatriates in the United Kingdom Category:Immigrants to the Kingdom of England Category:Tailors Category:British people of Burmese descent Category:1817 births Category:1890 deaths ","title":"Sophar Rangoon"},{"id":"61393751","text":"Anicka Delgado (born 13 June 2002) is an Ecuadorian swimmer.

In cricket, a ground is a location where cricket matches are played, comprising a cricket field and any associated buildings and amenities. A batsman's ground is the area behind the popping crease at their end of the pitch. ==Location for matches== In addition to the cricket field, the ground may include a pavilion, viewing areas or stadium, a car park, shops, bars, floodlights, sight screens, gates, and conference facilities. ==Parts of the pitch== A batsman's ground is the area behind the popping crease at his end of the pitch. In general, a ground belongs only to the batsman who is closest to it, and stays so until the other batsman gets closer to it. A batsman who is in one ground is considered to be the same distance away from the other ground as the distance between the grounds. Whether a batsman is in or out of his ground is defined by Law 30 of the Laws of Cricket. So long as the batsman has his body or his bat (that he is holding) touching the ground, he is in it. If a batsman is out of his ground, he may be dismissed by being run out or stumped. Batsmen can run from one ground to the other to score runs. ==References== Category:Cricket terminology ","title":"Ground (cricket)"},{"id":"61393899","text":"Selina Ssubi Katumba (born 27 June 2003) is a Ugandan swimmer.

The cup is described in the Iliad. ==Epic cycle== Nestor's Cup is described in Book 11 of the Iliad. Machaon, son of Asclepius, is injured by Paris, and taken back to the Greek camp by Nestor; a healing drink is prepared for him in the cup. The cup is described over six lines. { πὰρ δὲ δέπας περικαλλές, ὃ οἴκοθεν ἦγ᾽ ὁ γεραιός, χρυσείοις ἥλοισι πεπαρμένον: οὔατα δ᾽ αὐτοῦ τέσσαρ᾽ ἔσαν, δοιαὶ δὲ πελειάδες ἀμφὶς ἕκαστον χρύσειαι νεμέθοντο, δύω δ᾽ ὑπὸ πυθμένες ἦσαν. ἄλλος μὲν μογέων ἀποκινήσασκε τραπέζης πλεῖον ἐόν, Νέστωρ δ᾽ ὁ γέρων ἀμογητὶ ἄειρεν. — style=\\"padding-left:2em; width:30em;\\"There was also a cup of rare workmanship which the old man had brought with him from home, studded with bosses of gold; it had four handles, on each of which there were two golden doves feeding, and it had two feet to stand on. Any one else would hardly have been able to lift it from the table when it was full, but Nestor could do so quite easily. —Translated by Samuel Butler, 1898 } Along with its description in the Iliad, the cup of Nestor may have appeared elsewhere in the epic cycle. Stephanie West argues that there was a pre-existing body of poetry which dealt with Nestor's heroic exploits in his youth, and which told of Nestor's cup. Peter Allan Hansen suggests that the cup may have appeared in the Cypria, perhaps in the episode known from a citation in Athenaeus where Nestor gives Menelaus counsel after the abduction of Helen. ==Reception== Despite its relatively brief description in the Iliad - a mere six lines, compared to some 130 describing the Shield of Achilles in Book 18 - the cup was the subject of a great deal of attention in antiquity. Ancient critics writing on the Iliad were particularly interested in three aspects of Nestor's Cup: its size, why it was that only Nestor could lift it, and the doves on its handles. At least as early as the fifth century BC, scholars including Glaucon, Antisthenes, and Stesimbrotos addressed the question of why Nestor was the only one who could lift his cup; the problem continued to be addressed throughout antiquity at least up until the time of Porphyry, who included it in his Homeric Questions. The doves were discussed by Asclepiades of Myrleia, and caught the imagination of Martial, who mentions them in his description of Nestor's cup in poem 8.6. ==ReferencesWorks cited== * * * Category:Iliad ","title":"Nestor's Cup (mythology)"},{"id":"61394068","text":"Shoplifter (real name Hrafnhildur Arnardóttir) is a New York-based contemporary artist who works with synthetic and natural hair.

All serviceman in the regiment must meet the minimum requirement of centimeters. ==History== President George W. Bush on 22 June 2006. It was the Hungarian People's Army's 7015th Ceremonial Regiment (Hungarian: Magyar Néphadsereg 7015 Dísz -és őrezred), being at the time the official honor guard and escort of the leadership of the Hungarian People's Republic. The regiment took the name of the 32nd Budapest Guard Regiment on 15 May 1991 by order of Hungarian Minister of Defence Lajos Für. On 1 October 2000, the regiment was named the 32nd Budapest Guard and Ornament. As of 1 January 2002, as part of the force reform, the organizational structure of the regiment changed. A support battalion was formed from the two independent centuries and divisions from the logistics headquarters. On New Year's Day in 2003, Colonel László Talpas became the first and last commander of the regiment, having previously completed the Military Observer Training Course in 1998 and serving in the United Nations International Mission in Western Sahara in 2000. It operated until 31 December 2006, at which time it was disbanded to be replaced by the Ceremonial Battalion branch (part of the MH \\"Támogató Dandár\\" HDF Support Brigade) on 1 January 2007. In the course of this, members of the regiment took part in many HDF operations and assignments overseas. It was converted on 1 January 2011 to Nemzeti Honvéd Díszegység (National Home Defense Ceremonial Regiment) as part of the MH TD and achieved service on 25 April. The decision to re-establish the Holy Crown Guard was made on 20 December 2010 (based on the 1928 Act) with support from the Hungarian Crown Guard Association. On 30 May 2011, due to the resurgence of traditions, the Holy Crown Guard was reestablished and took over the right to protect the Holy Crown again after 66 years (it was last performed in 1944 by members of the Hungarian Royal Crown Guard).Koronaőrök szép ünnepe ==Regimental customs and traditionDress uniform=== Modern Hungarian army ski cap In 1949, a new uniform was introduced, which was similar to the Soviet pattern and molded to honor Hungarian traditions. In 1960, a cotton uniform was introduced. In 1990, a new tunic and other garments were introduced to the tradition that existed in the Horthy era, but was later modified to avoid fascist comparisons. For a time, a green field uniform was used in the unit until a brown full dress uniform was introduced in the early 2000s.https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/europe/hu-uniforms.htm During the changing of the guard, members of the guard wear sunglasses while the ceremony is occurring as well as on guard duty. Since 1990, the guard has worn a native Ski cap known as a Bocskai. Prior to the introduction of this, the unit used a Peaked cap similar to the Soviet model beginning in 1958 with the communist emblem on top. It is named after the Crown of Stephen Bocskai, given to the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire to Prince Stephen Bocskai of Transylvania in the 17th century. ===Musical support=== Being the representative musical ensemble of the HDF, the Hungarian Defense Forces Central Military Band support the regiment musically during protocol events. Being part of the same garrison brigade gives the regiment and the band direct access to each other. Today, the Central Band maintains a fanfare unit as well as a drum corps. The band wears the same uniform as the regiment.http://bhd.honvedseg.hu/rovat/kozponti_zenekar ===Regimental memorial=== The 32nd Infantry Regiment Memorial (32. Gyalogsági ezred Emlékmű) is located on Baross Street in the Józsefváros District of Budapest. The memorial honors the ethnically Hungarian 32nd Infantry Regiment of the Royal Hungarian Honvéd of the Austro-Hungarian Army based in Dés (now Dej, Romania). The memorial was chosen due to the mere fact that bot units bear the same unit number, 32. It was erected in 1933 after a public donation by István Szentgyörgyi to honor the members of the regiment who served in the First World War.http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WMA0G7_Monument_of_the_32nd_Mria_Terzia_Home_Regiment_BudapestBudapesti utcanevek A - Z. 274. old.

A modified goose step is performed by the rest of the unit, with the foot raised only a few inches off the ground. In quick time, the unit marches in a similar fashion to the United States Army and the British Army. They usually goosestep while their rifles are in their trademark sling arms position while march regularly when their rifles are sloped. ==Guard mounting ceremony== The regiment has provided sentries at the gates of the Sándor Palace (the official residence of the President of Hungary) in Budapest in a Guard mounting ceremony since the Hungarian People's Republic's disestablishment in 1989 and President Ferenc Mádl's move in the palace in 2003.https://wheretostayinbudapest.com/changing- guard-sandor-palace-budapest/ The sentries come at 12 pm in a team of six while only two them will actually take up the guard.

This usually happened between 15 March and 23 October (both dates are Hungary's National Day), during which it stood permanent guard on the square. ==Other duties== The regiment takes part in many events related to the following Hungarian public holidays: *National Day (15 March and 23 October) *National Defense Day (21 May) *Heroes' Day (31 May) *State Foundation Day (20 August) In also participates in the following professional activities:https://www.beol.hu/kozelet/helyi-kozelet/a-diszelgo- katonanak-turni-kell-a-monotonitast-1338473/ * State Funerals * State visits ny foreign leaders to the capital. * Rednering honors for the President, the Prime Minister of Hungary, the Minister of Defence and the Chief of General Staff * The presentation of credentials of ambassadors of foreign countries and organizations * Participates in military parades of the HDF An officer of the regiment escorting Vladimir Putin and Viktor Orban through the halls of Parliament in 2017.

A majority of his buildings are located in Indiana, Kentucky, and Ohio. Five of his projects are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. == Education, training, and career == Partnering with some of the leading architects and firms of the area, he served as the designer for the projects, with his partners supervising the actual construction. He appears to have been equally comfortable designing large scale public buildings, such as churches and courthouses, as well as single family dwellings for wealthy clients. Educated at Washington University's School of Fine Arts, John S. Adkins trained in St. Louis while working for George I. Barnett; Shepley, Rutan & Coolidge; and Peabody & Stearns. While at Peabody & Stearns, he likely helped with the design of buildings for the World's Columbian Exposition held in Chicago in 1893. After moving to Cincinnati in 1893, Adkins partnered with Samuel Hannaford & Sons, George S. Werner, Frank M. Andrews, H.E. Kennedy, Christian Weber, Edward Weber, Matthew H. Burton, and Hugh M. Garriott. When partnering with other architects, Adkins typically did the design work himself while the partner supervised actual construction of the building. “Adkins was a specialist in refined Beaux-Arts or Traditional design, based on a variety of historic styles, usually handled with authenticity, restraint, and craftsmanship of quietly high quality.” He had “an original manner of so designing a building that its location, material and design all blend into one complete and harmonious whole. In fact, the genius he displays in creating buildings that harmonize with their surroundings, the material of which they are constructed and the purpose for which they are intended, prove that he is an architect and not merely a draughtsman or a drawer of tasteful designs.” While specializing in Beaux-Arts design, particularly for public building projects, Adkins designed residences for wealthy clients in various styles, notably Tudor-Revival and Jacobethan designs. Spending the majority of his career in the Cincinnati area, Adkins drew upon the skills of local craftsmen, such as the Cincinnati art carvers movement and Rookwood Pottery, as well as using the abundant local timber and limestone. This use of high-quality craftsmanship and local materials fit beautifully within Adkins' commissions, particularly the Tudor and Jacobethan buildings' emphasis on local materials and craftsmanship. == Buildings on the National Register == alt= alt= Scioto County Courthouse * Cincinnati Gymnasium & Athletic Club, Cincinnati, Ohio * Kentucky Governor’s Mansion, Frankfort, Kentucky * Lillybanks residence, Cincinnati, Ohio * City Hall and Municipal Building, Norwood, Ohio * Scioto County Courthouse, Portsmouth, Ohio == Other buildings == *Audubon Building, Canal and Burgundy Streets, New Orleans, Louisiana. * Cincinnati Public Library, Norwood Branch, 4325 Montgomery Road, Norwood, Ohio * Grace Episcopal Church, 5501 Hamilton Avenue, Cincinnati, Ohio * Charles Atkins residence, 4008 Rose Hill Avenue, Cincinnati, Ohio * First National and Norwood National Banks, Norwood, Ohio * Brighton German Bank, Colerain and Harrison Avenues, Cincinnati, Ohio * First Baptist Church, Lexington, Kentucky. * Kanawha National Bank, Charleston, West Virginia *Clinton County Ohio Courthouse, 53 East Main Street, Wilmington, Ohio *The General Denver Hotel, 81 West Main Street, Wilmington, Ohio *Maplewood, William Ball residence, Muncie, Indiana, *Nurses’ Residence Hall, Ball State University, Muncie, Indiana *Colonel Alvin Owsley residence, Dallas, Texas *Second National Bank Building, 830 Main Street, Cincinnati, Ohio *First Baptist Church, 548 West Short Street, Lexington, Kentucky == References == Category:1872 births Category:1931 deaths Category:20th-century American architects Category:19th-century American architects ","title":"John Scudder Adkins"},{"id":"61394258","text":"Justin Roiland's Solo Vanity Card Productions! is an animation studio founded by animator and voice actor Justin Roiland.

The Süddeutsche Zeitung stated that she is the \\"loudest voice of German feminism\\" in 2019. Stokowski advocates freedom for every gender and often criticizes the neo liberal economy for the oppression of women especially, but also men. According to her views, the modern German society often misleads women into buying goods they don't need or being unhappy with their own bodies by setting up impossible-to-reach beauty standards. She states that a non-patriarchal world would be better for everybody and sees the fear of losing power as the main motivation for some people to cling on to patriarchy. Stokowski is an sharp observer and critic of right-wing tendencies all over the world. As of July 2019, Stokowski has published two books off her own, namely Untenrum frei (Freedom underneath) in 2016 and Die letzten Tage des Patriarchats (The last days of patriarchy) in 2018.

His Ph.D. dissertation dealt with the phenomenology of the pre- and non-conceptual human experience as explored by Edmund Husserl (1859–1938), the German founder of the phenomenological movement in philosophy. Holenstein gained professorial status (habilitation) by a book on the phenomenological structuralism of Roman Jacobson. Between 1971 and 1997 he continued his studies at the Husserl archive in Leuven, at Harvard University with Roman Jakobson, and at the University of Hawai'i. He was a member of the \\"linguistic universals project UNITYP\\" of the Swiss linguist Hansjakob Seiler at the University of Cologne and pursued further research with Joseph Greenberg at Stanford University, also at the Institute of the Studies of Languages and Cultures of Asia and Africa in Tokyo, and at the Collegium Budapest. From 1977 to 1990 Holenstein taught philosophy at the Ruhr University in Bochum, Germany, then at ETH Zurich until his retirement in 2002 when he moved to Yokohama, Japan. In the academic year 1986/87 he was guest professor at the University of Tokyo and in 2004 Tang-Chun-I Professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. == Main philosophical viewpoints  Decentering the ego === Holenstein's early philosophical analyses strive to clarify the processes involved in cognition, especially in associations, that occur \\"without the (conscious and volitional) participation of the I.\\" In his programmatic essay \\"Der Nullpunkt der Orientierung\\" (The Zero-Point of Orientation), Holenstein demonstrates that the \\"I\\", while indeed the point of origin of his or her perceptions, is experienced in no way as the orientational center of his or her field of perception. The mightest object in this field functions as center of orientation. Its form (Gestalt) is thereby often more decisive than its meaning. The significance of \\"I-consciousness\\" in ethical action, however, as well as in communication, being structured by a sender and a recipient, is unquestioned. === Phenomenological structuralism === Holenstein views Prague Structuralism as understood by Roman Jakobson (1896–1982) as a Husserlian structuralism expanded by dimensions of inter-subjectivity and of the unconscious that enlarge the understanding of the subject. According to Jakobson, phenomenology and structuralism form – in contrast to a dominant fashionable understanding – an inseparable unity. They are as interconnected, just as the participant and the observer perspectives as well as formal and semantic (i.e. content) aspects prove to be in language studies. Inspired by the Swiss philosopher Anton Marty, Jakobson, and Greenberg, Holenstein deals in depth with putative language universals and their possible understanding. === Philosophical psychology === From the start Holenstein's actual research interest in his studies of language centered on the relationship between experience, language, and thinking, later increasingly on that between \\"nature\\" and \\"mind\\", the traditional \\"mind-body\\" problem, and in connection with it on the heuristic function of the comparison between natural and artificial intelligence. Based on gestalt-psychology and cognitive science, he claimed early that the categorical structuring of perceiving and thinking is much less language-dependent than it was claimed during the early twentieth century in the heyday of linguistic relativism. Neurology may prove that the freedom of will as the basis of human action is imaginary, but it is incapable to prove that consciousness is not a psychological reality. Not only the outdated mechanistic physics as Descartes (1596–1650) conceived it but also today's physics is unable to explain consciousness. Therefore we have to admit that we do not know the inmost fabric of nature, its intima fabrica, as Albrecht von Haller (1708–1777) put it, that serves as origin of consciousness. In Holenstein's view an enlarged naturalist understanding of consciousness seems to be valid in psychology as well as in ethics. === Comparative cultural philosophy === Based on the methodological perspectives that Holenstein had gained in the years of his linguistic scholarly endeavors, he undertook the comparative investigation of cultural phenomena. Given the fluidity of research, he developed his philosophy of culture not in a systematic treatise, but in modular fashion. Central to his inquiry are cultural universals, the comparability of intra- and intercultural variations, and the indefensible view of the Romantics who regarded cultures as closed structural units. He strove to explain intra- and intercultural as well as intrapersonal conflicts and the impossibility of a simultaneous optimal realization of all value assumptions. He stressed further the importance of neighborly trans-regional relationships for historical change and an in-born ability of code switching for intercultural understanding. For Holenstein, Asia is not only a millennia old treasury of spirituality but also of secularism, of moral tenets embraced independently of religious persuasions. In courses his most often used essay is titled: \\"A Dozen Rules of Thumb for Avoiding Intercultural Misunderstanding.\\" === Philosophy atlas === New visual teaching aids motivated Holenstein to try \\"experimental cultural geography.\\" Geography shows what it shows in its spatial context. Therefore maps are especially suited to visualize that European philosophy is not understandable without its non-European context. Holenstein is committed to showing impressive philosophical developments in Asia beyond the so-called axial age. He also demonstrates that, like in Europe, the philosophical centers in China and India moved at different times to different regions. Holenstein finally also explores the ecological and economic basis of the diverse oral traditions of Africa and of the pre-invasion Americas. === Unique Swiss political traditions === The call to the ETH Zurich led Holenstein to complement his cultural philosophical investigations by a series of studies that relate to typical traits of the Swiss political system. Topics include positive aspects such as the peaceful coexistence of several language groups. This is supported by the international prestige of its two main minority languages and the actual privileging of all three of them, as well as by the fortunate fact that political, linguistic, denominational and economic frontiers do not coincide. He addressed issues, furthermore, concerning traditional social covenants such as agreements between employers’ and employees’ associations, mediation, mutual acceptance of diverse laws in the cantons, informal ideals like good faith and fairness, free movement, neutrality in case of a global conflict between civilizations, and the historical background of the invocation of God in the constitution's preamble. === Ethics === Like his language-oriented philosophical studies, also Holenstein's few texts that relate to ethics center on cognitive issues: Conscience, moral feelings, and sense of responsibility. They are intuitively experienced as binding. Although they are natural experiences the appeal to them does not (even not according to Kant) imply a naturalistic fallacy. Without them humans would have only an utilitaristic understanding of the categorical imperative. == Selected bibliography  Monographs === * , 1972. * Roman Jakobson’s Approach to Language: Phenomenological Structuralism, 1976 * , 1985 * , 2002 * , 2004 === Article collections === * , 1976. * , 1980. * , 1985. * , 1998. * , 2009. === Edited works === * Edmund Husserl, Logische Untersuchungen. 1.

The exact cause is unclear. A combination of consistent findings on physical examination, the presence of anti HMG-CoA reductase antibodies in a person with myopathy, evidence of muscle breakdown, and muscle biopsy diagnose SAAM. Treatment involves stopping the associated statin medication and taking medication to suppress the immune system. SAAM is estimated to occur in 2-3 people out of every 100,000 statin-treated individuals. It appears to be more common in people over the age of 50. ==Signs and symptoms== Severe weakness of the proximal muscles (shoulders, upper arms, thighs) on both sides of the body, very high blood levels of the enzyme creatine kinase (CK) being released by broken down skeletal muscle, and persistent symptoms and CK elevation despite stopping the offending statin medication are the hallmarks of SAAM. Other forms of statin associated muscle damage (myopathy) usually resolve after stopping the involved statin. Mild joint pain and rash may be present. In people affected by SAAM, the median duration of statin therapy was 38 months before the onset of muscular symptoms. SAAM may affect people after long-term statin use even if they had no previous muscular side effects. ==Pathogenesis== It is unclear precisely how statins lead to statin-associated autoimmune myopathy. The disorder is positively associated with HLA-DR11 and the DRB1*11:01 allele. There are likely other unidentified genetic and environmental risk factors associated with SAAM, given the prevalence of the DRB1 allele and the low incidence of autoimmunity in that group. Statins inhibit HMG-CoA reductase activity and consequently lower cholesterol levels in the blood. However, by doing this, they also increase the production of the HMG-CoA reductase protein. SAAM hypothetically triggers this increase in the production of HMG-CoA reductase and associated abnormal processing of this protein in genetically susceptible individuals. This abnormal processing theoretically triggers the generation of antibodies targeting the HMG-CoA reductase protein resulting in SAAM. Another theory postulates that the configuration of the HMG-CoA reductase protein may change when statin medications bind to it causing the protein to expose certain antigens that the immune system is not tolerant to resulting in the production of antibodies against it. ==Diagnosis== The development of necrotizing myopathy after statin exposure is insufficient to make the diagnosis. Testing must first exclude other causes of myositis and necrotizing myopathy. A muscle biopsy consistent with SAAM will demonstrate muscle cell death with muscle fiber regeneration and typically has few inflammatory cells. Immunohistochemistry testing may demonstrate additional pathologic features of SAAM. Such findings include the presence of endothelial cell membrane attack complex in non-necrotic muscle fibers and MHC class I expression. Antibodies against HMG-CoA reductase occur in 94% of affected individuals. These antibodies are known to also occur in people who do not take statin medications. Conversely, these antibodies are absent in people who take statin medications but do not have myopathy. Thus, the presence of anti-HMG CoA reductase antibodies in someone who uses a statin and has myopathy strongly supports the diagnosis. CK levels increase to 10-100 times above normal (2000-20,000 IU/L) in more than 90% of cases. Electromyography (EMG) typically demonstrates a myopathic pattern of findings. Muscle swelling may be seen on MRI imaging. ==Treatment== SAAM is treated by stopping the offending statin medication and taking immunosuppressive medications. In rare cases, affected people spontaneously improve after just stopping the implicated statin. However, most cases mandate the use of immunosuppressive medication. Corticosteroids are considered first-line treatment. Prednisone dosed at 1 milligram/kilogram of body weight daily is generally recommended. Corticosteroid therapy alone may be reasonable in cases of mild muscular weakness. More severe cases require the use of combined methotrexate, azathioprine, or mycophenolate with corticosteroids. Severe cases of SAAM may fail to respond to 8-12 weeks of combination therapy. Rituximab or intravenous immunoglobulin are recommended as add-on therapy in such cases. Intravenous immunoglobulin is an appropriate first-line therapy in select individuals. Suitable candidates for first-line intravenous immunoglobulin include people who have diabetes mellitus or who wish to avoid corticosteroid therapy. ==Prognosis== Proper treatment of SAAM often results in full recovery. Recovery can occur even with persistently elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels. Conversely, some people with SAAM do not regain full muscle strength despite the normalization of their CK levels. Once strength recovers, immunosuppressive medications should be tapered. Relapse remains possible during tapering efforts, and some people require long-term immunosuppression. An affected person is more likely to experience permanent muscle damage if they do not receive adequate treatment for a long time. Muscle weakness occurs due to the replacement of some muscle with fatty tissue. ==ReferencesExternal links== Category:C-Class medicine articles Category:Medication side effects Category:Rheumatology Category:Statins ","title":"Statin-associated autoimmune myopathy"},{"id":"61394511","text":"Arthur Dial (1930- ) is an American painter and sculptor living and working in Bessemer, Alabama. He is a part of the Dial family of artists, which include his older brother, Thornton Dial, and his nephews, Thornton Dial Jr., Richard Dial and Ronald Lockett. == Life == Arthur Dial and his older half-brother Thornton \\"Buck\\" Dial were born in Emelle, Alabama in Sumter County, Alabama. They were raised by their grandmother until Arthur was seven years old. After that, they were raised by their aunt, Lillian Bell, in Bessemer, Alabama, where Dial still lives today. Dial reached the third grade before foregoing school to join the workforce. His first job was at a sawmill, followed by a string of jobs with Water Works, Jefferson County, and the Pullman Standard boxcar factory before settling into a job with U.S. Pipe. Dial remained at U.S. Pipe (known as the \\"Pipe Shop\\") for thirty-seven years until he was forced to retire at 62 years old due to work-related pulmonary issues. == Career == Although Arthur Dial drew when he was a child, he became very invested in making art in adulthood. He sought a way to unwind and decompress after days working in the high stakes environment of the U.S. Pipe foundry and found refuge in gardening, fishing, and making art. He began using discarded materials from the foundry like scrap pipe. steel, and other materials to create people, animals, and religious icons. His studio is a shed adjacent to his home, which he called, his \\"home away from home\\": > \\"In the shed out back, my ideas get turned into something. That junkhouse > shed is my home away from home. I got my spinners and tackle box for > fishing, all my tools for gardening, all my chicken feed, medicine for the > chickens, and my boards, paint and materials for art making. I got a lot of > stuff out there. My shed is my pride and joy.\\" Dial created reliefs and paintings that narrowed in on a specific moment within the broader narrative that he wished to convey. He uses these moments, such as Eve reaching for the forbidden fruit or \\"George Wallace blockading the entrance to the University of Alabama in Montgomery,\\" to highlight historical or folkloric moments of extreme tension. Dial's focus on scenes of conflict in humanity's real or imagined history come from his direct observation of southern life throughout the 20th century. He describes his narratives as \\"a record of what went by\\" === Exhibitions and permanent collections === Dial's work has been documented in the following exhibitions: # Living Traditions: Southern Black Folk Art. 17 Aug- 27 Oct. 1991, The Museum of York County, Rock Hill, North Carolina. # Wrestling with History: A Celebration of African American Self-Taught Artists from the collection of Ronald and June Shelp. 1996, Baruch College, New York City. # Testimony: Vernacular Art of the African American South: The Ronald and June Shelp Collection. 15 Sep., 2000- Jan. 2004, Kalamazoo Institute of Arts, Kalamazoo, MI. # Southern Spirit: the Hill Collection. 21 Feb. 31 Mar. 2000, Museum of Art, Tallahassee, FL. # Stories of Community: Self-Taught Art from the Hill Collection. 12 Aug- 30 Oct. 2004.

She is the first Aboriginal woman to be hired to this position in any university across Australia. == Early life == Henderson-Yates was born in Derby, Western Australia, and was the eldest child in a family of eight. Her brother James Patrick Taylor went missing in 1974 after being seen entering the van of a white male and the case of his disappearance was never solved. Many years later, in 2014, Henderson-Yates prompted a re-opening of the investigation after it emerged that James Ryan O'Neill was in Derby around the time of James' disappearance. ==Career== She became a teaching assistant in the local area and continued to work her way up the education system over the next 35 years. By 2008 she was an associate professor at the University of Notre Dame and established the Nulungu Research Institute to study Indigenous Australians in a culturally sensitive manner. She became the first director of the centre. In 2009 she was appointed to the position of deputy-vice chancellor at Broome campus, University of Notre Dame, a milestone for Aboriginal women. Two years later, as a result of these achievements, Henderson-Yates was awarded the Person of the Year award by the National Aboriginal Islander Day Observance Committee of Kullari Region. Student numbers at the small university campus were in decline, which resulted in Henderson-Yates and colleagues having to slash back the number of staff in 2010. However in 2012 the campus unveiled a new classroom to help improve the literacy skills of local Aboriginal students. As part of her research she co- wrote a 2014 report into university accessibility to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, entitled \\"You Can't Be What You Can't See\\", as well as a book about reconciliation in Australia called Take Off Your Shoes, Walk On The Ground: The Journey Towards Reconciliation in Australia. Henderson-Yates is also CEO of the Derby Aboriginal Health Service, which provides support and education of healthcare to the indigenous Australians of the region. Aboriginal people in the area suffer from high rates of mental illness and suicide numbers are abnormally high. The DAHS works to resolve these issues, but it struggles with the extensive funding this requires, which the government is reluctant to provide. == References == Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Australian women academics Category:People from Derby, Western Australia ","title":"Lyn Henderson-Yates"},{"id":"61394705","text":"Rantso Alfred Mokopane (born 8 August 1994) is a South African runner specialising in the 3000 metres steeplechase.

He is particularly famous for his icons. ==Biography== Aleksije Lazović was born in Bijelo Polje, Montenegro, to Serbian parents; the son of the painter Simeon Lazović. Among the works painted by Aleksije Lazović is the iconostasis of the Church of the Dormition-of-the-Mother-of-God at the Reževići Monastery, near Petrovac na Moru or the Uspanie Bogomatere Church in Šibenik, Croatia. With his father, he painted the iconostasis of Saint Demetrius and Saint Nicholas chapels at the Dečani monastery in Kosovo and the iconostasis of the Savina monastery church near Herceg Novi. He is also the author of an icon of the Virgin, painted in 1806 and in imitation of a painting attributed to Saint Luke; this work is preserved in the Museum Treasury of the Patriarchate of Peć. Works by Aleksije Lazović are also preserved in the churches of Dobroselica, Mačkat and Bela Reka on the Zlatibor mountains, and theiconostasis he painted in the Monastery of Nikoljac in Bijelo Polje in 1837. The iconostases of Dečani are the most grandiose works and most beautiful of Simeon and Alexis Lazović who, between 1764 and 1837, executed numerous iconostasis in churches in Dalmatia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia. Being given their conceptions of pictorial art, these painters of icons were the continuators of iconography's post-Byzantine tradition, adapting models to the taste of their customers by modernizing them, that is, using the post-Baroque form practiced by engravers and painters who worked the territory subject to the spiritual authority of the Metropolitanate of Karlovci. The iconostasis of the Dečani Monastery, to a large extent, complements the image of the diverse activity of the painters Lazović and allows us to judge with more objectivity their work which translates faithfully the social and spiritual conditions in which they have lived and displayed their talents. ==Gallery== File:Aleksije Lazović - Saint Sava, Saint Symeon and Stefan the First-Crowned, 1819.jpgSaint Sava, Saint Symeon and Stefan the First-Crowned, 1819 File:Aleksije Lazović - Christ, emperor of emperors and great archpriest, 1819.jpgChrist, emperor of emperors and great archpriest, 1819 ==See also== * Simeon Lazović * List of painters from Serbia == References == Category:18th-century Serbian painters Category:19th-century Serbian painters Category:Icon painters Category:1774 births Category:1837 deaths Category:People from Bijelo Polje ","title":"Aleksije Lazović"},{"id":"61394756","text":"Darin Burns is a former professional Canadian football defensive lineman. == Playing career == Burns began his career playing junior football for the Etobicoke Argonauts, Hamilton Hurricanes, and Burlington Braves (Hamilton Tiger-Cats' Junior affiliate team).

After success in competitions, and concert and broadcast appearances in New Zealand he won a scholarship to the Royal College of Music (RCM) in London. He was spotted by Lilian Baylis, proprietor of Sadler's Wells Opera and made his debut with that company while still a student, playing Faninal in Der Rosenkavalier in 1939.Forbes, Elizabeth. \\"Obituary: Denis Dowling\\", The Independent, 25 September 1996. At the RCM Dowling was the first singer to be awarded the Tagore Gold Medal for the best all-round student of the year, hitherto won exclusively by instrumental players. His career had to be put on hold while he served in the Second World War as an officer in the Royal Artillery. In 1943 he married Phyllis Clutterbuck. After demobilisation, in 1947 Dowling joined the new English Opera Group, singing Junius in Britten's The Rape of Lucretia and Sid in the same composer's Albert Herring at Glyndebourne, Covent Garden and on a European tour. In 1948 he returned to Sadler's Wells, playing Silvio in Pagliacci. His career with Sadler's Wells lasted until his retirement, at the end of an American tour, in 1984, when he was seventy-four. Among his many roles were Escamillo and Dancairo in Carmen, Dr Falke in Die Fledermaus, Angelotti in Tosca, Sharpless in Madam Butterfly, Baron Douphol and Germont in La Traviata, and Marcello in La Boheme. He became noted for his versatility, but was particularly well known for his performances in comic roles. In the words of The Times: :He excelled in the title role of a famous production of The Barber of Seville, directed by Tyrone Guthrie. Taddeo in The Italian Girl in Algiers followed, as did Dandini in Cenerentola . The latter performance was among his finest, matched perhaps by a suave Malatesta in Don Pasquale and the monocled peer, Earl Mountararat, in Gilbert and Sullivan's Iolanthe. In an obituary in The Independent, Elizabeth Forbes wrote: :Dowling clocked up a vast number of performances of more than 100 different roles. A skilful comedian, with a flexible lyric baritone voice, he excelled in Mozart and Rossini, but he was equally convincing as the sadistic Prison Camp Commandant in Janáček's From the House of the Dead or the Secret Police Agent in Menotti's The Consul and as Baron Mirko Zeta in The Merry Widow or Pooh Bah in The Mikado. From 1974 until his retirement, Dowling added the position of vocal consultant to the ENO to his singing roles. He died in London on 23 September 1996 at the age of eighty-six. ==References== Category:1910 births Category:1996 deaths Category:New Zealand opera singers Category:New Zealand expatriates in the United Kingdom ","title":"Denis Dowling"},{"id":"61394826","text":"The 1994 Stevenage Borough Council election took place on 5 May 1994.

A singing translation into English is The Lone Rock which differs in some small details. Carraig Aonair is better known in English as the Fastnet Rock, about southwest of Cape Clear Island, County Cork in Ireland. ==Events== Some time after 1691, Finin, Cormac and Donal, the sons of Conchbhar O laoghaire (Conor O'Leary) along with their unnamed brother-in-law set off on a fishing trip a few days before Christmas to get a New Year's gift of fish. During the trip something went wrong, neither version is explicit but the Irish words refer to a \\"deceptive calm\\" when they set off. The boat was wrecked upon the Fastnet rock. All four men reached the rock, but the rising tide doomed them. Their father was grief- stricken and the song is his lament. ==Song== provides both the English versification and a literal translation of the original Irish. The Irish original is posted earlier on the same website. The first verse sets the scene; they set off shortly before day-break with the sea a \\"deceptive calm\\" (Irish), \\"Calm and peaceful\\" (English). Verse 2 relates that Donal, the youngest, was washed up on the shore two weeks later. Verse 3 relates that Thomas managed to scratch a description of what had happened by using his shoe buckle on the rudder of the wrecked boat. The verse ends with Thomas saying that the rock would be his spouse (Irish) or lover (English) for ever. Verse 4 mentions Cormac, then verse 5 refers to a joyless Christmas and laments that the four men could not be buried in Aghadown [Aughadown?] churchyard. In the next two verses the father wishes that his sons had joined the Wild Geese and gone abroad to France or Spain, they would not then be wedded to the rock. Conor then tells his daughter not to grieve, she'll find another husband but he'll never find his sons again. He describes himself as \\"withered and gaunt\\" before complaining that his second wife (the boys' step-mother) doesn't understand his grief. Even in church he is reminded of where they used to kneel and in the final verse the motif of being wedded to the rock returns in the last line. ==Dating== The reference in both the Irish and English versions to the \\"Wild Geese\\" alludes to the Flight of the Wild Geese. Following the Treaty of Limerick (3 October 1691) the Jacobite soldiers left Ireland to serve in French and Spanish armies. The term was also applied more generally to Irish soldiers who left to serve in continental European armies in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries. ==Melody== \\\\relative c' { \\\\language \\"english\\" \\\\key e \\\\major \\\\time 3/4 \\\\tempo \\"Andante con moto.\\" 4=90 \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = bagpipe % Appropriate tone - can't decide which is best! \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = recorder % Also appropriate - can't decide which is best! \\\\partial 4 e8.\\\\\\\\( fs16  g4 a e8 fs8  g2\\\\\\\\) e8\\\\\\\\( e8  g4 a8 b8 d4  e2\\\\\\\\) e4\\\\\\\\(  d4 b b8. a16  b16 d8. b4 a8. g16  fs4 e e  e2\\\\\\\\) e8.\\\\\\\\( fs16  g4 a e8 fs8  g2\\\\\\\\) e4\\\\\\\\(  g4 a8 b8 d4  e2\\\\\\\\) e4\\\\\\\\(  d4 b b8. a16  b16 d8. b4 a8. g16  fs4 e e e2\\\\\\\\) \\\\bar \\".\\" } %%%%%%%%%%%%%%% %HELP - this section needs help from a musical Irish speaker %to sort out the phrasing. % % \\\\addlyrics { % Ó!

Allan Goodson (c.1870–c.1926), who worked traplines in the wilderness from Prince George along the Robson Valley, went missing. Emmet Baxter (Shorty) Haynes (?–1953) guided the initial police search to the subject's cabin, which was in an area upstream from Dome Creek (probably closer to Urling) on the Fraser. Comments Goodson had previously made to James Stewart at Dome Creek, and notes in his cabin, indicated that Haynes had threatened his life. Further searches revealed no traces of a body and it remains a cold case.Prince George Citizen: 11 Mar 1926 & 13 May 1926 Five years later, when Haynes was two weeks overdue in checking in at the Dome Creek post-office, concerns arose as to the popular trapper's wellbeing.Prince George Citizen, 14 May 1931 By 1914, Haynes, was described as a well-known old-timer, who was over six-foot tall. Research by novelist Jack Boudreau of Penny indicated that Goodson was suspected of stealing from others' traplines. Apparently, Haynes and Goodson had been feuding for years. At a secretive meeting of trappers at Dome Creek, Haynes volunteered to deal with the matter, but because of his popularity, nobody snitched on him. In 1928, while riding in the vicinity, Haynes shattered his leg when his horse stumbled and fell upon him.Prince George Citizen, 2 Aug 1928 On his death, Haynes, who served in World War I, had worked in many central B.C. locations.Fort George Herald, 11 Apr 1914Prince George Citizen: 23 Jul 1919, 5 Feb 1953 & 27 Nov 2009 Robert Blangy accumulated a record for theft, escape from custody, imprisonment, impaired driving and fines.Prince George Citizen: 18 Jan 1934, 25 Jan 1934, 3 Dec 1936, 4 & 18 Feb 1937, 9 Nov 1939, 28 Sep 1944, 5 Oct 1944, 28 Sep 1950 & 8 Jul 1966 His sibling Ernest amassed convictions for forgery, assault, public intoxication, possession of stolen goods, theft, and impaired driving, without a licence, insurance or due care.

Sins of the Flesh: A History of Ethical Vegetarian Thought. UBC Press. p. 13. Newton's book was written to popularize the research of William Lambe. He promoted a \\"regimen of distilled water and vegetable diet.\\" He believed that vegetables are the natural food of man and animal flesh is unhealthy and unnatural. Newton recommended people to utilize distillation apparatus for their water. He resided at Chester Street, Belgravia and argued that the water from the River Thames was polluted by \\"animal oil\\" and \\"septic matter\\". His diet was ovo- lacto vegetarian and consisted of fruits, vegetables, raisins, toasted bread, distilled water, eggs, milk and potatoes. Twenty-five people were practicing the diet in 1811, including seven from Newton's own household and all reported good health. Newton's book inspired John Snow to adopt the diet. Unlike William Lambe, Newton was not a vegan. Newton commented that: > Our breakfast is composed of dried fruits, whether raisins, figs, or plums, > with toasted bread or biscuits, and weak tea, always made of distilled > water, with a moderation portion of milk in it... When butter is added to > the toast, it is in a very small quantity. The dinner consists of potatoes, > with some other vegetables, according as they happen to be in season, > macaroni, a tart, or a pudding, with as few eggs in it as possible: to this > is sometimes added a dessert.Newton, John Frank.

It underlies the Roca Formation and overlies the Allen Formation. All of these formations belong to the Malargüe Group. Its name was coined by Windhausen in 1914. This unit, defined in the eastern area of the Neuquén Embayment, registers an event of marine flooding that happened during the ages Maastrichtian and Danian.Rodríguez, María Fernanda (2011). «El Grupo Malargüe (Cretácico Tardío-Paleógeno Temprano) en la Cuenca Neuquina». Relatorio del XVIII Congreso Geológico Argentino (Neuquén): 245-264. It consists of mudrocks formed between the upper section or \\"Gypsum\\" of the Allen Formation, and the base of the first organogenic limestone of the Roca Formation. The Jagüel Formation is particularly important since a vast area of the formation contains the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary that marks the end of the Mesozoic Era. It also shows evidence of the Cretaceous–Paleogene (K–Pg) extinction event. In this period of time, animal species became extinct, such as non–avian dinosaurs, the last marine reptiles, ammonites, and many groups of microfossils. == Area distribution == The main outcrops of the Jagüel Formation are found in the inner sectors of the Neuquén Basin, where the \\"Rocanense Sea\\" reached its maximum depth. In the Andean region, it crops out in the south of Mendoza, where its fossil content dates back to the age Maastrichtian. In the area of Huantraico (Neuquén), the Jagüel Formation crops out at Cerro Villegas, where it is thick. Moreover, its outcrops are partially covered in the eastern flank of Añelo low (sector Lomas Coloradas–sierras Blanca), in the surrounding area of Pellegrini Lake, in the hills to the north of Río Negro extending to General Roca. Having reduced outcrops, it can be observed in the surroundings of Casa de Piedra reservoir. Due to its fine and homogeneous lithology, its outcrops have few morphological features and they are often partially covered. == Lithology == The Jagüel Formation consists of monotonous olive green and yellowish mudrocks (claystones, siltstones, mudstones), traversed by thin veins of fibrous gypsum. These veins are found on the meteorized surface and they give distinct brightness to the outcrops. The claystones are plastic and friable, with waxy brightness. Some of them are laminated, while the siltstones are grayish. With these distinct characteristics, it crops out in its type locality (Jagüel de Rosauer) and at Lomas Coloradas, where the unit is 18–26 m thick (59–85 ft). The outcrops around Pellegrini Lake keep the typical characteristics of the unit. Olive green calcareous mudrocks appear in the northern sector of the lake, which are solid and friable with fragmentary remains of molluscs (oysters). In this sector, there is also abundant fossil content composed of scallops and small brachiopods. Besides, there is an important microfaunal assemblage from the mid–Maastrichtian. In this area, it has a maximum thickness of 30 m (98 ft). In the hills located in the north of General Roca (type locality of the Roca Formation), the outcrops of the Jagüel Formation are very friable, and they are covered by rock fragments from upper layers of the same unit. They are brown–olive. They make up the base of the hills and have the typical aspect of this unit. The boundary with the overlying Roca Formation is marked by yellowish resistant limestones. Finally, the lower part of the Jagüel Formation crops out above the southern margin of Casa de Piedra reservoir. It is composed of brown–ochre mudrocks, with many veins of gypsum at the base, and a thin layer of highly fossiliferous limestones that lies 1 m (3 ft) above its contact with the Allen Formation. The outcropping thickness of the unit is 25 m (82 ft). Dark brown friable mudstones crop out above the northern shore of the reservoir, with remaining molluscs in the lower part, near the shore. In the upper section, there are ochre mudrocks which are gypseous, and its outcrops are partially covered; there, its thickness is 20 m (66 ft). In this sector, the Jagüel Formation is covered unconformably by the Vaca Mahuida Formation. In the area of Huantraico, there are greenish calcareous mudstones, with thin intercalations of calcareous sandstones; the mudstones are solid or laminated. The lithofacies characteristics of the unit suggest an outer continental shelf environment, below the normal wave base. == Age and correlations == The micropaleontological content of the Jagüel Formation made it possible to classify it as Maastrichtian–Danian (Early and Late). This formation conformably overlies the Allen Formation and it also conformably underlies the Roca Formation . The Pircala–El Carrizo Formation lies above these formations. All of them belong to the Malargüe Group. == Fossil content  Microfossils === The Jagüel Formation, aged Maastrichtian and Danian, constitutes the peak of the transgression within the Malargüe Group, reaching maximum depths of a mid–outer shelf environment. It has abundant marine microfossils, such as planktonic and benthic foraminifera, calcareous ostracods and nannofossils, as well as dinoflagellates. Generally, they are well preserved. The micropaleontological record of the Jagüel Formation is of paramount importance since this unit contains the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary in different localities, which marks the Cretaceous–Paleogene (K–Pg) extinction event. === Reptiles === The record of faunal marine reptiles include mosasaurs and the marine turtle Euclastes meridionalis. === Macroinvertebrates === As a result of a taxonomic revision of the Cretaceous–Paleogene (K–Pg) boundary, oysters in the Neuquén Basin, in the west of Argentina, it was mentioned that there were Pycnodonte (Phygraea) vesicularis, Amphidonte mendozana, Ostrea wilckensi, Gyrostrea lingua, Ambigostrea clarae, and Gryphaeostrea callophyla. Moreover, it was observed that there were other specimens, like bivalves, gastropods, irregular echinoids, bryozoans, and decapods. == Depositional environment == The Jagüel Formation contains marine deposits accumulated in inner positions of the basin, with depths that vary from a mid to an outer continental shelf. Sedimentological and paleontological evidence suggests a predominance of normal atmospheric conditions, below the normal wave base and with optimal circulation, away from the sources of detritus supply. == References  External links == * International Commission on Stratigraphy * International Chronostratigraphic Chart v2018/08 Category:Geologic formations of Argentina Category:Maastrichtian Stage of South America Category:Cretaceous Argentina Category:Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary Category:Paleocene Series of South America Category:Paleogene Argentina Category:Danian Stage Category:Malargüe Group Category:Shale formations Category:Siltstone formations Category:Mudstone formations Category:Open marine deposits Category:Paleontology in Argentina ","title":"Jagüel Formation"},{"id":"61395009","text":"The South Ethiopic languages are a family of many languages spoken throughout Ethiopia.

John Harrison. It is Harrison's debut novel, and was originally published in 1971. The book is dedicated to Michael Moorcock and Moorcock's wife Hilary Bailey. == Synopsis == In a dystopian Britain, social organization has collapsed, and the survivors, riddled with skin cancers, eke out a precarious scavenging existence in the ruins of the Great Society. A few bizarre communities try to maintain their structure in a chromium wilderness linked by crumbling motorways. But their rituals are meaningless cliches mouthed against the devastation. Only the roaming bands of hippie-style situationists have grasped that the old order, with its logic, its pseudo-liberalism and its immutable laws of cause and effect, has now been superseded. Among the mutants are a group of reptilian humans - alien, cancer-free but persecuted by the 'smoothskins'. When one of them is born of a human mother in Tinhouse, a group of humans sets off to deliver it to its own kind - a search of the committed men for the tribes of mutants. == Reception == Writing in The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction, science fiction specialist John Clute wrote, \\"[The Committed Men] is an impressive Post-Holocaust story set in a fractured England, centering physically on the ruins of the motorways, and generating a powerful sense of entropic dismantlement.\\" A Kirkus reviewer wrote, \\"It erupts into the kind of savagery and grotesquerie that John Christopher used to specialize in, as Wendover, a doctor, finally finds himself trying to save a mutant baby from his own kind.\\" David Pringle called the novel \\"brief, bleak, derivative - but stylishly written.\\" == Possible film adaptation == In a 2018 interview Harrison revealed that he had been approached about a film adaption, which he declined. Explaining his decision: \\"I was less interested in shuffling and dealing than in saying something. I got an offer for the film rights of The Committed Men, but when I saw the treatment I found they had reversed its conclusions.

Fitzhugh Mullan (July 22, 1942 – November 29, 2019) was an American physician, writer, educator, and social activist. He participated in the founding of the Student Health Organization, the National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship, Seed Global Health, and the Beyond Flexner Alliance. Mullan was a professor of Health Policy and Management and of Pediatrics at the George Washington University and the George Washington University Health Workforce Institute, now renamed the Fitzhugh Mullan Institute for Health Workforce Equity. He was an elected member of the National Academy of Medicine. == Early career == Fitzhugh Mullan's father and grandfather were physicians. He grew up in New York City where he attended the Dalton School. He studied history at Harvard and medicine at the University of Chicago. Mullan's activism started during medical school in the 1960s when he spent time in Mississippi as a civil rights worker with the Medical Committee for Human Rights. He was a leader of the Student Health Organization during his time as a medical student, an organizer of the Lincoln Collective at Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx while a pediatric resident, and the president of the Committee of Interns and Residents in New York City from 1971–72. These events are captured in his memoir about the period, White Coat, Clenched Fist: The Political Education of an American Physician. Mullan joined the United States Public Health Service in 1972 and spent three years practicing medicine in a community clinic in New Mexico as one of the first members of the National Health Service Corps, a program of which he subsequently became director. He later returned to New Mexico and served as Secretary of Health and Environment for Governor Toney Anaya, worked for Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, ran the Federal Bureau of Health Professions, and attained the rank of Assistant Surgeon General. In 1989, he published Plagues and Politics: The Story of the United States Public Health Service, a volume still used to orient new officers to the Commissioned Corps of the USPHS. == Health policy == In 1996, Mullan retired from the US Public Health Service and went to work as a writer/editor at the health policy journal Health Affairs, where he founded a monthly column entitled “Narrative Matters”. He believed that people's understanding of policy issues was often determined by experience and anecdote so a policy journal should provide space for personal narratives that carry policy messages. Mullan wrote the first column himself, entitled “Me and the System,” and he edited a 2006 anthology, Narrative Matters: The Power of the Personal Essay in Health Policy. During his time at Health Affairs, Mullan began to practice pediatrics again at an inner city health center in Washington, DC and wrote about his experiences in a series of pieces in Health Affairs and the Washington Post. In 2002, he published Big Doctoring: Profiles in Primary Care, a book of oral histories gathered from primary care physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants in an effort to capture the beauty and plight of primary care providers. == Academic career == In 2005, Mullan was appointed professor of Health Policy and Management and professor of Pediatrics at the George Washington University. His research focuses on health workforce and health equity. From 2008–10, he led the Gates Foundation-funded Sub-Saharan African Medical School Study and from 2010–15, he directed the Coordinating Center for the Medical Education Partnership Initiative, a $135 million US government investment in medical education in Sub-Saharan Africa. He published a 2010 paper called The Social Mission of Medical Education: Ranking the Schools. In 2012, he founded the Beyond Flexner Alliance, an inter-professional organization dedicated to promoting social mission in health care education programs, and he served as the chair of the organization's Board of Directors from 2012–19. He worked with Vanessa Kerry to create SEED Global Health, of which he served as the founding Board Chair, 2011–12. In 2015, he co-founded the George Washington Health Workforce Institute, which was renamed the Fitzhugh Mullan Institute for Health Workforce Equity] in 2019 in recognition of Mullan's lifetime of work on behalf of health equity. With support from the Atlantic Philanthropies, Mullan initiated the George Washington University- based Leaders for Health Equity Fellowship program, now known as the Atlantic Fellows for Health Equity. == Cancer survivorship == Mullan was diagnosed with cancer in his chest in 1975. He chronicled his experience with surgeries, chemotherapy and radiation in the book, Vital Signs: A Young Doctor's Struggle with Cancer, which was published in 1983. This book and his article, \\"Seasons of Survival: Reflections of a Physician with Cancer\\" helped propel the cancer survivorship movement. Mullan and his fellow survivor colleagues formed the National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship in 1986. Mullan served as president and then chair of the NCCS Board of Directors from 1986–93. == References == Category:1942 births Category:2019 deaths Category:Physicians from New York City Category:Harvard University alumni Category:Pritzker School of Medicine alumni Category:George Washington University faculty Category:Dalton School alumni ","title":"Fitzhugh Mullan"},{"id":"61395100","text":"Gloria Olienka Giovanna Salinas López (born 16 November 1973), known as Olienka Salinas, is a Peruvian former football and futsal player and current manager.

Ørsted was Denmark's leading jurist of the mid-19th century. He served as Prime Minister of Denmark in 1853–54. ==Description== The monument consists of a bronze sculpture standing on a granite plinth and measures . Ørsted is depicted as an ancient wise man, sitting on a klismos and wearing a toga. He is shown in a moment of quiet contemplation, resting his left arm on the back of the chair and his chin against his hand. Under the chair stands a casket with scrolls. The casket is decorated with a relief depicting the scene where \\"Memesis reads the deeds of man aloud to Jupiter\\" (\\"Nemesis oplæser menneskenes gerninger for Jupiter\\"). ==History== Vilhelm Bissen's marble copy of his father's 1837 plaster statue The statue was originally commissioned from Herman Wilhelm Bissen at the initiative of the art historian Niels Laurits Høyen. Bissen created a small statuette in 1835–36 and the original plaster model in 1836–37. The plan was to raise 6,000 Danish rigsdaler for a marble statue but Ørsted's strong political views resulted in dwindling popularity. Orla Lehmann wrote to Høyen that Ørsted wasn't a statesman but \\"the servant of a Fürst\\". In 1842, Høyen made a new attempt to raise the money but Ørsted that same year went up against who had spoken Danish at the ' in Slesvig. This prompted Høyen to call off the fund-raising campaign. Bissen, who was known for his temper, was outraged. In about 1852, he was supposedly about the destroy the model but was stopped by force by a group of his students. Bissen died in 1868 and thus never got to see the statue completed. Vilhelm Bissen his son and student, continued his father's studio. He sold his father's Ørsted plaster model to Carl Jacobsen in 1882. In 1885, Jacobsen also commissioned a marble copy from him. The outdoor monument was commissioned in connection with the 10th Nordic Jurist Meeting and financed through donations from Danish and Norwegian jurists. The bronze statue was based on Bissen Jr.'s 1885 marble copy and cast in Lauritz Rasmussen's Bronze Foundry. It was unveiled during the conference on 27 August 1902. == References External links== * 1837 statue (plaster) in Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek at Kunstindeks Danmark * 1885 statue (marble) in the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek at Kunstindeks Danmark * PDF about the Nordic Jurist Meetings, 1872-1972 Category:Monuments and memorials in Copenhagen Category:Outdoor sculptures in Copenhagen Category:Sculptures of men in Denmark Category:Bronze sculptures in Denmark Category:Sculptures by Herman Wilhelm Bissen Category:1937 sculptures Category:1902 establishments in Denmark Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1902 ","title":"Statue of Anders Sandøe Ørsted"},{"id":"61395156","text":"Attilio Sorbi (born 7 February 1959) is an Italian football manager and former player who is currently manager of Inter Women. ==Playing career== Throughout his career he played as a midfielder for Montevarchi, Ternana, Roma, Pisa, Padova, Bologna, Venezia-Mestre, Cavese, Battipagliese and Rondinella. ==Coaching career== On 23 July 2019, Sorbi was appointed head coach of Inter Women. ==References== Category:1959 births Category:Living people Category:Ternana Calcio players Category:A.S.

The rights would be divided as follows: * Fox became the exclusive broadcaster of the Daytona 500 and also hold the rights to the first thirteen points paying races. In addition, the network carried the Sprint Unlimited and two Truck Series races (the network aired the Kroger 250 from Martinsville Speedway, and the Ohio 250 at Mansfield Motorsports Park in 2007; and the Kroger 250 from Martinsville, as well as the San Bernardino County 200 at Auto Club Speedway, in both 2008 and 2009). Fox did not air any races of what is now the Gander Outdoors Truck Series from 2010 to 2013, with all 25 races instead airing on Speed. Fox's 2011 coverage ended with the STP 400 at Kansas Speedway. * TNT carried six NASCAR Cup Series races during the month of June and the first half of July, including the Coke Zero 400 at Daytona. In 2013, in particular, the network aired Pocono Raceway, Michigan International Speedway, Sonoma Raceway, Kentucky Speedway, the Coke Zero 400, and New Hampshire Motor Speedway. * ESPN and ABC (through the ESPN on ABC arrangement) carried the final seventeen NASCAR Cup Series races from the Brickyard 400 through the end of the season, with the Cup Series Chase for the Championship races airing on ABC (until 2010, when ESPN took over most of the coverage, leaving ABC with the last 3 Saturday night races in their broadcasting period). The entire Nationwide season was aired primarily on ESPN2 and ESPN, with selected races on ABC, NASCAR returned to ESPN airing the first six races including Daytona, Atlanta, Las Vegas, and ESPN2 carrying Phoenix to Michigan. * Speed/Fox Sports 1 carried the Budweiser Duel races and the Sprint All-Star Race, as well as the entire Camping World Truck Series season, except for the 2 races carried each year by Fox from 2007 to 2009. After the 2009 season, all the Truck races aired on Speed/FS1 – with the exception of the 2014 Talladega race, which aired on Fox. ==Year-by-year summary2010=== Fox Sports, their corporate sibling Speed, TNT, and ESPN/ABC are in the fourth year of a seven-year television contract scheduled to expire after the 2014 season. Showtime is going to show a highlights show for the first time. *Fox - Fox Sports broadcast the first 13 races, including the Budweiser Shootout, the 52nd Daytona 500, and the Coca-Cola 600. With Dover moving to mid-May, Fox ended their coverage with the 51st Coca-Cola 600. The Sprint All-Star Race XXVI along with the Gatorade Duels, practice sessions, and all qualifying and practice sessions (except for Daytona qualifying, which aired on Fox) were all broadcast on Speed. The network's Gopher Cam mascot, Digger, returned for on- screen displays. *TNT - Time Warner's Turner Sports division (through TNT) broadcast the next six races, including the Coke Zero 400 at Daytona in its limited commercial interruption wide open coverage format. That race will also be telecast in 3-D on both NASCAR.com and DirecTV. TNT's coverage will begin with the June Pocono race and end with Chicagoland. Qualifying and practice sessions will remain on Speed. Adam Alexander will be the new lead announcer, with Lindsay Czarniak hosting pre-and-post-race shows, replacing Bill Weber and Marc Fein respectively. *ESPN/ABC - ESPN carried the remaining races, beginning with the Brickyard 400. ABC, which formerly carried the last 11 races of the season, will carry the Saturday night races in Bristol, Richmond, and Charlotte. Although previously races could not be moved from ABC to ESPN, early start times and ABC's plans to expand its Sunday morning political shows meant that NASCAR had to allow most Chase races to move to ESPN. This was met from criticism from most of ABC's southern-based affiliates, who had originally counted on NASCAR on those Sundays for ratings gains against the NFL. Most qualifying sessions will air on ESPN2, practice sessions and some qualifying will be shared by SPEED and ESPN2. Qualifying for the Pep Boys Auto 500 and AMP Energy 500 aired on Speed because they are Saturday afternoon sessions during the college football season. Additionally, Jerry Punch was replaced in the play-by-play position by Marty Reid; Punch returned to the pits where he worked at ESPN until 2000. *Showtime - CBS-owned pay cable premium service Showtime carried a weekly one-hour highlight show titled Inside NASCAR every Wednesday at 10 pm ET/PT, with the series premiere on February 10. Chris Myers, who also hosts FOX's NASCAR coverage, will serve as host, joined by SPEED's Randy Pemberton & Michael Waltrip, and ESPN's Brad Daugherty, with the shows taping at the NASCAR Hall of Fame Studio 43. 38 episodes are planned, covering the season. In NASCAR on ESPNs advertising campaign, their slogan was \\"Feel your heart race\\", a slogan which had already been trademarked by Kyle Petty's Victory Junction Gang. The latter's advertising also appeared on ESPN-carried races. This was changed to \\"Cause it's Racing\\" in 2010 and \\"Nothing Beats First Place\\" in 2011 and 2012. During ESPN's broadcasts since 2010, several improvements were made, including reduction in technology. There were also changes in announcing and pit reporters, most notably the moving Dr. Jerry Punch to pit road and IndyCar and occasional Nationwide Series lead announcer Marty Reid to lead broadcaster for the majority of NASCAR broadcasts beginning in 2010, including the Sprint Cup races. Sponsorship by non-NASCAR sponsors was also reduced. Allen Bestwick, formerly the lap-by-lap announcer for NBC's NASCAR coverage from 2001 to 2004, took over as lead broadcaster for Sprint Cup Series races in 2011. Once the Chase for the Sprint Cup began and even in the races leading up to the Chase, ESPN often shifted its focus to the drivers in the Chase, in particular Jimmie Johnson. Often if a driver not in the Chase was leading and was passed for the lead by a Chase driver, he was not spoken of again for the rest of the broadcast. Case in point: in the November 2009 race in Texas, the vast majority of the broadcast was spent talking about Jimmie Johnson despite the fact he crashed on lap 3 and finished 38th. This was a fear of many once the Chase was introduced. Finally, in 2010 ESPN, with the consent of NASCAR, changed the networks that races were broadcast on. While the final eleven races of the season were broadcast on ABC from 2007–2009, all Sprint Cup races except for the three Saturday Night races in ESPN's portion of the schedule were switched to ESPN (the Bristol night race, previously on ESPN, was moved to ABC). This left only 3 races on over-the-air broadcasters for the last two- thirds of the NASCAR season. This, combined with the moving of the Brickyard 400, arguably NASCAR's second biggest race to ESPN, angered fans and sponsors. Due to ESPN's various sports commitments, there were several interferences with NASCAR broadcasts. This was especially true once college football season started, when Nationwide Series races would often follow an early college football game. The broadcast start had also been delayed by the Little League World Series and ATP tennis. Many times (at least 15 as of 2010), NASCAR Countdown and even the start of the race were moved to ESPN Classic or, later, ESPNEWS. Due to contractual agreements with Turner, ESPN could not put broadcasts with ESPN3.com, another fact that angered fans. However, in 2011 an agreement was reached letting ESPN put all NASCAR programming on WatchESPN. In 2010, because of the movement of the Chase races to ESPN and the earlier standardized 1:00 PM ET start times instituted by NASCAR, ESPN moved NASCAR Countdown to ESPN2 for all Chase races starting at 1:00 PM ET to avoid shortening or moving its Sunday NFL Countdown program. Viewers had to switch to the race at 1:00 PM ET from ESPN2 to ESPN. The next year, NASCAR moved the Chase races to later times (2:00 ET, then 3:00 ET for the final three races; Martinsville maintained a 1:30 PM ET starting time because, at the time, that track lacked lights and the grandstands cast long shadows over the racing surface in the late afternoon). ===2011=== From the 2011 Budweiser Shootout to 2015, Fox used the Fox NFL theme song in NASCAR telecasts. In addition, country superstar Dierks Bentley unveiled a new version of his hit song \\"Sideways\\", with new lyrics referencing NASCAR – which is played during the introduction of the pre-race show. \\"Sideways\\" was phased out entirely with the 2013 Sprint Unlimited telecast, with the Fox NFL theme music being used full- time. In addition, a new CGI introduction sequence, produced by Blur Studio, made its debut. In 2011, Pizza Hut became the presenting sponsor of the pre- race show on Fox. In addition, the first segment of the telecast was moved from the hotel to a tented facility either trackside or in the infield, depending on the venue. The idea was to build a crowd around the production of the segment; this has similarities to Fox's own NFL pregame show in 2006, as well as the College GameDay football and basketball shows on ESPN. ===2012=== In 2012, John Roberts filled in for Chris Myers as host for the Budweiser Shootout and the Daytona 500, as Myers was on bereavement leave following his son's death in a motorcycle accident. For the 2014 Sprint Unlimited, Michael Waltrip filled in for Darrell, who was undergoing gallbladder surgery; for Daytona 500 Practice and Pole Qualifying, the position was filled by Phil Parsons. Darrell Waltrip returned for the Budweiser Duels. In 2016, Jeff Gordon replaced McReynolds in the booth while McReynolds was reassigned as the rules and technical analyst, replacing Andy Petree. In October 2012, NASCAR extended its contract with Fox Sports through 2022, which allowed Fox the online streaming rights for its event telecasts; the Fox Sports contract also retains coverage of the first 13 races of the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series and exclusive coverage of the Daytona 500. On August 1, 2013, Fox Sports extended its contract by two additional years through 2024, due to NASCAR's contract with NBC Sports running through that same time, and acquired the rights to the first 16 races of the NASCAR Cup Series season, as well as the first 14 Xfinity (formerly Nationwide) Series events. As a result, Fox will broadcast the races it already covers, as well as all of the events held in June, which include the events at Pocono and Michigan with coverage ending with the Toyota/Save Mart 350 at Sonoma. Fox had previously held rights to these three races under its initial 2001–06 contract. Under the current deal: *Fox broadcasts ten points races over the air, including the Daytona 500. Fox Sports 1 carries several other events, including the Busch Clash, Bluegreen Vacations Duel, the NASCAR All-Star Race and six points-paying races, plus the first half of the Xfinity Series season (with the exception of the more prestigious races, which instead aired on Fox from 2015 to 2018, when they were moved to FS1). *NBC will broadcast seven races over the air including some races in the NASCAR playoffs, with the other races in this part of the season being aired on NBCSN. NBC also airs the remaining races in the Xfinity Series. Playoff races on NBC are a lead in to NBC Sunday Night Football (after local news and NBC Nightly News). *The Gander Outdoors Truck Series remains exclusively on Fox Sports 1, with selected races airing on Fox. * Starting in 2013, Spanish-language network Fox Deportes airs select NASCAR Cup races either live or delayed.Fox Deportes to broadcast NASCAR Cup races in Spanish - Sporting News, 20 August 2012 ===2013=== From its debut until 2013, Fox initially used a scrolling ticker to display the current running order of drivers and other information (such as intervals and other statistics, shown on an occasionally displayed secondary line), instead of the boxes that were used by previous NASCAR broadcasters. Fox would eventually deploy the banner design across all of its sports properties, while its conventions would be adopted by fellow NASCAR broadcasters, including NBC, TNT, and later ESPN. Beginning with the Party at the Poconos 400 race on June 9, 2013, TNT's NASCAR coverage switched to a 16:9 aspect ratio letterbox format, though it did retain its on-air graphics package that has been in use since 2007. The ticker across the top of the screen also changed, with the lap counter and TNT network logo both being moved to the upper right-hand corner of the screen. The screen on TNT's standard definition 4:3 feed now airs a letterboxed version of the native HD feed to match that of Fox's and ESPN's respective default widescreen SD presentations. NASCAR on TNT was the last of the 3 broadcast partners to switch to a widescreen presentation. NBC became the 4th to switch to letterbox format on SD feeds in 2015. On July 23, 2013, NASCAR announced a nine-year contract with NBC Sports to broadcast the final 20 races of the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series season (from the Coke Zero Sugar 400 at Daytona International Speedway through the Ford EcoBoost 400 at Homestead from 2015 to 2017; in 2018 and 2019, NBC's coverage starts at Chicagoland and ends at Homestead and in 2020 starts in Chicagoland and ends at Phoenix), the final 19 races of the Xfinity Series season, along with coverage of select regional series events and the NASCAR Mexico Series, succeeding both former partners TNT and ESPN. The deal also awarded NBC Sports the rights to provide coverage on digital platforms, rights to Spanish-language coverage for Telemundo and mun2 (now Universo), broadcast rights to the NASCAR Hall of Fame induction ceremony and post-season awards banquets. The deal runs from 2015 to 2024, although the Mexico Series race at Phoenix International Raceway began in 2014. The majority of NBC's NASCAR coverage under the new contract will air on NBCSN, however seven races will be broadcast by the NBC broadcast network; in 2015 and 2016, they were the Coke Zero Sugar 400, the Bojangles' Southern 500 at Darlington, the Chase races at Charlotte and Kansas, and the last three races (Texas, Phoenix and Homestead-Miami) consecutively. NBC Sports took over the portion of the contract previously held by ESPN and Turner Sports. While financial details were not disclosed, NBC reportedly paid 50% more than the $2.7 billion paid by ESPN and Turner combined under the previous contract. Former Turner Sports executive Jeff Behnke serves as vice president of NASCAR programming for NBC Sports. In August 2013, Speed was replaced by Fox Sports 1, and Fuel TV by Fox Sports 2. Camping World Truck Series races remained on Fox Sports 1, while practice/qualifying sessions and regional series races alternated between Fox Sports 1 and 2 depending on scheduling. For North American markets outside of the United States, coverage of some NASCAR events carried by Speed at the time remained on an international version of Speed (now Fox Sports Racing) that operates in the regions. On December 3, 2013, Jeff Burton was confirmed as the first member of the NASCAR on NBC broadcast team. On December 4, 2013, Rick Allen, who previously worked at Fox Sports as an announcer for its Camping World Truck Series coverage, signed a multi-year contract to serve as the lead announcer for NBC's race broadcasts. ===2014=== This season was the final year of broadcasting for both the ESPN family of networks and Turner Sports. ESPN had covered the second half of the Sprint Cup season since 2007 while Turner Sports ended a thirty-one year relationship with NASCAR on TBS and later TNT. For 2015, their portions of the season were divided between Fox Sports and NBC. On January 9, 2014, it was confirmed that Steve Letarte would leave his role as Dale Earnhardt, Jr.'s crew chief at Hendrick Motorsports and join NBC Sports as a color analyst. Behnke explained that the on-air makeup of NBC Sports' broadcasts would have \\"a relevancy that hasn't been seen in a long, long time\\", citing the recent involvements of both Burton and Letarte in NASCAR prior to their move to broadcasting. NBC began to lead into its new contract in February 2014 with the premiere of a nightly news and analysis program, NASCAR America, on NBCSN, and a broadcast of the Toyota 120 from Phoenix International Raceway – the opening event of the 2014 season of the NASCAR Toyota Series, on mun2. For the 2014 season, alongside a new corporate style, Fox replaced the scrolling ticker with a leaderboard- style sidebar occupying the right-side portion of the screen, with one section displaying the top three drivers, and a scrolling section displaying the remainder of the field of drivers. While Fox Sports president Eric Shanks justified the changes, noting that it would allow more of the field to be displayed at once and more frequently than the relatively longer ticker, the leaderboard was criticized by viewers during events leading up to the Daytona 500 (such as the Sprint Unlimited, Daytona 500 qualifying, and the ARCA series Lucas Oil 200) for obstructing too much of the screen. In response to the criticism, Shanks stated that the layout of the leaderboard would be revised in time for the Daytona 500. The vertical leaderboard was reconfigured into a horizontal version with three columns of 3 drivers each, which could be resized into 2 longer columns of three drivers each to display intervals or other statistics (a version that was later used as the main graphic). The Camping World RV Sales 301, on July 13, 2014, at New Hampshire Motor Speedway, marked the end of NASCAR's 32-year run on Turner Sports, dating back to 1983. The network devoted a large segment of its pre-race show to showing clips of signature NASCAR moments to air on Turner Sports, and welcomed NASCAR president Mike Helton to the broadcast booth to talk about the relationship, as Helton had been the president of Atlanta Motor Speedway when Turner Sports showed its first race at AMS, which aired on TBS in 1983. The pre-race was closed out by Ken Squier, a New England native, lap-by-lap announcer for Turner Sports from its start in 1983 through 1998. During NASCAR's 31-year run on Turner Sports, the races aired on TBS (1983–2000) and TNT (2001–2014). On November 16, 2014, the Ford EcoBoost 400 at Homestead-Miami Speedway marked the end of NASCAR's 30-year, two-stint run on ESPN, dating back to 1981 and also, ending an eight-year stint with the network since 2007. Allen Bestwick, who served as lap-by-lap announcer for ESPN's Sprint Cup Series races since 2011, worked his final NASCAR broadcast on network television, marking the end of his role with the network in 29 years covering the sport and remained with ESPN and ABC covering IndyCar races from 2015 to 2018. ===2015=== The season marked the first season of a new television contract. During the season, races were televised in the United States on Fox, Fox Sports 1, NBC, and NBCSN. ESPN and Turner Sports, who televised races from 2007 to 2014, did not seek to renew their contracts with NASCAR following the completion of the 2014 season; this marked the end of a 31-year relationship between NASCAR and Turner's primary stations, TBS and TNT. In addition, it was the first season on the newly rebranded Fox Sports Racing in Canada and the Caribbean. As in their prior arrangement, Fox covered the first half of the season while NBC covered the second half, which includes the Chase for the Sprint Cup. While still dividing the coverage of the Daytona races between the two networks, the nature of the split was changed. Fox retained its exclusive rights to the Daytona 500 while NBC gained exclusive rights to the Coke Zero 400. Under the previous Fox/NBC contract, Fox televised the Daytona 500 in odd numbered years (2001, 2003, 2005) while NBC did so in even numbered years (2002, 2004, 2006). Under the old arrangement, the network that did not air the Daytona 500 would air the now-Coke Zero 400. On February 3, 2015, NBC Sports announced an agreement to air 39 regional series races from the K&N; Pro Series East and West, Whelen Modified Tour and Whelen Southern Modified Tour on NBCSN. The first U.S.-series race under the contract was The Hart to Heart Breast Cancer Foundation 150—the first race of the 2015 NASCAR K&N; Pro Series East season—at New Smyrna Speedway, and was aired on February 19 on NBCSN. From 2015-17, the intro for the revived run of NASCAR on NBC was Bringing Back the Sunshine performed by country music artist Blake Shelton, who is also one of the coaches on NBC's own prime time hit show, The Voice. NBC introduced a new opening for their coverage of NASCAR starting in 2018. The new opening is a cover version of the Tom Petty song Runnin' Down a Dream, done by ZZ Ward. On April 15, 2015, it was announced that Ralph Sheheen and Ray Evernham would be part of the booth of the NBCSN telecasts of the Whelen Modified Tour and Whelen Southern Modified Tour. On June 1, 2015, Brian Vickers announced via Twitter that he would be joining the NBC telecasts of the New Hampshire and Michigan races. On September 1, 2015, it was announced that Ken Squier and Ned Jarrett would commentate a portion of the 2015 Bojangles' Southern 500 along with current NASCAR on NBC commentator Dale Jarrett. Squier was also in the broadcast booth for Sprint Cup Series final practice. This has become a standard tradition at the Southern 500, due to NASCAR designating the race as a throwback weekend where teams bring retro paint schemes to the track. On September 11, 2015, it was announced that Carl Edwards would be in the NBCSN broadcast booth as a guest analyst for the Xfinity race at Richmond alongside Dale Jarrett and Diffey. Jamie McMurray was a guest analyst for the NXS race at Chicagoland. ===2016=== 2016 marks the second year of NASCAR's broadcast deal with Fox and NBC. The first 16 events were broadcast on either Fox or FS1, and the final 20 events were shared between NBC and NBCSN. However, the Cheez-It 355 at Watkins Glen International was aired on USA Network due to NBC's coverage of the 2016 Summer Olympics. In Canada, TSN televised each race, including the qualifying races for the Daytona 500 and exhibition races, under the name NASCAR on TSN. TSN also had coverage of practice and qualifying for each race. In Latin America, except Brazil, all races were broadcast by Fox Sports, on their Fox Sports 3 channel (previously known as SPEED Latin America). In Brazil, most races were broadcast by Fox Sports, on their Fox Sports 2 channel. As previously mentioned, during Summer Olympic years (three during the contract, in 2016, 2020, and 2024), NBC will assign different NBCUniversal channels to air races as a result of scheduling conflicts. For 2016, CNBC (used for English Premier League, IndyCar, and Formula One for NBCSN conflicts) carried Sprint Cup and Xfinity qualifying along with one Xfinity race, and USA Network (used for Premier League conflicts) carried two Xfinity and one Sprint Cup race. In 2020, the Cup Series will take two weeks off to minimize any conflict with the Olympics; the Michigan race will be run on the day of the Games' closing ceremony. ===2017=== On June 10, 2017, the Xfinity Series race at Pocono Raceway was presented by current drivers in the Cup Series, the first time that a national sporting event was covered by currently active athletes. The presenters provided coverage from all three perspectives during the race (Hollywood Hotel studio, lap-by-lap commentary and pit road coverage). The driver commentators were Kevin Harvick (lap-by- lap), Joey Logano, Clint Bowyer (color analysts), Erik Jones, Ryan Blaney, Ricky Stenhouse Jr. (pit road), Danica Patrick and Denny Hamlin (Hollywood Hotel). On July 24, 2017, it was announced that Dale Earnhardt Jr. would join the NASCAR on NBC broadcasting team for the 2018 season, incidentally reuniting with his former crew chief Letarte.Dale Earnhardt Jr to join NBC broadcast booth in 2018 - Business Insider / AP, 24 July 2017 In November 2017, it was announced that Bob Costas would alongside Krista Voda, co-anchor NBC's pre-race coverage leading into the NASCAR Cup Series finale from Homestead. ===2018=== In the 2018 season, Fox reintroduced a vertical leaderboard, although this time it was initially occupied an opaque sidebar spanning the entire left side of the screen. The design was once-again criticized by viewers during events leading up to the Daytona 500, as the opaque sidebar reduced the amount of screen space devoted to race footage to a roughly 4:3 window, the ticker fell within overscan on some televisions, while some camera shots were not correctly framed to suit the new layout. By the Daytona 500, the graphic had been revised to remove the opaque sidebar, and make the leaderboard slightly translucent. On April 28, 2018, the Sparks Energy 300, the Xfinity race at Talladega Superspeedway, was an all-drivers broadcast, the second time that a national sporting event was covered entirely by active athletes, the first being the aforementioned Pocono race. The presenters provided coverage from all three perspectives during the race (Hollywood Hotel studio, lap-by-lap commentary and pit road coverage). The booth team of Harvick, Logano and Bowyer was retained, while Ricky Stenhouse Jr. was moved to the Hollywood Hotel alongside Brad Keselowski, with Darrell Wallace, Jr. replacing Stenhouse as a pit road reporter. The studio was retired following the 2018 season due to the Charlotte studios getting redone in order to host more shows. In 2019, Fox often cut to the Charlotte studio during the race and talked to Jamie McMurray, who was new to the NASCAR on Fox team. NBC's pit reporters for 2018 consisted of Dave Burns, Marty Snider, Kelli Stavast, Parker Kligerman (who replaced Mike Massaro following the 2016 season), and Ralph Sheheen, Burns and Snider were with NBC's original NASCAR pit crew, while Massaro joins from ESPN's NASCAR team and Stavast from the network's sports car coverage. The pre-race show was hosted by former Fox reporter Krista Voda along with former ESPN analyst Dale Jarrett, former TNT analyst Kyle Petty, and Top Gear host Rutledge Wood. ===2019=== In 2019 during Daytona 500 qualifying, Fox introduced a new augmented reality \\"GhostCar\\", allowing for a live visualization of a previous driver's qualifying lap (such as the leader or driver on the bubble) to be overlaid into live footage of another driver's qualifying attempt. NBC had introduced the system in 2018, but only during replays. The GhostCar feature was re-introduced later in the season, when NASCAR ended its multi-car qualifying format in favor of the previous single-car format. On May 25, 2019, the Alsco 300, the Xfinity race at Charlotte Motor Speedway, was an all-drivers broadcast, the third time that a national sporting event was covered entirely by active athletes, the first being the aforementioned Pocono race. The presenters provided coverage from all three perspectives during the race (Hollywood Hotel studio, lap-by-lap commentary and pit road coverage). The booth team of Harvick, Logano and Bowyer was retained, Erik Jones, Ryan Blaney, Darrell Wallace, Jr. (pit road) was also retained, Brad Keselowski, Ricky Stenhouse Jr. and Chad Knaus hosted from the Charlotte studios. In July 2019, it was announced that Danielle Trotta will join NBC Sports’ NASCAR coverage as host of the “Victory Lap” post-race show for select Cup Series races this year. ==ReferencesSee also== *List of Daytona 500 broadcasters *List of Fox NASCAR broadcasters *NASCAR on television in the 1960s **NASCAR on television in the 1970s **NASCAR on television in the 1980s **NASCAR on television in the 1990s **NASCAR on television in the 2000s ==External links== *Awful Announcing **NASCAR on ABC ***ESPN **NASCAR on Fox ***FS1 **NASCAR on NBC ***NBCSN **NASCAR on TNT **NASCAR ratings 2010s Category:Fox Sports original programming Category:NBC Sports Category:NBCSN Category:ESPN Category:ABC Sports Category:Turner Sports Category:Speed (TV network) 2019 Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series Category:2010s in American television ","title":"NASCAR on television in the 2010s"},{"id":"61395387","text":"The Men's Light flyweight competition of the boxing events at the 2019 Pan American Games in Lima, Peru, was held between 27 July and 2 August 2019 at the Miguel Grau Coliseum.

Her family was of Russian and Lithuanian Jewish background, and the original surname had been a form of \\"Cohen.\\" Naomi later credited her brother for first mentioning the subject of anthropology to her on a visit home from Harvard, where he was studying. Naomi earned her AB in anthropology from Radcliffe College in 1961,Radcliffe College Student Directory 1960-61. Cambridge, MA: Radcliffe College. p. 51 with Bea Whiting as her mentor. Quinn worked as a research assistant coding the aggression data from the Six Cultures project.Whiting, B. and J. Whiting (1975). Children of Six Cultures: a psychocultural analysis. Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press. She also participated in a summer fieldwork project in Ecuador with Marvin Harris.

Quinn’s focus during her dissertation research in Ghana shifted away from studying folk taxonomies toward an interest in how people acquired and processed information in natural contexts. In a series of important papers,Quinn, Naomi. (1975) \\"Decision Models of Social Structure.\\" American Ethnologist 2(1):19-46.Quinn, Naomi.

(1978) \\"Do Mfantse Fish Sellers Estimate Probabilities in Their Heads?\\" American Ethnologist 5(2):206-226. she critiqued both microeconomic and descriptive decision models that assumed people made choices by calculating relative probabilities. Instead, her observational and in-depth interview data with Fante fish sellers, boat crew members, and elders who judged local disputes showed that they relied instead on simplifying heuristics and cultural precedents to determine outcomes. These studies also led Quinn to the insight that would shape the rest of her career: knowledge for carrying out cultural tasks is not readily verbalized; therefore, the researcher must develop an eclectic body of methods to reveal underlying assumptions and reasoning processes, something she referred to initially as the “hook or crook” technique (1976:346). In 2005, she would edit an important collection of essays, Finding Culture in Talk,Quinn, Naomi. (2005). Finding culture in talk: a collection of methods. New York: Palgrave Macmillan. which highlighted these distinctive approaches to data collection and analysis. In 1972, Quinn joined the Department of Anthropology at Duke University, where she would remain for the rest of her career. She was promoted to associate professor in 1978 and full professor in 1999,https://www.wiareport.com/2019/07/in-memoriam-naomi-quinn-1939-2019/ serving as chair of Duke's Anthropology Department from 1989 to 1996.Matthews, Holly, Claudia Strauss, Karen Sirota, and Bambi Chapin. 2019. “Naomi R. Quinn.” Anthropology News website, July 29, 2019. Duke recognized her excellence in teaching with its Richard K. Lublin award in 2003. In 1976 she began a study of American marriage, and influenced by schema theory in the cognitive sciences, pioneered cultural models theory in the influential volume, Cultural Models in Language and Thought, co-edited with Dorothy Holland (1987). Later she and Claudia Strauss collaborated on A Cognitive Theory of Cultural Meaning (1997), where they articulated a view of cultural schemas as motivating and potentially enduring but also flexible and adaptive. Quinn was a major figure of feminist scholarship as well as pathbreaking achievements within psychological anthropology and in cultural anthropology more broadly, publishing numerous important studies relevant to childhood socialization and \\"the gendered character of cognition\\",di Leonardo, Micaela, ed.

It is about 19 women who graduated from Skidmore College in 1969, when it was still an all-women college. The film won two awards at film festivals and received positive reception. ==Description== During their time at Skidmore College, the 19 subjects of the film had a year box rather than a year book. Their year box contained photographs that showed what they experienced throughout college. Barton interviewed them when they were near 65 years old. He also interviewed some of the men, including their professors, whom they met while they were in college. The film goes from interviewee to interviewee at random. Interspersed with the interviews are photographs of the women as college students. Executive producer Liz Roman Gallese was a member of that year's graduating class. The film touches on women's issues that are still important in modern times such as in relation to marriage, careers, and whether to have children. The \\"focal point\\" of the film is the women in the present. In 1971, Skidmore College opened up to men as well. ==Release== The film was screened at the Woods Hole Film Festival (Cape Cod), the Women’s International Film and Arts Festival (Miami, Florida), the Queens World Film Festival (New York City), and the New York City Independent Film Festival. It aired on the Maine Public Broadcasting Network (MPBN-TV) on July 5, 2015. On March 29, 2016, the film aired on WNED in Buffalo, N.Y. and WBFO in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. ==Reception== It won the ShortsHD Award for Best Short Documentary at the New York City Independent Film Festival in 2015 and Best Documentary Feature at the Queens World Film Festival in March 2016. At the 2015 Woods Hole Film Festival it was the 1st runner-up in the Best Documentary Feature category. Tim Miller of the Cape Cod Times wrote, \\"This shouldn’t be a big surprise, of course, but, for their era, their pursuit of independent lives was groundbreaking, and Women of ’69, Unboxed makes that point loud and clear. And effectively.\\" In a review for Next Avenue, Linda Bernstein wrote, \\"The freedoms these women fought for — that they had to even fight for things like the right to drink alcohol on campus — is the lesson of the film.\\" ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:2014 films Category:Documentary films about women Category:Skidmore College Category:1969 in film ","title":"Women of '69, Unboxed"},{"id":"61395590","text":"DYVW (1386 AM) is a radio station owned and operated by the Voice of the Word Media Network, the media arm of the Diocese of Borongan.

The game includes eight golf courses and a golf swing method known as TrueSwing, which uses the movement of the computer mouse to simulate a golf swing in real-time as the player makes the shot. Also included is the ReadyPlay feature, allowing golfers in a multiplayer group to play at their own pace without waiting for others to finish their turn. The game was praised for its variety, including its TrueSwing and ReadyPlay features, although its golf commentary was criticized. The game was followed by a sequel, PGA Championship Golf 2000. ==Gameplay== PGA Championship Golf 1999 Edition includes seven real-life courses: Black Diamond Ranch, Coeur d'Alene Resort, Pasatiempo, Pete Dye Golf Club, Prince Course, Royal Birkdale, and Sahalee Country Club. A fictional eighth course, Jocassee Shoals, is also featured. The real courses each start with a short film which serves as an overview of the course. The Course Architect is a feature which allows the player to create custom golf courses, with options that include hills, valleys, trees, and sound effects. PGA Championship Golf 1999 Edition features 12 game modes, including four- ball, match, scramble, and skins. A practice mode is also featured. The game includes professional golfer Tom Lehman and several default golfers as playable characters. Additional golfers can be custom-made by the player, with selectable options such as gender, skin tone, hair, and hats. Computer- controlled golfers can be set to gradually learn from the actual player's golfing and thus become more challenging for the player. The player can choose to let a caddie select the golf clubs, and candies can also track the statistics of the player's shots to gradually learn which clubs work best in certain scenarios. Rather than using an aim mechanism, the player must rotate the golfer's position to aim for the hole. The game includes a traditional three-click golf swing method, as well as the TrueSwing method, which uses the movement of the computer mouse to simulate the golf swing in real-time as the player makes the shot. On the green, the player can use a ground-based grid to aid with putting. The player can also make use of mulligans and gimmes, and can select post-shot animations, such as falling to the ground in frustration at a poor shot. The game features golf commentary by Mark Lye and Grant Boone. Various camera angles are featured as well. Multiplayer options include modem and LAN, and WON.net was also an option at the time of release. The ReadyPlay feature allows each golfer in a multiplayer group to play at their own pace, rather than waiting for each golfer to finish their turn. ==Development and release== In July 1998, Sierra Sports announced an agreement with PGA Interactive to create PGA Championship Golf 1999 Edition, scheduled for release that October. The game was developed by Headgate Studios. The game's director was Vance Cook, who also served as a designer and software engineer. Cook, who founded Headgate Studios, had previously worked on the Links golf games and Sierra's Front Page Sports: Golf. To replicate the courses, Cook and his team would survey each real course, then they would fly an airplane 1,000 to 2,000 feet above the course and take aerial photographs. The survey data and photographs were then put through the process of photogrammetry. Following that, a photographer would visit the courses to take pictures of trees, bushes, ground textures, and the clubhouses. The pictures were then taken to Headgate's office in Salt Lake City, Utah, where the courses were then created. Each course took three to four months to complete, with a team of three or four people. The Jocassee Shoals course was created using the Course Architect. The golfers consist of 400 animated motions and are made of up to 20,000 polygons. The game's TrueSwing was previously featured in Front Page Sports: Golf, and was enhanced for PGA Championship Golf 1999 Edition. On May 20, 1999, Sierra Sports announced the completion of the game. In North America, copies of PGA Championship Golf 1999 Edition began shipping in late May 1999, and were expected to be on sale by June 1. The game was released for Microsoft Windows. The Sierra Sports Golf Association, a sports league created by WON.net, hosted various online golf events for players of the game. In addition, players using the Course Architect would post their custom-made courses online to share with others. As of July 1999, more than 35 custom courses had been posted on WON.net. By September 1999, the game had been released in the United Kingdom. By August 2000, the game had been re-released in the U.K as part of the Sierra Originals budget label. ==Reception== Some critics considered the gameplay inferior to the Links, Jack Nicklaus, and PGA Tour series, although Ewan Macdonald of Eurogamer preferred it over the Links series and considered it one of the better golf games available. Mike Snider of USA Today called the game \\"intriguing, but not of championship stature.\\" William Abner of Computer Games Strategy Plus called the game \\"an enigma,\\" writing, \\"It has the best swing method in the industry, a powerful course designer, addictive gameplay, and yet it feels unfinished.\\" Brett Todd of Computer Gaming World considered it a forgettable game. The graphics received some praise, although they were also considered inferior to the Links and Jack Nicklaus games. Macdonald called the game a \\"strange hybrid\\" of 3D and 2D graphics. Gordon Goble of Gamecenter considered the graphics realistic but stated that they had a \\"dull, almost drab look\\" that was lacking in color. Todd considered the courses to be \\"nicely drawn, but plain,\\" and criticized their similarities to each other, as did Paul Rosano of Hartford Courant. Martin Korda of PC Zone called the graphics \\"smooth, if not spectacular, although it's a shame that the crowd are so static; they can also stand right in front of your golfer when he takes a shot, which is a little sloppy.\\" Chris Buxton of PC Gamer (U.K.) criticized the stagnant and \\"awful-looking\\" spectators, while Abner wrote that they \\"are never watching the action. Instead, they are staring off into oblivion, apparently trying to get a good look at the blimp overhead.\\" Stephen Butts of IGN stated that although the spectators are rendered in 2D, they \\"look very, very real.\\" Todd criticized the cartoonish golfers, calling them \\"little more than animated mannequins, devoid of any facial features.\\" Rosano stated that the golfers were \\"just about the goofiest around,\\" calling them \\"awkward and cartoonish.\\" Butts noted that most of the golfers' facial designs looked alike and that \\"the women are a little weird looking.\\" Snider wrote that the Tom Lehman character \\"falls short of his likeness\\". Buxton noted an issue in which \\"the player animation stutters, especially when there's more than one golfer on screen.\\" Goble noted that golfers were \\"capable of warping from one location to another--a phenomenon that may save time but looks totally bizarre.\\" Marc Saltzman of GamePro criticized the game's \\"exaggerated\\" post-shot player animations, stating that in one instance, the golfer \\"looked like he was having a heart attack\\". Stephen Poole of GameSpot wrote \\"what little the game lacks in visual appeal it more than makes up for with an excellent interface, lifelike golfer animations, and very good ball physics.\\" Other critics were mixed on whether the game physics were superior to the Links series. Some praised the sound, although the commentary was generally criticized. Todd referred to the commentators as \\"Nostradamus and Jeane Dixon\\" because of their \\"uncanny knack for predicting where your ball is going to drop.\\" Goble wrote that \\"much of the shot-making drama is negated by announcers who broadcast your ball's final resting spot almost immediately after you've swung your club.\\" Rob Smolka of PC Gamer (U.S.) criticized the commentators for being \\"extremely repetitive\\" and \\"omniscient\\", and stated that their ability to essentially predict where the ball will land \\"really removes any drama from those close-call shots.\\" Smolka further stated that the commentators \\"become babbling idiots around the green, congratulating you on poorly played chips and pitches, and at times misleading you on which direction your ball will break on putts.\\" Abner disliked the commentary and its inaccuracies, writing that the commentators \\"have a peculiar notion as to what constitutes a good shot.\\" Abner also criticized the commentators' \\"enhanced future seeing ability,\\" which \\"kills any tension that watching your shot skirt with trouble can provide.\\" House considered the commentary to be \\"without doubt, the weakest and most annoying part of the game,\\" writing that the commentators often repeated each other's comments and that they had limited vocabulary which quickly became tedious. PC Accelerator also stated that the commentary quickly becomes annoying. Macdonald called the commentary \\"commendable\\", accurate, and often informative, while Buxton wrote that the commentators occasionally gave poor advice. Chris Capell of Sports Gaming Network criticized the commentary for being repetitive and incorrect, but otherwise stated that it was of \\"high quality, and very authentic.\\" Saltzman wrote that the commentary and crowd reaction \\"is often inconsistent with what's happening on the course,\\" noting one instance in which the crowd \\"cheered wildly when I hit the ball into the trees.\\" Goble stated that although the spectators' \\"cheers and groans sound very authentic, it is very strange that you don't hear a peep until your ball has come to a full stop.\\" Critics praised the ReadyPlay feature. House called it an \\"enormous innovation\\" and wrote, \\"No longer do you have to sit idly by while the other three golfers in your foursome hack away.\\" Abner called it \\"both a blessing and a curse,\\" stating that it speeds up the gameplay but that other players occasionally \\"stand in the way of a shot making it impossible to see where you are hitting; this is especially frustrating when on the green.\\" Smolka also acknowledged that it speeds up the gameplay, but that it \\"can be a bit disconcerting - especially when you're the first to reach the green and, while you're lining up your putt, a stray golf ball comes flying right at you!\\" The game's variety was praised, as well as the TrueSwing method. Abner called the TrueSwing \\"the biggest selling point\\", while stating that the three-click method was \\"far too easy to use and simply feels tacked on.\\" Praising the TrueSwing method, House wrote that the game \\"achieves what I had begun to think of as the unattainable Holy Grail of golf simulation\\". Rosano wrote, \\"The feel of the mouse swing is truly incredible, way ahead of the competition.\\" Capell stated that the TrueSwing was \\"a surprisingly natural and easy method to pick up, and has depth you wouldn't believe.\\" The Course Architect was considered easy to use, although Butts considered its interface to be overwhelmed by options. While some critics praised the course designer, others expressed disappointment that it does not allow the creation of holes in which the ball has to travel across water. Others noted that the program would freeze or crash. In his September 1999 review of the game, Rosano wrote that following the recent release of a patch, \\"the architect has repeatedly crashed at the beginning of a new session, something Sierra must address immediately.\\" In addition, some critics noted issues in which the game would crash or freeze when playing on WON.net, although Goble noted that the website's support of the game \\"is still in its early stages and should improve in the future.\\" The issue was ongoing as of November 1999. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Official website (archived) Category:1999 video games Category:Golf video games Category:Windows games Category:Windows-only games Category:Sierra Entertainment games Category:Video games developed in the United States ","title":"PGA Championship Golf 1999 Edition"},{"id":"61395617","text":"Engle Lake, originally named Laguna del Muerto (Lake of the Deadman) by the Spanish, is a seasonal lake in the Jornada del Muerto region in Sierra County, New Mexico.

It was released on July 28, 2017 for Microsoft Windows, June 25, 2019 for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, and February 15, 2019 for Nintendo Switch. A simplified version for mobile platforms was released in June 2018. The game is the third in the Car Mechanic Simulator series, following Car Mechanic Simulator 2014 and Car Mechanic Simulator 2015. ==Gameplay== The game is played from a first- person perspective, with the player able to walk freely around the shop, showrooms and barns where damaged cars can be purchased to be repaired and/or resold. The player has access to a wide variety of tools, most of which are unlocked by completing jobs and earning experience. Over the course of the game, the player expands their workshop, allowing them to complete increasingly complex repair work as well as the restoration of classic cars. Gameplay involves examining the various components of the vehicles engine, suspension and chassis, identifying damaged components and replacing them. This can be done by purchasing a replacement component or, at higher levels, repairing the existing one. Engines are rendered in a great deal of detail, requiring the player to remove parts in a realistic manner in order to access the relevant component. In order to complete the required task, the player must use realistic hardware like a tire balancer, spring puller, detailing kit and engine mount. Further sections of the workroom become unlocked over the course of the game. These include a test track which can identify issues with a car's brakes and suspension and a paintshop which is used to paint and customize the car's body. ==Reception== Car Mechanic Simulator received mixed to positive reviews, holding a 6.8 on Metacritic. Rock Paper Shotgun called the game \\"singularly captivating and cathartic\\" while criticising a large number of bugs present in the initial release, as well as a number of the design decisions. A followup review after patching was complete indicated that the technical issues had been resolved. The Nintendo Switch version of the game was heavily criticised by Nintendo Enthusiast, who criticised it for being a port of the mobile release, calling it \\"a really sad attempt at making a quick buck off of unsuspecting buyers.\\" ==Downloadable content== A variety of downloadable content is available for Car Mechanic Simulator 2018, the majority of which expands the range of cars available. Unlike the cars in the base game, which are fictional analogues for real cars, DLC cars are officially licensed replicas.

They originally debuted as a duo with Naru and Park Sol in June 2012 with the digital single \\"Sounds of the Universe\\" from their self-titled album The Solutions. Kwon Oh-kyung and Park Han-sol joined the band for their second album Movements in 2014, which included the work of Grammy award-winning recording engineer and producer Jimmy Douglass. The group takes influences from 90s British pop, American alternative, and contemporary Japanese pop music, with most of their songs written in English despite having no native English speaking members. They have toured Asia, Europe and the U.S. and are popular in the indie scene in Hongdae, Seoul. ==History2012–2018:The Solutions, Movements, formation and touring=== The band was formed in 2012 by frontman and lead singer Park Sol and guitarist Naru. Both had previously been solo performers. Naru, a music producer and singer songwriter, had released two modern rock genre solo albums, Jaga Dangchak in 2008 and Yet in 2010. Park Sol was an already well-known indie musician, with a 2010 album The Song is You, and was a singer songwriter for the 2011 music competition show Superstar K 3. Park Sol has described Naru, who usually arranges the music, as the leader between the two. They started writing and performing most of their songs in the English language, as the lyrics seemed to work better than Korean lyrics; but they have questioned their abilities to sing well in English. Naru spent five years as a child in America and later studied English in Korea, and Park Sol learned it while traveling abroad for a year when he was twenty. Naru said he started playing guitar in his teens and writing songs at twenty, and says the two of them work hard at music, as they had a later start than some musicians. The band toured Asian countries, Europe and the U.S., and performed solo and at indie festivals in Hongdae. In 2015, they played at the fifth Seoulsonic annual concert which introduced South Korean musicians to U.S. audiences at the SXSW music festival. They headlined the 2017 Pentaport Rock Festival along with other South Korean and foreign acts, including rock bands Bastille and 5 Seconds of Summer, and have performed at Japan's Summer Sonic Festival and Spain's Primavera Sound. Their first album The Solutions was released by the original duo, Naru and Park Sol in 2012, and followed by a second album, Movements, with all four members in 2014. They created the song \\"All That You Want\\" for the music project SM Station's 2017-2018 Season 2. ===2019–present:Signature=== They released their third studio album Signature on July 29, 2019, which includes the title track \\"In My City\\". They also released an EP titled \\"Load\\" featuring the title track \\"Dance With Me\\" on June 2, 2020. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FVeS06AbtE ==Musical process, style, and influences== Naru described their sound in 2014 to Hilde Heyvaert, a Never Was magazine writer, while playing in Liège, Belgium, \\"We experiment mixing our favorite sounds from the 80s, 90s and contemporary music. Using both guitars and synthesisers, which I like both. We are experimenting with mixing them, without making it sound complex. We want people to be able to just listen, not hearing all that complexity. It’s pretty difficult to do that.\\" Heyvaert's description said, \\"this band was unintentionally playing music that could happily be a soundtrack to a rock-and-roll-loving dieselpunk lifestyle.\\" In an interview with NoHo Arts District, Los Angeles reporter Caroline McElroy, for NoHoArtsDistrict.com, in October 2016, while playing at the Hotel Café, they detailed the band's songwriting process, which varies, sometimes starting with one member's contributing a completed song, and at others, with the group creating a song \\"organically\\" together, with Naru arranging the final product. They said they are influenced by \\"80s, new wave and alternative music to EDM acts such as Radiohead and Smashing Pumpkins\\". The band published a book in 2015, with the encouragement of an interested publishing company, Do it, Just Do It, about each members' musical journey. It includes Park Sol's story of listening to Nirvana in middle school and Naru's working at a factory job to save to buy a guitar. == Members == * Kwon Oh-kyung (관오경) – bass * Naru (나루), birthname: Kang Kyung-tae (강경태) – guitar, backing vocals * Park Sol (박솔) – lead vocals * Park Han-sol (박한솔) – drums == Discography  Albums === { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Title ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Album details ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"1\\"  Peak chart positions - !style=width:3em;font-size:90%KOR - ! scope=\\"row\\" THE SOLUTIONS  *Released: August 30, 2012 *Formats: CD, digital download  - - ! scope=\\"row\\" MOVEMENTS  *Released: May 16, 2014 *Formats: CD, digital download  - - ! scope=\\"row\\" SIGNATURE  *Released: July 29, 2019 *Formats: CD, digital download  - } === EPs === { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Title ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Album details ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"1\\"  Peak chart positions - !style=width:3em;font-size:90%KOR - ! scope=\\"row\\" NO PROBLEM!  *Released: June 8, 2015 *Formats: CD, digital download  - - ! scope=\\"row\\" THUMBS UP  *Released: September 8, 2017 *Formats: CD, digital download  - } === Singles === { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - ! rowspan=\\"2\\"  Title ! rowspan=\\"2\\"  Year ! colspan=\\"2\\"  Peak chart positions ! rowspan=\\"2\\"  Album - ! style=\\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\\" KOR ! style=\\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\\" US World - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Sounds of the Universe\\"  rowspan=\\"2\\"  2012  —  —  - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Talk, Dance, Party for Love\\"  —  —  - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"STAGE\\"  2015  —  —  - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Ticket To The Moon\\"  2016  —  —  - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"All That You Want\\" (당신이 원하는 모든 것)  rowspan=\\"2\\"  2017  —  19  SM Station Season 2 - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Love Again\\"  —  —  - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Love Again (Japanese Ver.)\\"  rowspan=\\"2\\"  2018  —  —  - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"MOOD FOR LOVE\\"  —  —  - } === Collaborations === { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" !

It is currently controlled by the Claro Group. The tabloid has been using the orange paper that distinguishes economic media in the world since its June 19, 1989 edition, such as the Financial Times. Its main competence is the \\"Economy and Business\\" body of El Mercurio, Pulso of the Copesa and Estrategia. ==History== The idea of creating a newspaper specialized in finance arises in mid-1988 from the journalist René Jáuregui, then in Economy and Business of El Mercurio, who in a conversation at the house of Osvaldo Cifuentes, raises the idea to Enrique Contreras and Roberto Meza .1 She consisted of launching a page distributed in the financial district of Santiago, something similar to how Ámbito Financiero had begun in Argentina, but in the days Mario Vackflores, partner of Meza in a communications agency, stated that it should be a daily. Jáuregui invited the businessman Pedro Lizana to participate in the business who became the first president of Ediciones Financieras S.A.Meza Antognoni, Roberto (2012).

The shares were subscribed by six partners: Pedro Lizana Greve, President; Mario Vackflores, General Manager; Roberto Meza Antognoni, Director; René Jáuregui, General Editor; Osvaldo Cifuentes Visconti and Enrique Contreras, EditorsMeza Antognoni, Roberto (2012). History of El Diario Financiero de Chile. Santiago de Chile: Radio University of Chile Editions. . The registered name of the new newspaper was El Diario Financiero, but by opposition presented by Víctor Manuel Ojeda Méndez, director of the newspaper Estrategia and the magazine Gestión, before the Ministry of Economy, the generic newspaper El Diario had to be circulated, adding three concepts Under it: Finance, Economy, Development1. On April 4, 2003, El Diario is officially called Diario Financiero after reaching an agreement to purchase the brand. In 1996, he joined Ricardo Claro as partner in Ediciones Chiloé, which is the controller of Ediciones Financieras, the Spanish group RECOLETOS, a subsidiary at the time of Pearson (editor of the Financial Times), owner of the Spanish newspaper Expansión. This group had a delegated director (a kind of newspaper boss, since Chilean legislation does not allow a foreigner to be a newspaper director), which fell to Carmelo Calvo. The arrival of the Spanish group allowed a boost in the editorial part by having key agreements such as translation and exclusive rights over articles from the Financial Times, BusinessWeek, Economist Intelligence Unit and Expansion itself. The Spanish expedition continued until August 2005, when Recoletos sells its participation in Diario Financiero to Cristalerias Chile, owned by the Claro group, for three million dollars (2.5 million euros), according to the Spanish group that quoted at this point in the Madrid Stock Exchange. With this, the Claro group increased its participation in Ediciones Financieras SA, controller of Diario Financiero, to 73.31%, leaving the rest of the property in the hands of well- known Chilean entrepreneurs such as Roberto Izquierdo Menéndez (Alimar companies), Andrés Navarro ( Sonda) and José Luis Del Río (Derco / Falabella) http://www.cristalchile.cl/memoria-cristalerias-de-chile-2016/.

Widely acclaimed, he is considered as one of the most influential artists in Ethiopia. Rophnan entered into the mainstream recognition after his ground-breaking debut album Netsebraq (Reflection), which introduced a completely new style of Ethiopian music and pioneered electronic music in Ethiopia. == Early life == Rophnan was born and raised in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. He is the ninth child out of 10 children in his family. His father named him Rophnan after having a revelation during deep prayer, the name Rophnan is not in Amharic nor does it have roots in any other language. When he was 10 years old, Rophnan started recording tapes in his classroom, singing and improvising drums to entertain his friends. His music style uniquely merges traditional Ethiopian instruments with contemporary electronic music. == Career 2006–2014: Early years=== At 16 years old, Rophnan released his first mixtape which introduced him to Ethiopian club scene. The mixtape became an instant success, and in a market lacking local producers, DJs were playing it all across the country. The Mahmoud Ahmed's remix of the legendary song \\"Bemin Sebeb Litash\\" gained the most attention. The remix showcased Rophnan's ability to translate traditional melodies and rhymes into powerful electronic anthems. Rophnan continued to DJ in clubs and venues in Addis Ababa while creating and developing his own sound, a fusion of Ethiopian cultural elements, unique vocals and cutting edge music. ===2014–2018: Career beginnings=== In the following years, Rophnan slowly established himself as the country's biggest DJ while introducing the country to electronic music. He had residencies in all the top clubs in Addis Ababa, often playing 3 shows a night. Rophnan kept his own music unreleased and made sure that the only place one could hear his tracks would be when he played them himself. One of Rophnan signature tracks, \\"Get To Work\\", a Gurage- based beat, was released this way and was played exclusively as part of Rophnan's own DJ sets, which made the song famous within Addis Ababa youth without having to release it. Rophnan played a pivotal role in the rise of electronic music and DJ culture in Ethiopia. He continued to headline more and more events packing the biggest venues. ===2018–2019: Netsebraq=== In May 2018, Rophnan released his debut album, named Netsebraq, meaning \\"reflection\\". This was the first electronic music LP to ever be released in Ethiopia. The album was released independently by RAEY Records. A shorter version of the album, named Netsebraq E.P. was released by the Ghanaian label Akwaaba Music. Netsebraq was deeply rooted in raw traditional Ethiopian music but also mixing futuristic aesthetics into the powerful songs which reflected Rophnan's generation and artistic vision. Introducing a new musical message, the album took a little while to be absorbed by the Ethiopian market, but in just a few months, the album's reach expanded from clubs, to street corners, to radio stations and finally became the most played album of the year. Respectively, Rophnan became one of the most celebrated artists in the country. The release of the album coincided with a governmental change which brought a new spirit and energy to the youth of Ethiopia, and Netsebraq became the soundtrack of those winds of change. Soon after the album release Rophnan has performed live in the popular Ehud Be EBS TV show where he delivered a 10-minute set of live music, becoming the first artist ever to not lip-sync on the show. The video went viral and was viewed by millions. The album won Rophnan three 2018's Leza Awards including Album of The Year, becoming a ground breaking release for an emerging genre.https://www.thereporterethiopia.com/article/rophnan-shines- leza-awards-night In his acceptance speech, staying true to the generation who brought him to this point in his career, Rophnan said: 2018 also saw world- famous music group Major Lazer feature the track \\"Get To Work\\" on their \\"Africa To The World\\" compilation, highlighting Rophnan's place in the forefront of contemporary African music.http://www.akwaabamusic.com/en/countries/ethiopia/rophnan-my-generation- concert-major-lazer-mixtape/ At the end of the 2018 Rophnan participated in Coke Studio Africa in Nairobi, where a collaboration with Zambian Rapper Chef 187 resulted in an original track named \\"All The Way\\".http://www.tadias.com/01/16/2019/spotlight-ethiopias-dj-rophnan-nuri-at- coke-studio-africa-2019/ The powerful track and the use of ancient African instrumentation, together with cutting-edge sound design, drew positive feedback across the continent and became one of the season musical highlights. Rophnan gained sweeping amount of fans (stylized as Phans) by being a representative of a new generation's creative force in Ethiopia. This status manifested itself in an unprecedented scope of digital following, memes, fan art and social trends. The \\"Rophside\\", a side view picture which imitated the album art and Rophnan's favorite picture pose, itself derived from the long time tradition of Ethiopian emperors and rulers posing in profile, became an internet phenomenon and trending hashtag. At the first half of 2019 Rophnan went on the My Generation national tour, packing up stadiums across the country with his \\"Phans\\". The opening show of the tour broke the attendance record for Ghion, with massive crowds showing up, thousands beyond the venue capacity, resulting in commotion and police brutality.https://www.thereporterethiopia.com/article/commotion-and-injuries- taint-anticipated-concert The tour was the first to sell tickets via electronic means. In July 2019, Rophnan was featured on Forbes Africa's 30 under 30 list in the Creative Category, naming Rophnan as one of the continent biggest influencers that year. Rophnan is the first Ethiopian musician to be featured on the list. ===Aspiration === In the original inlay of the album, a single line was highlighted - \\"I Believe In My Generation\\". This line has caught the attention of many because of its meaningful message. A generation of innovation, creativity, technology faith and ideas, has accepted Rophnan as one of its key ambassadors. Since then Rophnan has been doing countless MindSet programs at universities, schools and public events, inspiring the youth, sharing ideas and thoughts thorough discussions with his generation. ==Discography== ;Studio albums *Netsebraq (2018, RAEY Records) *Netsebraq E.P (2018, Akwaaba Music) ==ReferencesExternal links== * *Story on The Reporter Category:Living people Category:Ethiopian DJs Category:1990 births ","title":"Rophnan"},{"id":"61396132","text":"Mexico–Saint Lucia relations refers to the diplomatic relations between the United Mexican States and Saint Lucia.

She was a Grade I winner at ages two, three and four, and never finished out of the money. She was named the American Champion Three-Year-Old Filly of 1994 after winning the Alabama, Gazelle and Beldame Stakes, plus finishing second in the Breeders' Cup Distaff. Her four-year-old campaign was equally noteworthy, with wins in the Apple Blossom, Hempstead (now the Ogden Phipps), Go for Wand and John A. Morris (now the Personal Ensign). She was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 2018. ==Background== Heavenly Prize was bred in Kentucky by Ogden Phipps, for whom she raced as a homebred. Over a lifetime involved in the sport, Phipps had owned and bred multiple champions including Buckpasser, Easy Goer and Personal Ensign, though he somewhat notoriously lost a coin flip that decided the ownership of Secretariat. Heavenly Prize was sired by Seeking the Gold, another major stakes winner for the Phipps stable known for his gameness and consistency. Heavenly Prize's dam was the unraced mare Oh What a Dance, a full sister to Breeders' Cup Sprint winner Dancing Spree. Heavenly Prize's second dam, Blitey, became a “blue hen” for the Phipps family – Blitey herself produced four stakes winners, and her female-line descendants have accounted for a further 25 stakes winners. She was trained by Claude \\"Shug\\" McGaughey. For her first eight races, her jockey was Mike Smith. Pat Day rode her in her final ten starts. ==Racing career== Heavenly Prize made three starts at age two, winning twice. She won her first start on September 15, 1993 – a maiden special weight race at Belmont Park – by lengths. McGaughey had another potential star filly in his stable at the time, Inside Information, who won a different maiden race on the same day. Heavenly Prize won in a more dominating fashion, so McGaughey decided to enter her in the Frizette Stakes on October 16, while Inside Information focused on shorter races. The two fillies, both of whom were eventually inducted into the Hall of Fame, did not meet on the racetrack until the end of their four-year-old campaign. In the Frizette, Heavenly Prize \\"romped\\" to a seven-length victory. She went off as the favorite in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies, but finished third behind Phone Chatter. She made her first start as a three-year-old on March 12, 1994, finishing second in the What a Summer Stakes. After some time off to recover from a virus, she finished second in the Prioress Stakes on June 18 and third in the Test Stakes on July 23. She then turned in one of her best performances in the Alabama Stakes at Saratoga on August 13 by beating heavy favorite Lakeway by seven lengths. She followed up by winning the Gazelle Stakes by lengths despite being trapped behind three horses as they entered the stretch. After jockey Mike Smith moved her to the outside, \\"she dropped her head and just kept going.\\" She completed the miles in a time of 1:47, tied for the second-fastest running in the history of the race. Mike E. Smith then gave up the mount on Heavenly Prize to ride the Hall of Fame champion Sky Beauty. On October 8, Heavenly Prize scored her third consecutive Grade I win in the Beldame Stakes by 6 lengths. With only three rivals in a weight-for-age race, she would have been such a prohibitive favorite that the race was run as an exhibition: no betting was allowed. She finished the year with a second-place finish in the Breeders' Cup Distaff with Pat Day in the saddle, coming from off of the slow pace and coming up a neck short to longshot One Dreamer. Despite that loss, she was named the American Champion Three-Year-Old Filly. At age four, she started seven times and won four (all Grade I), and was second in the other three. She started her campaign with a second place finish to Halo America in the Oaklawn Breeders' Cup Handicap on April 2. She then reeled off four straight Grade I wins. In the Apple Blossom on April 21, she defeated Halo America and future Hall of Famer Paseana. Returning to Belmont Park for the Hempstead Handicap on June 18, she defeated yet another future Hall of Famer, Sky Beauty. Shipping next to Saratoga, she won the Go For Wand on July 23 by launching a move on the far turn that took her from lengths behind to the lead within a furlong. She continued to draw away \\"effortlessly, relentlessly\\" to win by 11 lengths. On August 20, she followed up by winning the John A. Morris Handicap by lengths despite carrying 127 pounds – from 13 to 20 pounds more than any of her rivals. She finished the year by finishing second in the Beldame to Serena's Song and second in the Distaff to stablemate Inside Information. Heavenly Prize made one start at age five, taking on male horses in the Donn Handicap. She finished third behind Cigar, who recorded his thirteenth win in a row. ==Retirement== Heavenly Prize was retired to broodmare duty in 1996. She produced eight foals, seven of which were winners. Her best foal was Good Reward, who won multiple Grade I races on the turf. Another foal, Pure Prize, was a Grade II winner and successful sire. Her daughter Just Reward became a Grade I producer. Heavenly Prize died in 2013 at Claiborne Farm in Kentucky. She was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 2018. McGaughey commented that he most proud by her consistency. \\"It was fun to be able to watch her draw off the way she did,\\" he said, \\"and I'm just proud that she was able to do that at 2, 3, and 4.\\" ==PedigreeReferences== Category:1991 racehorse births Category:2013 racehorse deaths Category:Racehorses bred in Kentucky Category:Racehorses trained in the United States Category:Eclipse Award winners Category:United States Thoroughbred Racing Hall of Fame inductees Category:Thoroughbred family 20-b ","title":"Heavenly Prize"},{"id":"61396168","text":"Sarah Elizabeth Medland is Professor and Psychiatric Genetics Group Leader at the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute in Herston, Brisbane, Australia.

A third and final locomotive was ordered and arrived in 1873, these locomotives were withdrawn between 1893 and 1924 from the SAR after many years of hard service. ==History== The railway line from Roseworthy to Forresters (now known as Tarlee), was opened of rail traffic on the 5th of July 1896. The line was originally designed and intended for horse traction and was laid with light 40 pound rail. The idea of horsepower was later discarded and eventually the first two locomotives imported from the Robert Stephenson and Company arrived. These first lot of two locomotives were designated the \\"A Class\\" and were put to work on the Roseworthy to Forresters line. The A class were a first for the South Australian Railways, being the first Broad Gauge locomotives to be fitted with outside cylinders. Though not long after these new locomotives arrived they were found to be quite rigid in their wheelbase and too heavy for the light track. With the arrival of the new F class locomotives in September 1869 the A class had their place taken on this stretch of line. Following the A class locomotives being moved from the Roseworthy to Forresters railway line, they were then placed in service on the Port line. On the Port line these locomotives proved to be a much more valuable asset, so much so that a third locomotive was ordered from Robert Stephenson and Company and arrived in 1873. Over their career these three engines were allocated to suburban passenger and goods services around the South Australian Railways network.

One of the three locomotives was stationed for a period of years at Strathalbyn and was in service to work from Strathalbyn to Milang.

The discovery of the specimens was identified as deposited around fifteen million years ago, revising the earliest record of this peramelemorphian lineage from those of species that existed around ten million years later. == Taxonomy == A fossil species assigned to a new genus, Liyamayi, in a description by researchers at the Riversleigh fossil area, K. J. Travouillon, S. J. Hand , M. Archer and K. H. Black, who identified distinctions in the dentition from other named genera, for a new species of Riversleigh fauna was published in 2014, the authors proposing the specific epithet for Robert Day in gratitude for support toward the research project. The gender of the genus name Liyamayi is stated to be masculine, and combines two terms from the Waanyi language, spoken by peoples of the Riversleigh region, liya and mayi, in reference to the \\"round tooth\\" that distinguishes the genus. == Description == A genus known by a single species, Liyamayi dayi is recognised as an early representative of a thylacomyid lineage that is separated from the Chaeropodidae, a family represented by the modern pig-footed bandicoots Chaeropus , and Peramelidae family of extant bandicooots. The estimates of body mass are from around 650 grams to less than one kilogram. The holotype and only known specimen is a section of the animal's right maxillary with remaining evidence of intact molars M1–M3 and alveoli of the fourth molar. == Distribution and habitat == The distribution of Liyamayi dayi is restricted to Riversleigh, an area rich in series of well preserved fossil mammals. The only known location of specimens is Rick's Sausage Site at Riversleigh, a poorly studied site which is probably middle Miocene, Riversleigh Faunal Zone C approximately 15 mya, at that time part of the wet rainforest that dominated the Riversleigh area. The fauna discovered at the same site support the evidence of a local wet rainforest environment. Finding evidence of the lineage, known from other sites and thought to have diversified in other regions, implies they were establishing themselves in the region as the local ecology responded to a drier climate. == References == Category:Riversleigh fauna Category:Peramelemorphs Category:Species described in 2014 Category:Prehistoric animal genera Category:Fossil taxa described in 2014 ","title":"Liyamayi"},{"id":"61396292","text":"The South Australian Railways C Class Locomotives were built by the Robert Stephenson and Company for the South Australian Railways in 1856. The first locomotive numbered 5 was in service by November 1856, the second locomotive numbered 6 was in service by January 1857. They spent many years with the South Australian Railways and were both rebuilt over the years. They were both withdrawn from service after having a number of years on their service record with No. 5 being withdrawn after 50 years worth of service for the SAR. No. 6 lasted well into Commissioner Webbs era, after being withdrawn in 1926 with almost 70 years of service for the SAR. ==History== Since the South Australian Railways had the new B class tank engines built to run on the new railway line to Gawler, two more locomotives were purchased to also run this service on the lightly laid line. These locomotives were designated the \\"C class\\" and their range was increased to include stops at Roseworthy and Kapunda due to the opening of the new line extension on the 13th of August 1860. During the construction of the Tarlee line extension these new locomotives were utilised during the works. In 1884 & 1885 both locomotives were rebuilt and put back into traffic, the rebuild included new cabs which were complete with front and side circular windows. The C class worked on the northern lines until they were superseded by more powerful locomotives. No. 5 was condemned in 1906 after a 50 years stint in the SAR, and No. 6 continued to work on the suburban system and performed shunting duties at Mile End and Port Adelaide. No. 6 ended its career after an almost 70-year stint for the SAR and was condemned in 1926, which was right into Commissioner Webb's Era. ==References== C Category:Broad gauge locomotives in Australia Category:Robert Stephenson and Company locomotives ","title":"South Australian Railways C class"},{"id":"61396312","text":"Op med hodet!

Established under the 1938 Metis Population Betterment Act as a relief measure for the province's impoverished Métis people, the heavily timbered Marlboro settlement was found to contain no land suitable for agricultural purposes. By 1941, representatives of the Métis withdrew their request to form a settlement in the area. ==History== The Great Depression saw much deprivation among the nomadic Métis population of Alberta, estimated at about 11,000 in 1936. A royal commission was formed to investigate the living conditions of Alberta's \\"half-breeds\\" (as the Métis were known), who was then squatting on road allowances with no ready sources of cash income, or trapping in remote areas without access to education or health services. Métis children in urban areas were driven away from public schools by the ridicule and humiliation of white pupils, with an estimated 80% of the provincial Métis population receiving no education whatsoever. This Ewing Commission saw agriculture, particularly stock-raising, as the means by which the Métis could be made into \\"self- supporting citizens\\". Farm colonies, in which the Métis themselves would provide most of the physical labor, would be a suitably inexpensive relief scheme for the cash-strapped Alberta government to implement. Following these recommendations, the 1938 Metis Population Betterment Act enabled unoccupied Crown land to be set aside for the creation of new Métis settlements. Eleven were originally created by Order-in-Council through 1938 and 1939 – Wolf Lake, Utikuma Lake (now Gift Lake), Cold Lake, Marlboro, Keg River (now Paddle Prairie), Big Prairie (now Peavine), Touchwood, Goodfish Lake (now Kikino), Elizabeth, Fishing Lake, and East Prairie. Caslan (now Buffalo Lake) was the final addition, reserved for Métis veterans returning from World War II before being thrown open to general settlement in 1951. The Marlboro Settlement was established north of Marlboro, Alberta, a small community on the Canadian National Railway mainline. The area was estimated to contain some five to six hundred million feet of mature pine and spruce forest. With no land suitable for agricultural purposes, a 1941 report of the Alberta Bureau of Public Welfare recorded no settlers having taken residence in the area, and $49.51 spent on tentatively acquiring livestock was the only recorded expenditure ever taken by the province towards improving the Marlboro settlement. At this time, the Métis were reported to have withdrawn their request for a settlement in the district. The Métis Nation of Alberta maintained a local organization in the Marlboro townsite for many decades after the withdrawal of the Marlboro Settlement. The Marlboro Local persisted until the 1980s, when it was disbanded by Russel Plante, its final president. ==Geography== The Marlboro settlement consisted of approximately five townships, bounded by the Athabasca River on its west side. A rugged and heavily forested region, no paved highway or populated place exists within these boundaries today. ===Legal land description=== The exact boundaries of the Marlboro settlement, as described in its enabling legislation, are as follows: ==References== Category:Former Métis settlements in Alberta Category:Yellowhead County ","title":"Marlboro Metis Settlement"},{"id":"61396323","text":"Ro-Pat-In Corporation (ElectRo-Patent-Instruments) was founded by Adolph Rickenbacher and George Beauchamp in 1931 to manufacture and distribute electrically amplified musical instruments.

TCF branch in Ypsilanti, Michigan. TCF Financial Corporation is a bank holding company based in Detroit, Michigan. The current incarnation of the company was formed by a 2019 merger between the former TCF, which was established in 1923 in Wayzata, Minnesota, and the Michigan-based Chemical Financial Corporation. ==History== The company traces its roots to both TCF Financial Corporation and Chemical Financial Corporation, which merged in 2019. ===Chemical Financial Corporation=== Chemical State Savings Bank was founded in 1917. In 1937, the headquarters of Chemical Bank was the site of the infamous bank robbery by Tony Chebatoris, which resulted in Chebatoris being the only man to receive the death penalty in the state of Michigan. In 1964, the bank changed its name to Chemical Bank Trust. In 1974, the bank changed its name to Chemical Bank. In May 2010, the bank acquired O.A.K. Financial Corporation. In October 2014, the bank acquired Northwestern Bank for $121 million in cash. In April 2015, the bank acquired Monarch Community Bancorp for $27.2 million in stock. In June 2015, the bank acquired Lake Michigan Financial Corporation for $187.4 million in cash and stock. In August 2016, the bank acquired Talmer Bancorp for $1.7 billion in cash and stock. In 2017, David B. Ramaker, president and chief executive officer of the bank, retired and was succeeded by David T. Provost. On July 25, 2018, the company announced the move of its headquarters, along with over 500 employees, to Detroit. ===TCF Financial Corporation=== TCF Financial Corporation began business in 1923 as Twin City Building and Loan Association. In 1936, it was given a federal charter and renamed as Twin City Federal Savings and Loan Association. In 1986, it became a public company. In 1995, TCF increased its Michigan presence by acquiring the Great Lakes National Bank. From 1995 through 1998, the TCF Bank branches in Michigan operated under the Great Lakes National Bank name. In 1999, all of the branches were reflagged as TCF. It also acquired First Federal Savings Bank of Oakland County. In 1997, the bank acquired Winthrop Resources Corporation. In 2002, the University of Michigan announced that TCF Bank was selected as a preferred provider of banking services to students, faculty, and staff. The University terminated this agreement in 2015. In 2004, the bank acquired of VGM Leasing, Inc. In 2005, TCF Bank announced the sale of its Michigan headquarters building to Ann Arbor, Michigan real-estate company McKinley Associates, though part of the ground level remains a TCF Bank branch. On November 6, 2006, TCF announced the sale of 10 branches in Battle Creek, Bay City, and Saginaw to Independent Bank. Its first branch in Arizona was opened in Mesa, Arizona, on December 13, 2006. In 2008, TCF entered the commercial inventory finance business in the U.S. and Canada with the creation of TCF Inventory Finance, Inc. In 2011, TCF entered the indirect auto finance business with the acquisition of Gateway One Lending & Finance. It closed 37 branches in 2013 and another 33 in 2016. In some locations, it replaced the full-service branches with ATMs. ==ControversiesOverdraft fees=== In 2010, TCF Bank was sued regarding overdraft charges. The bank processed higher amount transactions first in order to drain customer accounts faster, allowing TCF to then increase the number of total overdraft charges from each of the smaller amounts remaining, as well as charging overdraft fees on a daily basis rather than posing one flat fee. In 2011, TCF Bank changed its overdraft policy to include a daily $28 fee. After public backlash, the bank reversed its policy in 2012. ===Violation of Bank Secrecy Act=== In January 2013, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency assessed a $10 million fine on TCF for violating the Bank Secrecy Act for failure to file suspicious activity reports in a timely fashion. == Sponsorship == TCF is the naming rights sponsor of the University of Minnesota's TCF Bank Stadium. In February 2019, it was announced that Chemical Financial had acquired the naming rights to Detroit's Cobo Center, which was renamed TCF Center in August 2019. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:1917 establishments in Michigan Category:Companies listed on NASDAQ Category:American companies established in 1917 Category:Banks established in 1917 Category:Banks based in Michigan ","title":"TCF Financial Corporation"},{"id":"61397025","text":"The South Australian Railways F Class (1st) Locomotives were built in 1869 by Avonside Engine Co of Bristol, England.

The G class lasted up to 1923 until they were all condemned. ==History== Only five of the G class locomotives were purchased new by the South Australian Railways from Beyer, Peacock and Company. The rest of the class were acquired upon the takeover of the Glenelg and Grange railway lines from private operators. On the 2nd of August 1873 the Adelaide, Glenelg and Suburban Railway Company opened a line between Adelaide and Glenelg via King William Street and South Terrace, Adelaide. This is the same line which is the current route used by Trams on the Glenelg tram line. On the 25th of May 1880 the Holdfast Bay railway line was officially opened and a line from the Adelaide railway station, North Terrace to Glenelg through Richmond and Plyptom. These two lines were eventually amalgamated in 1881 and formed the Glenelg Railway Company. The Glenelg Railway Company in turn passed over the Government control on the 15th of December 1899.

Similar to NFL, the lack of television stations led to NBC taking over the rights beginning the very next season until April 7, 1962 - NBC's first tenure with the NBA. ==1953-54== The contract had the DuMont Television Network televising 13 Saturday afternoon games. According to the book Tall Tales, NBA owners wanted the presumably \\"worst\\" game of the week to be shown on DuMont, because they were afraid if the \\"best\\" games were shown, it would negatively affect the gate for that game. Also, even though DuMont wanted the games on Saturday afternoons, a number of owners resisted because they feared that Saturday matinees would not draw as many people as a night game. The DuMont Network would televise 20 Saturday afternoon games the following season, paying $39,000 for the rights. DuMont's first game aired on December 12, 1953, with the Boston Celtics defeating the Baltimore Bullets 106-75. This was the only year of NBA coverage on DuMont; the Saturday afternoon package moved to NBC for the season, mainly because NBC could clear the games on far more stations that DuMont could. Games on DuMont were usually blacked out in the cities they were played in; for example, the three Boston Celtics home games included in the 1953-54 package were blacked-out in Boston, however, WJAR-TV in nearby Providence (whose signal covers most of the metropolitan Boston area) did carry the two regular-season Celtics' home games that were part of the DuMont package.Boston Globe, December 19, 1953, p.23Boston Globe, December 26, 1953, p.7 {  !Date !Teams !Commentators - 12/12/53 Baltimore @ Boston Marty Glickman and Curt Gowdy - 12/19/53 Syracuse @ Boston Marty Glickman and Curt Gowdy - 12/26/53 Boston @ Milwaukee Marty Glickman and John Reddy - 1/2/54 Philadelphia @ Syracuse Marty Glickman and Dick Grossman - 1/9/54 Minneapolis @ Milwaukee Marty Glickman and John Reddy - 1/16/54 Philadelphia @ Baltimore Marty Glickman - 1/23/54 Philadelphia @ Rochester Marty Glickman - 1/30/54 Milwaukee @ Minneapolis Marty Glickman - 2/6/54 Fort Wayne @ Syracuse Marty Glickman and Dick Grossman - 2/13/54 Syracuse @ Rochester Marty Glickman - 2/20/54 Fort Wayne @ Baltimore Marty Glickman - 2/27/54 Milwaukee @ Philadelphia Marty Glickman - 3/6/54 Philadelphia @ Syracuse Marty Glickman and Dick Grossman - 3/13/54 New York @ Syracuse Marty Glickman and Dick Grossman - 3/20/54 New York @ Boston Marty Glickman - 3/27/54 Minneapolis @ Rochester Marty Glickman - 4/3/54 Syracuse @ Minneapolis Marty Glickman - 4/10/54 Minneapolis @ Syracuse Marty Glickman } Marty Glickman and Lindsay Nelson called Games 2 and 5 of the 1954 NBA Finals for DuMont. ==1954-1959== NBC's first tenure with the National Basketball Association began on October 30, 1954 and lasted until April 7, 1962.

The League signed a contract with DuMont in its 8th season (1953–54), marking the first year the NBA had a national television broadcaster. Similar to NFL, the lack of television stations led to NBC taking over the rights beginning the very next season until April 7, 1962 - NBC's first tenure with the NBA. After the deal expired, Sports Network Incorporated (later known as the Hughes Television Network) signed up for two-year coverage in the 1962–63, 1963–64 season. ABC gained the NBA in 1964, the network aired its first NBA game on January 3, 1965, but lost the broadcast rights to CBS after the 1972–73 season with the initial tenure ending on May 10, 1973. ==1960-1962== As previously mentioned, NBC Sports first broadcast the NBA from the 1954–55 through 1961–62 seasons. The announcers during this period included: * Jerry Doggett (1960–1961) * Marty Glickman (1954–1961) * Jim Gordon (1954–55) * Curt Gowdy (1955–1960) * Chick Hearn (1957–1958) * Joe Lapchick (1955–56) * Lindsey Nelson (1954–1961) * Bill O'Donnell (1957–1960) * Bud Palmer (1958–1962) * Bob Wolff (1961–1962) ==1962-1963== For , SNI did two games. The first one being the All-Star Game at Los Angeles with Chick Hearn and Bud Blattner on the call. The second game was the sixth and deciding game of the NBA Finals between the Boston Celtics and Los Angeles Lakers with Bob Wolff on the call. *1962 NBA Finals – All of the games from Boston were televised in Los Angeles on Channel 9 (then called KHJ-TV) with Chick Hearn on play-by-play. For Game 7, Jack Drees joined the broadcast team. In addition, Chick Hearn indicated that Game 7 was being syndicated around the nation to a variety of cities. The game was broadcast in Boston by WHDH-TV, but the station originated its own broadcast with Don Gillis as the commentator. ==1963-1964== For , SNI broadcast a series of Thursday night games starting January 2. The broadcast teams during the regular season were Marty Glickman and Carl Braun for games in the Eastern Division and Bud Blattner and Ed Macauley for games in the Western Division. They also broadcast the All-Star Game from Boston with Marty Glickman and Bud Blattner sharing play-by-play duties and with Carl Braun and Ed Macauley doing analysis. SNI broadcast at least four playoff games starting on March 28 with St. Louis at Los Angeles with Jerry Gross on play-by-play and Ed Macauley on color commentary. The other games (all involving Marty Glickman on play-by-play) included: *Cincinnati at Boston on April 9 *St. Louis at San Francisco on April 16 *Boston at San Francisco on April 24 Carl Braun, Alex Hannum, and Fred Schaus were the respective analysts for the April 9, April 16, and April 24 playoff broadcasts. ==1964-1969== ABC first signed a deal with the National Basketball Association to become the league's primary television partner in 1964; the network's first game telecast aired on January 3, 1965 (a game between the Boston Celtics and Cincinnati Royals).Source: ABC ad for NBA game in Chicago Tribune (January 3, 1965) For much of the 1960s, ABC only televised Sunday afternoon games, including during the NBA Playoffs. This meant that ABC did not have to televise a potential NBA Finals deciding game if it were played on a weeknight. In 1969, ABC did televise Game 7 of the Los Angeles Lakers–Boston Celtics series in prime time on a weeknight. The following season, ABC aired the 1970 NBA Finals in its entirety, making it the first Finals series to have all games televised nationally. Commentators for the original NBA on ABC included play-by-play announcers Keith Jackson and Chris Schenkel, and analysts Jack Twyman, Bob Cousy and Bill Russell. On April 8, 1967, a strike by the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA) forced ABC Sports producer Chuck Howard and director Chet Forte to call Game 4 of the Eastern Conference Finals between Boston Celtics and Philadelphia 76ers, as its regular announcing team were members of the union. Curt Gowdy also served on play-by-play for half of the 1967–68 season. The first nationally televised Christmas Day NBA broadcast occurred in , when ABC broadcast a game between the Los Angeles Lakers and San Diego Rockets from the then-San Diego Sports Arena in San Diego. Jerry Gross and Jack Twyman called that particular broadcast for the network. ABC would continue to televise Christmas games through . The remainder of these broadcasts were based from Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Phoenix. Chris Schenkel did play-by-play for ABC during this period with the exception of , when Keith Jackson held that responsibility. Jack Twyman remained as color commentator for the broadcasts up until , when the position was assumed by Bill Russell. ABC lost the broadcast rights to the NBA to CBS after the 1972–73 season, with the network's initial tenure with the league ending with its last NBA Finals game on May 10, 1973. *1969 NBA Finals – Game 7 was televised by ABC in prime time. *In Game 4 of the 1965 Finals, the Boston Celtics beat the Los Angeles Lakers 112 to 99.

The story is narrated by the saint poet Valmiki and tells the tale of a North Indian Prince Rama of the city of Ayodhya, who is banished into the forest along with his wife Sita and brother Lakshmana. During the exile, Sita gets kidnapped by the demon king Ravana of Lanka, and Rama with the help of a Vanara (primate like forest dwellers) army rescues Sita from Lanka. The tale has parallels to the Greek Iliad, the details however differing The original set in Sanskrit consists of 24,000 verses, and there are several variations in the story narrated in South Asian and South East Asian cultures, across India, Thailand and Indonesia, with several versions re-written in various Asian and Indian languages. There are earlier references of Ramayana in Sangam literature (300 B.C - 300 A.D), but the earliest known written version of Ramayana in the Tamil language, in the 12th century AD, by Kambar as Ramavataram (popularly known as Kamba Ramayanam). However, there are references to the Ramayana story in earlier Tamil literature, dating back as the early Tamil literature in CE, which indicate that the story was known in the Tamil lands much before Kamba Ramayana in the 12th century. ==Sangam Literature== The age of Sangam literature (Tamil: சங்க இலக்கியம், caṅka ilakkiyam) refers to the ancient Tamil literature written up to AD 100. ===Purananuru=== The earliest reference to the story of the Ramayana is found in the Purananuru which is dated from early 300BC. Purananuru 378, attributed to the poet UnPodiPasunKudaiyar, written in praise of the Chola king IlanCetCenni. The poem makes the analogy of a poet receiving royal gifts and that worn by the relatives of the poet as being unworthy for their status, to the event in the Ramayana, where Sita drops her jewels when abducted by Ravana and these jewels being picked up red- faced monkeys who delightfully wore the ornaments (Hart and Heifetz, 1999, pp. 219–220). ===Akanaṉūṟu=== Akanaṉūṟu, which is dated between 400BC and 200BC, has a reference to the Ramayana in poem 70. The poem places a triumphant Rama at Dhanushkodi, sitting under a Banyan tree, involved in some secret discussions, when the birds are chirping away. ==Twin Epics of the Common EraSilappatikaram=== The Silappatikaram (translated as The Tale of an anklet) written by a prince turned Jain monk Ilango Adigal, dated around the 2nd century AD. The epic narrates the tale of Kovalan, son of a wealthy merchant, his wife Kannagi, and his lover Madhavi, and has many references to the Ramayana story. It describes the fate of Poompuhar suffering the same agony as experienced by Ayodhya when Rama leaves for exile to the forest as instructed by his father (Dikshitar, 1939, p. 193). The Aycciyarkuravai section (canto 27), makes mention of the Lord who could measure the three worlds, going to the forest with his brother, waging a war against Lanka and destroying it with fire (Dikshitar, 1939, p. 237). This seems to imply on Rama being regarded as divinity, rather than a mere human. These references indicate that the Tamil people or at least the author was well aware of the story of the Ramayana in the 2nd century AD. ===Manimekalai=== Manimekalai written as the sequel to the Silappatikaram by the Buddhist poet Chithalai Chathanar, narrates the tale of Manimekalai, the daughter of Kovalan and Madhavi, and her journey to become a Buddhist Bhikkuni. This epic also makes several references to the Ramayana, such as a setu (bridge) being built by monkeys in canto 5, line 37 (however the location is Kanyakumari rather than Dhanushkodi). In another reference, in canto 17, lines 9 to 16, the epic talks about Rama being the incarnate of Trivikrama or Netiyon, and he building the setu with the help of monkeys who hurled huge rocks into the ocean to build the bridge. Further, canto 18, lines 19 to 26, refers to the illegitimate love of Indra for Ahalya the wife of Rishi Gautama(Pandian, 1931, p. 149)(Aiyangar, 1927, p. 28). ==Alvar literature== The alvars, (also spelt as alwars or azhwars) were Vaishnavite Tamil poets -saints of South India who composed literature preaching bhakti (devotion) to the god Vishnu or his avatar. Modern scholars place alvar literature between the 5th and 10th Centuries CE ===Kulasekhara Alvar=== Kulasekhara Alvar is the seventh in the line of the 12 Alvars. Kulasekhara Alvar rules as the Chera king of Travancore, with scholars dating his period as first half of the 9th century CE. The King gradually takes interest in religious matters, much to the concern of his ministers. On a certain occasion, on hearing the narration of the Ramayana incident of Rama standing up to the battle against demons, he plunges into the sea to swim to Ceylon to rescue Sita. His compositions include the Perumal Thirumozhi in Tamil and Mukundamala in Sanskrit (Hooper, 1929, p. 20). ===Thirumangai Alvar=== The Periya Thirumozhi, written by Thirumangai Alvar (8th century CE) in verse 8, refers to Guhan, the fisherman king who Rama persuades not to follow him into exile while crossing the Ganges, and Hanuman the son of the wind god Vayu(Hooper, 1929, p. 41). ===Andal=== Andal's Thiruppavai, verse 12 makes mention of the Lord Rama who slew the Lord of Lanka, Ravana (Hooper, 1929, p. 53). ===Nammalvar=== Nammalvar's Tiruviruttam, verse 36, speaks of the friend of the Alwar who criticises the Lord who once destroyed the crowded halls of Lanka (for the sake of Sita), but fails to relieve the grief of the Alvar (Hooper, 1929, p. 71). ==Influence on Tamil Kingdoms References == Category:Tamil-language literature Category:Sangam literature Category:Ramayana ","title":"Ramayana in Tamil literature"},{"id":"61397194","text":"Virgibacillus natechei is a Gram-positive and moderately halophilic bacterium from the genus of Virgibacillus which has been isolated from sediments from a saline lake from Bechar in Algeria. ==References== Category:Bacillaceae Category:Bacteria described in 2016 ","title":"Virgibacillus natechei"},{"id":"61397200","text":"Country Arts SA is statutory corporation created by the South Australian government under the provisions of the South Australian Country Arts Trust Act (1992), for the purpose of delivering arts to regional South Australia.

The project funded by the Department of Science and Technology is a collaboration of the Aklan State University (ASU), the Maritime Industry Authority (MARINA), the Philippine Council for Industry, Energy and Emerging Technology Research and Development, Metallica and the Aklan Congressional Office. The project was delayed due issues of government- related bureaucracy. As part of the project, a prototype of a ship powered by both gas and waves will be constructed and if found feasible will be offered to interested parties. In February 2018, the DOST pledged a budget of for the ship project. MARINA's involvement in the project is to ensure the finished product would meet international safety and emission standards. The project is planned to be named as \\"Dual Stroke Cylinder Pumps with 30 Units Working\\" or \\"Duterte\\" for short. ==Construction== The implementation of the Hybrid Trimaran project will be made in two phases, the construction of the watercraft, and the development of technology that would enable the vessel to devise wave technology. The keel laying for the ship was held on December 2018.

Waves gathered from the vessel's outriggers will drive the double action hydraulic pumps which will generate power for the ship. Multi-engine technology will be used as a precaution against total engine failure and the ship's structure will be designed in a way that would minimize it chances of capsizing. The ship will be made of steel. It is envisioned to be a combined passenger and cargo vessel, smaller but similar to a Roll-on/roll-off (RoRo) ship.

The State Trail is planned as a hiking trail connecting the Town of Valdese, the City of Hickory, the Overmountain Victory National Historic Trail, South Mountains State Park and Chimney Rock State Park The trail is a collaboration between local governments and the state, with development coordinated by the North Carolina Division of Parks and Recreation (NCDPR). ==History== The trail started out of interest in creating a state park along the Jacob Fork River and Henry Fork River in Catawba County. On May 17, 2018, State Senator Andy Wells introduced a bill in the North Carolina General Assembly to create a Jacob Fork State Natural Area in Catawba County. The bill failed to pass, but support for the concept grew. Over the Fall of 2018, Catawba County, the City of Hickory, City of Newton, and the Town of Long View adopted resolutions in support of a state park along the rivers. Hickory owned of undeveloped land along Jacob Fork, with access to US 321, which the city originally acquired for a never realized economic development project in the 1990s. In early 2019, the city donated the property to the Foothills Conservancy to help establish the state park. The Foothills Conservancy used the matching value of the city's donation to help them acquire of adjoining land along the river in April that year. The conservancy intends on holding onto the properties until NCDPR is able to acquire them. While the Foothills Conservancy was acquiring land for the state park system, another bill was introduced in the General Assembly to establish the Wilderness Gateway State Trail. Since the headwaters of Jacob Fork and Henry Fork are in South Mountains State Park, legislators reasoned authorizing a state trail along them would improve public access to the existing state park, while simultaneously permitting the NCDPR to acquire land along the rivers in Catawba County. The bill included a directive for NCDPR to study feasible routes for the trail, while also considering ways to improve access from Interstate 40 to South Mountains State Park. It requires NCDPR to report on its findings by December 1, 2019. The bill was signed into law on June 3, 2019.. In September 2020 Foothills Conservancy received a $1.2 million North Carolina Land and Water Fund Grant to acquire 1,126 acres in McDowell County for the trail. ==ReferencesWilderness Gateway State Trail Study Category:State parks of North Carolina Category:Protected areas of Burke County, North Carolina Category:Protected areas of Catawba County, North Carolina Category:Protected areas established in 2019 Category:Hiking trails in North Carolina Category:2019 establishments in North Carolina ","title":"Wilderness Gateway State Trail"},{"id":"61397226","text":"ABC gained the NBA in 1964, the network aired its first NBA game on January 3, 1965, but lost the broadcast rights to CBS after the 1972–73 season with the initial tenure ending on May 10, 1973. As the national broadcaster of the NBA, CBS aired NBA games from the 1973-74 until the 1989–90 season, during which the early 1980s is notoriously known as the tape delay playoff era. NBA entered the cable territory in 1979 when USA Network signed a three-year $1.5 million deal and extended for two years until the 1983-84 season, ESPN also had a brief affair with NBA from 1982 to 1984. ==1970-1973== For much of the 1960s, ABC only televised Sunday afternoon games, including during the NBA Playoffs. This meant that ABC did not have to televise a potential NBA Finals deciding game if it were played on a weeknight. In 1969, ABC did televise Game 7 of the Los Angeles Lakers–Boston Celtics series in prime time on a weeknight. The following season, ABC aired the 1970 NBA Finals in its entirety, making it the first Finals series to have all games televised nationally. Commentators for the original NBA on ABC included play-by-play announcers Keith Jackson and Chris Schenkel, and analysts Jack Twyman, Bob Cousy and Bill Russell. Jack Twyman remained as color commentator for the broadcasts up until , when the position was assumed by Bill Russell. ABC lost the broadcast rights to the NBA to CBS after the 1972–73 season, with the network's initial tenure with the league ending with its last NBA Finals game on May 10, 1973. *1970: The first NBA Finals to be nationally televised in full. **ABC's coverage of Game 7 was blacked out on WABC-TV in the New York area. Play-by-play man Chris Schenkel made an announcement during the broadcast that the game would be rebroadcast in New York at 11:30 p.m. ET. The game was shown live on the MSG Network in New York City, which was then only available in about 25,000 cable households in Manhattan. ==1973-1976== During CBS' first few years of covering the NBA, CBS was accused of mishandling their NBA telecasts. Among the criticisms included CBS playing too much loud music, the lack of stability with the announcers, regionalizing telecasts (thus fragmenting the ratings even further), billing games as being between star players instead of teams, and devoting too much attention to the slam dunk in instant replays. Regular features included a pre-game show that consisted of mini-teams of celebrities, and active and former NBA players competing against each other, and a halftime show called Horse. The NBA eventually took notice of the criticisms and managed to persuade CBS to eliminate its original halftime show. In its place, came human-interest shows about the players (similar to the ones seen on the network's NFL pre-game The NFL Today). There also was a possibility that CBS would start televising a single national game on Sunday afternoons. Other adjustments that CBS made in hopes of improving its coverage included hiring reporter Sonny Hill to cover the league on a full-time basis. CBS also put microphones and cameras on team huddles to allow viewers to see and hear coaches at work. Finally, CBS introduced a halftime segment called Red Auerbach on Roundball, featuring the Hall of Fame Boston Celtics coach. The segment intended to not only educate CBS' viewers about the complexities of the pro game, but also to teach young players how to improve their skills. They also subtly introduced audiences to an all-star team based on Auerbach's criteria such as screening and passing. In a Red on Roundball halftime segment which appeared on CBS' NBA telecasts in the 1973–74 season, Auerbach and referee Mendy Rudolph discussed and demonstrated the practice of flopping with obvious disapproval. From 1975 to 1979, CBS aired all NBA Finals games live (usually during the afternoon); live NBA Finals game coverage on the network resumed in 1982. During this era, CBS aired weeknight playoff games from earlier rounds on tape delay at 11:30 p.m. Eastern Time (airing games live when the game site was in the Pacific Time Zone). CBS continued this practice until at least the mid-1980s. CBS did not want sportscasters to give the final score on the late-evening newscasts aired by its local affiliates. The network preferred the games to not be over by that time if they were going to be aired on tape later that night. Most CBS games were either 8:30 or 9:00 p.m. local starts. *1976 NBA Finals: There were three days of rest between Game 1 Sunday, May 23 and Game 2 Thursday, May 27, so that CBS would not have to count an NBA game in the Nielsen ratings for the May sweeps period. The 1976 May sweeps period ended Wednesday, May 26. **Game 3 tipped off at 10:30 a.m. MST to allow CBS to cover The Memorial golf tournament following the game. Church attendance that Sunday was sharply lower across Arizona, drawing an angry response from many clergy throughout the state. **CBS play-by-play announcer Brent Musburger, in a Fall 2009 interview with ESPN, said that he and color announcer Rick Barry were rooting for Phoenix to win Games 3, 4, and 6, although Barry's Golden State Warriors were eliminated by the Suns in the Western Conference Finals. Musburger said that this was because he and Barry were paid by the game. Since the Series was 2-0 Boston after the first two games, Musburger and Barry wanted the Suns to win the next two games to tie the series (likewise with Game 6). Boston fans, unaware of Musburger's and Barry's motivations, were upset with the announcing crew because of their apparent favoritism. ==1976-1977== During the 1976–77 season, the NBA's first after the ABA–NBA merger brought the American Basketball Association into the league, CBS held a slam dunk contest that ran during halftime of the Game of the Week telecasts. Don Criqui was the host of this particular competition. The final, which pitted Larry McNeill of the Golden State Warriors against eventual winner Darnell \\"Dr. Dunk\\" Hillman of the Indiana Pacers, took place during Game 6 of the 1977 NBA Finals. At the time of the final, Hillman's rights had been traded to the New York Nets, but he had not yet signed a contract. Since he was not officially a member of any NBA team, instead of wearing a jersey, he competed in a plain white tank top. Then for the post-competition interview, Hillman donned a shirt with the words \\"Bottle Shoppe\\" – the name of an Indianapolis liquor store, which is still in existence, and was the sponsor of a city parks softball league team for which Hillman played left field (and the only team he was a member of at the time). Other players to compete in the slam dunk tournament included Julius Erving, George Gervin, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Moses Malone. CBS, anxious for star power, also gave David Thompson the opportunity to be eliminated three times. *1977 NBA Finals: The post-game trophy presentation following Game 6 was never aired because CBS decided to air the Kemper Open following the game. Initially CBS wanted a 10:30 a.m. PT start to accommodate the golf tournament but the NBA refused, instead settling for the 12:00 p.m. PT start time. ==1977-1978== During the 1977–78 season, CBS held a H-O-R-S-E competition at halftime of the Game of the Week telecasts. Again, Don Criqui hosted with Mendy Rudolph officiating. 32 players, including Rick Barry, Pete Maravich, George Gervin, JoJo White, Doug Collins, Paul Westphal and Bob McAdoo, competed in a round- robin single-elimination tournament each week. Barry was eliminated in the first round by journeyman Earl Tatum of the Los Angeles Lakers. Maravich and Westphal made it all the way to the final, which was scheduled to take place at halftime of Game 2 of the 1978 NBA Finals. However, Maravich was injured and unavailable, so CBS instead had Westphal shoot a free-throw against \\"Bag- Man\\" (who was actually Rick Barry, who was on the announcing team, wearing a paper sack over his head). Westphal, with a bag over his head as well, made the free throw while Barry missed, and CBS awarded him the trophy. By 1978, NBC aired Saturday afternoon college basketball games, while CBS aired NBA doubleheaders on Sunday afternoons, and most independent stations aired local professional and college games. CBS started to fear that their ratings suffered as a result of too many basketball games being aired on television at once.

On March 16, 2020, despite having already canned its episodes, the show suspended airings and its production was put on hiatus due 2020 Luzon enhanced community quarantine in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines. Its timeslot was temporarily filled by Wildflower, iWant Originals and Tubig at Langis. Thereafter, the show's future would be placed in doubt after the temporary closure of ABS-CBN following the cease and desist order issued by the National Telecommunications Commission on account of its franchise expiration. However, on June 4, 2020, it was announced that the show would make its return on June 15, 2020 with a brand new season on cable-and- satellite channel Kapamilya Channel. ==ReceptionRatings=Controversies=== Depiction of Butuan City The show came under fire early in the show's run for its perceived \\"unrealistic\\" and \\"offensive\\" depiction of Butuan. The scene in question was from the show's pilot episode showing the bombing of a market in the city. In a statement, Agusan del Norte 1st District Representative Lawrence Fortun asked ABS-CBN “to immediately air an appropriate disclaimer, review and reconsider the content and story elements of the teleserye in order not to further besmirch the reputation of our historic city.” ABS-CBN, for its part, apologized on January 23, 2020. Its statement read: “ABS-CBN would like to apologize to Agusan Del Norte Rep. Lawrence Fortun and the people of Butuan City if the scenes in the TV series ‘A Soldier’s Heart’ have offended them. While the incident portrayed in the series was fictitious, there was mention of the city name.” “We would like to assure them that there was no deliberate intention to portray Butuan City negatively in the show. We acknowledge that Butuan is one of the most beautiful and peaceful cities in the country,” it added. On January 24, 2020, ABS-CBN executives headed by Cory Vidanes and Laurenti Dyogi met with Fortun to further clear the issue. After said meeting, Fortun noted that aside from airing specific disclaimers, ABS-CBN has removed all production elements, scenes, and references that may be offensive to Butuan. ==See also== * List of programs broadcast by ABS-CBN * List of programs broadcast by Kapamilya Channel * List of ABS-CBN drama series ==ReferencesCategory:ABS-CBN drama series Category:Philippine action television series Category:Philippine military television series Category:2020 Philippine television series debuts Category:2020 Philippine television series endings Category:Filipino-language television shows Category:Television shows set in the Philippines Category:Television productions suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic ","title":"A Soldier's Heart"},{"id":"61397268","text":"Virgibacillus olivae is a Gram-positive and spore-forming bacterium from the genus of Virgibacillus which has been isolated from waste water from olives from La Roda in Spain. ==References== Category:Bacillaceae Category:Bacteria described in 2007 ","title":"Virgibacillus olivae"},{"id":"61397280","text":"Directorate of Labour () is a Bangladesh government regulatory agency under the Ministry of Labour and Employment responsible for regulating the labour market in Bangladesh.

It is located approximately 50 kilometres west of Sudbury. It is owned and operated by Vale Limited, notable in the area for its mining operations. The power from the plant is primarily supplied to these operations, with excess power sold to Ontario Hydro. The generating plant works in conjunction with High Falls Dams No. 1 and 2, as well as the 'Big Eddy' generating plant, in a cascade system, where excess water power from upstream dams is utilized by the downstream ones. ==HistoryEarly history=== Nairn Falls before construction had begun. Before the period of European colonization, the Spanish River was used as a transportation corridor by the indigenous people of the First Nations (primarily the Ojibwe) as an important route connecting Lake Huron's North Channel to the area now known as Sudbury, as well as many areas deep in the continental interior of Northern Ontario. People would migrate up and down the river seasonally, spending summers closer to the river mouth in the south, and migrating north to winter camps at Biscotasing. With the advent of railways in the Manitoulin-North Shore region, it became increasingly practical to develop resource extraction industries in the area for export. Logging operations upstream would send logs downstream to be processed at Nairn and Espanola and ultimately be shipped out by rail. As rail corridors in the area matured, logging operations gradually ceased using the river for transportation and instead began to use the railways; this was cemented by the creation of a number of power plants along the river, starting with High Falls in 1904. ===Dam construction=== The Nairn Falls dam was constructed by the Mond Nickel Company. A rival of the more powerful International Nickel Company (Inco), the company had rapidly developed a number of mine sites and company towns to the west of Sudbury, many of which were served by the Algoma Eastern Railway and Canadian Pacific Railway lines, which ran roughly parallel to each other, with the AER to the north and the CPR to the south in that section. Both lines served a mixture of pre-existing communities and company towns for both Inco and Mond. The two lines crossed each other just west of Nairn, then paralleled each other before crossing the Spanish River. The development of railway infrastructure passing through otherwise undeveloped Canadian bush created the opportunity for power lines to be erected, allowing an electrical corridor to be created running down the line to mine sites like Victoria Mines, the Crean Hill mine, and the Worthington mine. The AER line was routed more closely to the Spanish River, creating engineering challenges due to the rough geography around the river, but also creating some opportunities. With the outbreak of the First World War, the market for nickel grew dramatically and Mond began to step up production at its mine sites. There was mounting pressure to establish a new wave of power plants which could power the mines and smelters, which were in the process of converting from steam to electric power. Nairn Falls was a convenient site, already located near the AER line and relatively close to the existing mining operations. Construction began in 1914 and was completed in 1915, \\"all but [obliterating]\\" the small pre-existing waterfall. The power plant became operational later that year, and was managed under a Mond Company subsidiary known as the Lorne Power Company, which also managed the Lorne Falls power plant, built in 1909 on the Vermilion River. Both plants provided 60 Hz power to Mond's operations, in contrast to the 25 Hz produced by Inco's Huronian Power Company. ===Early operations=== The plant complex employed four full-time workers, with one relief worker for holidays. Despite being only a short distance from Nairn, which had by then grown into a mature railway town and primary point of access to the outside world, a small town site was laid out, consisting of two three-bedroom houses, as well as the \\"club house\\", which was run by a live-in cook and which served as a boarding house for maintenance workers. The powerhouse at the dam was the very first local telephone service subscriber in April 1917 and as a result was assigned a phone number of 1. During the 1920s, the Mond Company began to decline, a process which was accelerated by the catastrophic collapse of the Worthington mine. The company and its assets were merged into Inco, and its power generation subsidiary, the Lorne Power Company, was merged into Inco's Huronian Power Company. In 1930, the Algoma Eastern Railway was acquired by the CPR, which quickly began to abandon sections of the railway which paralleled its own track and which were considered to be redundant. The track from Espanola to Turbine (aside from the Little Current spur) was abandoned in 1931, including the section which ran next to the plant. The plant gradually became more secluded and separated from the nearby communities, especially as Inco abandoned the on-site worker housing and switched to using general operational and maintenance crews, and as rail traffic, including passenger rail, ceased along the old AER line. The Second World War brought increasing concern and paranoia of German saboteurs. This was largely a renewal of the anti-German sentiment of the First World War, which brought suspicion and persecution onto ethnic German civilians living in Canada. Security generally increased at major industrial complexes, railways, canals, and harbours. As a precaution, Inco hired four armed security guards, two full-time and two relief, who patrolled the Spanish River dam complexes. No form of sabotage ever took place. By 1952, Nairn Falls was powering operations at Garson mine, Lawson quarry, Creighton, and the Copper Cliff and Coniston smelters. ==Status== Today, the power plant continues to operate and supply power to Vale operations around Sudbury, as well as to the Ontario Hydro power grid. The Spanish River remains popular with cottagers and boaters, but the area around the plant is off-limits and remains Vale private property. The right- of-way of the defunct Algoma Eastern Railway near the plant has been divided up, with the bush allowed to regrow over some portions of the raised track bed, but another section has been used as an access road for the plant. This road intersects with Ferry Street in the town of Nairn, which marks the road to the former ferry service across the Spanish River to the \\"Headquarters\\" area to the north. The area around the river, which was once completely logged out, began to see tree regrowth and reforestation throughout the latter part of the 20th century, which has given the area its current character and increased its recreational and wilderness appeal. This also serves to obscure the plant from view, especially as it is some distance both from the town of Nairn and the current Ontario Highway 17 route, though it is only a short distance from the old Highway 17 (now McIntyre Street). The plant and associated falls area are visible from the Spanish River itself, especially downstream. ==See also== * List of generating stations in Canada * List of generating stations in Ontario ==References== Category:Hydroelectric power stations in Ontario Category:Dams in Ontario Category:Energy infrastructure completed in 1915 Category:Buildings and structures in Sudbury District ","title":"Nairn Falls Dam and Generating Plant"},{"id":"61397315","text":"The South Australian Railways Ga Class Locomotive was built in 1874 by Robert Stephenson and Company for the Adelaide Glenelg & Suburban Railway Company and entered service as No. 3.

He was the father of the famous author, Prosper Mérimée. == Biography == His father was François Merimée (c. 1715-1795), a lawyer at the Parlement de Rouen and author of \\"Treatise on fiefs and feudal rights in Normandy according to the natural order of matters and procedure divided into 5 parts (1760). He also served as a steward for the Maréchal de Broglie. He studied at the Collège de Caen before entering the Académie royale de peinture in 1778, where he studied with Gabriel-François Doyen and François-Élie Vincent. His fellow students included Charles Meynier, Jacques-Augustin-Catherine Pajou and Charles Thévenin. In 1787, he was awarded second place in the Prix de Rome and achieved third place in 1788. This was followed by a trip to Holland, where he studied the Dutch Masters, after which he went to Rome. He stayed there until 1793, when certain events of the Revolution forced him to return home. He was given housing by the \\"Société Populaire et Républicaine des Arts\\" at the Louvre, where he undertook research on methods of preserving art by means of chemistry. In 1796, he began formal training on the conservation and restoration of paintings. He was removed from his position at the École centrale des Travaux publics during the Bourbon Restoration, but remained as \\"Perpetual Secretary\\" of the École des beaux-arts de Paris. In 1802, he married Anne Moreau (1774-1852), a portrait painter who was the granddaughter of Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont. That same year, he held his final exhibition at the Salon. Thereafter Mérimée turned his attention to the history of art and in particular, the chemistry, use and application of pigment color and oil paint. Mérimée performed numerous experiments on the composition of paintings including those of Raphael, Leonardo da Vinci and Titian. He was also interested in the manufacture of paper, engraving, weaving and metallurgy. In 1830, Mérimée published the results of his work, which had a major influence on the modern process of restoration: De la peinture à l’huile : ou, Des procédés matériels employés dans ce genre de peinture, depuis Hubert et Jean Van-Eyck jusqu’à nos jours (1830). An English translation by W. B. Sarsfield Taylor was published in London in 1839. While the majority of this book was devoted to pigment analysis, varnishes, materials and the preservation of paintings, Mérimée devoted a chapter to color theory. In this chapter, Mérimée referred to \\"three simple colours (yellow, red and blue)\\" and that these can through admixture, produce a large gamut of color nuances. Ünited in pairs, these three primitive colours give birth to three other colours as distinct and brilliant as their originals; thus, yellow mixed with red, gives orange; red and blue, violet, and green is obtained by mixing blue and yellow\\" (Mérimée, 1839, p245). Mérimée illustrated these color relationships with a simple diagram located between pages 244 and 245: Chromatic Scale (Echelle Chromatique).Chromatic Scale (Echelle Chromatique), J. F.

Turner Sports obtained rights to air NBA games beginning with the 1984–85 season (replacing ESPN and USA Network as national cable partners) under a four-year deal, in which TBS shared the NBA television package along with CBS. In the summer of 1987, Turner Broadcasting System signed a new joint broadcast contract between TBS and TNT to split broadcast NBA games starting from the 1988–89 season. TNT held rights to broadcast the NBA draft, most NBA regular season and playoff games, while TBS only aired single games or doubleheaders once a week. ==Year-by-year summary1980=== By the 1979–1980 season, the network's NBA ratings had bottomed, with a regular season rating for the broadcasts at 6.4. By this time, the network had eliminated its regional coverage and only used two play-by-play announcers (Brent Musburger and Gary Bender) and three color commentators (Bill Russell and Rod Hundley, who teamed with Musburger and Rick Barry, who teamed with Bender); CBS felt that showing an NBA Finals game was not worth pre-empting their Friday night lineup (the smash hit Dallas in particular) during May sweeps (although the iconic episode in which J.R. Ewing was shot aired on March 21, 1980, and Dallas was already in summer reruns). The consensus was that a basketball game in prime time would have drawn fewer viewers. As a result, CBS used to regularly run NBA games in the 11:30 p.m. time slot (then occupied by The CBS Late Movie). For the 1980 and 1981 NBA Finals, CBS scheduled Games 3 and 4 on back-to-back days (Saturday and Sunday) to avoid an extra tape delay game. In 1980, the 26 share from 1976 had fallen to 18%. Ratings fell to a level where, as mentioned before, CBS began airing games on tape delay. The 1981 NBA Finals set the standard for futility, with an average rating of 6.7, the lowest in NBA history until the 2003 NBA Finals averaged a 6.5 on ABC. When it came time for CBS to broadcast Game 6 of the 1980 Finals (on Friday, May 16), the network gave its affiliates the option of either airing the game live or on tape delay (in fact, WAGA-TV in Atlanta did not carry the NBA on CBS for numerous years). If the affiliate chose to air the game later that night, then the prime time schedule would consist of reruns of The Incredible Hulk, The Dukes of Hazzard and Dallas (CBS, NBC and ABC ended the 1979–80 seasons in late March and early April in anticipation of a strike by the Screen Actors Guild, which came to fruition in July 1980). The clinching Game 6 of the 1980 Finals between the Los Angeles Lakers and Philadelphia 76ers was, most notably, aired live in the Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Portland and Seattle markets; CBS stations in the latter three markets were able to air the game live and still show most of the CBS prime time schedule since the game tipped at 6:00 p.m. Pacific Time. Otherwise, most CBS affiliates chose to air Game 6 on tape delay. The reason for this scheduling dilemma was the fact that the NBA had opted to start the regular season earlier. Starting in the mid-1970s, the NBA had pushed back the start of the regular season, resulting in it ending increasingly later (for example, April 6 in 1975, April 11 in 1976). Prior to that, the regular season had always ended in late March. For the 1979–1980 and 1980–1981 seasons, the NBA reverted to the earlier practice, with the season ending respectively on March 30, 1980 and March 29, 1981 (both falling on a Sunday). That meant that the Finals in those years began in the first week of May rather than the end of May, and as a result, the weeknight games were played during May ratings sweeps. Consequently, weeknight games held on the West Coast started at 8:30 p.m. Pacific Time, which was 11:30 p.m. in the Eastern Time Zone; those games could be shown live. However, non-West Coast weeknight games required tape- delay, to be shown at 11:30 p.m. *1980 NBA Finals: The series-deciding Game 6 became the most notorious example of CBS's practice of showing even the most important NBA games on \\"tape delay\\" broadcasts. Because May 16, 1980 was a Friday, the network did not want to preempt two of its highest-rated shows, The Dukes of Hazzard and Dallas, even though both shows were already in reruns: the 1979–80 TV season had ended early, back in March, in anticipation of a strike that summer by the Screen Actors Guild. So Game 6 was shown at 11:30pm Eastern (10:30pm Central) in all but four US cities: Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Portland and Seattle, who carried it live. The game was not broadcast at all in Atlanta. (This is often cited as an example of TV's lack of interest in the NBA in the \\"pre-Magic and Bird\\" era.) **On a side note, here, in Game 4 of the 1980 Finals, Julius Erving executed the legendary Baseline Move, an incredible, behind-the-board reverse layup that seemed to defy gravity. Play-by-play announcer Brent Musburger has noted that Erving made such moves almost routinely in his ABA days—but the ABA had no national TV contract in those days. This Game 4 move, played to a national audience in a title game, has probably become Julius Erving's most famous move. ===1981=== In 1980, USA televised two NBA games on Christmas Day. Jim Karvellas and Richie Powers called the early game involving New Jersey at Washington. Meanwhile, Eddie Doucette and Steve Jones called the late game involving Golden State at Portland. The 1980–1981 season was arguably the rock bottom point of the tape delay era for CBS. CBS aired four of the six Finals games on tape delay and six of nine during the Conference Finals. Just like the previous year, CBS scheduled Games 3 and 4 of the NBA Finals without an off- day to avoid yet another tape delayed game. CBS wanted the Pacific teams to advance in the playoffs so that they could show live games at 11:30 p.m. on the Eastern U.S.; however, the Los Angeles Lakers and Portland Trail Blazers were upset in Round 1, while the Phoenix Suns were upset in Round 2. This left two teams located in the Central Time Zone, the Houston Rockets and Kansas City Kings, to play in the Western Conference Finals. Between 1981 and 1983, ratings for CBS' NBA telecasts rose by 12%. CBS' highest-rated NBA game (and the only NBA game that scored more than 20 ratings points for the network) was Game 7 of the 1988 NBA Finals between the Lakers and the Detroit Pistons. By the end of its coverage, CBS' NBA ratings had been mostly respectable, with the lowest-rated Final after 1982 scoring a 12.3 (three times), a mark higher than any NBA Final since 1998. *From 1979-1981, CBS aired weekday NBA Finals games on tape delay if they were not played on the West Coast. Games were televised after the late local news (11:30 p.m.) in the CBS Late Movie time slot. In some cases, games were seen live in the cities whose local NBA teams were playing. In 1981 for example, WNAC-TV Boston and KHOU-TV Houston carried Games 1, 2, 5 and 6 live, although most viewers around the country had to wait until after the late local news to see them. **1981: The series between the Boston Celtics and the Houston Rockets was the lowest rated NBA Finals in history (6.7 rating over six games), until the 2003 NBA Finals drew only 6.5 percent of American television households. Four games of the 1981 series (Games 1, 2, 5 and the climatic Game 6) were telecast on tape delay outside of Boston and Houston. ***As previously mentioned, before 2003, the 1981 NBA Finals received the lowest television rating in NBA history. The 1981 Finals drew a 6.7 rating, according to Nielsen Media Research. Meanwhile, the 2003 Finals between the San Antonio Spurs and New Jersey Nets drew a 6.5 rating. Due to this, the 1981 Finals were the last to be broadcast on tape-delay, with weeknight games airing after the late local news in most cities. Games 3 and 4 were played back-to-back on Saturday and Sunday, May 9 and 10, to give CBS two live Finals games. Following the Finals, Gary Bender was relegated to tertiary play-by-play for the rest of his tenure in CBS, while Rick Barry's contract, following his questionable racial comments about Bill Russell during the Finals, was not renewed. Russell would remain the main color analyst for the next two years alongside newly promoted main play-by-play commentator Dick Stockton. Curiously, Barry and Russell would reunite, this time on the NBA on TBS during the mid-1980s. Russell was replaced as CBS' lead analyst following the 1983 Finals by former Celtics teammate Tom Heinsohn. ===1982=== During the 1981–82 season, Al Albert and Hubie Brown called the early game on USA while Eddie Doucette and Steve \\"Snapper\\" Jones called the late game. Hubie Brown was subsequently replaced by Jon McGlocklin as Al Albert's partner. Greg Gumbel and John Andariese were some of the voices of the original telecasts of The NBA on ESPN, which lasted only two seasons. Tom Mees was among the studio hosts. During a commercial break of a game at Madison Square Garden, the announcers (Greg Gumbel and Chris Berman) danced to the song \\"Little Darling\\" that was played on the public address system of the arena. That blooper reel is still often played when ESPN celebrates a milestone. Other announcers during this period1982–'83 NBA Announcing CrewsNBA Announcing Crews included: * Irv Brown (game analyst) * Ken Charles (game analyst) * Jim Simpson (play- by-play) * Roger Twibell (play-by-play) * Dick Vitale (game analyst) * Fred White (play-by-play) * Geoff Witcher (play-by-play) The '82 Finals marked the first time since 1978 that all of the games aired live in its entirely; As a compromise between CBS and the NBA, the season returned to late October after starting it in early October the previous two seasons, meaning that the championship series started after the conclusion of May sweeps. Also, Brent Musburger served as anchor for Game 1 in Philadelphia, but had to anchor Games 2 and 3 from New York, because he hosted CBS Sports Sunday. So anchoring the coverage in Musburger's absence were Frank Glieber (Games 2–4) and Pat O'Brien (Game 5). ===1983=== In the 1982–83 season, CBS significantly reduced the number of regular season broadcasts from 18 to four. The rationale was that cable television networks (namely, the USA Network and ESPN) were carrying a large number of regular season games (at least 40 each). In return, CBS executives believed that the public was being oversaturated with NBA coverage. *1983 NBA Finals: CBS joined Game 1 in progress with 7:37 left in the first period (meaning, there was no standard pregame coverage). Following the introduction montage (which was notable as it marked premiere of the intercutting, Bill Feigenbaum created CGI rendering of Boston Garden, used by CBS through the start of the 1989 Finals) with narration by anchor Brent Musburger, things were quickly passed off to play-by-play man Dick Stockton. ===1984=== For the 1983–84 season, CBS would televise just ten (out of 170 nationally) regular season games. Meanwhile, CBS televised about 16 playoff games. Popular belief holds that the peak era of the NBA on CBS occurred from 1984 to 1987. During this period, CBS' NBA coverage was the beneficiary of a new era in the league that would forever link two of the game's greatest players, Larry Bird and Magic Johnson. Bird and Johnson entered the NBA (coming off playing against each other in the highest-rated NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship of all time), respectively playing for the Boston Celtics and Los Angeles Lakers. The Lakers and Celtics, two iconic teams in large television markets, rose to prominence during the period; many credit the theatrics of Bird and Johnson to boosting the overall popularity of the NBA (especially during the tape delay era of NBA telecasts). Within three years of Johnson and Bird entering the league, the NBA had a Game of the Week on CBS, and ratings for Finals games approached levels rivaling those of the World Series. Prior to the Bird/Magic era, CBS used to televise approximately five to seven games regionally per week in a doubleheader format (1:45 and 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time) on Sundays. Ratings for regional were far outdrawn by NBC's college basketball coverage and ABC's Superstars program. After ratings bottomed out in 1980 and 1981, coinciding with CBS airing tape-delayed coverage, the network decided to scrap the regional telecasts. In its place CBS sold the marquee players and teams (for example, \\"Julius Erving and the Philadelphia 76ers\\", \\"Larry Bird and the Boston Celtics\\" or \\"Magic Johnson and the Los Angeles Lakers\\") for a \\"Game of the Week\\" broadcast. In 1984, CBS Sports' Lesley Visser (the then wife of lead NBA on CBS play-by-play announcer Dick Stockton) became the first woman to cover an NBA Finals. *1984: The 1984 championship series was the most watched in NBA history, with soaring TV ratings. ===1985=== As previously mentioned, TBS obtained rights to air NBA games beginning with the 1984–1985 seasonJune 6, 1984—TBS announces exclusive two-year NBA cable contract (extension through 1988 announced in February 1986 and extension through 1990 announced in November 1987). (replacing the ESPN and USA Network as the National Basketball Association's national cable partners) in which TBS shared the NBA television package along with CBS. When it began to televise games from NBA teams other than the Atlanta Hawks, TBS maintained a package of approximately 55 regular season NBA games annually on Tuesday and Friday nights. TBS also carried numerous NBA Playoff games as well as the NBA Draft from 1985–1989. On May 12, 1985, during halftime of the Boston Celtics-Philadelphia 76ers playoff game, CBS televised the first ever NBA Draft Lottery. ===1986=== Beginning in 1986, TBS televised the various contests from the NBA All-Star Weekend. In 1987, the slam dunk contest was televised live for the very first time on the network. 1986 was the last time CBS ever aired an NBA playoff game on tape delay, Game 3 of the Western Conference Finals between the Los Angeles Lakers and Houston Rockets, which was held on May 16 of that year. The game aired at 11:30 p.m. Eastern Time following a 9:30 p.m. tip. Also in 1986, CBS provided regional coverage of the Eastern Conference and Western Conference Finals games on May 18. As previously mentioned, this was the last time that any NBA Conference Finals game was not nationally televised. Game 3 of the 1986 NBA Finals in Houston was played during the midst of an electrical storm that knocked the picture out for approximately the first six minutes of the fourth quarter. Although the video was already on the fritz towards the end of the third, CBS announcer Dick Stockton waited for nearly three minutes before adjusting to a radio play-by-play. ===1987=== In 1987, CBS provided prime time coverage for Game 6 of the Eastern Conference Finals, marking the network's first pre-Finals prime time playoff telecast since 1975. CBS was able to do this because the NBA decided to push the Finals back from late May until early June. With the Finals starting a week later, the awkward long pauses between Games 1 and 2 were no longer required. Because of this, instead of Game 2 of the Finals being shown on the first night after sweeps ended, CBS could show Game 6 of the Conference Finals. Also in 1987, the NBA Finals hit a then-record rating of 15.9. James Brown was the sideline reporter for Games 3 and 4 (the latter being the Magic junior skyhook game) of the Finals because Pat O'Brien attended the birth of his son Sean Patrick. O'Brien called Games 1, 2, 5 and 6. In the summer of 1987, the Turner Broadcasting System signed a new joint broadcast contract between TBS and TNT effective with the 1988–89 NBA season; beginning that season, TBS and TNT split broadcast rights to televise NBA games. TNT held rights to broadcast the NBA Draft and most NBA regular season and playoff games, while TBS only aired single games or double-headers once a week. *1987 NBA Finals: James Brown was the sideline reporter for Games 3 and 4 (the latter being the Magic junior skyhook game) because Pat O'Brien attended the birth of son Sean Patrick. O'Brien called Games 1, 2, 5 and 6. **In 1987, the NBA Finals hit a then-record rating of 15.9. The 1990 NBA Finals was CBS' last, after nearly two decades televising the NBA. While the network broadcast every Bird-Magic Finals, it never broadcast any Final involving Michael Jordan, who, starting the year after CBS ended involvement with the league, would dominate the NBA in a way that neither Bird or Magic had. In 1990, the final year of the CBS deal, the regular season ratingTHE MEDIA BUSINESS; NBC and N.B.A. Agree to $750 Million Pact stood at a 5.2. (Each rating point represents 931,000 households.) ===1988=== *In 1988 NBA Finals, CBS achieved its only 20+ rating for an individual NBA game when the network got a 21.2 rating for Game 7 of the 1988 NBA Finals between the Lakers and Detroit Pistons. The Pistons would be in the next two NBA Finals, including a sweep the next year, and the lowest ratings CBS had seen in six years the year after that, with a 12.3 in 1990. ===1989=== By the late 1980s, CBS was telecasting 15 or 16 regular season games per year. In 1989 alone, only 13 of the 24 playoff games (Games 1–3, specifically) in Round 1 aired on TBS or CBS (for example, none of the four games from the Seattle-Houston first round series appeared on national television). Notably, Game 5 of the 1989 playoff series between the Chicago Bulls and Cleveland Cavaliers (featuring Michael Jordan's now famous game winning, last second shot over Craig Ehlo) was not nationally televised. CBS affiliates in Virginia elected to show the first game of a second round series between Seattle and the Lakers. Meanwhile, many CBS affiliates on the West Coast (such as KCBS-TV in Los Angeles and KPIX-TV in San Francisco) were able to broadcast at least a portion of the Chicago-Cleveland game. In Los Angeles, the hometown Lakers finished their game (started at the same time as the Chicago-Cleveland game) just in time for CBS to switch to the Chicago-Cleveland game, where, as it happened, Jordan made his game winner. The Portland Oregonian criticized CBS for its decision to show the Game 1 of the second round Seattle-Lakers series in Portland on KOIN rather than that game. Furthermore, CBS only broadcast the fifth game of the first-round series between Atlanta and Milwaukee nationally. The nationally televised Atlanta-Milwaukee game aired at 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time, while the regionally televised Chicago-Cleveland and Seattle/L.A. Lakers games aired at 3:30 p.m. Eastern Time. Perhaps even more confusing, both Game 5 sites (Coliseum at Richfield in Cleveland and Omni Coliseum in Atlanta) were in the Eastern Time Zone, so differing local start times were not a factor. Previously, CBS aired Game 2 of the Chicago-Cleveland series nationally, while relegating Game 2 of the Atlanta-Milwaukee series to TBS. CBS used its primary announcing team, Dick Stockton and Hubie Brown to call the latter game. *1989 NBA Finals: Pat O'Brien was the pre-game and halftime host for Game 2 because Brent Musburger was on assignment (Musburger was covering the College World Series for CBS). This was also in the case in 1988. This was Musburger's last NBA Finals assignment for CBS, as he was fired on April 1, 1990, months before NBA's television contract with CBS expired. Musburger moved to ABC and ESPN, and later called nine NBA Finals series for ESPN Radio between and . ==See also== *List of NBA Finals broadcasters#1980s *List of NBA All-Star Game broadcasters#1980s *List of NBA on ESPN broadcasters *NBA on television in the 1950s *NBA on television in the 1960s *NBA on television in the 1970s *NBA on television in the 1990s *NBA on television in the 2000s *NBA on television in the 2010s ==References== Category:Turner Sports Category:CBS Sports Category:ESPN Category:USA Network Sports Category:GMA Network Category:1980s in American television ","title":"NBA on television in the 1980s"},{"id":"61397339","text":"Virgibacillus profundi is a Gram-variable, moderately halophilic, endospore- forming and motile bacterium from the genus of Virgibacillus. ==References== Category:Bacillaceae Category:Bacteria described in 2018 ","title":"Virgibacillus profundi"},{"id":"61397353","text":"Sheth Gokuldas Tejpal or Sheth Goculdas Tejpal (1822–1867) was a merchant, businessman, social reformer and philanthropist from Mumbai, India.

Established by the 1938 Metis Population Betterment Act as a relief measure for the province's impoverished Métis people, the rough and swampy Cold Lake settlement was found to be unsuitable for agricultural purposes. However, it was retained as a division of the Elizabeth and Fishing Lake settlements, which lacked the abundant fish and timber readily available at Cold Lake. ==History== The Great Depression of the 1930s saw much deprivation among the nomadic Métis population of Alberta, estimated at about 11,000 in 1936. A royal commission was formed to investigate the living conditions of Alberta's \\"half-breeds\\" (as the Métis were known), who were then squatting on road allowances with no ready sources of cash income, or trapping in remote areas without access to education or health services. Métis children in urban areas were driven away from public schools by the ridicule and humiliation of white pupils, with an estimated 80% of the provincial Métis population receiving no education whatsoever. This Ewing Commission saw agriculture, particularly stock-raising, as the means by which the Métis could be made into \\"self-supporting citizens\\". Farm colonies, in which the Métis themselves would provide most of the physical labour, would be a suitably inexpensive relief scheme for the cash-strapped Alberta government to implement. Following these recommendations, the 1938 Metis Population Betterment Act enabled unoccupied Crown land to be set aside for the creation of new Métis settlements. Eleven were originally created by Order-in-Council through 1938 and 1939 – Wolf Lake, Utikuma Lake (now Gift Lake), Cold Lake, Marlboro, Keg River (now Paddle Prairie), Big Prairie (now Peavine), Touchwood, Goodfish Lake (now Kikino), Elizabeth, Fishing Lake, and East Prairie. Caslan (now Buffalo Lake) was the final addition, reserved for Métis veterans returning from World War Two before being thrown open to general settlement in 1951. The Cold Lake Settlement was established north of Cold Lake, adjoining Primrose Lake, with an additional fishing station on the north shore of Cold Lake. With considerable areas of muskeg and stony ridges impeding agriculture, a 1941 report of the Alberta Bureau of Public Welfare recorded no settlers having taken residence in the area. However, merchantable timber and fish were both present in abundance, so the settlement was retained to provide resources for the nearby Elizabeth and Fishing Lake settlements. Today, most of the inland portion of the former Cold Lake Settlement is occupied by the Cold Lake 149C Indian Reserve. ==Geography== The Cold Lake settlement consisted of two discontiguous parts: a rectangular half-township set back from the lakeshore proper, and a much smaller fishing station on Cold Lake itself. ===Legal land description=== The exact boundaries of the Cold Lake settlement, as described in its enabling legislation, are as follows: ==References== Category:Former Métis settlements in Alberta Category:Municipal District of Bonnyville No. 87 ","title":"Cold Lake Metis Settlement"},{"id":"61397570","text":"Cliff Daniels is an American crew chief currently employed with Hendrick Motorsports. ==Racing career== Cliff Daniels had a short racing career as a driver, racing late model cars at short tracks in his home state of Virginia before pursuing a mechanical engineering degree at University of North Carolina at Charlotte.

NBC then succeeded the broadcast rights from 1990 to 2002. During NBC's partnership with the NBA in the 1990s, the league rose to unprecedented popularity, with ratings surpassing the days of Magic Johnson and Larry Bird in the mid 1980s. Upon expiration of the contract in 2002, the league signed an agreement with ABC, which began airing games in the 2002-03 season. NBC had made a four-year $1.3 billion ($330 million/year) bid in the spring of 2002 to renew its NBA rights, but the league instead went to ESPN and ABC with a six-year deal worth $2.4 billion ($400 million/year), a total of $4.6 billion ($766 million/year) when adding the cable deal with Turner Sports. ==Year-by-year summary1990=== On November 9, 1989, the NBA and NBC reached an agreement on a four-year, US$600 million contract (beginning in the 1990–1991 season). The NBA’s popularity was skyrocketing by the late '80s and Commissioner David Stern wanted more exposure. This meant that he wanted more than 15 games a year shown on network television. However, CBS didn’t have the room to broadcast double and triple headers every Sunday like NBC could because of their NFL and college basketball coverage. Plus around this time, CBS had signed deals with Major League Baseball and the Winter Olympics, making it even more difficult to accommodate the NBA’s request for more over the air telecasts. All in all, CBS was by 1990 pretty much destined to cut ties with the NBA. From 1986 to its final year in 1990, CBS paid about US$47 million per year for the NBA broadcast contract. The final NBA game that CBS televised to date occurred on June 14, 1990. It was Game 5 of the NBA Finals between the Detroit Pistons and Portland Trail Blazers. The Pistons won the game 92–90 to clinch their second consecutive World Championship. As the soundtrack for their goodbye montage, CBS used \\"The Last Waltz\\" by The Band and Marvin Gaye's rendition of \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\" from the 1983 NBA All-Star Game, ending CBS Sports' relationship with the NBA after 17 years. While the network broadcast all five NBA Finals involving Larry Bird, all four NBA Finals involving Julius Erving, nine of the ten NBA Finals involving Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and eight of the nine NBA Finals involving Magic Johnson (with the exception of 1991, which was Magic Johnson's last and the first to be broadcast by NBC), it never broadcast a Final involving Michael Jordan. Prior to the closing montage, the network's final NBA game broadcast on June 14, 1990 ended with this sign-off by Dick Stockton: *Once Larry Bird and Magic Johnson retired, the NBA's ratings sank, at least for one year. The 1990 NBA Finals, (which was played before either Bird or Johnson retired) which registered a 12.3 rating (and was the last Finals CBS aired) was the lone NBA Finals between the domination of Bird and Magic and the domination of then up- and-coming star Michael Jordan. In 1991, NBC's first year with the NBA, the network got its dream matchup. Jordan's Bulls finally broke through, after several years of being dominated by the Pistons, and made it to the Finals. Jordan and the Bulls played Magic Johnson and the Lakers, who were making what was to be their last appearance in the NBA Finals for the next nine years. The hype for the star-studded series was robust, and the ratings were the highest since 1987, when the Celtics and Lakers played for the final time. The next year, Jordan's Bulls once again made the Finals. Their competition that year was the Portland Trail Blazers, a team with fewer stars and from a smaller city. The ratings fell to a 14.2, the second-lowest rating for the Finals since 1986. In 1993, the NBA hit a high point. The six-game series between the Bulls and the bombastic Charles Barkley's Phoenix Suns averaged a 17.9 rating, a mark that eclipsed the previous record of 15.9. ===1991=== Ernie Johnson Jr. has been TNT's NBA studio host since the 1990-1991 season. Currently, Johnson is joined by Kenny Smith, Charles Barkley, and Shaquille O'Neal. The NBA postgame show which features the four, Inside the NBA, has gained popularity in recent years for the chemistry and banter they have. Occasionally, Johnson, O'Neal, Smith and Barkley are joined by Chris Webber, Kevin McHale, David Aldridge, Reggie Miller or Isiah Thomas. NBC's coverage of the NBA began on Christmas Day each season, with the exception of the inaugural season in 1990 (which featured a game on November 3 between the Los Angeles Lakers and the San Antonio Spurs), the 1997–98 season (which included a preseason tournament featuring the Chicago Bulls), the 1998–99 season (as no Christmas games were played due to the 1998–99 NBA lockout), and the final season of the network's contract in 2001–02 (which included two early season games featuring the return of Michael Jordan with the Washington Wizards). NBC aired the NBA All- Star Game every year (with the exception of 1999, when the game was canceled due to the lockout), usually at 6:00 p.m., Eastern Time. The theme music for the NBA on NBC broadcasts, \\"Roundball Rock\\", was composed by new-age artist John Tesh. The instrumental piece, which NBC used for every telecast during the network's twelve-year tenure. Although Tesh offered the theme to ABC when it took over the rights to the league, the network declined. The pre-game show for NBC's NBA telecasts was NBA Showtime, a title that was used from 1990 until 2000, with the pre-game being unbranded afterward. Showtime was originally hosted by Bob Costas from the inaugural season of the 1990 contract to the 1995–96 season; Hannah Storm took over as host beginning with the 1996–97 season, who in turn was replaced by Ahmad Rashād in 2001 when Storm went on maternity leave. The video game NBA Showtime: NBA on NBC, by Midway Games, was named after the pregame show. NBC's first broadcast team of the 1990s–2000s era was made up of Marv Albert and Mike Fratello, with Ahmad Rashād serving as sideline reporter. Other broadcasters at the time included Dick Enberg and Steve \\"Snapper\\" Jones. Aside from Rashad, Jim Gray and Hannah Storm also handled sideline reporting duties; before becoming the television voice of the Spurs, Lakers and Pelicans, Joel Meyers also started as a sideline reporter for NBC. Bob Costas presided as host of the network's pre- game show, NBA Showtime. In 1991, \\"The Dream is Still Alive\\" by Wilson Phillips was played during the end of the season montage. *Game 1 of the 1991 Finals, played on Sunday afternoon (June 2), was the last time an NBA Finals game was played as a matinee. Since then, weekend games of the Finals (as well as midweek games) have been played in the evening to accommodate prime-time television. ===1992=== *1992 NBA Finals: Magic Johnson helped call Games 1, 4, and 5 for NBC. ===1993=== In 1992, basketball legend Earvin \\"Magic\\" Johnson became a top game analyst (alongside the likes of Enberg, Albert and Fratello); however, his performance was heavily criticized. Among the complaints were his apparently poor diction skills, his tendency for \\"stating the obvious\\", his habitual references to his playing days, and an overall lackluster chemistry with his broadcasting partners. Johnson would ultimately be slowly phased out of the NBA on NBC after helping commentate the 1993 NBA Finals. *1993 NBA Finals: Magic Johnson was unavailable for NBC's coverage of Game 6 (the series clincher) because he was attending his brother Larry's wedding. ===1994=== In 1994, Mike Fratello left the booth (in order to become the head coach of the Cleveland Cavaliers) and was replaced with Matt Guokas. Albert and Guokas broadcast the 1994 NBA Finals and were joined for the 1995 NBA Finals by Bill Walton. Albert, Guokas and Walton, while not working regular season games together (Walton usually worked games with Steve Jones and play-by-play announcers Dick Enberg, Tom Hammond or Greg Gumbel), broadcast the next two Finals (1996 and 1997) together in a three-man booth. *1994 NBA Finals: During Game 5 (June 17, 1994) most NBC affiliates (with the noted exception being WNBC-TV out of New York) split-screened coverage of the game with NFL Hall of Famer O. J. Simpson's low speed freeway chase with the LAPD. *The 1993 Finals were Michael Jordan's last before his first retirement. The Houston Rockets would take the next two titles consecutively. The ratings for those next two Finals decreased, but still had above-average views, and the 1995 Finals even came to within .3 ratings points of the 1992 Finals and featured Superstar Shaquille O'Neal making the Finals with the Orlando Magic, which were swept 4-0 by the Rockets. After the two seasons, Jordan returned. Subsequently, and almost instantly, ratings greatly increased. Jordan's first game back, a March 19, 1995 game between the Bulls and the Indiana Pacers, scored a 10.9 rating for NBC, the highest rated regular-season NBA game of all time. Ratings for the Finals (which the Bulls played in the following three years) went up sharply as well. Game 1 of the 1996 NBA Finals between the Bulls and Seattle SuperSonics, the Bulls' 107-90 win at home in the United Center earned a 16.8 rating and a 31 share on NBC. In addition, Game 1 was viewed in a then record 16,111,200 homes. On June 16, 1996, Game 6 of the NBA Finals (where the Bulls clinched their fourth NBA Championship in six years) drew an 18.8 rating and a 35 share. The six games of the 1996 NBA Finals averaged a 16.7 rating which ranks second all-time behind the 1993 NBA Finals. The six games of the 1993 NBA Finals between the Bulls and Suns averaged a 17.9 rating. The next year, ratings for the Bulls-Utah Jazz series were slightly better, before the 1998 Finals blew away the 1993 record, averaging an 18.7 rating--one which will likely not be matched by the NBA Finals for the foreseeable future. The deciding Game 6 (and Michael Jordan's final game with the Bulls) registered an NBA record 22.3 rating with a 38 share. The game was viewed by 72 million people, breaking the record set earlier that postseason by Game 7 of the 1998 Eastern Conference Finals between the Pacers and Bulls (that same game set a record for highest-rated non-Finals NBA game with a 19.1/33). The 1998 Finals managed to best the ratings for that year's World Series, the first of only three NBA Finals ever to do so. ===1995=== The original voice of the NBA on TNT was Bob Neal, who worked with the network from 1989 to 1995; he was also the original voice of the NBA on TBS. Other announcers who worked for TNT include Hubie Brown, Dick Stockton, Verne Lundquist, Chuck Daly, Danny Ainge, Reggie Theus, Rex Chapman, John Thompson, Jeff Van Gundy, P. J. Carlesimo, Gary Bender, Matt Devlin, Joel Meyers and Kevin Calabro. NBC's highest-rated regular season game was Michael Jordan's first game back from playing minor league baseball; the March 1995 game between the Chicago Bulls and Indiana Pacers scored a 10.9 rating (higher than all but three NBA telecasts on ABC). As a comparison, the first game in Jordan's second comeback (a game against the New York Knicks that aired on TBS opposite the 2001 World Series) scored a rating between a 3.0 and 4.0. NBC's first game of Jordan's second comeback scored ratings similar to that number. ===1997=== From 1997 to 2001, several contemporary music pieces were used for the montage (including, in 1997, R. Kelly's song \\"I Believe I Can Fly\\", which coincidentally came from a basketball film – Space Jam, which starred Michael Jordan and Pat Benatar's song \\"All Fired Up\\" from 1999 to 2001). *During the 1997 NBA Finals, Hannah Storm became the first woman to serve as pre-game host of the NBA Finals after serving as a sideline reporter for NBC in the past four years, but she wasn't the first female broadcaster to cover the NBA Finals (that honor goes to Lesley Visser). ===1998=== 1997 was the last time Marv Albert would call the NBA Finals for NBC during the decade, as an embarrassing sex scandal forced NBC to fire Albert before the start of the 1997–1998 season. To replace Albert, NBC tapped studio host Bob Costas for play-by-play. Matt Guokas did not return to his post as main color commentator, and was replaced by NBA legend Isiah Thomas; Costas was replaced on the pre-game show by Hannah Storm. Midway through the season, Costas and Thomas were joined by recently fired Detroit Pistons coach Doug Collins. Collins served to take some weight off Thomas, who was considered by some to be uncomfortable in the role of lead analyst. Thomas, in particular, was singled out for his soft voice and often stammered analysis. The team of Costas, Thomas and Collins worked the major games that season including the 1998 NBA Finals (which set an all-time ratings record for the NBA). Mike Breen, who played second fiddle to Albert on MSG Network's New York Knicks broadcasts, was hired to do select playoff games that year and was later promoted to backup announcer status. During its twelve-year run, the NBA on NBC experienced ratings highs and lows for the NBA. In the 1990s, the NBA Finals ratings were stellar, with the exception of 1999 Finals. In 1998, the NBA set a Finals ratings record, with an 18.7 household rating for the second Chicago Bulls–Utah Jazz series, the last championship run by the Michael Jordan-led Bulls. The very next year (after a lockout which erased part of the season), the ratings for the 1999 Finals plummeted, marking the beginning of an ongoing period of lower viewership for the league's game telecasts. *1998: The Finals between the Chicago Bulls and the Utah Jazz was the highest rated NBA Finals ever (18.7 percent rating over six games). Game 6 registered a 22.3 Nielsen rating with a 38 share and attracted 72 million viewers and became the highest rated game in the history of the NBA. The previous record was a 21.2 rating and 37 share for Game 7 of the 1988 NBA Finals between the Los Angeles Lakers and Detroit Pistons. ===1999=== For the 1998–99 season, Thomas was moved to the studio, while Costas and Collins made up the lead team. The 1998–1999 season, which was marred by a lengthy lockout (which resulted in the regular season being shortened to 50 games) included the low-rated 1999 NBA Finals between the San Antonio Spurs and the New York Knicks. Albert was brought back for the 1999–2000 season, making a return which included calling that year's lead Christmas Day game between the San Antonio Spurs and the Los Angeles Lakers from Staples Center. After the 1999 Finals, NBC used \\"Fly Away\\" by Lenny Kravitz for their montage. For the 1999-2000 NBA season, TBS shifted its primetime game telecasts from Wednesdays to Mondays. For the 2000-2001 NBA season, the broadcasts were moved to Tuesdays, while TNT assumed rights to Wednesday and Thursday evening games. *The retirement of Michael Jordan set in motion the decline in NBA ratings which continued for several years. Ratings for the 1999 NBA Finals (which in fairness, came after a lockout shortened season) were down significantly from the previous year, from an 18.7 to an 11.3. Primetime regular season games, which had become fairly routine (and highly rated) during the Jordan years, set record lows for NBC once Jordan retired. With the rise of the Los Angeles Lakers in the early part of the 2000s (decade), ratings improved, but never to the level of the 1980s or 1990s. The highest NBA Finals ratings on NBC after Jordan left was the 2001 Finals, which featured the dominant and then-defending champion Lakers with Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant versus the polarizing Allen Iverson and the underdog Philadelphia 76ers. The ratings for that series were a 12.1, still down 35 percent from 1998. NBC's last Finals, in 2002, came after a resurgence in playoff ratings (including a 14.2 rating for Game 7 of the Western Conference Finals). However, the Finals itself registered the lowest ratings the event had seen since 1981, topping out at a 10.2 average. ==See also== *List_of_NBA_Finals_broadcasters#1990s *List_of_NBA_All- Star_Game_broadcasters#1990s *List of NBA on NBC broadcasters *List of NBA on TNT commentators *NBA on television in the 1950s **NBA on television in the 1960s **NBA on television in the 1970s **NBA on television in the 1980s **NBA on television in the 2000s **NBA on television in the 2010s ==References== Category:CBS Sports Category:Turner Sports Category:Basketball on NBC Category:GMA Network Category:CTV Sports Category:1990s in American television ","title":"NBA on television in the 1990s"},{"id":"61397741","text":"The South Australian Railways Ge Class Locomotives were built by Beyer, Peacock and Company for the Glenelg Railway Company in 1897.

She was the oldest of three sisters and went on to attend art school in Cambridge, before taking on a deferment to join the Women's Royal Naval Service. When Watters was later recruited as one of around 10,000 women into the top- classified Ultra programme to decrypt the Enigma machine code at Bletchley Park in Buckinghamshire, a false story was created to say that she was a London bus driver to maintain secrecy of the project and she did not reveal any details of her work. She operated an Electromechanical machines known as a \\"bombe\\" to read signals transmitted by the German Armed Forces. Watters married United States Army Air Corps B-17 pilot John Watters at Saint Mary's Church, Westley soon after Victory in Europe Day and he received permission from the Government of the United Kingdom for his wife to leave the Navy to begin their life together. They had six children. Although the couple moved to the United States in 1969, Watters refused to take up citizenship, resisting pleas from her husband to do so. In the country, she took on the role of a housewife, creating birthday cards for her children by hand and painted. Her paintings were exhibited and she declined all offers from others to purchase her work. Watters also volunteered as a public school librarian and a tutor, regularly opening her home during the holiday period to help disadvantaged children in their education. Furthermore, she cooked on a broad culinary range and her recipes were sent across the world. Watters was a keen gardener and played contract bridge and mahjong to a high level. In 2009, her work in the Ultra programme was officially lifted and her work was recognised by Gordon Brown, the Prime Minister, with a medal for her contribution. Watters died on 15 September 2018 in Omaha, Nebraska. Her eldest son Robin insisted that she was buried with full British military honours at the Omaha National Cemetery on 24 September. Watters is immortalised in an interactive display in the United States Air Force hangar at the Imperial War Museum at Duxford. ==See also== * List of women in Bletchley Park * List of people associated with Bletchley Park ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:1925 births Category:2018 deaths Category:People from Bury St Edmunds Category:English expatriates in the United States Category:British cryptographers Category:Bletchley Park women Category:Women's Royal Naval Service officers Category:Women librarians ","title":"Jean Briggs Watters"},{"id":"61398230","text":"Brisbane Blaze is an Australian field hockey club based in Brisbane, Queensland.

The first of three numbered 25, 26 and 27 were all in service by June 1871. After being a well received class two more locomotives were ordered and were in service by October 1872, these were numbered 28 and 29. In August 1874 and two H class locomotives arrived numbered 30 and 31. The final two locomotives ordered for the SAR arrived in August 1877 and were numbered 2nd 2 and 2nd 3. These locomotives worked on the SAR system for many years with one member of the class being withdrawn as early as 1888. The rest of the class were rebuilt over the years and lasted well into the next century with the final locomotive being withdrawn by 1930. ==History== The first three of the newly designated H class were newly imported from England to work goods trains on the lightly laid line north of Roseworthy to Burra-Burra. After the H classes arrival on this north part of the line it relieved the smaller G class tank locomotives from this part and they were sent for duties elsewhere on the South Australian Railways. Proving to be a very successful class of locomotive a further set of purchases were made from the Robert Stephenson and Company in the years leading up to 1877. A total of nine locomotives of this class were in service by 1877 working on the Burra-Burra line hauling food and supplies from Adelaide and return with more products for the Burra-Burra mines. When the heavier R class 4-6-0 locomotives arrived in 1886 onwards work was found for the H class on other parts of the SAR system. This included hauling trains between Strathalbyn, Milang and Victor Harbor. Locomotive No. 25 was hired out by contractors for a short period of time to assist in constructing the Aldgate to Nairne line. Locomotive No. 2 was also hired out to assist with construction work on some of the Murraylands lines which also serviced the Mallee wheatlands. These lighter lines (including the Pinnaroo line) were eventually 'home' to the beloved H class locomotives in their later years of service on the SAR. Their useful lives on the SAR network came to an end with the inevitable suburban shunting duties and occasional passenger runs to the northern suburban stations. With the arrival of larger motive power for the SAR and even heavier trains being run, this in time resulted in the eventual demise of the H class 4-4-0's. By 1930 which was well into the new era of the South Australian Railways they were all scrapped. ==References== H Category:Broad gauge locomotives in Australia Category:Robert Stephenson and Company locomotives Category:4-4-0 locomotives Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1871 ","title":"South Australian Railways H class"},{"id":"61398398","text":"Eddie Higgins is an eponymous album by jazz pianist Eddie Higgins recorded in Chicago in 1960/61 and released by the Vee-Jay label.Gallagher, B.

She passes on the secret about the vessel and its power to Akshaya (Jyothika) and Masha (Revathi), who says she had buried the vessel due to fear that someone might steal it from her. She says that she has hidden it in Maanasthan's (Anandaraj) rice mill. Akshaya and Maasha get the help of Mottai (Rajendran) and Rahul Vijay (Yogi Babu). How they get their hands on the vessel while dealing with Maanasthan and Bhai (Mansoor Ali Khan) forms the crux of the story. == Cast == * Jyothika as Akshaya * Revathi as Mashavaani \\"Maasha\\" * Yogi Babu as Rahul Vijay * Anandaraj as Maanasthan and Inspector Maanasthi * Rajendran as Motta * Mansoor Ali Khan as Bhai * Sachu as Manimegalai * Manobala as Rice Mill Rayyappan * Mime Gopi as Rahul's father * Devadarshini as Rahul's mother * Jagan as Rahul's friend * Imman Annachi as Police Constable * Anthony Daasan as Pannaiyar * Suzane George as Jail Warden * Subhashini Kannan as Mrs. Maanasthan * Tiger Garden Thangadurai as Maanasthan's assistant * Vinu Krithik as Real Rahul * Redin Kingsley as Tumbler, Maanasthan's assistant * Veerasamar as worker at Maanasthan's house *Ashwin Raja as Maanasthan's assistant *Mahanadhi Shankar as Jail Warden * Sembaruthi Sanjay as Egg Seller * Supergood Subramani as Restaurant owner * Mippu as a member of Bhai's gang * Samuthirakani as Film Director (Special Appearance) == Soundtrack == The soundtrack of the film was composed by Vishal Chandrashekhar on lyrics of Vivek, Arunraja Kamaraj and Lady Kash. == Marketing == The first look poster of the film was unveiled on 30 April 2019. The official trailer of the film was released on 23 July 2019. The official audio launch was held on 27 July 2019. == Reception == Jackpot received negative reaction on its release Behindwoods stated that \\"Jyothika and Revathy charmingly playing to the gallery and Anandraj's comedies make Jackpot a one time watch\\" giving it a 2.2/5. While The Times of India giving three stars out of five, gave a positive review \\"Though the story has nothing new to offer except the plot surrounding the vessel, the film manages to entertain, thanks to some of the comic scenes which are devoid of double-entendre. The background score, however, reminds us of music from a few other movies. The two songs do not add much value to the story but look vibrant on the screen. An unapologetically made fun film, this may appeal to those who love watching movies in this genre.\\" Baradwaj Rangan of Film Companion South wrote \\"...the writing is all over the place and the director seems to have other concerns. He wants to project his heroine as a “mass” star. She gets to do slo-mo walks. She gets to beat up many men. She gets to mouth lines delivered on screen by other “mass” heroes. All this simply kills the mood\\". == References External links== * Category:2010s Tamil-language films Category:Indian films Category:2019 action comedy films Category:Indian action comedy films Category:Indian black comedy films Category:2010s heist films Category:Indian heist films Category:Films scored by Vishal Chandrasekhar Category:2019 comedy films Category:2019 films ","title":"Jackpot (2019 film)"},{"id":"61398494","text":"Judd Trump (pictured in 2015) won the 2019 World Snooker Championship defeating John Higgins 18–9 The year of 2019 included professional tournaments surrounding table-top cue sports.

NBC then succeeded the broadcast rights from 1990 to 2002. During NBC's partnership with the NBA in the 1990s, the league rose to unprecedented popularity, with ratings surpassing the days of Magic Johnson and Larry Bird in the mid 1980s. Upon expiration of the contract in 2002, the league signed an agreement with ABC, which began airing games in the 2002-03 season. NBC had made a four-year $1.3 billion ($330 million/year) bid in the spring of 2002 to renew its NBA rights, but the league instead went to ESPN and ABC with a six-year deal worth $2.4 billion ($400 million/year), a total of $4.6 billion ($766 million/year) when adding the cable deal with Turner Sports. Partially due to the retirement of Michael Jordan, the league suffered ratings decline after ESPN and ABC took over the rights. The NBA extended its national TV package on June 27, 2007 worth eight-year $7.4 billion ($930 million/year) through the 2015–16 season, during which the league had its new resurgence leading by renewed Celtics–Lakers rivalry and LeBron James. The 2001-02 season would mark the final year of regular NBA coverage on TBS, Turner Sports signed a new NBA television contract in which TNT would assume rights to the company's NBA package while TBS would discontinue game coverage altogether. ==Year-by-year summary2000=== For the 1999-2000 NBA season, TBS shifted its primetime game telecasts from Wednesdays to Mondays. For the 2000-2001 NBA season, the broadcasts were moved to Tuesdays, while TNT assumed rights to Wednesday and Thursday evening games. Starting in 2000, the NBA spread out telecasts of games from the Eastern Conference and Western Conference playoff series so that only two series would play on their scheduled game days (so as to avoid scheduling conflicts and ratings competition between TNT and TBS). TNT would air doubleheaders on most weekdays, while TBS would air one doubleheader each week. ===2001=== The pre- game show for NBC's NBA telecasts was NBA Showtime, a title that was used from 1990 until 2000, with the pre-game being unbranded afterward. Showtime was originally hosted by Bob Costas from the inaugural season of the 1990 contract to the 1995–96 season; Hannah Storm took over as host beginning with the 1996–97 season, who in turn was replaced by Ahmad Rashād in 2001 when Storm went on maternity leave. The video game NBA Showtime: NBA on NBC, by Midway Games, was named after the pregame show. During the NBA Finals, additional coverage would be immediately available on CNBC, in which the panelists provided an additional half-hour of in-depth game discussions, after the NBC broadcast network's coverage concluded. The 2000–2001 season brought to an end to Bob Costas' direct role with the NBA on NBC (although Costas would work playoff games for the next two seasons and would return to host NBC's coverage for the 2002 NBA Finals). Costas deferred to Marv Albert, allowing Albert to again be the lead broadcaster for the NBA, and stayed on only to deliver interviews and special features. On the studio front, Hannah Storm left her position as studio host to go on maternity leave, with Ahmad Rashād taking over for Storm; Isiah Thomas left NBC to become coach of the Indiana Pacers. Joining Ahmad Rashād were former Phoenix Suns player Kevin Johnson and former NBA coach P. J. Carlesimo. Marv Albert joined Doug Collins as the primary broadcast team, and the two broadcast the 2001 NBA Finals, which had the highest ratings for a Finals match since 1998. After the season, Collins was hired away from NBC by the Washington Wizards, which forced the network to move the longtime secondary color duo of Steve Jones and Bill Walton to the lead broadcast team with Albert. During the 2001 NBA Finals between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Philadelphia 76ers, NBC decided to cross-promote its NBA coverage with its then-popular quiz show The Weakest Link. Two 10-minute editions of The Weakest Link aired during halftime of Games 2 and 3, featuring Bob Costas, Bill Walton and Steve Jones as contestants, along with Charlotte Hornets guard Baron Davis and WNBA team Los Angeles Sparks's center, Lisa Leslie. In late 2001, the NBA was in the midst of putting together a new broadcast and cable television deal. At the time, conventional wisdom was that NBC would renew its existing broadcasting contract with the league. An October 5, 2001, Sports Business Daily article cited The New York Times sports columnist Richard Sandomir regarding the possibility of ESPN joining with ABC in obtaining a portion of the contract: The negotiations were closely watched by those in the business world, as it was the first time that a major sports league crafted a television deal in the new economic environment since the September 11 terrorist attacks a few months before. Declining ratings for NBC's NBA game telecasts had already led many to believe that the NBA's next television rights fee would be lower than previous years, and the economic recession made that a likely scenario. As predicted, NBC's offer to the league was lower than the previous agreement's amount. Had the NBA agreed to the network's offer, it would have been the first sports league to experience a decline in rights fees. However, the NBA rejected NBC's offer and after the network's exclusive negotiating period with the league expired, ABC and ESPN stepped in. On January 22, 2002, the NBA signed a six-year deal with The Walt Disney Company and Turner Sports, which renewed an existing deal with TNT and allowed ABC and ESPN to acquire the rights to air the league's games. ABC and ESPN reportedly paid an average of about US$400 million a season. Technically, ESPN pays the NBA for its broadcast rights and \\"buys\\" time on ABC to air select games (this is noted in copyright tags during the end credits at the conclusion of the telecasts, saying \\"The preceding program has been paid for by ESPN, Inc.\\") In all, the contract allowed the NBA to increase its rights fees by 25%. *2001 NBA Finals: NBC studio host Hannah Storm did not anchor the NBA Finals due to her being on maternity leave, so Ahmad Rashad replaced her. She returned to cover the NBA Finals in 2002, but as post-game host. ===2002=== NBC's halftime show was sponsored by Prudential Financial (Prudential Halftime Report), and later NetZero (NetZero at the Half) and Verizon Wireless (Verizon Wireless at the Half). The broadcasts also featured a segment during the live games called Miller Genuine Moments, which provided a brief retrospective on a particular historically significant and/or dramatic moment in NBA history; this segment was discontinued towards the end of NBC's coverage. For a brief period in 2001–02, NBC aired a studio segment called 24, in which each analyst (at that time, Pat Croce, Jayson Williams or Mike Fratello) would have 24 seconds to talk about issues concerning the NBA. NBC (in conjunction with completely revamping the pregame show) discontinued the segment in February 2002, after Williams was arrested on murder charges. The 2001-2002 season would ultimately mark TBS's final year of NBA coverage. Turner Sports signed a new NBA television contract in which TNT would assume rights to the company's NBA package, while TBS would discontinue game coverage altogether; ESPN assumed TBS's half of the league's cable television rights. During 2002, TBS aired doubleheaders every Tuesday night of the playoffs until the Conference Finals. The final NBA game ever to be regularly televised on TBS aired on May 13, 2002, when the San Antonio Spurs faced the Los Angeles Lakers in Game 5 of the Western Semifinals. In that last game, Robert Horry hit a key three-pointer that won the series four games to one for the Lakers to move on to the Western Conference Finals. The 2001–2002 season featured several anomalies, as NBC started their coverage on the first Saturday of the season, for the first time since 1991. The reason for this was NBA legend Michael Jordan's return to playing, this time for the Washington Wizards. NBC covered an early December game featuring Jordan's Wizards as well, which marked the first time a broadcast television network aired more than one pre- Christmas NBA game since CBS in the 1980s. That year also marked the return of Hannah Storm from maternity leave, with her and Ahmad Rashād alternating as studio hosts throughout the 2002 season. That year, NBC's studio team consisted of Rashad and Storm with former Philadelphia 76ers owner Pat Croce, the returning Mike Fratello, and former player Jayson Williams. The tandem stayed together through the 2002 NBA All-Star Game. During the week between the All-Star Game and NBC's next scheduled telecast, Williams was arrested after shooting and killing his limousine driver. He was promptly fired by NBC, which also did not return Croce or Fratello to studio coverage. Instead, the network brought in Tom Tolbert, who had only recently been added to NBC Sports as a third-string analyst paired with Mike Breen. Tolbert stayed on as the lone studio analyst through the end of the season, and won acclaim by several in the media, including USA Today sports columnist Rudy Martzke. Hannah Storm was not able to anchor the 2002 NBA All-Star Game as she was on assignment at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City serving as daytime studio host; Rashad solo anchored from the studio. Two days before NBC was to begin its playoff coverage, both Marv Albert and Mike Fratello, returning from working a Philadelphia 76ers–Indiana Pacers game on TNT, were seriously injured in a limousine accident. That week, NBC juggled its announcing teams, which resulted in Bob Costas and Paul Sunderland working some early-round playoff games. Fratello would return to TNT after several days, and Albert returned to NBC for Game 1 of the Western Conference Semifinals between the Dallas Mavericks and Sacramento Kings. The season would also turn out to be NBC's last with the NBA. As previously mentioned, in January 2002, the league announced a six-year agreement with The Walt Disney Company and AOL Time Warner, which resulted in the broadcast television rights being acquired by ABC. That year, NBC's playoff ratings were much higher than in previous years, including tallying record-high ratings for the 2002 Western Conference Finals. Those high ratings did not translate to the Finals, which scored their lowest ratings in over two decades. In 2002, NBC set a record for the highest-rated Western Conference Final, including a 14.2 rating for Game 7 of the series between the Los Angeles Lakers and Sacramento Kings. The NBA moves from NBC to ABC Upon the expiration of NBC Sports' contract with the NBA in 2002, the league signed a broadcast television rights agreement with ABC, which began airing games in the 2002–03 season. NBC had made a four-year, US $1.3 billion bid in the spring of 2002 to renew its NBA rights, but the league instead made six-year deals worth $4 billion with ESPN, ABC and TNT. Simply put, NBC could not compete with the combined broadcast and cable deal that Disney had with ESPN and ABC. To put things into proper perspective, when NBC's relationship with the NBA ended in 2002, their only cable properties were CNBC and MSNBC. The major leagues receive more money from cable than broadcast, due to the duel revenue stream of subscriptions and ad revenue. It took a decade for NBC to have a strong cable portfolio, which now includes USA, E!, SyFy, and NBC Sports Network, amongst other channels. Another thing to keep in mind is the fact that NBC lost $35 million because of the failure of the XFL. As Charles Barkley summed it up during halftime of Game 1 of the 2002 NBA Finals \\"If y'all hadn't wasted all that money on the XFL, y'all would still have basketball.\\" Whereas NBC normally televised 33 regular games per year, ABC would generally air fewer than 20 regular season games annually. According to NBA Commissioner David Stern, the reduced number of network telecasts was at the league's own request since the NBA believed that they would get a higher audience for a single game (in contrast to NBC's tripleheaders). From 2002 to 2006, the NBA's ratings on broadcast television (ABC) dropped almost a full ratings point (from nearly a 3.0 average rating to just above a 2.0 rating). NBC averaged a 5.5 average rating during the 2002 NBA Playoffs. ABC averaged a 3.3 average rating for the 2005 NBA Playoffs. In response to the impending loss of NBA coverage, NBC Entertainment president Jeff Zucker said: Within two years of the network losing the NBA rights, NBC dropped to fourth place in the prime time television rankings for the first time in its history, which was also partly the result of a weaker prime time schedule, and would more or less remain there until for almost nine years. NBC Sports chairman Dick Ebersol said: Ebersol added: In a down economy, after losing $100 million on the NBA in 2000-2001, NBC was projecting a $200-million loss in 2001-2002. The NBA also saw its NBC ratings for the regular season fall from 4.3 in 1999 to 3.0 in 2000. Meanwhile, and the playoff ratings dipped from 6.5 to 4.9. NBC network president Randy Falco said: NBC's last NBA telecast to date was Game 4 of the 2002 NBA Finals, which closed with highlights from the network's 12-year run with the league, through the Chicago Bulls' dynasty led by Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen, the retirement of Larry Bird and Magic Johnson and the Los Angeles Lakers' new Shaq/Kobe reign. The final image of the end montage was set in an empty gym, showing a basketball bouncing into the background and ending with the message, \\"Thanks for The Memories.\\" Prior to the sequence, match commentators Marv Albert, Steve Jones and Bill Walton evaluated the end of their NBA contract and of the series. After that, Bob Costas closed the network's last NBA broadcast with the following: In 2002, after NBC's final broadcast, the network aired a montage of memorable moments from every year of coverage, using music from \\"Titans Spirit\\" (from the film Remember the Titans) to \\"Winning It All\\" and most notably, \\"To The Flemish Cap\\" from the 2000 film The Perfect Storm. The song composed by James Horner is played at the beginning of the montage as well as the end featuring footage from the Los Angeles Lakers dynasty era. This theme song has made a brief comeback as part of NBC's Olympic basketball coverage in 2008, and again in 2016. In December 2018, Fox Sports acquired the rights to \\"Roundball Rock\\" for use during college basketball games. *During the 2002 NBA Finals, Ahmad Rashad had told The Los Angeles Times before the 2002 NBA Finals began that he would be ending his 20-year run on NBC Sports with Game 3 of the NBA Finals on the pregame show. A feature in which he interviewed Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Byrant would be his last assignment for the network. He and Hannah Storm were replaced by Bob Costas as host of the pregame show for the Finals, and Rashad declined to join Hannah Storm on the post-game show carried by CNBC. ===2003=== After obtaining the NBA broadcast rights, ABC courted two main announcers from the NBA on NBC, Bob Costas and Marv Albert. After Costas (who was reportedly offered a generous deal which also included offers to do play-by-play for ESPN's Major League Baseball telecasts and feature reports for ABC News) elected to remain with NBC, and Albert signed a six-year deal with TNT, the network went with veteran broadcaster Brad Nessler to be the lead play-by-play announcer for its NBA broadcasts. Nessler, who prior to that point had not been the main voice for any professional sport on television, received a call from Marv Albert's agent, soon after getting the job. On the call, Nessler said in an interview with the Internet Movie Database: Nessler was initially joined on the broadcasts by color commentator Bill Walton and lead sideline reporter Michele Tafoya. The team of Nessler and Walton did two broadcasts together before ABC decided that Walton needed a partner (much like he had at NBC with Steve Jones) and assigned pre-game analyst Tom Tolbert to join the team. Nessler, Walton and Tolbert called most regular season games, and every network playoff game. Other games were called by the team of Brent Musburger and Sean Elliott. After suffering the worst ratings in NBA Finals history for the 2003 series, low ratings overall, and harsh criticism, ABC decided to retool the team. More to the point, during this particular period, Brad Nessler was accused by media analysts (among them, New York Times columnist Richard Sandomir) of not knowing game strategy well, lacking rhythm and enthusiasm in his game call, not bringing out the best in his partners, too often ignoring the score and his tendency to stammer. Nessler and Walton worked NBA Wednesday games most weeks during the 2002–03 season. For NBA Friday, Mike Tirico and Tom Tolbert worked late night West Coast games while John Saunders and Sean Elliott did the early games. For the playoffs, ESPN added Jim Durham to its list of television play-by-play voices and used the ABC main team of Nessler, Walton and Tolbert for its coverage of the 2003 Eastern Conference Finals. This was also the only year that ABC broadcast both the NBA and the Stanley Cup Finals involving teams from one market in the same year, as both the New Jersey Nets and the New Jersey Devils were in their respective league's finals. During ABC's broadcast of Game 3 between the San Antonio Spurs and the Nets in New Jersey on June 8, Nessler, Tolbert and Walton said that ABC was in a unique situation getting ready for both that game and Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals between the Devils and the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim the following night. Gary Thorne, Bill Clement and John Davidson mentioned this the following night, and thanked Nessler, Tolbert and Walton for promoting ABC's broadcast of Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals. In its first year of coverage, ABC used the same graphics package as partner network ESPN, with the \\"score bug\\" being the only difference between the two networks' packages. This habit had already been put into practice by the network in regards to its NHL and college basketball coverage. However, ABC did utilize its own graphics (though they were similar in resemblance to ESPN's at the time) for college football and other sports broadcasts. For the 2003–04 season, ABC established new graphics for its NBA broadcasts, in an effort to differentiate its telecasts from ESPN's. On February 5, 2006, ABC established another new graphics package, including a horizontal scoreboard (similar to that introduced the previous fall for its final season of Monday Night Football) for the network's NBA telecasts. With the advent of the new NBA television deal in 2003 (which ended TBS's coverage), TNT has aired playoff games alone, including (in 2003 only) some weekday tripleheaders. The tripleheaders, which were criticized by both fans and many in the media, consisted of one game at 6:00 p.m., another at 8:30 p.m., and a final game at 11:00 p.m. After 2003, the NBA and TNT discontinued the tripleheaders, instead settling for a doubleheader on TNT and a single game on NBA TV simultaneously. However, when Turner Sports acquired NBA TV in 2008, the network abandoned airing the lone non-national Thursday game, instead leaving it up to the local sports networks. However, TBS may still air the start of the second game in case the ongoing first game on TNT extends beyond the tip-off time of the second game. On isolated occasions (typically during the playoffs) since TNT assumed partial cable rights to the NBA, TBS has served as an overflow feed for certain games. In 2003, TBS aired a doubleheader of first round Game 6 matchups (the Indiana Pacers-Boston Celtics and San Antonio Spurs-Phoenix Suns series). One common complaint about NBA coverage on ABC is the use of unconventional camera angles, including the Floorcam and Skycam angles, used by the network throughout its coverage. Other complaints are of camera angles that appear too far away, colors that seem faded and dull, and the quieting of crowd noise so that announcers can be heard clearly (by contrast to NBC, which allowed crowd noise to sometimes drown out their announcers). Some complaints have concerned the promotion, or perceived lack thereof, of NBA telecasts. The 2003 NBA Finals received very little fanfare on ABC or corporate partner ESPN; while subsequent Finals were promoted more on both networks, NBA-related advertisements on ABC were still down significantly from promotions on NBC. NBA promos took up 3 minutes and 55 seconds of airtime on ABC during the week of May 23, 2004 according to the Sports Business Daily, comparable to 2 minutes and 45 seconds for the Indianapolis 500. Promotions for the Indianapolis 500 outnumbered promotions for the NBA Finals fourteen-to-nine between the hours of 9:00 and 11:00 p.m. during that week. *The 2003 NBA All-Star Game on TNT marked the first time that the game was broadcast by a cable television network. TNT airs many of the NBA's marquee games (the NBA All-Star Game, a full Conference Final (alternating between the Western Conference in even-numbered years and the Eastern conference in odd-numbered years), Opening Night games, and the vast majority of playoff games). In recent years, fans have reckoned it as what NBC was during that network's coverage of the league. TNT would seem to be the NBA's preferred carrier as well; from 2003 to 2005, TNT aired the Conference Final with the most interest from the national media (Spurs-Mavericks in 2003, Lakers-Wolves in 2004 and Pistons-Heat in 2005). TNT also airs most of the big games during the regular season (TNT aired a Lakers-Heat game for the third straight year in 2007), and TNT studio content is streamed to NBA.com via the TNT Overtime section. *2003 NBA Finals: The series between the San Antonio Spurs and the New Jersey Nets was the lowest rated NBA Final (6.5 percent over six games) until 2007. This was also the only year that ABC broadcast both the NBA and the Stanley Cup Finals that involved teams from one city in the same year, as both the New Jersey Nets and the New Jersey Devils were in their respective league's finals. During ABC's broadcast of Game 3 between the San Antonio Spurs and the Nets in New Jersey on June 8, Brad Nessler, Tom Tolbert, and Bill Walton said that ABC was in a unique situation getting ready for both that game and Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals between the Devils and the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim the following night, also at Continental Airlines Arena. Gary Thorne, Bill Clement, and John Davidson mentioned this the following night and thanked Nessler, Tolbert, and Walton for promoting ABC's broadcast of Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals. ===2004=== After low ratings on ABC and for the Conference Finals, ESPN reshuffled its announcing group. With the addition of Al Michaels to the ABC NBA line-up. ESPN dissolved the Nessler-Tolbert-Walton team, keeping Nessler as the main announcer but pairing him with Sean Elliott and Dan Majerle. Walton was demoted significantly, working games sporadically (including most of the ESPN NBA Sunday games with either Jim Durham or Brent Musburger). Tolbert stayed with Mike Tirico in a new three-man booth that also included newcomer George Karl. Also added to the ESPN line-up was Mike Breen, who became the number three announcer behind Tirico and Nessler. Breen worked most of his games with Bill Walton. Doc Rivers, a critically acclaimed analyst when he worked with Turner Sports for TNT's NBA broadcasts, became available after a 1–10 start by his Orlando Magic led to his firing as the team's coach. Rivers was hired weeks before ABC's Christmas Day season opener. He and Michaels worked that game together, one of only six they did together during the regular season (all other games Rivers worked were with Brad Nessler). During the playoffs, Michaels and Rivers worked every single telecast, including the 2004 NBA Finals, which saw significant ratings improvement. During the 2004 NBA Playoffs, Doc Rivers was hired as head coach of the Boston Celtics. Though Rivers continued to work games with Al Michaels throughout the rest of the playoffs, ABC was forced to search for a new lead analyst for the 2004–05 season. In addition, the network dropped Brad Nessler from all NBA coverage, and did not retain Sean Elliott or Dan Majerle. For the 2004 Eastern Conference Final, ESPN used Nessler along with ABC's lead analyst Doc Rivers for every game of the series. Game 6 between Detroit and Indiana was the last NBA game Nessler has called to date. Each season, ABC begins its NBA coverage with a Christmas Day doubleheader (with the exception of 2004 and 2006, when the network broadcast only one game). From 2004 to 2006, ABC insisted on carrying a Christmas game between the Miami Heat and the Los Angeles Lakers. Since 2009, ABC's Christmas Day doubleheader has featured a music video featuring Mariah Carey performing her hit 1994 single \\"All I Want for Christmas Is You.\\" In 2010, Carey was featured singing \\"Oh Santa!\\" Following the initial Christmas game telecasts, Sunday afternoon coverage of regular season games begins in mid-January or early February. The number of Sunday afternoon regular season games that ABC normally covers is significantly lower than what NBC broadcast during its tenure with the league. In its first season of coverage, ABC aired 14 regular- season games, in comparison to NBC's yearly average of 33 games. That number increased to 18 games in the next two seasons ( and ), and 20 games in the season. For , ABC decreased the number of game telecasts it aired during the season to 19. In a 2002 interview with Jim Rome, NBA commissioner David Stern commented about the number of league games broadcast on ABC: By contrast to Stern's assessment, media analysts and many fans found that the cable-heavy television deal made many games unavailable and, in addition, devalued the league. Starting with the second round of the playoffs, TNT's NBA coverage becomes exclusive, meaning that no locally produced league broadcasts can compete against the TNT telecasts (though commensurate with the move to sports rights to cable, few over-the-air local stations currently carry NBA coverage). Because of this, fans of teams in the playoffs who do not have a cable television subscription are unable to watch most playoff games. In addition, ABC's coverage is always exclusive, including during the regular season. If an ongoing game airs opposite one televised by ABC, it cannot be televised in the local market, which has the side effect of causing some games to not be aired on television at all. Sports Business Daily quoted Houston Chronicle writer Jonathan Feigen regarding the structuring of the NBA's deal with ABC: ===2005=== Brad Nessler was dropped from ESPN/ABC's NBA coverage altogether starting with the 2004-05 NBA season. Mike Breen was promoted to lead announcer for ESPN, continuing to work games with Bill Walton (including the Pacers–Pistons brawl). Sean Elliott was dropped, along with Dan Majerle, Doc Rivers (who had become coach of the Boston Celtics) and George Karl (who left during the season to coach the Denver Nuggets). Jim Durham's role increased and ESPN hired former NBC analyst Steve Jones (Durham and Jones would work several regular season games together). ESPN did not use Jones and former cohort Bill Walton in games together during the regular season. Tom Tolbert's role decreased significantly; he was reduced primarily to West Coast games. In the playoffs, ESPN used the team of Mike Breen and Bill Walton for its coverage of the 2005 Western Conference Final. Al Michaels partnered with newly added Hubie Brown for the NBA Finals on ABC. Outside of the Conference Finals, ABC generally airs playoff games throughout the first five weeks of the NBA Playoffs, in addition to a number of special prime-time playoff games, usually televised on Thursday or Saturday nights. In 2005, ABC aired the first non-cable Memorial Day game in three years, when the Phoenix Suns and San Antonio Spurs battled in Game 4 of the Western Conference Finals. Prior to the most recent NBA television deal, Memorial Day playoff games had become a yearly tradition on network television. Unlike previous broadcast partners, ABC has never aired a non-Christmas regular season game after 3:30 p.m. Eastern Time. While NBC had several 5:30 p.m. Eastern start times for games, ABC has only gone beyond that time on Christmas, and for select playoff games, including the Finals. On March 20, 2005, ABC aired a pair of games regionally (between the San Antonio Spurs and Detroit Pistons, and the Phoenix Suns and Memphis Grizzlies) at 3:30 p.m. Eastern Time. After the Spurs–Pistons game ended, the network opted to end coverage for its stations to carry regularly scheduled local programming instead of switching over to the Suns–Grizzlies game (in which the Suns were up 94–91 late in the fourth quarter). NBC rarely committed this practice, as it instead showed the tail end of a game still in progress after the previous game has completed. Early in the 2004–2005 season, Memphis Grizzlies coach Hubie Brown, a broadcasting legend with CBS, TBS and TNT, was forced into retirement due to health issues and was soon after hired to replace Doc Rivers as Al Michaels' broadcast booth partner. Brown called his first ABC game with Michaels on Christmas Day 2004, working the highly anticipated a Heat-Lakers game pitting those team's respective star players Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant. After that game, the two did not do a game together again until March 2005. Michaels began covering NBA games sporadically, doing two games in early March and three additional games in April. Meanwhile, Brown worked every week of ABC's coverage, broadcasting some games with veteran broadcaster Mike Breen. Michele Tafoya served as lead sideline reporter for all of the network's game broadcasts. In addition to Hubie Brown, ABC added other known analysts to its NBA coverage. Jim Durham and Dr. Jack Ramsay both worked several games during the regular season, while Brent Musburger, John Saunders, Len Elmore and Mark Jackson were involved with others. Breen and Ramsay were the first secondary broadcast team to work a playoff game for ABC. Breen called three playoff games for the network in 2005, the most notable being Game 1 of the Western Conference Finals with Hubie Brown. Al Michaels was criticized by the New York Post for not broadcasting the game and seeming uninterested in the NBA in general. Barry Horn of The Dallas Morning News said that Michaels was simply \\"not a basketball guy\\". Meanwhile, Bill Simmons said during the 2005 Finals that Michaels \\"shows up for these games, does his job, then drives home thinking, ‘Only five weeks to the [NFL] Hall of Fame Game, I'm almost there!’\\" Another criticism that Michaels received was that he too often found himself making tediously long-winded explanations. In return, he would tend to talk over two or three possessions in a row (which Michaels seemed to be better suited for football and baseball broadcasts, for which he's better known for). The end result was that he would hardly have time to comment on the action viewers were seeing because he was so hung up on a prior subplot or storyline that he felt the audience just had to know about. Michaels was also accused of apparently lacking the kind of enthusiasm and confidence (for instance, Michaels initially reacted to Amar'e Stoudemire's block of Tim Duncan's shot during the 2005 playoffs by calling it a \\"great, great contested shot\\") expected of a main play-by-play voice. Michaels, who by the end of his tenure on the NBA on ABC only called a total of 37 NBA games overall with ABC (a combined thirteen regular season games), did return for the NBA Finals, which scored its second-lowest rating of all time (despite the fact that it was the first Finals in eleven years to go to a seventh game). From March 7, 2004 to April 17, 2005 – including playoff games – each game Michaels called involved either the Los Angeles Lakers (whose home city Michaels resides when not broadcasting sports events) or Sacramento Kings, a total of 21 consecutive games. Game 7 of the 2005 NBA Finals would end up being Michaels' last with the NBA on ABC. ===2006=== ESPN's announcing teams remained stable in the 2005-06 NBA season. Mike Breen and Bill Walton worked games together during the first half of the season; after Breen was promoted to lead broadcaster for ABC (due to Al Michaels defecting to NBC), Mike Tirico became the number two broadcaster and worked several games with Walton (and later, Steve Jones). During the 2006 NBA Playoffs, Breen worked games with ABC partner Hubie Brown, including the 2006 Eastern Conference Final. On May 22, 2006, due to Game 7 of the San Antonio Spurs-Dallas Mavericks series going into overtime, TBS aired part of the Game 7 Western Conference playoff match between the Los Angeles Clippers and Phoenix Suns. On May 14, 2004, the same situation arose, as Game 5 of the New Jersey Nets-Detroit Pistons playoff series lasted three overtimes. However, due to scheduling conflicts with TBS, TNT had to air part of the Sacramento Kings-Minnesota Timberwolves game that was supposed to follow on NBA TV. The first few minutes of Game 4 of the 2007 Western Conference Semifinal between the Phoenix Suns and San Antonio Spurs were shown on TBS, due to the game between the Cleveland Cavaliers and the New Jersey Nets running past the former's 9:30 p.m. Eastern start time. The above situations are not unlike those that have been encountered during TBS telecasts of Major League Baseball Division Series games since 2007; at times, due to certain games running over their scheduled end time, TNT has had to air the first few minutes of games that TBS is supposed to cover. In 2006, after ABC Sports became ESPN on ABC the NBA on ABC started to be produced by ESPN with ESPN graphics. All broadcasts have an \\"on ABC\\" suffix on their titles after this rebrand. ESPN, along with partner network ABC, began using graphics packages inherited by ESPN's Monday Night Football broadcast starting in 2006, featuring a score banner with an oblique red and white design. The graphics were later replaced in April 2009 with a more compact grey design, with panel- like lower thirds and a permanent \\"stats bar\\" located underneath the score and time. This was replaced in 2010 with an updated appearance based on another redesign adopted by Monday Night Football in late 2009, featuring a more metallic appearance that would later be adopted by other ESPN properties, along with the addition of yellow lights beneath a team's name to indicate remaining timeouts. At the start of the 2011–12 season, an updated version of the design was adopted with a more translucent appearance, and the addition of a \\"BONUS\\" indicator under a team's score if they have reached enough fouls to initiate the Bonus situation. Starting with the 2013 Western Conference Finals, a newly designed banner featuring 3-dimensional renditions of the team logos were used. During the 2015 NBA Finals, the graphics were updated with gold coloring, patterned backgrounds, and a modern, unified font. At the start of the 2015-16 season however, ESPN reverted to the banner used since 2013. On May 17, 2016, the aforementioned updated graphics package from the previous year's NBA Finals returned for the 2016 Eastern Conference Finals and again for the 2016 NBA Finals. *2006 NBA Finals: Lisa Salters was the main sideline reporter alongside Stuart Scott with Michele Tafoya on maternity leave. She was the main ABC sideline reporter for that season before sliding back to secondary reporter with Tafoya's return. ===2007=== For the 2006-07 NBA season, Hubie Brown moved to ESPN full-time as the lead color commentator, paired with Mike Breen. Mike Tirico and Bill Walton remained as the number two team, with Steve Jones being replaced by newcomer Jon Barry. Tom Tolbert remained in his reduced role, in a broadcast team with either Mark Jones or ESPN WNBA play-by-play man Dave Pasch. John Saunders, with former NBA Shootaround colleagues Greg Anthony and Tim Legler worked Sunday night games televised by ESPN, as they had in the previous season. Fred Hickman became the primary studio host, working with a rotating team of analysts. Additions included Jamal Mashburn and Allan Houston. ESPN increased its number of female analysts, adding current WNBA players Becky Hammon and Kara Lawson as sideline reporters. Swin Cash, of the Detroit Shock, was added as a studio analyst, debuting on NBA Shootaround early in the season. Doris Burke continued as a sideline reporter, while Lisa Salters (who had added Saturday Night Football to her duties) cut down on working NBA Friday games. On January 12, 2007, Kara Lawson was the analyst alongside play-by-play man Mark Jones for ESPN's Washington Wizards-New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets game. During this season, ABC's coverage of the NBA was fully integrated in ESPN. In June 2007, and again in October 2014, the NBA renewed its television agreement with ESPN, as well as TNT, with the current contract extending through the 2024-25 season. On July 9, 2007, it was announced by Dan Patrick that he would be leaving ESPN after 18 years with the network. Stuart Scott hosted ABC's pregame show for the 2007–08 season along with analysts Bill Walton and Michael Wilbon. Jeff Van Gundy also joined Mike Breen and Mark Jackson full-time, starting Christmas Day. After Walton had back problems in February, Jon Barry replaced him for the rest of the season. For the 2006–07 NBA season, ABC's sports operations were fully integrated into ESPN (rebranding the sports division as ESPN on ABC). As a result, Mark Jackson replaced Hubie Brown as ABC's lead analyst (Brown would still pair with Mike Breen on ESPN's primary broadcast team and Mike Tirico on ABC's secondary team). ABC's pre-game show, which Jackson was a part of, also began to be broadcast from the site of the main game each week (much as was the case during first season of the network's current NBA deal in 2003). Additionally, Michele Tafoya returned as a sideline reporter, after sitting out the 2005-06 season on maternity leave. Lisa Salters returned to her role as its secondary sideline reporter the following year as Tafoya returned to her old role. *Although the 2007 NBA Finals aired on ABC (as had been the case since 2003), they were the first to carry the \\"ESPN on ABC\\" branding instead of the ABC Sports branding. **The Finals between the San Antonio Spurs and the Cleveland Cavaliers was the lowest rated NBA Finals ever (6.2 percent rating over four games). **Since 2007, NBA ratings have steadily risen, thanks to the resurgence of nationally recognized NBA teams, their star power, and their annual presence in the NBA Finals. Game 7 of the 2010 NBA Finals had the best rating for a basketball game in the contemporary NBA on ABC era, and the 2011 Finals held steady in the ratings department as well. Both series drew over a 10 rating, beating the World Series in consecutive years for the first time ever. ===2008=== ABC was also criticized for focusing its coverage on a select number of teams, particularly the decision to broadcast a Lakers-Heat game on its Christmas Day schedule for three consecutive years. However, for 2007, ABC decided to break this tradition by instead having the Heat, for the fourth straight time, appear on Christmas Day facing the 2007 Eastern Conference Champions, the Cleveland Cavaliers. In 2008, the Boston Celtics replaced the Heat on the Christmas Day schedule, and faced the Los Angeles Lakers; and in 2009, the Cavaliers played the Lakers on Christmas Day. However, the Heat-Lakers Christmas Day special would make its return in the 2010–11 NBA season, as a result of LeBron James' recent move from the Cleveland franchise to Miami. For the 2011–12 NBA season, the Lakers and Heat played again on Christmas Day, but against separate opponents. The Lakers played the Chicago Bulls, while the Heat played the Dallas Mavericks in a rematch of the 2011 NBA Finals; both the Bulls and Mavericks made their ABC Christmas Day debuts, which also acted as the league's opening day that season due to the 2011 NBA lockout delaying the start of the season. In the case of the latter, ABC aired the pre-game championship ring and banner ceremony for the Mavericks, which marked the first time in NBA history a national broadcast network televised the ceremony. In the 2007–08 season, Jeff Van Gundy joined ESPN's coverage, pairing with Mike Breen on the lead broadcast team. Mike Tirico and Hubie Brown, who worked ABC games together last season, formed the number two team, with Dan Shulman replacing Tirico when he had Monday Night Football commitments. Bill Walton became ESPN's lead studio analyst, along with Stuart Scott and Stephen A. Smith. Mark Jones also hosted NBA Shootaround, and occasionally paired with Jon Barry as the third team, replacing Shulman. Tom Tolbert, who called the NBA Finals for ABC just 4 years earlier, was dropped, along with reporter Jim Gray. Rick Carlisle and Jalen Rose also were added, giving analysis on Sportscenter and occasionally appearing on NBA Shootaround. On December 31, 2007 analyst Kiki Vandeweghe left ESPN to pursue a role with the New Jersey Nets.http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=3174881 Vandeweghe takes key personnel role with Nets Michele Tafoya left her role as NBA sideline reporter for ABC after the 2007-08 season to spend more time with her family, however she continued to work for ESPN, primarily serving as a sideline reporter for Monday Night Football (before leaving for NBC in 2011 to serve that same position for Sunday Night Football). Doris Burke, who already served as an analyst for ESPN's NBA telecasts, replaced Tafoya as lead sideline reporter on the ABC broadcasts. ===2009=== In 2008, TNT broadcast on Christmas Day for the first time as Marv Albert, Mike Fratello and Craig Sager broadcast the game between the Washington Wizards and the Cleveland Cavaliers in Quicken Loans Arena and Kevin Harlan, Reggie Miller and Cheryl Miller broadcast the game between the Dallas Mavericks and the Portland Trail Blazers in Rose Garden. ==ReferencesSee also== *List of NBA on ABC commentators *List of NBA on ESPN broadcasters *List of NBA on NBC broadcasters *List of NBA on TNT commentators *NBA on television in the 1950s **NBA on television in the 1960s **NBA on television in the 1970s **NBA on television in the 1980s **NBA on television in the 1990s **NBA on television in the 2010s *List_of_NBA_Finals_broadcasters#2000s *List_of_NBA_All- Star_Game_broadcasters#2000s Category:Basketball on NBC Category:ABC Sports Category:ESPN Category:Turner Sports Category:Solar Entertainment Corporation Category:CTV Sports Category:2000s in American television ","title":"NBA on television in the 2000s"},{"id":"61398700","text":"The Verdict - State vs Nanavati is an 2019 Indian Hindi drama mystery web series created by Ekta Kapoor and produced by Irada Entertainment for online streaming platform ALT Balaji and ZEE5.Ekta Kapoor's upcoming web series titled 'The Verdict' is based on 1959 caseEkta Kapoor on remaking 1959 case again!

NBC had made a four-year $1.3 billion ($330 million/year) bid in the spring of 2002 to renew its NBA rights, but the league instead went to ESPN and ABC with a six-year deal worth $2.4 billion ($400 million/year), a total of $4.6 billion ($766 million/year) when adding the cable deal with Turner Sports. Partially due to the retirement of Michael Jordan, the league suffered ratings decline after ESPN and ABC took over the rights. The NBA extended its national TV package on June 27, 2007 worth eight-year $7.4 billion ($930 million/year) through the 2015–16 season, during which the league had its new resurgence leading by renewed Celtics–Lakers rivalry and LeBron James. On October 6, 2014, NBA announced a nine-year $24 billion ($2.7 billion/year) extension with ESPN, ABC and Turner Sports beginning with the 2016–17 season and running through the 2024–25 season \\\\- the second most expensive media rights in the world after NFL and on a par with Premier League in annual rights fee from 2016–17 to 2018–19 season. In the summer of 1987, Turner Broadcasting System signed a new joint broadcast contract between TBS and TNT to split broadcast NBA games starting from the 1988-89 season. TNT held rights to broadcast the NBA draft, most NBA regular season and playoff games, while TBS only aired single games or doubleheaders once a week. The 2001-02 season would mark the final year of regular NBA coverage on TBS, Turner Sports signed a new NBA television contract in which TNT would assume rights to the company's NBA package while TBS would discontinue game coverage altogether. In recent years however, TBS has served as an overflow feed during the playoffs while also simulcasting the 2015, 2016, and 2017 NBA All-Star Game. Subsequently ESPN regained the NBA in 2002-03 season and took over TBS's half of cable television rights. ==Year-by- year summary2010=== In addition, unlike NBC or its preceding rightsholder CBS, ABC does not televise the NBA All-Star Game (with TNT instead holding the exclusive television rights to the game itself and most other events held during All-Star Weekend). Also unlike the other networks, ABC rarely televises either of the NBA's Conference Finals series. TNT airs one Conference Final exclusively each year (the Western Conference Finals in 2003, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016 and 2018. and the Eastern Conference Finals in 2005, 2007, 2009, 2011, 2013, 2015 and 2017, while ESPN will get the other. With the exception of 2004, 2010, 2012, and 2015 (when the network did not air any games from that round at all), ABC airs Conference Final matches – whichever one to which ESPN holds the rights in a given year – held on weekends. Due to the checkerboard schedule of the NBA Playoffs (in which games are scheduled every other day), this is limited to one game per Conference Final, as series do not often reach a sixth or seventh game (for example, the network aired only Game 3 of the 2009 Western Conference Finals; ABC was scheduled to air the Sunday Game 7 of the series, however, the Los Angeles Lakers won the series in Game 6). ===2011=== On May 11, 2011, Turner Sports (this includes TBS) broadcast its 1,000th playoff telecast. In July 2011, it was announced that Shaquille O'Neal would join TNT as an analyst and he signed a multi-year agreement. Normally the TNT studio crew of Ernie Johnson, Kenny Smith and Charles Barkley would stay in the TNT Atlanta studios for all of the regular season and the first two rounds of the playoffs. However, in the 2010-11 NBA season the studio crew started taking their pre- game, halftime and Inside the NBA shows on the road in the regular season, specifically select games involving the Miami Heat on TNT, due to the heightened media coverage surrounding the Heat's acquisitions of LeBron James and Chris Bosh. The substitute studio hosts will also be on hand for Inside the NBA and the other game's pre-game and halftime presentations; the crew consists of Matt Winer, Chris Webber and Kevin McHale. ABC was criticized for focusing its coverage on a select number of teams, particularly the decision to broadcast a Lakers-Heat game on its Christmas Day schedule for three consecutive years. However, for 2007, ABC decided to break this tradition by instead having the Heat, for the fourth straight time, appear on Christmas Day facing the 2007 Eastern Conference Champions, the Cleveland Cavaliers. In 2008, the Boston Celtics replaced the Heat on the Christmas Day schedule, and faced the Los Angeles Lakers; and in 2009, the Cavaliers played the Lakers on Christmas Day. However, the Heat-Lakers Christmas Day special would make its return in the 2010–11 NBA season, as a result of LeBron James' recent move from the Cleveland franchise to Miami. For the 2011–12 NBA season, the Lakers and Heat played again on Christmas Day, but against separate opponents. The Lakers played the Chicago Bulls, while the Heat played the Dallas Mavericks in a rematch of the 2011 NBA Finals; both the Bulls and Mavericks made their ABC Christmas Day debuts, which also acted as the league's opening day that season due to the 2011 NBA lockout delaying the start of the season. In the case of the latter, ABC aired the pre-game championship ring and banner ceremony for the Mavericks, which marked the first time in NBA history a national broadcast network televised the ceremony. For the 2011 NBA postseason, ESPN used an updated composition of the \\"Fast Break\\" theme music for the postseason, yet the original composition was still used for the regular season through the 2015-16 NBA season. ===2013=== During the 2013 Western Conference Finals, a new graphics package debuted for ESPN's NBA telecasts. The graphics featured 3-dimensional renderings of the team logos, along with the use of specific themes and backgrounds to accompany each of them. During the 2015 NBA Finals, the graphics were updated to reflect the new design used in ESPN's NBA Countdown broadcasts. However, during 2015-16 NBA season, the graphics were reverted to the previous package used since 2013. On May 17, 2016, the graphics, which were first seen during the previous year's championship, were used again for the 2016 Eastern Conference Finals and NBA Finals. ===2015=== During the 2015 NBA Finals, the graphics were updated with gold coloring, patterned backgrounds, and a modern, unified font. At the start of the 2015-16 season however, ESPN reverted to the banner used since 2013. ===2016=== On July 17, 2015, ESPN announced that ABC would add a series of eight of Saturday night games to its slate of broadcasts in the 2015–16 season. The first of these games will air on January 23, 2016, and will air mostly bi-weekly until the end of the regular season. As a result of this change, ABC will no longer have regular Sunday doubleheaders. For the 2015-16 season, the NBA and Turner Sports partnered with NextVR to stream the Warriors vs. Pelicans, the first- ever game to be broadcast live in virtual reality. Beginning with the 2016 NBA preseason on October 4, 2016, ABC's graphics were updated again, this time, they are formatted for the full 16:9 letterbox presentation. The score bar, which is significantly larger than the previous one (used since the 2013 Western Conference Finals), was given a complete overhaul, with a numerical representation of timeouts replacing the \\"lights\\" used since the 2010-11 season and a permanent \\"stats bar\\" being moved to the right side of the score bar. The new, co-branded NBA on ESPN logo is now seen as an overlay on the upper left hand corner of the 16:9 screen. As was the case the previous two years, the gold coloring and patterned backgrounds were used again for the 2017 NBA Finals. Notably, this is the first time that both ESPN and ABC have used the full 16:9 frame for its graphics in the networks' NBA coverage. , ABC's broadcast team currently consists of Mike Breen, Mark Jackson and Jeff Van Gundy, while the secondary broadcast team consists of Mike Tirico and Hubie Brown, with either Mark Jones, Ryan Ruocco or Dave Pasch filling in when Tirico has other commitments. The NBA Countdown studio team consists of host Sage Steele, and analysts Jalen Rose and Doug Collins. ABC's second team of Tirico and Brown also comprise the lead team for NBA Finals coverage on ESPN Radio, with Kevin Calabro subbing in for Tirico on some occasions. Jackson briefly left the broadcast booth to serve as head coach of the Golden State Warriors from 2011 to 2014. Prior to the 2011–12 season, ABC reassigned Stuart Scott to another role while the studio team worked without a main host in a more free-flowing approach. This experiment ended prior to the 2013–14 season, when Sage Steele became the lead host of Countdown. Magic Johnson, Jon Barry, Michael Wilbon, Bill Simmons, and Chris Broussard have previously served as analysts for NBA Countdown. ===2017=== For the 2016–17 season, Mark Jones replaced Mike Tirico as part of the secondary broadcast team on ABC with Hubie Brown as Tirico left for NBC. Also, Doug Collins left NBA Countdown and joined ESPN's roster of game analysts, returning to a position he previously held while working with NBC and TNT. Steele was replaced as host by Michelle Beadle during the season. Also, for the 2016-17 NBA season, ESPN used another updated composition of the \\"Fast Break\\" theme music. This time, for the regular season, replacing the original composition that was first used by ABC since the 2004-05 season and by ESPN two seasons later. ESPN introduced a revamped on-air presentation and branding for its NBA coverage, developed with the creative agency Big Block, as well as a new logo. The new design was inspired by \\"premium\\" consumer brands, and places a heavier focus on team logos and colors as the basis of its design, as opposed to visual environments and settings. When introduced during the pre-season, the new package used a noticeably large scorebar, although it has since been reduced in size. For the 2016-17 season, TNT announced that it would air a new series of Monday-night doubleheaders during the later half of the season, beginning on January 16, 2017. Monday night games from February 27 to March 27 were branded as Players Only broadcasts, featuring only former NBA players and without a traditional play-by-play announcer. Additionally, TNT announced that it would hold a \\"Road Show\\" tour in various cities throughout the season, which will feature fan experiences and festivities, and a live broadcast of Inside the NBA on- location. The tour will begin in Cleveland outside the Quicken Loans Arena, host of TNT's opening night game featuring the Cleveland Cavaliers. TNT normally aired NBA Christmas Day games only if it falls on a Thursday (except during the 2011–12 season). However, the network announced that they would air a Christmas Day game on December 25, 2017 (a Monday) featuring the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Los Angeles Lakers. It also marked the first time that the Inside the NBA crew of Ernie Johnson, Kenny Smith, Charles Barkley and Shaquille O'Neal called the game. TNT also announced that the Players Only games will now air every Tuesday starting January 23; the franchise also expanded to include Tuesday night games on NBA TV during the first half of the season. ===2018=== For the 2017-18 season, the stat bar on ABC is only shown at the beginning of the game and after commercial breaks. ===2019=== For the 2019 Finals (the first to feature the Toronto Raptors), TSN and Sportsnet, the main Canadian rightsholders of both the NBA and the Raptors, were permitted to broadcast distinct Canadian telecasts, in addition to the ABC telecast being simulcast on their co-owned broadcast networks. Telecasts on both TSN and Sportsnet use a common technical crew employed by Raptors team owner Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment. ==ReferencesSee also== * * * List of NBA on ABC commentators * List of NBA on ESPN broadcasters * List of NBA on TNT commentators * NBA on television in the 1950s * NBA on television in the 1960s * NBA on television in the 1970s * NBA on television in the 1990s * NBA on television in the 2000s Category:ABC Sports Category:ESPN Category:Turner Sports Category:Solar Entertainment Corporation Category:ABS-CBN Category:2010s in American television ","title":"NBA on television in the 2010s"},{"id":"61398966","text":"Erna Putz (born 3 May 1946) is an Austrian theologian and writer who wrote and edited books on conscientious objector and martyr Franz Jägerstätter, determined to promote his faithful life to the public since 1979. ==Early life== Putz grew up in Ohlsdorf, Austria. ==Bibliography== *Putz, Erna (1985).

The series stars Jennifer Winget, Rajat Kapoor, Seema Biswas and Tanuj Virwani. Army lawyer, Monica Mehra, gets roped in to solve, what seems like an open and shut case, of the death of an army officer and two militant suspects, killed in an encounter. However, as the facts unfold, she realises that the case is way more complex than what it appears to be. Will she be able to crack the code? ==Plot== The series revolves around an Indian Army Lawyer Monica Mehra who discovers a conspiracy plot during her investigation of a military encounter case. The series starts with a flashback scene, where three military men (Maj. Shakti Mandappa, Maj. Gaurav Shekhawat and Maj. Ajay Paswan) are following two terrorists. After ambushing them, a gunfire battle ensues, where the two terrorists are killed with Maj. Paswan martyred. At the nearby Indian Army base in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, after facing protests from locals disputing the military's characterization of a terrorist encounter as fake, the mother of the slain Indian asks for justice. After she immolates herself and suffers burns, the military establishment hires an Army lawyer (Monica Mehra) to probe the incident independently. Monica is shown to be a fierce and unafraid individual, who just weeks away from her wedding, accepts the order for investigation upon the urge of the military head of the base, Col. Suryaveer Chauhan, who incidentally happens to be a family friend. Initially, Monica finds the incident an open-and-shut case. However, after additional questioning of Shakti and Gaurav, she suspects them of wrong-doing. In reaction, the two hire Angad Sandhu as their counsel, who co-incidentally happens to be Monica's ex-boyfriend. After a series of confrontations and mishaps, Monica and Angad team up together to learn the truth. After days of twists and turns, Monica confronts Gaurav, who under emotional distress, reveals the truth partly. Gaurav says that he and Shakti are gay and they love each other. Even after Shakti's marriage and kid, they continued to maintain their same-sex relationship by making sure they were stationed at the same base. Gaurav says that after Maj. Paswan learned of their truth, afraid that he may expose them one day, Shakti and Gaurav plot to kill him with a fake terrorist encounter as a ruse. As the series ends, Shakti is taken into military police custody while Gaurav commits suicide. As Monica leaves for home, she remembers another detail that bothers her and returns to the base. She confronts Shakti to unveil the remaining truth and Shakti tells her that Col. Chauhan wanted purity in the military and asks her to confront him. After setting up a routine conversation with Col. Chauhan, in a fit of rage, he admits that he directed Shakti and Gaurav to kill Ajay as he disapproved of his engagement with his daughter as Ajay belonged to a different caste that he felt were inferior to his. He blackmailed Shakti to commit this crime to protect his gay identity. Monica finally exposes Col. Chauhan and admonishes him for wearing a military uniform that is meant to serve all irrespective of gender or societal status while committing such crimes. She brings forth his daughter, Gayatri, who slaps him and abandons him. The series ends with a tribute to the brave men and women of the Indian armed forces. == Cast == * Jennifer Winget as Major Monica Mehra * Tanuj Virwani as Legal Council Angad Sandhu * Rajat Kapoor Col.

Born in Vienna, Austria, and having lived most of his adult life in Tanganyika, he died at age 73 in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Hans Cory had arrived before the First World War in the former colony of German East Africa. After the German defeat in World War I, Great Britain took over Tanganyika as mandate territory, and Cory was sent to a British prison camp in Palestine as a prisoner of war. After this, he returned to Tanganyika and became a British colonial officer. Speaking Swahili and several local dialects, he had a special interest in the cultural traditions of different ethnic groups, at the time called \\"Tribes\\". A self-taught ethnologist, Cory collected extensive ethnographic field data, traditional paintings or sculptures. Based on this, he published several books in English about such subjects as traditional law, ethnic histories and beliefs, initiation rites, food and plants, traditional songs or poetry.Listen to the sound archives from the 1950s, where he read Swahili poetry in a dramatic style and with his German accent. In particular, he collected numerous clay figurines used for initiation rites and published several works on this topic. According to the German ethnologist Elisabeth Grohs who studied initiation rites and figurines in Tanzania in the 1960s, Cory donated a large number of these figurines to the Dar es Salaam National Museum. From the 1950s onwards, he was conducting a government project to collect and codify the customary law of a number of ethnic groups, such as the Sukuma, Nyamwezi, Haya, Gogo and others.

It is situated at the confluence of the Volga and Tvertsa rivers, on the left bank of the Volga, just near the river mouth of Tvertsa. The construction began in 1935, near the site of the demolished , and was completed by 1938. Both architects and most of the workers on site were prisoners of the labour camp (part of the Gulag). Because of the compromises and corner-cutting made during the planning and construction, the building's structure began to decline by the end of 1980s. Due to the financial difficulties that city experienced in 1990s and early 2000s, local authorities were unable to afford proper repairs, which lead to further deterioration. By that time, following the decline of water transport in the region, the river terminal building was out of the commission for almost a decade. In the following years, up until 2011, it was sometimes used as a venue for art expositions, while some of the sections were rented out to various tenants. On the eve of August 7, 2017, main building began collapsing—a process that continued on the next day, eventually leading to the loss of external walls, floor structures and the roof. == Events after the collapse == Immediately after the event, the governor of the Tver Oblast, announced that terminal's building will be restored in its historical form. However, no firm dates were announced with the regard to that statement. On August 28 of 2017 one of the regional media outlets has reported that local authorities knew that building was about to collapse for at least few months, as they've ordered an inspection on building's constructions, but ultimately decided to hold off with emergency repairs because of their cost. leftBy November 2017 most of the rubble from the collapse was cleared, and any unstable leftovers were forced down. The building itself was covered with decorative banner and fenced off from the pier and pedestrian walkways in order to protect the people from any random falling debris. In April 2018 Aleksandra Smirnova, deputy head of Tver's regional chapter of the All-Russian Society for the Protection of Monuments of History and Culture has stated in the interview that budget of the Tver Oblast for 2018 has no money allocated for the emergency repairs or the reconstruction of the terminal. On June 19 of 2019 the chairman of Tver Duma (lower house of the regional parliament) Evgeny Pichuyev, answering to the question about river terminal's fate, has stated that city has no funds for the restoration, and that it's necessary to find an investor who will be interested in funding the repairs. On July 22 of 2019 local authorities have announced that a complex engineering study will be undertaken in order to develop suggestions and instructions on the restoration procedure. However, it was also stated that no hard decision on the building's fate will be made until the study is complete: should the engineers decide that there's an irreparable damage, the building most likely will be demolished rather than restored. In accordance with the contract for the study, its results should be delivered to the authorities no later than December 20, 2019. As of December 26, 2019, those were not made publicly available. On December 11, 2019, the governor of the Tver Oblast, stated in the interview that it is planned to construct a brand-new building for the river terminal instead of restoring a historical one, employing \\"new technologies\\". Rudenya announced that 800 million rubles are already secured to fund the construction. In the same interview he also stated that there are plans to partially restore an building complex along with the terminal's construction (it is widely believed that the former was occupying the same spot as the river terminal, just before it got demolished in the early 1930s). Governor has failed to mention how local authorities will go around the federal law which strictly prohibits to demolish any buildings which were declared as objects of cultural heritage of the peoples of the Russian Federation. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Post-collapse video of the terminal * Historic photos of the building and its site Category:Transport infrastructure completed in 1938 Category:Stalinist architecture Category:Ports and harbours of Russia Category:Water transport in Russia ","title":"Tver River Terminal"},{"id":"61399305","text":"Esther Sanz (born 6 December 1974) is a Spanish badminton player, born in Málaga.

He was the son of the Dutch vice-admiral Karel or Carel van der Putte and his wife Johanna Cornelia Samuels Biscop. Admiral Van der Putte died when Samuel was five years old. He studied law in Leiden, getting his degree in 1714 and returning to work in Vlissingen, where he became an alderman the next year. In 1718, he left for Italy, improving his Italian and studying medicine in Padua. He returned to the Netherlands in 1721 but soon left for Constantinople in the Ottoman Empire. From there, he visited the Aegean Archipelago, Cairo, the Sinai, and Palestine. From Aleppo in Syria, he traveled with a caravan to Isfahan, Persia, and thence to Dutch-allied Cochin in India. He travelled extensively through India. disguised as a Muslim trader, meeting the Jesuit missionary Ippolito Desideri in Patna in August 1725. He copied about 20 pages of Desideri's notes on Tibet and, after visiting Dutch Ceylon the next year, he passed through the Mughal Empire and followed Desideri's route through Nepal and Ladakh to Lhasa in Tibet, reaching it about 1728. The Dalai Lama at the time was the 7th incarnation, Kelzang Gyatso, but the warlord Polhané Sönam Topgyé had just overcome a coup with Chinese help. He maintained his position by permitting their ambans to station troops in Lhasa and act as de facto governors. Unlike other visitors to the interior of China at the time, usually Catholic missionaries, Van der Putte was acting as a commercial agent. Besides an anonymous French trader who reached Lhasa in 1717, Van der Putte is the only foreign laymen known to have visited Tibet during the 18th century. He had been obliged by local xenophobia and Qing border regulations to again disguise himself as a native on his journey to avoid assault or arrest and deportation to Guangzhou and Portuguese Macao. In Lhasa, he learned Standard Tibetan and befriended its lamas while staying with the Capuchin mission kept by Gioacchino da San Anatolia, Francesco della Penna, Cassiano da Macerata, and others. His religious opinions scandalized the Italian monks, whose letters variously describe him as agnostic or heretical. Cassiano nonetheless describes him as an honest man. He left Lhasa for Beijing (then romanized as \\"Peking\\") in 1731 in the company of a caravan of lamas bound for the imperial capital. It followed the same route later made famous by Abbé Huc's account of his travels. A passage of Putte's journals quoted in a missionary's letter describes his passage of the upper Yangtze (under the name \\"Bicin\\" or \\"Bi-tsion\\") on hide boats; the river was so wide and passage so slow that the travelers were obliged to rest on an island in the middle of the stream before completing the crossing the next day. The route continued north through Qinghai (\\"Koko Nor\\") and east across the Ordos Loop to the Great Wall of China northwest of the capital. After his visit to Beijing, he returned to Lhasa in 1736 along a more southerly route that took him through Kham and southeastern Tibet. While in Lhasa, he stayed at the house that had been abandoned by the Catholic monks during his absence. During one of his visits in Lhasa, his conversation with the son of a minister from Sikkim led to his creating a manuscript map of the states of the central Himalayas, the first European map to correctly mark Bhutan (under a variation of the name \\"Drukpa\\") as an independent state in the correct location instead of as a misunderstanding of Tibet. He reached India again around 1737, using the arduous western route through western Tibet and Kashmir. Returned to India, he witnessed Nader Shah's 1739 Sack of Delhi following the Battle of Karnal before leaving Bengal to settle in Batavia, Dutch East Indies in 1743. His last journey seems to have been a visit to Mount Ophir in Dutch Malacca in September of that year. Intending to return home to the Netherlands, he fell ill and died on 27 September 1745 at Batavia.. ==Works== The importance of Van der Putte's exploration was less than that of some of his contemporaries since his constant travels kept him from publishing any public narrative of his observations. Instead, from his deathbed in Batavia, his will directed that his journal and many noteswhich he had kept on slips of paper during his travelsbe burned. He did this to prevent their \\"improper use\\", which some have taken to mean risking the addition of fraudulent notes in order to exploit the authority of his name and others to mean permitting their use by the British.. Nonetheless, some scholars have compiled what is known of his travels (mostly through the letters of the various missionaries) and some of his surviving belongings are kept at the museum in The Hague. Two of his notes known to have survived were two undated manuscript maps, one that drawn of the eastern Himalayan states mentioned above and the other a map of Tibet with its places named in Tibetan and Italian. Both were held by a museum in Middelburg, where they were destroyed by Allied bombing during World War II. The Himalayan map survived in duplicate thanks to its inclusion by Sir Clements Markham in his book on George Bogle's later trip to Tibet. ==References Notes = Footnotes = Bibliography === * . * . * , reprinted 2004. * , reprinted by Asian Educational Services 1996. * . * . * , reprinted by Routledge 2011. * . * , reprinted 2004.

It also included Section Clerks for the related clerical work. The foundations for the Corps were laid in 1915, though it only formally came into being on 1st March 1917 before being further formalised by an Army Order in early November 1918. Led by Mrs Atholl Stewart as Superintendent of Women, who reported to Brigadier-General Hill Godfrey Morgan, it consisted of civilian women (known as Industrial Members) but was under the control of the Army Service Corps. Below Stewart were (in descending order of seniority) Area Inspectors of Women, Assistant Superintendents, Deputy Superintendents, Forwarding Supervisors, Supervisors of Women Labour, Deputy Assistant Supervisors and Gang Supervisors. Largely drawn from among women servants but also including some women of independent means with their own horses, normal members earned an average of 26 to 30 shillings a week by 1919, drawing army rations and sometimes with a caravan (for messing rather than accommodation) and cook assigned to their gang as a mess. Their uniform consisted of gaiters, haversack, dark green breeches, hats and jerseys, khaki overcoat, overalls and black boots, with brass shoulder insignia of the initials \\"FC\\". Higher ranks wore a khaki tunic and shirt, shoulder rank badges, shoulder \\"FC\\" insignia and a brass badge showing \\"FC\\" within the eight-pointed star of the Royal Army Service Corps. The WFC numbered 8,000 by 1917, though this had dropped to about 6,000 by 1919.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. ==History== In 1875, Felix Raniville and Simeon Sikes, opened a leather-goods workshop specializing in industrial belts. Raniville soon bought out his partner, and later purchased a larger building on Pearl Street, long with adjacent property on Lyon. He built a small factory and power plant on the river at the end of Lyon Street and between 1900 and 1910 constructed what is now the Exhibitors Building next to the plant. The building was originally designed to house business offices that were rented out to smaller companies. In 1925, during Grand Rapids' furniture- making boom, local developer Gustave Hendricks conceived the idea of developing a set of furniture exhibition buildings located near the city's largest hotel, the Pantlind (now the Amway Grand Plaza Hotel). He first purchased the Nelson-Mather Building located across the street from the Pantlind; space in the building was sold out even before Hendricks completed the renovations. Hendricks then purchased Raniville's office building on Lyon, extensively remodeled it to house furniture showrooms, and renamed it the Fine Arts Building. However, during the Great Depression, many exhibitors had to give up their space; with declining tenancy, the building was taken over by the city for back taxes. In 1943 the city leased the building to the US Army Weather School. In 1945, a group of local businessmen purchased the building and re-renovated it to house furniture showrooms. They changed its name to the Exhibitors Building. In 1970, the building was sold to Hollis M. Baker, and in 1979 the Amway Properties Corporation purchased the building and incorporated it into the Amway Grand Plaza complex. ==Description== The Exhibitors Building is an eight-story, trapezoid-shape, commercial building constructed of buff brick. The building measures 213 feet by 100 feet. It has terra cotta Italian Renaissance friezes and pilasters on the facades using beige, green, yellow, ochre, and red terra cotta tiles. Tilework images include griffins, fruit festoons, lion heads, and details symbolic of furniture-making. ==References== Category:National Register of Historic Places in Kent County, Michigan Category:Renaissance Revival architecture in Michigan Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1925 ","title":"Exhibitors Building (Grand Rapids, Michigan)"},{"id":"61399768","text":"Charles Greville (2 November 1762, in Wilbury House, Cholderton, Wiltshire – 26 August 1832, in Hanover Square, London)'Births, Deaths, Marriages and Obituaries' The Morning Post (London, England), Monday, September 03, 1832; Issue 19262.

SFD was established in 1974 and began operations in 1975. SFD's activities include development, finance, trade and funding. SFD is led by H.E. Mr. Ahmed bin Aqeel Al-khateeb who is the Chairman of the Board of Directors and Minister of Tourism for Saudi Arabia. Dr. Khalid S. Alkhudairy is the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of SFD. ==History== SFD was established in 1974, it has financed infrastructure programs (dams, transport) and vital social projects (healthcare facilities; Water, Sanitation and Health (WASH) programs and education) alongside other sectors such as energy and agriculture. ==Funding== SFD’s capital now amounts to Saudi Arabian Riyals (SAR) 31 billion (US $8.3 billion), from an initial investment of SAR 10 billion (US $2.6 billion). SFD has contributed official development assistance (ODA) to 1000 projects in 85 countries through loan and grant mechanisms. In 2017, SFD was responsible for 43.9% of ODA dispersed by Saudi government agencies. SFD delivers funding bi-laterally; however, it is also engaged in the multilateral development system and works with organizations such as such as the United Nations, the World Bank , Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development, Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa, Islamic Development Bank, OPEC Fund for International Development, French Development Agency and the United Kingdom’s Department for International Development (DFID). SFD’s funding is multiregional and provides development assistance to all developing countries,Ferabolli, Silvia. Arab Regionalism: a Post-Structural Perspective. Routledge, 2016. although it prioritizes the least developed and low-income countries. According to the World Bank, SFD is one of the most global of Arab international development funds, financing projects in Europe and South America, alongside other regions. ===Official Development Assistance=== In 2014, Saudi Arabia’s gross ODA amounted to SAR 54 billion (US $14.4 billion), which represented 1.90% of the Kingdom’s Gross National Income (GNI), which far exceeded the agreed international 0.70% ODA/GNI target. In the same year, Saudi Arabia ranked higher in contributions than 28 other DAC member countries including the United Kingdom (0.70%), and the US (0.19%). Saudi Arabia became a Development Assistance Committee (DAC) Participant of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in 2018 and began reporting its ODA contributions that same year. Saudi Arabia is one of the largest providers in terms of volume, with increasing levels of ODA. As of 2020, Saudi Arabia has been ranked fifth globally, and first in the Arab world, for its provision of humanitarian aid. According to the UN Financial Tracking Service platform, Saudi Arabia contributed SAR 4.8 billion (US $1.2 billion) or 5.5% of the total amount of international spending on relief programs. ==Multi-Country Programs== Since its founding in 1974, SFD’s methodology has been to assess the critical needs of partner nations - whether those be in energy, water, transportation or other principal development areas - and work to finance projects that address a particular need, in line with the UN Sustainable Development Goals. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, SFD, as a member of the Arab Coordination Group, will contribute funding to help developing countries economically recover from the recession caused by the pandemic. Collectively, the Arab Coordination Group has committed SAR 375 billion (US $10 billion) to this effort. ==Reducing Isolation in Landlocked Countries== SFD has supported transportation and infrastructure projects designed to reduce social and economic isolation in landlocked African countries. The lack of infrastructure and connectivity between such countries has led to a reduction in exports, as transport costs are estimated to comprise about 77% of the value of exports. This has had a significant impact on landlocked countries’ abilities to trade with their neighbours. To combat this, SFD has contributed to the financing of a number of internal and external road projects in Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Niger, Mali and Chad, linking them to seaports in Djibouti, Ghana and Mauritania. Due to their geographical location, the countries have experienced significant social and economic challenges; the development of the roads and transportation links is expected to enhance trade and connectivity in the region, with the potential to generate jobs and increase business opportunities for small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). ==Saudi Program for Wells and Rural Development in Africa== SFD established this program to mitigate the effects of drought in rural regions in several African countries. Under the program, over 6,000 water facilities have been equipped, and 2.5 million people have secured improved access to water. ==Partnerships and Multi-Lateral Official Development Assistance== SFD continues to partner with organizations such as the United Nations, the World Bank, the United Kingdom’s Department for International Development (DFID), Agence française de dévelopement (AFD) and Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), United Nations International Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). SFD also collaborates with regional development partners such as the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB), the Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa (BADEA), the Abu Dhabi Fund for Development (ADFD), the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development (FKDEA), the OPEC Fund for International Development (OFID), the ECOWAS Investment and Development Bank (EBID) and the West African Development Bank (BOAD) . ===United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)=== Saudi Arabia, via SFD, is a leading donor to UNHCR globally. SFD has provided more than SAR 200 million (US $54 million) to 11 UNHCR projects. According to the UNHCR, Saudi contributions have enabled a continued humanitarian response in the Middle East and other regions, particularly to those affected by the Yemen, Syria, Afghanistan, and Rohingya crisis. SFD has supported the UNHCR’s humanitarian efforts in refugee camps, such as the Al- Azraq Camp in Jordan. SFD has provided SAR 34.5 million (US $9.2 million) to two projects to support the construction of an electrical network system in the camp. Implemented in two phases, the electrical network will connect all shelters, plot lighting, markets and various public spaces in the Al- Azraq camp to the electrical grid, improving access to electricity for more than 25,000 Syrian refugees living in the camp. ===United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) for Palestine Refugees in the Near East=== SFD has a long- standing legacy of supporting Palestinians and the Palestinian cause through UNRWA projects. In 2019, Saudi Arabia, through SFD, was recognised as one the top three largest donor to UNRWA and has donated SAR 3 billion (US $800 million) to the agency since 1994. To date, SFD has contributed to 34 UNRWA programs and projects in support of Palestinians, such as large-scale maintenance projects that will ensure that 268 schools and health centres in Syria, Jordan, Gaza, Lebanon and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem are structurally sound. These projects include support to maintain Palestinian refugee camps in different countries in the Middle East such as the UNRWA Al- Safsaf School in Dera’a refugee camp in Syria, which was inaugurated in 2020. SFD’s funding has also contributed to the renovation of schools in the West Bank, where 46,000 Palestinian refugee children were educated in the 2019-2020 academic year at 96 schools run by the UNRWA. ===United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)=== SFD has partnered with the UNDP on several projects in the Gaza Strip to provide housing that benefits approximately 13,466 families from the region. In February 2020, SFD signed an additional SAR 37.5 million (US $10 million) agreement with UNDP and UNRWA to fund the repair and reconstruction of houses in the Gaza Strip. This fourth amendment brings the total SFD contribution to SAR 306 million (US $81.5 million). SFD’s partnership with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is crucial to improving sustainable development in Pakistan. SFD has provided SAR 43.7 million (US $11.6 million) to the UNDP to develop the infrastructure of the Swat district in Pakistan. As a result of the funds provided by SFD, more than 800,000 people in the Swat district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province stand to benefit from the restoration of 639 ongoing basic community infrastructure schemes. ===United Nations International Children's Fund (UNICEF)=== UNICEF has recognized Saudi Arabia for its generous support for UNICEF, stating it had contributed significantly to development projects that benefit millions of children around the world. SFD has supported UNICEF with SAR 86 million (US $23 million) for education, health, nutrition and water and sanitation services in Pakistan. This has culminated in the development of schools in the Swat Valley region of Pakistan. ==Areas of Geographical Cooperation== SFD is one of Africa’s largest contributors to sustainable development aid, and since 1975 has contributed SAR 38 billion (US $10 billion) in financial assistance to more than 400 development projects in 46 African countries. SFD has worked on several cross-border projects, such as the Tadjoura Port, in Djibouti, and the development of transport links in West and Central Africa. Other African countries include Burkina Faso, Burundi, Comoros Islands, Chad, Djibouti, Egypt, Ethiopia, Gambia, Kenya, Liberia, Mauritius, Mauritania, Morocco, Sudan and Tunisia. In 2019, SFD signed two loans worth SAR 367 million (US $97.8 million) to finance the construction of roads and schools in Afghanistan. SFD also works with countries in Asia such as Bahrain, Jordan, Maldives, Nepal, Kyrgyzstan, Republic of Uzbekistan and Sri Lanka. To date SFD has contributed SAR 1.5 billion (US $411 million) in financial assistance to more than 21 countries in Europe, South America and the Caribbean. SFD is financing and supporting infrastructure projects in European countries such as Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Republic of Kosovo alongside projects in South American and Caribbean countries including Brazil, Cuba and Jamaica. ==References== Category:1974 establishments in Saudi Arabia Category:Government agencies of Saudi Arabia ","title":"Saudi Fund for Development (SFD)"},{"id":"61399818","text":"Louis Cutter Wheeler (1910–1980) was an American botanist and professor of botany with an international reputation for his research on Euphorbiaceae. ==Biography== Louis Cutter Wheeler's father was a citrus farmer in California, where the summer appearance of the \\"intricate inflorescence\\" of Euphorbia albomarginata (rattlesnake weed) aroused Louis's interest in botany. After attending La Verne Junior College, he studied botany from 1931 to 1933 at UCLA under Carl Epling and from 1933 to 1934 at Claremont University College under Philip A. Munz. After graduating in 1934 with a master's degree, Wheeler worked for the U.S. Forest Service in the Siskiyou Mountains and in the Angeles National Forest within the San Gabriel Mountains. From 1936 to 1939 he was a graduate student at Harvard University. He was a co-collector with Bernice Giduz Schubert. From 1939 to 1945 Wheeler was a botany instructor and research assistant at several different universities. At the University of Southern California, he became an assistant professor in 1945 and was eventually promoted to associate professor and then full professor, retiring as professor emeritus in 1975. The Flora of Ceylon Project was supported by the Smithsonian Institution, the Ceylon Department of Agriculture, and the University of Ceylon, Peradeniya. Funded by the Project, Wheeler collected in the Puttalam District (1969), Anuradhapura District (1971), and Kandy District (1977). ==Family== Louis Cutter Wheeler an older brother, Willis Hayes (1906–1996), and 4 sisters, Hazel Ruth (1908–2013), Florence Elizabeth (1914–1920), Muriel Flora (1917–2006), and Janet Lucile (1919–2016). Their father was born in Kansas and arrived in California around 1903 from Colorado. Their mother was born in Massachusetts and belonged to New England's Cutter family, whose history was written by William Richard Cutter. Louis Cutter Wheeler married Leota May Brice (1909–1995) in 1935. They had two daughters. Willis Hayes Wheeler became a plant pathologist and botanist, working for the USDA. ==Selected publicationsArticles=== * 1938. Lichens of Point Lobos Reserve.

He was a descendant of Visigothic royalty and held a position of power over the Christians of his region. He was possibly a priest or censor,Marinas, Iván Pérez.

He wrote in Arabic, which had then become the common language of Mozarabic Christians living in al-Andalus. Arabic was slow to be adopted by the Iberian Catholic Clergy because the Arabic language was enforced by the Islamic government and the Church wanted to appear completely separate from Islam. Hafs ibn Albar's work in translating the Psalms and other theological works has been characterised as integral to the preservation of the Iberian Church under Islam as it allowed Christians who had been raised in an Arabic culture to fully participate in the Christian faith. ==Background== Towards the end of the Visigothic period of Iberian history, the Visigoths were ruled by a monarchy elected by the Church.David Abulafia et al. The New Cambridge Medieval History, Volume 1 c. 500 – c. 700, This system had been stable for some time, but eventually the children of former kings became claimants to the throne and civil wars broke out. In 711, the Visigothic Kingdom, in the middle of one such civil war, fell to Islamic forces. During the invasion there were two Visigothic claimants: the main claimant Roderic ruled from the ancient capital of Toledo and he controlled South-West, whereas Achila II ruled Tarraconensis and Narbonensis in the North-East.Collins, Roger. Visigothic Spain, 409–711. Blackwell Publishing, 2004. Achila was succeeded by his younger brother Ardo in Narbonensis alone as Tarraconensis had been taken by Islamic forces. al-Andalus in the 10th century The fate of the conquered Christians varied from case to case. Standard Dhimmi contracts usually gave Christians and Jews fewer rights than their Muslim counterparts.Balakian, Peter (2003). The Burning Tigris: The Armenian Genocide and America's Response.

Some Scholars believe that the names Romulus and Artabasdus are corruptions of Achila and Ardo respectively. This would explain Romulus' holdings in the east of Spain.The City of Toledo In the centuries following the Islamic conquest of Spain, Romulus' descendants had significant power over the Mozarabs of al-Andalus due to the fact that the representatives of Christian communities, called counts, were required to be Christians themselves.

Abû Sa’îd held extensive estates in central al-Andalus. ===Name=== Hafs is usually remembered by his patronym 'ibn Albar', usually taken to refer to him being the son of Álvaro of Córdoba,Honorii, Cosmographia Iulii, and Chronica Muzarabica. \\"“How can I trust you, since you are a Christian and I am a Moor?” The multiple identities of the Chronicle of Pseudo-Isidore. although some claim that Hafs is more likely to be Álvaro's grandson or descendant. He is also remembered either as al-Qūṭī (the Goth) or al-Qurṭubî (the Cordoban). Some take al-Qurṭubî to be a toponym. Others believe that al-Qurṭubî is either a corruption of al-Qūṭī or a deliberate attempt to link him more closely with Álvaro. He is believed to have had been born with a full Latin or Gothic name, but this has been lost.Pérez Marinas, Iván. \\"The Mozarabic of Cordoba of the ninth century: Society, culture and thought.\\" (2012). In one manuscript he is referred to as ibn al-Quti (Son of the Goth). He appears in Judaeo-Spanish texts as Héféç al- Qouti. In Maghrebi texts he instead appears as Alfuti. This is because the letters: ق and ف (usually romanised as q and f respectively) are especially similar in the Maghrebi Arabic alphabet.Neubauer, Adolf \\"Hafs al-Qouti\\" Revue des Études Juives 30 (1895): 65-69. Such scribal errors at times confused details about his background. David Colville, the first person to translate the works of Hafs ibn Albar into English, believed that Hafs was Jewish. Adolf Neubauer refuted this based on the other works of Hafs, such as his pro- Christian polemics, which were unavailable to Colville. He also rejected the hypothesis that Hafs was a Jewish converso on the basis that Jewish writers who felt uncomfortable with using the works of apostates used the works of Hafs extensively. Neubauer believed Hafs to be an Arab or Syriac Christian due to his use of eastern forms of Arabic. His nickname, 'the Goth', and his gothic patronym suggest a gothic background and not an Arab/Syriac one. Today, he is taken to be of Visigothic background. == Works == Hafs wrote all of his surviving works in Arabic. One of the reasons he did this was to remove, or at least weaken, the link between the Arabic language and Islam. While some see Hafs as moving away from Álvaro's beliefs, others think of him as equally missionary-minded and interested in preserving Christian beliefs and culture. While Álvaro focused on defending Christianity, Hafs was subtly challenging Islam by associating Arabic with Christian works. He used Islamised vocabulary throughout his works (such as referring to the Psalms as suras), even when he expressed Christian ideas completely in opposition to Islam, such as the Trinity or that the Psalms were prophecies of Jesus' life.van Koningsveld, P.. The Arabic Psalter of Hafs ibn Albar al-Quti: Prolegomena for a Critical Edition His free use of complex Arabic poetic forms and Islamic-sounding language limited the marginalisation that Christians felt during the 10th century and after. All major Mozarabic intellectuals who lived after Hafs used Arabic extensively. === Arabic Psalter === Hafs translated the entire book of Psalms into the Arabic language with a poetic prologue of his own, completing the work in 889AD. Each Psalm has a heading explaining whether the Psalm relates to Christ's life, the Church and the spiritual health of believers. An example of this is his heading to Psalm 1, which states \\"This Psalm predicts the Nativity of the Messiah, the son of Mary\\". He did this with the help and permission of Bishop Valens of CórdobaRodriguez, Joaquín Mellado. La lengua de los mozárabes. Otra lectura de las fuentes [The language of the Mozarabs. A new reading of the sources] (2018) (862-875), whom Hafs highly esteemed. It was based on an earlier prose version that Hafs translated from the Old Latin Bible. His newer, more poetic version used the Vulgate more. This Arabic translation is significant as it represents a turning point in the cultural assimilation of native Christians. Only thirty years prior, Álvaro had publicly denounced the use of Arabic amongst Christians. Hafs, on the other hand, fully embraced the Arabic language and his Psalms were translated in Arabic rajaz verses. He was aware that rajaz verses were considered inferior amongst Arabs, but he defended its use on the grounds that it was more musical, was easily understood and allowed for a literal translation.Schippers, A., and J. Dyk. \\"Medieval Opinions on the Difficulty of Translating the Psalms. Some Remarks on Hafs al-Quti's Psalms in Arabic rajaz Metre.\\" Give ear to my Words. Psalms and other Poetry in and around the Hebrew Bible. Essays in honour of Professor NA van Uchelen (1996): 219-226. It was his belief that the Psalms were essentially Hebrew rajaz. Hafs defended his translation on the basis of 1 Corinthians 14, which he interpreted to be the Apostle Paul advocating for the translation of scripture. He said that the Apostle expected people to pray in their own languages. Hafs believed that the Psalms were the bedrock of Christian prayer. He used the example of the translations of the Psalms into Greek, Syriac, Persian and Latin to justify his own translation.Geary, Patrick J. Language and power in the early Middle Ages. UPNE, 2013. He also appealed to the authority of Bishop Valens and a number of monks and priests who encouraged him in his work. He clarified that he intended his translation of the Psalms to be used liturgically in churches and monasteries and for 'the forgiveness of sins'. Hafs' later works often quote the Gospels as translated by Isḥâq ibn Balashk al-Qurṭubî (Spanish: Isaac VelascoPotthast, Daniel. \\"Die andalusische Übersetzung des Römerbriefs.\\" (2011). the Cordoban), completed either 904 or 942 (depending on how one reads the dating inscription), making the translation of the Psalms Hafs' earliest work. His is not the oldest translation of the Psalms into Arabic. Archbishop John of Seville (remembered in Arabic as: زيد المطران Zayd al-Matran) is believed to have produced the translation of the Psalms, Epistles and Gospels preserved in MS Madrid 4971. He also provided a commentary and took part in the Council of Cordoba in 839. He became bishop in 831 and died 851. Hafs' version is said to be more fluent and complex, while John's version is strict and literal. === Other Works === Hafs has also been thought to have translated Orosius' Seven Books of History Against the Pagans as the Kitāb Hurūshiyūsh, though this is now doubted,Ann Christys, Christians in al-Andalus (711-1000) (Abingdon: Routledge, 2002), pp. 140-41 . and the works of Jerome. He wrote a number of original works as well. His Treatise on the Trinity is considered to be the first anti-Islamic polemic written in the West.Burman, Thomas. Religious Polemic and the Intellectual History of the Mozarabs, c. 1050-1200. Brill, 1994. He also wrote a treatise called al-Fiqh and two books: Kitab al- Huruf (the Book of Letters) and Kitâb al-Masâ’il al-Sab῾ wa-al-Khamsîn (the Book of the Fifty-Seven Questions).Guix, Juan Gabriel López. \\"The first biblical translations in the Iberian Peninsula.\\" 1611: translation history magazine 7 (2013): 1-8. Jewish writers of later years referred to Hafs as the author of the Book of al-Quti, a compilation of moral maxims. == Death and Legacy == Ibn Qūṭiyya wrote that Hafs ibn Albar was still alive in 961. Hafs was highly esteemed among the Christians, Jews and Muslims of Spain and his works describing the Trinity, the nature of Christ and the Eucharist were seen as definitive long after his death.Barbash, Faiad. \\"Monferrer-Sala, Juan Pedro,\\" Scripta Theologica Arabica Cristiana. Andalusi Christian Arabic Fragments Preserved in Ms. 83 (al-Maktabah al-Malikiyyah, Rabat): Diplomatic Edition, Critical Apparatus and Indexes\\".\\" Anales del Seminario de Historia de la Filosofía. Vol. 35. No. 1. Universidad Complutense de Madrid, 2018. His translation of the Psalms also remained popular after his death, not only for its intended Ecclesiastic and Monastic use, but among Muslims and Jews as well. It is this version that Al-Qurtubi, Moses ibn Ezra and Ibn Gabirol used. The “Alcalde de los Mozárabes” that existed after Toledo was reconquered by the Christians in 1085 is believed to be the continuation of the title of Count of the Christians of Toledo. The Arabised Christian culture of Toledo would last for centuries after the death of Hafs, with some Arabic cultural elements surviving even into the Early Modern Era.Miller, Howard Delgin.
