He and his brother Kenneth were educated at Charterhouse School. He earned a law degree from Balliol College, Oxford in 1949. Newton served in the British Army Rifle Corps during World War II. ==Career== Newton became a journalist with the Financial Times by chance, after writing a letter to the editor of the newspaper with \\"his views on the nationalisation of the UK iron and steel industry\\", and they offered him a job. In 1950, he was posted to San Francisco as their West Coast correspondent. In 1951, he founded his first business, Sterling International, a San Francisco wholesale paper company specialising in tissue paper, at first importing British products into the US and later specialising in the trading of paper and pulp, manufacturing in Canada, Trinidad and Thailand, and later sold it. Newton founded Sterling Vineyards in 1964 and later, Newton Vineyard. He was responsible for designing and building Sterling Vineyards in 1973, on a hill close to Calistoga, with access to the winery building via an aerial tramway. Prince Charles visited from England in 1977, and was \\"delighted\\" by the winery and its wines. In 1979, Newton sold Sterling to Coca-Cola, and started a new more exclusive venture, Newton Vineyard, a pioneer in Napa Valley Merlot, and best known for its \\"trademark\\" unfiltered Chardonnay and Merlot. ==Personal life== In 1950, he met an American, Anne St. Aubyn, at a party at his home in Pelham Place, Kensington, London. They married on 28 December 1951 at St Dominic's Church, San Francisco (her hometown), and had three children, Carol Boone of San Francisco; Gail Showley of St. Helena; and Nigel Newton of London. Anne Newton died in 1970. In 1979, he married Su Hua Lin, and they divorced in 2005. In later life, he was very proud that his granddaughter Alice, then eight, \\"discovered Harry Potter\\", after his son Nigel Newton, founder of Bloomsbury Publishing, gave her in 1997 a chapter of a new manuscript by the then unknown J. K. Rowling, already rejected by many other publishers, and she loved it. At his home in St. Helena, California, Newton built 15 separate gardens, including Zen, rose, hanging and traditional English, even including a croquet lawn. Newton died on 4 February 2008, at his St. Helena home, aged 81, and was buried there at the Grace Episcopal Church Cemetery. ==References== Category:1926 births Category:2008 deaths Category:Financial Times people Category:People from St. Helena, California Category:American winemakers Category:Journalists from London Category:Alumni of Balliol College, Oxford Category:English winemakers Category:People educated at Charterhouse School ","title":"Peter Newton (winemaker)"},{"id":"56691891","text":"Missing on Lost Island (aka Ztracen√Ω ostrov (Czech), Verschollen Auf Lost Island (German)) is a 2000 Czech/Slovakian adventure game developed by Mayhem Studios and Riki Computer Games, and published by Bohemia Interactive. == Development == Officially developed by Slovak Mayhem Studios, the game's development was actually centered in Bohemia Interactive in the Czech Republic, which is where aspects like the dubbing was completed. The dubbing was done by Jiri Labus, who had previously lent his voice to the previous Slovak adventure game Ve St√≠nu Havrana. The original intention of the title, according to Bonusweb.cz, was to make a serious adventure around the theme of pirates, unlike previous games like the comical The Secret of Monkey Island. According to Absolute Games, the intention of the debut game from Mayhem Studios was a classic title in the style of The Secret of Monkey Island meets Indiana Jones. While ARI Data was supposed to be the publisher in the German language area, as a result of its bankruptcy, Gamepad acquired the distribution license. == Plot and gameplay == Tim and Diana are on a quest to return to their own time period and location. The title is a Czech/Slovakian 3rd POV point-and-click adventure game with English dialogues and subtitles (despite having a German title). Visually, it is reminiscent of the classic adventure games from the first half of the 1990s. The game is in a 256-color palette. The 2D game features handpainted backgrounds. Adventure Archiv enjoyed the game's narrative twists and turns. == Critical reception == Bonusweb.cz thought that while the game had some favourable features, it fell short of promising Czech adventures like Polda 3 and Fairy Tale about Father Frost, Ivan and Nastya. Four Fat Chicks favoured the game's low-key characters to the obnoxious style seen in games like Koala Lumpur: Journey to the Edge. Quandary thought the game was amusing with some delightful animations.

King Sejong selected Kim as consort for his heir apparent, the future King Munjong, in 1427.Veritable Records of Sejong, volume 36. After journeying from her home, Kim camped outside Hanseong and the crown prince was sent to greet her and escort her back to the eastern palace. Crown Princess Hwi requested to visit her natal home in 1428 to attend the burial rites for her grandfather.Veritable Records of Sejong, volume 40. ==Witchcraft== Court records indicate that, in the winter of 1428 ‚Äì 1429, Crown Princess Hwi asked her maid, Ho-cho (Ìò∏Ï¥à), how she could gain the crown prince's love. Ho-cho told her to cut her rivals' shoes into pieces and burn them to ash. She recommended that the consort test the method on two maids that she was already jealous of, Ho-dong (Ìö®Îèô) and Deok-kim (ÎçïÍπÄ), which she promptly did. Crown Princess Hwi then requested further methods to gain her husband's love and Ho-cho instructed her to drain the fluids from a snake, then rub those essences onto a cloth. Ho-cho claimed that if the consort wore that cloth in the presence of the crown prince, he would love her. Meanwhile, another maid, whom the consort had brought to the palace from her natal home, Sun-deok (ÏàúÎçï), discovered the remains of the burnt shoes in her mistress' perfume pouch. Sun-deok questioned Ho-cho as to how the consort had learnt such things, but hid the shoes. When the rumours of Crown Princess Hwi's activities reached Sejong, he ordered that she be confined to her quarters and her staff, including Sun-deok, were questioned.Veritable Records of Sejong, volume 45. Ho-cho was sent to the Uigeumbu and Sun-deok told officials where to find the shoe remains. In shock, Sejong lamented his choice of such a daughter-in-law, ordered that her seal be retracted, her name removed from the ancestral temple and that she be demoted to commoner. The former consort was expelled from the palace so that she would not pollute the royal family.ÈªúÈÇÑÁßÅÁ¨¨, ÁµÇ‰∏ç‰ΩøËñÑË°å‰πã‰∫∫, Ê±öÊàëÂÆ∂Ê≥ï„ÄÇ ==Aftermath== After Kim was demoted, her father was also demoted and her brother was removed from his position in the Dongnyeongbu. Ho- cho was beheaded for instructing her mistress in witchcraft. Several court officials also attempted to have other palace ladies, as well as Kim's parents, interrogated to establish whether they had either been involved in teaching her or covered up her behaviour, but Sejong denied all these requests. ==Family== *Paternal grandfather: Kim Gu-deok (d.1428) (ÍπÄÍµ¨Îçï) **Father: Kim Oh-mun (ÍπÄÏò§Î¨∏) ***Mother: Lady Jeong of the Jeong Clan (Ï†ïÎ∂ÄÏù∏ Ï†ïÏî®) ****Brother: Kim Jungeom (ÍπÄÏ§ëÏóÑ) *****Sister-in-law: Lady Cho of the Pyongyang Cho Clan (d.1450) (ÌèâÏñë Ï°∞Ïî®)Granddaughter of Taejong of Joseon.

He is best known for leading several raids on Jamaica before his capture. ==History== Grubing was English and Jamaica-born but sailed for the French after the outbreak of King William's War, as did many other English sailors ‚Äì Jacobites and Catholics, debtors, and privateers dissatisfied with England's discouragement of privateering. Jamaica's Governor Beeston wrote, ‚ÄúAmong the chief of these rogues was one Grubbin, who was born here of English parents, and who knowing every part of the Island had done much mischief by landing in the night, robbing lone settlements, and going away again before notice could be given to any force to oppose him.‚Äù In early 1692 Grubing raided Spanish River in Jamaica. Local authorities commissioned two armed sloops to chase Grubing and other French privateers and offered a reward for his capture. They soon commissioned a third sloop to sail after him and strengthened the island's fortifications. The sloops were unsuccessful and that September they ordered a fourth captain to command the efforts against Grubing, though insubordinate officers hampered his efforts. On Hispaniola in the summer of 1694 a Jamaican sloop took aboard Grubing's wife, who complained that he ‚Äúused her very ill.‚Äù On his next raid Grubing warned the Jamaicans to return her or ‚Äúhe would carry off every woman he met with till he had his wife again.‚Äù He made good on his threat, kidnapping a Major's wife and the 14-year- old daughter of a minister's widow. Beeston sent representatives to French Governor Du Casse to complain but the French ignored their flag of truce and captured Beeston's men as well. Finally in January 1697 an Englishman named Captain Moses apprehended several Frenchmen, Grubing among them. Beeston rewarded him handsomely. Du Casse demanded Grubing's return and threatened a captured English Captain named Price in return. Beeston was not swayed: ‚Äúthat shall not hinder me from causing Grubbin to suffer whatever the law may condemn him in, nor do I think that Mons. Ducasse will venture to do anything to an innocent man for the punishment of a criminal.‚Äù ==See also== *John Bear - another English pirate who switched sides, first aiding the Spanish, later the French. ==Notes== ==Further reading== *‚ÄùNo Quarter‚Äù, a series of fictionalized novels featuring Golden Age pirates, Grubing among them. ==References== Category:17th-century pirates Category:Year of birth missing Category:Year of death missing Category:French pirates Category:Caribbean pirates ","title":"Nathaniel Grubing"},{"id":"56692288","text":"Fier was a first-rate three-decker ship of the line of the French Royal Navy.

The north front is in three storeys, the remainder in two. There is a large 19th-century porch with Doric columns. In 1757 the house, then known as Heckfield House, and its surrounding estate was incorporated into the neighbouring estate of Stratfield Saye, then owned by the Pitt family. Highfield (or Heckfield) House was occupied around that time by General Sir William Augustus Pitt, who improved the building and its associated parkland. Ten years after his death in 1809 the house was renamed Highfield to avoid confusion with another Heckfield House nearby. For some years the house was residence of the Hon. General Sir Galbraith Lowry Cole, an army officer during the Peninsular war, and a personal friend of the Duke of Wellington. War Cabinet member and former Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain died of cancer in November 1940 whilst living in the house.

It is worth nothing that Mike Roman is not the same person as 3M CEO Mike Roman. ==Career== He began his career as a Republican Party activist in Philadelphia, his hometown. Early in his career Roman was a political consultant in his home state of Pennsylvania and in New Jersey. He was director of Election Day operations at the Republican National Committee. He has been employed by the George W. Bush, Rudy Giuliani and Sen. John McCain presidential campaigns. Roman also served as Chief of Staff to former Illinois Congressman Bobby Schilling. Roman was a senior advisor on the Trump Campaign and headed up the election integrity program. Prior to joining the Trump presidential campaign, Roman headed up an intelligence gathering operation for Charles and David Koch, industrialists and high-profile GOP donors. The office, now defunct, \\"conduct(ed) surveillance and intelligence gathering on... liberal opponents\\" of conservative policies. Roman describes his blog, Election Journal, as dedicated to \\"fraud, cheating, dirty tricks, absurdity and other election news.\\" According to Richard L. Hasen, Chancellor's Professor of Law and Political Science at the University of California, the blog appears to focus, \\"only on incidents favoring Republican's claims against Democrats. During the 2008 presidential election, Election Monitoring, combined GoogleMaps, with Twitter, Flickr and YouTube to enable voters and poll watchers to post what they saw as instances of voter disenfranchise- ment and election fraud in a real time, online map.

No members of this gens are mentioned in history, but several are known from inscriptions. ==Origin== As the Bellii are not mentioned by ancient writers, there are no traditions relating to the origin of this gens, and the nomen is not listed among the gentilicia for which Chase was able to ascribe a particular origin; it resembles other gentiles formed using the suffixes , -ellius, and -illius, frequently derived from cognomina ending in -ulus, but sometimes from words ending in -illus or -ellus.Chase, pp. 122‚Äì124. The root was probably bellus, handsome or beautiful, but the use of surnames such as Clemens and Pacatus by some members of this gens suggests that the name was associated with bellum, war. The nomen Duilius or Duellius was derived from an older form of bellum, and so might be a cognate of Bellius.Chase, p. 124. The nomen Bellienus seems to be derived from this gentilicium, which may give a clue to the geographical origin of the family, since the suffix -enus was common in names from Picenum and Umbria, and some of the inscriptions of the Bellii are from Pisaurum in Umbria.Chase, p. 118.New College Latin & English Dictionary, s.v. bellus, bellum. ==Praenomina== The main praenomina of the Bellii were Gaius, Marcus, Titus, and Numerius. The first three were very common throughout Roman history, while Numerius was somewhat more distinctive, and typical of the Roman countryside. The only other regular praenomen found among the Bellii was Lucius, perhaps the most abundant of all Roman names. Primus, given in the filiation of a Roman matron from Gallia Narbonensis, was an archaic praenomen, but in its masculine form it was little used in historical times, except as a surname, or in Cisalpine Gaul, where unusual praenomina were fashionable. It could have been the praenomen of the woman's father, but was more probably his surname. Suavis, given in another filiation, is not known as a praenomen, and may also have been the father's surname, but because one of the persons named in the same inscription was either a slave or freedwoman, it may be that the Suavis referred to had been a slave, or at least was not a Roman citizen, and so did not possess a regular praenomen. ==Branches and cognomina== There is no evidence that the Bellii were ever divided into distinct families. They used a variety of personal surnames, some of which belonged to freedmen, and were their original personal names. Other surnames included Belliolus, a diminutive of Bellius, evidently given to a little boy; Clemens, gentle, mild; Marcellinus, a diminutive of Marcellus, probably indicating that an earlier ancestor was named Marcellus; Pacatus, peaceful, calm; Plautus, given to someone with broad or flat feet; and Reginus, indicating someone who came from Rhegium.Chase, p. 110.New College Latin & English Dictionary, s.v. clemens, pacatus, Reginus. ==Members== * Bellia, inscribed on some pottery from the present site of Aventicum in Helvetia.Sylvestre, \\"Les graffitis sur c√©ramique d'Avenches\\", 23. * Bilia ∆Ü. l., a freedwoman named in an inscription from Rome.. * Belia Primi f., the wife of Marcus Vibius Campanus, buried at Nemausus in Gallia Narbonensis.. * Bellius, set up a monument at Catalaunum in Gallia Lugdunensis; perhaps the same Bellius named in inscriptions from Durocortorum and Bagacum in Gallia Belgica.CAG, li. 1, p. 317, 2, pp. 265, 311, 357. * Bellius, named in an inscription from Aquae Grani in Germania Inferior.. * Bilius, named in an inscription from Pompeii in Campania.. * Billius, the father of Parthenis, a young woman buried at Rome, with a monument from her father, her husband, Restitutus, and friend, Saturninus, aged twenty-three years, eight months, and fourteen days.. * Bellius Suavi f., the husband of Novia, named in an inscription found near Sch√∂nenberg- K√ºbelberg, formerly part of Germania Superior.. * Lucius Bilius T. f, buried at Pisaurum in Umbria, along with his brother, Titus, in a tomb built by Titus' wife, Rutilia Prima, dating to the late second or early third century.. * Marcus Bilius C. f., named in an inscription from Atria in Venetia and Histria.IIAdria, 17. * Titus Bilius T. f., the husband of Rutilia Prima, was buried at Pisaurum, together with his brother, Lucius, in a tomb built by Rutilia in the late second or early third century. * Numerius Billius N. l.

Don C did eventually make a men's size to include everyone. In 2018, Don C also collaborated with LVMH's R√©my Martin brand with \\"Just R√©my - The R√©my Martin 1738 Limited Edition\\". Much of the clothes of the Just Don brand is designed with sports logos such as teams from NBA, NHL, and MLS. One thing that Just Don is known for is his hats. He designs NBA, NHL, and MLS hats with snakeskin straps and snake skin bills. These hats are popular among celebrities notably Jay-Z. == Arrest == Don C and Kanye West were arrested in 2008 for getting into a fight with the paparazzi at LAX, where they ended up breaking a camera. They were charged with vandalism, grand theft, and battery. Both were sentenced to 50 hours of community service. If they had been convicted they could have ended up in jail and served a sentence up to 5 years. == References == Category:American fashion designers Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people ","title":"Don C"},{"id":"56692918","text":"alt=Photograph of Minnie Baldock by Colonel L. Blathwayt, the father of Photograph of Minnie Baldock by Colonel L. Blathwayt, the father of Mary Blathwayt. Lucy Minnie Baldock (20 November 18641939 England and Wales Register - 10 December 1954)England & Wales, National Probate Calendar (Index of Wills and Administrations), 1858-1966, 1973-1995 was a British suffragette. Along with Annie Kenney, she co-founded the first branch in London of the Women's Social and Political Union. ==Life and activism== Lucy Minnie Rogers was born in Bromley-by-Bow in 1864. She worked in sweated labour shirt factory and married Harry Baldock in 1888, and they had two children. The East End of London was known for its poor conditions and the Baldocks joined the Independent Labour Party (ILP) after the socialist Keir Hardie became their member of parliament in 1892. She worked with Charlotte Despard and Dora Montefiore. She took charge of the local unemployment Fund that was used to mitigate extreme hardship. Women were not then allowed to be a member of parliament, but the ILP chose her as their candidate to sit on the West Ham Board of Guardians in 1905. Baldock and Annie Kenney formed the first London branch (in Canning Town) of the then Manchester based Women's Social and Political Union in 1906, holding meetings at Canning Town Public Hall. Baldock attended 21 December 1905 pre-election meeting of the Liberals at the Royal Albert Hall dressed as a 'maid' to Annie Kenney (who wore a fur coat) and both sat in a box and Kenney hung a banner over the edge saying 'Votes for Women' and called out, resulting in a disturbance. The next day Baldock visited Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman with Kenney snd Teresa Billington to ask about when Liberals would deal with female suffrage, resulting in Dora Montefiore congratulating Baldock's 'noble stand' in a postcard. Baldock became a paid employee of the WSPU and a mentor to Daisy Parsons, and had a postal order for 30shillings from Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence to cover the costs of attending meetings in Long Eaton, Derbyshire. Speakers invited to address the Canning Town group included Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence, Annie Kenney and Flora Drummond. Baldock also organised and spoke at an open air meeting in Upton Park. Baldock was arrested on 23 October 1906 (along with Nellie Martel and Anne Cobden Sanderson) for disorderly conduct during the opening of Parliament. In 1907 she reported to the group on her visit to Jane Sbarborough in Holloway Prison when she heard about signalling between suffragettes, imprisoned at the same time, but not allowed to talk to each other. Baldock was also at the prison gate with Christabel Pankhurst to support Flora Drummond and others released to have a celebratory hotel breakfast. She also spoke in June 1907 at a Knightsbridge home event at the request of Louise Eates, Kensington WSPU and in August at a home in Kensington with Emmeline Pankhurst as noted by Sara Jessie Stephenson in her pamphlet No Other Way, In November 1907, Baldock was recording being ejected from a Liberal MP event on the Isle of Dogs but stood on a chair outside a window calling out \\"Votes for Women\\". In summer 1908 she was in Nottingham with Elsa Gye to build up its WSPU. In April 1909 she was with around 500 suffragettes at breakfast in Picadiily for Mrs Pethick-Lawrence's release from custody. == Arrest == Minnie Baldock with Christabel Pankhurst and Edith New (date unknown) Baldock was with twelve women who were arrested after walking single file through the streets towards the houses of commons with Mrs. Pankhurst in February 1908 \\"to present a petition from the Conference at Caxton Hall, and to the refusal of the authorities to treat suffragist offenders as first-class misdemeanants.\\" Baldock was arrested along with Mrs Pankhurst and others and was charged with resisting and obstructing the police. Baldock had to leave her two boys with their father whilst she served a month in jail and her fellow suffragettes assisted, including Maud Arncliff Sennett sending toys. Baldock got out a message published in Votes for Women 1 March 1908 p 82, that > \\"I love freedom so dearly that I want all women to have it, and I will fight > for it until they get it\\" In April that year, Emily Cobb, WSPU offered to sponsor the cost of a house help so that Baldock could be 'set free to do work you can do [ for the Cause] and many of us can not'. And in May Baldock was with Annie Kenney in Bristol , renting a house near the venue Augustine Birrell Liberal MP and Irish secretary of state, was to be speaking at, to help Elsie Howey and Vera Holme who hid overnight in the Hall to get into the event. In October 1909, Baldock was arrested again with Flora Drummond and the Pankhursts back at Clement's Inn. As a suffragette who had been to jail she was given the honour of planting a commemorative tree at Eagle House (suffragette's rest) in Somerset in February 1909. The house was the home of Mary Blathwayt's parents who supported the cause. Her father took commemorative photographs and afterwards he sent her flower plants in the following April for her garden. The following year Baldock spoke on Wimbledon Common, and had her travel paid by Minnie Turner, to support Mary Clarke campaigning in Brighton for a week in the summer . But in 1911, Baldock was diagnosed with cancer and she underwent surgery performed by Louisa Aldrich-Blake. Baldock recovered but broke contact with the increasingly militant WSPU. She did keep in contact with Edith How- Martyn and she was still a member of the Church League for Women's Suffrage and at the start of 1913 she and her family had to move to Liverpool for her sons to seek work in shipyards, although she and husband were also reported to be in Southampton in 1914 . Baldock took part in Emmeline Pankhurst's funeral, carrying the purple white and green colours (1928) and attended her statue unveiling in 1930. Baldock also supported How-Martyn in documenting the movement in the Suffragette Fellowship. She lived to be ninety and died in Poole in 1954. ==Posthumous recognition== Her name and picture (and those of 58 other women's suffrage supporters) are on the plinth of the statue of Millicent Fawcett in Parliament Square, London, unveiled in 2018. In 2011, Poole Museum and the National Lottery funds sponsored a short film on Baldock's life called The Right to Vote by Kate O'Malley starring Michelle O'Brien. == See also == * History of feminism * List of suffragists and suffragettes * Suffragette * Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom == References == ==External link== Category:British feminists Category:British suffragists Category:English feminists Category:English suffragists Category:Socialist feminists Category:1864 births Category:1954 deaths Category:Eagle House suffragettes Category:Women's Social and Political Union ","title":"Minnie Baldock"},{"id":"56692922","text":"Aljos Farjon (born 1946) is a Dutch botanist specialized in conifers.

He originally worked as the chief assistant for Masashi Kishimoto's manga series Naruto from 1999 to 2014. After its conclusion, Ikemoto was chosen to illustrate the 2016 sequel series, Boruto: Naruto Next Generations, working alongside writer Ukyo Kodachi. ==Biography and works== Boruto manga. As a child Ikemoto was a fan of Bikkuriman stickers. However, since he could not afford them, he instead drew his own stickers. Ikemoto's friends enjoyed them so much that they started buying stickers from him. By this point of his life, Ikemoto felt he had the talent for art. In March 1997, Mikio Ikemoto submitted his first one-shot manga, titled Cosmos, to the manga magazine Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump, for which he won a Tenkaichi Manga Award. The one-shot was later published in the July 7 issue of the magazine, gaining a small cult following despite its mature subject matter. Cosmos was then serialized in Monthly Plasma, an independent manga magazine, from June 1997 to September 1999, and a sequel one-shot was published in the April 26, 1999 issue of Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump. By this time Ikemoto had become interested in the work of fellow rookie manga artist Masashi Kishimoto. Upon hearing that Ikemoto had been contacted by Shueisha to work as an assistant on a comedy series and was moving to Tokyo, Kishimoto felt that his art would be wasted on that genre. With work beginning on the Naruto serialization, Kishimoto asked his editor, Kosuke Yahagi, to scout Ikemoto and recruit him as an assistant. Ikemoto was grateful for the offer, since he felt that Narutos genre was what he had originally wanted to work on, and accepted the job, beginning work with the seventh chapter. During the early days of making Naruto, Ikemoto was Kishimoto's youngest assistant, and the latter jokingly said this made him and his other assistants envious. Ikemoto's responsibilities included drawing crowds and background figures, adding white to speed lines, highlights and characters' eyes, whiting out art that went out of the panels, putting stars in night skies, and adding in half- tones. He was also occasionally tasked with creating the designs for new characters.https://www.shonenjump.com/mangaplus/sp/1902/interview_boruto/ Ikemoto recalls how often Kishimoto requested his help with adding more details to the manga chapters, leading him to draw more clones created by Naruto Uzumaki as well as an unspecified character who could become giant. When the manga ended in 2014, Shueisha asked Kishimoto to start a sequel. However, Kishimoto rejected the idea and proposed that Ikemoto draw it based on the experience he had. Kishimoto advised Ikemoto not to imitate his art style and instead make his own. While noting long-time fans might be disappointed with the fact that Kishimoto is not drawing Boruto, Ikemoto stated he would do his best in the making of the manga. Ikemoto mentioned he remained optimistic about his art style. Kishimoto also revises the manga's scenario. Besides illustrating the manga, Ikemoto also provides illustrations for the Boruto light novels. The manga had one million copies in print as of January 2017 while Studio Pierrot also produced an anime series based on it. ==Style== Aside from Naruto, Ikemoto said his art was influenced by Kinnikuman and particularly Dragon Ball. He noted that the lack of tone in Akira Toriyama's art makes drawing easier and said he still uses Dragon Ball as a reference for his own action scenes. Ikemoto admitted he is pretty bad at drawing comedy, but also noted that the way the story of Boruto has evolved does not lend itself well to comedy. While feeling honored to create the art for Boruto, Ikemoto stated he feels grateful that the series is released monthly rather than weekly due to the stress the latter could bring since the required amount of pages is nearly 20 per chapter. However, Ikemoto still finds the monthly serialization challenging. Regular chapters of Boruto tend to surpass 40 pages, with one week required to create the thumbnails and 20 days to produce the pages while the rest of the time is used for coloring or giving the chapters other touches. His drawing methods involve criterium (Mechanical Pencil) on IC's paper for the sketches. He uses ink for finished drawings. Despite the differences between their art styles, Ikemoto uses Copic's markers for the colored pages, similarly to how Kishimoto did with Naruto. The Boruto anime's director Hiroyuki Yamashita said he enjoys Ikemoto's style, praising his oblong landscape layout for frames. He found Ikemoto's style more realistic than Kishimoto's due to the former's attention to the character designs' details. He also pointed out that Ikemoto's way of illustrating Momoshiki Otsutsuki's new appearance after consuming Kinshiki Otsutsuki surprised him due to how different it was compared to the original design from the Boruto movie. Amy McNulty of Anime News Network shared similar comments, particularly regarding the way Ikemoto's art resembles Kishimoto's as well as how well-illustrated his fight scenes are. Manga author Yoshihiro Togashi stated he enjoyed Ikemoto's artwork, praising his style. ==References== == External links == Category:Japanese illustrators Category:Manga artists Category:1977 births Category:Living people ","title":"Mikio Ikemoto"},{"id":"56693402","text":"Lisyansky Peninsula (Russian: Poluostrov Lisyanskogo) is a mountainous peninsula in Khabarovsk Krai, Russian Federation.

He was beaten in three starts as a juvenile in 1905 but improved to become an exceptional racehorse in the following year. He won his first three races in 1906 before sustaining his only defeat of the season when finishing third in the Epsom Derby. He won his next five races including the Jersey Stakes and the Sussex Stakes before ending the year with a win in the St Leger. He remained in training at four but failed to win any major races although he did finish second in the Coronation Cup. After his retirement from racing he stood as a breeding stallion in Britain and the United States but was not a success at stud. ==Background== Troutbeck was a bay horse bred and owned by Hugh Grosvenor, 2nd Duke of Westminster at Eaton Hall in Cheshire. The colt was sent into training with William Waugh at the Kingsclere stable in Berkshire. Troutbeck was one of the best horses sired by Ladas who won the 2000 Guineas and the Epsom Derby in 1894. His dam Rydal Mount was a daughter of the influential broodmare Rydal whose other descendants have included Molvedo, Niniski, Belmez, Bellypha and Pearl Diver. ==Racing career== ===1905: two- year-old season=== Troutbeck ran three times as a two-year-old but failed to win or place although he showed somepromise when coming home fourth behind the filly Colonia in the Gimcrack Stakes at York Racecourse in August. ===1906: three-year-old season=== Troutbeck's owner Hugh Grosvenor, 2nd Duke of Westminster Troutbeck began his second season on 18 April at Newmarket Racecourse and recorded his first success by taking the 47th Newmarket Biennial Stakes. At Chester Racecourse in May the colt maintained his progress, winning two races including the Dee Stakes. On 30 May Troutbeck was one of twenty-two runners to contest the Epsom Derby over one and a half miles and started a 33/1 outsider. After disputing the lead from the start he went to the front in the straight but was outpaced in the closing stages and finished third behind Spearmint and Picton, beaten three and a half lengths by the winner. Shortly after winning the Duchess of York Plate at Hurst Park in June Troutbeck was dropped back in distance for the seven furlong Jersey Stakes Royal Ascot in which he was ridden by Herbert Jones and won at odds of 4/7. Less than a week later he won the Sandringham Plate at Sandown Park to record his third victory in the space of ten days. In August the colt won for the seventh time as he took the Sussex Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse at odds of 1/4, with Jones again in the saddle and then recorded yet another success in the City of London Breeders' Foal Plate at Kempton. On 12 September at Doncaster Racecourse Troutbeck, ridden by the French jockey Georges Stern, started at 5/1 for the 131st running of the St Leger over fourteen and a half furlongs. The filly Keystone II started the 5/4 favourite while the other runners included Gorgos, Plum Tree (Goodwood Cup), Beppo and th French colt Storm (third in the Grand Prix de Paris). The start of the race was very untidy and saw several horses left behind but Troutbeck responded quickly, went to the front, and opened up a clear advantage over his rivals. Troubeck still held the lead entering the straight but Beppo and Keystone were now close behind and the unconsidered outsider Prince William began tomake rapid progress along the inside rail. The closing stages saw a \\"desperate struggle\\" with Troutbeck prevailing by a head from Prince William,with Beppo and Keystone a head and a neck away in third and fourth. The finish of the race was extremely rough, with much bumping and barging between the first four horses, leading one observer to remark that it resembled \\"a combination of skittles and polo\\". Stern became the first French jockey to win one of the British Classic Races, while the winning time of 3:04.2 was a new record for the race. ===1907: four-year-old season=== Troutbeck remained in training as a four-year-old in 1907. In the Coronation Cup at Epsom in June he finished second to The White Knight with Polymelus in third. He faced The White Knight again in the Ascot Gold Cup over two and a half miles but finished unplaced. In July at Lingfield he was beaten by the three-year-old Wool Winder in a two- horse race for the valuable Lingfield Park Plate, conceding 24 pounds to the winner. He was retired from racing shortly afterwards. ==Assessment and honours== In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Troutbeck an \\"inferior\\" winner of the St Leger. ==Stud record== Troutbeck began his stud career in England at an initial advertised fee of ¬£49. After standing for several years in England he was sold for 460 guineas in 1917 and was exported to the United States in January 1920. He had little success as a sire of winner in either location. Troutbeck died in 1930. ==Pedigree== ==References== Category:1903 racehorse births Category:1930 racehorse deaths Category:Racehorses bred in the United Kingdom Category:Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom Category:Thoroughbred family 16-b Category:St Leger winners ","title":"Troutbeck (horse)"},{"id":"56693415","text":"Los miserables or Los Miserables may refer to: * Los miserables (1973 TV series) * Los miserables (2014 TV series) *Los Miserables (band), a Chilean punk rock band ","title":"Los miserables"},{"id":"56693425","text":"Wivels Forlag was a publishing house operated by Ole Wivel from 1945-54 in Copenhagen, Denmark.

It results from eating raw salmon, trout, or salamander and is common in the Pacific Northwest. These fish and amphibians are infected with the larvae of a fluke, Nanophyetus salmincola through an intermediate host, the snail Oxytrema plicifer. The larvae attaches to the intestine of the dog and the rickettsial bacteria are released, causing severe gastrointestinal disease and systemic infection. Neorickettsia elokominica, carried by the same fluke, causes a similar disease known as Elokomin fluke fever (EFF) in canids, bears, raccoons, and ferrets. ==Symptoms== Symptoms of SPD begin about one week after eating the salmon and include vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite, depression, high fever, and enlarged lymph nodes. Untreated, mortality reaches 90 percent. Death occurs seven to ten days after symptoms begin. EFF has less severe symptoms than SPD, with less gastrointestinal signs and more lymph node involvement. The mortality in untreated cases is about 10 percent. A similar disease has been identified in Brazil. ==Diagnosis== Diagnosis is through finding the fluke eggs microscopically in a stool sample. A needle aspiration biopsy of an enlarged lymph node will reveal rickettsial organisms within macrophages in many cases. The rickettsial infection can be successfully treated with tetracycline, and the fluke infection can be treated with fenbendazole. ==References== Category:Rickettsiales Category:Bacteria described in 1953 Category:Dog diseases ","title":"Neorickettsia helminthoeca"},{"id":"56693569","text":"Poker Night in America (PNIA) is a poker television program which features cash games and sit & gos.

The programme was discontinued after a change in government. The idea of BLP originated at a workshop organized by Maryam Babangida with the scope of discussing the relegation of rural women in discourse affecting national development and the invisibility of positive actions towards causes favoring rural women. When the project started, the objectives were to reduce maternal and child mortality rate by increasing basic healthcare facilities for women, provide income-generating opportunities in agriculture and cottage industries, integrate rural women into national development plans and develop educational training for women. However, the programme provoked criticism because funds allocated to many projects were unaccounted for largely because there was no budgetary allocation to fund BLP. Access to government funds by a first lady was challenged as unconstitutional and some critics view the project as a means to increase the personality of the first lady. ==The Programme== Prior to the launch of Better Life, Maryam Babangida held consultations with various stakeholders such as the Directorate for Food and Rural Infrastructure and women organizations about economic and social constraints affecting rural women. In 1986, she visited two villages close to Lagos, Igbologun and Ilado-Odo. The villages did not have clean water and power distribution infrastructure. The visit confirmed her understanding that more actions should be directed towards rural development. In 1987, a workshop on the role of rural women in development was held in Abuja and led to the establishment of BLP. ===Projects=== BLP focused on key areas of nutrition, education, agriculture. ====Agriculture==== BLP created strategies that mobilized some rural women farmers to produce affordable food crops that has nutritional and national development values such as Cassava for starch production and grain produce. Women farmers were encouraged to unite under cooperative societies to increase access to credit and land grants, extension services and technology. The programme introduced basic farm and mechanized inputs such as cutlasses and subsidized tractor for hire service. Food processing machines were also made available to women farmers. ====Education==== A strategy to increase literacy and the agriculture know-how of rural women was adult literacy programmes tailored to functional and vocational subject areas such as dress making, knitting and mathematics. ====Healthcare==== BLP mobilized the provision of primary health care centers close to rural settlements. It mobilized women to get immunizations, established small pharmacies and trained mid-wives and provided VVF centers. The programme was also involved in extending family planning services to rural women and providing education about health and safety issues concerning child marriage and sexually transmitted diseases. ==Organizational structure== After the launch of BLP, wives of military governors were tasked to understand the plight of rural women in their specific states and create projects that will benefit rural women and linking such projects to the appropriate state ministry. A committee under the headship of the wife of the military governor, that included a director-general and leading female government employees managed and implemented BLP projects in each state. From 1987 to 1993, BLP did not legally have access to any budgetary allocation and critics queried the source of funding for many of its projects. Many wives of governors advertised their projects in newspapers and when attending conferences stayed at choice hotels. Many of these actions provoked a debate about the constitutional authority of a wife of a military president and access to state funds. ==References== Category:Women in Nigeria Category:1987 establishments in Nigeria ","title":"Better Life Programme for Rural Women"},{"id":"56693588","text":"Lombardic capitals in a manuscript (the Ambraser Heldenbuch, fol. 75v, c.1516) Lombardic capitals is the name given to a type of decorative upper-case letters used in inscriptions and, typically, at the start of a section of text in medieval manuscripts.

Reynolds was active in farming politics, serving as chairman of the Longford branch of the Irish Farmers' Association (IFA) from 1999 to 2003 and subsequently as treasurer of the Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers' Association (ICSA) until 2017. He co-founded the National Party with Justin Barrett in November 2016. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the party at the 2020 Irish general election, standing in the Longford-Westmeath constituency. == Farming activism == === Irish Farmers' Association === Reynolds was elected chairman of Longford IFA branch in 1999, a position which he held until 2003. He then chaired his local Ballinalee IFA branch. He was a staunch critic of IFA president P√°draig Walshe. At the 2006 Ploughing Championships in Tullow, Reynolds organised up to twenty posters depicting Walshe with then-Minister for Agriculture Mary Coughlan in his arms with the words \\"Beet this\\" printed above them to be placed at various routes to the ploughing site. This referred to Walshe's supposed role in the demise of the Irish sugar industry. In 2009 Reynolds and other disgruntled IFA farmers formed Farmers For No to oppose the second Lisbon Treaty referendum. They claimed the Lisbon Treaty would fast- track Turkey's application to join the EU, which would \\"double the number of farmers overnight\\" and cause Common Agricultural Policy payments to collapse. They further claimed that the passage of the Treaty would \\"jeopardise\\" farm succession rights. The second Lisbon Treaty referendum subsequently passed by a margin of 67% to 33%. Farmers For No was revived in 2012 to oppose the Fiscal Compact treaty in that year's referendum. Reynolds caused a stir on an episode of RT√â's Frontline debating the Treaty, in which he provoked the host Pat Kenny by suggesting that a Yes vote would \\"shut down rural Ireland\\" to which Kenny responded, \\"come on James, get a life.\\" The incident prompted Reynolds to be labelled \\"a YouTube sensation\\" by the Irish Times. He was suspended by the IFA in 2012 for bringing the county executive \\"into disrepute\\". === Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers' Association === In 2014, he was elected for a two-year term as national treasurer of the ICSA, having previously served as its secretary. During his time as ICSA treasurer he said the organisation was \\"unique in being the only farm organisation to call for the appointment of an EU-wide regulator for the meat industry\\". In response to Reynolds' role in co-founding the National Party he was removed from his position as national treasurer of the ICSA by a vote of no confidence passed by the organisation's executive. Reynolds rejected the legitimacy of the executive's decision to expel him and said he believes he should not be discriminated against for his political views. He launched an appeal against the decision to remove him as national treasurer. Justice Robert Haughton granted Reynolds a temporary injunction preventing the ICSA from removing him from his position. Ultimately, the High Court ruled in favour of the ICSA against Reynolds and his expulsion was confirmed. The ICSA also objected to Reynolds' \\"gratuitously offensive comments made about the former Taoiseach Enda Kenny, the EU Commissioner and other politicians‚Äù. == Political activism == Reynolds (left) with fellow National Party general election candidates Paul McWeeney and Paul Hanley. Reynolds contested the Longford County Council election in 2004 as an independent, leaving his post of Longford IFA chairman to do so. He received 231 first preference votes and failed to be elected, being eliminated on the fourth count. The same year Justin Barrett campaigned unsuccessfully for a seat in the European Parliament. In 2009, Reynolds became chairman of the Longford branch of Libertas Ireland, a political party founded by Declan Ganley. Reynolds campaigned on behalf of Ganley's unsuccessful attempt to be elected an MEP. In November 2009, Libertas Ireland was removed from the Register of Political Parties in Ireland. Reynolds' next foray into politics was as chair of the eurosceptic Farmers For No campaign, established to oppose the 2009 Lisbon Treaty referendum. The group was briefly revived to oppose the 2012 Compact Fiscal referendum, Reynolds claimed the treaty would put the Common Agricultural Policy budget \\"at severe risk\\". In November 2016 he helped to co-found the National Party and assumed the post of vice president of the new party. Reynolds has spoken at a number of National Party events since the party's launch, including alongside Barrett who has described Reynolds as a \\"friend for many years\\". At the party's first ardfheis, guest speaker John Wilson walked out in reaction to homophobic comments, including a claim by Reynolds that LGBT people were \\"mentally disordered\\". In June 2019, Reynolds accompanied anti-immigration and conspiracy-theorist campaigner Gemma O'Doherty for a livestream in Longford, during which a Polish woman living in the town confronted the pair outside St. Mel's Cathedral. Reynolds subsequently spoke in O'Doherty's favour during protests held outside Google's Dublin headquarters following her suspension from YouTube. Local independent County Councillor Turlough McGovern denied political association with Reynolds after the county council elections in 2019, when Reynolds was photographed celebrating with him. McGovern has since denied support of or by Reynolds and that any involvement from Reynolds was \\"in a personal capacity\\".https://www.longfordleader.ie/news/home/422010/newly-elected- longford-councillor-turlough-pott-mcgovern-denies-involvement-with-james- reynolds.html Reynolds was an unsuccessful candidate in Longford-Westmeath in the 2020 general election, garnering 983 first preference votes (1.74%). == References == Category:1968 births Category:Irish farmers Category:People from County Longford Category:Living people Category:Irish far-right politicians ","title":"James Reynolds (Irish politician)"},{"id":"56693883","text":"Beat the World (also known as You Got Served: Beat the World) is a 2011 Canadian dance film written and directed by Robert Adetuyi.

Paula Citron of The Globe and Mail found the film to be predictable and the dance sequences to be over- edited, commenting: \\"... if the audience is not there for the story - which is clearly just a hat to hang the dance on - they must be there for the dance. Unfortunately, because Adetuyi's film is actually one very long music video, the dance portions are shot in 30-second bites, so one never gets a sense of an entire routine. All we get is fast-cut teasers.\\" In his review for NOW Toronto, Norman Wilner criticised the acting skills of the accomplished dancers and found the plot to be hackneyed, concluding:\\" ... It's all just atrociously acted filler between the dance sequences, which Adetuyi shoots so haphazardly that it's impossible to appreciate the artists or choreography.\\" Bruce DeMara, reviewing for the Toronto Star found the plot, dialogue and theme of beating the world to be clich√©d. He praised the dance performances but criticised their editing. He concluded: \\" ... there are a couple of decent performances that shine through, notably Brown as Yuson and Ray Johnson as his friend, Easy, both of whom have solid onscreen presence but need a better film to demonstrate it in. Adetuyi has the makings of a decent filmmaker. He just needs to stick to the basics: believable dialogue and characters and a storyline that takes a few chances.\\" ==References== ==External links== * Category:2011 films Category:Canadian films Category:English-language films Category:American dance films Category:American films Category:Canadian musical drama films Category:Hip hop dance Category:2010s hip hop films Category:2010s musical drama films Category:American musical drama films Category:Films directed by Robert Adetuyi Category:Films scored by Andrew Lockington Category:2011 drama films Category:Sony Pictures direct-to-video films ","title":"Beat the World"},{"id":"56693899","text":"Daisy Eris Campbell (born 1978), is a British writer, actress and theatre director.

Its chief geographical features are small streams, spring wells and dug wells. Tawnagh is traversed by the L5028 public road and rural lanes. The townland covers 150 statute acres. ==History== The 1609 Ulster Plantation Baronial Map depicts the townland as part of Gortatawill.National Archives Dublin (Irish name, either Gort an Tuathail meaning 'The field facing away from the Sun' or Gort an Eochaille meaning \\"The Field of the Yew Wood\\".) The 1665 Down Survey map depicts Tawnagh as Dawnagh.Trinity College Dublin: The Down Survey of Ireland. In the Plantation of Ulster by grant dated 29 April 1611, King James VI and I granted the town and lands of Gortatowill containing 6 polls, comprising a total of 300 acres at an annual rent of ¬£3-4s., to Mulmore McHugh McFarrall O'Rely, gent. Mulmore O'Reilly had been dispossessed of his lands in the townland of Aghaweely Lower in the parish of Ballintemple. He was the grandson of the chief of the O'Reilly clan, Fearghal mac Sea√°n, who ruled East Breifne from 1526‚Äì1534.

He also had an illegitimate son, Cathaoir. Mulmore died sometime between 1611 and 1637. He left his lands in Tawnagh to his son √âmonn (Edmund) O'Reilly. √âmonn had three sons, Aodh (Hugh), Cathal and Brian. An Inquisition held in Cavan Town on 12 September 1638 found that the said Edm‚Äô Relly recently of Gortetowell in Co.

Hugh O‚ÄôReyly, his son and heir has reached his maturity and now holds the land from the king in free and common socage. Catherine Newgent, alias Reily, was the wife of the said Edmund and the aforesaid Catherine is dower of the premises. At the outbreak of the Irish Rebellion of 1641 Hugh O'Reilly still held the townland according to the Books of Survey and Distribution. Hugh O'Reilly had two sons, √âmonn and Phillip. Hugh's son √âmonn had one son S√©mus. The aforesaid O‚ÄôReilly lands in Tawnagh were confiscated in the Cromwellian Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652.

By grant dated 11 September 1670 from King Charles II of England to said Sir Tristram Beresford, the said lands of Downagh were included in the creation of a new Manor of Beresford. Beresford then leased the land to John Graham. On 13 March 1706 Marcus Beresford, 1st Earl of Tyrone leased the land of Downagh to Robert Saunders (Irish lawyer), one of the founders of the village of Swanlinbar, for a term of 99 years.

The purpose of the base was to set up a force that could operate behind German lines in case of an allied invasion of Norway. If it came under attack, the force was supposed to either withdraw to the mountains along Sognefjorden, or be evacuated by the navy. The force received its supplies by the sea as well as from the air.

According to some historic documents, Rei Emadir was \\"a slave\\" who avoided slavery and mobilized all the Angolares along with other Africans and made a free nation under the middle of the mentioned islands.Rei Amador. ==History of the origin of the Angolars== The Angolars inhabited the south of the island of S√£o Tom√©, there are different versions on the history . The first source on the Angolars, which were African slaves where brought from the mainland, probably from Angola who survived a shipwreck that happened about 2‚Äì3 miles (4 km) in the south coast of S√£o Tom√© Island. Another version was that the Angolars were African slaves who had evaded their owners around 1470, when the Portuguese discovered the islands of S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe and have created their own free nation within the islands called Kilombo or Quilombo. The name Kilombo or Quilombo derives from (Kimbundo one of the most spoken Bantu languages in Angola), it can mean a settlement kingdom, population and union. Kilombo was an independent nation made by African slaves, who fought against slavery, once they fled, build their independent state with the system of slavery, The Kilombos, in general were localized in its regions densely forested, far from the plantations. A third version, was that the Angolars were Africans which were immigrated from the mainland to the islands of S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe, long before the arrivals of the Portuguese into the islands. However, the very particular remains inhistory of the Angolars and their reign in S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe are part of a history of self-determination and independence carried out by Rei Amador. ==Slave rebellion== On 9 July 1595, Rei Amador, and his people, the Angolars, allied with other enslaved Africans of its plantations, marched into the interior woods and battled against the Portuguese. It is said that day, Rei Amador and his followers raised a flag in front of the settlers and proclaimed Rei Amador as king of S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe, making himself as \\"Rei Amador, liberator of all the black people\\". Between 1595 and 1596, the island of S√£o Tom√© was ruled by the Angolars, under the command of Rei Amador. On 4 January 1596, he was captured, sent to prison and was later executed by the Portuguese. Still today, they remember him fondly and consider him a national hero of the islands. ==Legacy== *In S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe, January 4 was declared a holiday in his honour, first celebrated in 2005. *A football (soccer) club known as UDRA is named after him.A Verdadeira Origem do C√©lebre Rei Amador Gerhard Seibert of Espa√ßo Cultural STP *Rei Amador was depicted in a 5,000 dobras note.

Bellienus is the form that occurs in writers, while Billienus is more common in inscriptions. Members of this gens are first mentioned toward the end of the Republic. Lucius Bellienus obtained the praetorship in 107 BC, but was prevented from obtaining the consulship. The Bellieni occur in history down to the time of Caesar, after which the family faded into obscurity; but others are known from inscriptions. ==Origin== Cicero refers to a Gaius Annius Bellienus, and from this it has been inferred that Bellienus might be a cognomen of the Annia gens; but even if this Bellienus or some of the others mentioned in history are correctly identified as Annii, the evidence from inscriptions demonstrates that Bellienus was a separate nomen gentilicium. The name belongs to a class of gentilicia formed using the suffix -enus, frequently found in Picenum and Umbria. Such names were typically derived from other gentilicia, rather than from place names, as was the case with the similar gentile-forming suffix -anus; in this case probably Bellius, also found as Billius, Belius, and Bilius.Chase, p. 118. ==Praenomina== The main praenomina of the Bellieni were Lucius, Gaius, and Marcus. Other names occur infrequently, including one instance of the Oscan praenomen Salvius, appearing in the filiation of one of the family. ==Branches and cognomina== The Bellieni do not seem to have been divided into distinct families. They used a number of personal surnames, including Niger and Rufus, referring to black or red hair, respectively; Dexter, literally \\"right-handed\\", but figuratively \\"lucky\\" or \\"skilled\\"; Genialis, \\"genial\\"; and Vitalis, \\"vital\\". Actiacus was assumed by a soldier who had fought at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC. Messor, the name of another soldier, refers to one who reaps or mows.New College Latin & English Dictionary, s. v. dexter, genialis messor, niger, rufus, vitalis. Several women of this gens bore Secunda or Tertia as surnames; these were old praenomina that gradually came to be treated as cognomina, typically being placed at the end of the name, although they retained their original individualizing function.Chase, p. 172.Kajava, Roman Female Praenomina. ==Members== * Lucius C. f. Bellienus, praetor in 107 BC, served under Gaius Marius in the war against Jugurtha and Bocchus. He is probably the same person as the Gaius Bellienus who was prevented from obtaining the consulship by the repeated selection of Marius. Cicero describes him as an accomplished orator, and learned in the law.Sallust, Bellum Jugurthinum, 104.Cicero, Brutus, 47.Broughton, vol.

Shortly after its predecessor, the Western Maryland Democrat, ceased publication due to violence from an angry mob in the aftermath of the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, former publisher William H. Davis established the Advocate in 1865. About a year later, Davis turned over operations to Joseph M. Parke, a lawyer and Democratic office holder. After gaining control of the paper, Parke published the following promise: \\"We promise to the down trodden people of Maryland our best efforts in their cause, and our firm adhesion to the principles of the great Conservative National Party now rising, whose mission it will be, under the providence of God, to sweep from power every distracting element which stands in the way of a speedy restoration of our whole country to its former united and happy condition.\\" In 1868, William H. Vanderford assumed control of the Advocate and installed his father, Henry Vanderford, in the position of editor. Henry Vanderford was an experienced newspaperman who had previously published the Cecil Democrat in the 1840s. The proprietorship of the paper changed slightly in 1878, with William's younger brother Charles Vanderford joining the team as co-editor. Charles also had previous newspaper experience - both with Middletown, Delaware's Middletown Transcript and with Harrisonburg, Virginia's Old Commonwealth. Charles Vanderford died in 1906, and his father William bought his son's interest in the paper and formed The Democratic Advocate Company. With this change, the paper again published a solemn promise to its readers, affirming, \\"The paper will, as heretofore, be distinctively a Democratic newspaper, upholding and promoting, as far as it may be able, the principles of the Democratic party. It will be conducted upon the broad and conservative lines of a Democratic paper desiring to serve the entire party. It will in no way seek to promote the political interests of individuals, nor interfere, in any way, with the free expression of the will of the Democrats of our county in the choice of candidates for public office.\\" The Historical Society of Carroll County notes that Dr. J. Howard Billingslea was president of The Democratic Advocate Company while William H. Vanderford was editor. His successor Edward Diffendal acted as editor from 1906 to 1960, when Virginia Minnick took over as managing editor. The final issue of the paper was published on December 26, 1968, after which the Advocate was purchased by the Carroll County Times and published as the Advocate-Times until September 25, 1972. In terms of political tone, the Democratic Advocate, though staunchly Democratic, reflected the increasingly mundane political interests of the citizens of Carroll County. The Carroll County Agricultural Society opened a new fairgrounds and race track in 1869, placing emphasis on the importance of farming to the area's economy. Milling was an especially profitable enterprise, so when in 1872 a prominent local miller was murdered, the community followed the trials, appeals, and eventual execution of the murderer Joseph Davis in the Advocate as well as its rival paper, the American Sentinel. == References == Category:Defunct newspapers published in Maryland Category:1865 establishments in Maryland Category:1968 establishments in Maryland Category:1972 disestablishments in Maryland Category:Westminster, Maryland ","title":"The Democratic Advocate"},{"id":"56694211","text":"Mariadas Kagithapu (7 September 1936 - 26 February 2018) was a Roman Catholic archbishop.

Mazaetullus had married the widow of Oezalces, a Carthaginian, which earned him the support of at least a part of the Punic aristocracy concerned perhaps from this time to remove Masinissa from power, although he has until then faithfully served the interests of Carthage fighting under Hasdrubal's orders in Spain.

He entered the University of Chile, where he received the institution's award for the best graduate in 1935. He obtained his law degree in 1937, with a report entitled Ensayo de una teor√≠a general de los actos inoponibles. As a student, he worked first in the law school library (1930‚Äì1932) and later as secretary of the school's director (1932‚Äì1934). Baltra specialized in economics, and in 1935 he became the founder and first director of his alma mater's School of Commerce and Economics. He then taught university and wrote several books on economics. In 1937 he joined the Radical Party, and under the government of Juan Antonio R√≠os, in 1942, he was appointed general director of the Ministry of Economy and Commerce. During the first year of the presidency of Gabriel Gonz√°lez Videla, he was appointed undersecretary of Economy and Commerce, and the following year, in 1947, minister of the sector, a position he held until 1950. In 1948 he became the first president of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (CEPAL), and led Chile's delegations to the conferences of this organization in Havana (1949), Montevideo (1950), and Mexico (1951). Later he would be a consultant to CEPAL. In 1952 he was appointed vice president of the (COVENSA), and from 1956 to 1958 he was an advisor to the Comptroller General of the Republic. He also became general director of Madeco in 1957. He held several leading positions in the Radical Party, becoming national president in 1958. In the complementary elections of 1968 he was elected senator for the eighth provincial group of B√≠o B√≠o, Malleco, and Caut√≠n, replacing the late Jos√© Garc√≠a Gonz√°lez (PDC). Baltra narrowly defeated (PADENA), 58,050 votes to 57,284. (PN) came third with 35,949. For the election he received the support of the Popular Action Front parties, in what was one of the first rapprochements of radicalism with the rest of the leftist forces. The following year he was a candidate for the presidency of Chile for the Radical Party, which was part of Popular Unity, and the latter eventually elected the candidate Salvador Allende. Baltra, who had been on the left wing of the Radical Party and was president of the Chilean-Soviet Culture Institute, resisted the course his political group was taking during the Allende government. Finally ‚Äì along with other well-known politicians such as ‚Äì he ended up renouncing it on 3 August 1971 and, the same day, forming the Independent Left Radical Movement. Later that year this became the Radical Left Party (PIR). The new group was originally part of Popular Unity, but it later abandoned this alliance and was critical of the Allende government. For the parliamentary elections of March 1973, the PIR joined with other center- right opposition parties in the Confederation of Democracy, formed in July 1972, and Baltra ran for Senator for Santiago, but received only 1.92% of the vote. Baltra wrote several works on economics, some of which were awarded and used as textbooks at the University of Chile. He was a professor there, and among his disciples was the future president Ricardo Lagos, who was his assistant. He was a member of the Chilean Academy of Social, Political, and Moral Sciences. In 1940 he married the lawyer Adriana Olgu√≠n, who would be the first female minister in Latin America to occupy the Justice portfolio under Gonz√°lez Videla. The couple had one son, Luis Alberto Baltra Olgu√≠n. Alberto Baltra died on 20 September 1981, the victim of a cardiac arrest while walking down Antonio Varas Street near his house in the district of Providencia. ==Works== * Crecimiento econ√≥mico de Am√©rica Latina.

Projectiles can be launched at approximately 4,500 miles per hour using magnetic fields. These new weapons are allowing the military to eliminate explosives where possible. It is being used by the Navy as well for its ability to be effective and affordable. The Navy is working on modernizing their weapons, including nuclear weapons. Two weapons on the list to work on creating are a \\"low-yield warhead for submarine-launched ballistic missiles\\" and a \\"nuclear capable submarine-launched cruise missile\\". The U.S. Army is using Weapons Systems Engineering to help protect our soldiers. They have designed a Humvee to be equipped to contain a gun with an automated tracking system. This would be controlled by another soldier or a computer program. This along with other new systems, vehicles, etc. is all possible because of the new advancements in Weapon Systems Engineering. In May the Army will test out automated Humvee's to certify them as combat ready vehicles. According to the Army Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC) this is the first step toward weaponized robotics.

He was a participant of the Spanish Civil War, political instructor of the Jose Palafox battalion and commander of the Ukrainian interbrigade company Taras Shevchenko. == Biography == Mikalai Dvornikau was born on 7 December 1907, in Gomel in a working-class family. Since 1926 he worked on swamps draining, at the construction sites of the bridge over the Sozh river, and the Palace of Culture of Railway Workers, was a worker of the agricultural machinery plant \\"Gomselmash\\". Since 1927 he was a member of the Belarusian Komsomol, since 1929 was a member of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks). In 1928‚Äì1929 he was the secretary of the Komsomol organization of the Gomselmash plant; in 1929‚Äì1931 was the secretary of a district committee of the Komsomol. Since January 1931 he was a member of the Central Committee of the Belarusian Komsomol. === Underground in Western Belarus === In 1932, Dvornikau attended the Party School courses organized by the Central Committee of the CPWB in Minsk, and then since November 1932 was sent to underground work to Western Belarus (controlled by the Second Polish Republic), appointed as the Secretary of the Bialystok, and then the Brest Regional Committee of the illegal Western Belarusian Komsomol. In May‚ÄìJuly 1933, in the forests near Brest, under Dvornikau's leadership, a conference of the Brest Regional Committee of the CPWB took place. It was decided to launch mass protests of the peasants of the Brest region; a campaign of mass peasant actions against landlords was approved. Dvornikau became one of the organizers of the peasants' armed uprising on 3‚Äì4 August in Kobry≈Ñ district, which was brutally suppressed, and ended with pacification actions and arrests. Dvornikau launched a mass national-wide campaign in support of the communists sentenced to death for participation in the uprising. As a result, they succeeded in softening of the sentence. In November 1933, he was co-opted to the Central Committee Secretariat of the CPWB and started his work in Wilno. Since October 1935, he continues his activities in Poland as the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Western Belarusian Komsomol.

The action took place on 27 January 1935, during Strelchuk was giving his testimony at the trial against a group of 17 revolutionaries in Wilno. Dvornikau was the backup of the main executor Siarhei Prytytski. After the police had attempted to arrest him, Dvornikau wounded a policeman and run away. === Civil War in Spain === From 1936 to 1938, Dvornikau fought in the fronts of the Spanish Civil War on the Republican side. Under the pseudonym Staislav Tomashevich he served as a political instructor in the Jose Palafox Battalion, which was a part of the XIII Dombrowski International Brigade. Since the end of 1937 he was the first commander of the Ukrainian interbrigade company Taras Shevchenko, where the Ukrainian and Belarusian communists from Poland and other countries served.

The river is located near the capital of the Central African Republic, Bangui. == Description == It is a small tributary off the Oubangui river, which is a tributary off the larger Congo River. The Mpoko River covers 23,900 km2 of land area and 86% savanna cover. It begins on the Oubangui River near the capital, Bangui, and flows northwest. It drains a savanna dominated ecosystem. == History surrounding Mpoko River == Starting in 1899, the French gave land commissions in the French Congo to 39 companies. The companies had to pay royalties to France and their main objective was the collection of rubber and ivory. One concessionary company called the \\"La Mpoko\\" was founded on July 10, 1899 with the intention of exploiting a concession that covered the basin of the Mpoko River and the other tributaries. Guilbrand Schi√∂tz was appointed head of the company in Bimbo, in 1906 Gaston Guibet was appointed head. The chief of the Bouriki peoples came to Guibet with a complaint, armed company men were demanding more rubber in his village and committing violent crimes. In 1907 Guibet reported to the local judicial authorities the crimes committed by agents under La Mpoko. The agents would take women as hostages demanding certain rubber quotas and beat and kill many people for no apparent reason. Agents stationed there would often rape women while the men were away at work. Schi√∂tz resigned and left Africa in 1907 right as Guibet began to start an investigation. The French Congo high commissioner √àmile Gentil asked Paris to shut La Mpoko down but was rejected and the minister in Paris claimed that legal procedures against the company's clients had to be completed first. On April 29, 1909 a persecutor in Brazzaville gave a verdict that relieved the company and clients of their crimes. Due to its bad reputation the La Mpoko concession was revoked in 1910 and the company was liquidated in February 1911. == Turbidity == The Mpoko river was found to have high TSM levels around 78.0 mg L‚àí1 contrasting from the low levels ranging around 0.7‚Äì16.0 mg L‚àí1 from more rainforest dominated rivers. TSM levels, standing for total suspended matter, depict how clear the water is in a river. Due to the surrounding savanna ecosystem, the water quality of the Mpoko River is highly turbid and not recommended for drinking. == References == Category:Tributaries of the Ubangi River Category:Rivers of the Central African Republic ","title":"Mpoko River"},{"id":"56694771","text":"Margrit Gertsch (born 13 December 1939) is a Swiss alpine skier.

Gad on 31 October 1855 when Gottlieb Ernst Clausen Gad established a combined book shop and publishing house on Vimmelskaftet in Copenhagen. He had spent the previous 10 years working for Gtldendal, first as an apprentice and later as an assistant. The following year he became a partner in Forlagsbureauet i K√∏benhavn alongside Gyldendal, C. G. Iversen, Lose & Delbanco. Gad, who had good connections at the University of Copenhagen, specialized in scientific and other nonfictional literature. His book shop was the last book shop to be awarded the title of university book shop in 1882. Another early focus area of his publishings was Norwegian and Swedish literature. In 1783, he bought out the last co-owner of Forlagsbureuet i Kj√∏benhavn and merged it into his company. Gad's book shop at Vimmelskaftet 32 pauinted by Alfred Larsen in 1930 In 1897, G. E. C. Gad purchased a new building at Vimmelskaftet 32, not far from its old headquarters. Gad's two sons, Oscar and Frederik Gad, were made partners in the company that same year. Their father served as president of the Danish Booksellers Association in 1897-1902. Frederik Gad became the sole owner of the company following his father's death in 1906 and his elder brother's death in 1920. Kay Lynnerup (1925-1990) was appointed to CEO of the company in 19956.

At this point the chain consisted of 16 bookshops. Lars Ive (born 1951) succeeded Frederik Christiansen as CEO of the chain on 1 April 2003.

Attending Hunter's Prep School alongside her classmates Mavis, Reina, and Pauline, Adele tries her best to live her life as normally as possible, which does not prove to be an easy feat. ==Characters== ; / : : The central character, Adele is a twelve-year-old girl with long silver hair. She was originally an intelligent Japanese girl named , who was unable to make friends due to the expectations placed upon her. After losing her life while saving a girl from an oncoming truck, she was offered the chance to be reincarnated into a fantasy world, asking only that she would be given \\"average\\" abilities so she can live a normal life. After regaining her memories at the age of ten, Adele discovered that her abilities, which are the average of all magical creatures in the world, are 6,800 times more powerful than an average human, giving her excessive physical strength and powerful magic. After failing to hide her abilities at Eckland Academy, she left her home country and took on the alias of \\"Mile\\" to attend Hunter's Prep School, where she forms a party named . She loves anime, manga, and video games, the knowledge of which she uses in her new life in very interesting ways. She has a boob complex, which provokes her anger when someone points it out. ; : : Also known as Crimson Reina, she is a mage specializing in fire magic. She was born to a traveling merchant, and became a Hunter at an early age, giving her the most practical knowledge and experience amongst the Crimson Vow party members. She has a signature fire spell called Crimson Hellfire, and has a particular hatred for bandits after both her father and a Hunter group who had taken her in after his death were killed by such brigands. Despite being fifteen years old at the start of the series, she is assumed to be a similar age to Mile, the youngest member of their group, due to her height and appearance which is a source of annoyance for her. ; : : The official leader of the Crimson Vow (although it is always Reina that does the actual \\"leading\\"), Mavis is a 17-year-old swordswoman of noble birth. After running away from home in the hopes of becoming a knight, she met the other members of the Crimson Vow at the Hunters' Prep School and helped to form the party. She is tall and has an androgynous appearance, making her popular with other girls. She is a softie for sappy and sad stories, especially the backstories behind each of her friends. ; : : A 14-year-old mage specializing in healing and water magic, she is the daughter of a merchant and the resident bookkeeper of the Crimson Vow. Despite her miserly manner, she typically has a gentle appearance and demeanor but is known to show fits of ruthlessness when called for. Her family's company is called the Beckett Company, although whether Pauline's surname is the same has not been confirmed. ; : :A mysterious creature which only shows itself to Adele. It watches over the nanomachines that make up people's magic in the other world, the remnants of a vastly advanced, now lost civilization. In the manga, it appears as a tiny, sphere-bodied robot, while in the anime it looks like a young cat. ; : :The daughter of a family managing the inn where Mile and later the whole of Crimson Vow take up residence ; : : The third daughter of a baron and a friend of Adele's. At first highly jealous of the attention Adele received for her abilities, she and her friends softened up on her after learning of her tragic family past and sincere personality. ; : : The daughter of a merchant and a friend of Adele's. ; : : A commoner attending Eckland Academy on scholarship and a friend of Adele's. ; : A young man who Misato met after her death, who claims to have a role similar to \\"God\\". As thanks to Misato for saving a girl he had chosen to be mankind's future savior, he grants her a reincarnation into a fantasy world with average abilities, as requested. However, since he measured the term \\"average\\" using the new world's most powerful creature - an ancient dragon - as a template, Misato's reincarnation has been granted powers far beyond what she actually wanted. ; : : Misato's younger sister. Although she loves her family, she is not a hardcore otaku like the rest of them. ==Media== ===Web novel=== FUNA began serializing the story as a web novel on the user-generated novel publishing website Sh≈çsetsuka ni Nar≈ç on January 14, 2016. , 289 chapters of the web novel have been published. ===Light novels=== The series was acquired for print publication by Taibundo and Earth Star Entertainment, who published the first light novel, with illustrations by Itsuki Akata, in May 2016 under their Earth Star Novel imprint.

Hicks' most recognizable works were his stories that covered school integration in Little Rock, Arkansas and Oxford, Mississippi, and his coverage of the Emmett Till murder trial in Sumner, Mississippi. ==Biography== ===Early years=== Hicks was born in Akron, Ohio, on May 9, 1915. He was educated at the University of Akron, Ohio, and Howard University. ===Military service=== Hicks enlisted as a private in the U.S. Army, and during his service in New Guinea he was awarded three battle stars and promoted to captain. In an interview for the documentary, Eyes on the Prize, Hicks claimed that his time spent in the military, among many other black veterans', heavily influenced his activist role when he returned to the United States. Hicks said of the beginning of his involvement in the Civil Rights Movement, \\"I spent three years overseas in New Guinea and I became an officer during that period. I had been eager to exercise authority, so when we got out it was just one more step towards saying, 'look, we aren't going to take this anymore'.\\" ===Career=== Hicks began his career in journalism as a reporter for the Cleveland Call and Post in 1935. After his stint in the war, he joined the Baltimore Afro-American, and in his time there became the Washington Bureau Chief for the National Negro Press Association. He served as the executive editor for the New York Amsterdam News during 1955‚Äì1966, and again 1972‚Äì1977. In 1977, he became editor for the New York Voice. Hicks also held positions in public relations for the National Urban League and as the assistant commissioner of the New York State Division of Human Rights. Hicks was the first black member of the State Department Correspondents Association and the first black journalist cleared to cover the United Nations; for this he is labeled by some as a \\"pioneer in the field\\". ====Emmett Till murder trial==== Hicks' coverage of the Emmett Till murder trial was published as a series of installments in dozens of newspapers including the Baltimore Afro- American, the Cleveland Call and Post, and the Atlanta Daily World. His investigative journalism uncovered the identities of two key witnesses to the murder, who Hicks believed, would have led to the prosecution of the accused, Roy Bryant and J.W. Milam. The witnesses, Leroy \\"Too-Tight\\" Collins, and Henry Lee Loggins, had been seen riding in the back of J.W. Milam's truck with Emmett Till the night he was murdered. Hicks and his colleague, L. Alex Wilson, continued to track down these witnesses well after the trial had ended and this investigative work was featured in the documentary, \\"The Untold Story of Emmett Louis Till\\" produced by Keith Beauchamp. Articles by Hicks written for the Cleveland Call and Post are found in Christopher Metress's The Lynching of Emmett Till: A Documentary Narrative (University of Virginia Press, Sept 2002). These were published in the 2000 Spring issue of Archipelago Vol. 6, No. 1. On January 20, 2003 the documentary ‚ÄúThe Murder of Emmett Till‚Äù was broadcast by ‚ÄúAmerican Experience‚Äù and PBS. The book Why It‚Äôs Unlikely the Emmett Till Murder Mystery Will Ever Be Solved by authors David T. Beito and Linda Royster Beito include references to Hicks' role in events surrounding the trial of Bryant and Milam. ==== The Little Rock Nine ==== In 1957, Hicks, alongside several other representatives of the black press, Earl Davy, Moses Newson, and L. Alex Wilson, attended the integration of nine black students into Little Rock Central High School. When the black reporters arrived on the scene they were beaten and chased by a mob, which was protesting the integration outside the school. After the students gained entry to the school, the mob accused the black reporters of being a decoy for the students. In a story he wrote for Amsterdam News on September 28, 1957, Hicks states, \\"After we were safely out of the mob area, reports came over the radio that we had been sent to the school as 'decoys' to the mob so that they would not notice the Negro children when they slipped in. This is actually what happened but it certainly was not in our plan.\\" ==== James Meredith and Ole Miss ==== In Hicks' story, \\"On the Mississippi Warfront: Oxford's a Town all Shook Up\\", printed by Amsterdam News in 1962, Hicks described the events leading up to James Meredith's reported visit to the Ole Miss campus as \\"chaos and bedlam\\". Despite the possession of valid press credentials, the black press members, including Hicks, were denied access to the campus and were only able to cover the story from outside the school gates. Because of his inability to access the campus, Hicks followed the mob to stay close to the story of James Meredith's arrival. In order to keep James Meredith, a black student attempting to integrate Ole Miss, out of Oxford, the town \\"massed every law officer the state of Mississippi could produce\\", and hoped this would convince Meredith not to return. Hicks described the town as a \\"mess\\". ==Death== Hicks died in Manhattan, New York, on January 16, 1986 at the age of 70. ==Personal life== He was married to the former Daisy Turner, and they had two children, James Jr. and Norma Hicks Robinson. ==External References== Cleveland Call & Post Oct 1955 James L.

Likely to have been built in the 11th century, the building retains many medieval architectural features, and is Grade I listed. It also retains an elaborately decorated 15th-century pulpit, considered one of the finest surviving examples of its type. ==Architecture== The extensive churchyard of St Margaret's The village of Burnham Norton is one of the Norfolk Burnhams, a group of villages in Norfolk, England. Approximately west of Wells-next-the-Sea,Ordnance Survey (2002) OS Explorer Map 251 ‚Äì Norfolk Coast Central it is separated from the sea by tidal marshes. Burnham Norton's parish church, St Margaret's, is one of 129 surviving round-tower churches in Norfolk. Opinion differs as to its date of construction. Most historians conclude that the tower and at least part of the main building is Anglo-Saxon in origin, built between 1000 and 1066 AD. However, no church is listed in Burnham Norton in 1086's Domesday Book, leading some historians to believe that the building is of early Norman construction. The building was gradually altered in later years, and is not internally symmetrical. The north arcade is supported by 13th-century round columns, while the south arcade is supported by more elaborate 14th-century octagonal columns. The east window of the church is an ornate stained-glass window installed in the late 1920s, depicting saints Margaret of Antioch and Margaret of Scotland. The church building is Grade I listed, the highest level of recognition available to a historical building in England. ==Internal elements== Internally, the church retains many of its medieval architectural elements, including an unusually large stone font. A recess near the north door was once the wafer oven used to bake communion wafers. St Margaret's also retains its rood screen, donated in 1458 by William and Johanne Groom; the screen's panels originally depicted images of saints and the Grooms, but these images were defaced during the Reformation. St Margaret's has two pulpits. One is in regular use, and was built in the 19th century to a plain design, using early 17th-century paneling from the church. The other is no longer in use, and was gifted to the church by John and Catharine Goldale in 1450. The latter is considered one of the finest surviving examples of its style. A \\"wine glass\\" shape, a hexagon tapering at the base to a narrow point, it is heavily decorated; its six panels depict the Goldales, Pope Gregory I, Augustine of Canterbury, Saint Ambrose and Saint Jerome. ==Burials== * David Jamieson VC is buried in the churchyard * Lady Margaret Douglas-Home (great aunt of Diana, Princess of Wales) * Richard Woodget, master of the Cutty Sark ==Notes== ==References== ===Bibliography=== * ==External links== Burnham Norton, St Margaret's Church Burnham Norton Burnham Norton Burnham Norton Burnham Norton ","title":"St Margaret's Church, Burnham Norton"},{"id":"56694879","text":"Walter Edward Tinsley (10 August 1891 ‚Äì 7 March 1966) was an English professional footballer who played as an inside forward for Sunderland. ==References== Category:1891 births Category:1966 deaths Category:People from Ironville Category:English footballers Category:Association football inside forwards Category:Alfreton Town F.C. players Category:Ashfield United F.C. players Category:Sunderland A.F.C. players Category:Middlesbrough F.C. players Category:Nottingham Forest F.C. players Category:Reading F.C. players Category:English Football League players ","title":"Walter Tinsley"},{"id":"56694893","text":"Liselotte Michel (born 4 May 1939) is a Swiss alpine skier.

Religion was a major contributor, since it was an important social practice that bound all Egyptians together. For instance, many of the Egyptian gods played roles in guiding the souls of the dead through the afterlife. With the evolution of writing, religious ideals were recorded and quickly spread throughout the Egyptian community. The solidification and commencement of these doctrines were formed in the creation of afterlife texts which illustrated and explained what the dead would need to know in order to complete the journey safely. Egyptian religious doctrines included three afterlife ideologies; belief in an underworld, eternal life, and rebirth of the soul. The underworld, also known as the Duat, had only one entrance that could be reached by traveling through the tomb of the deceased. The initial image a soul would be presented with upon entering this realm was a corridor lined with an array of fascinating statues, including a variation of the famous hawk-headed god, Horus. The path taken to the underworld may have varied between kings and common people. After entry, spirits were presented to another prominent god, Osiris. Osiris would determine the virtue of the deceased's soul and grant those deemed deserving a peaceful afterlife. The Egyptian concept of 'eternal life' was often seen as being reborn indefinitely. Therefore, the souls who had lived their life elegantly were guided to Osiris to be born again. In order to achieve the ideal afterlife, many practices had to be performed during one's life. This may have included acting justly and following the beliefs of Egyptian creed. Additionally, the Egyptians stressed the rituals completed after an individual's life has ended. In other words, it was the responsibility of the living to carry out the final traditions required so the dead could promptly meet their final fate. Ultimately, maintaining high religious morals by both the living and the dead, as well as complying to a variety of traditions guaranteed the deceased a smoother transition into the underworld. == Funeral practices == There were many challenges the dead had to face before they were able to enter into the final stages of the afterlife. However, through the support of the living, the dead had access to the protection and knowledge they would need to be reborn in the netherworld. === Tombs === The design and scale of Egyptian burial tombs varied from period to period, even though their function remained the same. While most tombs were built during the lifetime of the person it was meant for, Egyptian tombs were constructed to house the body of the dead, but also functioned to transmit the soul to the underworld. Most of the what was found in a tomb depended on the status of the person buried within it. However, in order to assist the dead, most tombs were decorated with afterlife texts meant to help guide the deceased's soul to the afterlife, something that was attainable to all. === Afterlife texts === Throughout the centuries, the Egyptian people decorated their tombs and coffins with religious spells and texts hoping to help the dead in the afterlife. As Egyptian culture developed these texts, too, evolved, becoming more complex and extensive in nature. ==== Pyramid Texts ==== Pyramid Text within the burial pyramid of Teti I The Pyramid Texts were the first religious spells to be carved into the walls of royal ancient Egyptian pyramids. Beginning in the Old Kingdom period, these texts were used exclusively by the Egyptian pharaohs to decorate the walls of their tombs. However, Egyptian Queens and high-ranking government officials soon began to use Pyramid Texts in their burial tombs as well. The purpose of these texts were to help the pharaoh successfully complete his journey through the afterlife, by conveying knowledge to the deceased about the paths he should take and the dangers he might face along the way. ==== Coffin Texts ==== In the Middle Kingdom period the Pyramid Texts were replaced by the Coffin Texts. The Coffin Texts were spells that were inscribed into the coffins of the dead. They were meant to protect the deceased in the afterlife and provide them with the transformation magic they would need along their journey. These Coffin Texts were generally more attainable, providing the common people of Egypt the opportunity to attain a proper afterlife. It is also important to note that the collection of Coffin Texts known as The Book of Two Ways functioned as the earliest manual to the afterlife. ==== Book of the Dead ==== The Book of the Dead was an extensive collection of spells that included material from both the Pyramid Texts and the Coffin Texts. In the New Kingdom period, the Book of the Dead was normally recorded on papyrus. However, it could also be found on the tomb walls, coffins and the wrappings of mummies. Like the Coffin Texts, the spells illustrated within the Book of the Dead were used by everyone. These spells offered advice, protection and knowledge to the dead as they journeyed through the netherworld. ==== Books of the Netherworld ==== The 11th hour of the book Amduat The Books of the Netherworld contained multiple texts that provided the deceased with a description of the underworld and served as a guide to help the dead during their final journey. Since the deceased were often seen replicating the rebirth cycle of Ra as they traveled through the afterlife, these texts primarily focused on the second half of the sun god's journey, which took him through the underworld at night. The earlier Books of the Netherworld, which include the Amduat and the Book of Gates, divided their narratives into twelve parts, symbolizing the twelve hours the sun god spent in the underworld. Later books such as the Book of Caverns and the Book of the Earth used a more sectionalized approach when presenting their narratives. All of these books also contained complex illustrations of the netherworld, which could often be seen etched into coffins and the walls of burial tombs. ==== Books of the Sky ==== The Books of Sky consisted of three afterlife texts titled, the Book of Nut, the Book of Day and the Book of Night. Carved into the ceiling of tombs these texts emphasized the role the goddess Nut played in the Egyptian afterlife. === Coffins === Coffins in Egyptian culture date back to the Old Kingdom. During this era, coffins were relatively simple; they were equilateral makings with minor details. These included three openings, one that the Ka was intended to pass through and two that represented eyes. However, as time passed coffins and their structures evolved. By the New Kingdom, coffins had not only become more popular around the area but were distributed for sale. The deceased's body was now represented by the coffin as it held a shape and was decorated with features that resembled the individual inside it. The deceased were also often depicted in white clothes, because it represented the soul's purity after it had passed through judgement, in the Hall of Maat. Additionally, the orientation of the deceased was very important to ancient Egyptians. In early periods, the body would have laid promptly on their side with their head directed to the south. This later shifted and with the body flat on its back, the north became a more favorable position for the dead's head to lie. === Mummification === Egyptian mummy Mummification was a practice that the ancient Egyptians adopted because they believed that the body needed to be preserved in order for the dead to be reborn in the afterlife. Initially, Egyptians thought that like Ra, their physical bodies, or Khat, would reawaken after they completed their journey through the underworld. Once the Egyptians realized that the bodies of their dead would eventually decay, they started to see the remains of the dead as a vessel for the deceased's spirit. The body was dismembered and wrapped in bandages to safeguard it, if the soul decided to return. === Funeral offerings === To many Egyptians the tomb was seen as a home for the dead, so it was customary to leave offerings near the body of the deceased. Egyptians believed that even after one's death their spirit would live because their life force was a separate entity that could detach itself from the body. This life force was called the Ka, and was considered to be one part of what the Egyptian believed to be the immortal soul. The Ba was another part of the soul that had increased mobility and dwelled within the Ka. Offerings that were left for the dead included clothing and valuable ornaments. However, the most important offering was food, because even though the Ka was separated from the body it could still starve. ==Journey to the afterlife == An example of a model boat Ancient Egyptians theorized the passage to the afterlife in a series of stages. The first phase was believed to encompass the vehicle of transportation, which would eventually direct their departed souls to immortality. Individuals were subjected to a multitude of passages; but the choice of route was not theirs, it was dependent on their status. The aspect that was most universally influential in determining what passage was taken was one's position among their leaders. Despite the differences between voyagers, beliefs concerning the afterlife are astronomically reliant on religious ideologies. For example, early people often used religion to understand and comprehend, as well as relate to natural occurrences since science had not yet defined everyday incidents. To demonstrate, there was no justification for the sun's orbit, so religious myths redefined and answered the questions prehistoric people had. Yet, since natural incidences were explained by religious beliefs, other realms of creed mimicked the natural patterns of life. For instance, the general ideology associated with the path to the underworld was believed that as night overshadowed the land, the deceased would begin their journey. And with the rising of the sun, a new day was not only thought to have begun, but a new life as well. Boat passages to the underworld were strictly reserved for pharaohs who had died. The Egyptian sun god, Ra, was believed to travel to the underworld by boat as the sun set. As a way to mimic Ra's daily expedition, the ancient people of Egypt would construct model boats, ranging in many sizes in which they would bury alongside their Pharaohs. For example, next to the Pyramid of Khufu, researchers uncovered a boat the size of traditional ships, which displayed not only the extreme devotion Egyptians had for their leader, but their dedication to obtaining eternity for all. In other words, a great deal of the requirements for the deceased to properly reach the underworld rested on the living. In order for Pharaohs to arrive at their final destination, his people had to construct a variety of boats to ensure his departure. As a result, communities had to come together to support each other, otherwise their perspective of immortality, as well as their beliefs would end indefinitely. Therefore, commitment to helping others achieve eternity was a vital component to Egyptian culture, as demonstrated by the gallant boats buried with their rulers. Additionally, an alternate vehicle for entrance to the underworld was the coffin. While king's often used coffins in addition to, or in substitution of the boat belief, everyday citizens had less choice. Therefore, this method was more universal while alluding to a different, more ‚Äòfrequent‚Äô path of entry. To compare, while passages by boat directed the deceased to the sun god, Ra, coffins were thought to guide individuals to the sky goddess, Nut. Each coffin was uniquely attributed to the person who rested in it. In other words, every coffin was subject to a variety of interpretations, all of which were intended to promote the deceased in obtaining eternity. However, not all who died were presented with the opportunity to travel to the underworld. Since the living were obligated to ensure that the deceased could travel to the afterlife, it was also in their control to eliminate one's chance in achieving eternity. Therefore, the living had an array of options that prevented a second life to an unworthy individual who had died. The most famous included decapitation, which when executed, ‚Äúkilled a person twice.‚Äù As a result, the second death associated with decapitation was also assumed to have annihilated the chance at another life. As noted in Egyptian texts, this instance was incredibly feared, but happened most often to those who rebelled or disobeyed the king. == Judgement of the dead == Judgment of the Dead To the ancient Egyptians, the judgment of the dead was the process that allowed the Egyptian gods to judge the worthiness of the souls of the deceased. Deeply rooted in the Egyptian belief of immortality, judgment was one of the most important parts of the journey through the afterlife. As such, many variations of judgment scenes appear in the Egyptian afterlife texts. Each soul that entered the afterlife was handled individually during judgment. Once the deceased finished their journey through the underworld, they arrived at the Hall of Maat. Here their purity would be the determining factor in whether they would be allowed to enter the Kingdom of Osiris. The deceased's first task was to correctly address each of the forty-two judges, by name, while reciting the sins they did not commit during their lifetime. This process allowed the dead to demonstrate that they knew each of the judges‚Äô names or Ren and established that they were pure, and free of sin. After confirming that they were sinless, the deceased was presented with the balance that was used to weight their heart against the feather of Maat. Anubis was the god often seen administering this test. If the deceased's heart balanced with the feather of Maat, Thoth would record the result and they would be presented to Osiris, who admitted them into the Sekhet-Aaru. However, if their heart was heavier than the feather, it was to be devoured by the Goddess Ammit, permanently destroying the soul of the deceased. == Rebirth == There were numerous ways for Egyptians to secure their fate. Many of the actions Egyptian people took after death were to influence the god's decision in allowing for another life. After judgement, entities were thought to return to the Mother Goddess' womb. During this stage, the soul meets its former body that is restored. To demonstrate, in the Book of Dead there is a series of lines that read as follows, \\"I unite your limbs, I hold your discharges together, I surround your flesh, I drive away the fluids of your decay, I sweep away your bow, I wipe away your tears, I heal all your limbs, each being united with the other; I surround you with the work of the weaving goddess, I complete you and form you as Re.\\" The belief continues as the nude being approaches the Goddess and enters her womb as her son. To compare, this dogma is deeply related to the birth of the sun god Ra, who enters the goddess's womb every night, and is reborn as the sun rises. Ra's relation to the afterlife is very connected through the religious components that justify the rising and setting of the sun. Ultimately, the immortality desired by ancient Egyptians was reflected in endless lives. By doing worthy deeds in their current life, they would be granted a second life for all of eternity. == Gender == According to Egyptoligist Katherine M Cooney https://www.academia.edu/998725/Gender_Transformation_in_Death_A_Case_Study_of_Coffins_from_Ramesside_Period_Egypt , ancient Egyptian women were forced to redefine their gender by encompassing more masculine features. Osiris, who was the ultimate ruler of the underworld, was applauded for his incredible superiority as a result of his virility. Additionally, the overall theme associated with gods connected their male attributes to resurrection, and goddesses were much more vigilant. This ideology was conspired from original doctrines, which denoted the overall creator a male. Statues and other forms of display made significant notice of their creator's masculine qualities, more specifically pointing out his erect penis. Therefore, to appease their god's preferences women's tombs and coffins displayed male qualities. Examples of male modifications included name combinations, in which women engraved ‚ÄúOsiris‚Äù before their own name on their coffins. This demonstrated the collaboration of women and a god who was capable of rebirth, because alone her sex restricted her. These displays of gender transformation are just one of many ways that people of today are able to identify the idea of rebirth after death in Egyptian practices.https://www.academia.edu/998725/Gender_Transformation_in_Death_A_Case_Study_of_Coffins_from_Ramesside_Period_Egypt == Sekhet-Aaru == Sekhet-Aaru, or commonly recognized as the \\"Field of Reeds\\", was the final destination for all souls who had been granted rebirth. This ideology evolved in the Fifth Dynasty. Sekhet-Aaru was essentially thought to be paradise and encompassed this visualization. To further elaborate, the Field of Reeds were visualized as a very lush region, filled with waterfalls among other natural wonders. Egyptian images, such as Papyrus of Nebseni, depicted the land to be divided into numerous sections. Each division was imagined to resemble island structures, in which travel by boat is necessary. Those who were granted access to the Field of Reeds included both gods and righteous souls. The fertility of the land was greatly emphasized as this possessed two of the major rewards in obtaining immortality: access to the Nile, and the ability to farm foods. As a result, the deceased ate and drank the same delicacies devoured by their gods. In turn, this promoted the belief that by obtaining immortality, individuals also accumulated aspects that resembled gods. Additionally, a third notable honor of residing in Sekhet-Aaru was the means of communication. The deceased were able to convey thoughts to one another, the gods, and those they had previously lost. ==References== Category:Afterlife Category:Ancient Egyptian religion ","title":"Ancient Egyptian afterlife beliefs"},{"id":"56695082","text":"Antipathella fiordensis is a species of colonial coral in the order Antipatharia, the black corals, so named because their calcareous skeletons are black. It was first described as Antipathes fiordensis by the New Zealand zoologist Ken R. Grange in 1990, from material collected in the steep-sided fiords of Fiordland in the southeastern South Island, New Zealand. A 2001 revision of the Antipatheria put this species in the newly-created genus Antipathella. ==Description== Antipathella fiordensis with a basket star on one branch Black corals have flexible bushy or tree-like forms. They have black skeletons of dense, horny material, covered by a thin layer of living tissue from which the polyps project. Each polyp has six unbranched tentacles and a slit-shaped mouth, and is non-retractable. Normal tentacles are less than long, but this black coral can develop sweeper tentacles up to long, armed with stinging cells, in apparent response to epiphytic organisms attempting to grow on the branches. These corals do not contain zooxanthellae in their tissues and thus do not need to live in sunlit places. A. fiordensis has a 50:50 sex ratio, with no obvious differences between the sexes. Colonies do not reach sexual maturity until they are about 0.7‚Äì1.0 m tall, aged at least 30 years. Female colonies produce between 1.3 million and nearly 17 million oocytes each year. ==Distribution == Antipathella fiordensis occurs in the seas around New Zealand at depths of from . ==Ecology== The fiords where A. fiordensis grows have nearly vertical rock walls, providing limited sites for attachment of organisms, so many other species live on these corals. One is the basket star Astrobrachion constrictum, which perches and coils its arms tightly around the coral's branches. This basket star is found in a number of places around New Zealand, but always in association with a black coral. It seems to be a mutualistic arrangement: coral polyps are more efficient at catching prey than the unbranched arms of a basket star; the basket star appropriates some of the prey, while also cleaning mucus off the coral and preventing epizoic organisms from settling on it. ==References== == External links == * Antipathella fiordensis discussed on RNZ Critter of the Week, 7 September 2018 Category:Antipatharia Category:Animals described in 1990 Category:Cnidarians of the Pacific Ocean Category:Endemic fauna of New Zealand ","title":"Antipathella fiordensis"},{"id":"56695104","text":"Renie Cox (born September 15, 1938) is a retired American alpine ski racer and a former member of the United States Ski Team.

Originally, it was developed for the teaching of French, but there are now a variety of programs based on this approach for the teaching of several different languages. The most widely used program in Canada is that known as \\"Intensive French\\" (IF). ==Context== The NLA was developed in Canada by Claude Germain, of the D√©partement de didactique des langues at the Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Montr√©al, and Joan Netten, of the Faculty of Education at Memorial University of Newfoundland, in the context of the growing influence of emerging educational neurosciences. It draws principally from the research carried out by Michel Paradis (1994,Paradis, M. ‚ÄúNeurolinguistic aspects of implicit and explicit memory: implications for bilingualism‚Äù, in N. Ellis (ed.), Implicit and Explicit Learning of Second Languages. London, Academic Press, 1994, p. 393-419. 2004,Paradis, M. A Neurolinguistic Theory of Bilingualism, Amsterdam/Philadelphia, John Benjamins, 2004. 2009Paradis, M. Declarative and Procedural Determinants of Second Languages, Amsterdam/Philadelphia, John Benjamins, 2009.) of McGill University and by the Institut des sciences cognitives, Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Montr√©al (UQAM), as well as by research conducted by Nick C. Ellis (Centre for Complex systems, University of Michigan). It is also influenced by Vygotsky‚Äôs concepts of social interaction (1997Vygotsky, L.S. Pens√©e et langage, √âditions La Dispute, 1997.). The NLA is characterised by the need to ensure the independent development, in a classroom setting, of both components of any effective communication: an implicit competence, or the ability to spontaneously use a L2/FL orally, and explicit knowledge, or the awareness of the way a language functions, its grammatical rules and its vocabulary. This dimension of the NLA is based on Paradis (1994, 2004) and Nick C. Ellis (2011Ellis, N. ‚ÄúLanguage acquisition just Zipf‚Äôs right along.‚Äù Paper given at the Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Montr√©al, January 2011.). Paradis‚Äôs research makes a clear distinction between explicit knowledge, which is the conscious knowledge surrounding a L2/FL and which is learnt through noticing and explanations, and implicit competence, which can only be acquired non-consciously by using the language in authentic communicative situations. In NLA, implicit competence is referred to as internal grammar. This internal grammar is formed of a network of neuronal connections formed in the brain by the frequent use of the same pathways or circuits; these are NOT rules, but a linguistic structure‚Äôs frequent statistical patterns (Paradis, 2004; Ellis, 2011). Furthermore, explicit knowledge is referred to in the NLA as external grammar. Paradis‚Äôs research shows that explicit knowledge (external grammar) is sustained by the declarative memory, while implicit competence (internal grammar), which is a skill, is sustained by the procedural memory (Germain et Netten, 2013aGermain, C. et Netten, J. ‚ÄúPour une nouvelle approche de l‚Äôenseignement de la grammaire en classe de langue : grammaire et approche neurolinguistique‚Äù, Revue japonaise de didactique du fran√ßais, vol. 8, no 1, 2013a, p. 172-187.). According to Paradis, there is no direct connection between these two components. While external grammar is taught relatively effectively in the classroom, the same cannot be said of internal grammar. This is why conventional L2/FL teaching programs, generally based on current methods or approaches, cannot lead most students to acquire spontaneous communication in the language being taught. This is true even of programs which claim to use a communicative approach but which, despite its creators‚Äô theoretical bases, first teach explicit knowledge (grammar rules or knowledge generally founded on written language) before the acquisition of implicit competence, which belongs to oral language (Germain et Netten, 2005,Germain, C. and Netten, J. ‚ÄúPlace et r√¥le de l‚Äôoral dans l‚Äôenseignement / apprentissage d‚Äôune L2,‚Äù, Babylonia, no 2, 2005, p. 7-10. archive 2013b,Germain, C. and Netten, J. ‚ÄúGrammaire de l‚Äôoral et grammaire de l‚Äô√©crit dans l‚Äôapproche neurolinguistique (ANL)‚Äù, Synergies Mexique, no 3, 2013b, p. 15-29. archive Germain, 2017Germain, C. L‚Äôapproche neurolinguistique (ANL) ‚Äì Foire aux questions. Longueuil, Myosotis Presse, 2017.). Paradis‚Äôs views have been challenged in some quarters; however, the co-conceptors of the NLA find them to be the most accurate/satisfactory descriptors of the SL acquisition/learning process. ==Fundamental principles== The NLA is based on five fundamental principles developed by Germain and Netten (2011,Germain, C. and Netten, J. ‚ÄúImpact de la conception de l‚Äôacquisition d‚Äôune langue seconde ou √©trang√®re sur la conception de la langue et de son enseignement‚Äù, Synergies Chine, no 6, 2011, p. 25-36. archive 2012a;Germain, C. and Netten, J. ‚ÄúUne p√©dagogie de la litt√©ratie sp√©cifique √† la L2‚Äù, R√©flexions, vol. 31, no 1, 2012a, p. 17-18. archive Netten and Germain, 2012Netten, J. and Germain, C. Approche neurolinguistique ‚Äì Guide p√©dagogique ‚Äì Fran√ßais intensif, 2e √©dition, remani√©e, 2011.) to create the necessary classroom conditions for students to first learn spontaneous oral communication in their L2/FL, before moving on to explicit knowledge of the language in reading and writing activities (Germain et Netten 2013b; Germain, 2017). ===Acquisition of internal grammar (implicit competence)=== In order to create a classroom atmosphere where a limited number of linguistic structures are used and reused often enough to ensure that patterns, or neuronal connections, are developed in the students‚Äô procedural memory, each teaching unit introduces three or four communicative functions which are related both to each other and to the unit‚Äôs theme. Each function is presented and used individually in several different situations allowing for brief personal conversations between the students. At the end of the unit, the functions are combined to permit more complex discussions on the subject. Thus, oral language is learnt in a conversational context. The importance of the context in permitting an effective transfer to other situations has been confirmed in Segalowitz‚Äôs recent work in cognitive neuroscience, in particular his concept of Transfer Appropriate Processing (TAP) (Segalowitz, 2010Segalowitz, N. Cognitive bases of second language fluency, New York, Oxon, UK, Routledge & Abingdon, 2010.). ===Recourse to a literacy-based perspective in teaching a L2/FL=== Literacy is usually understood as the ability to use a language to interpret and understand the environment. A literacy-based perspective allows the teacher to consider the acquisition of a language as the development of skills rather than of knowledge. This also means prioritising the development of oral skills, a view confirmed by recent research in neurodidactic science (Huc and Smith, 2008Huc, P. and Vincent Smith, B. ‚ÄúNaissance de la neurodidactique‚Äù, Le Fran√ßais dans le Monde, 357, 2008, p. 30-31.) which calls for the development of verbal communication before reading and writing. Texts used during the reading portion of the class, as well as the topics for written work, are based on the same theme and involve using the same structures first developed verbally. Reading and writing are taught directly in the L2/FL without recourse to translation. The strategies used are similar to those used for developing literacy when teaching the students their first language, but must be modified. For instance, a greater emphasis may be placed on oral preparation before reading and writing, which is essential when developing literacy in a L2/FL, given that the students‚Äô internal grammar is considerably more limited than that of those who are learning to read and write in their first language (Germain et Netten, 2005, 2012,Germain, C. and Netten, J. ‚ÄúUne p√©dagogie de la litt√©ratie sp√©cifique √† la L2‚Äù, R√©flexions, vol. 31, no 1, 2012, p. 17-18. archive 2013b, Germain, 2017). A literacy-based approach also allows for external grammar to be brought into play after the language has been used orally and in context (observing grammatical details in the reading text and using these observed cases when writing paragraphs). ===Recourse to a project- based approach=== In order for students to acquire an internal grammar, the focus must be on the message rather than on the language, as internal grammar can only be acquired unconsciously that is, without consciously paying attention to the language‚Äôs features (Paradis, 1994, 2004, 2009). To facilitate the creation of significant situations and interesting, cognitively challenging tasks for the students, the content of the teaching units is organised sequentially, going from a few mini projects to a final project. The suggested activities are therefore not isolated and require the students‚Äô active participation, which calls on other cerebral mechanisms that are essential to successfully acquiring a language (Paradis, 2004). This type of organisation also allows each unit‚Äôs language structures to be used and reused, while allowing the teacher to help students to learn by gradually increasing the difficulty of both tasks and language structures. ===Use of authentic communicative situations=== The ability to communicate spontaneously develops only through authentic communication. It cannot be learnt through controlled exercises or by memorising dialogues (R. Ellis, 1997Ellis. R. SLA research and language teaching. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997.) where the language thus learned is focused, foremost, on linguistic forms and is stored in the declarative memory. This type of activity does not permit the student to use the same structures sufficiently often to develop the patterns required to create implicit competence, or internal grammar, unconsciously. Moreover, only authentic communication calls on other cerebral mechanisms that are necessary for acquisition to happen, such as those linked to motivation (Paradis, 2004). In the NLA, all classroom communication is authentic: the teacher does not ask unrealistic questions and the students‚Äô answers are always personal. Communication always takes place in the L2/FL. ===Use of interactive teaching strategies=== Interaction between students in the L2/FL is an essential ingredient for developing internal grammar and the ability to communicate spontaneously. To facilitate such interactions, the NLA applies five steps to teaching oral communication, throughout the teaching units, as well as encouraging activities carried out in pairs or in small-groups. On the linguistic level, the way is prepared for students to use the structures they require to accomplish the assigned tasks, but the interactions are authentic in that the students express their own thoughts. There are also three other specific teaching strategies recommended in using the NLA: fluency, accuracy, and purposeful listening. The students must reply in complete sentences when learning new language structures, in order to facilitate the building of their internal grammar and the ease with which they use the L2/FL. For internal grammar, accuracy is achieved by consistent and instant oral correction of errors and having the student reuse the correct structure orally. Essentially, in developing internal grammar, oral correction of errors replaces the teaching of grammar rules. Purposeful listening, meanwhile, replaces the usual oral comprehension exercises; it is a matter of encouraging learners to constantly listen to what the teacher and the other learners say\\" (Germain, 2017, p. 89). The NLA uses eight strategies for learning/teaching both reading and writing. Currently (2018), there are several implementations of the NLA, notably the Intensive French (IF) program in Canada and a French language training program at a Chinese university. The Canadian IF, which is geared to 5th and 6th grade students (11/12 years old) and continues to the end of high school, was launched in the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador in 1998. Since then, it has spread to almost all Canadian provinces and territories (the French-majority province of Qu√©bec has an intensive English program which, as it is not based on NLA principles, is similar but not identical to IF). Over 70,000 students have participated in the first year of the IF program in Canada since its inception. In China, the program is aimed at young adults (median age of 19) and was launched at the South China Normal University (Guangzhou) in 2010. It has attracted much interest from other Chinese institutions (including a high school) as well as in Japan (Gal Bailly, 2011;Gal Bailly, T. Mise en place d‚Äôune m√©thode contemporaine d‚Äôenseignement du fran√ßais langue √©trang√®re en milieu universitaire chinois. √âvaluation comparative entre la m√©thode traditionnelle chinoise et l‚Äôapproche neurolinguistique dans un cadre pr√© exp√©rimental, Master 2 Sciences Humaines et Sciences Sociales, Universit√© de Rouen, 2011, 147 p.

These programs were developed under the direction of the NLA‚Äôs co-developers. At this time, other implementations of the NLA are being developed in Canada by other professionals in order to teach certain First Nations languages in Yukon and the Northwest Territories, as well as in Saskatchewan, Prince Edward Island, the James Bay region of Qu√©bec for the teaching of English, French and Cree, and the teaching of Mohawk, French and English to the Mohawk Nation which extends through the southern part of Ontario and Quebec and northern New York state. Programs in Spanish and Mandarin are also implemented in the Calgary Public School Board. Any curricular resource that conforms to NLA principles can be adapted to teach communication skills in any L2/FL, as suggested by a recent trial of teaching/learning Spanish among francophone Quebeckers in a university setting (specifically, at UQ√ÄM, the Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Montr√©al). ==Notes== ==References== * N.

A motherly figure created as an embodiment of excessive video game tutorials, she is a member of the monster race with hanging ears, with small horns, white-furred and wearing a purple robe. Literally \\"hand-holding\\" the player through the opening sections of the game, the player must attempt to escape the area, upon which point they fight her. The player can choose to kill her or convince her to stop fighting, having implications on the game at large. The character has received attention from critics and fans for her personality as well as the atypical moral choice of her boss battle. A version of the character also appears in Deltarune. == Characteristics == ===Undertale=== The player meets Toriel shortly after they fall into the Underground, where she is seen as a motherly figure who desires to protect the player from its dangers. She teaches the player the mechanics of the game, encouraging them to show mercy to enemies rather than attack them. Giving the player a phone with which to contact her, she leaves the player on their own to figure out the rest of the Ruins, after which they arrive at her house. While she attempts to take care of the player, they become restless and attempt to leave the Ruins. Having seen several human children die at the hands of the monster king Asgore, she fears for the player's safety and confronts them in battle. If the player chooses not to kill her, the battle is \\"long and arduous\\" with little indication that the player's tactics are working until she relents. In fact, she must be spared many times in order to persuade her to allow the player to leave the Ruins. If Toriel is killed after she relents, however, she tells the player that she realized she regrets trying to have raised the player. It is later revealed that Toriel was once Asgore's wife, Toriel Dreemurr, and they had a son, Asriel Dreemurr. When Asriel died, she gave up her crown due to her disagreement with Asgore, over his willingness to kill human children to break the seal holding the monsters underground. Near the end of the Pacifist route, Toriel arrives at \\"New Home\\" (The Monsters' Capital) and saves the human from Asgore. However, Flowey appears and absorbs her soul along with all the other monsters in the Underground to regain his true form, Asriel. Later, after the player has fought Asriel, and he has broken the barrier, Toriel and the other monsters leave the Underground. Toriel offers to provide a home for the human; the player can choose to accept or reject this. In the non-playable pacifist epilogue we see that Toriel has achieved her dream of founding and teaching a school. ===Deltarune=== In Deltarune, Toriel is the adoptive mother of Kris and biological mother of Asriel. She wakes up Kris at the beginning of the game and drops them off at school. After returning from the Dark World, Kris receives a call from Toriel, who tells them that they are in trouble for being late. However, she seems pleased to hear that Kris has made a friend, and allows Kris to explore the town before coming home. She later appears when Kris returns home. It is hinted in the game that Toriel works as a teacher for a younger class at Kris' school. == Development == Toriel was initially envisioned by the game's creator, Toby Fox, as a \\"tutorial person that can't stand to see you leave\\". She was later incorporated as the final boss of the game's demo, which was used to promote its successful Kickstarter campaign. == Merchandise == An official Toriel plush was released by Fangamer. The plush contains a white heart soul inside, which can only be found if the plush is cut apart. This detail reflects her death scene in Undertale, and was described by Kotaku as \\"weirdly unsettling\\". A figure of Toriel was also released by Fangamer as part of a set. == Reception == Jess Joho of Kill Screen called the character \\"relying on the inhumanly selfless portrait of motherhood\\", but doing so with a purpose, praising the boss encounter with her as respecting the player's ability to think through a problem, as well as their basic instincts as a human being. She stated that the game holds up a mirror to \\"patriarchal\\" game design that encourages players to impatiently \\"sacrifice their own mother and humanity\\" rather than engaging with the enemy on a \\"human level\\". Nathan Grayson of Kotaku stated that while he killed Toriel during his playthrough, his encounter with her made him cry due to her friendliness and relatability as a character. He also praised the game for remembering this on his next playthrough. Jack de Quidt of Rock, Paper, Shotgun called the tutorial sequence featuring her \\"beautifully paced\\" and praised the character, saying \\"Toriel's all right\\", while Richard Cobbett of the same site called her sprite animations \\"understated but effective\\". Julie Muncy of Kill Screen criticized the encounter with Toriel as unintuitive, saying that she lost the ability to trust the game after being seemingly forced to kill Toriel, which forced her onto the game's \\"Neutral\\" route. == References == Category:Anthropomorphic characters in video games Category:Fiction about goats Category:Female characters in video games Category:Queen characters in video games Category:Video game bosses Category:Video game characters introduced in 2015 Category:Video game characters with fire or heat abilities Category:Video game characters who use magic Category:Undertale ","title":"Toriel"},{"id":"56695275","text":"John Stanley Schuchman (November 12, 1938 ‚Äì December 19, 2017) was an American educator and academic administrator who taught at Gallaudet University.

Bray's origins aren't concretely known and are supplanted (and probably distorted) by familial tradition, however his reputation was already prolific in the Massachusetts Bay Colony decades before his death. His progeny, the Wilkins family, had a strong presence in the area. Bray and his seed were prominent figures in some Salem Witch Trials. ==Early life== Very little is known about Bray's life before emigrating to the Massachusetts Bay Colony. It is known from his own admission and other records which required such information that Bray was born about 1610, in Wales. Where in Wales he was born is up for debate, it is sometimes suggested he was born in Brecknockshire, however, this is based on the mistaken assumption that Bray was a descendant of the lord John Wilkins, who married the sister of Oliver Cromwell, the fact that John Wilkins was born more than four years after Bray often overlooked. The authors of several historical works on old Salem and New England make significantly similar claims that Bray was a descendant, in varying forms, of the lordly Wilkins families in Wales. William C. Hill states it is \\"quite likely\\" that Bray heralded from one of these Wilkins families, whose presence in Wales is well attested.Hill, William Carroll, b. 1875. The Family of Bray Wilkins: \\"Patriarch of Will's Hill\\", of Salem (Middleton), Mass. Milford, N.H.: Cabinet Press, 1943. Thus, though the immediate descendancy is a mystery, Bray was probably a descendant of Robert de Wintona, one of the men who captured Wales for the Norman people alongside Robert FitzHamon in the mid-11th century. Robert became the lord over Llandow and Llanblethian, in the latter of which he built a large manor which housed his descendants for some years. His great-grandson, Wilkyne de Winton, is the first attestation of what would become the surname 'Wilkins'. Over time, the by-names of Robert's descendants became corrupted, eventually forming surnames such as Wilcolyne, Wilkyn, Wilkin, and ultimately, Wilkins. That being said, Bray's immediate origins are still nonetheless a mystery. \\"Thorough inquiry\\" conducted by English and Welsh genealogical authorities have found no definite trace of Bray or his immediate ancestors. Family tradition places his birth in Glamorganshire on 16 October 1610, as the son of Thomas John Willkins and Hannah Nichols. However, as stated, there are no (surviving) records supporting these conclusions. As for this rumor's origins ‚Äî one of Bray's grandsons, Bray II, was born by Bray's son Thomas and his wife Hannah Nichols, and it's likely a confusion arose between the two due to the shared name and this paternity was applied to the former Bray in genealogical resources. ==Immigration and life in Massachusetts== Regardless of his origins, Bray arrived in the Thirteen Colonies around 1630, his first residence being recorded as Lynn, Massachusetts. He is first mentioned in a parchment dated January 16, 1632 which describes the allotment of 16 acres of Dorchester to him. He is registered as have taken the Oath of a Freeman on May 14, 1634. Bray was known by the community as a model citizen: upright, pious, and adored. In 1659, Bray and his partner John Gengell (of uncertain relations, see below) leased 700 acres of land eight to ten miles northwest of Salem, which became the town of Danvers, and later Middleton. A controversial mortgage claim lead to Bray and Gengell being brought to court in 1666. ===Salem Witch Trials=== In 1689, Bray and his family, along with several others, moved from Salem proper to establish a church in Danvers. Around 1690, Bray's granddaughter by his son Thomas, Margaret, married a man by the name of John Willard. Willard acted as a constable for the court, and given Bray's legal misfortunes decades prior, the family disapproved of him immediately after it was announced Margaret and John were eloped. The two lived a rather normal life for several years, all the while the Wilkins family did not shy away from making it known how they disapproved of John. During the first weeks of the Salem Witch Trials in spring 1692, paranoia and mania swept through Danvers. Willard, being a constable, at times found himself ordered to arrest townspeople he held in high regard. His refusal to arrest accused witches lead to himself being accused of witchcraft, and on May 10 of the same year a warrant for Willard's arrest was ratified. Willard fled to Nashaway, where he was discovered following the issue of a second warrant for his arrest. Once returned to Danvers, Mercy Lewis, at this time the lover of Henry Wilkins, one of Bray's sons, accused Willard of being responsible for the death of her newborn son Daniel. Willard was put on trial on May 18, during which Bray Wilkins testified that he had been inflicted with a very painful condition after Willard had given him a stare, recounting, \\"[Willard] lookt after such a sort upon me as I never before discerned in any.\\" Indeed, a kidney stone had begun to afflict Bray after he had encountered Willard in the middle of a meal some days before. Thomas was mortified at the proceedings against his son-in- law, and refused to take part in the trial. Two of Bray's daughters and several others gave second-hand testimony that John Willard had beaten his wife Margaret and then exhibited odd behavior which frightened her into running to a relative's house for safety. During his examination, he denied these allegations with the rest, and desired that his wife would be called to testify on his behalf, but this does not appear to have been done. Indeed, no such frenzy is known to have occurred at any point, Margaret and John shared three children and lived a modest life. Regardless, the testimony of the Wilkins family was damning, and Willard was found guilty and hanged for witchcraft that August. ==Death== Bray Wilkins died in January 1702. His burial place is not known, though legend places in on the original foundations of Danvers/Middleton that he and Gengell built, today known as \\"Will's Hill\\", also where he died. ==Marriage and descendants== The identity of Bray Wilkins' wife isn't known, but there are two candidates: Hannah Way and Hannah Gengell. Hannah Gengell is proposed to have been the sister of Bray's lifelong partner John Gengell. Neither candidate has more evidence favoring their identification over the other, however it is more likely Bray married Hannah Way as opposed to Hannah Gengell. Any mention of Bray's wife simply refers to her as \\"Hannah\\" or \\"Anna\\" and no mention of her maiden name is ever recorded in the sparse times she is ever mentioned. No record of her death is known to exist. Bray was only married once, the wedding probably taking place between 1632 and 1636. Per William C. Hill, Bray Wilkins had eight children: # Samuel Wilkins Sr. (December 1636 ‚Äì 20 December 1688) # John Wilkins (22 March 1642 ‚Äì 1723) # Lydia Wilkins (25 September 1644 ‚Äì 1701), who married John Nichols of Topsfield # Thomas Wilkins (16 Mar 1647 ‚Äì October 1717) # Margaret Wilkins ( 1648 ‚Äì 1697), who married Philip Knight Jr. # Henry Wilkins (17 July 1651 ‚Äì 8 December 1737) # Benjamin Wilkins ( 1652 ‚Äì 1715) # James Wilkins ( 1655 ‚Äì ?) It is unlikely James was actually a son of Bray, though he is indeed listed as such in the works of William C. Hill. Bray mentioned neither James nor his heirs in his will, nor did he give James land as he did his known sons, and no one named \\"James\\" was at any time associated with any of Bray's family. John Gengell left legacies to all Bray's children in his will, but James is not mentioned here either. ===Bray's wife: Hannah Gengell or Hannah Way?=== William C. Hill's The Family of Bray Wilkins, Patriarch of Will's Hill, states \\"Bray Wilkins' wife was probably Hannah Gengell. There is no record of the marriage to be found, which probably occurred at Dorchester between 1632 and 1636, for on the latter date Hannah Wilkins, the wife of Bray, is recorded as having been received into the First Church in Dorchester... Hannah Gengell was the sister of John Gengell, one of the incorporators of Taunton, Massachusetts, in 1643.\\" Two persons who had access to much early documentary material about the Wilkins family, now lost, Martha J. Averill and Emily Ann Milliken n√©e Wilkins, maintained that Bray's wife was Hannah Gengell, and furthermore the Wilkins are described with familial kindness in John Gengell‚Äôs will dated 10 April 1685. However, a 1984 article from The American Genealogist written by David L. Greene disputes the identification of Bray's wife as a Gengell by pointing out apparent errors in Hill's work. Greene claimed Hill's main piece of support, John Gengell's will, makes the conclusion impossible, as Gengell called himself 70 in that document, and thus about 21 when Bray married Hannah (though why this fact makes it impossible for the wife of Bray Wilkins to be Hannah Gengell is suspiciously unexplained). Though Greene acknowledges that it is difficult to escape the inference that Bray and John Gengell were in some way related, he advances the following arguments: Henry Way arrived at Nantasket in 1630 (meaning he was in New England when Bray was) with his wife Elizabeth and children Samuel, Richard, Henry, and Susanna. However, Henry Way had at least one more child who emigrated to America with him, Aaron. Greene suggests this seemingly missing entry for his son Aaron Way could mean that another of Henry Way's children may very well have gone undocumented just as Aaron did. Additionally, Bray purportedly sold land to what he called his \\"trusty kinsman\\" in May 1675, one of whom was clarified as Aaron Way. Furthermore, during his testimony against Willard in 1692, Bray called Richard Way, his theoretical brother-in- law, his 'brother'. Greene also mentions one of Bray‚Äôs sons was named ‚ÄòHenry‚Äô, which he postulates was intended as the namesake of Hannah Way‚Äôs father. However, there is no reason to think that other relationships couldn‚Äôt explain the language. After all, members of a common social group might call themselves \\"brothers\\" or \\"cousins\\" without any actual blood or marital relationship. Still, it doesn‚Äôt help the case of the Gengell identification that Hannah Way is attested to while Hannah Gengell isn‚Äôt. John Gengell himself is only sparsely attested to, let alone a hypothetical sister of his, and even then, none of the surviving pieces that attest to his existence give an idea of his personal life. On the other hand, the Way family is very well documented; manuscript summaries of the parish registers for Bridport and Allington, Dorset, in the collection of the Rev. Richard Grosvenor Bartelot, show that Henry Way married Elizabeth Batchelar on 22 Jan. 1615, (apparently as his second wife) and that they had a daughter \\"Hanah\\" who was baptized there on 3 March 1616. Additionally, while it is true and evident in John Gengell‚Äôs will that he regarded the Wilkins very highly, he very explicitly avoids calling them relatives. Coincidentally, Aaron Way is also mentioned alongside a ‚ÄúMary Way‚Äù as a witness in the will. The American Genealogist, Vol. 60; Jan. 1984; Bray Wilkins of Salem Village, Ma. and his children. Greene, David L. pp. 14‚Äì18, 111-113 Clarence Almon Torrey, in his 6,000 page index to what is estimated to be 99% of marriages performed in 17th century New England, asserts that Bray's wife was Hannah Way. ==References== Category:1610 births Category:1702 deaths Category:Accusers in witch trials Category:American city founders Category:People from Salem, Massachusetts Category:People of colonial Massachusetts Category:People of the Salem witch trials Category:Welsh emigrants to the United States ","title":"Bray Wilkins"},{"id":"56695340","text":"Lu√≠s Berkemeier Pimenta (born 25 September 1981) is a Portuguese football manager. ==Personal life== Pimenta was born in Lisbon, Portugal to a Portuguese father and a German mother.

In October 2011, Pimenta was invited to manage the youth academy of the Norwegian club of H√∏nefoss, being also an assistant for the first team, where they reached the best classification in the club's history in 2012, under the lead of Leif Gunnar Smerud. He became the assistant manager of Roar Johansen in 2014, but they were both released that year. In September 2014, he became the manager of Kongsvinger replacing Andr√© Bergd√∏lmo, where Pimenta got his first experience as head coach. He helped the team getting up from the 3. divisjon to the 2. Divisjon 20 points ahead of their closest rivals. The next year, Konsginver finished in fifth and qualified for the promotion playoffs and, more surprisingly, made the 2016 Norwegian Football Cup final, losing to Rosenborg BK. At the end of the season, he declined renewal offers and left the club. After a year off, Pimenta became the head coach of the Swedish club IF Brommapojkarna in the 2018 Allsvenskan, after two seasons of successive promotions by Olof Mellberg. Again, he brought Gon√ßalo Pereira along as his deputy. In August 2018, some players came forward, although under anonymity, to reveal an alleged leadership influenced by racism, penalism and sexism. Despite an internal investigation concluding that the accusations were false, as stated since the beginning by Pimenta, him and his two assistants reached an agreement with the club for the termination of the contract. Two days after Pimenta‚Äôs departure, Brommapojkarna's sport‚Äôs director, Daniel Majstorovic, resigned, disagreeing with the way the club handled this situation, and emphasizing that the accusations were false. Pimenta signed with the Latvian club Riga in February 2019, but left a month later on 2 March. In the summer of 2020 he was appointed as coach of Norway U18 and U19. ==References== ==External links== *Soccerway Profile Category:Living people Category:1981 births Category:Portuguese football managers Category:Portuguese people of German descent Category:Portuguese emigrants to Luxembourg Category:Kongsvinger IL Toppfotball managers Category:IF Brommapojkarna managers Category:Riga FC managers Category:Portuguese expatriate sportspeople in Norway Category:Portuguese expatriate sportspeople in Sweden Category:Portuguese expatriate sportspeople in Latvia Category:Expatriate football managers in Norway Category:Expatriate football managers in Sweden Category:Expatriate football managers in Latvia ","title":"Lu√≠s Pimenta (football manager)"},{"id":"56695361","text":"Ilias Kantzouris (Greek: ŒóŒªŒØŒ±œÇ ŒöŒ±ŒΩœÑŒ∂ŒøœçœÅŒ∑œÇ; born August 11, 1973) is a Greek professional basketball coach. ==Coaching career== ===Professional clubs=== Kantzouris began his coaching career in 2000, as an assistant coach, with the Greek club Apollon Patras.

Jackson served as New Orleans city councilman, from 1986 to 1994. Johnny Jackson Jr. was born September 19, 1943 at Charity Hospital in New Orleans, LA. He was the oldest son of Josephine Brown Jackson and Johnny Jackson, Sr., siblings Bruce, Brandon, Cynthia, Cheryl and Kevin. He graduated from George W. Carver Senior High in 1961. He earned his bachelor's degree from Southern University at New Orleans in 1965 and his master's degree in Social Work from Tulane University in 1980. In 1968, he became director of the Desire Community Center. He was the center's leader during the 1970 standoff between New Orleans police and members of the Black Panther Party, who used the center to offer breakfast, mentoring, and tutoring programs for area youth. From there, leaders of the political organization SOUL recruited him to run for the Louisiana State Legislature. When elected to represent District 101 in 1971, he was the Legislature's third African-American member. Soon after his election, Johnny became the New Orleans delegation's floor leader and he was a founding member of the state's Legislative Black Caucus. He served on the Louisiana State Legislature for 14 years. In 1986, Johnny Jackson was elected to the New Orleans City Council where he served for 8 years (two terms) due to term limitations. On the city council, Johnny headed the housing committee. He also drafted legislation aimed at ensuring equal treatment of the city's gay and lesbian communities. Johnny was a board member of Total Community Action Inc., New Orleans East Economic Development Foundation, Desire-Florida Area Community Council, Development Association of Wards and Neighborhoods, New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Foundation, WWOZ, and the Zulu Social Aid and Pleasure Club.

It was originally intended to be included in her 1995 short story collection Traplines but was omitted because, in Robinson's words, \\"back in the mid-90s, bondage porn didn't belong in a serious fiction collection.\\" It was later included in So Long Been Dreaming, an anthology of postcolonial science fiction and fantasy edited by Nalo Hopkinson and Uppinder Mehan. It was also included in Walking the Clouds, an anthology of Indigenous science fiction edited by Gracle L. Dillon. ==Background== Eden Robinson wrote \\"Terminal Avenue\\" \\"in Vancouver, Canada on the number 9 Broadway bus between Commercial and the University of British Columbia\\" on the third anniversary of the Oka Uprising. The uprising, also known as the Oka Crisis, was a 1990 confrontation between a group of Mohawk people (along with allied Native activists) and Quebec's provincial police force over the proposed construction of a golf course on territory that, according to local Mohawk people, had been sold illegally. The conflict escalated to the point of gun battles between activists and provincial forces, resulting in one fatality (a QP corporal). According to Robinson, \\"It was my spec fic, bondage, aboriginal response to Oka and the Fraser River salmon wars.\\" ==Plot== Set in what appears to be a somewhat futuristic Vancouver, the story is narrated by a Native Canadian man named Wilson Wilson (Wil). In this Canada, Indigenous people have been removed from their lands and ghettoized in urban reservations. There, they face continual brutalization by armored security officers. The armored officers are described as sexless and invulnerable, their voices mechanically distorted to conceal their identities. The story shifts quickly between multiple timeframes. In one, the reader learns that in Wil's professional life, he is a professional submissive at an exclusive BDSM club. There, his lover (unnamed but marked as white), together with others dressed in security officer uniforms, performs sadomasochistic acts on him for an audience. In private, their roles are reversed, with Wil assuming the dominant role, but his lover maintaining the security officer's uniform. In a past timeframe, the reader is told about Wil's father holding an illegal potlatch before being removed from the Douglas Channel area to the urban reservation. For this act, his father is later stopped along the road and beaten nearly to death by security officers. He never recovers psychologically, and commits suicide soon after. Subsequently, Wil's brother, Kevin (the only other named character in the story), participates in the Oka Uprising. After the uprising's failure, he becomes a security officer, and is disowned by his family. The \\"present\\" timeframe is extremely condensed. A group of security officers is approaching Wil, preparing to beat him (at the story's close, presumably to his death). Wil wonders whether perhaps his brother is one of the officers assaulting him. ==References== Category:First Nations literature Category:Science fiction short stories Category:Canadian speculative fiction short stories Category:2004 short stories Category:BDSM literature Category:Vancouver in fiction ","title":"Terminal Avenue"},{"id":"56695465","text":"Geoffrey Toseland (31 January 1931 ‚Äì 16 May 2019) was an English professional footballer who played as a winger for Sunderland.

Born and raised in Zambia's second largest city, Kitwe, she became the first Zambian woman to receive a Rhodes Scholarship and also the first woman to have her portrait displayed on the walls of Oxford University‚Äôs prestigious Rhodes House. After attaining a BA in Politics, Philosophy and Economics at Somerville College, Oxford, Sichone returned to Zambia where she embarked upon a career as a lawyer focused on human rights issues. She represented several displaced villagers who had been accused of squatting, and represented the people in court as pro bono clients. In 1993, Shichone formed the Zambia Civic Education Association (ZCEA).The aim of the association was to spread the gospel of human and democratic rights and to remind Zambians that it was not enough to have democracy on paper, but it had to be practiced. The association formed many civic education clubs within secondary schools around the country ‚Äì her idea was to capture the imagination of the young whilst they could still dream. The association continues to teach citizens rights and civic education to this day. Sichone was also very much into active politics. She joined the United National Independence Party (UNIP) shortly after it had lost to the Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) in the 1991 presidential election. Although she held a number of positions in government, she was often its critic mainly because political office was never her goal. She left UNIP in 1994. == Early life == Lucy Sichone was born on 15 May 1954. She grew up with a father who had been very strict about her education. At some point her father had served as a butler for a British colonial family where he began to take a keen interest in getting his daughters educated. Lucy managed to pursue her education from an all-girls convent secondary school. In 1978 she was accepted at the University of Zambia to study for a law degree. She obtained her degree in 1981 and won a Rhodes scholarship to study for an Philosophy and Economics degree at Oxford University in England. Sichone married her first husband in 1979, after their daughter turned five years old. After the death of her husband she experienced what is called \\"property grabbing,\\" a practice which is still very common in Africa. It is where all household goods are taken by the late husband's relatives.\\"Property-grabbing: Why Zambia Needs Stronger Laws to Protect Widows' Rights,\\" Aids Analysis Africa 4, Number 4 (July-August) 1994, pp. 1, 7Kaori Izumi, \\"Gender-based violence and property grabbing in Africa: a denial of women's liberty and security,\\" Gender & Development 15, Issue 1 (2007), pp. 11-23.

But because of her legal knowledge and experience, she managed to win custody over the children. She had four children. Ten years after the death of her first husband, Shichone married her second husband. == Social activism == Lucy Sichone represented so many clients over a wide range of issues, from government land disputes to personal issues similar to those she had experienced as a widow. The Zambia Civic Education Association (ZCEA) was formed by Shichone in 1993. This was a non-profit human rights organisation which was formed to empower the Zambian citizenry in coping with the democratic dispensation. She wanted this to assist the development of democratic process in Zambia as well as promote justice. This was to be done through increasing and creating awareness among all citizens about their duties and responsibilities under the Constitution. Sichone believed that it is in the execution of duties and responsibilities that bestow rights, privileges and equality for all before the Law. Sichone was never content with just idling by and watching the politicians desecrate the constitution, she decided to go into politics. When everyone else was running towards the Movement for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD), the party that had just won the momentous 1991 elections that removed Kenneth Kaunda from power, Sichone decided to join the United National Independence Party (UNIP). UNIP, having ruled Zambia for 27 years, had lost the 1991 elections and its political fortunes were in decline. But for Lucy, this all didn't matter. Her calculus was probably that an association with UNIP would help spread her message about safe guarding human rights and holding politicians accountable. After all, civil society organizations at that time did not have much of a following. Everyone looked up to politicians. However, she then left the party in 1994 when she started to experience problems with fellow members of the central committee. Sichone began contributing to the independent daily newspaper The Post in 1993. As her columns challenged the Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) government and its manipulation of constitutional provisions. It was during her time at The Post that two memorable events happened that thrust her into the limelight and confirmed her position as the conscience of the nation. In February 1996, Sichone wrote an article titled ‚ÄúMiyanda has forgotten about need for justice‚Äù. Godfrey Miyanda was then Vice President and leader of government business in parliament. An order to arrest Sichone along with the newspaper‚Äôs managing editor and chief editor was issued. Sichone and two of her colleagues, managing editor and chief editor of the paper, were forced into hiding to avoid imprisonment on charges of contempt of Parliament after the Zambian National Assembly. After the order, there was a lot of international pressure from human rights groups, journalists and legal groups to absolve her because she had a three-month-old baby at that time. The other two surrendered to authorities, but Sichone did not and remained hiding. While at large, she continued to write columns for The Post, and declared not submit to National Assembly Speaker Robinson Nabulyato‚Äôs unconstitutional decree. She wrote, ‚ÄúThe freedoms enshrined in the Bill of Rights make it a sacred duty for me to defend them to the death.‚Äù She ended up becoming the first Zambian to win the International Women Media Foundation Courage in Journalism Award in 1996 for the same article for which they were trying to arrest her for. She eventually gave herself up and a sort of truce existed between her and the authorities. == Death and legacy == Lucy Sichone died at the age of 44 at the University Teaching Hospital (UTH) in Lusaka, on August 24, 1998. The Post, where she used to work as a columnist, published a front page memorial article for her, with the headline ‚ÄúZambia mourns Sichone‚Äù. A series of articles ran in The Post after her death, showing the condolences from many political leaders, non-governmental organizations and citizens from the nation. Editor-in-chief of The Post, Fred M'membe, who was also a close personal friend to the late human rights activist, said Zambia had lost one of its daughters. Sichone's death was widely mourned. The civil society movement tried to petition the government to accord her a state funeral but, as expected, the authorities declined. We are all left to wonder what other brave and inspiring things she would have done had she lived longer. Grieve Chelwa, author of the article \\"Lucy Sichone: Conscience of the Zambian nation,\\" wrote in 2015, \\"I had the rare privilege of meeting Lucy Sichone in 1998, the year she died, during a prize giving ceremony for students who had done a lot to advance civic education at their schools. She gave me a certificate carrying her immortal signature and asked all the recipients that day to carry her dream even further.\\" In 2015, Lucy‚Äôs friend and attorney Dr. Ann Olivarius, who established The Rhodes Project to study Rhodes Scholars, commissioned a portrait of Lucy to hang in Rhodes House, the Oxford home of the scholarship. The Rhodes Project also published a recollection of Lucy by her daughter, Martha Sichone Cameron.\\"Memory and perspective: Two accounts of the life of Lucy Banda Sichone,\\" http://rhodesproject.com/lucy-banda-two-perspectives.

The album was released on February 14, 2018 by Epic Records Japan. It features a total of ten songs, including the 2016 single \\"Take Me Out\\". Honey reached number 3 on both the Oricon and Billboard Japan charts. The album was released on March 2, 2018 in Europe and North America by JPU Records. ==Background== According to lead guitarist Mami, Scandal chose Honey as the title because they felt it best described \\"‚Äúsweet‚Äù and ‚Äúsharp‚Äù like a thorn and even ‚Äúpoisonous‚Äù all together.\\" The album's artwork and lyrics also reflect this feeling as well. The artwork was done in collaboration with the band's friends Amiaya. Like their previous album, 2016's Yellow, the members of Scandal wrote and composed all the songs on Honey themselves. However, unlike all their prior material where guitarists Mami and Haruna played mainly the same chords, for Honey they specifically kept them separate. Haruna played the foundation of power chords and low notes, while Mami stuck to single notes. With ten songs total, it is the band's shortest album of their career; they wanted to record only their strongest songs and feel that all ten fit together as a single story. Because lead vocalist Haruna did not write any of the lyrics, she said she was able to fully immerse herself as each song's protagonist and use different voices on each song. ==Themes== \\"Take Me Out\\" was released as the band's 10th anniversary single in July 2016. Mami said it was a rock song made specifically to play live. \\"Koisuru Universe\\" was released as Scandal's first digital-only single in October 2017. Digital distribution was done as opposed to a physical release so that the title track could be heard before their joint tour that same month with the bands Unison Square Garden, 04 Limited Sazabys and Blue Encount. The song was created during their earlier 47 Prefecture Tour which was held from March to July 2017. The lyrics to the single's b-side, \\"Futari\\", were first drafted in summer 2016, while its music was completed at the beginning of 2017. Mami composed it under the influence of instrumental bands and to have a melody as if a guitar was singing. Both songs were intended to sound good live. Lead guitarist Mami composed the music for all but two songs on the album. Mami said that the band wanted \\"Platform Syndrome\\" to be \\"the face of the album\\" and described it as a very energetic rock song. She also explained that with a theme of \\"love songs from the woman's perspective\\", they imagined it and \\"Over\\" as connecting together. \\"Over\\" is a heavy rock track born from wanting a song that begins with guitar that \\"cuts through the air.\\" These were the last two songs recorded, made just one week from their deadline. Each was made in a single day. Mami called \\"Oh! No!\\" a \\"nonsensical song\\" that was written during their previous album, Yellow. She revealed that writing and composing it was easy and natural as she just included \\"whatever was on my mind at that time.\\" For the \\"urban dance\\" number \\"Midnight City\\", drummer Rina sings the verses while Haruna sings the chorus. Bassist Tomomi said she played funky phrases instead of octaves for the \\"disco-like\\" song. For \\"Short Short\\", Rina was inspired by television and books and wrote the lyrics as a short-lived love story. Its title is supposed to suggest it is even shorter than a short story. Mami felt that it is the most emotional song on the album. She said that it is very simple sound-wise and therefore added voices to have \\"color\\". However, Haruna cited it as the most challenging song on the album for her, as she pushed herself to sing more gently than usual. It was actually made about two years prior and uses her vocal take from that time, although some parts were re-recorded. Tomomi wrote \\"Mado wo Aketara\\" in 2015 with no plans to release it. She said that at the time \\"I felt like my soul sort of drifted out of me. I made this song in hopes of holding on to that feeling that I felt at that moment.\\" While making Honey everyone kept telling her to include it, which she admits turned out to be great timing. Because of its personal nature, she asked her friend Mizuki Masuda from Negoto to arrange it. Mami composed \\"Electric Girl\\", which she joked was a \\"weird dance\\" song, while playing around with her instruments. Its lyrics, which begin with onomatopoeia, came to Rina suddenly while taking a taxi home from the studio. The song has some auto-tuned vocals and a bass solo. ==Release== Scandal performing in California in 2018. Honey was released in Japan on February 14, 2018. In addition to a regular edition, a first press limited edition of the album includes a DVD of their 11th anniversary concert, Storytellers: Scandal. Which marked the first time a Japanese band took part in the Storytellers television show. A different limited edition comes with a T-shirt designed by Amiaya. All three have different cover art. The European edition of the album includes lyric translations. A limited edition including a T-shirt and guitar pick was limited to 200 copies. To celebrate the album's release, Scandal held a free concert at Zepp DiverCity on the day of Honeys Japanese release for people who preordered it. The national Honey tour began on March 3 and concluded on May 25. The Asian leg took place in June with shows in Hong Kong, Beijing, Guangzhou, Manila and Taipei. A six-date North American tour took place in September 2018. ==Reception== In a review for JaME U.S.A., Chris N. wrote that with Honey Scandal returned to their garage rock roots but with \\"an emotional maturity and a technical sophistication\\" to their songwriting. He suggested that the only problem with the album might be that it is too short. ==Chart performance== Honey reached number three on the weekly Oricon chart and charted for 11 weeks. It also reached number three on Billboard Japans Hot Albums chart. It reached number two on Billboard Japans Top Albums Sales chart, which is based only on album sales. The album also topped nine charts across Europe, and reached the top 10 in three more. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Scandal *Haruna ‚Äì lead vocals, rhythm guitar *Mami ‚Äì lead guitar, lead vocals on \\"Oh!

They were applied in the foothills and Rocky Mountains of northeastern British Columbia, on the western edge of the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin. Although the names are considered obsolete, their usage persists. The Toad and Grayling strata have yielded fossils of marine organisms, including ammonites, brachiopods, and bivalves. ==Stratigraphic history== The Toad and Grayling Formations were originally described by E.D.

It reaches a maximum thickness of about 460 metres (1500 ft). The overlying Toad Formation is more calcareous and less dolomitic than the Grayling. It consists of dark grey calcareous siltstone and silty limestone, with minor amounts of silty dolomite and calcareous sandstone and, in the lower part, minor thin, randomly dispersed lenses and nodules of phosphate. It reaches a maximum thickness of about 825 metres (2700 ft). ==Relationship to other units== The Grayling Formation unconformably overlies the Permian Fantasque Formation. It is equivalent to the lower Montney Formation in the subsurface of the Peace River plains and to the Phroso Siltstone Member of the Sulphur Mountain Formation in west-central and southwestern Alberta. Its contact with the overlying Toad Formation is gradational. The Toad Formation is conformably overlain by the Liard Formation. North of the Peace River it is overlain, possibly unconformably, by the Ludington Formation, and in the Liard River area it is unconformably overlain by the Fort St. John Group.

Her work has been featured in the NYT Magazine, Rolling Stone, and Ms. She won the 2000 Community Awareness Award from the National Press Photographer's Association, and the 2001 International Prize for Photojournalism. She is a Guggenheim Fellow, Pulitzer Prize nominee, and formerly incarcerated and homeless youth. Kenneally is the founder of A Little Creative Class, a non-profit art organization that works to address the obstacles that deter poor and low-income youth from participation in art and the emerging idea-based economy. ==Early life== Kenneally was born in Albany, New York in the late 1950s, and grew up nearby Troy, New York. Her parents divorced eight years into their marriage. She then moved back in with her mother, and Kenneally's grandmother. Kenneally's grandmother sought out to keep Kenneally from making the same mistakes as her mother, barring her from friends whom her grandmother deemed as bad influences. At the age of twelve, she was declared \\"incorrigible\\" by the Albany County Family Court and declared a ward of the New York State Division for Youth. She began living in group homes and temporary shelters where she became acquainted with the people her grandmother had once forbidden. Kenneally's cynicism of the system, which influence her later works, was learned in these homes, where experiences with abuses preceded criminal behavior. She left the city at the age of 17. She fled to Florida and worked intermittently as a snake charmer in the carnival and as an assistant to photographers Rosalind Solomon and Eugene Richards. She attended the University of Miami after getting sober, studying both photojournalism and sociology. She was introduced by her journalism professor at Miami to Tom Schroeder, the editor of \\"Tropic,\\" the Miami Herald Sunday magazine, which subsequently led to the publishing of her photographs of South Beach, Miami. After graduating from the University of Miami, Kenneally moved to Bushwick, Brooklyn in 1996 to receive a masters in Photography from N.Y.U graduate school. She began photographing her neighbors‚Äô struggles with poverty and drugs. Her photographs from that time are \\"an investigation into the effects of various social and political policies.\\" ==Career== Kenneally began her career in Florida, photographing the economic and racial divisions. She took photos over a seven year period before moving back to New York. She moved to Brooklyn and started photographing people's struggles with drugs and poverty. It was her work in New York that gained her national attention for photography. In 2003, Kenneally began a project she called Upstate Girls. The project was sparked by a teenager named Kayla who approached Kenneally and asked if she wanted to film the birth of her child. She spent the next 14 years photographing Kayla, including taking pictures of her children, family, and friends. Images from the project were posted by Slate in 2014. The images caused a backlash on social media with some people criticizing both Kenneally and Kayla, while others defended them. She is also a recipient of the W.

The Government of Spain is lending the Kenyan government a total of ‚Ç¨142 million (approx. US$174.6 million), to have this line constructed. The contract between Isolux and Ketraco is for a construction price of US$208.1 million. The government of Kenya will provide the balance of approximately US$33.5 million as equity in the power line, along with any associated land acquisition costs. ==Construction== In 2011, the Spanish company, Isolux Ingeniera SA won the contract to construct this power line. Due to a prolonged land acquisition process, work did not actually start until November 2015. Sixteen months into construction, on a project allocated 24 months, the parent company of the main contractor, Isolux Cors√°n, ran out of money and filed bankruptcy in Spain due to the 2008‚Äì2014 Spanish financial crisis. In August 2017, Ketraco terminated the contract with Isolux, with about 30 percent of the work completed. In February 2018, the Kenya government, through Ketraco, contracted a consortium of Chinese firms at a cost of US$96 million, to complete the work left pending by Isolux. Work is expected to conclude in August 2018. The consortium, comprising NARI Group Corporation and Power China Guizhou Engineering Company, has committed in writing to pay US$10 million in fines, for every month the work goes beyond the 31 August 2018 deadline. In September 2018, Reuters reported that construction of the power station was complete and was awaiting testing and commissioning, requiring the power line to be energized from grid to gradually configure the hundreds of turbines. In July 2019, Uhuru Kenyatta, the president of Kenya officially commissioned the completed high voltage line (including a fiber optic line), as well as the wind power station that it serves (Lake Turkana Wind Power Station). ==Capacity charge== In January 2017, the owners of Lake Turkana Wind Power Station started to bill the Kenya Power Company a monthly \\"capacity charge\\" of KSh700 million (approx. US$7 million), for power produced by the power station that cannot be evacuated due to lack a high voltage line to transmit it to the substation at Suswa. Following negotiations, in September 2017, the government of Kenya agreed to pay the developers of Lake Turkana Wind Power Station, a total of Sh5.7 billion (approx. US$55.83 million), in monthly installments, spread over a six year period. The monthly payment will amount to Sh78,600,000 (approx. US$769,833). The monthly surcharge will be passed on to the consumers, beginning in May 2018. ==See also== * Energy in Kenya * Isinya‚ÄìSingida High Voltage Power Line * Suswa‚ÄìIsinya‚ÄìRabai High Voltage Power Line * Bujagali‚ÄìTororo‚ÄìLessos High Voltage Power Line ==References== ==External links== * Website of Kenya Electricity Transmission Company * Lake Turkana Wind Power $52.5m fine pushed to consumers Category:High-voltage transmission lines in Kenya Category:Energy in Kenya Category:Energy infrastructure in Kenya Category:Energy infrastructure in Africa ","title":"Loiyangalani‚ÄìSuswa High Voltage Power Line"},{"id":"56696686","text":"The Ministry of Justice () is the Jordan government agency responsible for Justice of Jordan.http://www.moj.gov.jo/Pages/viewpage.aspx?pageID=123http://www.moj.gov.jo/Pages/viewpage.aspx?pageID=133 == List of ministers == * The Appearance of Ruslan (1921) * Ibrahim Hashim (1922-1926) * Reda Tawfiq (1926) * Sheikh Hussamuddin Jarallah (1926-1929) * Ibrahim Hashim (1929-1931) * Omar Hikmet (1931-1933) * Ibrahim Hashim (1933-1938) * Toufic Abou El Hoda (1938-1940) * Omar Hikmet (1940-1941) * Sheikh Ahmed Alawi Al-Saqqaf (1941-1943) *Samir Al-Rifai (1943-1944) * Mohammed Al Ansi (1944) * Muslim Attar (1945-1946) * Sheikh Fahmy Hashim (1946-1947) * Bishara Ghassib (1947) * Falah Almadadha (1947-1950) * Rawhi Abdul Hadi (1950) * Mohammed Al-Shuraiki (1950) * Abdul Rahman Khalifa (1950) * Sheikh Abdullah Ghosheh (1950-1951) *Hazza' al-Majali (1951) * Falah Almadadha (1951) * Ananas Anastasia (1951-1952) * Aref Al‚ÄìAnbtawi (1952) * Rawhi Abdul Hadi (1952-1953) * Ali Al-Hassan (1952-1953) * Shafiq Arshidat (1953) *Bahjat Talhouni (1953-1954) * Saba the reverse (1954) *Hazza' al- Majali (1954-1955) * Ali Al-Hassan (1955) * Mohammed Ali Al-Jabari (1955) * Falah Almadadha (1955-1956) * Ali Al-Hassan (1956) * Shafiq Arshidat (1956-1957) * Ibrahim Hashim (1957) * Majed Abdel Hadi (1957) * Ibrahim Hashim (1957) * Falah Almadadha (1957) * Ali Hindawi (1957) * Walid Salah (1957) * Ahmed Al Tarawneh (1957-1958) * Mohammed Ali Al-Jabari (1958) * Ali Hindawi (1958) * Mohammed Ali Al-Jabari (1959) *Anastas Hanania (1959) * Anwar Al Nashashibi (1959-1960) * Mohammed Ali Al-Jabari (1960-1961) * Hassan Daoud (1961) * Jacob Moamer (1961) * Ahmed Al Tarawneh (1961-1962) * Hassan Al Kayed (1963-1964) * Bahjat Talhouni (1964-1965) * Abdul Rahim Al Waked (1965) * Awni Abdel Hadi (1966) * Grace Haddadin (1965-1966) * Simon David (1966-1970) * Gamal Al-Nasser (1970) * Vazalrosan (1970) * Leader Mohammed Dawood (1970) * Fawaz Al-Rousan (1970-1972) * Salem Assistance (1972-1974) * Naji Al Tarawneh (1974-1976) * Hassan Al Kayed (1976) * Ahmed Abdul Karim Tarawneh (1976-1979) * Najib Arshidat (1979-1980) * Ahmed Abdel-Karim Tarawneh (1980-1985) * Riad Shaka (1985-1989) * Rateb Al-Wazzani (1989) * Yousef Al-Mubayed (1989-1991) * Majid Khalifa (1991) * Tayseer Kanaan (1991) * Yousef Al-Mubayed (1991-1993) * Rateb Al-Wazzani (1993) * Taher Hekmat (1993-1994) * Hisham El Tal (1994-1996) * Abdulkarim Al-Daghmi (1996-1997) * Riad Shaka (1997-1998) * Jodat Spool (1998-1999) * Hamza Haddad (1999-2000) *Khalaf Masa'deh (2000) * Knight Nabulsi (2000-2003) * Salah al-Din al-Bashir (2003-2005) * Mohammed Ali Alawneh (2005) * Abdul Shakhanbeh (2005-2006) * Sherif Zoubi (2006-2007) * Ayman Odeh (2007-2010) * Hisham El Tal (2010-2011) *Hussein Majali (2011) * Ibrahim Al‚ÄìAmoush (2011) * Selim Zoubi (2011-2012) * Ibrahim al-Jazi (2012) *Khalifah Suleiman (2012) *Ghaleb Zu'bi (2012-2013) * Ahmed Ziadat (2013) * Bassam Talhouni (2013-2016) * Awad Abdul Bakhit Abu Jarad Al-Mashkaba (2016‚Äìpresent) ==See also== * Justice ministry * Politics of Jordan ==References== ==Further reading== ==External links== * Ministry of Justice Defence Jordan ","title":"Ministry of Justice (Jordan)"},{"id":"56696708","text":"Franti≈°ek Hanec Pivec was a male Czech international table tennis player.

The song is also featured in the soundtrack of the 2018 video game Forza Horizon 4. ==Composition== \\"Never Say Die\\" is a downtempo electro song that \\"features robust, linear-patterned synths that maintain the song's energy\\". Despite the band's well-known \\"airy synths\\", there is \\"a more abrasive-sounding synth leads the charge during the bridge leading into the anthemic chorus\\", according to Derrick Rossignol of Uproxx. In a statement, Lauren Mayberry said that it is \\"one of my favorite songs on the record because it really leans into the juxtaposition of what we do‚Äîthe mixture between the dark and the light\\", describing it as \\"melodic and direct but uses some of the gnarliest sounds we've ever tried\\". \\"The chorus lyric came about very quickly but the verses took a lot longer.

Similarly, Winston Cook-Wilson of Spin opined that it features \\"a slinking R&B; feel and a complementary, stuttering vocal cadence from Lauren Mayberry\\" while \\"retaining the band's typical arena-ready dynamics\\". Hayden Wright of CBS Radio deemed the song \\"an intense electro track with Lauren Mayberry's signature pop-friendly vocals\\". Robin Murray of Clash regarded the song as \\"a dazzling return\\" and \\"a deft fusion of light and shade\\", driven by Mayberry's powerful vocal and Kurstin's seismic production. ==Credits and personnel== Credits adapted from Tidal.

He was the first of five children born to James Ferguson de Peyster (1794‚Äì1874) and his second wife, Frances Goodhue (n√©e Ashton) de Peyster (1805‚Äì1871). His father was a widower of Susan Maria Clarkson, with whom he had one child, a half-sister named Susan Maria de Peyster (1823‚Äì1910), who married Robert Edward Livingston (1820‚Äì1889) of Clermont. Through his half- sister Susan, he was the uncle of Goodhue Livingston, the prominent New York architect. Frederic was the only child from his parents marriage to marry and have children. His maternal grandfather was William Ashton. His paternal grandparents were Helen Livingston Hake and Frederic de Peyster who fought for the British crown during the American Revolution and was descended from Arent Schuyler and Abraham de Peyster (the 20th Mayor of New York City). His uncle was Frederic de Peyster. De Peyster prepared for college at the private school of Dr. Dennis. He graduated from College of the City of New York in 1860 with an A.B. degree and later an A.M. degree. He studied law at Columbia Law School, graduating in 1862 with an LL.B. degree, and in 1864 with an LL.M. degree. ==Career== After being admitted to the bar, de Peyster practiced law in New York for many years. He was associated with the firm Tremaine & Tyler. From his father, he inherited a significant fortune, enabling him to avoid being \\"tied down to his professional duties, and much of his time has been spent in the interests of charity.\\" De Peyster, who was \\"deeply interested in historic and patriotic subjects,\\" served as president of the Holland Society, governor of the Society of Colonial Wars, president of the New York Dispensary and chairman of the New York Society Library. He was also involved with the American School of Classical Studies at Athens, serving for several years as the New York trustee and treasurer. He served as treasurer of The Bank for Savings in the City of New-York. ===Society life=== In 1892, both de Peyster and his wife Augusta were included in Ward McAllister's \\"Four Hundred\\", purported to be an index of New York's best families, published in The New York Times. Conveniently, 400 was the number of people that could fit into Mrs. Astor's ballroom. De Peyster was a member of the Saint Nicholas Society, serving as president. During his time as president, he was awarded the Order of Orange-Nassau by Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands. ==Personal life== On October 10, 1871, Frederic was married to Augusta McEvers Morris (1851‚Äì1911), a daughter of William Henry Morris (1810‚Äì1896) and his second wife, Ella (n√©e Birckhead) Morris. Her half-brother was Augustus Newbold Morris. Together, they had a home at 11 East 86th Street in Manhattan and were the parents of: * Helen Van Courtlandt de Peyster (1872‚Äì1923), who married Dr. George Augustus Lung (1862‚Äì1921) in 1908. * Frederic Ashton de Peyster (1875‚Äì1951), who married Alice Abercrombie-Miller (1885‚Äì1965), daughter of James Abercrombie- Miller, in 1908.

Schwartz, a banker and horse breeder, in 1915. They divorced in 1926, and she purchased Crossways, the former villa of Stuyvesant Fish and Marion Anthon Fish in Newport. De Peyster died in Lakewood, New Jersey, where the family vacationed, on May 11, 1905. He was buried in his family's vault in Trinity Church Cemetery. His entire estate was left to his widow and five children with his widow receiving 3/8ths and each child receiving 1/8th. ===Descendants=== Through his eldest daughter Helen, he was the grandfather of George Livingston de Peyster (b. 1909), who married Shirley Tucker Hull (1918‚Äì2014) in 1942.

Written and produced by the band and Steve Mac, it was released by Glassnote Records on 10 April 2018, as the fourth single from the band's third studio album, Love Is Dead (2018). ==Background== The song premiered as Annie Mac's Hottest Record on BBC Radio 1, where the band revealed that it is the only song from the album recorded in the United Kingdom. \\"'Miracle' is the only song from Love Is Dead that we didn't write and record in the States, instead producing it in London with Steve Mac. Steve is such an intuitive writer with such a killer ear for melody and working with him felt very easy and natural. He makes space for everyone in the room and really pushes people to try things and go outside of their comfort zone, in a good way,\\" said Mayberry. ==Composition== \\"Miracle\\" is a pop song consisting of elements from '90s rock music. According to Rolling Stones Jon Blistein, the song features \\"booming percussion cut with laser-like synths\\" and \\"an Imagine Dragons-esque drop\\", with \\"the production moving between sparse, airy verses and a speaker-rattling chorus\\". The chorus has also been described as \\"a faux-EDM breakdown\\", and it contains a lot of \\"woahs\\". ==Critical reception== Lauren O'Neill of Vice praised the song's drop which was \\"blended with enough unexpected elements that it doesn't feel generic\\", noting the influence of bands like The Cardigans and Garbage. Peter Helman of Stereogum did not notice a huge difference in terms of production despite not being produced by Greg Kurstin, who produced most songs from the album, calling it \\"another big pop song, with a 'woah' chant and everything\\". ==Music video== A music video was released for the song on 25 April 2018. It was directed by Warren Fu and shot in one take. In it, Mayberry calmly strolls through a foggy, post-apocalyptic setting in slow motion, as she sings the song. She navigates turbulent streets filled with riots, fist fights, and explosions, before reaching a climax in which a glowing blue heart explodes and Mayberry is splattered with blue paint.

It is mainly found on the east coast of South America, ranging from Cabo Frio, Brazil to Mar del Plata, Argentina. In the past decades, their numbers have depleted and are currently abundant only in the southern limit of its former range. Due to this decline, it is on Brazil‚Äôs endangered species list. It has a slow growth rate and relatively long lifespan. A. stellifera is an omnivorous generalist predator, and modifies the abundance of other invertebrates and algae in subtidal marine communities. ==Anatomy== This type of sea star grows five arms and can reach up to in length, though most stay around . The size is found to vary with depth, larger sea stars are found deeper while smaller ones are usually found in shallow waters. The can be found in a variety of colors, mainly white and brownish, but also can be an orange-red color. All sea stars have tube feet that are controlled by hydraulic pressure. They can be found arranged in grooves along the arms. Tube feet are used to move around, they can attach to all different surfaces, feeding by passing food along the arms and to the mouth which is located at the center of the organism and for respiration. Sea stars do not have gills or lungs for respiration, they rely on their tube feet and papules, or skin gills, to take oxygen out of the surrounding water and move it into their bodies. ==Reproduction== A. stellifera has a defined annual and synchronous reproductive cycle. This cycle is affected by seawater temperature and day- length, they increase chances of fertilization by controlling gametogenesis (a process in which one cell splits to form four more cells). Reproduction is also regulated by planktonic food supply. A. stellifera can reproduce asexually by breaking apart into smaller parts and regrowing the missing limb. This explains why Asterina can be found living with less than five arms. Asterian sea stars also reproduce through dispersal of eggs. At the beginning of reproduction, many starfish belonging to the asteroid species form aggregations, nothing has been researched for A. stellifera but it can be assumed they would also mate like this. It is known that other Asterina species deposit up to 1000 eggs in a specific location in the process of reproduction. They mainly deposit underneath large rocks or corals. Scientists have also found that several males will surround one female during reproduction. From this, we can infer that A. stellifera would do this, but it has not yet been researched fully. ==Ecology== A. stellifera feeds on macroalgae, bryozoans, tunicates, polyps, and biofilm as well as different types of kelp. A. stellifera is one of the few asteroid species found in the rocky coast of the South Atlantic Ocean. They stay in the coastal zones near rocky outcroppings and most can be found around down. The accelerating development of Mar del Plata shoreline for industry, agriculture, and tourism during the last decade is degrading coastal ecosystems by habitat disturbance and pollution. On top of that, the recent arrival of two invasive species into the sea stars last remaining habitat, the kelp Undaria pinnatifida and the sea slug Pleurobranchaea maculata add potential threats. The kelp competes for space, not only the space of A. stellifera but also that of its prey. P. maculata has a large overlap of prey with A. stellifera, decreasing the amount available for the sea star. ==Research== A study was performed to model individual growth and explore the relationship of changes in local abundance with variation in environmental factors and the reproductive status of individuals.Geographical implications of seasonal reproduction in the bat star Asterina stellifera Elsevier, Journal of Sea Research Volume 85, January 2014, Pages 222-232 Pablo E. Merettaa, Tamara Rubilarb, Maximiliano Cled√≥na, C. Renato, R. Venturac. They studied the relationship between male and female organ wet weights with seawater temperature, salinity, monthly mean precipitation, and day-length. It was found that seawater temperature and day- length appear to influence the rapid increase of gonads and it was also found that gamete release failure is not the cause of the scarcity of new sea stars. A. stellifera was also used to explore the structure of the mucous granules in the tube feet of sea stars.The Ultrastructure of the Mucous Granules from Starfish Tube Feet. Elsevier, Journal of Ultrastructure Research Volume 16, Issues 3‚Äì4, October 1966, Pages 259-268. Helenade Souza Santos. Center of Electron Microscopy, Department of Physics, Escola Polit√©cnica, University of S√£o Paulo, S√£o Paulo, Brazil It was found that A. stellifera mucous granules had a rounded profile, which is an indication that they have an ellipsoidal shape in three dimensions. They were also organized in a regular hexagonal array, indicating that there could be some kind of binding material giving the bundle the shape of a hexagonal rod. This was different than what had been previously discovered, electron microscopic studies of various tissues containing mucus-secreting cells all showed a lack of an organized structure. ==References== Echinoderm Research and Diversity in Latin America, edited by Juan Jos√© Alvarado, Francisco Alonso Solis-Marin Springer Science & Business Media, Aug 7, 2012 - Science The role of Asterina stellifera (Echinodermata: Asteroidea) as a predator in a rocky intertidal community in southern Brazil.

It has a single hollow, onion-like leaf and up to fifty small green or yellowish- green, scented flowers. It is similar to Microtis oblonga and some authorities regard the two as being one species. == Description == Microtis rara is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single erect, tapering, tubular leaf long and wide. Between ten and fifty green or greenish-yellow flowers are well spaced along a flowering stem tall. The flowers sweetly scented, long and wide. The dorsal sepal is egg-shaped, long, wide with a dished lower surface. The lateral sepals are linear to oblong, long, about wide with their tips rolled under. The petals are a curved lance shape, long, about wide and spread widely apart. The labellum is more or less oblong, long, wide with notched edges and a narrowed middle section. There are dark green calli in the centre of the labellum. Flowering occurs from November to January and is stimulated by fire the previous summer. ==Taxonomy and naming== Microtis rara was first formally described in 1810 by Robert Brown and the description was published in Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen. The specific epithet (rara) is a Latin word meaning \\"scarce\\", \\"scattered\\" or \\"dispersed\\".

During this period, he was a delegate to its national conference on five occasions, serving on its standing orders committee for five of these. In 1950, Hanley began working full-time for the union, as divisional organiser of its number 12 district. Six years later, he narrowly defeated Edwin Boyce to become executive councillor for division number 5, which covered Sheffield and the East Midlands. He held this seat in 1964, when he beat Boyce by an even smaller margin, being seen as the more right-wing of the two candidates. During this period, he served as staff-side secretary on the Whitley Councils for the Air Ministry and Civil Air Transport.

He is known for serving as the first Finance Secretary of Bangladesh. He was Bangladesh's envoy to the World Bank and later the United Nations for 8 and 11 years, respectively. He has started 4 companies, and is currently chairman of Industrial and Infrastructure Development Finance Company (IIDFC), a Bangladeshi financial services firm. ==Career== Finally, in December, Indian Army forces bolstered by the Mukti Bahini liberated Dhaka, securing the Pakistani Army's surrender on 16 December. By 8 January, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto responded to international pressure and released Sheikh Mujib. He arrived back in Dhaka on the 10th, and sent for Islam on the 12th. By 17 January, Islam was appointed the first Finance Secretary of Bangladesh. ===Government service in Bangladesh=== ====Finance secretary==== As he worked on building the country's financial system, Islam also traveled with Sheikh Mujib and the other heads of government, traveling first to Calcutta for talks with Indira Gandhi and the Indian Foreign minister in February. By March 1972 they were on their way to Moscow by way of Tbilisi, Georgian SSR. In Moscow, they were recognized by the Soviet Premier, Brezhnev and Alexei Kosygin, the Prime Minister. Talks eventually yielded an agreement for the Russians to build a power plant in Ghorashal, as well as to assist in clearing mines, sunken ships and wreckage from the war out of Chittagong Harbor. Later in the year, Sheikh Mujib's delegation would visit Washington D.C. and London, and by September 1972 they had US$400 million in foreign currency reserves and the groundwork of a relationship with the IMF and World Bank. ====World Bank==== Islam joined the World Bank in October, 1973. As Bangladesh's representative, he spearheaded the country's entry into the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and Asian Development Bank. Working as a block with India and Sri Lanka, Islam served as the Alternate Executive Director for Bangladesh while S.R. Sen served as the Executive Director. When Sen died of a heart attack, Islam took over his duties, managing Bangladesh's contributions to the IBRD, IDA, and IFC, the former two of which were both previously managed by Sen. Islam served through July 1977, and campaigned vocally for equal treatment of even the poorest nations. For example, he campaigned against a proposed US Government Accountability Office audit of the World Bank on the grounds that all members of the bank were equal. If the US were to be given the opportunity to audit, then every other country should get that same opportunity. He worked closely with Robert McNamara, then President of the World Bank, to push for aid and assistance in debt restructuring, while in return working to eliminate barriers to foreign investment to make Bangladesh a more attractive investment opportunity. As Alternate Executive Director, he was also charged with ensuring that development projects made it through the bureaucracy with all necessary approvals so that work could begin in earnest. During his time at the World Bank, Islam would return to Dhaka every six months to visit Sheikh Mujib. During the last of these visits, on 7 July 1975, Sheikh Mujib was trying to form his single political party BAKSAL as part of his campaign for one-party rule. He asked Islam to join, but Islam refused because he was a civil servant at heart, and thus had to remain apolitical. Mujib wanted Islam to return to Dhaka to help bolster what he knew was a tenuous position, but Islam refused on account of not wanting to disrupt his daughters' education in the US. Mujib offered to sign indefinite orders to keep Islam in the US, but Islam said he would return in a year. Eight days later, Sheikh Mujib was assassinated Islam finished his tenure with the World Bank in July 1977, and subsequently returned to the Government of Bangladesh as Secretary of Industry. ====Secretary of Industry==== As Secretary of Industry, Islam's job was to focus on the development of Bangladesh's private sector. His most notable achievement in this role was partnering with Dubai Bank, Limited to start Arab-Bangladesh Bank, now AB Bank, on 31 December 1981. However, with the assassination of Ziaur Rahman in 1981, Islam began looking for work away from the instability of the central government. As fate would have it, the Director-General of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization, or UNIDO, was visiting Dhaka at the time. Islam hosted him for dinner, and was offered a job at UNIDO 6 months later. ===UNIDO=== Islam spent twelve years at UNIDO, six in Vienna and six in Delhi. During his time in Vienna, he served as a Senior Industrial Development Field Advisor and liaison between UNIDO and the World Bank. The World Bank was reliant on consultant services provided by UNIDO, and Islam would match up World Bank projects in need of consultants with UNIDO personnel specialized in those areas. In 1987, he transferred to Delhi, and worked as the UNIDO director for India and Bhutan. At no cost India and Bhutan, he would find projects in those countries where UNIDO could contribute expertise and match them with personnel and resources from abroad. He helped to bring foreign direct investment, and led a matchmaking effort to pair investors with local companies. ===Entrepreneurship=== After finally retiring from government/NGO service in 1993, Islam would go on to start three major companies, one of which he is still on the board of. In 1996, he started International Leasing and Financial Services, Ltd, his first non-bank Financial Services company. In 1998, he followed with National Housing and Finance, a non-banking development financial institution. Islam resigned from the boards of both of these companies in 2004 and 2003, respectively, so he could focus on his primary business venture. He started Industrial and Infrastructure Development Finance Company (IIDFC) in 2000 as a Non-banking Financial Institution (NBFI) under the Financial Institutions Act of 1993.http://www.iidfc.com/index.php/home/glancehttp://www.iidfc.com/index.php/home/director_profile As an NBFI, IIDFC cannot open savings or checking accounts, nor can it obtain letters of import. But it can accept term deposits, invest like a bank, and deal in foreign exchange. Since its inception, IIDFC has amassed 16.7 Billion BDT (US$200 Million) in assets as of 2015.http://www.iidfc.com/report/annual_2015.pdf Islam has continued to serve as chairman, and also retains a 3% stake in the company.http://www.iidfc.com/index.php/home/shareholders In 2003, Islam helped to start the Credit Ratings Agency of Bangladesh, or CRAB, by partnering with the Indian Credit Rating Agency, ICRA. He now serves as the vice chairman of CRAB, in addition to his ongoing work as IIDFC Chairman. ==Awards and recognition== In 2010, Islam's company, IIDFC, was awarded the HSBC-The Daily Star Climate Award for Climate Change Mitigation. His company financed Bangladesh's first green brick project, introducing a technology that uses 50% less energy to manufacture bricks. In 2011, Islam won The DHL-Daily Star Lifetime Achievement Award for his aggregate accomplishments over six decades of work in accounting, finance, and international development. ==References== Category:1930 births Category:Living people Category:Bangladeshi businesspeople Category:John F.

Its main office is on Adelaide Road, Murray Bridge. It was later sold to Rural Press, previously owned by Fairfax Media, but now an Australian media company trading as Australian Community Media. ==History== Murray Bridge's oldest locally produced newspaper, The Murray Valley Standard, was first published in Murray Bridge on 23 November 1934. Its main rival at the time was the Murray Bridge Advertiser (a sub-publication of the Mount Barker Courier), which soon sold its local rights to Maurice Parish. From 21 December 1934, the subtitle changed to \\"With which is incorporated 'The Murray Bridge advertiser' and 'The Mannum mercury'. From 5 June 1942 the words 'Murray Bridge advertiser' were omitted from the masthead, and from 6 June 1958 'The Mannum mercury' was also omitted from the sub-title. Its first owner was former Liberal M.P. and Murray Bridge's first mayor, Maurice Parish, who purchased the printing business of Bert Lawrie in 1934. In 1950 Parish sold the newspaper and printing business to his editor, Frank Hambidge. In 1967, Hambidge retired, handing over management to his son Michael Hambidge, and the Standard became the first South Australian country newspaper printed by the Web-Offset method. By 1955, 2500 copies of the Standard were being printed weekly, and circulation was up to 7,450 in 1971. Rural Press first bought shares in the newspaper in 1986, assuming full control in December 1994, and was itself purchased by Fairfax Media in 2007. ===Southern Review (supplement)=== The Southern Review (12 May 1972 ‚Äì 23 March 1973) was a short- lived supplement (only 20 issues were released) that was printed in Murray Bridge for five country newspapers, namely: The Islander, Murray Valley Standard, Pinnaroo & Border Times, Southern Argus, and Victor Harbour Times. ==Distribution== The Murray Valley Standard distribution covers an area of over 28,000km2, from Meningie, Swan Reach, Mannum. Tintinara, Callington. Lameroo, Kanmantoo, and Karoonda. It has a claimed weekly readership of 7,100. Originally weekly, the Standard published twice-weekly in 1973, and has published on Tuesdays and Thursdays since 1981.

Geoff's work was first recognized in the early 1970s when he published the book Friday Night in the Coliseum, featuring his photographs of professional wrestling and recorded conversations with wrestlers and fans. The book was followed in 1972 by a 16mm, black and white documentary film of the same title. Over the course of his career he has received two Guggenheim Fellowships, five grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, and numerous commissions. He has lived in Houston, Texas and taught photography in the Department of Visual and Dramatic Arts at Rice University since 1969. In addition, he directs the Pozos Art Project, Inc., a non-profit enterprise offering art and photography opportunities to children in Texas and in Mexico. == Early life and education == Geoff Winningham was born on March 4, 1943 in Jackson, Tennessee. At the age of 13, he became fascinated with cameras, immersed himself in photography, found a part-time job as a studio and darkroom assistant, built a darkroom in his family home, and made his first photo-book, a handmade volume of portraits of his friends. At the age of 14, he left home to continue his secondary education as a boarding student at Battle Ground Academy in Franklin, Tennessee. In 1961 he moved to Houston, Texas, to study at Rice University, majoring in English literature. While studying at Rice he renewed his interest in photography, encouraged by several English professors, most notably Professor Gerald O'Grady, his first and most important mentor. After earning his bachelor's degree from Rice, he entered the Master's program at the IIT Institute of Design in Chicago, Illinois, where he studied with Aaron Siskind, Arthur Siegel, and Wynn Bullock, completing his MS degree in 1968. == Books == * In the Eyes of Our Children: Houston, An American City, Houston: Pozos Art Project, 2017. * Of the Soil: Photographs of Vernacular Architecture and Stories of Changing Times in Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR: University of Arkansas Press, 2014. * Going Back to Galveston: Nature, Funk and Fantasy in a Favorite Place, College Station, TX: Texas A&M; University Press, Text by J.

Pinkus Kartin (pseudonym: Andrzej Szmidt; 1914 - 20 May 1942) was a Polish-Jewish communist activist and anti-Nazi resistance fighter. ==Biography== Kartin was born in Lutsk. He joined the Young Communist League of Poland at a young age and later the Communist Party of Poland (KPP). Around 1936‚Äì1937 he went to Paris to study at the Sorbonne. In January 1938, Kartin went to fight in the Spanish Civil War in the ranks of the XIII International Brigade. After being wounded, he returned to Paris in April 1939, where he edited Dziennik Ludowy, a Polish-language communist newspaper banned by the French authorities. Kartin was recognized as a Soviet citizen when his birth town of Lutsk was incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1940. In 1941 he went to the Soviet Union and received military training. At the end of 1941 Kartin was parachuted into the Warsaw area, tasked with building an underground communist party and an armed resistance force in order to fight the German occupants. Kartin was charged with organizing the underground communist party and combat units inside the Warsaw Ghetto. In February 1942 Kartin and J√≥zef Lewartowski met with Mordechai Anielewicz and other leaders of the Jewish Combat Organization. As a result, the Anti-Fascist Bloc was formed in March 1942. Kartin was also a founding member of the Polish Workers' Party in 1942 and trained partisans for Gwardia Ludowa. In May 1942, Kartin was arrested by the Gestapo and taken to Pawiak Prison in Warsaw, where he was interrogated and then murdered. It later emerged that a Gestapo agent who had infiltrated the Polish communists was responsible for his arrest. Posthumously, Kartin was awarded the Order of the Cross of Grunwald in 1945. ==References== Category:1914 births Category:1942 deaths Category:People from Lutsk Category:Communist Party of Poland politicians Category:Gwardia Ludowa members Category:Polish Jews Category:Polish people of the Spanish Civil War Category:Polish Workers' Party politicians Category:Recipients of the Order of the Cross of Grunwald Category:Resistance members killed by Nazi Germany Category:Jewish Polish politicians Category:Jewish resistance members during the Holocaust Category:Jewish socialists ","title":"Pinkus Kartin"},{"id":"56697573","text":"The 1943 All-Service football team was composed of American football players who were selected as by various organizations and writers as the best football players at their respective positions who were serving in the military and playing on military service football teams in 1943. ==Ends== * Bob Fitch, Camp Lejeune (AP-1) * Jack Russell, Blackland (AP-1) * Perry Schwartz, Iowa Pre- Flight (AP-2) * George Poschner, Ft.

It is the third and final installment in the Transformers: Prime Wars Trilogy. It consists of the toy line, as well as the animated web series Transformers: Power of the Primes. Development of the franchise began in November 2016 with the announcement of an animated web series by Machinima, based on the upcoming toyline. In January 2017, Hasbro held a fan-vote to decide which character would become the next Prime in the franchise. In February, it was decided that Optimus Primal would become the next Prime. ==Development== The franchise was first announced on November 29, 2016 as the third and final installment of the Prime Wars Trilogy. Hasbro announced that it would once again partner with Machinima‚Äîafter having previously worked with them on the animated web series adaptation of Transformers: Combiner Wars‚Äîto produce the adaptations for Transformers: Titans Return and Transformers: Power of the Primes. Eric Calderon, showrunner of Combiner Wars, was confirmed to have returned for both Titans Return and Power of the Primes. In January 2017, Hasbro created a poll allowing fans to vote which Transformer will become the next Prime. The vote occurred in two stages. During the first, fans voted for the leaders of three different personality factions; honor, order and chaos. Honor was represented by Arcee, Ultra Magnus and Hound; Order by Megatron, Star Saber and Shockwave and Chaos by Thunderwing, Optimus Primal and an Unknown Evil (Deathsaurus). The winners of the first round were Ultra Magnus, Star Saber and Optimus Primal, advancing into the second round alongside the Unknown Evil as a wildcard. The poll ended a month later on February 18, and Optimus Primal was chosen as the next Prime. At the 2017 San Diego Comic-Con on July 20, Hasbro revealed during their panel some of the figures of the toyline. The figures shown were those of Liege Maximo, Dreadwind, Blackwing, Starscream, Jazz and Rodimus Prime. During Hasbro's first HasCon fan convention in September, the new Combiner Volcanicus was revealed. The combiner is composed of the five Dinobots: Grimlock, Slug, Sludge, Snarl and Swoop. ===Controversy=== In November 2017, a fan noticed that a tiny print found on the vehicle mode of Jazz featured scribbles that, when translated from the Cybertronian alphabet, read out \\"MAGA\\", which is an abbreviation for \\"Make America Great Again\\", the slogan of President Donald Trump. Hasbro soon released a statement that the issue had been investigated and that a vendor had placed the acronym without authorization. The company also clarified that they are addressing the issue with the vendor and that they \\"do not intend for [their] products to carry political messages, apologiz[ing] to anyone who was offended by this message\\". ==Animated series== ==Comic book== According to John Barber, editor of IDW Publishing, the ongoing Transformers comics published by the company will not feature a crossover event based on Power of the Primes. IDW had previously published crossover events based on Combiner Wars and Titans Return. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Transformers (toy line) Category:Transformers: Prime Wars Trilogy Category:Transmedia storytelling ","title":"Power of the Primes"},{"id":"56697602","text":"Naing Ko Ko (; born 5 July 1980) is a Burmese politician who currently serves as a House of Nationalities member of parliament for Kachin State ‚Ññ 12 Constituency.

Most of its fighters were from the Muslim minority of Baganda, whilst others were non-Baganda Muslims. The group was formed in response to the Museveni government's alleged mistreatment of Muslims in Buganda. ==History== The UMLA formally declared war on Yoweri Museveni's Ugandan government in January 1995. In February 1995, the group launched its first military operations near Lake Albert, which failed and resulted in their retreat to Zaire (present-day the Democratic Republic of Congo). Museveni denounced the rebels as Islamic fundamentalists, whose sole purpose was to destabilize the Great Lakes Region as \\"agents of [Sudan's] NIF government\\". The self-proclaimed purpose of the UMLA was to topple Museveni's government and stop the alleged mistreatment of Muslims in Buganda by them. The UMLA claimed that Museveni's National Resistance Army (NRA) had committed war crimes and massacres against Muslims during the Ugandan Bush War, a claim which Museveni denies. The UMLA merged with the Allied Democratic Movement, remnants of the National Army for the Liberation of Uganda (NALU) and followers of the Islamic sect Tablighi Jamaat to form the Allied Democratic Forces in 1996, allegedly with the assistance of the Sudanese government.Prunier, 87.

The cause of the incident was Selim III's attempt to expand the New Order's permanent presence into Rumelia through the establishment of New Order barracks in the region's cities. The ultimate outcome of the confrontation was the retreat of imperial forces back to Istanbul and to Anatolia, constituting a deathblow to Selim III's ambitions of expanding his reformed army, as well as a major blow to his legitimacy. The outcome of the Edirne Incident would play no small part in his deposition the following May. == Causes == At its core, the Edirne Incident is a reaction to Selim III's establishment of the New Order army following the Ottoman's overwhelming defeat in the Ottoman Russian War 1787-92. This army was break from Ottoman military tradition and was based on western military principles. The army was met with heavy opposition from entrenched power groups, notably the Janissaries and the ayans, who saw the New Order as a threat to the established order of things, as well as from many in the wider public who detested the introduction of conscription, never before used in the empire, and the subsequent tax increases needed to outfit the new force. Many also felt that the new force was un-Ottoman in its nature and constituted a concession to the west. == Incident == thumb338x338px Tekirdaƒü and √áorlu In April 1806, under the guise of sending an expeditionary force against Serbian rebels in Belgrade, Selim III ordered Kadi Abdurrahman Pasha to take his 24,000 troops into Thrace and establish New Order barracks there, ostensibly to protect the populace from the Mountaineers, a general term for organized Balkan banditry. The first attempt at this task was in the city of Tekirdaƒü and was immediately met with violent opposition from the populace. The local kadi refused to take part in establishing the barracks and though promptly replaced, his replacement and all his retinue were lynched by a mob of mostly janissaries after reading out the imperial orders on the subject. To further aggravate matters, the city refused to admit the New Order into the city or to turn over those responsible for the murders. Subsequently, the central government sent two corvettes to blockade the city, to no effect, before authorizing them to bombard it. Under this onslaught the city finally capitulated in July. This was only a small part of Kadi Abdurrahman Pasha's troubles in Thrace however. Throughout the spring and summer, the leading ayan of Edirne, Daƒüdevirenoƒülu Mehmed, had been rallying opposition to the New Order under the rationale that it would mean the undermining of traditional Janissary and ayan privileges in the region. Under his ad hoc command, according to the British consul of Bucharest, 186 local ayans signed a secret agreement to resist the New Order and to overthrow Selim III and, in his place, install the future Mustafa IV. Importantly, this received the support of Ismail of Ruse, one of the most powerful figures in the Ottoman Empire and whose retinue included future Grand Vizier Mustafa Bayraktar, as well as the current Grand Vizier Hafiz Ismail Aƒüa. Ismail of Ruse had been an early supporter of the New Order and ostensibly claimed to support its mission, thus his secret change of heart dealt a serious blow to Selim III's ambitions. This agreement encouraged the violence against the New Order as they faced attacks on their supply lines and received no provisional support from the towns and cities along their path. The threat of large scale civil war also loomed on the horizon as Rumelian ayans rallied their forces which the French ambassador to Istanbul, Horace S√©batsiani, estimated to number around 80,000 men. Against these obstacles, New Order troops were forced to halt their progress in Havsa in mid-July, after fighting a force of Janissaries, before retreating to the town of √áorlu in the east where further retreat was only prevented by the appearance of Selim III himself. Even there though, they were only able to enter the town after besieging it. As the situation worsened the Porte became distinctly aware of the danger that the incident presented and began to close dozens of coffee shops in the capital in an attempt to prevent the rebellion from spreading into Istanbul. In mid- August, Ismail of Ruse was assassinated on his farm by an associate and while welcome news to the New Order, Selim III, on September 19, ultimately decided to order his troops to leave Silivri and return to Istanbul. Due to mediation spearheaded by local ayan, and suspected rebel, Ismail of Serres, an escalation in the conflict was prevented. == The Aftermath == Though the center attempted to spin the return of the New Order as an example of Selim III's generosity to his subjects in avoiding a civil war, it was in fact an incredible humiliation for the Sultan and a deathblow for his ambitions of centralization and reform. Following the incident, a reshuffling of the cabinet occurred with collaborators as well as \\"New Orderist\\" officials replaced by more conciliatory figures. The Grand Vizier was replaced by the Agha of the Janissaries Ibrahim Hilmi Pasha, the Grand Mufti dismissed, and Kadi Abdurrahman Pasha dismissed. No serious attempts were made after this point by the Sultan to expand the New Order which was eventually disbanded during his deposition in a futile attempt to appease the rebels. == References == Category:Conflicts in 1806 Category:1806 in the Ottoman Empire Category:History of Edirne ","title":"1806 Edirne incident"},{"id":"56697856","text":"Orest Grechka (born 20 December 1975) is a Ukrainian-American former soccer player who is also known to have played for Moss FK of the Norwegian Premier League from 2000 to 2001. ==Norway== He went to Norway after playing for Hannover 96 II in Germany.

For example, the 4-page Kangaroo Island Courier (1907-1951), a weekly newspaper which was issued on the island on Saturdays. In June 1951, it was incorporated by the Glenelg Guardian, and a later separate insert version of that newspaper, The K.I. Courier (1957-1968) was also published by the Glenelg Guardian. The first issue of The Islander was on 19 January 1967, continuing weekly until 4 August 1982. The newspaper quickly went on to absorb its main rival publication, The K.I. Courier. Between 11 August 1982 (issue No. 754) and 27 May 1987 (No. 994) it was briefly renamed as the Islander News Pictorial. The newspaper was sold to Rural Press (formerly part of Fairfax Media) in 1995.

The general conditions of contest used by the United States Bridge Federation can be found here. There are multiple events in the USBC including Open, Women, Seniors, and Mixed divisions. This page contains information about the Open division in which anyone of any age or gender can compete. ==History and vocabulary== From May 17‚Äì21 of 1989, the \\"team trials\\" to determine which team would represent the United States was held in Memphis, TN. At that time, the trials had no name, and the name \\"United States Bridge Championship\\" was conceived by Matt Guagliardo, who was then the Director of Education for the ACBL, but was still actively involved in promoting bridge. Mr. Guagliardo, in collaboration with Barbara McBride, who was also the graphic artist for the ACBL, created the USBS logo, which was flag-shaped with a dark-blue square in the upper-left corner, with a white star, and a black spade inside the star. The words \\"United,\\" \\"States,\\" \\"and \\"Bridge\\" are in red, and are stacked vertically opposite the square. The word \\"Championship\\" is also in red, and is lengthwise below the blue square, and other verbiage. There is a blue line underneath the word \\"Championship,\\" and a blue line extending from the right border of the square over the word \\"United.\\" T-shirts were printed and given to the caddies, who worked the sectional tournament that ran concurrently to the USBC, to wear. On the front, the T-shirts had the USBC logo, \\"Memphis, Tennessee\\" and \\"May 17‚Äì21, 1989.\\" The back had printed in blue, in an arc shape, \\"A BIG DEAL FOR MEMPHIS,\\" with four Aces printed below it, each with a different suit designation. The words and cards are all printed in blue. Concurrent with the USBC was a sectional tournament, and the concluding event was a Swiss Teams, which was the norm then. In cooperation with the late Ralph Cohen, something was done, at least for the first time in the United States, and, quite probably, the world. This is what happened: The last round of the sectional Swiss Teams had \\"boards\\" (\\"hands') that were duplicated before the Swiss Teams began by Ralph and his small hand-picked group, and kept under ultra-tight security. Thus, in the last round of the \\"Swiss,\\" at every table everyone was playing the same set of hands. Immediately after the Swiss event ended, players adjourned to a large room, where, on Vu-Graph, they were able to see the same set of hands played live by contestants in the USBC. The showing of the hands was accompanied by expert commentary. Like the USBC itself, the concept of having the hands played by \\"ordinary\\" players in a competitive environment, then being able to see those same hands played by world-caliber experts was conceived by Matt Guagliardo. The previous history was grossly inaccurate, and t-shirts autographed by players who competed in the 1989 event, and who are now deceased, give evidence that the term \\"United States Bridge Championship\\" was coined more than a decade before the formation of the United States Bridge Federation. ==Summary of past USBCs== Below is a table of teams that have won the Open USBCs and how they fared in international competition. In every odd number year, the winners of the USBC Open division get to compete in the Bermuda Bowl that has existed since 1950. The events in the even number years vary between the World Bridge Games and a Transnational Event.

It resulted in thirty-four arrests, sixteen charges of sodomy, and twelve trials, five of which possess transcripts. ==Raid== On February 21, 1903, at nine o‚Äôclock at night, two undercover officers entered the building of the Ariston Bathhouse. Their names were Thomas Phelan and Norman Fitzsimmons. Since the building had been under surveillance via insistence by the police, it is known that at least one police officer, Norman Fitzsimmons, had entered the establishment at least twice prior to the police raid. Twenty minutes after arrival, according to his court testimony, Phelan was approached sexually by a man named Walter Bennett. After Bennett turned down Fitzsimmons's request to join, on the basis of Bennett preferring ‚Äúfat boy[s]‚Äù, they arranged to meet later at 2:30 a.m. Shortly afterward, two other undercover officers joined Phelan and Fitzsimmons. They spent some time observing the bathhouse to gather evidence to incriminate individual patrons, and witnessed multiple instances of anal and oral sex, which they later recounted at the trials. At 1:45 a.m., a group of police officers entered the establishment and blocked the exits so that none of the seventy-eight men inside could escape. They went through the men and found the individuals who they possessed complaints against, and arrested thirty-four men. The rest were let go with a warning. The proprietor of the bathhouse, John Begley, was accused of keeping a disorderly house and was held in $2,000 bail. Of the men arrested, some were charged with liquor law violations and disorderly conduct, and at least sixteen were charged with sodomy. Twelve of those sixteen were sent to trial, and five trials have transcripts that survived and are viewable today. Of these five trials, three returned verdicts of guilty, one verdict of guilty with a recommendation to mercy, and a mistrial. However, two of the guilty verdicts were later appealed. It is known that police had spent several weeks collecting evidence against men who entered the bathhouse, which they did in conjunction with the Society for the Prevention of Crime. They used this evidence to create two diagrams of the bathhouse, which were used in the trials that followed. ==Trials== In the trial of People v. Kregel, the defense relied on the physical impossibility of sodomy. The defendant, Andrew Kregel, was a tailor who was married with five children. At his trial, Andrew Kregel was said to have entered the bathhouse around 1:00 a.m. where he was approached by a man named Charles Chamberlin. The prosecution continued to describe that Chamberlin had performed anal sex with Kregel, while another man, John Rogers, performed oral sex on Kregel. All three were arrested by police about an hour later. However, Kregel denied the testimony about the alleged sex acts, and maintained that he had never been to a Turkish bathhouse before and that he received the ticket to the bathhouse from a customer at his shop in exchange for fixing a coat. At that point, Dr. Pierre A. Siegelstein was called by the defense attorney to the witness stand. He told prosecutors that he had testified in two prior sodomy trials, and that anal sex performed by two men standing up was physically impossible due to physiological reasons. A medical expert specializing in sex crime cases, William Travers Gibb, refuted this claim, and said that upright anal sex was feasible. Eventually, it was declared a mistrial and Kregel's bail was reduced from $2,000 to $750. In People v. Galbert, the defense attorney cited the ‚Äúphysical impossibility‚Äù and ‚Äúmathematical impossibility‚Äù of the crime. An employee from the bathhouse was called as a witness, and said that the couches present in the room where Galbert was found were a little more than a foot high, and Charles LeBarbier, Galbert's attorney, suggested that the couches were too low to permit the accused crime to take place. Galbert was an architect for Carrere and Hastings, a prominent firm that lead the Beaux Arts movement. Because of this, John Carrere, an accomplished architect, was called to attest to Galbert's mental health along with four other character witnesses. When Galbert was found guilty, LaBarbier used his resistance against the police during his arrest as a testament to his manliness and masculinity. In People v. Schnittel, Arthur C. Butts, Micheal Schnittel's defense attorney, attempted to defend his client by providing evidence of Schnittel's heterosexuality. He was accused of performing oral sex on another man by police, as well as walking about the bathhouse wearing a sheet the same way that a woman might. He was also accused of having a venereal disease due to his face having broken out in large, blotchy patches of red. His defense claimed that Schnittel had entered the bathhouse in an effort to clear up the skin condition. Schnittel himself claimed that he had never been in the room where the alleged sex acts took place, and his defense attempted to cement his masculinity by pointing out his engagement ring. In the end, the jury returned a verdict of guilty as charged. In People v. Bennett, Walter Bennett's defense attorney also cited his client's heterosexuality and desire for women as proof that he was innocent. The police accused him of wearing a sheet as a woman might, as well as engaging in oral and anal sex with another man. To testify against this, two women and a minister who knew Bennett were called. One of the women, Catherine Bolton, said that she had known Bennett since he was fourteen years old and implied that she had been romantically involved with him at some point. The prosecuting attorney claimed that the feminine perspectives of the women and the minister were not a good indication of Bennett's character, and went on to imply that Bennett was not unlike the women himself. In People v. Casson, Theodore Casson denied the charge of sodomy placed against him, but did admit to being in the Turkish bath, where he was arrested. The officer who arrested him claimed to have arrested him shortly after the accused act took place, which caused a direct conflict of testimony. The jury returned a verdict of guilty with a recommendation to mercy. == References == Category:LGBT history in New York City Category:1903 in New York City Category:1900s in LGBT history ","title":"Ariston Bathhouse raid"},{"id":"56698817","text":"Zoosystema is a peer-reviewed scientific journal published by the National Museum of Natural History, France (Mus√©um national d'histoire naturelle), covering research in animal biodiversity.

Some Iraqi officials even claim that they are supported by Peshmerga and the Kurdistan Regional Government, though this was denied by the latter. * According to other sources, the White Flags were formed as union of various insurgent remnants, including Kurdish Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant forces, Ansar al-Islam remnants, Ba'athists affiliated with the Naqshbandi Army, Saddam Hussein loyalists, and Jamaat Ansar al-Sunna members. Per this version, they are probably not connected with the Kurdistan Regional Government in any way. * Bill Roggio, the managing editor of the Long War Journal, said the group could possibly be a re-branding attempt by Ansar al-Islam or simply a mix of Islamist fighters unaffiliated with external organizations or even a Kurdish movement to oppose the Iraqi government. He commented that \\"if the White Flag is independent of the Islamic State, I seriously doubt it will emerge as ISIS 2.0,\\" adding \\"While the Islamic State has lost overt control of territory in Iraq, it still remains a potent guerrilla force with plenty of manpower and resources to threaten the state.\\" * The Iraqi government has stated that the White Flags are a front organisation of Ansar al-Islam. == Organisation and tactics == The White Flags are considered to be a terrorist organization by Iraqi officials. In late 2017, an Iraqi-Turkmen MP accused Kurdish leaders of supporting the group. This was denied by the Kurdistan Regional Government.

Jute was an effective joint sealant when the pipes carried coal-based town gas, but natural gas, used since the 1950s in New York and the 1970s in the UK, dries out the jute. A fifty-year life expectancy of the new seal has been proven in studies by Cornell University. ==Description== CISBOT is in diameter, is long, weighs , and is deployed with a truck containing the control unit, which is attached to the robot with a tether for the power, communication, and control cables, as well as sealant tubing. It is capable of repairing pipe. CISBOT is introduced into a pipeline through a hole and can repair the joints with an anaerobic sealant for a distance of while the pipe is still in operation. External repair without the robot would require the arranging of temporary gas supply to customers through tanks, purging the pipeline of gas, then digging up each joint, usually every , repairing the joint, and re-covering the pipeline. The cost of internal robotic repair is approximately 25% of manual resealing and 10% of total pipeline replacement. The robot was developed by ULC Robotics of Hauppauge, New York with cooperation from Con Edison and National Grid and costs approximately $1 million. ULC announced the robot in 2015; however it has been in use since at least 2010 and by mid-2012 had sealed over 5000 joints. CISBOT has been used in the United States in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Staten Island, Rhode Island, and Boston. In Europe, it has been used in London and Glasgow by SGN. ==Operation== A flange is first attached to the pipe, through which CISBOT drills an access hole. It then rolls into the pipe and propels itself on two wheels down the pipe. It can travel up to per minute. Upon reaching a joint, it rotates 360¬∞ within the pipe to apply the sealant, using its third perpendicular wheel. It drills holes into the joints through which it injects the sealant.

These sponges are distributed by the central Kuroshio current and are therefore localized along this current. Like many other sponges, D. calyx are very porous. They use the pores in their outer walls to draw in water which they then expel, retaining the nutrients dissolved in the water to nourish themselves. To keep water flowing in and out, the flagella that line their pours beat in either direction. The sponge is most known and used for a molecule that can be extracted from it called calyculin A, which is a colorless oil used in a variety of different studies in modern medicine. ==Taxonomy== D. calyx belongs to the Animalia family. Its phylum is Porifera, which is characterizes it as a sponge. D. calyx belongs to the class demospongia and the order tetractinallida. The family that it belongs to is theonellida. Finally, the correct binomial nomenclature for this species of sponge is Discodermia calyx, which indicates its genus and species.http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=190926 D. calyx has no colloquial name, as it is known primarily in scientific and medicinal contexts. ==Use in research== D. calyx is one of a few sponges that contain the molecule known as calyculin A. This well-studied toxin was discovered originally in D. calyx. When it was first studied it was discovered to be a phosphatase inhibitor, it stops an enzyme that dephosphorylates proteins within the cell. Calyculin A was studied in an experiment that used breast cancer cells. The toxin extracted from this primitive species enhanced the phosphorylation of cyclin D1. This caused the degradation of cyclin D1, which leads to arrest in cell cycle progression in the breast cancer cells. This, among other studies established calyculin as a phosphatase inhibitor.http://www.mdpi.com/2072-6651/3/1/105xml This toxin, and therefore this species, among others with similar toxins, became increasingly studied and important in medicine, particularly relating to chemotherapy. In a later study, scientist concluded that the calyculin A, from D. calyx, also blocks calcium influx by blocking non-selective ion channels in the cell.http://www.mdpi.com/2072-6651/4/10/940/htm Later research looked into D. calyx as a species to look at the natural mechanisms that can be used to regulate the toxicity of calyculin A. Scientist found regulation through phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. These among other studies focus on regulation of the toxin as a characteristic of the sponge Discodermia Calyx because of its implications in the fight to cure cancer. == References == Category:Tetractinellida ","title":"Discodermia calyx"},{"id":"56699054","text":"St. Therese Church, west of Beattyville, Kentucky, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012.

The earthquake had an estimated magnitude of 5.8 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of VII (Very strong). The epicenter was near the Oregon/Washington state line approximately northwest of Milton-Freewater, Oregon and southwest of Walla Walla, Washington and was felt throughout the Pacific Northwest, including as far away as Bonners Ferry, Idaho near the Canadian border and by seismographs as far away as San Diego, California. ==Geology== Larger earthquakes like the 1936 State Line earthquake are not uncommon along the Olympic-Wallowa Lineament, a series of faults stretching from Port Angeles, Washington to the Wallowa Mountains in northeast Oregon. Another earthquake estimated near a magnitude 6 struck the Walla Walla valley in 1882. The earthquake occurred in the Touchet Ridge, a spur leading west off the Blue Mountains that is known as the Horse Heaven Hills west of the Wallula Gap. There is both the old fault along the ridge as well as a newer fault leading from the ridge into the valley. To the north of the earthquake is the Hite Fault, which lies approximately parallel to the west slopes of the Blue Mountains in Walla Walla County. The Hite Fault is thought to be the boundary between the more stable North American craton to the east and accreted material to the west. While there is no evidence of a Quaternary earthquake event along the Hite Fault, the USGS and several Washington state agencies have run scenarios regarding a future earthquake on the fault. There have been 66 earthquakes felt in the area since 1936. Most of these have had a magnitude below 4, though one event in November 1991 was 4.3. ==Earthquake== The ground near Milton-Freewater exhibited cracks over an area that was long by up to , one of which being long and wide in places. Near Umapine there were cracks in the ground up to wide that had water flowing out of them, demonstrating soil liquefaction. Some cracks were deep. Residents in Umapine reported being woken during the night. Wells in Milton-Freewater saw in increase in water level and a creek near town, which had previously ran dry, began flowing immediately after the earthquake. Observers in Walla Walla noted rumbling noises immediately preceding the first shocks. At one point the ground dropped by . About 70% of headstones at a nearby cemetery were found to have been rotated clockwise. Two small foreshocks were recorded in the three hours before the main shock. ===Damage=== Severe damage was widespread throughout Milton-Freewater, Walla Walla, and Athena forcing people to evacuate their homes due to large cracks found within their walls. Rocks were reported to have wandered into some intersections and two freight cars were shaken off the tracks at Blue Mountain Station in Dayton. The shaking was reported as being strongest near State Line. Very strong shaking occurred in Milton-Freewater, breaking windows and collapsing chimneys that had been built longer than ten years previous to the earthquake. Up to $3,000 ($53,000 in 2018) in damage was done to canned goods as well as $8,500 ($151,000 in 2018) in damage to school buildings. A new home west of town was nearly destroyed, and extensive damage was dealt to two cement homes that had been built around 1916 about west of town. In Umapine a handful of homes were badly damaged. The grade school and high school, which were joined, were found to be separated by . Chimneys on roofs collapsed in numerous locations, as far away as Waitsburg. Pendulum clocks stopped in Umatilla and plaster was found to have been cracked in Prosser. ===Aftershocks=== Over 50 aftershocks were recorded intermittently until mid-November 1936. Several dozen were felt the night of the event in the immediate area, with only three of them reaching to Hermiston. These earthquakes occurred in both Washington and Oregon, owing to the close proximity of the main shock to the state line. Aftershocks measuring IV on the Mercalli scale were recorded in August, with the ones that struck in November being measured as III. ==See also== *List of earthquakes in 1936 *List of earthquakes in the United States ==References== ==Further reading== * ==External links== Category:1936 natural disasters in the United States Category:1936 earthquakes Category:Earthquakes in Oregon Category:1936 in Oregon ","title":"1936 State Line earthquake"},{"id":"56699099","text":"Spot delivery (or spot financing) is a term used in the automobile industry that means delivering a vehicle to a buyer prior to financing on the vehicle being completed.

He died after a controversial car accident where his car collided with a military vehicle. == Early life == Raif Denkta≈ü was born on January 26, 1951 in Nicosia to Aydƒ±n and Rauf Denkta≈ü, the founder and the former President of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. He attended to the K√∂≈ükl√º√ßiftlik Primary School which was later renamed as ≈ûehit Tuncer Primary School following the death of his primary school teacher during the 1963 intercommunal violence between Turkish and Greek Cypriots. Before graduating from T√ºrk Maarif Koleji in 1969, he studied a part of his secondary education in TED Ankara College and in Kadƒ±k√∂y Maarif College during his father's exile in Turkey. Denkta≈ü fought during the 1963 incidents at the age of 12. He was also on military service for the 22nd Squad as a high school student from 1968 to 1969. He returned to his squad temporarily in 1974 after the coup d'√©tat organised by the Greek Junta and stayed until the completion of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus. == Academics == Raif Denkta≈ü received his bachelor's degree in public administration from the Middle East Technical University, followed by a master's degree in political science from the University of Oxford. Denkta≈ü received an offer from the latter institution to complete his PhD in sociology of politics in 1982, however he opted to return to Cyprus and pursue a political career. He taught in Eastern Mediterranean University from September 1985 to his death in December 1985. == Political career == In the 1976 General Elections he was elected for the Federated Assembly as a National Unity Party MP. Even though he worked as the Secretary General, he resigned from the NUP in 1981 citing a difference in views. He founded the Alliance of Patriotic Intelligentsia in 1982 and the Social Democratic Party on December 30, 1982. He represented his party at the Founding Parliament of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus as an MP, following the establishment of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus in 1983. He also changed his affiliation to the broader Social Democracy Group but had to reverse this move due to legal complications. Denkta≈ü was known as a strong critic to his father. Regardless of this, he was appointed by him as the Political Adviser to the President in 1985. He also opposed heavily to the government and the National Unity Party during the preparations of the constitution. As a Kemalist, he wrote many articles on Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk's ideas but fiercely supported independence over a possible annexation by Turkey. He was also known for endorsing the Cyprus peace process. His visit to the southern part of the Cyprus in 1984 along with the Communal Liberation Party leader ƒ∞smail Bozkurt and the Secretary General of the Republican Turkish Party, Naci Talat Usar was reported as the first visit by Turkish Cypriots since their displacement in 1974. This visit was criticised heavily by the nationalists and the visitors were called as \\"traitors\\" by Birlik newspaper. == Musical career == Raif Denkta≈ü played the bass guitar for the school band of TED Ankara College where two of his compatriots were also playing. Upon his return to Cyprus, he joined Bayrak Kuartet in 1968. The band was supported by the army personnel and they practised at the basement of the headquarters of the 22nd Squad where Raif was deployed. In 1969, Sƒ±la 4 was formed by Raif, Ferahzat G√ºrsoy, Erdin√ß G√ºnd√ºz and Aydƒ±n Kalfaoƒülu. Raif sang and played bass guitar for the band. Sƒ±la 4 is regarded as the most influential music band which has shaped the Turkish Cypriot music, combining folk tunes and lyrics together and arranging them to the contemporary context. Raif Denkta≈ü composed many different songs including Gariban and Ayrƒ±lƒ±k which was not only popular in Cyprus, but also in Turkey. == Death == During 1985, Raif Denkta≈ü was subjected to many criticism and alleged defamation by both the Turkish and the Turkish Cypriot press. Many different news, composed of hoaxes were being published including claims that Raif was hiding H√ºseyin Kocaba≈ü, a Turkish assassin at his home or he was drug trafficking in Cyprus. National Intelligence Organization of Turkey later admitted that the stories were fabricated by their agents and the agents were fired. Raif's father Rauf, claimed that he was attacked for not agreeing to Turkey's political demands at that time. Two weeks after the claims on drug trafficking were published, he sustained fatal injuries in a car crash near Cihangir on his way back from Famagusta after lecturing at the Eastern Mediterranean University on December 24, 1985.

The building plans received final approval on May 8, 2020. Construction is expected to begin in 2021 or 2022. When completed, the skyscraper would become the second-tallest in Chicago after Willis Tower. ==History== Tribune Tower and the adjacent Chicago Tribune printing plant (from the south) Tribune Tower sits on the southwest corner of property that includes four buildings and a surface parking lot. The other buildings are (clockwise) the four-story 1935 WGN Radio building, the eleven- story 1950 WGN-TV building, and the old Chicago Tribune printing plant, with the parking lot immediately east of all of these buildings. The Tower itself was declared an official Chicago landmark by the city in 1989. In early September 2016, prospective buyers of the Tribune Tower property had redevelopment plans for the adjacent Pioneer Court that were at odds with local interests to protect views of Tribune Tower. Nonetheless, later that month, Tribune Media sold Tribune Tower and adjacent property totaling , including the surface parking lot, to the partnership. At the time of the purchase, the partnership of Los Angeles-based CIM Group and Chicago's Golub & Co. sought input on how to redevelop the properties, although 42nd District Alderman Brendan Reilly noted that he would protect views of the Tower from the Michigan Avenue Bridge to the south and the Ogden Slip to the east. By 2017, there were expectations that the parternership would plan a skyscraper tower to the east of Tribune Tower, even though no plans had been made public. In January 2018, plans emerged for a skyscraper on the northern portion of the parking lot on the east side of the Tribune Tower property. Plans called for 220 hotel rooms and 158 condominium units; the tower would be slightly shorter than the Trump International Hotel and Tower. The new skyscraper is being designed by Adrian Smith + Gordon Gill Architecture of Chicago. As an employee of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, Adrian Smith had designed Trump Tower and the Burj Khalifa, which became the tallest building in the world in 2010. Originally envisioned at and standing nearly three times as tall as the 36-story Tribune Tower, the Tribune East Tower may still face opposition for obstructing views of the Tower, as well as \\"dwarfing\\" it from a historical perspective. Plans were officially announced for a tall 200-unit hotel, 439-apartment and 125-condominium building on April 16, 2018. These plans make the building shorter than the Willis Tower, the city's tallest. The proposal outlined several details, including funding earmarked for affordable housing and neighborhood opportunity as well as plans for the rest of the Tribune Tower property. At the time of its initial proposal, the planned building had no official name, but it was referred to as Tribune East by the media. On mid- October 2018, the Chicago Plan Commission approved the plans for the city's second tallest building. Chicago City Council approved the plans in an October 31 meeting. Minor revisions were unveiled on November 20, 2019, and on May 8, 2020, the project received final approval and construction is expected to begin in late 2021 or early 2022. ==See also== *List of tallest buildings in the United States ==Notes== ==External links== *Tribune East at Emporis *Tribune East Tower at SkyscraperPage Category:Central Chicago Category:Condo hotels in the United States Category:Proposed buildings and structures in the United States Category:Proposed skyscrapers in the United States Category:Hotels in Chicago Category:Residential condominiums in Chicago Category:Residential skyscrapers in Chicago Category:Skyscraper hotels in Chicago ","title":"Tribune East Tower"},{"id":"56699213","text":"Skredkommissionen (Swedish for \\"landslide commission\\") was a commission established in 1988 to research, develop and provide information about landslides in Swedish.

Meanwhile, both the Joker and Batman are revealed to have survived, the former now sane and with no memory of his old self while the latter, unable to fight crime due to his injuries, names Batgirl his temporary replacement as Gotham's defender until he recovers. Following the Injustice League's defeat, Commissioner Gordon restores order to Gotham while Harley begins to develop feelings for Ivy. Concurrently, Doctor Psycho leaves the crew and attempts to conquer the world on his own, taking control of a Parademon army. To stop him, Harley joins forces with the Justice League, Gordon, and the Joker; reluctantly restoring the Joker back to his former self in the process. While the League defeat the Parademons, Harley and Ivy defeat Psycho, but he reveals a memory of them sleeping together, right before Ivy's wedding with Kite Man. Though Ivy and Kite Man attempt to continue on, after Gordon busts the wedding, Kite Man realizes Ivy does not love him and breaks up with her. While running from Gordon together, Ivy finally admits her feelings for Harley. ==Cast== ===Main=== * Kaley Cuoco as Harley Quinn * Lake Bell as Poison Ivy, Cheryl * Alan Tudyk as Joker, Clayface, Calendar Man, Doctor Trap, Condiment King * Tony Hale as Doctor Psycho, Felix Faust * Ron Funches as King Shark * Jason Alexander as Sy Borgman * J.

Veja o Trailer! On December 8, 2019, the first episode was shown as a special presentation on TBS. Season 1 started airing on Syfy on May 3, 2020.

The website's critical consensus reads, \\"A strong voice cast and an even stronger grasp of what makes its titular antiheroine so beloved make Harley Quinn a violently delightful‚Äîand surprisingly insightful‚Äîaddition to the DC animated universe.\\" Season 2 has an approval rating of 100% based on 16 reviews with an average rating of 9.0, and a critical consensus stating, \\"Harley Quinn maintains its frenetic energy and humor while doubling down on the shenanigans and giving its titular anti-heroine even more room to play.\\" On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 82 out of 100, based on reviews from 7 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". Caroline Framke of Variety wrote: \\"The animation feels like that of a typical Saturday morning cartoon, but its acidic scripts and shocking bursts of gore reminds you that Harley Quinn is taking full advantage of airing on a streaming service without censors. [...] Sharp voice performances across the board from actors clearly relishing the chance to play in this world also prove too fun to resist. [...] Most importantly, Harley gets to be an entire person all her own, as heartbreakingly naive as she is wickedly strange and funny.\\" Robyn Bahr of The Hollywood Reporter wrote: \\"It's one of the best surprises of the year. [...] 13 zippy, violent and irreverent half-hour episodes. [...] The writing is frequently uproarious, chock full of Millennial nostalgia and cerebral gallows humor (the former may be low-hanging, rapidly-perishable fruit, but at least the show knows how to embrace its audience).\\" ==Home media== The first season was released on DVD on June 2, 2020 by Warner Bros. Home Entertainment. The first two seasons will also be released on Blu-ray in a box set by Warner Archive Collection.https://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Harley-Quinn-The-Complete- First-and-Second-Seasons-Blu-ray/275071/ Digitally, the first two seasons are also available for digital purchase on Prime Video and iTunes. ==References== ==External links== * Harley Quinn at DC Universe * Category:2010s American adult animated television series Category:2010s American black comedy television series Category:2010s American LGBT-related television series Category:2019 American television series debuts Category:2020s American adult animated television series Category:2020s American black comedy television series Category:2020s American LGBT-related television series Category:American adult animated action television series Category:American adult animated comedy television series Category:American adult animated superhero television series Category:American adult animated web series Category:Animated Batman television series Category:Animated television shows based on DC Comics Category:DC Universe (streaming service) original programming Category:HBO Max original programming Category:English-language television shows Category:Harley Quinn in other media Category:LGBT-related animated series Category:LGBT-related animated web series Category:Supervillain television shows Category:Television series about abuse Category:Television series by Warner Bros.

Though created at the impetus of officials in the German-backed Protectorate government, it evolved to promote a distinctive form of \\"Reich- loyal\\" Czech nationalism that was viewed with concern by some quarters of the Nazi Party. Following World War II, it was banned as a fascist organization and its principal leaders put on trial. ==History== The Board of Trustees for the Education of Youth (or Kuratorium) was established in 1941 partly on the initiative of Colonel Emanuel Moravec to provide athletic and cultural activities for Czech youth between the ages of ten to 18. Many Kuratorium leaders were functionaries or supporters of the fascist Vlajka and Livia Rothkirchen has characterized its programming as an effort at Nazi indoctrination. However, Tara Zahra has noted that at the group's camping trips and other retreats for Czech boys and girls a special focus was made in celebrating Czech culture, with Sicherheitsdienst informants reporting to the German authorities that a kind-of \\"Reich-loyal\\" Czech nationalism was being organically developed by the Kuratorium. Kuratorium fanfare trumpeters pictured at the Week of Czech Youth in 1944. Moravec was chair of the Kuratorium throughout its existence, while the organization was operationally managed by the Czech physician Franti≈°ek Teuner. Following World War II, the Bene≈° decrees proscribed the Kuratorium as a \\"fascist organization\\". In 1947, leaders of the Kuratorium were tried over their involvement in the organization, resulting in the conviction of Teuner and seven others: Eduard Chalupa, Jan Svoboda, Josef Victorin, Karel ≈Ωalud, Jiri M√°lek, Vaclav Krigar, Jaroslav Krigar, and Karel Mihaliƒçe.

In Prague alone its concerts, films, and exhibitions are visited by 13,000 children every day. It has arranged 13 great sports meetings in which 30,000 boys and girls took part. It has taught 80,000 children to swim. Some 200,000 have actively participated in its 'Art for Youth' competition, and 20,000 have been entertained at free holiday camps\\". The Kuratorium's nationalist-oriented programming reached a zenith in the summer of 1944 when the \\"Week of Czech Youth\\" was staged in Prague, activities during which included thousands of Kuratorium participants attired in Czech national costume singing traditional Czech songs. Observers from the Hitler Youth came to the conclusion that Kuratorium activities had essentially become nothing more than a continuation of the banned Sokol movement and were concerned that \\"Reich-loyal\\" Czech nationalism would transform into a dangerous \\"double-edged sword\\". On the one hand, the existence of the Kuratorium showcased Germany's supposed tolerance for Czech institutions and helped educate Czech youth towards an anti-communist worldview, however, on the other hand it severely undermined the ultimate goal of Germanizing the population of the Czech lands. ==See also== * National Partnership * Pioneer movement * Scouting ==References== Category:Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia Category:1941 establishments in Europe Category:1945 disestablishments in Europe Category:Youth organizations established in 1941 Category:Organizations disestablished in 1945 Category:Fascist organizations ","title":"Board of Trustees for the Education of Youth"},{"id":"56699593","text":"William Whateley (2 November 1794Birmingham, England, Church of England Baptisms, Marriages and Burials, 1538-1812 ‚Äì 15 November 1862) was an English barrister.

K. Organisation, one of India's largest conglomerate company. He was born to a Marwari Bania family in Kanpur, then part of the North-Western Provinces in British Raj. He was the founder of several companies which came under the umbrella of JK Organization. The first major business set up by him was a cotton mill with the name of Juggilal Kamlapat Cotton Spinning & Weaving Mills in 1921 which laid the foundation for JK Organisation. ==Early life== Kamlapat Singhania was born to Juggilal and Chandribai Singhania on 7 November 1884 in Kanpur. He was born into an occupational community of merchants, bankers, money-lenders, traders and dealers. His father was a successful businessman and belonged to the Singhania family of Singhana. He joined the family business and assisted his father in expanding the business from traditional money-lending operations to trading in areas such as cotton, pulses and sugar cane. In 1918, the business was split between Kamlapat and his brothers ‚Äì Banke Bihari and Radha Kishan. In the split Kamlapat received the Kanpur family house along with some cash. ==Business career== Kamlapat decided to start a cotton mill as opposed to being selling agents for established mills, as the Singhanias had been until then. Kamlapat secured a loan with the aim of setting up a cotton mill. Along with his father's contribution he established Juggilal Kamlapat Cotton Spinning & Weaving Mills in 1921. JK Cotton Spinning & Weaving Mills produced cotton cloth and yarn and was a successful venture. He went on to set up several mills ‚Äì Kamla Ice Factory in 1921, JK Oil Mills in 1924, JK Hosiery Factory in 1929, JK Jute Mills in 1931, MP Sugar Mills in 1932, JK Cotton Manufacturers Ltd in 1933 and JK Iron & Steel Co Ltd in 1934. Kamlapat constructed a new building - Kamla Tower - across street from the family's Kanpur residence in 1934. Kamla Tower became the headquarters of Kamlapat's expanding organization and housed the offices for various companies he founded. The building was inspired by the design features of Big Ben. It is still operational and serves as the headquarters of JK Cement. ==Later life and death== In 1935, Kamlapat and his family moved from Kanpur residence to a newly constructed 20-acre bungalow near the Ganges called Ganga Kutir (Ganga Cottage). He also purchased a second property from an Englishman, which was named Kamla Retreat. Kamlapat died in 1937 and was survived by his sons ‚Äì Padampat, Kailashpat and Lakshmipat. ==Family history== As per records of JK Temple Kanpur, Vinodi Das Singhania left his home in Singhana ‚Äì a little town in the Jhunjhunu district of Rajasthan ‚Äì in 1775. He resettled in Farrukhabad, a small business town near Kanpur. He started off as a Banker and diversified into trading. This was the time when East India Company was entering India. His sons ‚Äì Ramsukhdas and Sarbsukhdas ‚Äì later joined the family business and opened branch offices in Kanpur, Kolkata, Varanasi and Mirzapur. After Ramsukhdas and Sarbsukhdas, the business was passed on to Ramsukhdas' son, Sewaram. Baldeodas took over the reins of the business along with his brother Munnalal from his father Sewaram. During this time the family also earned the royal title of 'Rajah Sahib'. Baldeodas had six sons and among them was Juggilal who took over the family business and played an important role in expanding and diversifying the business from bankers and traders to industrialists. In 1905, Juggilal and his family shifted to their Kanpur house after a division in the family business which then owned two flour mills ‚Äî the Ganges Flour Mill and Cawnpore Flour Mill ‚Äî apart from being the sole selling agents for Elgin Mills, Cawnpore Cotton Mills and Victoria Mills. The division created two new business units ‚Äì Baldeodas-Kedarnath and Baijnath-Juggilal. ==Personal life== Kamlapat married Rampyari Devi and they had three daughters and three sons: Padampat, Kailashpat and Lakshmipat Singhania. ==Legacy== JK Organisation founded by Kamlapat is one of the largest conglomerates in India today, with multiple million and billion dollar companies under its belt. Several of these companies are listed publicly and have market capitalization in upwards of billion dollars. Some of the publicly listed companies are JK Tyre, JK Cement, JK Lakshmi Cement, JK Paper, Jaykay Enterprises, JK Sugar, JK Agri Genetics (JK Seeds) and JK Dairy (Umang Dairies). Privately held companies of the group are Raymond Group, J.K. Ansell, JK Technosoft, JK Fenner, Global Strategic Technologies and Dwarkesh Energy. Kamlapat founded the Merchants' Chamber of Uttar Pradesh in 1932. Kamla Nagar in Kanpur ‚Äî a township for JK employees ‚Äì is named after Kamlapat Singhania. A number of institutions founded by members of Singhania family bears his name. Some of them are LK Singhania Education Centre at Gotan, JK Lakshmipat University, JK Institute of Radiology and Cancer Research at Kanpur, Lala Kamlapat Memorial Hospital at Kanpur, JK Institute of Applied Physics and Technology (University of Allahabad) and JK Institute of Sociology and Human Relations (University of Lucknow).

Thomas Forrest Cotton FRCP (4 November 1884 ‚Äì 26 July 1965) was a Canadian cardiologist. He introduced electrocardiography to Canada and England and was the first to recognise the relationship between finger clubbing in adults with acquired structural heart disease and infective endocarditis. His paper on clubbing in endocarditis is considered by cardiologists as a classic. ==Early life and family== Thomas Cotton was born on 4 November 1884 in Cowansville, Quebec, to Cedric and Harriet C. Cotton.Thomas Forrest Cotton. Munk's Roll, Royal College of Physicians. Retrieved 27 February 2018. Cedric was a small-town physician. After completing his early medical education at McGill University, Cotton travelled to Europe to do house jobs. There, he worked with the big names of the time, Friedrich Kraus and Georg Nicolai, co-authors of the first textbook of electrocardiography, and later, with Friedrich von Muller in Munich and Karel Wenckebach in Vienna. He then spent a short time in postgraduate training in the United States before moving to University College Hospital, London, in 1913, where he worked with Sir Thomas Lewis. In 1928, Cotton married Dr. Mary (Molly) Marshall, then a clinical assistant at the National Heart Hospital. They had no children. ==Cardiology career== Despite the age difference and distance between the two, Sir William Osler supported Cotton's postgraduate activities in England and abroad. Cotton later wrote, \\"the gates were opened wide for me to enter; a letter to Lewis from William Osler was all that was required to make life seem at its best\\".Thomas Forrest Cotton 1884‚Äì1965 F. 1931. National Archives. Retrieved 27 February 2018. Cotton briefly returned to Montreal General Hospital, where, in 1913, with the assistance of Osler's influence and financial contributions, Cotton was able to persuade the hospital to purchase an electrocardiograph. Cotton, as a result, became Canada's first electrocardiographer. Finger clubbing At the onset of the First World War, Cotton enlisted in the Canadian Army and re-joined Lewis at the Military Hospital, Hampstead, which had been established to carry out research into heart diseases in soldiers. It was at Hampstead that his path crossed with William Osler, Mackenzie, Clifford Allbutt, Caler, Meakins, Parkinson and Drury. In 1913 and 1917, he published ten papers in Heart, eight of which were co-authored with Lewis. During his assignment in 1917 at the Sobraon Military Heart Hospital in Colchester, England, Cotton became interested in finger clubbing. He found that clubbing of fingers in adults known to have structural heart disease was a common clinical finding in infective endocarditis. His paper on clubbing in endocarditis is considered by cardiologists as a classic. Following postmortem information on men with \\"acquired structural heart disease\\" and clubbing, Cotton stated that although clubbing was not \\"a conclusive sign of infection, it is nevertheless one of the most valuable signs we possess in coming to a correct diagnosis\\". As a result, he was the first to recognize clubbing of the fingers as a sign of infective endocarditis. In 1922, he was one of four men who founded the Cardiac Club in London. ==Death and legacy== Thomas Cotton room Cotton was an active member of the Osler Club of London. He had prospered from Canadian investments and following his death at the age of 80 on 26 July 1965, the Royal College of Physicians received a substantial bequest in his will. His ashes were concealed alongside those of Sir William and Lady Osler in the Osler Library at McGill. His respected chief Osler is remembered in the dining room, named as Cotton had wished, the Osler Room, and in an annual Osler oration. In return, the College honoured Cotton by putting up a plaque in the Osler room and establishing a separate room (known as the \\"Thomas Cotton Room\\") to house the library, archives and other possessions of the Osler Club.The Thomas Cotton Room.

It was originally passed as a ballot initiative by voters in 1972 and revised several times by the state legislature. The definition of public records, especially concerning the state legislature, was subject to several legal challenges in the decades since the law was passed. In 2018, a county judge ruled that legislative records and communications were subject to public disclosure, after a lawsuit was filed by media outlets. In response, the state legislature appealed the ruling and introduced a bill that would exempt their records from the act. The bill was passed by the legislature but was vetoed by Governor Jay Inslee after public outcry; the lawsuit was subsequently ruled in favor of the media outlets and upheld by the Washington Supreme Court. The act is listed in the Revised Code of Washington as Chapter 42, Section 56. ==Background== The Washington Coalition for Open Government (COG) was formed from several political groups in June 1971 to push for public disclosure legislation. The state legislature had debated laws on campaign disclosures repeatedly beginning in 1963 and passed an open meetings law in the 1971 session, but avoided addressing public records. The coalition drafted a \\"package\\" of \\"right-to-know\\" legislation in an initiative that was filed in March. The initiative, labeled Initiative to the People 276, raised questions of constitutionality from State Attorney General Slade Gorton, but was allowed onto the November 7 ballot. Initiative 276 was passed by 72 percent of voters, but attracted immediate legal challenges. The initiative became law and took effect on January 1, 1973. Prior to the initiative's passing, the state legislature passed a law in 1971 defining legislative records as \\"correspondence, amendments, reports, and minutes of meetings\\". ==Legal challenges== ===Records on privately owned devices=== In 2015, the Washington Supreme Court ruled unanimously in a case against Pierce County Prosecutor Mark Lindquist that records created on personal devices are public records if they pertain to public business. The Court established a process for reviewing mixed records to identify and release public records. The California Supreme Court also cited the Lindquist ruling in a similar case. ===State legislative records=== In early 2017, journalists from The Seattle Times and Northwest News Network filed public records requests for the calendars of Democratic House Speaker Frank Chopp, Senate Democratic Majority Leader Sharon Nelson, Republican Senate Majority Leader Mark Schoesler, and Republican Minority Leader Dan Kristiansen, related to the ongoing debate on education funding in the wake of the McCleary decision. The Times reported that lawmakers who had once voluntarily released records, such as emails and calendars, declined during recent sessions over the education funding debate, citing an exemption in the 1971 public records definition. Other media outlets filed records requests for all 147 members of the state legislature during the 2017 sessions, but were rebuffed or redirected to lawyers. Other public records requests related to sexual harassment and misconduct allegations levied against state legislators were also denied. On September 12, 2017, the Associated Press and other Washingtonian news organizations filed a lawsuit against the state legislature over the alleged exemption for daily schedules, emails, text messages, and other correspondence related to legislative work. The lawsuit was heard in the Thurston County Superior Court, where a judge ruled in favor of the media coalition, finding that the offices of individual legislators were subject to the Public Records Act. The law would, however, not apply to administrative offices in the state legislature, under the judge's ruling. The ruling was upheld by a 7‚Äì2 decision of the Washington Supreme Court on December 19, 2019, but administrative offices were excluded from the definition of state agencies. While the state legislature appealed the ruling, a bill to remove the legislature from the Public Records Act was announced by state legislators on February 21. The proposed bill allowed limited release of lawmaker calendars and final disciplinary reports beginning July 1, but exempted retroactive records, as well as policy development records and potentially private information. It was given a committee work session and public hearing less than 24 hours after being announced in a bid to hasten its passing. On February 23, the bill was passed by the State Senate 41‚Äì7 and State House 83‚Äì14, less than 48 hours after becoming public and with only four legislators speaking during the debate. In response to the bill's passing and impending action by Governor Jay Inslee, The Times and twelve other large newspapers in Washington state published front-page editorials urging Inslee to veto the bill. For The Times, it was the first front-page editorial to be published in 110 years, the last being a call for wealthy businessmen to support the then-upcoming Alaska‚ÄìYukon‚ÄìPacific Exposition in 1908. By Wednesday, February 28, over 8,000 emails and 4,300 phone calls were received by the Governor's Office in opposition of the bill's signing. In an interview with on MSNBC's All In with Chris Hayes, Governor Inslee said that he was opposed to the bill but stated that the bill's \\"veto-proof majority\\" would prevent him from blocking it. On March 1, Inslee vetoed the bill, citing public outcry and calls from lawmakers who regretted the bill's accelerated passage. ==See also== *Freedom of information in the United States ==References== ==External links== *Chapter 42, Section 56 of the Revised Code of Washington *Washington Public Records Act at Ballotpedia *Guide to Public Record Act by Municipal Research and Services Center * Category:Freedom of information legislation in the United States Category:Washington (state) statutes Category:2018 in Washington (state) ","title":"Washington Public Records Act"},{"id":"56699752","text":"The Martin County Courthouse in Inez in Martin County, Kentucky was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006.

He was a prominent figure in the field of child abuse prevention. He co- founded the Osler Club of London while he was a medical student at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London and later wrote a biography of Sir William Osler. After qualifying from St Bartholomew's, he became a paediatrician with the Emergency Medical Service during the Second World War. He became one of England's early neonatologists at the Queen Charlotte's Maternity Hospital, after which he held a position as senior physician in the children's department at St Bartholomew's and eventually head of its department, remaining there until retirement. Franklin was a member of Council of the Royal College of Physicians, president of the British Paediatric Association and president of the British Society for Medical History. Subsequently, he became president of the International Society for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect (now the Association of Child Protection Professionals). ==Early life and family== Alfred White Franklin, also known as \\"the bishop\\", was born in London on 2 June 1905, to Philip Franklin, an Ear, Nose and Throat surgeon in Wimpole Street, and Ethel Julia. After completing his early schooling at The Hall School, Hampstead, he attended Epsom College, where he was a prefect, studied the classics and won numerous prizes including the Engledue Essay and Rosebery English Literature Prize. In 1943, Franklin married Ann Vaisey, daughter of Francis Vaisey, a clerk in holy orders. They had four children. Franklin's work on child abuse and neglect was most likely encouraged by his wife, who was a social worker and magistrate. ==Medical training and the Osler Club== Franklin received a scholarship to study medicine at Clare College, Cambridge. In 1926, whilst at Cambridge, he went on a transatlantic trip to Canada and the USA with the Cambridge University Medical Society and became enchanted by William Osler, the 'Oslerian legacy' and \\"the value\\" of maintaining \\"cooperation between the English speaking peoples\\". A year later, as a medical student at St Bartholomew's Hospital, Franklin was the Lawrence scholar and a gold medallist. Here, he became good friends with Walter Reginald Bett. In their plans to form a student club of medical history, Franklin had wished to name it after his hero, Sir Clifford Allbutt. However, Bett had his own ideas and took Franklin to visit Sir William‚Äôs home in Oxford and spoke to his [Sir William's] nephew, Dr. Francis. Franklin noted in his diary that \\"during that morning I was infected, as Bett planned, with the virus of Oslerolatry\\". Franklin had co-founded this elite 'Osler Club', which then met and dined regularly at Franklin's home in Harley Street, where he lived with his father. He graduated from St Bartholomew's in 1933. ==Career== Between 1934 and 1935, Franklin was Temple Cross research fellow at Johns Hopkins Hospital, returning to St Bartholomew's as assistant physician in the children's department. ===Neonatology=== Franklin became one of the UK's earliest neonatologists, assisting under Alan Moncrieff at Queen Charlotte's Maternity Hospital. During the Second World War, he worked at Hill End and St Alban's Hospitals as a paediatrician for Sector 3 of the Emergency Medical Service. ===Appointments=== He was elected a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in 1942, followed three years later by his appointment as physician to the children's department at St Bartholomew's Hospital, of which he became head in 1965. Franklin held his teaching sessions in the hospital ward playrooms and was described in Munk's Roll as having an \\"intuitive understanding of the problems and distress, both emotional and practical, suffered by the family of a sick ‚Äì perhaps mortally ‚Äì or handicapped child\\". Franklin was a member of the college council from 1966‚Äì69, president of the British Paediatric Association from 1968‚Äì69 and president of the British Society for Medical History from 1974‚Äì76. Between 1970 and 1978, he was Deputy Chairman of the Attendance Allowance Board of the Department of Health and Social Security. Later, he became president of the International Society for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect from 1981‚Äì82. Franklin was Osler orator in 1971 and he remained in close contact with the Osler Library of the History of Medicine at the McGill University, Montreal. He later wrote a biography of William Osler. ===Child protection=== Franklin was one of the first to recognise that child abuse was much more common and serious in the United Kingdom than the public realised and that the cooperation between the different professions involved was inadequate. Franklin argued that perpetrators of child abuse could only be stopped if, like sufferers from leprosy and venereal disease in the past, society allowed them to come into the open. His approach was instrumental in bringing together doctors, social workers and lawyers to coordinate investigations into child abuse. He established a working party that initiated the Tunbridge Wells Study Group in 1973, a small interdisciplinary group that sowed the seed of the now large British Association for the Study and Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect. ==Later life== Franklin spent his later life deeply involved in child protection and working to prevent child abuse. He continued to edit numerous books on child abuse, kept his interest in medical history and carried on writing on child matters. He died on 20 September 1984, while on holiday in Italy. ==Selected publications== His publications include; ===Authored=== * Pastoral paediatrics (1976) * Widening horizons of child health: a study of the medical health needs of children in England and Wales (1976) ===Edited=== *The care of invalid and crippled children (Oxford University Press, London, 1960) *World-blindness or specific developmental dyslexia (Pitman Medical Publishing Company, London, 1962) *Cancer report 1948-1952 with M P Curwen (E & S Livingstone, Edinburgh & London, 1963) *Children with communication problems (Pitman Medical Publishing Company, London, 1965) *Selected writings of Lord Moynihan (Pitman Medical Publishing Company, London, 1967) *Assessment and teaching of dyslexic children with Sandhya Naidoo (London, 1970) * The Tunbridge Wells study group on non-accidental injury to children: report and resolutions (Tunbridge Wells, 1973) (compiler) *Concerning child abuse: papers presented by the Tunbridge Wells study group on non-accidental injury to children (Churchill Livingstone, Edinburgh, 1975) * The challenge of child abuse: proceedings of a conference sponsored by the Royal Society of Medicine, 2‚Äì4 June 1976 (1977) *Child abuse: prediction, prevention and follow up (1977) *The abused child in the family and in the community: selected papers from the second international congress on child abuse and neglect, London, 1978 with C Henry Kempe and Christine Cooper (1980) *Family matters: perspectives on the family and social policy (1983) == References == Category:1905 births Category:1984 deaths Category:Neonatologists Category:British paediatricians Category:British neonatologists Category:British medical historians Category:Child abuse in the United Kingdom Category:Fellows of the Royal College of Physicians Category:Medical doctors from London Category:Alumni of Clare College, Cambridge Category:Presidents of the Osler Club of London ","title":"Alfred White Franklin"},{"id":"56699768","text":"Amiet is the surname of the following people: *Cuno Amiet (1868‚Äì1961), Swiss painter, illustrator, graphic artist and sculptor *William Amiet (1890‚Äì1959), Australian writer and barrister ","title":"Amiet"},{"id":"56699779","text":"David Farrar (born April 26, 1947) is a former American college basketball coach.

He taught and collaborated at several universities in West Africa, notably the universities of Benin City and Ilorin in Nigeria in 1978. Hired as an assistant professor in 1986 at the National University of Benin, he was then promoted several times within the Conseil africain et malgache de l'enseignement sup√©rieur (CAMES). Permanent interim secretary of the scientific council of the National University of Benin from 1994 to 1999, he was decorated as a knight of the national order of Benin in 1995 and became an officer of national order of Benin in 2008. Married with five children, reputed research professor, scientific director of Labo-Gbe, international laboratory of Gbe languages (Gadom√®, B√©nin), he has written seven books, thirteen book chapters and more than fifty articles in scientific reviews. He is a member of several learned societies including the Soci√©t√© Linguistique de l'Afrique de l'Ouest (SLAO) (Linguistic Society of West Africa) and the Institut International de Recherche et de Formation (INIREF) (International Institute of Research and Training) in Cotonou, Benin and an editor or assistant editor of several international scientific journals. He has guided several doctoral theses in Benin and elsewhere and contributed to the promotions of several colleagues in his department. Capo is the assistant director of the doctoral multidisciplinary school of the Faculty of Letters, Arts and Social Sciences of Aplahou√© in Kouffo Department in southwest Benin, an entity of the university of Abomey-Calavi. Hounkpati B Christophe Capo conducted research and taught in the linguistics departments and centers for african studies at several universities : University of Cologne (Germany), Cornell University (US), University of Gainesville (US), Ohio State University (US), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (US), Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Montr√©al (Canada), CASAS South Africa, University of Ghana (Lagon), University of Hamburg (Germany), University of Frankfurt (Germany), University of Bayreuth (Germany), University of Bremen (Germany). He has been associated with the development association of Com√© since 2002 and is a sitting councillor there as well. == Works == Hounkpati B Christophe Capo has worked on the rehabilitation of the languages of the Gbe dialectal continuum, previously known as the Aja-Eve languages of the Gulf of Benin in West Africa. Beginning in 1930, publications on the Gbe languages rapidly appeared, the vast majority on individual Gbe languages. Capo set out a classification of the Gbe languages and a reconstruction of the phonology of proto-Gbe. Much of the comparative research for this classification was carried out by Capo in the 1970s, and partial results were published in the 1970s and early 1980s as articles on specific phonological developments in various branches of the Gbe dialectal continuum, and notably as a standard spelling for Gbe languages. His first major work, Renaissance du Gbe (1988), published a classification of the Gbe languages for the first time. In 1991, he published Comparative phonology of Gbe. In this period, he also founded the Labo Gbe (Int.), the Laboratoire de recherche sur les langues Gbe (Research Laboratory on Gbe Languages) based in Benin, which promotes research and has published several articles and documents on Gbe languages. The Labo Gbe, in Gadom√® on the Cotonou-Lom√© road 40 km from Cotonou, has an impressive collection of documentation and a scientific journal titled Etudes Gbe ‚Äì Gbe Studies. == Publications == * 1982: Hounkpati B.C.

Notts Rangers did not play in a League until the 1889-1890 season. ==1888== Thomas Cooke made his Notts County and Football League debut at Trent Bridge, Nottingham on 8 December 1888. The opponents were high-flying Aston Villa, with only 1,500 in attendance. Cooke played at outside-right. The weather was terrible, heavy rainfall, and Notts County had prioritized a FA Cup tie so the League team was described as a ‚Äúscratch‚Äù side. Many County players were making their Club or League debuts and some, including Thomas Cooke, never played again after this match. However, one contemporary commentator stated that the new boys, including Thomas Cooke, did well. County goalkeeper Tom Widdowson could do nothing to stop the shot from Albert Brown that put Villa ahead. Widdowson had parried a powerful shot from Villa forward, Archie Hunter, but he couldn‚Äôt hold the ball which fell to Brown who scored. County played well after going behind and Thomas Cooke powered two shots goal-bound but both struck the goalpost. County got back into the game and scored a deserved equalizer by Bob Jardine. 1-1 at Half-Time. Villa forward Archie Goodall restored Villa‚Äô lead. Goodall latched onto a shot by fellow forward, Tommy Green and swept the ball past Widdowson. County rallied again after falling behind and scored a second equalizer by debut man Fred Weightman. County did have a chance to take the lead and Cooke was well placed to put County ahead. However, he shot wide. After Cooke‚Äô miss it was all Villa.

Hayes and Chad Hayes. It is a modern adaptation of the 1898 ghost story The Turn of the Screw by Henry James. The film stars Mackenzie Davis, Finn Wolfhard, Brooklynn Prince, and Joely Richardson, and follows a young governess in 1994 who is hired to watch over two children after their parents' deaths. The film first entered development in March 2016 and was described as a passion project for Steven Spielberg, who executive produced, wanting to be involved in a horror film again. The adaptation went through two phases of production: first as Haunted with Juan Carlos Fresnadillo attached as director, then as The Turning with Sigismondi. Filming took place at Killruddery House, County Wicklow, Ireland from February through April 2018. The Turning had its world premiere at Los Angeles Film Festival on January 23, 2020, and was theatrically released in the United States on January 24, 2020 by Universal Pictures. The critical consensus on Rotten Tomatoes calls it \\"stylish but muddled\\", and it received negative reviews on Metacritic. ==Plot== Miss Jessel, the live-in tutor at the Fairchild Estate, flees the house in a panic but is attacked by a ragged man. Sometime later, in 1994, Kate Mandell is leaving her job as a teacher to become a governess for the seven year old Flora Fairchild after Miss Jessel's disappearance. Before leaving, she visits her mother, Darla, who lives in a mental institution because she suffers from delusions. Upon arriving at the Fairchild Estate, Kate is informed by the caretaker Mrs. Grose that Flora witnessed her parents die in a car accident outside the house's gate and is a \\"special case.\\" Flora gives Kate a tour of the grounds and confesses that she is afraid Kate will leave her like Miss Jessel did but Kate promises not to. That night, Kate investigates a disturbance in the East Wing, which Flora refused to show her earlier. There, she encounters Flora's brother Miles, who is back from boarding school. The next day, Kate receives a call from the school's principal, who informs her that Miles is expelled after having been found strangling another boy. This startles Kate, who only becomes more aggravated with him when he and Flora begin pulling pranks on her. She lashes out at Miles, but later apologizes. Miles suggests he teach her how to ride horses to make it up to her, as their former riding instructor Quint has recently died. Kate notices strange occurrences happening at night, so she begins to keep her lights on when she goes to sleep. One day she suggests they go into town, to the dismay of both Flora and Mrs. Grose. Flora throws a fit and proceeds to run out of the car after Kate refuses to stop it. Miles warns her to leave but Kate decides to stay due to her promise to Flora. After reconciling, the group plays tag in the house. While looking for Miles, Kate is attacked by the ghost of Miss Jessel. She finds Miss Jessel's journal, which contains frightening entries about how Quint was obsessed with her and took pictures of her while she slept. When Kate inquires about it, Mrs. Grose tells her that Quint died a couple weeks following Miss Jessel's departure when he fell from his horse while riding drunk. Kate continues to see Quint and Miss Jessel's ghosts around the house, making her increasingly paranoid. Kate receives art from her mother in the mail, and Mrs. Grose comments that she hopes Kate's mother's condition isn't genetic. She is led by wet footprints and Miss Jessel's ghost to discover Miss Jessel's dead body in a pond on the house grounds. Kate also has a vision of Quint raping and strangling Miss Jessel and tells Mrs. Grose, who appears to have already known about it. Mrs. Grose assures her that she made sure Quint died. Quint's ghost pushes Mrs. Grose over the stair banister, killing her. Kate takes the children and they run from the house, managing to escape in her car. This previous sequence is then revealed to have been a vision which Kate had as she heard Mrs. Grose's words and looked at her mother's art. She walks in on the children talking about her and becomes convinced that she sees Quint's ghost in the mirror, insisting that Flora saw him too despite her protests. When Kate accidentally breaks Flora's doll, Miles smirks at her, calling her delusional. They then walk out of the room. In Kate's imagination, she walks into her mother's mental institution and approaches a figure that appears to be her mother; as the figure turns around, Kate screams in horror. The face of the figure is not revealed, and it is left open to interpretation as to whether Kate has seen her mother or is in fact seeing a reflection of herself. ==Cast== * Mackenzie Davis as Kate Mandell * Finn Wolfhard as Miles Fairchild * Brooklynn Prince as Flora Fairchild * Joely Richardson as Darla Mandell * Barbara Marten as Mrs. Grose * Mark Huberman as Bert * Niall Greig Fulton as Peter Quint * Denna Thomsen as Miss Jessel * Kim Adis as Rose * Karen Egan as Nancy * Darlene Garr as Holly ==Production== ===Development=== The film first entered development in March 2016 and was described as a passion project for Steven Spielberg, who executive produced, as he wanted to be involved in a horror film again. The film adaptation went through two phases of production: first as Haunted with Juan Carlos Fresnadillo attached as director, then the ultimate version, renamed as The Turning, with Floria Sigismondi. ====Fresnadillo project (2016)==== On March 9, 2016, Deadline Hollywood reported that Amblin Entertainment was hiring Juan Carlos Fresnadillo to direct a film titled Haunted, which would be inspired by Henry James' 1898 gothic ghost story, The Turn of the Screw. It would be scripted by Chad Hayes and Carey W. Hayes, with Roy Lee of Vertigo Entertainment, John Middleton and Scott Bernstein as producers. Haunted, which was to shoot under the DreamWorks label, would have been one of the first new projects to move forward since DreamWorks, Amblin and Participant Media formed the new Amblin Partners in late 2015, and after DreamWorks, which had been distributing its films through Disney's Touchstone Pictures since 2008, had struck a new distribution deal with Universal. On August 1, 2016, it was announced that Alfre Woodard had signed on to the project. Later that month, Rose Leslie joined as the lead. On September 21, 2016, five weeks before shooting was set to begin, Spielberg personally pulled the plug on the project because Scott Z. Burns' partial rewrite caused seismic changes in the story's fabric, altering characters, action, and even the title, and it no longer resembled the project the studio had signed on to make. Spielberg and DreamWorks decided the best course of action was to fire Fresnadillo and Burns, and resume using Hayes' original script, looking to start fresh development with a new director despite $5 million having been spent of the $17 million budget. ====Sigismondi project (2017 onward)==== On August 24, 2017, Deadline reported that Amblin Entertainment had set Floria Sigismondi to direct Haunted, now renamed as The Turning, which would feature a new draft by Jade Bartlett based on the original script by Chad and Carey W. Hayes. Production was expected to start in early 2018 with Scott Bernstein and Roy Lee still attached as producers, along with Seth William Meier. In October 2017, Mackenzie Davis signed on to portray the lead role of the nanny. In December 2017, it was announced that Finn Wolfhard had been cast as one of the orphans, and in January 2018, Brooklynn Prince was cast as the other. In February 2018, others actors were announced as principal production commenced. The casting of Joely Richardson was announced in January 2019. ====Filming==== Principal production began in Ireland on February 14, 2018, and filming began with the cast and crew behind strict security at Killruddery House in County Wicklow. Filming for Wolfhard and Prince concluded on March 27, 2018. Principal photography for the film completed on April 6, 2018. ==Music== The film's score is composed by Nathan Barr. Lawrence Rothman and their sister Yves helped \\"curate\\" the film's original soundtrack, which was deemed by Thrillist as better than the movie itself. The film's original soundtrack features tracks from Pale Waves, Mitski, girl in red, Kali Uchis, Vagabon, Courtney Love, Warpaint, Alice Glass, The Aubreys, Lawrence Rothman and Soccer Mommy, ==Release== The Turning was theatrically released on January 24, 2020, domestically and in select international territories. Universal Pictures had originally scheduled the film for February 22, 2019. In September 2018, the film was moved back, with DreamWorks Animation's How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World being slated in its place. ==Reception== ===Box office=== The Turning grossed $15.5 million in the United States and Canada, and $3.1 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $18.6 million. In the United States and Canada, the film was released alongside The Gentlemen, and was projected to gross $7‚Äì9 million from 3,000 theaters in its opening weekend. The film made $2.5 million on its first day, including $425,000 from Thursday night previews. It went on to debut to $7.3 million, finishing sixth at the box office. It then fell 56% to $3.1 million in its second weekend, finishing eighth. ===Critical response=== On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 11% based on 98 reviews, with an average rating of 3.58/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \\"Stylish but muddled, this misbegotten adaptation of Henry James' classic novel will send horror-hungry viewers Turning to the source material instead.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 35 out of 100, based on 24 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews.\\" Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare average grade of \\"F\\" on an A+ to F scale (one of only 19 films to receive the rating, ), while PostTrak reported an overall positive score of 34% (including an average 0 out of 5 stars), with 20% of people saying they would definitely recommend the film. Sadie Bell of Thrillist deemed the film's soundtrack to be better than the film itself. ==ReferencesCategory:American supernatural horror films Category:American films Category:British supernatural horror films Category:British films Category:Irish horror films Category:Films produced by Steven Spielberg Category:Films set in Maine Category:Films set in 1994 Category:Films shot in the Republic of Ireland Category:English-language films Category:2020 horror films Category:2020 films Category:2020s supernatural horror films Category:Amblin Entertainment films Category:DreamWorks Pictures films Category:Universal Pictures films Category:Films based on The Turn of the Screw Category:American ghost films Category:British ghost films Category:American haunted house films ","title":"The Turning (2020 film)"},{"id":"56700373","text":"Millionaires is a lostAmerican Silent Feature Film Survival Database: Millionaires 1926 American comedy film directed by Herman C.

McLaughlin was first elected to the City Council in November 1983, representing District 9 (Allston‚ÄìBrighton). He was subsequently re-elected five times, each term being for two years. His November 1987 victory was quite narrow; after finishing second in the preliminary election, McLaughlin won the general election by only 121 votes (4,627 to 4,506), with a recount later confirming his win. His November 1993 re-election also had to be confirmed by a recount. During his time on the council, McLaughlin was a strong advocate of rent control. In March 1995, McLaughlin announced that he would not seek re- election.

It has a single thin, hollow, onion-like leaf and up to sixty small green to greenish-yellow flowers. It grows in soil pockets on granite outcrops, especially where the soil receives run-off during rainy weather. == Description == Microtis graniticola is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single erect, smooth, tubular leaf long and wide. Between twenty and sixty green to yellowish-green flowers are crowded along a stiff, rigid flowering stem tall. The flowers lean downwards and are long, wide with an ovary long. The dorsal sepal is egg- shaped, long, about wide and hood-like. The lateral sepals are oblong, long, about wide with their tips rolled downwards. The petals are oblong, about long, wide and are enclosed by the dorsal sepal. The labellum is oblong, long, about wide and curves downwards with thickened, wavy edges and a notched tip. The callus in the centre of the labellum is variable in shape, but never comma-shaped as in the otherwise similar M. eremicola. Flowering occurs from September to November. ==Taxonomy and naming== Microtis graniticola was first formally described in 1996 by Robert Bates from a specimen collected on Wave Rock near Hyden and the description was published in Journal of the Adelaide Botanic Garden. The specific epithet (graniticola) is Latin for \\"granite dweller\\", referring to the habitat preference of this species. ==Distribution and habitat== Microtis graniticola grows in shallow soil pockets on large granite outcrops in arid areas between Balladonia and Mullewa. Its distribution includes parts of the Avon Wheatbelt, Coolgardie, Geraldton Sandplains, Mallee, Murchison and Yalgoo biogeographic regions. ==Conservation== Microtis eremaea is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. == References == == External links == * Category:Prasophyllinae graniticola Category:Endemic orchids of Australia Category:Orchids of Western Australia Category:Plants described in 1996 ","title":"Microtis graniticola"},{"id":"56700446","text":"The 1936 World Table Tennis Championships ‚Äì Men's Doubles was the tenth edition of the men's doubles championship.

It is situated at a height of and has to be climbed on foot to reach. It is notable for its dome and wall paintings dating back to the 5th century and its architecture. ==About== The church is one of the \\"35-odd rock-hewn churches, the largest concentration anywhere in Ethiopia.\\" It is situated in the erstwhile Gar'alta woreda. The entrance is reached by a steep and hazardous ascent with hand and footholds in the rock. Visitors have to cross a natural stone bridge with a sheer drop of approximately 250m on either side, and thereafter a final narrow wooden footbridge. A strenuous ascent is followed by a climb up a vertical rock wall depending entirely on hand grips and foot holds (without additional support) crowned with a walk over a 50 cm wide ledge facing a cliff of sheer drop. The standing pillars are made up of Enticho and Adigrat Sandstones, which are the last erosional remnants of a sandstone formation that once covered the Precambrian basement. ==History== According to local legend, the church was hewn in the sixth century and dedicated to Abuna Yemata (also referred to as Abba Yem'ata), one of the Nine Saints. The Nine Saints are traditionally believed to have originated from Rome, Constantinople and Syria between the end of the fifth and beginning of the sixth centuries. ==Paintings in the church== The paintings on the walls and domes of the church are preserved in a reasonable state. Extensive study was undertaken to understand the reason behind this phenomenon. The design of the traceries in the church replicates those found in nearby churches of Gher'alta, such as Debre Tsion church. There are more paintings depicting figures from the Old Testament than from the New Testament. The dry air and lack of humidity have preserved these frescoes in their original perfection. The paintings date back to initial traces of Christianity in Ethiopia and are themed around the nine saints and twelve apostles. The oldest icons are in the form of diptychs and triptychs dating back to the fifteenth century. ==See also== * Apostolic Vicariate of Abyssinia * Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church * Abuna ==Gallery== File:Wall_Painting_1_Abuna_Yemata_Guh.jpgWall painting File:Wall_painting_Abuna_Yemata_Guh.jpgWall painting 2 File:Wall_painting_3_Abuna_Yemata_Guh.jpgWall painting 3 File:Dome_painting_2_in_Abuna_Yemata_Guh.jpgDome painting File:Dome_painting_1_on_Abuna_Yemata_Guh_Church_roof.jpgDome painting 2 File:Panoramic_view_of_the_road_to_Abuna_Yemata_Guh.jpgPanoramic view File:Church_Bell_(wooden)_in_Abuna_Yemata_Guh.jpgChurch bell (wooden) File:Profile_view_of_the_Church_hill.jpgChurch view ==References== ==External links== Category:Monolithic churches in Ethiopia Category:Ethiopia articles by importance ","title":"Abuna Yemata Guh"},{"id":"56700672","text":"Henry Joe Sakala is a Zambian actor, writer, producer and director known for his leading role in a short film Guns and Rings and writer of the screenplay for the 2009 film, Reflection of Sadness.https://nofilmschool.com/u/henry-joe- sakala == Early life and education == Sakala attended Rokana Primary School in Kitwe from 1986 to 1992 and then proceeded to Libala Boys Secondary School from 1993 to 1997 in Lusaka where he completed his GCE Ordinary Levels.

Sampa's work focuses on working with people living with HIV and disabilities. She is a recipient of a Mandela Washington Fellowship, YALI participant and a PEPFAR beneficiary. After discovering her health status as being HIV positive, Sampa began to advocate for persons living with HIV/AIDS. == Early life and education == Sampa was born in Zambia, a country which has a generalized HIV epidemic. Her father died in 1994 when she was 2 years old and her mother died in 2002 when Sampa was only 10 years old. Sampa's uncle then became her guardian, and she moved to his house. Sampa took medication everyday without knowing why she was taking it or what it was for, or why her cousins living in the same house did not do the same, as the family did not discuss it. In 2002, she had stumbled upon her medical file that revealed life changing information stating that she was HIV positive, but did not ask any questions. Sampa attended Mary Queen of Peace for her primary education and later was enrolled in a boarding school for her secondary education. Whilst in boarding school, a peer discovered that Nsofwa was on ARV treatment. Soon the entire school was alerted, and Sampa found herself stigmatised, and sleeping alone as other students would not share a dormitory with her. She became very depressed, and she discarded her medication. Her health deteriorated drastically, and she had to leave school. She developed opportunistic infections including tuberculosis and meningitis, as a result of which she became blind and deaf in one ear. Her aunt had engaged an HIV/AIDS specialist, Mannasseh Phiri, to counsel Sampa, and it was from him that she learned that her mother had died due to HIV/AIDS related illness, and that she herself had contracted the virus at birth. After recovering, Sampa attended Munali High School, which offered education for the visually impaired, and learned braille at the Zambia Library for the Visually Impaired. She then studied clinical and psychosocial counselling at Chainama College of Health Sciences in 2013, so that she could work with people living with HIV and disabilities. == Career == Sampa is an HIV activist and clinical psychological counselor. She works with HIV-positive people to improve their status, live positively, and encourage families to discuss health issues with children. She assists those with HIV to follow treatment regimens. , Sampa is working on the Positive Movement project to empower people with disabilities, especially the blind. == Awards and honours == In 2014, she was a beneficiary of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief.

The trio now enters the next chapter of its being, and it seems the addition of Evans will be a step in the right direction for the group...

Established in 1957, it is the oldest medical school in Western Australia, with over 6000 alumni. Well-known for its research and clinical teaching, the medical school is ranked 8th in the world and 1st in Australia by the 2019 Academic Ranking of World Universities in clinical medicine. The medical school is affiliated with various teaching hospitals in Perth such as Royal Perth Hospital and Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital. The medical school is also heavily affiliated with the Queen Elizabeth II Medical Centre and its various research institutes. The school has prominent researchers and clinicians amongst its faculty and alumni, including Nobel Prize laureates Barry Marshall and Robin Warren (awarded for the discovery of the Helicobacter pylori bacterium); recipients of the Australian of the Year award Fiona Stanley and Fiona Wood; and cancer researcher Richard Pestell. The school has produced 11 Rhodes Scholars. ==History== The Fiona Stanley Hospital, one of the teaching hospitals of the medical school. Before 1957 and the establishment of the medical school, medical students spent a year at UWA before completing their degree at the University of Adelaide or another medical college. A first fundraising appeal for a new medical school was made in 1950, but enjoyed little success. However, due to the booming post-war population of the state, the second fundraising appeal in 1955 garnered significant financial support, and so the new medical school was formally established in 1957 with teaching commencing in the same year. The initial funding of the medical school largely came from the local government and the various communities of Western Australia. 1959 saw the first graduating medical students who were awarded Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) degrees. Buildings of the Queen Elizabeth II Medical Centre. Clinical teaching years are mainly done at the health campus situated there. In 1977, the Sir Charles Gairdner hospital was incorporated into the renamed Queen Elizabeth II Medical Centre. The Perth Medical Centre Act 1966 a few years before established the medical centre and provided the University of Western Australia membership of the trust that is responsible for the management of the land. Nowadays the medical school runs a variety of research collaborations with the medical centre. ==Campus== Most pre-clinical sciences are taught at the University's main campus. The UWA Health Campus, located at the Queen Elizabeth II Medical Centre, is responsible for most of the clinical teaching done during the course. Although large hospitals in the health campus such as Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital provide most of the clinical education for medical students, a significant number of students are also rotated through rural clinics associated with the university, such as the Rural Clinical School of Western Australia, an affiliated campus for rural clinical education. The various departments of the medical school are also located at the health campus, along with the medical and dental library of the university. The Oral Health Centre of WA and UWA Dental School are also located at the UWA Health Campus, situated next to the library. Because of its proximity, students are able to commute easily between the main campus and the health campus by bicycle. ==Curriculum== Prior to 2012, the primary medical qualification of MBBS was awarded to students who completed either the six year undergraduate degree program or the four year graduate-entry program. After 2012, the MBBS program was discontinued, replaced by the four year graduate-entry Doctor of Medicine degree. However, to ensure accessibility from high school, the medical school offers many Direct Assured Bachelor-MD pathway places to performing school-leavers, which can be completed in six years. Both the MBBS and MD degrees are recognized by the Australian Medical Council and the Singapore Medical Council for provisional registration. The first year of the medical course starts with foundational Science-based units including systems-based learning. Integrated medical practice begins in second year. The start of the second year has a clinical skills block followed by hospital placements. The third and fourth years continue with integrated medical practice, with various rotations and electives in fields including general practice, paediatrics, surgery, internal medicine, obstetrics and gynaecology, psychiatry and ophthalmology. The rotations are done in the major hospitals in the state. Since the state of Western Australia is the second largest country subdivision, a significant number of students also choose to train in the Rural Clinical School of Western Australia, where the standard curriculum and rotations are done in a rural setting. Teaching methods include tutorials, early clinical exposure, lectures, and problem-based learning. The Western Australian Medical Students' Society is the main society for medical students at the university, and represents the medical students' interests. It is responsible for some of the largest events at the campus and endeavours to involve students in medical networking, conferences, and other activities. The society was founded in 1946 for Western Australian medical students in Adelaide. Therefore the society predates the formation of the medical school itself. The society also issues awards and advice to current and past medical students. ==Research== Research is a large component of the Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences. The university has major research divisions in areas such as internal medicine, pharmacology, paediatrics, population health, psychiatry, surgery, neuroscience and pathology. Much of the research is supported by the Raine Medical Research Foundation, the largest bequest to the university for medical research and collaborations. The university is affiliated with the following centres and institutes: * Centre for Clinical Research in Neuropsychiatry * Centre for Genetic Origins of Health and Disease * Centre for Neonatal Research and Education * Centre for Musculoskeletal Studies * Oral Health Centre of Western Australia * Australian Neuromuscular Research Institute * Lions Eye Institute * Lung Institute of Western Australia * Telethon Kids Institute * Harry Perkins Institute of Medical Research The Queen Elizabeth II Medical Centre, viewed from Kings Park, Western Australia.

Terms were agreed with the Manor of Stepney in 1909 and the Council acquired strips on both north and south sides from Vallance Road east into Mile End Gate where gardens were laid out in 1909‚Äì10. Once regulated, trading west of Mile End Gate came to be called Whitechapel Market, though it is still regularly referred to as ‚Äòthe Waste‚Äô. It was noted in the 1970s for clothing, jewellery, flowers, second-hand records and hi-fi equipment. By the 1980s, when there were 124 pitches between Vallance Road and Cambridge Heath Road, the market was being transformed by a transition to Bangladeshi stallholders. They remain predominant, and there is still much clothing, as well as a range of foods hard to come by elsewhere. Whitechapel Market was the first market in the United Kingdom to recycle all the waste it generates in 2008. Tower Hamlets Council launched this special new service at a special event that was attended by television presenter, former borough resident and champion of the environment Oliver Heath. He helped the council mark the event by setting up a stall at the market to hand out information about recycling and re-usable shopping bags to passing market customers. A major operation was coordinated by the Metropolitan Police and the UK Border Agency (UKBA) in 2013 that led to 38 people being arrested or detained. Police also seized more than 500 mobile phones as they rifled through goods at 10 shops and stalls for which search warrants were issued. Members of Tower Hamlets Wheelers lobby group arrived at Whitechapel Market in 2014 to try to win over stall-holders who have objected to Tfl plans to upgrade a stretch of Whitechapel Road where six cyclists have been killed since 2011. The traders fear a segregated route would cut into the street market and block their deliveries. 30 campaigning cyclists arrived with baskets on their machines and filled up with shopping while trying to convince the traders about how upgrading the current CS2 route would be good for business. The group talked to stall-holders about their concerns and promised they would work with them to make sure the upgrade benefits all parties and were confident that more people will visit the market by bike if it‚Äôs made safe. In 2015, Elsayed Hosny, 64, was punished after he pleaded guilty to failing protect food from contamination at the unit in Brady Street and his business was closed for several weeks after environmental health officers discovered a mouse infestation at the premises. ==Whitechapel Market Conservation Area== The Whitechapel Market Conservation Area was designated in June 1997 and extended in October 2008. The Conservation Area is named after the market and lies between Cambridge Heath Road to the East London Mosque and Davenant Centre to the West, Whitechapel Road to the south and Durward Street to the north. Many of the buildings fronting Whitechapel Road Market are of architectural and historical importance, and Whitechapel Road itself is an important and historically significant movement route within East London. ==Trade== The market has developed into a prosperous social and economic that sells a huge array of commodities 6 days a week (Monday to Sunday). Visitors can buy there fresh and exotic fruits and vegetables, different kind of spices, fashion such as cultural wear, bags, scarves and jewellery. ==Management== The market is publicly managed and owned by the London Borough of Tower Hamlets Market Service, the market regulatory service based in Commercial Street, Spitalfields who promotes, licences, develop and support to traders. They also take the approach to market management as an investment in the future, not just solely a regulatory function. ==References== Category:Retail markets in London Category:Whitechapel ","title":"Whitechapel Road market"},{"id":"56701067","text":"Ballynacarrow, locally Ballinacarrow (), is a village in County Sligo, Ireland.

M√ºller was a member of the supervisory board of Borussia Dortmund. He was instrumental in the successful application of the Ruhr as European Capital of Culture in 2010, uniting the region. M√ºller was married; he and his wife Marion had two children. In April 2018, he received the Order of Merit of North Rhine-Westphalia for his life's achievements (f√ºr sein Lebenswerk) in the presence of Gerhard Schr√∂der. He resigned from all offices in May 2018, due to his cancer illness. He died in Essen on 15 July 2019. == Legacy == In his laudatio for M√ºller in 2009, awarding the Great Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany, President Horst K√∂hler focused on M√ºller's ability to speak the language of both politics and economy, and enable dialogue between them. In the matter of nuclear power phase-out, he managed to represent the voters' wishes even though they were not his own view, and he always held constructive discussions with people representing different positions and interests. K√∂hler mentioned M√ºller's competence, calm manner, equanimity and dependability. In turning away from coal mining, he created a model of a socially responsible structural transition, with patience and tenacity. After his death, Schr√∂der acknowledged M√ºller as a great economic leader who knew the rules of the game of both business and politics, which enabled him to turn opponents to partners. Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, noted M√ºller's enormous expertise, dry humour and calm manner, achieving invaluable benefits for the German miners.

He was educated at Bury St Edmunds Grammar School, and was admitted at St John's College, Cambridge on 18 May 1697, aged17. By a marriage settlement dated 10 September 1706, he married with ¬£4,500, Elizabeth Windham, daughter of William Windham of Felbrigg, Norfolk. His marriage brought him into connection with many Norfolk Whig families, although his father was a Tory. ==Career== de Grey was returned as Whig Member of Parliament for Thetford at the 1708 British general election. He supported the naturalization of the Palatines in 1709, and voted for the impeachment of Dr Sacheverell in 1710. He did not stand at the 1710 British general election, possibly on grounds of cost, and at the 1713 British general election, declined an invitation by Robert Walpole to stand for Norfolk. At the 1715 British general election, de Grey was backed by Lord Townshend as a Whig candidate for Norfolk and he won the contest. He voted against the septennial bill of 1716 and joined the opposition (led by Townshend and Robert Walpole) against Lord Cadogan in June 1717. He abstained from the votes on the Peerage Bill and on repealing the Occasional Conformity Act and Schism Act, all in 1719. He did not want to stand again at the 1722 British general election, writing to Townshend asking: Townshend did not let him stand down and he won the seat unopposed, but never stood again. ==Death and legacy== de Grey died in 1765 and was buried at Merton on 18 December 1765.

She was professor of microbiology at the National University of Ireland, Galway, a member of the Royal Irish Academy, one of Mary Robinson's nominees on the Council of State, and chairwoman of An Taisce - the National Trust for Ireland. == Birth and education == Colleran, and her twin Noreen, were born in Ballinrobe, Co Mayo in October 1945 to John and Josie Colleran. One of a family of five children, her father was a school principal and her mother, also a primary school teacher, died when she was just 11 years old. She completed her secondary education at St Louis secondary school in Kiltimagh. She spent a lot of time outdoors as a child, particularly fishing, which sparked her interest in the environment. On entering higher education, she had a grant from the Department of Education, which required that she had to do her studies through the Irish language. Her first choice, Medicine, was not available through Irish so she chose Science. She graduated with a first class primary degree in Science at University College Galway (now National University of Ireland, Galway) in 1967. She specialised in anaerobic digestion as a postgraduate and in 1971 became a postdoctoral fellow for two years at the University of Bristol in the UK. == Academic career == Colleran lectured in biology at Athlone Regional Technical College (now AIT) and Galway Regional Technical College (now GMIT) before her appointment as a lecturer in microbiology at NUIG in 1976. She was appointed Associate Professor of microbiology by the Senate of the National University of Ireland in 1990. She was a member of the university's governing authority for a number of years, but stepped down in May 2000 in connection with the selection procedure for the new university president. In October that year she was appointed professor of microbiology and chair of the department at NUIG. She was the first director of the Environment Change Institute at NUIG set up under the Higher Education Authority's Programme for Research in Third Level Institutions in 2000. == Environmentalist == In 1973 Colleran was elected to the committee of the Galway Association of An Taisce, part of a national voluntary organisation the aims of which were to conservation in Ireland through education, publicity and positive action. She served as membership secretary and then treasurer to the Galway branch before becoming chairman. In 1981, as chairman of the Galway branch, she hit back at claims from Galway County Council that An Taisce were an anonymous group, wielding power unfairly. She was involved in the compilation of a controversial planning report, published by An Taisce in 1983, which highlighted abuse of planning laws by city and county councillors across Ireland, and in particular in counties Galway, Mayo, Donegal, Kerry and Louth. She served as Environmental Officer for An Taisce before being elected National Chairman in 1987, the first time a chairman had come from one of the western county associations. She continued to use her position to campaign against misuse of planning laws, for a clamp down on pollution of rivers and lakes, and against a move to scrap An Foras Forbartha, a body that provided independent monitoring of pollution. During her three years as chairman, until May 1990, she was particularly involved in debates over local environmental and planning issues, in particular over gold mining in the west of Ireland, a proposed airport for Clifden, and the planned sewage treatment plant at Mutton Island in Galway. In 1991 plans were announced for a new visitor centre, to be located at Mullaghmore in The Burren. Colleran was among those who were part of an appeal, saying that while the plan for the national park was welcomed by An Taisce, they wanted the visitor centre to be located three or four miles from Mullaghmore. == Appointments and honours == President Mary Robinson appointed seven new members to her Council of State in February 1991, including Colleran. Other new members appointed at the time were Monica Barnes, Patricia O'Donovan, Quintan Oliver, Rosemarie Smith, D√≥nal Toolan and D. Kenneth Whitaker. The new Council of State represented a wide spectrum of Irish life and was widely welcomed, although Fine Gael was disappointed that its leader John Bruton was not included. In 1991, she was one of 15 people appointed to Taoiseach Charles Haughey's Green 2000 Advisory Group, to determine which problems would face the environment in the next century. The group was led by Dr David Cabot, special advisor on environmental affairs. She was appointed a member of the National Heritage Council in 1995 by the then Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Michael D. Higgins. In the same year the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, Eamon Gilmore, appointed her to the chair of the Sea Trout working group to oversee the implementation of recommendations to tackle a decline in sea trout stocks, particularly in the west of Ireland. In 2003 Colleran was elected as member of the Royal Irish Academy. She was recognised at the annual NUI Galway Alumni Awards in 2004 when she received the award for Natural Science, sponsored by Seavite Bodycare Ltd., which acknowledges a graduate who has made an outstanding contribution in the field of natural science. == Later life and death == Colleran died on 30 June 2018 at University Hospital Galway. ==References== Category:1945 births Category:2018 deaths Category:People from County Mayo Category:Irish microbiologists Category:Irish scholars and academics Category:Alumni of NUI Galway Category:Presidential appointees to the Council of State (Ireland) ","title":"Emer Colleran"},{"id":"56701327","text":"The Wapous River is a tributary of the Gouin Reservoir, flowing in the territory of the town of La Tuque, in the administrative region of Mauricie, in Quebec, in Canada.

It stood at the intersection of 6th Street SW and B Street SW (now Independence Avenue) between the Smithsonian Castle and the Capitol. The 12 wards extended across the Mall, all the way to the Canal. Today, the National Air and Space Museum stands in its place. ==History== ===The Armory=== View of the Mall in 1863 with the Armory and the Wards along with the Smithsonian Castle and the Canal. On March 11, 1856, President Franklin Pierce sent a message to the Senate Committee on Military Affairs with information regarding a suitable location for an Armory for \\"the preservation of ordnance, arms, etc., in Washington\\". The report was passed from the Ordnance Officer to Secretary of War Jefferson Davis and then to the President. Five sites were analysed and the second one was recommended.Index of the Executive Documents Printed by Order of the Senate of the United States, First and Second Sessions Thirty- Fourth Congress, 1855‚Äì1856, page 10 The next site examined was at the intersection of B street south and Sixth street west, north of the former street and west of the latter. Situated at a nearly central point, the ground was \\"level and firm enough for building on\\" with easy access from other parts of the city and \\"ample space on the government reservation contiguous to the site not only for future extension of the building, but for military parade grounds, with little hazard of these two advantages of space being trenched upon by other improvements. Based on these recommendations, the Armory was built that same year next to the canal. ===The Hospital=== View of the eastern side of the Mall in 1879. The Armory is the first square building on the right. Following the American Civil War's 1861 beginning, President Abraham Lincoln asked Doctor Willard Bliss to organize a system of hospitals in and around the city of Washington, D.C.The Lady Nurse of Ward E ‚Äì Amanda Akin Stearns Among the facilities which resulted from this directive were several facilities which were built in or near Washington, D.C., including the Armory Square Hospital, which was built on the land surrounding the city's Armory in 1862. It offered 1,000 beds in twelve wards (barracks) and overflow tents to treat the wounded from the battlefields of Virginia. Wounded soldiers were brought across the Potomac River to the city wharves in southwest Washington, D.C., including the Fish Wharf as well as on the Long Bridge which landed at the other end of Maryland Avenue SW a few blocks away. In addition to these barracks, quarters for officers, service facilities and a chapel were built on site.Historic Medical Sites in the Washington, DC Area ‚Äì NIH ‚Äì U.S. National Library of Medicine ‚Äì https://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/medtour/armory.html The closest to the arrival points for the steamboats of all of the Washington, D.C.-based Union Army hospitals, it became the treatment facility where the gravely wounded remained, receiving end-of-life care if terminally ill or undergoing additional surgeries or other types of treatment until well enough to be shipped home or moved to a hospital farther away from the war. Volunteers from the northern States came to provide assistance in the hospitals including the Armory as nurses as well as support staff. Dr. Bliss became the superintendent for the hospital and remained to practice in the city after the war.Whitman, Walt; Miller, Edwin Haviland (2007). The Correspondence: Volume I: 1842‚Äì1867. New York, NY: New York University Press. p. 91. . Among those volunteers was poet Walt Whitman, who had made his way from New York to Washington, D.C., after reading that his brother might have been wounded. After finding his brother and learning that he had sustained only a minor injury, Whitman realized the depth of suffering that other less fortunate soldiers were enduring, and began volunteering as part of the Christian Commission in the city hospitals, visiting wounded soldiers and developing close relationships with many of them and raising money for provisions for them. This experience would have a profound influence on him and his later writings.Revising Himself: Walt Whitman and Leaves of Grass ‚Äì Wound Dresser ‚Äì Library of Congress ‚Äì https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/whitman/wounddresser.html In The Wound Dresser, he wrote: > I devote myself much to Armory-square hospital because it contains by far > the worst cases, most repulsive wounds, has the most suffering and most need > of consolation.

Hospital chaplains also worked to ease the suffering of wounded soldiers, dispensing books and other reading materials, as well as words of comfort and advice. The first issue of the Armory Square Hospital Gazette was published on January 6, 1864. In an article entitle Salutatory, the publisher wrote: \\"the Hospital is an episode in soldier's life‚Äîsometimes a painful termination of it, which has many an event worthy of a chronicle.

The last issue was published on the 21 August 1865. With hostilities ended following the Surrender at Appomattox on April 9, 1865, and the resulting decline in the number of patients being sent to Union Army hospitals, military leaders determined that the Armory hospital was no longer needed and was closed during the summer of 1865. The last edition of the hospital newspaper, which was published on 21 August 1865, offered the following reflection: > During the last three years, thousands of our brave soldiers have been > inmates of Armory Square [...] One cannot conceive of a gun-shot wound that > has not been treated here.

He came from a lower-class family. His father Pyotr Iossiffovich (–ü—ë—Ç—Ä –ò–æ—Å–∏—Ñ–æ–≤–∏—á) was a bricklayer and mother Anna Ivanovna a housewife. At the age of 9 Grigory started attending parish school at Zvenigorod church, which he enjoyed immensely. Education was interrupted by his family's disastrous financial situation. After which he started working in a local blacksmith shop. In the spring of 1909 family sold their house in Zvenigorodka and moved to a nearby small town of Uman. At the age of 16 Grigory moved out of parent's house and became a bricklayer. He joined a local social democratic club in Uman in 1913. Soon he was deported from Kiev province and moved to Kazan. === Joining the Bolsheviks === In January 1915 he was drafted into the army, but due to congenital diseases was only fit for wartime militia units and not for regular service. Early in 1916 Grigory moved to Tavatui near Yekaterinburg and started working at the construction site of the dynamite plant (–¢–∞–≤–∞—Ç—É–π—Å–∫–∏–π –¥–∏–Ω–∞–º–∏—Ç–Ω—ã–π –∑–∞–≤–æ–¥). Very soon after moving he was drawn to local Bolsheviks and met Mikhail Kabanov who helped him become a devoted follower of Lenin. By the end of 1916 he was organizing a strike at the dynamite plant. In March 1917 Nikulin became a member of the Bolshevik faction of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP). The number of his party membership was 128185. As a result of financing problems with French joint-stock company, plant activists decided to stop all work with the construction of this facility early in 1918. Nikulin was sent to Yekaterinburg along with all the party members of the factory. He met Goloschekin, a member of the Ural Regional Committee of the RSDLP and joined the Ural Cheka on his recommendation. Starting his service in Cheka, Nikulin soon became acquainted with Yakov Yurovsky who noticed Nikulin's modesty, ability to get along with different people, honesty and absolute sobriety. The two became friends and formed a special relationship that lasted for years where Yurovsky simply called him \\"son\\". Nikulin was appointed Assistant to the Commandant of the House of Special Purpose on the recommendation of Yurovsky. The Commandant was Yurovsky himself. == Yekaterinburg Cheka == Having begun work in the Cheka, Grigory was assigned some serious cases. One of the first was discrete surveillance of Alexander Ivanovich Andogsky, the head of the Military Academy of Workers' and Peasants' Red Army. Nikulin was introduced as a domestic worker to Andogsky after the Academy was evacuated from Petrograd to Yekaterinburg in March 1918. Later the same year Andogsky joined the White forces, was dismissed from the Military Academy and eventually was appointed as General in Kolchak's Army. Nikulin was also in charge of soldier selection for train convoy L-42, on 30 April 1918 where Tsar Nicholas II and part of his family were moved from Tyumen to Yekaterinburg. === Killing of Prince Dolgorukov === Execution of Prince Vasily Alexandrovich Dolgorukov. Dolgorukov was a close friend of Nicholas II as well as his adviser, Marshal of the Imperial Court (1914‚Äì1917) and Commander of the Imperial Guard cavalry regiment. Deeply devoted to the Tsar he voluntarily accompanied the Imperial family to imprisonment in Tobolsk. After arriving in Yekaterinburg at the end of May he was separated from the family and arrested. Dolgorukov was executed 10 July 1918 in cold blood by Nikulin, a week before the killing of Tsar Nicholas II and his family. Dolgorukov was taken to a field beyond the city's Ivanovskoe Cemetery with Count Tatishchev and the two were shot in the head and thrown into a pit. Nikulin recalled the incident in his radio interview 1964: \\"–Ø –≤—ã–≤–µ–∑ –µ–≥–æ –≤ –ø–æ–ª–µ –∏ –ø—Ä–æ–∫–ª—è–ª –≤—Å—ë –ø–æ–∫–∞ —Ç–∞—â–∏–ª —á–µ–º–æ–¥–∞–Ω—ã –Ω–∞–∑–∞–¥\\" (I took him out to the field and cursed everything while I was dragging his suitcases back). Dolgorukov was canonized by the Russian Orthodox Church in 1981. Nikulin was also involved in death of Hermogenes, Bishop of Tobolsk and Siberia, who was drowned in the Tura River by the Bolsheviks. === Killing of Nicholas II and family === Grigory Nikulin is known for his participating in the killing of Tsar Nicholas II and his family. Nikulin was living in the House of Special Purpose Ipatiev House since his appointment as Assistant to the Commandant. He was also in charge of the house in absence of Yurovsky who lived in the \\"American Hotel\\". The Ural Regional Soviet agreed in a meeting on June 29 that the Romanov family should be executed. After getting the final approval from the Central Executive Committee in Moscow Yurovsky organized a meeting in American Hotel. Participation in the killing was voluntary and people who agreed to participate came to Yurovsky's room. It was agreed that to prevent unnecessary suffering that the condemned were to be shot in the heart. On 17 July, right after midnight Yurovsky woke up the Tsar, his family, doctor and servants, 11 persons altogether and guided them to an empty room in the lower floor of the house. On demand of Tsaritsa Alexandra Nikulin brought two chairs. One for her and one for Prince Alexei. Yurovsky announced the verdict: \\"Nikolai Alexandrovich, in view of the fact that your relatives are continuing their attack on Soviet Russia, the Ural Executive Committee has decided to execute you.\\" Shooting started. It is controversial who actually shot the Tsar ‚Äì Yurovsky, Medvedev, Ermakov, or all of them. Nikulin shot one bullet to Prince Alexei and left the room. Apparently Alexei didn't die from this shot. Yurovsky shot Alexei in the head killing him. Long after this event, in private conversation with the son of Mikhail Medvedev, Nikulin said that he couldn't bear having the sick boy looking at him and stopped shooting. Afterwards Nikulin oversaw the carrying of the corpses to a truck waiting outside. He had all the jewels and valuables that had been sewn into the clothes of the royal family removed. On 20 July, just a few days before the arrival of the White Army, Nikulin left Yekaterinburg. He personally carried 6,000 carats of the Tsar's diamonds to the State Bank in Moscow. Nikulin initially left a good impression on the Imperial family during visits to the Ipatiev House with Yurovsky. He wasn't like the others. He was well-mannered and polite. From the diary of Alexandra Feodorovna: \\"June 21st, Thursday. \\"..young assistant, who seems very nice person, compared to other ones that are vulgar and unpleasant.. Young man (Nikulin) enumerated jewelry items and did it thoroughly\\". From the diary of Nicholas II: \\"June 23th, Saturday. Yurovsky and his assistant (Nikulin) started to understand what sort of people was around, stealing from us and guarded us from them\\". However, after Yurovsky became commandant of the Ipatiev House on 4 July and continuously tightened restrictions imposed on the Romanov family, Nicholas wrote in his diary on 11 July, \\"We like this man less and less.\\"Rappaport, pp. 118‚Äì119. == After Yekaterinburg == After completing the assignment in Yekaterinburg, Nikulin joined the Red Army. He had several duties at 3rd Army of the Eastern front. He even took part in battles. Early 1919 he started working for political department of the division (politotdel) but contracted typhus and was taken to Moscow. There he met again Yurovsky, who worked for Moscow City Council at the time and offered him a job as head of the Moscow apartment houses. They continued their warm friendship meeting each other on and off duty. Nikulin stayed in Moscow and worked in different jobs. First for City Council (MosSoviet). Later he was allocated to the position of Moscow prisons head. Four months after that the head of inspectorate department of Moscow police. He then worked as the head of Moscow Criminal Investigation Department from March 1920 to 1922. In 1922 he was awarded with the Order of the Red Banner. == Later life == Between 1923 and 1938 Nikulin held several noteworthy positions. From 1923 to 1924 he was Vice-head of the Moscow Criminal Investigation Department. In 1925 he was a member of MosGorIspolCom (Moscow Executive Committee). From 1925 to 1930 he was the head of MosGubStrakh (Moscow Insurance State Company). From 1930 to 1931 he was the head of MosGas (Moscow Gas trest). From 1933 to 1935 he worked at MosSovet on a problem concerning building materials manufacturing, and from 1935 to 1938 he was the head of MosZhilOtdel (Moscow Housing Department). He was often visited by comrades such as Rodzinsky and Medvedev. In 1927 Nikulin and Yurovsky made an application to the USSR Revolution Museum and handed them two revolvers which were used in the killing of Imperial Family. Yurovsky died in 1938. Before dying he wrote a warm farewell letter to his dear friend Nikulin leaving him a list of documents to be delivered to the Revolution Museum. From 1938 to his retirement in 1960 Nikulin worked for Department of Water and Sewerage. He was awarded with four state orders, one of which was Order of the Patriotic War 1st class (1947). During his whole life Nikulin insisted on keeping low profile concerning the killing of imperial family. He even asked Medvedev not to mention his role in the execution. One year before his death he was asked by a high party official to give an interview on radio. It resulted in a 3 hour recording in which he talks about everything. \\"All was done consciously, without doubts. I did understand all responsibility. I welcomed the decision of Ural Regional Soviet.. And even more, if it is allowed to say, I considered it as an honor.\\" Grigory Nikulin died on 22 September 1965. He was buried on the site of the \\"Old Bolsheviks\\" at Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow. Across from Nikulin's grave is the grave of Boris Yeltsin, President of the Russian Federation. Ipatiev House was demolished by order of Boris Yeltsin in 1977 while he was leader of the Sverdlovsk Executive Committee. The Politburo had declared the house not to be of \\"sufficient historical significance\\". == References == # https://i-podmoskovie.ru/php/podmoskovnii- letopisets/articles/2355-tsareubijtsa.html (–í–∞—Å–∏–ª–∏–π –í–∞—Å–∏–ª—å–µ–≤–∏—á –ü–∞–Ω—á–µ–Ω–∫–æ–≤. 11.03.2015. –¶–∞—Ä–µ—É–±–∏–π—Ü–∞) # –ó–∞–ø–∏—Å—å –±–µ—Å–µ–¥—ã —Å –ì.–ü. –ù–∏–∫—É–ª–∏–Ω—ã–º –æ —Ä–∞—Å—Å—Ç—Ä–µ–ª–µ —Ü–∞—Ä—Å–∫–æ–π —Å–µ–º—å–∏, —Å–¥–µ–ª–∞–Ω–Ω–∞—è –≤ –†–∞–¥–∏–æ–∫–æ–º–∏—Ç–µ—Ç–µ –ø–æ —Ä–∞—Å–ø–æ—Ä—è–∂–µ–Ω–∏—é –¶–ö –ö–ü–°–° –≤ 1964 –≥–æ–¥—É - –†–ì–ê–°–ü–ò. –§. 588. –û–ø. 3—Å. –î. 13. –õ. 1-71 http://statearchive.ru/assets/images/docs/n10/ # –ó–∞–ø–∏—Å–∫–∞ –∫–æ–º–µ–Ω–¥–∞–Ω—Ç–∞ –¥–æ–º–∞ –ò–ø–∞—Ç—å–µ–≤–∞ –Ø.–ú. –Æ—Ä–æ–≤—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –æ —Ä–∞—Å—Å—Ç—Ä–µ–ª–µ —Ü–∞—Ä—Å–∫–æ–π —Å–µ–º—å–∏ –∏ –æ –ø–æ–ø—ã—Ç–∫–∞—Ö —Å–ø—Ä—è—Ç–∞—Ç—å —Ç—Ä—É–ø—ã (—Å –ø–æ–º–µ—Ç–∞–º–∏, —Å–¥–µ–ª–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–º–∏ –ú.–ù. –ü–æ–∫—Ä–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–º) - –ì–ê –†–§. –§. 601. –û–ø. 2. –î. 27. –õ. 31-34 http://statearchive.ru/assets/images/docs/232/ # –£–±–∏–π—Å—Ç–≤–æ —Ü–∞—Ä—Å–∫–æ–π —Å–µ–º—å–∏/–ù–∏–∫–æ–ª–∞–π –°–æ–∫–æ–ª–æ–≤. - –ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–∞: –ê–ª–≥–æ—Ä–∏—Ç–º, 2016. - 384—Å. - (–†–æ–º–∞–Ω–æ–≤—ã. –¢–∞–π–Ω—ã –¥–∏–Ω–∞—Å—Ç–∏–∏). # –ò–ø–∞—Ç—å–µ–≤—Å–∫–∞—è –Ω–æ—á—å/–≠.–°. –†–∞–¥–∑–∏–Ω—Å–∫–∏–π. - –ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–∞: –ê–°–¢, 2007. - 272—Å. - (–ó–æ–ª–æ—Ç–∞—è –∫–æ–ª–ª–µ–∫—Ü–∏—è –ê–ò–§). # –í–æ–ø—Ä–æ—Å–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–µ –∑–Ω–∞–∫–∏ –≤ \\"–¶–∞—Ä—Å–∫–æ–º –¥–µ–ª–µ\\"/ –Æ—Ä–∏–π –ñ—É–∫. - –°–ü–±.: –ë–•–í-–ü–µ—Ç–µ—Ä–±—É—Ä–≥, 2013. - 640—Å. - (–û–∫–Ω–æ –≤ –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—é) # –ü—Ä–∏–∫–∞–∑ ‚Ññ 3 –∫–æ–º–µ–Ω–¥–∞–Ω—Ç–∞ –î–æ–º–∞ –æ—Å–æ–±–æ–≥–æ –Ω–∞–∑–Ω–∞—á–µ–Ω–∏—è –Ø.–ú. –Æ—Ä–æ–≤—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –æ –Ω–∞–∑–Ω–∞—á–µ–Ω–∏–∏ –ø–æ–º–æ—â–Ω–∏–∫–æ–º –∫–æ–º–µ–Ω–¥–∞–Ω—Ç–∞ –ù–∏–∫—É–ª–∏–Ω–∞, –Ω–∞—á–∞–ª—å–Ω–∏–∫–æ–º –∫–æ–º–∞–Ω–¥—ã –≤—Å–µ–π –Ω–∞—Ä—É–∂–Ω–æ–π –æ—Ö—Ä–∞–Ω—ã –Ø–∫–∏–º–æ–≤–∞, –µ–≥–æ –ø–æ–º–æ—â–Ω–∏–∫–∞–º–∏ –ú–µ–¥–≤–µ–¥–µ–≤–∞ –∏ –°–∞—Ñ–æ–Ω–æ–≤–∞ - –ì–ê –†–§. –§. 601. –û–ø.2. –î.34. –õ. 34 http://statearchive.ru/assets/images/docs/123/ # –ì—Ä–∏–≥–æ—Ä–∏–π –ù–∏–∫—É–ª–∏–Ω. –ù–∞—á–∞–ª—å–Ω–∏–∫ –ú–£–†–∞ –≤ 1920-1921–≥–≥. // –ü–µ—Ç—Ä–æ–≤–∫–∞, 38.- ‚Ññ 14 (9615) –æ—Ç 24.04.2018 - http://petrovka-38.com/arkhiv/item/grigorij-nikulin-nachalnik- mura-v-1920-1921-gg * Rappaport, Helen.

His name occurs in financial documents from the 1620s and in Chuvash legends.. The Chuvash feudal system that existed in the Khanate of Kazan was abandoned soon after the Chuvash country was annexed by Russia. A great part of Chuvash aristocracy was killed during the invasion of the Khanate of Kazan by the Muscovites (1545 ‚Äì 1552) and subsequent uprisings (1552 ‚Äì 1585). The survivors became vassals of the Russian Tsar and in a short time lost their status as noblemen, their real properties being awarded to Russian landlords and monasteries. In the 17th century, there still existed a number of Chuvash noblemen of low and middle rank, i.e. sergeants vunp√º, lieutenants ≈õƒïrp√º and tarkhans turxan who were equated by the authorities to Russian servicemen. The only high-rank Chuvash nobleman that is mentioned in the contemporary Russian sources is the ‚Äúknyaz Temey Tenyakov‚Äù. In Chuvash system, he held the title p√º, corresponding to Common Turkic beg or bey. According to Russian documents, on 12 May 1625, the Chuvash knyaz Temey Tenyakov and his companions were granted fields along the Little Autla River (now in Jƒïpre≈õ district of Chuvashia) by the voivode of ≈†upa≈°kar Nikita Likharev. At that time, Tenyakov served as a lieutenant in the ≈†erdan volost of the ≈†upa≈°kar uyezd. His residence was located in the village of MƒÉn P√ºkassi (‚ÄúPrince's big village‚Äù in Chuvash). The location of Tenyakov's residence in MƒÉn P√ºkassi is further confirmed by Chuvash legends. In a legend recorded in 1969 in the village of Naƒçar ƒåemur≈°a, Ten√§k Temejƒï is described as a cruel landlord who dispossessed Chuvash peasants of their lands. To escape from his atrocities, all Tatar and almost all Chuvash inhabitants of Naƒçar ƒåemur≈°a left the village. In his book ‚ÄúThe ancient Chuvashes‚Äù, the novelist Juxma Mi≈°≈°i depicts Ten√§k Temejƒï as a betrayer of the Chuvash people who assisted the Russian authorities whilst most of his bannermen supported anti-Muscovite resistance movement. However, after a while he repented and joined the Chuvash rebels. He raised an army and took the fortress of ≈öƒïrp√º. Then he marched his army to the town of Sƒïve but was captured by the Russians.

He attended Westminster School and Trinity College, Cambridge. On 14 January 1789 he married Hester Browne, by whom he had three sons and six daughters. His father Edward was MP for Norfolk for twenty-two years and gave it up in 1790 rather than contest it. Jacob was given a commission as a captain in the East Norfolk Militia in 1780, which he held until 1794, when he was made lieutenant colonel in the Norfolk Fencible Cavalry, a role he held for five years. He was on military service in Scotland in 1797 when his mother announced his candidature for one of the seats in his father's old constituency, which had fallen vacant when Sir John Wodehouse was made a peer. The constituency's other MP Thomas William Coke offered him financial help and Astley was returned unopposed, despite Wodehouse threatening to refuse his peerage and remain MP to block his election. Astley professed neutrality and publicly distanced himself from Coke, but he did vote with the Whigs against William Pitt the Younger's assessed taxes and land tax redemption in late 1797 and early 1798, against the refusal to enter into peace negotiations with France in 1800 and for the censure motion by Grey on 25 March 1801. By his father's death in 1802 both his elder brothers had died and so he inherited the baronetcy and Melton Constable Hall in Norfolk. Again assisted by Coke, his re-election campaign of 1802 was fierce and he was attacked as \\"a liar, a coward, an assassin, a scoundrel, a murderer; and ...[the murderer of] his own father\\". He initiated a libel case, though the defence cited his own father's words just before his death and Astley was only awarded a fifth of the ¬£10,000 damages he claimed. When his mother's brother Edward Hussey Delaval died in 1814 he inherited his estate of Seaton Delaval Hall in Northumberland.

Microvalves are basic components in microfluidic devices, such as Labs-on-a-chip, where they are used to control the fluidic transport. During the period 1995-2005, a lot of Microelectromechanical systems-based microvalves were developed. Microvalves found today can be roughly categorized as active microvalves and passive microvalves. Based on the medium they control, microvalves can be divided into gas microvalves and liquid microvalves. Based on their initial mode, microvalves can be divided into normally open, normally closed and bistable microvalves. == Types of microvalves == === Active microvalves === right Active mechanical microvalves consist of mechanically movable membrane or boss structure, coupled to an actuation method, that can close of an orifice, thus blocking the flow path between the inlet and outlet ports. The actuator can either be an integrated magnetic, electrostatic, piezoelectric or thermal microactuator, a \\"smart\\" phase change, e.g. Shape-memory alloy, or rheological material, or an externally applied actuation mechanism, such as an external magnetic field or pneumatic source. === Passive microvalves === right Passive microvalves are valves for which the operational state, i.e. open or close, is determined by the fluid they control. Most common passive microvalves are flap valves, membrane microvalves and ball microvalves. == Microvalve applications == === Gas Microvalves === Controlling a gas flow with MEMS microvalves has the following general benefits: the integration of the actuation mechanism with the other microvalve components allows component miniaturization; and the small scale of the component results in a rapid response time and a low-power consumption. However, despite the potential for cost-efficient batch fabrication offered by microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technologies, gas microvalves have so far failed to reach the critical cost-per-performance ratio needed for a wide adoption of this technology. === Check valves === Most check valves, are incorporated in inlets and outlets of reciprocal displacement micropumps, where they provide the liquid rectification needed for the valve to have a net pump flow in one direction. == References == Category:Valves Category:Microfluidics ","title":"Microvalve"},{"id":"56701700","text":"The Downtown Hartford Historic District in Hartford, Kentucky is a historic district which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.

Moore and his wife Harriette V. S. Moore were pioneer activists and leaders of the early civil rights movement in the United States, becoming the first martyrs of the movement. On the night of Christmas, December 25, 1951, a bomb that had been planted under the bedroom floor of the Moores' home in Mims, Florida exploded. They had celebrated their 25th wedding anniversary earlier that day. Harry died in the ambulance in transit from the attack, and his wife Harriette died from her injuries nine days later, on January 3, 1952. Their murder was the first assassination of any activist to occur during the civil rights movement, and the only time that a husband and wife were murdered during the history of the movement. ==Background== Harry Moore and Harriette Simms married in December 25, 1926 and moved into the Simms' family home the following fall. Harry was an educator, and Harriette was a former teacher turned insurance broker. In 1927, Harry was promoted to the position of principal at the local Titusville Colored School. The city's school system was racially segregated, like many in the country at the time. While Harry taught the school's ninth grade (the school taught grades one through nine), he also supervised the team of teachers at the school. The school was closed early his first year by the local school board just 6 months into the year, as part of the local school system's systemic discrimination against black children. The Moores had their first daughter in 1928, and moved into their own home with an acre of land given to them by Harriette's parents. They gave birth to their second daughter in 1930. Harriette returned to her career in education the following year, and later began working as a teacher for the same school as Harry. In 1934, Harry founded the Brevard County, Florida, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) chapter. He later served as the NAACP's first Executive Secretary in the state of Florida. The NAACP chapter worked towards achieving equal pay for equal work for teachers of any race, fought to get lynchings prosecuted, attempted to register black voters in the region. The activism of Moore was highly controversial in the local white-dominated county. In 1946 this resulted in the firings of Harry and Harriette from their teaching jobs by state authorities. Afterwards, Harry became a full-time employee of the NAACP. ==Murder== On the night of December 25, 1951, the Moores finished celebrating Christmas and their 25th wedding anniversary. When they later retired to their bedroom for the evening, a bomb exploded, injuring Harry and Harriette but leaving their daughter (who was at home at the time‚Äîthe other was in a different location) unharmed. The improvised explosive device, which was made from dynamite, had been placed directly under the Moores' bedroom floor. The Moores were rushed to the nearest hospital that would treat African-Americans in Sanford, Florida, a drive by car. Harry died while being transported; his wife Harriette lived to see her husband buried, before dying nine days later from her injuries. ==Investigations and motive== > Over the years, a number of motives have been suggested for the Moores' > murders. All of them share a common theme ‚Äî retribution against Harry Moore > for his civil rights activities. ‚Äî Charlie Crist, 35th Attorney General of > the State of Florida Since the night of the explosion in 1951, five separate criminal investigations have been initiated and completed. The first investigation was headed by the FBI beginning on the night of the explosion and concluding in 1955. The second investigation was a joint investigation by the Brevard County Sheriff's Office and Brevard County State Attorney's Office in 1978. The third investigation took place in 1991 by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE). In 2004, a fourth investigation was commenced by the Florida Attorney General's Office of Civil Rights. In 2008, the FBI again investigated the Moore homicides as part of the Department of Justice's \\"Cold Case Initiative\\". In total, the five criminal investigations revealed evidence implicating four subjects in the bombing. The four subjects were known to be high-ranking members within the Ku Klux Klan in the central region of Florida. The first of the four, Earl J. Brooklyn, was a Klansman with a reputation for being exceedingly violent and described as \\"a renegade\\" after being expelled from a Klavern of the Ku Klux Klan in Georgia for engaging in unsanctioned acts of violence. Brooklyn reportedly was in possession of floor plans of the Moore home, and was said to be recruiting volunteers to assist in the bombing. The second subject, Tillman H. \\"Curley\\" Belvin, was also reported to be a violent member of the Klan and a close friend of Brooklyn. Joseph Cox, another Klansman, was implicated in the bombing by a fellow Klansman, Edward L. Spivey. Spivey implicated Cox in a deathbed confession while suffering in the late stages of cancer in 1978. Cox committed suicide in 1952, one day after being confronted by the FBI. Brooklyn and Belvin both died while the FBI‚Äôs initial investigation was being conducted. Belvin died of natural causes in August 1952. Brooklyn died of natural causes on Christmas Day, 1952, one year to the day after the bombing. The investigation revealed that Harry's civil rights advocacy made him a known target of the Klan. No arrests were ever made in the case. All four of the subjects are now deceased. The Department of Justice Civil Rights Division closed the file on the federal investigation in 2011. ==Public reaction== During the early morning hours of the following day, December 26, 1951, angry men in Titusville's black neighborhoods were in the streets spreading word of the bombing. Within the following hours men and women, from Brevard County, still in their nightclothes walked and rode towards Mims to protest in the streets. Most of the people knew Moore personally, some via his job in education, some via the NAACP, and others through his registration drives. The assassination triggered nationwide protests, with rallies, memorials, and other events held following the news of the bombing. President Harry S Truman, and Governor Fuller Warren both received a high volume of telegrams and letters in protest of the murder of the civil rights activists in Mims, Florida. In New York City, a few weeks later on January 5, 1952, Jackie Robinson held a memorial service drawing approximately 3,000 mourners. The NAACP later held a memorial service, in March 1952, in the Madison Square Garden; their memorial was attended by 15,000 people, where speakers like Langston Hughes had come to give their respects. > And this he says, our Harry Moore As from the grave he cries No bomb can > kill the dreams I hold For freedom never dies!\\" ‚Äî Langston Hughes, (1951) ==Awards and tributes== In 1952, the year following the Moore's murders, Harry was posthumously awarded the NAACP's Spingarn Medal. In 1999, the site of the Moore's home in Mims, Florida, where the bombing occurred became an Historical Heritage Landmark of the State of Florida. Five years later Brevard County's local government christened the \\"Harry T. and Harriette Moore Memorial Park and Interpretive Center\\". ==See also== *Civil Rights Memorial *Crime in Florida *List of unsolved murders ==References== ==Bibliography== * * Category:1951 in Florida Category:1951 murders in the United States Category:Assassinated American civil rights activists Category:Assassinations in the United States Category:Attacks in the United States in 1951 Category:Deaths by explosive device Category:December 1951 events Category:Explosions in 1951 Category:Explosions in the United States Category:History of Brevard County, Florida Category:NAACP activists Category:People murdered in Florida Category:Racially motivated violence against African Americans Category:Terrorist incidents in Florida Category:Terrorist incidents in North America in 1951 Category:Terrorist incidents in the United States in the 1950s Category:Unsolved murders in the United States ","title":"Murder of Harry and Harriette Moore"},{"id":"56701792","text":"Thomas Sowler (1818-1891), Manchester newspaper proprietor Sir Thomas Sowler (7 July 1818 ‚Äì 4 April 1891) was an English newspaper proprietor in Manchester. == Early life == Thomas Sowler was born in Manchester to Thomas and Helen Sowler, one of three sons and three daughters. He bore the same name as his father, who in common with his grandfather, had been a printer. The family claimed descent from a Baron Sowler of Normandy and carried on their business initially at Hunt's Bank and later in St Ann's Square, both in Manchester. Thomas Sowler senior established the Manchester Courier newspaper in 1825 and upon his death the business was passed to Thomas junior, who had been educated at Manchester Grammar School, and another son, John. == Career == The brothers sold the book-selling part of their father's business and in 1864 converted the newspaper from a weekly to a daily publication, eventually expanding it from the then common four-page format to one that had twelve or more pages. John died in 1871, leaving Thomas as the sole proprietor of the Conservative Party-supporting organ. In 1874, Sowler established the Manchester Evening Mail and in 1889 he was appointed as the first president of the restructured National Association of Journalists. Sowler was a director of the Manchester Royal Exchange and on the board of several other businesses, as well as being involved with other institutions such as the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society and the Manchester Natural History Society. He was also a co-founder of the Manchester Free Library and the first secretary of the Manchester branch of the Church Defence Association. Away from business, Sowler was involved with the military from the time of the \\"Defence not Defiance\\" movement in the 1860s. He joined the 19th Lancashire Volunteer Artillery as a gunner and rose through the ranks to become Lieutenant-Colonel in command of the regiment. In 1874, he resigned from that position and soon after was appointed as successor to the recently dead John Isaac Mawson, who had been Honorary Colonel of the regiment. == Politics == In the 1886 general election, Sowler stood as a Conservative Party candidate in the Manchester South constituency, where he lost by around 350 votes to Sir Henry Roscoe. He was a Justice of the Peace and chairman of both the Manchester Conservative Association and the Conservative Club around the time of his being appointed a Knight Bachelor in the 1890 New Year Honours. == Death and family == Sowler lived at Oak Bank, Victoria Park, Manchester from 1877. He died there on 4 April 1891 and was buried at the Church of St Mary the Virgin, Bowdon. He had married on 25 July 1866 and had several children. His wife, Emily, was the daughter of James Yates, a bleacher. Sowler's sons, notably Thomas and Harry, continued to run his newspapers as a limited company and expanded the stable to include titles such as the Manchester Examiner. == References == Notes Citations Category:1818 births Category:1891 deaths Category:People educated at Manchester Grammar School Category:English newspaper founders Category:Businesspeople from Manchester Category:Knights Bachelor Category:Businesspeople awarded knighthoods Category:Conservative Party (UK) parliamentary candidates Category:Justices of the peace ","title":"Thomas Sowler"},{"id":"56701843","text":"The Old Town Historic District in Hartford, Kentucky is a historic district which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.

He quickly became indispensable thanks to savoury compositions that his talent as an actor enriched in a very personal way. Countless Sacristians of Tosca (with R√©gine Crespin and Albert Lance), to Goro in Madame Butterfly, Puccini's La Boh√®me, where he alternately plays Marcel, Benoit, (side by side with Martha Angelici) were offered to him to interpret each evening, during an abundant secondary career within the , until the early sixties. Francis Poulenc, appreciating him, acknowledged him a \\"chic and admirable diction\\" - \\"Happy father who has such a gifted child\\", will write the great French composer about him. In 1947, Jacques Hivert recorded and created in the Salle Favard, the role of the son in Poulenc's Les mamelles de Tir√©sias alongside Denise Duval, a partner he will often work again with, particularly in Jacques Ibert's Ang√©lique, Manuel Rosenthal's La Poule NoireLa Poule Noire on Gallica and in Henri B√ºsser's '. In 1948, he flew to Buenos Aires, replacing his singing teacher Roger Bourdin, to perform Charlot, in Angelique (opera), in front of Evita Per√≥n. Skillfully disguised and unrecognizable, he will embody highly convincing characters of all ages. Darius Milhaud's Le pauvre matelot, Andr√© Messager's Monsieur Beaucaire, Guillot de Morfontaine in Puccini's Manon, will remain among his remarkable compositions. Married to the French contralto Denise Scharley of the Paris Op√©ra, he opened the doors of the Carmel of Compi√®gne to her where, for the first time in 1971, the Carmelites agreed to participate behind the grids in the concert he organised with his friend tenor Louis Rialland,Louis Rialland on artlyriquefr of the Dialogues des Carm√©lites, even singing religious songs of Francis Poulenc's opera. On the strength of this experience and supported by Georges Auric and Henri Sauguet, the survivors of \\"Les Six\\" chaired by Darius Milhaud, who wished to save the work, he will direct his wife on the provincial stages in this work where she remains unequalled as Premi√®re Prieur. While the latter embodies this leading role on the stage of the Paris Op√©ra in 1972 in a fanciful and contested staging by Raymond Rouleau, Jacques Hivert alone, faithful to the composer's wishes, won unanimous approval from critics. He will once again stage Denise Scharley in one of her leading roles, Madame Flora in Gian-Carlo Menotti's The Medium.

Gjellerups Forlag, was a publishing house and bookshop located in Copenhagen, Denmark. Gjellerups Forlag is no longer operated as an independent subsidiary but the name Gjellerup survives as a brand for publication of textbooks for law students and other legal literature. ==History== Jul. Gjellerups Forlag was founded on 15 March 1883 when 25-year-old Julius Gjellerup (1858-1917) opened a combined publishing house and bookshop on the square S√∏lvtorvet in the new district that was emerging after the decommissioning of Copenhagen's fortifications. Early publications of fiction included Dansk Folkebibliotek, a series of translations of international classics for 25 √∏re published in collaboration with P. Hauberg & Co, as well as works by new Danish writers such as Martin Andersen Nex√∏ and Johan Skjoldborg. With the opening in 1900 of the new Polytechnical College on the other side of the square, Gjellerup began to specialize in technical textbooks and other scientific literature. In 1903, his fictional portfolio was sold to E. Jespersens Forlag and from then on the publishing hose focused exclusively on school books and other nonfiction. Gjellerup's widow Anine Gjellerup (1862-1943) took on the company after his sudden death on 6 June 1917, assisted by Harald Jensen as manager of the publishing house and Jens Peter Olsen as manager of the bookshop. In 1935 Harald Jensen took on the position as CEI of the company as well as of Nordisk Atlasfabrik. With Anine Gjellerup's death on 30 June 1943, ownership of the company passed to the daughters Karen Hartmann-Bornebusch and Inger Gjellerup Andersen. The company relocated to R√∏mersgade 11 in 1960. On 1 April 1972, the company was converted into a limited company (aktieselskab) with P.E. Bj√∏rrild as new CEO. In 1974 the company was converted into an anpartsselskab (Aps). The company was acquired by G.E.C. Gad on 1 April 1984. The bookshop is merged into Harcks Boghandel at the corner of Fiolstr√¶de and N√∏rre Voldgade, which has been renamed to Hack og Gjellerup.

This criticism has been highlighted by articles in the national press, including The Daily Mirror,, The Times, and Schools Week.

The address is 5745 Ogeechee Rd, Savannah. The site is over consisting of a large estate granted to James Deveaux in 1756, and was named for the many cedar trees on the property. An additional 500 acres were granted to Phillip Delegal in 1758 and eventually became part of the plantation. The site was purchased by Joseph Habersham in 1802. Habersham sold it in 1804 to George W. Anderson who built the main house that was rebuilt and added on to after the American Civil War. Anderson's son, George Wayne Anderson, JR Commanded Fort McAllister in the Civil War, and after the fort fell, Lebanon became his prison and the headquarters of the Fifteenth Army Corps of the US Army. After occupation, the main house at Lebanon was partially destroyed, and foreclosed upon in 1868. It was recovered by George W. Anderson in 1871. The extent of the damage to the original house is not known, but was rebuilt and repaired by April 23, 1873.Savannah Morning News, April 23, 1873. Anderson later divided the property and allowed French immigrants to form a colony called L'Esperance. They planted and cultivated vineyards that did not succeed. In 1916, Mills B. Lane of Savannah purchased the plantation from the Anderson family heirs, and grew a new variety of orange, called the Savannah Satsuma. The plantation remains a working plantation today, much in the same manner it has for over two centuries. ==Geographic setting== Entrance to Lebanon Plantation Lebanon Plantation is situated approximately southeast of downtown Savannah in Georgia's Lower Coastal Plain region. Located at 5475 Ogeechee Road, just off historic Highway 17. ==History== ===Early history=== Lebanon Plantation Live Oak Native Americans have probably inhabited the area on at least a semi-annual basis for thousands of years, as indicated by oyster shell deposits excavated in the vicinity. By the time European explorers arrived in the area in the 16th century, the area was claimed by the Yuchi and the Creek tribe. When the first permanent English colonists landed at what is now Savannah in 1733, the area was part of the domain of the Yamacraw, a detached branch of the Creeks, although the area was apparently uninhabited at the time. James Oglethorpe, the leader of these English colonists, maintained a friendly relationship with the Yamacraw chief Tomochichi, and managed to peacefully acquire the Savannah area and the lands in its vicinity.Georgia Department of Natural Resources, \\"Wormsloe State Historic Site.\\" Retrieved: 12 September 2008. Throughout the late 17th-century, Spain (which had established itself in Florida in the previous century) retained loose control over the Georgia coast via Native American allies. This inevitably brought them into conflict with the growing English colonies to the north, namely North Carolina and South Carolina. In 1702, South Carolina governor James Moore led an expedition against Spanish settlements in Florida and, en route, raided and destroyed the Spanish Native American missions off the Georgia coast. While Spain still claimed the coast and islands, the area was largely abandoned, creating a buffer zone between Spanish Florida and the English Carolinas. In the early 1730s, the English decided to colonize the islands between the Carolinas and Florida. A charter was granted in 1732, and the first colonists set sail in the same year. The English colonists that arrived at Savannah in 1733 formed the core of what would eventually become the colony and state of Georgia. ===Establishment of Lebanon Plantation=== Lebanon Plantation cedars Nearby, Noble Jones' fortified house was one of several defensive works built between Frederica on Saint Simons Island and the Savannah townsite. The English were concerned that the Spanish still claimed the area and would eventually attempt to expel them. Conflict erupted in 1739 with the outbreak of the War of Jenkins' Ear, the name for the regional theater of the greater War of the Austrian Succession. Jones took part in an English raid along the St. Johns River in northern Florida in 1740, as well as the successful defense of Frederica at the Battle of Bloody Marsh in 1742.Coulter, 56-63. The end of the war in 1748 largely neutralized Spanish threats to the new colony. The land that would become Lebanon Plantation was granted to James Deveaux in 1756. An additional 500 acres was granted to Phillip Delegal in 1758, that eventually became part of the plantation. ===Antebellum Lebanon=== The practice of slavery had been banned by Georgia's original charter, so many land owners used indentured servant labor to tend the fields in many plantation's early years. When the Trustees revoked the ban on slavery in 1749, most turned to slave labor in order to make them profitable. During the American Civil War (1861‚Äì1865), Lebanon was occupied and served as the headquarters of the Fifteenth Army Corps, under the Command of General William Babcock Hazen. After the fall of Fort McAllister, its Commander, George Wayne Anderson Jr. was imprisoned in his own home. General Hazen and Lt. Col. Strong invited General William Tecumseh Sherman to dinner, to celebrate their victory. In a kind gesture of respect, General Hazen also invited Major Anderson to attend the meal, after clearing the request with Sherman.Shaara, p. 265 The discussion was surely lively - during the meal Anderson engaged in a heated exchange with General Sherman about the tactics employed to defend the fortDurham, p. 169 and the bravery of all who fought there. Cigars were exchanged and smoked, tributes were made to the fallen.Smith, p. 179 ===Lebanon in the 20th century=== Lebanon Plantation main house 1916 Lebanon Plantation reflects the organic architectural growth of a plantation house continually occupied through several generations. From its antebellum origins, destruction and rebirth after the Civil War, Reconstruction and remodeling, the main house has retained its identity and character. The Neo-Classical veranda of the twentieth century coexists with the core of the house built in the Greek Revival style of the nineteenth century. ===Lebanon Plantation today=== Lebanon Plantation Today Lebanon's Verdant Kitchen produces beverages, baked goods, candies, snacks and spices available at regional farmers markets, online and in specialty gourmet and grocery stores. The ginger crops, including turmeric and galangal ‚Äî also known as Thai ginger ‚Äî are grown and harvested at Lebanon Plantation, then sliced, dried and ground at raw food temperature in the plantation's USDA-certified organic processing facility.

His maternal uncle was Sir James Ashe, 2nd Baronet and his brothers were William Windham and Joseph Windham Ashe. The Windham family had had a seat at Felbrigg Hall since the mid-15th century. Whilst at Eton College he succeeded his father in 1689. After attending King's College, Cambridge, he took a grand tour round Italy between 1693 and 1696. In 1708, he was due to marry Hester Buckworth, but she died, and a year later, in summer 1709, he married a wealthy heiress, Elizabeth Dobyns, the daughter and heir of William Dobyns of Lincoln's Inn. ==Parliamentary career== Windham was first considered as a parliamentary candidate in 1699, for Norfolk (his father had unsuccessfully run for it in 1679 as a Whig). However, according to Humphrey Prideaux, his grand tour counted against him: Windham stepped down from the 1705 election campaign in favour of his friend and cousin Roger Townshend, whom he replaced at the 1708 British general election, contesting the seat unopposed and becoming the first of his family to sit in Parliament. That year he was said to possess \\"as great estate as any commoner in the country\\". Windham was one of the main MPs behind an unsuccessful address to Queen Anne on 25 January 1709 requesting that she remarry. He voted for the naturalization of the Palatines in 1709 and for the impeachment of Dr Sacheverell in 1710. He and Robert Walpole II stood for Norfolk at the 1710 British general election but were defeated and he declined to stand again in 1713. ==Later life and legacy== Windham's marriage failed, and after the birth of a son in 1717, the couple parted. He retired to Felbrigg to manage his estates and look after the education of his son. He also had one illegitimate daughter. A portrait of Windham by Sir Godfrey Kneller is owned by the National Trust and held at Felbrigg. ==References== Category:1673 births Category:1749 deaths Category:Members of the Parliament of Great Britain for Norfolk Category:British MPs 1708‚Äì1710 ","title":"Ashe Windham"},{"id":"56702309","text":"Catherine (Cathinca) Caroline Engelhart Amyot (1845‚Äì1926) was a Danish painter who specialized in portraits and genre works. She travelled widely, creating a number of works of historical interest. In 1869 she began exhibiting in D√ºsseldorf and Copenhagen. After marrying the English physician, Thomas Amyon, from 1879 to 1890 she exhibited frequently in the Paris Salon and in London's Royal Academy of Arts. ==Early life and education== Catherine Engelhart: King Carl Johan as king of Norway (1875) Born in Copenhagen on 6 February 1845, Catherine Caroline Engelhart was the adopted daughter of the National Bank official Christian Engelhart and his wife Nathalie n√©e R√∏nne. She was raised in Copenhagen where she was taught to draw and paint by the Danish painter Carl B√∏gh (1865‚Äì66) but, wishing to keep abreast of the latest developments in art, she travelled abroad from 1867. After first moving to Brussels, she settled in D√ºsseldorf for seven years, studying under the Swiss artist Benjamin Vautier and the German Karl Ferdinand Sohn. ==Painting career== From 1869, Engelhart exhibited in Copenhagen's Kunsthal Charlottenborg as well as in D√ºsseldorf. The most successful painting she exhibited in Copenhagen was Ingen roser uden torne (No Roses without Thorns, 1874) which was purchased by the Danish Art Society Kunstforeningen. She travelled to Christiania (now Oslo) in 1875 and then to Stockholm where she painted two posthumous portraits of King Carl Johan as king of Norway. They had been commissioned by King Oscar II. One of them now hangs in the Bernadotte Parlour in the Royal Palace in Oslo. After returning to Denmark for a short stay in Copenhagen, she embarked on another study trip, this time to Paris. Here she studied from 1876 under William-Adolphe Bouguereau who considered her to be one of his best students. While in Paris, she met the English medical doctor Thomas Howse Edward Amyot whom she married on 16 May 1878. Thereafter, the couple moved to England where they settled first in Norfolk and from 1882 in London. Many of her later paintings were genre works, often depicting her daughter Catherine Florence as a model. ==Family and later life== Catherine and Thomas Amyot had three children, all born in Diss, Norfolk: Thomas (born 1879), Catherine Florence (born 1880) and Noel Ethel (born 1882). There are records of the Amyots living in Kensington (1891) and in Margate (1901). Thomas Amyot died in late 1903. Little is known about Catherine Amyot's later life but she died in S√®vres, southwest of Paris, in 1926. ==Paintings== Catherine Engelhart Amyot Ingen roser uden torne.jpgIngen roser uden torne (1874) Catherine Engelhart Amyot A Special Treat-crop.jpgA Treat for the Puppy (1887) Catherine Engelhart Amyot La soir√©e parisienne 1904.jpgLa soir√©e parisienne (1904) Catherine-caroline- engelhart-a-self-portrait.jpgA Self Portrait Catherine Engelhart Amyot Daydreams.jpgDaydreams Catherine Engelhart Amyot An armful of mischief.jpgAn Armful of Mischief ==References== Category:1845 births Category:1926 deaths Category:Artists from Copenhagen Category:19th-century Danish painters Category:Danish emigrants to France Category:Danish women painters Category:19th-century Danish women artists Category:20th-century Danish women artists ","title":"Catherine Engelhart Amyot"},{"id":"56702335","text":"Erdu Township () is a township of Shimen County in Hunan, China.

In 2016, Calk approved large loans from his bank to Paul Manafort, Donald Trump's former campaign manager. On May 23, 2019, Calk was indicted by the Southern District of New York for financial institution bribery for allegedly approving $16 million in loans to Manafort in exchange for help in securing a high-ranking position with the Trump administration, such as Treasury, Commerce or Defense secretary. == Early career == Calk was born in Detroit, Michigan, and was raised in Florida, Illinois, and London. He attended the United States Military Academy Preparatory School, and is a 1983 graduate of the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign. Calk received a Master of Business Administration degree from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University, and has also completed courses for senior executives at the Harvard Business School. Calk received a commission as an Army officer, and served as a helicopter pilot from 1985 to 2001, including both active and reserve duty. Calk's banking career began in Kansas, where, with his brother John, he focused on issuing mortgages on single-family homes to veterans. Before he ran the Federal Savings Bank of Chicago, Calk was president and co-owner of Chicago Bancorp, which has been described as \\"once one of the largest privately held retail mortgage banks in the country.\\" It was dissolved in 2012. Calk, Chicago Bancorp, and the Federal Savings Bank of Chicago were sued in 2012 and again in 2014 by CitiMortgage, for alleged inaccuracies and misrepresentations in loans that Calk's enterprises had originated and later sold to CitiMortgage. Calk moved his bank's headquarters to Chicago in 2014 after the city offered him tax breaks. In 2014, the Federal Savings Bank of Chicago signed an agreement to cooperate with the New York City real estate firm Douglas Elliman, and in exchange, either Douglas Elliman or its parent company, the Vector Group, invested $2 million in Calk's bank, according to a 2015 deposition by Howard Lorber, the Vector Group's CEO. The collaboration foundered, however, and was terminated in 2014. In his 2015 deposition, Lorber called Calk difficult to work with and called Calk's account of their collaboration \\"completely delusional.\\" Lorber, a longtime friend and ally of Trump's, later served with Calk on the Trump campaign's economic council. == Loans to Paul Manafort == Manafort first got in touch with Calk's Federal Savings Bank of Chicago in April 2016, according to testimony given by the bank's senior vice president Dennis Raico at Manafort's August 2018 trial for fraud and tax evasion. Manafort, Calk, and Raico discussed loans and politics over dinner in New York in May 2016. On July 28, Calk became directly involved in discussions about loans to Manafort and his son-in-law for investment properties, which Raico told the court was unusual. Subsequently, over a lunch, Calk and Manafort discussed another loan. On October 6, 2016, Manafort emailed Calk to say that he had been mistaken in saying at this lunch that he owed $2.5 million on a Bridgehampton, New York, property that he intended to use as collateral. In fact he owed $3 million. \\"I must have had a blackout,\\" Manafort wrote in his email. On October 16, Manafort asked to change the terms of the loan, requesting a line of credit on the property instead of using it as collateral for a construction loan for a California property. In his application materials for the loan, Manafort provided a 2016 income statement for himself that his business partner Rick Gates later testified was false. James Brennan, another vice president at the bank, testified at Manafort's trial that Manafort failed to declare in his application materials that two of his New York properties were already mortgaged and that Manafort's statements about his income in 2015 were inconsistent. Brennan also testified that bank employees had noticed that Manafort seemed to have no income as of July 2016, though he claimed to be owed $2.4 million, and that he was more than 90 days late on a $300,000 credit card bill. Concerns within the bank about the propriety of the loan were overruled by Calk, however, and on November 16, 2016, Manafort received from Calk's bank a $9.5 million cash-out refinance loan on a house in Bridgehampton, New York. \\"It closed because Mr. Calk wanted it to close,\\" Brennan testified. On January 4, 2017, Manafort received an additional loan from Calk's bank, a $6.5 million construction loan on a property on Union Street in New York City. The two loans, totalling about $16 million, were the largest and second-largest ever issued by the bank. The combined size of the loans at the time represented around 5 percent of the bank's asset base of $341 million, and represented about 22 percent of the bank's equity capital of $72 million. The bank has since written the loans off as a loss. == Investigation == At a 2018 bail hearing and in a superseding indictment filed against Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, the office of U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller alleged that Manafort had fraudulently applied for around $16 million in loans from \\"Lender D,\\" reported by multiple sources at the time as the Federal Savings Bank of Chicago, before and shortly after the 2016 presidential election. In court filings Mueller alleged that Manafort had doctored financial statements from his lobbying firm, \\"overstating its income by millions of dollars,\\" and had committed a \\"series of bank loans and bank loan conspiracies.\\" In February 2018 the Wall Street Journal and other media outlets reported that Mueller's office was investigating whether there had been a quid pro quo arrangement in which Calk approved the loans in return for a position in the Trump administration as Secretary of the Army. Calk had been named to the Trump campaign's economic advisory panel in August 2016, at Manafort's suggestion, several months after they had begun discussing a possible loan for Manafort. During Manafort's August 2018 trial, prosecutors introduced as evidence emails from Calk showing that on August 4, 2016, he wrote Manafort that \\"I am happy and willing to serve,\\" and that in November, just after Trump's election, he sent Manafort a resume and a request to be nominated Secretary of the Army, adding that he would also be willing to serve as chief of the departments of Treasury, Commerce, Housing or Urban Development, and Defense, or as ambassador to the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Japan, Ireland, Australia, China, United Nations, the European Union, Portugal, the Vatican, Luxembourg, Austria, Switzerland, the Netherlands, or Singapore. After Trump's election, Calk instructed Dennis Raico, a senior vice president for Calk's bank, to ask Manafort whether Calk might be named Secretary of the Treasury or Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, according to testimony at Manafort's trial by Raico, although Raico also testified that, embarrassed by the request, he never did ask. During the presidential transition, Manafort wrote in an email to his former deputy Rick Gates, then serving on the inauguration committee, that \\"we need to discuss Steve Calk for Secretary of Army.\\" On November 30, 2016, Manafort sent an email to Jared Kushner recommending Calk be named Secretary of the Army, to which Kushner replied, \\"On it!\\" Shortly before Christmas 2016, Manafort added Calk and Calk's son to a list of people to be invited to Trump's inauguration. Calk did not become a finalist for any government positions in the Trump administration. ===Indictment=== In May 2019, Calk was charged in the Southern District of New York with a single count of financial bribery related to the investigation mentioned above and ties to Paul Manafort. He is currently on bail awaiting trial. == References == == External links == * Federal Savings Bank of Chicago Category:1960s births Category:American chief executives of financial services companies Category:Kellogg School of Management alumni Category:Living people Category:Trump administration personnel Category:United States Army aviators Category:United States Army officers Category:University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign alumni Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Stephen Calk"},{"id":"56702524","text":"The Occupation is a single-player video game developed by White Paper Games and released on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Microsoft Windows on 5 March 2019. The game takes place in a single government building, in real-time over four hours. The game advances with or without input from the player, but almost all in-game actions can affect the game's story. The game is set in late 1987 within the same universe as White Paper Games' first title Ether One. ==Gameplay== The game does not have a health bar or energy system, when the game needs to punish the player it does so by using up the player's time, for example if a player is caught doing something they should not, they are taken to a security office and lose 15 minutes of game time, which shortens the time available to achieve the main aim of the game, obtaining knowledge. ==Plot== Prior to the start of the game; a terrorist attack has killed 23 people and led the British Government to create The Union Act, a \\"controversial act which threatens the civil liberties of the British population.\\" The game's plot starts at 3:27 PM on 24 October 1987. The player character is a journalist that is researching The Union Act, players have freedom of choice on how to act; become a whistle blowing journalist fighting against the act, or do nothing as the game progresses on its own. ==Development== The game was developed on Unreal 4 and uses dynamic artificial intelligence, which combines scripted activities for the in-game characters, along with deviations to their normal routine based on their in-game requirements or interactions. The developers illustrated this by explaining the actions of a character called Dan, a Scottish Muslim who is a \\"towering bald man who screams security\\", he breaks his usual desk based routine, because of his need to pray at certain times, creating a circumstance that the player can take advantage of should they wish. ==Reception== ===Awards=== The game was nominated for \\"Best Use of Game Engine\\" at the Develop:Star Awards. ==References== == External links == * The Occupation - game site Category:2019 video games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:Windows games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Video games set in the United Kingdom Category:Video games set in 1987 Category:Stealth video games Category:Unreal Engine games Category:Single-player video games Category:Xbox One games Category:Humble Bundle ","title":"The Occupation"},{"id":"56702526","text":"Guro Kleven Hagen (born 11 May 1994) is a Norwegian violinist raised in Fagernes.

She served between 1959 and 1995 as president of the La D√©p√™che du Midi newspaper group, while pursuing a parallel career as a regional politician. In 1970 she became president of the departmental council for Tarn-et-Garonne, a department in the southwest of France. Membership of departmental councils had been based on universal male suffrage since 1848, and on universal adult suffrage since 1944, but it was only in 1970 that √âvelyne Baylet became the first president of any departmental council in France who was also a woman. == Life == === Provenance and early years === √âvelyne Isaac and her twin brother were born into a Jewish family in Batna, a substantial inland city in northeastern Algeria. Her grandparents had moved across from Alsace after 1871. Maurice Simon Isaac (1882-), her father, was a Corps des mines member. Her mother was a school teacher. She pursued her studies at the girl's lyc√©e at Constantine, and then at the University of Algiers from which she successfully graduated (with so-called \\"Kh√¢gne\\" and \\"Hypokh√¢gne\\" pre-university degree qualifications). Between 1937 and 1940 she taught French, Latin and Greek at a girls' school in at B√¥ne (as Annaba was known at that time). === Marriage and war years === On 30 December 1940 √âvelyne Isaac married Jean Baylet (1904-1959), a Radical Party politician and director of the D√©p√™che de Toulouse (regional newspaper). They had met while √âvelyne was accompanying her mother who was undergoing a cure at Ax-les- Thermes. The ceremony took place in Jean Baylet's home town, Valence-d'Agen. The marriage would produce three recorded children including the politician- journalist Jean-Michel Baylet. By 2014 there were also seven grandchildren and six great grandchildren. In September 1939 Germany and the Soviet Union invaded Poland. France reacted (along with Britain) by declaring war on Germany. Eight months later, in May 1940, Germany invaded France: by the end of July 1940 a puppet government, based in Vichy, was administering approximately the southern half of France (including Toulouse). In 1943 Joseph L√©cussan, a senior Vichy official, launched an enquiry in the region on behalf of the \\"Commissariat g√©n√©ral\\" into the \\"Jewish question\\". √âvelyne Baylet hastened to disappear, changing her name to Eliane Bories. Liberation came in June 1944 and ushered in a period of fevered recrimination. The D√©p√™che de Toulouse faced a ban and its premises were sequestrated because, during the German occupation, the newspaper had been taken over by \\"collaborateurs\\" and published. Jean Baylet had been elected as mayor of Valence-d'Agen in 1930 and remained in office throughout (and long after) the Vichy years, but he had taken care, if quietly, to distance himself from the collaborationist authorities, refusing to hang the portrait of Marshal P√©tain on his office wall at the town hall. Any residual suspicions that he was too close to the Germans were helpfully undermined on 9 June 1944, very shortly before liberation, by the Gestapo who suspected him of helping the R√©sistance and arrested him. === Aftermath of Vichy === Starting in 1944, Jean and √âvelyne Baylet spent two years assembling evidence of their \\"R√©sistance credentials\\" and submitting applications to have the newspaper business returned to the family. With the need for secrecy gone, there was abundance evidence available from numerous well placed witnesses of the extent of the practical help Jean Baylet had given to those opposing the German occupation. In 1946 they obtained the necessary \\"ordonnance de non-lieu\\", confirming that they were not to be pursued as suspected \\"Vichy collaborators\\".Antoinette Fouque, Mireille Calle-Gruber et B√©atrice Didier (dir.), Le Dictionnaire universel des cr√©atrices, √âditions des femmes. The times were uncertain and lawless, however, and the Bayets were still prevented from returning to the newspaper offices. On 24 October 1947 Jean Baylet turned up at the newspaper's Toulouse offices accompanied by the rugby team from nearby Valence-d'Agen. By this time it was six months since a court had formally restored the newspaper to him, but the individuals occupying the offices had turned a deaf ear to the court. Now, however, they were persuaded to depart. At the same time, the newspaper's Paris office was recovered. √âvelyne Baylet had already spent a considerable amount of time in Paris, pleading with officials at all the government ministries that might be persuaded to show support, but this had failed to achieve a result. She therefore turned up early at the newspaper's offices in the prestigious Rue du Faubourg-Montmartre, accompanied by Maurice Bourg√®s- Maunoury. Later, in 1957, Bourg√®s-Maunoury would serve (briefly) as Prime Minister of France, but in 1947 he was merely an ambitious young opposition politician and, importantly, a witness of what happened next. The two of them installed themselves in the best arm chairs, to await the arrival of the \\"new master\\" of the place. When he arrived and asked what they were doing there, they explained they were doing the same as he was: \\"occupying the place\\". The ensuing conversation, as reported, was brief and to the point. The Paris offices were recovered. The newspaper returned to the streets in its southwest heartland on 22 November 1947, now renamed La D√©p√™che du Midi. During the next twelve years the newspaper recovered its authority and its political \\"king- maker\\" status in the region defined approximately by a circle with a radius of approximately 100 kilometers surrounding Toulouse. === The young widow === Jean Baylet died relatively young, in a motor accident: he collided at high speed with a tree after a motor cyclist cut across his path, on 29 May 1959, The next day his widow appeared at the printing plant and told the assembled employees \\"I am going to take over the direction of this newspaper\\" (\\"Je vais assumer la direction de ce journal\\"). She had little obvious relevant experience, while legally 76% of the ownership of the business passed directly to her teenage children. But, as she later explained, she thought she was \\"best places to look after the interests of the newspaper\\", and over the next forty years that is what she did. In order to anticipate any who doubted her intentions, she joined her late husband's name to her own. Mme √âvelyne Baylet became Mme √âvelyne-Jean Baylet. === Politics === She also assumed her husband's political mantle. Jean Baylet had served as mayor of Valence-d'Agen since 1930. √âvelyne-Jean Baylet succeeded him between 1959 and 1977, after which the position passed to the couple's son, Jean-Michel Baylet. There was nothing seamless about that succession, however. It involved a fierce contest that ended up in a court case. Jean-Michel Baylet's rival for the mayoral office in 1977 was Dani√®le Malet-Baylet, his elder sister. As mayor from 1959 √âvelyne-Jean Baylet also followed her late husband in representing Valence-d'Agen as conseiller g√©n√©ral at the departmental level. She sat as a member of the Radical Party, switching after 1973 to the newly relaunched Radical Party of the Left (\\"Mouvement des Radicaux de Gauche\\" / MRG). Ten years after taking over her husband's place on the Departmental council for Tarn-et-Garonne, in 1970 √âvelyne-Jean Baylet took over as council president, the first woman to take on such a position anywhere in France. === Final years === In 2012, now aged 99, √âvelyne-Jean Baylet retired from her most enduring position, being her directorship of the La D√©p√™che du Midi newspaper group. Her place was taken by Jean-Nicolas Baylet, her grandson. She died just over two years later. == Awards and honours == * Commander of the Legion of Honour * Officer of the National Order of Merite * Commander of the Order of Academic Palms * Chevalier of the Order of Agricultural Merit == References == Category:20th-century French newspaper publishers (people) Category:French women in business Category:Women mayors of places in France Category:French general councillors Category:Politicians from Occitanie Category:Republican Party (France) politicians Category:Radical Party of the Left politicians Category:University of Algiers alumni Category:French centenarians Category:Commandeurs of the L√©gion d'honneur Category:Officers of the National Order of Merit (France) Category:Commandeurs of the Ordre des Palmes Acad√©miques Category:Knights of the Order of Agricultural Merit Category:People from Batna, Algeria Category:1913 births Category:2014 deaths Category:20th-century businesswomen Category:Women centenarians ","title":"√âvelyne Baylet"},{"id":"56702583","text":"Two ships of the Royal Navy have borne the name HMS Southdown: * was a minesweeper launched in 1917 and sold in 1926. * was a launched in 1940 and scrapped in 1956.

He showed little ability as a two-year-old, showing no worthwhile form in six starts. In the following year he made steady progress, winning seven races, culminating with an upset victory in the St Leger Stakes. He was subsequently retired to stud but had no success as a sire of winners. ==Background== Challacombe was a bay horse with a white star bred by F W Dunn. As a yearling he was put up for auction at Doncaster and was bought for 570 guineas by Alec Taylor Jr. on behalf of the American-born Washington Singer. Taylor, who trained the horse at Manton, Wiltshire, later expressed his disappointment that the colt had never been entered in the Epsom Derby. The horse was named after a small village in Devon. He was sired by St Serf who won the Rous Memorial Stakes and went on to sire several other good horses included the 1000 Guineas winner Thais. Challacombe's dam Lady Chancellor was a distant, female-line descendant of the dam of the Epsom Oaks winner Nike. ==Racing career== ===1904: two-year-old season=== Until 1946 two-year-old racehorses in Britain did not have to be given official names and the colt who was to become Challacombe raced unnamed as a juvenile in 1904. The colt made no impact, as he failed to win or place in any of his six races. ===1905: three-year-old season=== The still unnamed colt returned in the spring of 1905 and began to make steady progress. He won the Union Jack Stakes over one mile at Liverpool in April and the Wood Ditton Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse later that month. In May he followed up by taking the Tudor Plate at Sandown Park and the Chippenham Plate over one and a half miles at Newmarket. At Royal Ascot in June he finished unplaced in both the Gold Vase and the Triennial Stakes. In July he ran for the first time under the name Challacombe and won the Coombe Plate over one mile at Sandown Park. Later that month he was moved up in class for the Duchess of York Plate over ten furlongs at Hurst Park he finished third behind the Oaks winner Cherry Lass. The colt returned to Hurst Park in August and finished second to Costly Lady in the Holiday Plate. On his final race before contesting the St Leger Challacombe contested the weight- for-age Newdigate Stakes over one and a half miles at Gatwick Racecourse in early September, and won \\"very easily\\" from the four-year-old St Denis. 130th running of the St Leger over fourteen and a half furlongs at Doncaster Racecourse on 13 September was much anticipated as the field was expected to include the season's three outstanding three-year-olds, Cicero, Val d'Or and Cherry Lass. When Cicero was withdrawn with a leg injury, and Val d'Or was prevented from crossing the English Channel from France by rough weather, Cherry Lass became the clear favourite. The race was run in wet and \\"dismal\\" conditions but nevertheless attracted the customary huge crowd. Cherry Lass went off at odds of 6/4 ahead of Llangibby (third to Val d'Or and Cicero in the Eclipse Stakes) and Polymelus with Challacombe, ridden by Otto Madden the 16/1 fourth choice in an eight-runner field. It was reported that Challacombe, who was equipped with blinkers, had been considered unlikely to run in the race until the withdrawals of Cicero and Val d'Or. Challacombe was not among the early leaders but drew alongside the tiring Cherry Lass in the straight before pulling away to win \\"easily\\" by three lengths from Polymelus with the favourite three lengths back in third place. The winning time of 3:05.4 was a new record for the race. Challacombe ended the year with earnings of ¬£6,847 making him the sixth most financially successful horse of the season. ===1906: four-year-old season=== Challacombe remained in training as a four-year-old but failed to win any major races. ==Assessment and honours== In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Challacombe an \\"average\\" winner of the St Leger. ==Stud record== Challacombe retired from racing to become a breeding stallion but had no success as a sire of winners. Challacombe was euthanised on 8 January 1917. ==Pedigree== ==References== Category:1902 racehorse births Category:1917 racehorse deaths Category:Racehorses bred in the United Kingdom Category:Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom Category:Thoroughbred family 32 Category:St Leger winners ","title":"Challacombe (horse)"},{"id":"56702662","text":"Map of the general region, with the canal shown in the centre Canal Uchusuma is a canal in Chile. The canal begins at the northeastern foot of Cerro Huancune on the Uchusuma River, a principal tributary of the Mauri River; the diversion occurs at the locality Ancochaullanta at elevation. The path of the canal takes it southeastward through Peruvian territory until the Peru-Chile border at Laguna Blanca. It continues through Chilean territory from Laguna Blanca along the Arica-La Paz railway southwestward between the mountains Tacora and Caracarani, close to the Canal Mauri. It turns around Tacora's southern flank to its western side while following a low-altitude moraine, crosses the Rio Azufre westward and then the border between Chile and Peru. In Peru it continues southwestward and ends between the mountains of Cerro Huaylillas and Cerro Chulluncane into the Rio Yungane. It does so by crossing the mountains through the Huaylillas Norte tunnel. The Rio Yungane subsequently joins the Quebrada Vilavilani. The Quebrada Vilavilani descends the Andes in southwestward direction, where it has several different names, and ends close to the city of Tacna into the Caplina River. This canal was constructed in 1820. There were numerous projects to expand the canal system to more water sources in the Mauri, and the Canal Mauri was constructed in 1954. According to a report in 1977, the Canal Uchusuma is still used when the other canal is under maintenance. == References == === Sources === * Category:Irrigation canals Category:History of Peru ","title":"Canal Uchusuma"},{"id":"56702671","text":"right Vaccine (or sometimes vaksin) are rudimentary single-note trumpets found in Haiti and, to a lesser extent, the Dominican Republic as well as Jamaica. They consist of a simple tube, usually bamboo, with a mouthpiece at one end. They are thus also referred to as banbou or bamb√∫, as well as bois bourrique (or bwa bourik), granboe, fututo, or boom pipe. They are not to be confused with other Haitian handmade trumpets called kon√® or klewon, made of a yard- long white metal tube with a flared horn, called kata. Vaccine players are known as banbouly√®s. == Origins == Haitian ethnographer Jean Bernard traces the vaksin back to indigenous precolonial peoples of Haiti. However both Thompson and Holloway draw links to the single-note Bakongo bamboo trumpets called disoso, themselves originated in Mbuti hocketing music. Gillis also likens them to trumpets used in Bambara broto music along the Niger, and Jamaican Kumina. == Construction == Traditionally, vaccine are made of a length of bamboo, hollowed-out and dried, with a node membrane pierced and wrapped with leather or bicycle inner-tube rubber to form a mouthpiece at one end. One or more segments are taken from higher or lower in the bamboo trunk to fashion vaccines; usually more than 1m long and 5 to 7 cm in diameter. Each one is cut shorter or longer in order to produce a higher or lower tone: bas banbou is long and gives a low-pitched sound, and charlemagne banbou is short and is pitched high. McAlister explains that Afro-Hispaniolan lore involves asking the bamboo plant for its use and leaving a small payment in its place. Landies witnessed this process, which she described as follows: \\"the harvest of the bamboo was accompanied by an offering. [...] [It] is harvested with the permission of Simbi, a Petwo Lwa who loves water, as bamboo in the Dominican Republic grows in moist land, e.g., along rivers\\" On occasion, iron or plastic pipes are substituted for the bamboo. == Playing == A typical vaccine band is composed of three to five players, usually marching abreast of each other. Players use a method called hocketing, whereby each individual blows a single tone rhythmically to create an ostinato motif together. These motifs are usually composed through a process of group improvisation. To keep rhythm, vaccine players also beat a rhythmic timeline, called kata with a long stick on the side of the tube, making the instrument both melodic and percussive. == Tuning and scale == Within an ostinato, vaccine tones stack up in approximate third intervals to each other‚Äîcreating tritones and arpeggiated diminished chords, but without a harmonic intent‚Äîwith the two treble-most vaccines often tuned a semitone apart. Landies also reports other intervals between the lowest two voices. One of the vaccine serves as the tonal center of the motif. == Uses == Most importantly, vaccines are a key component of rara orchestras. In his 1941 article, Courlander wrote that rara bands \\"seldom have drums and depend almost entirely on vaccines\\"; though both Lomax's mid-1930s and McAllister's early 1990s studies report many more instruments‚Äîmostly percussive‚Äîas part of rara orchestras. Scholars also report vaccines used as signal horns by parties of agricultural workers, fishermen, stevedores as well as sometimes used in dances of the Congo cycle. == References == Category:Bamboo musical instruments Category:Haitian musical instruments ","title":"Vaccine (instrument)"},{"id":"56702676","text":"Tanya Talaga is an Anishinaabe Canadian journalist and author.

In July 2011 in conjunction with Our Generation, the organization issued a report on the salaries and fringe benefits earned by members of Congress entitled \\"Are taxpayers getting their money's worth?\\". In November of that year, the TPA was one of five taxpayer advocacy groups to sign a letter calling for a 10% reduction in pay for Congress members. In April 2012, the TPA and other groups called on Republican presidential candidate, Newt Gingrich, to relinquish his Secret Service protection. Gingrich lost his protection the following week. Over the course of 2013 and 2014, the organization issued reports on topics like the public costs of LEED certification, defense spending, and congressional salaries. The group also began levying criticism against municipal broadband projects using fiber optic cables for connectivity. In September 2015, the TPA issued a report called \\"Sacking Taxpayers: How NFL Stadium Subsidies Waste Money and Fall Short on Their Promises of Economic Development\\" which detailed the amount of money spent by taxpayers on publicly subsidized National Football League stadiums. Later that year, the organization issued a report (in conjunction with the Animal Justice Project) on the taxpayer costs associated with scientific experiments that administer narcotics to animals.

In 2017, the group started a social media campaign to oppose a proposed municipal broadband project in Louisville, Kentucky, claiming that the cost outweighed the benefits. In July 2018, TPA president David Williams wrote an open letter to the White House that was critical of the Trump administration's issuance of tariffs as part of the United States' ongoing trade war with China.

However, √âtienne Hubac begged the King that that name should be given to the ship (Foudroyant) he had just build and was then completing instead, because the previous Soleil Royal had been built by his own father, Laurent Hubac, and - as he himself had rebuilt that ship from the keel up at Brest in 1689 - he still possessed the moulds for that ship. Moreover, he pointed out to the King that his own ship would be some 4 feet longer and some 200 tons larger than Pangalo's new ship, so would be more deserving of the name that honoured Louis XIV himself. On 1 March 1693, the King agreed to Hubac's proposal and the names of the two ships were exchanged. Pangalo's ship was thus laid down under the name Foudroyant in April 1693, launched on 14 November 1693 and completed in 1694. She was armed with 104 guns, comprising twenty-eight 36-pounders on the lower deck, thirty 18-pounders on the middle deck, twenty-eight 12-pounders on the upper deck, twelve 6-pounders on the quarterdeck and six 6-pounders on the forecastle. In 1706 two extra 12-pounders were added on the upper deck, and two 6-pounders were removed. Royal Katherine The new ship took part in the Battle of V√©lez- M√°laga on 24 August 1704, where she was the flagship of Amiral de France Louis-Alexandre de Bourbon, Comte de Toulouse. She was scuttled in Toulon on Louis's orders in July 1707 to avoid being set alight by the bombardment by the English fleet. She was later put back afloat, but in March 1713 she was condemned, and was taken to pieces during 1714. ==References== * *Nomenclature des Vaisseaux du Roi-Soleil de 1661 a 1715.

She studied at the Southern Methodist University and Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile and received her M.F.A in printmaking at the Pratt Institute. Her work has been exhibited widely around the world, most recently her work was shown at the Galer√≠a Patricia Ready in Chile and the Art Basel Hong Kong. She is also part of various public collections such as the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C and the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes in Santiago, Chile. She was the recipient of the Premio de Gr√°fica at the Bienal internacional de Arte in Valparaiso, Chile and a fellowship for the Organization of American States in Washington, D.C. She currently lives and works in Santiago, Chile. == Early life and education == In 1972, Francisca Sutil studied at the School of Art in the Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas. In 1976, she graduated from in the Bellas Artes, Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile in Santiago. After attending Parson School of Design for a year, she did a seminar at the Whitney Museum of Art in New York. In 1981, she received an M.F.A in Printmaking at the Pratt institute in Brooklyn, New York. == Career and artwork == Francisca Sutil began her art career in the late 1970s making flat, paper cast work. Her strong interest in technical processes has led her work to evolve and change many times. She has worked in printmaking, papermaking and painting but her style and appreciation for meaning has remained constant throughout her career. Her well-crafted, abstract artwork reflects her love and understanding of process and materiality and alludes to high modernist abstraction and influences from artists like Jackson Pollock, Morris Louis and Ellsworth Kelly. At the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile, Sutil learned that she was more attracted to printmaking than painting. Sutil was always questioning her surroundings and her curiosity led her to engage in classical methods but approach them in unusual ways. Sutil would place flat objects one on top of the other to convey depth and light in her work. Her interest in printmaking induced her to conceive her series Evoluci√≥n, for which she worked with screen-printing using oil paint instead of ink. Using these non-traditional methods allowed her to explore the concepts of the mental and spiritual evolution of men. Sutil moved to New York in the late 70's to study printmaking at Pratt. It was there where she discovered papermaking and mastered the process. From the late 1970s to mid 1980s, Sutil was making sculptural abstract works out of cast paper. Her deep interest in printmaking and paper making has kept her close to all types of papers. For Sutil, paper acted not only as a surface for her work, but also as a structure that was part of her work. In 1986, Francisca Sutil began using oil pastels on her hand made paper, after two years she fully committed to painting with pigmented gesso but soon after, in the 90's, watercolor, Chinese ink and oils. Her series Space consisted of vertical lines on paper one after the other, the gesso did not have the correct consistency and did not work with this type of technique. In 2006, after an exhausting time in which she had to prepare for a big retrospective at the Bellas Artes Museum of Art and a monograph on her work, Francisca Sutil decided to take a year long trip to Europe in which she traveled all around the country absorbing the origins of Western Painting and Art of the XIII- XVIII centuries. After a year of traveling she decided to begin working with paint, this medium would allow her to examine her deep- seated questions about the relationship between materials. Her travels reflected on many of her following artworks such as Interludios. In these works, colors that she had never used appeared, the size was reduced and composition changed creating more intimate works that displayed all the knowledge she gained from her one-year abroad. For her next big series, Mute, Sutil marks a new phase in her career. Her new technique consists of loading a brush with ink or paint and placing it down on paper many times, this method creates an oval shaped mark that repeats continuously in lines going down the paper. Her new technique is reminiscent of \\"palotes\\", a technique used in schools to teach children how to write. Like \\"palotes\\", Sutil's oval shaped marks are placed one after the other, requiring time and concentration and creating all different final pieces. The colors she uses are mostly gray, black and white but in each work Sutil manages to make the colors stand out and look contrasted, conveying a chiaroscuro effect without the traditional methods and techniques. Many critics have thought about it as a metaphor for passing time, others see it as an act of prayer. == Awards == Francisca Sutil has been the recipient to various awards, fellowships and grants throughout her long career. Starting in 1972, she received a fellowship from the Southern Methodist university school of art in Dallas Texas. In 1976, she received a prize for the Drawing category from the Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile in Santiago. A year later, 1977, she received a graphic prize for the Bienal Internacional de Arte in Valparaiso, Chile. In 1980, she received a fellowship from the Organization of American States in Washington, D.C. In 1981, she received the NEA from the Drawing Center (Paper Conservation) in New York. she was awarded the EMF from the Artists Space in New York in 183 and in 1992 she received an award from the Fondo de Cultura y Desarolo de las Artes in Santiago Chile. Most recently she was awarded, in 2016, Best Exhibition of the Year for \\"The Will of Silence\\" by the Circle of Chilean Art Critics and in 2017, she received the Marco Bont√° Prize from the Academia Chilena de Bellas Artes in Chile. == Solo exhibitions == Francisca Sutil has had many one- person exhibitions, most recently she showed, \\"Alquimia/Alchemy\\" in 2006 in Santiago, Chile.

She was banished after it was discovered that she was sleeping with one of her ladies maids. ==Biography== Lady Bong was made Crown Princess Sun (;) in 1429, a few months after her predecessor, Crown Princess Hwi was thrown out of the palace for witchcraft.Veritable Records of Sejong, volume 46. The crown prince apparently did not favour her, which made her incredibly angry.Veritable Records of Sejong, volume 75. She reportedly took the crown prince's clothing and female clothing from the palace to send to her natal home, which breached etiquette. When Royal Consort Kwon became pregnant, Crown Princess Sun apparently complained to the palace women that she would be dismissed in favour of Kwon, and she frequently cried. Her complaints became known throughout the palace and the king reportedly scolded her that she should be happy that another concubine was pregnant when she was not. Sejong also scolded the crown prince that his concubine was pregnant but his official wife had no children, after which he spent more time with her. Later, Crown Princess Sun reportedly became pregnant but miscarried and buried the remains. However, when servants were sent to retrieve the child's remains, they found only empty burial clothes. ==Demotion== The court records of 1436 note that Crown Princess Sun apparently also sent surplus food from palace meals to her natal home, spied on people outside of her palace through a gap in the wall of the servant's toilet, and received a visit from her aunt's husband after her father's death without notifying the crown prince, which, they said, showed a lack of regard for the general good. The consort was also accused of being overintimate with So-ssang (ÏÜåÏåç), one of her maids and a member of the nobi slave class. The two were described as inseparable and So-ssang reportedly slept with her mistress. When the crown prince had questioned why her maid slept with her, the consort responded that she loved him, but he didn't love her. So-ssang later told the court how Crown Princess Sun had invited her to lie down with her, whilst the other maids slept outside. Though So-ssang initially declined, the consort insisted, and So-ssang eventually undressed and went behind the screen where her mistress took off her remaining clothes and forced her to lie next to her 'as if with a man'.Â¨™Áõ°Â•™È§òË°£, Âº∫‰ΩøÂÖ•Ëá•Áõ∏Êà≤, ÊúâÂ¶ÇÁî∑Â≠ê‰∫§ÂêàÁãÄ„ÄÇ Crown Princess Sun then told the court that she was intimate with So-ssang night and day, as well as with another servant called Dan-ji (Îã®ÏßÄ), because it solved the fact that she slept alone. Upon hearing that Crown Princess Sun had been initimate with a member of the nobi class, King Sejong consulted with various officials on demoting another of the crown prince's consorts. The officials supported the motion to demote her, and Crown Princess Sun was made a commoner and banished. The decree for her dismissal, however, excluded any mention of her sleeping with her maid and focussed instead on her sending palace supplies to her natal home and receiving visitors without her husband's knowledge. ==Popular culture== * Portrayed by Yeo Min-joo in the 2008 KBS2 TV series The Great King, Sejong ==References== ===Notes=== ===Works cited=== * Category:15th-century Korean people Category:1414 births Category:Year of death unknown Category:Royal consorts of the Joseon Dynasty Category:Medieval LGBT people Category:LGBT royalty Category:LGBT nobility Category:LGBT people from Korea Category:15th-century Korean women ","title":"Sun-bin Bong"},{"id":"56702957","text":"Mark Hamister is an American businessman and the Chairman and CEO of the Hamister Group.

Up to five cycles of deposition, each followed by shallowing of the sea, have been found. Each cycle begins with coarser material being laid down, and this was followed by clay which became increasingly sandy. These layers have been labelled A to E (with A being the oldest), and at Sheppey, the layers C to E are exposed on the cliffs and foreshore. Each layer has its own flora and fauna, with well- preserved fossils of invertebrates including bivalve and gastropod molluscs, brachiopods and nautiloids, as well as articulated lobsters and crabs, and sometimes insects. There is also a range of fossils of sharks, rays and bony fish, reptiles and birds. Some of the bones occur in nodules in the clay, and much material has been washed out onto the beach. Turtles, crocodiles and snakes are represented among the reptiles, and the birds include members of sixteen families. Sheppey cliffs are also a rich palaeobotany site.

The 83rd Cotton Bowl Classic was a College Football Playoff semifinal with the winner to compete in the 2019 College Football Playoff National Championship. It was one of the 2018‚Äì19 bowl games concluding the 2018 FBS football season. Sponsored by the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, the game was officially known as the College Football Playoff Semifinal at the Goodyear Cotton Bowl Classic. ==Teams== The game featured second-ranked Clemson of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) against third-ranked Notre Dame, an FBS independent. This was the first time that the two programs met in a bowl game; their more recent regular season meeting had been in 2015, won by Clemson. The only prior Cotton Bowl to feature two undefeated teams had been the 1948 edition, which ended in a 13‚Äì13 tie between Penn State and SMU. ===Clemson Tigers=== Clemson defeated Pitt in the 2018 ACC Championship Game on December 1, then received their bid to the Cotton Bowl with the release of final CFP rankings on December 2. The Tigers entered the bowl with a 13‚Äì0 record (8‚Äì0 in conference). On December 27, it was confirmed that three Clemson players, including starting defensive lineman Dexter Lawrence, would be suspended from playing in the game by the NCAA, due to drug testing showing \\"trace amounts of a banned substance\\", which was identified as ostarine. This was Clemson's second Cotton Bowl bid in school history, following its appearance in the 1940 edition. It was also the first Cotton Bowl appearance by an active ACC member since Maryland's appearance in the 1977 edition. ===Notre Dame Fighting Irish=== Notre Dame received their bid to the Cotton Bowl with the release of final CFP rankings on December 2. The independent Fighting Irish entered the bowl with a 12‚Äì0 record. This was Notre Dame's first Cotton Bowl berth since the 1994 edition and its eighth overall. ==Game summary== ===Scoring summary=== ===Statistics=== ==References== ==External links== * *Box score at ESPN Cotton Bowl Classic Category:2018‚Äì19 College Football Playoff Category:Cotton Bowl Classic Cotton Bowl Classic Category:21st century in Arlington, Texas Cotton Bowl Classic Category:Clemson Tigers football bowl games Category:Notre Dame Fighting Irish football bowl games ","title":"2018 Cotton Bowl Classic"},{"id":"56703138","text":"Bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide, sold under the brand name Biktarvy, is a fixed-dose combination medication for the treatment of HIV/AIDS. It contains 50mg bictegravir, 200mg emtricitabine, and 25mg tenofovir alafenamide. It was approved for use in the United States in February 2018, and for use in the European Union in June 2018. == Combination therapy == Bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide is an example of a combination drug that can be taken as a complete regimen for treatment of the human immunodeficiency virus. Combination therapy for HIV, often called highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), is composed of two or more types of antiretroviral drugs. Combination therapy decreases the likelihood that drug resistance will occur, because it is unlikely that the HIV-1 strains will be able to mutate enough to become resistant to all drugs being used in the combination. Combination therapy increases the length of lives of patients with HIV-1, and can greatly reduce the possibility for transmission of the virus. == Components == 2D chemical structure of bictegravir Bictegravir (BIC) is an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI). Bictegravir is different from other INSTIs because it contains a bridged bicyclic ring and a distinct benzyl tail with a 2,4,6-trifluorobenzyl group. This contributes to an increase in plasma protein binding and a reduction of activation of the pregnane X receptor (PXR). These changes minimize interactions between drugs, lower clearance, and increase solubility. Bictegravir was found to be less drug resistant than other drugs in the same class. 2D chemical structure of emtricitabine Emtricitabine (FTC) is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) that is a synthetic fluoro derivative of thiacytidine. Within the cell, emtricitabine becomes phosphorylated, which forms emitricitabine 5'-triphosphate within the cell. This allows for the drug to compete with the viral and host substrate and ultimately causes a termination of DNA chain elongation. Underlying hepatitis B virus (HBV) can interact with emtricitabine to cause significant liver damage, but it does not have a significant detrimental effect on the liver when given to patients without HBV. 2D chemical structure of tenofovir alafenamide Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) is a prodrug of tenofovir that functions as a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI). Other prodrugs for tenofovir have been tested, but TAF is more efficient at refining HIV-1 therapy. It converts intracellularly to TFV diphosphate, which is a metabolite in HIV target cells. Thus, TAF has higher active metabolite concentrations and lower plasma TFV than other Tenovir prodrugs. TAF is metabolized primarily with the kidneys, and has a lower dosage than other prodrugs, so it is less detrimental to the renal elimination system. == Medical uses == This drug regimen is intended and approved for adults with HIV-1 infection who have had no previous antiretroviral treatment or for those with less than 50 copies of HIV-1 RNA per mL. Patients with HIV-1 should not have previously had any adverse reactions or resistance to bictegravir, emtricitabine, or tenofovir alafenamide. == Side effects == This drug should not be co-administered with dofetilide or rifampin. Dofetilide when taken with bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide can cause an increase in dofetilide plasma concentrations, which can lead to death. Rifampin and bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide when taken together can decrease bictegravir plasma concentrations and cause resistance to bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide. Other HIV-1 antiretroviral drugs should not be taken with this therapy. If kidney disease or development of renal impairment is seen, the drug should be discontinued. Discontinuation of bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide in patients with hepatitis B and HIV-1 has been shown to increase the prevalence of hepatitis B, causing liver decompensation and liver failure. Adverse drug reactions include, but are not limited to, diarrhea, nausea, and headache. == References == == External links == * * * Category:Fixed dose combination (antiretroviral) ","title":"Bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide"},{"id":"56703168","text":"There is a community of Russians in Serbia (, ) numbering 3,247 people (2011 census).2011 Census of Population, Households and Dwellings in the Republic of Serbia POPULATION ETHNICITY According to 2013 data there were 3,290 Russian citizens in Serbia.–ú–∏–≥—Ä–∞—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–∏ –ø—Ä–æ—Ñ–∏–ª –†–µ–ø—É–±–ª–∏–∫–µ –°—Ä–±–∏—ò–µ –∑–∞ 2013. –≥–æ–¥–∏–Ω—É Church of the Holy Trinity in Belgrade Russian Center of Science and Culture in Belgrade ==Notable people== *Irina Antanasijeviƒá, philologist, Ukrainian- born *Tamara ƒåuroviƒá, tennis player, Russian mother *Dmitrij Gerasimenko, judoka, Russian-born *Olja Ivanjicki, painter, sculptor, poet *Nina Kirsanova, ballet artist *ƒêorƒëe Lobaƒçev, comic strip author and illustrator *Maria Manakova, chess player, Russian born *Nikolina and Olivera Moldovan, sprint canoers, Russian mother *Viktor Nikitin, pilot *George Ostrogorsky, historian and Byzantinist who acquired worldwide reputations in Byzantine studies *ƒêorƒëe Prudnikov, painter, graphic artist, and designer *Svetlana Prudnikova, chess player, Russian-born *Leonid ≈†ejka, painter and architect *Viktor Troicki, tennis player *Vladimir Volkov, football player *Arkady Vyatchanin, swimmer, Russian-born ==See also== *Russia-Serbia relations *Serbs in Russia ==References== ==Sources== *Raeff, M., 1990.

Genderqueer fashion aims to be perceived by consumers as a fashion style that focuses on experimenting garments based on people's different body shapes instead of following the restrictions given by gendered clothing categorization. == Genderqueer style == Genderqueer style is characterized by the choice to not conform to gender norms assigned at birth. Its purpose is to redefine what is considered feminine and masculine. This differentiation between gender norms through clothing became preponderant during the nineteenth century and it mainly involved different fabrics, trims and constructions for different genders.Y, Kawamura, Fashion-ology: an introduction to fashion studies, Bloomsbury Academy, 2015, p. 124 Those distinctions were meant to mirror gender roles in society as masculine clothing aimed to be practical while female fashion was perceived as purely aesthetic. Therefore, there is a historical dimension to the association between fashion and gender identity. Nonetheless, gender expression today is recognized by the LGBT community as a very personal and subjective behaviour; genderqueer style is therefore intrinsically tied to identity, and as such, it includes a vast range of aesthetics. According to contemporary criticism, gender becomes through fashion a form of body style which is a fundamental part of self-realisation and presentation as it creates a bridge between individual identity and society: the genderqueer fashion style tries to recode this relation, although encountering several restrictions in the mass production of commonly binary goods.B, Fine and E, Leopold, The World of Consumption, London: Routledge, 1993 These restrictions denote the political nature of genderqueer fashion. According to an article that featured the writer and activist Alok Vaid-Menon, fashion represents the inherent politics of each individual artist or human. For genderqueer people, as for transgender people, whose life and relationship with the body is hardly acknowledged by society, existence itself is political. Vaid-Menon points out that there is an additional layer of risk for humans assigned male at birth who want to present feminine by wearing dresses and makeup, since the act itself is likely to attract unwanted attention. In Vaid-Menon's words: \\"There's a material consequence to me presenting feminine, and there's not a material consequence to me presenting masculine, the minute I wear lipstick, or the minute I put on earrings, or the minute I'm wearing a skirt, my entire reality shifts\\". In this regard, a 2017 study from Davidson Skylar showed that non-binary people who were assigned male at birth encounter more negative employment outcomes than non-binary people who were assigned female at birth.S, Davidson, Gender Inequality: Nonbinary Transgender People in the Workplace, University of Massachusetts Amherst, 2016 This phenomenon is considered an aspect of transmisogyny. == Emerging designers == Most mainstream stores separate man and women clothing in different sections, making it difficult for genderqueer people to find clothes that fit. Genderqueer designers are trying to build a bridge between menswear and womenswear by meeting the clothing needs of all identities. For example, the clothing brand NO SESSO specializes in using different prints, fabric and reconstructed materials to dress various body types and gender identities. Sharpe Suiting is a fashion line that through a Kickstarter campaign was able to manufacture custom-constructed dresswear and a ready-to-wear line for a niche of masculine and androgynous people. Its innovative feature consists in developing a system of measuring and tailoring techniques that minimize female curves of people who don't identify as women. This method is called andropometrics and is an androgynous alternative to the standard anthropometrics method used by most manufacturers. Maternity lines often include stereotypically feminine elements both in shapes and patterns, as motherhood and femininity are commonly considered to be matching. An alternative was offered by the startup company butchbaby & co, the first wear line for pregnant genderqueer individuals. == Global retail brands == Non- conforming fashion styles are gaining acceptance by a larger audience; for this reason, brands such as Zara and H&M; are trying to offer unisex clothing lines to consumers by launching gender neutral collections. These collections are represented by female or male models only. Also, these unisex products display an aesthetic typically considered masculine, both in shapes and colours (grey, beige and brown). == High fashion modeling == Genderqueer fashion is being increasingly recognized by high fashion designers who are now showcasing it on their runaways. For example, during Moschino's Fall 2018 menswear and women's Pre-Fall show, Jeremy Scott presented a gender non- conforming look modelled by nonbinary model Oslo Grace and genderqueer drag queen Violet Chachki. In Violet Chachki's words: \\"It's very important to have visual representation, to show that queers are important, queers are powerful, queers are beautiful, queers are valid, and you can't erase us\\". Moreover, modeling agencies are starting to scout non-binary models. This is the case of My Friend Ned; a South African agency that officially divides its models in male, female and non-binary sections. Overall, genderqueer representation in the high fashion world appears to be growing and to be increasingly acknowledged by the media. Famous examples of genderqueer/non-binary models are Casey Legler, labelled as the world's first \\"female male model\\", Elliott Sailors, Rain Dove, Stas Fedyanin and Erika Linder. == See also == *Fashion == References == Category:Genderqueer Category:Fashion Category:Queer culture ","title":"Genderqueer fashion"},{"id":"56703427","text":" Perseverance was launched in Virginia in 1797 and was registered in Great Britain in 1799, A privateer captured her in 1800 but the British Royal Navy recaptured her within days.

The walls of the play area were stenciled in an Oriental motif with pagodas and willow trees.\\" Nell Smith changed the name of the now-22-room house to \\"Bide-A-Wee\\" (\\"Stay awhile\\") to honor her Scottish heritage, and she and her daughter created formal gardens on the property.Richard Holland, Whitehaven: Rebirth of a Southern Mansion (Kuttawa, KY: McClanahan Publishing House, 1989), 11-28. ==Decline== The last member of the Smith family moved out of the house in 1968, and it was left with caretakers who seem to have both abused the house and sold fixtures from it. After the caretakers themselves moved out in 1979, vandals broke every remaining pane of glass but one, and water damage rotted ceilings, floors, and portico. A portion of the east wall collapsed.Holland, 29-33; Nomination form. \\"[T]he house took on a ghostly, abandoned appearance reminiscent of a scene out of a William Faulkner novel.\\" ==Restoration== In 1981 the Smith family sold the 32-acre parcel to Paducah Junior College, which planned to use the property in expanding the college. The college did not want to demolish the house, but it did not have the money to restore it either. Later that year, Kentucky governor John Y. Brown Jr. and Kentucky Secretary of Transportation Frank Metts decided that the house could serve as the I-24 welcome center. There was opposition from other tourism-dependent counties, which wanted a modern welcome center nearer the interstate highway and the Ohio River and believed that restoring the mansion benefited Paducah and McCracken County at the expense of other, nearby tourist areas. \\"Smith Mansion plan is attractive,\\" Paducah Sun, April 12, 1982. The Whitehaven project was strongly supported by Edwin \\"Jack\\" Paxton (1939-1985), editor of the Paducah Sun. After a brief archaeological investigation, the house was carefully restored using as much original material as possible.Holland, 49-98. The kitchen wing was partially demolished and the remainder adapted to serve as a welcome center, with restrooms, information desk, and storage areas. Three outbuildings‚Äîthe gazebo, storm shelter, and carriage house‚Äîwere also saved and repurposed. Part of the second floor of the house was devoted to displaying memorabilia of Kentucky politician and US vice president Alben Barkley (1877-1956). The welcome center, renamed \\"Whitehaven,\\" was officially opened on June 23, 1983.Holland, 99-115, 131-33. ==References== Category:National Register of Historic Places in McCracken County, Kentucky Category:Buildings and structures in Paducah, Kentucky Category:Houses in McCracken County, Kentucky ","title":"Whitehaven (Paducah, Kentucky)"},{"id":"56703459","text":"The Erich-Weinert-Ensemble was a professional army ensemble of the National People's Army of the German Democratic Republic.

After the surrender of Hanover on June 29 these troops - including some small units of allies of Prussia - were grouped under the name Mainarmee (German for: Army of the Main) and pushed southward towards the river Main against the South-German allies of Austria. ==Course== The allies of Austria had formed the VIIth and VIIIth Federal Corps of the German Confederation. Both corps had advanced northward to support Hanover. When Hanover surprisingly surrendered the VIIth Corps, built by the Bavarians, stood in Thuringia. The VIIIth Corps, built by troops of Hesse, Baden and Wuerttemberg, stood north of Frankfurt. At first the Prussians attacked the VIIth Corps. The Bavarian troops lost combats at H√ºnfeld and Dermbach on 4 July and withdrew to the river Franconian Saale.Michael Embree: Too Little, Too Late: The Campaign in West and South Germany, June‚ÄìJuly 1866. Published by Helion & Company, Solihull, West Midlands, England, 2015, . pp. 68‚Äì88.

Embree pp. 89‚Äì124. Now the Bavarians retreated to W√ºrzburg while the Prussians turned westward against the VIIIth Corps which protected Frankfurt. The Prussians crossed the Spessart, defeated the Hessians at Laufach/Frohnhofen on 13 July and the Austrian and Hessian troops at Aschaffenburg on 14 July. The Federal troops had to withdraw westward to the left bank of the Main. After the Prussians had conquered Aschaffenburg and crossed the Main the way to Frankfurt and Darmstadt was open. Now the VIIIth Corps abandoned Frankfurt, moved south across the Odenwald and then turned eastward to meet the Bavarians at the river Tauber. The Prussians occupied the now undefended Frankfurt on 16 July and then followed the VIIIth Corps along the left bank of the Main.s. Fontane p. 155-200s.

Antheil p. 209-223s. Fontane p. 266-287 ==Reasons for the Prussian victory== The Prussian victory is more the result of better organization than of the technical superiority of the Prussian weapons like the needle gun (Z√ºndnadelgewehr).Dieter Storz: Die Bewaffnung. In: Dieter Storz, Daniel Hohrath (Ed.): Nord gegen S√ºd. Der Deutsche Krieg 1866. p. 47-51 Helmut von Moltke, the chief of the Prussian general staff, had planned an offensive war to beat the federal troops before they could unite and fully use their superiority in men and equipment. The plan was successful because the untrained federal armies needed a long time for mobilization which the Prussians had prepared well. Furthermore the Prussians had one unified command which the federal side had not. Formally Karl von Bayern, the commander of the VIIth corps, was supreme commander of all the federal troops, but Alexander von Hessen, the chief of the VIIIth corps, also received orders from the Federal Convention (Bundestag) in Frankfurt and the governments of the states which had sent troops. The communication between the federal troops was as insufficient as their reconnaissance so that they often had to react instead of acting initiatively.Dieter Storz: Der Feldzug. In: Dieter Storz, Daniel Hohrath (Ed.): Nord gegen S√ºd. Der Deutsche Krieg 1866. p. 57-59 ==Consequences== The German Confederation was abolished. Prussia annexed Hannover, Nassau, Hesse-Kassel and Frankfurt and small parts of Hesse- Darmstadt and Bavaria. Bavaria, W√ºrttemberg, Baden and Hesse-Darmstadt remained independent, but had to sign military alliances with Prussia. In Bavaria a fundamental army reform followed in 1868. == References == Category:Battles involving Bavaria Category:Battles involving Prussia Category:Battles of the Austro-Prussian War Category:Battles involving Austria Category:July 1866 events Category:1866 in Germany ","title":"Campaign of the Main"},{"id":"56703582","text":"Pin Drop Studio is an arts and entertainment studio founded in 2012 by Simon Oldfield and Elizabeth Day, with a particular focus on short fiction.

He worked as a newspaperman in Springfield, Ohio and was a special writer for the Cincinnati Enquirer. He also worked at various jobs including salesman, tan bark buyer, cowboy, and construction foreman. He was a prolific writer finishing over 40 novels and several short stories. He also wrote one screenplay. All of his work was in the western fiction genre. He set most of his books in Canada, Alaska, or Montana. His novels portrayed Canada as a relatively lawful and orderly place with reliable police and civilized court system. He compared this unfavorably to Alaska and Montana as relatively lawless places where criminals could find a safe haven. Many of his books were parts of series. He wrote a series of books based on Corporal Downey of the Northwest Mounted Police. Another series centred on Halfaday Creek and he wrote a series of juvenile books called the Connnie Morgan series.

A companion novel to Hartman's previous books Seraphina and Shadow Scale, the novel follows the story of Tess Dombegh, a younger sister of Seraphina. While some characters from the previous novels make appearances in the book, Tess of the Road is not a direct sequel to those novels, but is the start of a new duology. It was published by Random House on February 27, 2018. Tess of the Road was nominated for the 2018 Andre Norton Award and the 2018 Lodestar Award for Best Young Adult Book. ==Synopsis== The main character of the story Tess of the Road is Tess Dombegh. Tess is the younger sibling of Seraphina, the main character of the previous books by Rachel Hartman, along with her twin sister, Jeanne. She is (supposedly) the younger twin, and thus her role in life is to help her sister find a good husband and live a proper life. Tess is often the scapegoat of the family, and her mother often blames her for everything that goes wrong. Tess helped her sister arrange to marry Lord Richard Pfanzlig, and her sister invited her to stay with her as a nursemaid. The brother of Lord Richard, Brother Jacomo, hates Tess for reasons unbeknownst to her in the beginning, although it becomes clear that he hates her because he is a follower of St. Vitt, who damns premarital sex, and Tess had a bastard son. Tess's mother is also a follower of St. Vitt, and that is the reason she hates Tess so much. During Jeanne's wedding night, Tess got drunk and punched Brother Jacomo in the nose. She then was sent to live with Seraphina for a few days while they decided what to do with her. It is revealed at this time that Seraphina was pregnant. Seraphina hints that Tess should run away instead of joining the convent of St. Loola, which is what her mother wanted. Tess reluctantly runs away, and runs into her old friend Pathka. Pathka is a quigutl. He was a female quig when Tess first met him, but he changed his sex as he could likely no longer bear eggs. It is revealed that Tess saved his life, because when he was laying his egg, it got stuck, and she pulled it out. She then taught herself the Quigtul language, Quootla, and became friends with Pathka. Tess decides to pose as a man to be afforded more freedom during her journey, and adopts Jacomo's name as a way to gain favor with people. She walks with Pathka, and they try to find a world serpent, which are deities that the Quig worship. They make many stops along the way to Anathusia, one of the world serpents. She faces trials both inner and outer, and makes many friends. In the end, she just keeps walking. ==Background== ==Reception== Tess of the Road has been received positively by critics, and has been awarded four starred reviews. Booklist commented \\"First in a duology, this is a perfect example of a familiar fantasy trope being given new dimension through empathetic characters and exquisite storytelling. At first appearing bitter and self- pitying, Tess reveals compassion, courage, and resilience on her journey, which is as emotional and spiritual as it is physical.\\" Kirkus Reviews said \\"Angry, bitter Tess has reason for her feelings but is not always easy to walk with, and the slow reveal of her past makes for a compelling read on the ways in which girls‚Äîin the quasi-Renaissance Goredd and also in the real world‚Äîare taught to take blame on themselves even when others are culpable. Fortunately, the Road has answers (\\"walk on\\"), and by the end Tess has faced her past and can look forward to another volume of adventure, discovery, and changing her world.\\" Bulletin's review states that \\"her story is also a rousing adventure set in a richly drawn world, and the novel‚Äôs conclusion sets up a sequel that promises to have every bit as much excitement, and a healthy dose of political intrigue as well. Newcomers to Hartman‚Äôs work will be every bit as enthralled as her fans with this companion novel to Seraphina (BCCB 9/12) and Shadow Scale.\\" Shelf Awareness writes \\"Fully human Tess's life has been constrained by shame and the medieval expectations of others. Her growing awareness of the inequality and unfairness she has been subjected to, along with an unfolding sense of herself and her potential, will captivate any reader.

Shri Chaitu Lal (Rajeev Nigam) is Chief Minister of a fictional state named Ulta Pradesh. This Chief Minister is known for fooling the innocent citizens by making false promises. Like any other neta Chaitu is a fairly manipulative, wise with words and is of an opportunistic kind. His 'thenga party' vouches only for black money by manipulating the system. He promises what benefits the common man but does what benefits him. Supporting him in this comedy show is his wife Imli Devi (Samta Sagar). She stands by her husband through the thick and thin. Even though Chaitu is the leader of the ruling party when it comes to home, his wife is his biggest support system. Imli hopes to see her brother and CM's enthusiastic brother-in-law, Putan (Ishtiyak Khan) as the Prime Minister of the nation. Putan a youth icon of his state is as shrewd as his Jijaji.

The Cossacks then proceeded to punish more locals; peasants were put to forced labour, two men were killed by whip lashing, women were mistreated, and cattle was worked to death. The people of the Aragvi valley then attacked the troops of , killing several of them. They then proceeded to occupy several of the forts on the nearby main road.

Despite his attempts to distance himself from the group, Iori gets quickly swept up in their antics, while his cousins try to show him the wonders of diving into the ocean and sea. ==Characters== ; : :Played by: Ryo Ryusei (live-action film) :Iori is a first year Mechanical Engineering student at Izu University who has never learned to swim, despite being part of the diving club. Though he initially tries to live a normal life, Iori quickly gets pulled into the \\"Peek a Boo\\" Diving Club's activities that often end with drunk, naked revelry. He often acts aloof and perverted but he treasures his relationships to the point he will repress his worse traits when necessary. Although his father was adopted by the Kotegawas, he sees Chisa and Nanaka as family. Iori's open, earnest nature wins over several characters he encounters throughout the story although his childish tendencies lead him into conflict with said individuals. In the past he enjoyed writing songs and dreamed of creating a band, memories he finds embarrassing due to his previous dearth of skill and saccharine sentiment. Iori is skilled at playing tennis, volleyball, and almost any other sport that involve precise aim. He has a neurotic habit of overthinking straightforward problems with over-the-top, wild speculations. ; : :Played by: Y≈´ki Yoda (live-action film) :Iori's cousin and classmate at Izu University, Chisa is a smart and attractive girl with a passion for diving. Compared to the other members in the Peek a Boo club, Chisa is portrayed as the most \\"normal\\". She is level-headed, reserved, and rarely partakes in drunken shenanigans. She is uninterested in romance. To her chagrin, she is forced to fend off regular attempts by other university students to hit on her thanks to her beauty. Chisa's main ambition is to become a dive instructor like her mother and to that end, she immerses herself in diving culture over anything else. She isn't above using others to preserve her solitude, including feigning a relationship with Iori to drive off suitors and punish him for going out of his way to help Aina instead of her during the beauty contest. Her relationship with Iori vacillates between tenderness over a shared love of diving and cold disgust at his immaturity. As a result of a chilly relationship with her mother Chisa is unused to openly expressing her feelings. In emotional scenarios she tends to get flustered and lose her composure. ; : :Played by: Masahiro Takashima (live-action film) :The owner of the diving shop Grand Blue and Iori's uncle, as well as father of Chisa and Nanaka. ; : :Played by: Aya Asahina (live-action film) :A voluptuous woman and diving instructor at Grand Blue who mostly observes the diving club's antics. She is the least involved with PAB's drinking parties, and the members have admitted that they are more reserved in stripping and drinking when she is there. She is secretly infatuated with Chisa, despite being her sister, but she has admitted she would support Iori if he promised to make Chisa happy. Ironically Nanaka is uncomfortable or clueless about most things sexual, leading her to stumble into perverted situations with Iori and Azusa. She possesses frightening strength that manifests whenever she sees a possible threat to her relationship with Chisa. ; : :Played by: Atsuhiro Inukai (live- action film) :Iori's best friend, with whom he has a friendly rivalry. K≈çhei is a hardcore otaku who often wears shirts with his favorite anime girl character on them. He came to the university to chase his impossible dream of running a harem of cute high-school girls and ends up getting roped into Peek a Boo. Many of K≈çhei's comedic antics are drawn from his obsession with anime culture and subsequent detachment from reality. He is often clueless in reading social situations or conflates their dynamics with parallels from his favorite shows. One running gag is how easily he is manipulated by other Peek a Boo members through his love of famous female voice actors; in particular, his admiration of Kaya Mizuki becomes a relevant plot point in multiple arcs. In rarer circumstances he showcases remarkable resilience, strength, and astuteness when his anime-related interests are threatened. At first glance, K≈çhei's relationship with Iori is defined by slapstick violence and rancor over petty, trivial disagreements, but he cares for his friend's well-being and is dependable when it really counts. It's subtly implied he comes from a wealthy background. ; : :Played by: Suzunosuke Tanaka (live-action film) :A senior student at Izu and member of Peek a Boo who often gets himself and other club members drunk and naked, Tokita is a muscular, laid-back college student who loves to party. However, just like the other members of PAB, he sincerely loves diving and takes the possible dangers seriously. To Iori's surprise, he has a girlfriend. ; : :Played by: Hiroaki Iwanaga (live-action film) :A senior student at Izu and member of Peek a Boo who often gets himself and other club members drunk and naked. Kotobuki is just like Tokita both in appearance and in personality when they are partying, but Kotobuki can be surprisingly charismatic. He works as a professional bartender part-time. ; : :Played by: Yuka Ogura (live-action film) :A senior student from Oumi Women's College and member of Peek a Boo who often parties with the other senior members, despite being one of the few women in the club. She is portrayed with an unwittingly sensual and seductive demeanor that leads her younger contemporaries to assume she's sexually experienced. However her promiscuity is largely limited to an erotic obsession with Nanaka, which is played up for laughs. She has an unrequited crush on Tokita but believes pursuing it would damage the dynamics of the senior Peek a Boo group. Azusa is extremely lax about her appearance and often catches people off-guard by stripping without a second thought. She initially grows close to Iori after mistakenly concluding he's bisexual, seeking him as a possible confidant with whom she can discuss her own bisexuality. Azusa has a generous spirit and acute perception that compels her to help other Peek a Boo members with their personal troubles. This is mixed with a mischievous streak that ends up complicating matters in humorous ways. ; : :Played by: Ren Ishikawa (live-action film) :A freshman from Oumi Women's College and a former member of the Tennis Club \\"Tinkerbell.\\" Nicknamed \\"Cakey\\" due to the large amount of makeup she used to put on her face in an attempt to be more popular with guys, Aina later joins Peek a Boo after Iori and K≈çhei stand up for her. Although she initially asks out K≈çhei, she develops persistent romantic feelings for Iori after he humiliates Captain Kud≈ç to avenge her bullying at the hands of Tinkerbell. Without her makeup on Aina is much more mild-mannered and bashful, and often plays the tsukkomi role to the crazy antics around her. She is the only one in the group who cannot cook well, and is the clumsiest of them all. She grew up on a farm and as a result, is quite skilled at manual labor including driving stick shift. Her country background makes her self-conscious about her rural accent, which she occasionally slips into whenever nervous, and enamored of activities she associates with glamorous city life.
