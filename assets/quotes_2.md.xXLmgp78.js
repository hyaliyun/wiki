Western Electric Co., 304 U.S. 175 (1938), was a case that the Supreme Court of the United States decided in 1938. The decision upheld so-called field-of-use limitations in patent licenses: it held that the limitations were enforceable in a patent infringement suit in federal court against the licensee and those acting in concert with it‚Äîfor example, a customer that knowingly buys a patented product from the licensee that is outside the scope of the license., affirmed on rehearing, . A field-of-use limitation is a provision in a patent license that limits the scope of what the patent owner authorizes a manufacturing licensee (that is, a licensee that manufactures a patented product or performs a patented process) to use the patent to make a specified product or do specified things. The license specifies a defined field of permissible operation or specifies fields from which the licensee is excluded. By way of example, such a license might authorize a licensee to manufacture patented engines only for incorporation into trucks, or to manufacture such engines only for sale to farmers, or only engines rated from 100 to 200 horsepower. More generally, this kind of license permits the licensee to use the patented invention in some, but not all, possible ways in which the invention could be exploited. In an exclusive field-of-use license the licensee is the only person authorized to use the invention in the field of the license.See generally Herbert Hovenkamp, Post- Sale Restraints and Competitive Harm: The First Sale Doctrine In Perspective, 66 NYU 487, 496 (2011). The General Talking Pictures doctrine does not apply to all cases in which a patent owner imposes a restriction on what may subsequently be done with the patented product. When the patent owner sells a patented product to a customer, for example, the exhaustion doctrine applies instead and the patent no longer operates to limit what the customer does with the product or in what field the customer uses it.Hovenkamp. ==Factual background== AT&T; owned patents on vacuum tubes (which the majority opinion termed ‚Äúamplifiers‚Äù) and licensed the patents to Transformer Company to manufacture tubes for use in the field of home radios, or small, so-called noncommercial amplifiers. AT&T; licensed other companies (its subsidiaries) in the field of so-called commercial use, or large amplifiers for use in theaters. The vacuum tubes used in the different fields were indistinguishable. Transformer Company sold its products to General Talking Pictures (GTP), which knew of the field-of-use limitation but (like Transformer Company) ignored it. AT&T; sued GTP and Transformer Company. ==Supreme Court decisionMajority opinion=== The majority upheld the arrangement as a well-known, legitimate expedient: ‚ÄúPatent owners may grant licenses extending to all uses or limited to use in a defined field.‚Äù The Transformer Company was only a nonexclusive licensee in a limited field, as it and General Talking Pictures knew. The Transformer Company had no rights outside its licensed field, and thus ‚Äúcould not convey to petitioner [General Talking Pictures] what both knew it was not authorized to sell.‚Äù The majority paid no attention to whether the so-called amplifiers were actually interchangeable shelf-item components of amplifying systems, a point that Justice Black emphasized in his dissent.It was also unmentioned that in Adams v. Burke the patentee Adams assigned the rights to manufacture, sell, and use the patented products in Boston and a ten-mile radius around it to Lockhart & Seelye, who manufactured them and sold them to Burke, who took them more than ten miles from Boston and used them in his business. See Adams v. Burks, 1 Fed. Cas. 100 (Case No. 50) (C.C.D. Mass. 1871). When Adams sued Burke for patent infringement the Supreme Court held that Burke was not liable because of the exhaustion doctrine. 84 U.S. (17 Wall.) 453 (1873). ===Dissenting opinion=== Justice Black dissented. As he perceived it, and considered of great importance, the tubes that all licensees made were fungible, interchangeable articles of commerce, which the Transformer Company was authorized to manufacture. Once they left the manufacturing licensee's hands, who sold them to General Talking Pictures, they passed outside the patent monopoly: > The patent statute which permits a patentee to ‚Äúmake, use and vend‚Äù confers > no power to fix and restrict the uses to which a merchantable commodity can > be put after it has been bought in the open market from one who was granted > authority to manufacture and sell it. Neither the right to make, nor the > right to use, nor the right to sell a chattel, includes the right ‚Ä¶to > control the use of the same chattel by another who has purchased it. A > license to sell a widely used merchantable chattel must be as to prospective > purchasers‚Ä¶a transfer of the patentee's entire right to sell; it cannot ‚Äî as > to noncontracting parties ‚Äî restrict the use of ordinary articles of > purchase bought in the open market. ==Impact== The General Talking Pictures doctrine remains valid law, subject to possible antitrust exceptions (see below). The exhaustion doctrine does not operate to free from the patent monopoly product sales that a limited licensee makes to one who seeks to use the sold product outside the licensed field ‚Äî at least when the buyer has notice of the limitation. Nonetheless, tension exists between the two doctrines ‚Äî particularly when the field-of-use license is not as explicit as it might be. Then, as illustrated by the recent Supreme Court decision in Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc.,. ‚Äúdefault‚Äù rules take over. The default rules, which apply when a court interprets a license or other contract as ambiguous or not complete, are that the exhaustion doctrine governs over the General Talking Pictures doctrine in ambiguous cases. A use restriction in a license must be explicit to bind a seller, if it is to do so at all. Furthermore, the default rule for licenses to manufacture a patented product is that the license is unlimited, i.e., it covers all possible fields. Thus, a manufacturing license is unlimited unless its language explicitly provides otherwise. Because the contractual documents in the Quanta case were insufficiently explicit, or so the Supreme Court seemed to believe, the Court applied the exhaustion doctrine rather than the General Talking Pictures doctrine. Therefore, purchasers of the patented product were free to use them without restrictions that the patentee sought to have imposed on them. ==Antitrust exception== In some circumstances, field-of-use arrangements (particularly those of patent pools) may violate the antitrust laws. A set of field-of-use licenses may be used to allocate markets among competing manufacturers of a product with attendant price manipulation. Thus, in Hartford-Empire Co. v. United States,. the courts condemned a cartel among bottle manufacturers that operated by parceling out different markets to different members of the cartel. The members were given limited licenses in the respective markets allocated to them. This was held to violate the antitrust laws. In Ethyl Gasoline Corp. v. United States,. the defendant Ethyl had established an elaborate licensing program under its several patents on a fuel additive tetra-ethyl lead, a motor fuel containing tetra-ethyl lead, and a method of operating an automobile engine with fuel containing tetra-ethyl lead. Ethyl sold the fuel additive, and licensed purchasers to use it to practice the other patents. The licensing program fixed prices for the motor fuel and strictly limited the types of customer to which given licensees could sell the motor fuel. Ethyl emphasized to the Supreme Court the fact that while it sold the fuel subject to a post-sale restraint it licensed the other patents, which covered the manufacture of the fuel (by adding tetra-ethyl lead to ordinary gasoline) and the use of the fuel in automobile engines. Ethyl argued that the licensed patents and the manufacturing brought the case within the shelter of the General Talking Pictures doctrine. The Supreme Court refused to make any distinctions among the different patents and struck the whole program down for improperly ‚Äúregimenting‚Äù the industry in violation of the antitrust laws. ==ReferencesCategory:United States patent case law Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Hughes Court Category:1938 in United States case law Category:Bell System ","title":"General Talking Pictures Corp. v.

Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron 11 (HSC-11), also known as the Dragonslayers, is a United States Navy helicopter squadron based at Naval Air Station Norfolk as part of Carrier Air Wing 1 operating MH-60S helicopters deployed aboard aircraft carriers. The squadron was established on 27 June 1957 at Naval Air Station Quonset Point as Helicopter Anti-Submarine Squadron 11 (HS-11) with Sikorsky HSS-1 Seabat helicopters. In 2016, HS-11 transitioned to MH-60S and re-designated as HSC-11. ==History== Helicopter Anti-Submarine Squadron 11 was established on 27 June 1957 at Naval Air Station (NAS) Quonset Point, Rhode Island. The squadron's nickname was the Sub Seekers and it first flew the Sikorsky HSS-1 Seabat helicopter under the radio call sign ‚ÄúSnowbound‚Äù. The primary mission of the Seabat was antisubmarine warfare (ASW) and it carried dipping sonar. In 1959 the squadron transitioned to the HSS-1N Seabat which was upgraded with Doppler radar and automatic stabilization and hover capabilities for all-weather operations. The HS-11 Sub Seekers were assigned to Carrier Anti-Submarine Air Group 52 (CVSG-52) with tail code AS and deployed on board . In September 1962 the squadron's HSS-1N helicopters were re-designated the SH-34J Seabat in compliance with the 1962 United States Tri-Service aircraft designation system. At the end of 1962, the squadron transitioned to the Sikorsky twin engine SH-3A Sea King and would later upgrade to the SH-3D and SH-3H in 1969 and 1980, respectively. In December 1969, HS-11 became the first ASW helicopter squadron to deploy as part of a modern carrier air wing with CVW-17 on board . From 1970 to 1973, HS-11 was assigned to CVSG-56 deploying on board with tail code AU. On 17 October 1973, HS-11 moved to its new home port of Naval Air Station Jacksonville and was reassigned to Carrier Air Wing ONE (CVW-1) where it remains assigned to this day. In 1989, HS-11 changed its squadron nickname from Sub Seekers to Dragonslayers. HS-11 would make deployments on board , , , , and aboard before Enterprise decommissioned late in 2012. The Dragonslayer history has many distinguished highlights. The squadron played a leading role in astronaut recovery operations during the Gemini missions, plucking from the sea such famed astronauts as White, McDivitt, Lovell, and Aldrin. In 1976, the squadron was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation for saving countless lives after ship collisions at sea while attached to . Over the years, HS-11 has answered the domestic call for help numerous times in support of hurricane relief efforts, including Hurricane Andrew in 1993 and in 1999 the squadron rescued nine men whose ship was sunk during Hurricane Floyd in winds over 50 knots and seas measuring 30 feet. HS-11 was the first Navy squadron on-station just hours after Hurricane Ike swept through Galveston, Texas, in September 2008. More recently, HS-11 was one of the first units to respond to the earthquake as part of Operation unified response in Haiti in January 2010. Since 1985, HS-11 has participated in Operation Ocean Safari in the northern Atlantic, Operation Prairie Fire in Libya, Operations Desert Shield, Desert Storm and Southern Watch in the Persian Gulf, Operation Provide Promise in the Adriatic Sea, Operation Provide Comfort off Mogadishu, Somalia and Operations Deny Flight and Decisive Edge in the Adriatic Sea. Most recently, HS-11 participated in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and Operation Iraqi Freedom between 2001 and 2003, and again supported Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom in 2006 and 2007. In 2006, the Dragonslayers deployed two HH-60H aircraft to Basrah, Iraq, in support of Multi-National Division (South-East) and the Joint Helicopter Force.Public.Navy.mil - HS-11 In 1994, HS-11 transitioned to the Sikorsky SH-60F and HH-60H Seahawk helicopters. The capabilities of those aircraft allowed the squadron to greatly expand its mission areas. In addition to ASW and search and rescue, the Dragonslayers added such missions as Vertical Replenishment, Naval Special Warfare Support, and Combat Search and Rescue to its capabilities. With the addition of the Hellfire missile system and GAU-16 .50 caliber machine gun in 1999, HS-11 became capable of effectively conducting anti-surface warfare. In 2014 HS-11 became the first active duty fleet helicopter squadron to deploy with the GAU-17/A 7.62mm mini-gun system. On 1 June 2016, HS-11 completed transition to the MH-60S Seahawk, was redesignated HSC-11, and moved from NAS Jacksonville to Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia. ==See also== * List of United States Navy aircraft squadrons ==External links== * ==References== Category:Helicopter sea combat squadrons of the United States Navy Category:1957 establishments in Virginia ","title":"Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron 11 (United States Navy)"},{"id":"20191189","text":"Welcome to Old Town sign, corner of Old Town Road and North Railroad Avenue Old Town is a neighborhood in the New York City borough of Staten Island, located on its East Shore.

Bass (DE-691/APD-124/LPR-124) was a United States Navy high-speed transport in commission from 1944 to 1969. ==Construction and commissioning== Originally projected as a Rudderow-class destroyer escort (DE-691), Horace A. Bass (APD-124) was selected for completion to a modified design as a Crosley Class High-speed Transport (APD), designed for landing and supporting raiding parties while retaining a secondary, destroyer escort-like role of convoy escort.Conway's All the Worlds Fighting Ships 1922-1946, p. 161 Laid down on 3 August 1944 at Quincy, Massachusetts, by the Bethlehem Steel Company, Fore River, she was launched on 12 September 1944, sponsored by Mrs. Horace A. Bass Jr., widow of Ensign Horace A. Bass Jr., and commissioned on 21 December 1944, Lieutenant Commander F. W. Kuhn in command. ==World War II service 1944-1945== Horace A. Bass fitted out at the Boston Navy Yard, Boston, Massachusetts, and conducted shakedown training off Bermuda, after which she sailed to New York City, where she arrived 15 February 1945. Departing on 16 February 1945, Horace A. Bass escorted ammunition ship USS Firedrake (AE-14) to Panama, from where she proceeded to San Diego, California, arriving on 3 March 1945. After gunnery exercises in the area she sailed westward to join in the climactic phase of World War II. Horace A. Bass stopped at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii; Eniwetok; and Ulithi Atoll, en route Okinawa, where the largest fleet assembled in the Pacific was supporting United States Army and United States Marine Corps forces in what was to be the final major land battle of the war against Japan. She arrived off Okinawa on 6 April 1945, just in time to take part in repelling one of the fiercest Japanese air assaults of the campaign. As the desperate attack was driven off, Horace A. Bass was credited with at least one plane shot down. As the battle raged ashore, she served on the vital picket line to warn of incoming Japanese air raids until 10 April 1945, when she sailed with a convoy to Guam. On the return passage she sank the Japanese submarine RO-109 with a single accurate depth charge attack south of Okinawa on 25 April 1945. Arriving at Okinawa on 26 April 1945, Horace A. Bass resumed the hectic picket duty interspersed with convoy voyages to Saipan and Guam. Though Okinawa was secured in mid-June 1945, Japanese air attacks continued, and Horace A. Bass continued to provide antiaircraft and antisubmarine protection to the many ships off Okinawa. Early on 30 July 1945, she was on picket duty in the area when a low-flying kamikaze suicide aircraft crashed through her superstructure and fell alongside, its bomb exploding close aboard. Horace A. Bass suffered hull damage and 14 casualties, but was quickly repaired. She remained off Okinawa until sailing north toward Japan on 14 August 1945. Horace A. Bass received two battle stars for World War II service, for: *Okinawa Gunto Operation: Assault and Occupation of Okinawa Gunto 6 April 1945 to 10 April 1945 and 25 April 1945 to 30 June 1945 *Third Fleet Operations Against Japan 10 July 1945 to 15 August 1945 ==Peacetime service, 1945-1950== Horace A. Bass alongside Japanese battleship Nagato immediately after World War II.After the end of hostilities with Japan on 15 August 1945, Horace A. Bass remained off Japan with United States Third Fleet units until the ships triumphantly entered Tokyo Bay on 27 August 1945. Horace A. Bass took part in 'the occupation of the giant Yokosuka Naval Base, furnishing the prize crew which took possession of battleship Nagato, one of the very few major ships left to the Imperial Japanese Navy. Horace A. Bass remained at Yokosuka assisting in the occupation until sailing for the United States on 14 January 1946. Horace A. Bass arrived at San Francisco, California, on 7 February 1946. She was in overhaul at the Mare Island Navy Yard, Vallejo, California, from 11 February 1946 to 10 April 1946, then spent the remainder of 1946 in the San Diego area on training operations. She sailed again for the Far East on 27 January 1947, this time to support American efforts to stabilize the volatile situation in China due to the civil war there. Arriving at Tsingtao, China, on 5 March 1947, Horace A. Bass acted as a station ship until sailing again for San Diego on 30 July 1947. She spent the second half of 1947 on training exercises in California waters, and in early 1948 she operated off the coast of Mexico. She proceeded to China again on 16 June 1948, and again served as station ship at Hong Kong and Tsingtao, occasionally sailing to the Marshall Islands and Guam. As communist troops began to gain the upper hand in the Chinese Civil War, Horace A. Bass evacuated civilians of several nations from Nanking in November 1948. She departed China on 1 December 1948, arriving at San Diego on 21 December 1948 for repairs and training. After exercises off San Diego and a large amphibious warfare training assault in Hawaii, Horace A. Bass' sailed from Hawaii on 14 November 1949 for another tour of duty in China. Arriving at Hong Kong on 30 November 1949, she remained in waters off China and Southeast Asian countries to protect American interests in the area, arriving at San Diego on 12 June 1950. ==Korean War service 1950-1953== With the outbreak of the Korean War on 25 June 1950, American naval power moved swiftly into the Far East to support land operations. Horace A. Bass sailed on 14 July 1950 to join the fleet units already deployed off Korea, arriving 2 August 1950 with troops of the 2nd Marine Division. Underwater Demolition Teams and Marine Reconnaissance units were assigned to her, and she moved to the eastern coast of North Korea to carry out raids on Communist supply lines. Between 11 August 1950 and 17 August 1950 she made three successful raids, destroying three tunnels and two bridges. Horace A. Bass also conducted shore bombardments during daylight hours. As United Nations forces prepared to go on the offensive, Horace A. Bass played an important part in the planning for the upcoming Inchon operation. Her raiding parties reconnoitered possible landing beaches between 20 August 1950 and 25 August 1950, and departed Pusan on 12 September 1950 for the main Inchon assault. Horace A. Bass put her troops ashore in the first wave on 15 September 1950, as the extremely successful amphibious operation suddenly reversed the course of the war. As United Nations troops pushed northward, Howard A. Bass resumed her raiding duties, making two attacks on tunnels and bridges near Songjin between 6 October 1950 and 8 October 1950. For this operation Horace A. Bass carried Royal Marine Commandos. Late in October 1950 she took part in operations to clear the port of Wonsan for another landing, assisting minesweeping groups. She then spent three months on beach survey duty before sailing for the United States on 28 January 1951. For this highly successful tour of duty, Horace A. Bass and her special operations group received the Navy Unit Commendation. Horace A. Bass steamed toward Korea again on 24 September 1951, and after stopping at Yokosuka resumed bombardment and raiding duties along the coast of North Korea. In 14 separate raids with American, British, and Republic of Korea landing parties, Horace A. Bass did much to interrupt the all-important supply lines from the north, which proved vulnerable to mobile forces afloat. She completed her second tour of duty in Korea on 3 July 1952, when she sailed from Yokosuka. She arrived at San Diego on 20 July 1952. Horace A. Bass spent the next year in operations off the California coast, but sailed on 15 July 1953 for her third tour of Korean duty. The Korean War ended later that month while she was en route. Horace A. Bass received six battle stars in addition to her Navy Unit Commendation for Korean War service. The battle stars were for: *North Korean Aggression 8 September 1950 to 2 November 1950 *Communist China Aggression 4 November 1950 to 23 January 1951 *Inchon Landing 13 September 1950 to 16 September 1950 *United Nations Summer-Fall Offensive 27 November 1951 *Second Korean Winter 28 November 1951 to 5 December 1951, 7 December 1951 to 22 December 1951, 9 January 1952 to 13 January 1952, 20 January 1952 to 25 January 1952, 1 February 1952 to 4 February 1952, 29 February 1952 to 30 March 1952,USS Horace A.

Bass became flagship of an amphibious control squadron, and took part in various training landings in Japan. She also conducted three survey operations and two demolition assignments on the Korean coast, where the armistice was now in effect. She visited other Pacific ports during this period before departing Yokosuka on 5 April 1954. She operated off the United States West Coast on training cruises and antisubmarine exercises until getting underway for the Far East again on 23 October 1954. She carried on practice landings in South Korea and took part in fleet exercises until February 1955, when she moved to the Taiwan Strait to evacuate Nationalist Chinese troops from the Tachen Islands. With this important Cold War operation over, Horace A. Bass steamed to Haiphong, French Indochina, on 26 February 1955 to take part in Operation Passage to Freedom, as thousands of Vietnamese from the north fled the advance of Communist forces. The transporting of these civilians to the south was completed on 20 March 1955, and Horace A. Bass was underway from Sasebo, Japan, on 4 April 1955, bound for San Diego. After her arrival Horace A. Bass was transferred to the United States Atlantic Fleet, transiting the Panama Canal between 2 June 1955 and 4 June 1955 and arriving at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on 10 June 1955. She was then assigned to the 4th Naval District as a United States Naval Reserve training ship. During the years that followed, Horace A. Bass made short cruises with naval reservists to Caribbean ports, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland, helping to maintain the skills of hundreds of reserve officers and men. Horace A. Bass arrived at Orange, Texas, on 3 November 1958, and decommissioned there on 9 February 1959. She entered the Atlantic Reserve Fleet at Orange. She was recommissioned at an unrecorded date. She was redesignated as an \\"amphibious transport, small\\" and LPR-124 on 1 January 1969. ==Decommissioning and disposal== Horace A. Bass was decommissioned on 30 July 1969 and stricken from the Naval Register on 15 September 1974. She was sold for scrapping on 11 August 1975 to J. R. Steel, Inc. of Houston, Texas, for $79,002 (USD). ==NotesReferences== * *USS Horace A. Bass (LPR-124) ex USS Horace A. Bass (APD-124) (1944 - 1968) *Chesneau, Roger, Ed.

The team was formed by pharmaceutical executive Ewing Kauffman as a result of the move of the Athletics to Oakland,Kansas City Royals (1969-Present) and began play in 1969. They became competitive more quickly than most expansion teams in Major League Baseball, achieving a winning record in their third season. By 1976, the young team was becoming the dominant force in the AL West, winning 90 or more games in four consecutive seasons from 1975 to 1978 and twice being denied a World Series berth in the ninth inning by the Yankees. Despite two lapses to below 80 wins, the Royals remained a force in baseball for a decade, reaching the 1980 World Series and winning in 1985 against cross-state rivals the St. Louis Cardinals, becoming the only team to ever rally from a three games to one deficit twice in the same postseason to win the World Series. The team remained competitive throughout the mid-1990s, but then had only one winning season from 1995 to 2012. For 28 consecutive seasons, between the 1985 World Series championship and 2014, the Royals did not qualify to play in the Major League Baseball postseason, one of the longest postseason droughts during baseball's current expanded wild-card era. The worst years of era were from 2002 to 2006, when the Royals had four 100-loss seasons out of five. The team broke its postseason drought by securing the franchise's first ever wild card berth in 2014, and then advancing to the 2014 World Series. {  border=\\"1\\" - bgcolor=\\"#FFCCCC\\"World Series champions ‚Ä† bgcolor=\\"#ddffdd\\"AL champions * bgcolor=\\"#D0E7FF\\"Division champions ^ bgcolor=\\"#96CDCD\\"Wild card berth (1995‚Äìpresent) ¬§ } { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center; font-size:95%\\" -

It is based on pre-classical melodic forms that consist of a series of five or more musical notes upon which a melody is founded.Prof. Sridhara Uppara. 1998.Yakshagana and Nataka Diganta publications Yakshagana rƒÅgas have indigenous rƒÅgas and others derived from other forms of music. RƒÅgas in yakshagana are closely associated with a set of melodic forms called mattu. Yakshagana rƒÅgas have their own gamaka. Although yakshagana rƒÅgas share names with rƒÅgas in other Indian music systems, they are compositionally different, with a few exceptions. More than 80 rƒÅgas have been identified to have survived the onslaught of popular and elite musical systems.Dr. Shivarama Karantha, Yakshagana Bayalaata, Harsha Publications, 1963, Puttur, South Canara. In Yakshagana tradition, rƒÅgas are associated with different times of the night throughout which Yakshagana is performed. == Nature of yakshagana rƒÅga == RƒÅga describes a generalised form of melodic practice. It also records a set of rules for building the melody. Yakshagana rƒÅga follows not only these rules but also certain rhythmic and melodic structures called mattu. RƒÅga specifies the rules for movements up (aaroha [‡§Ü‡§∞‡•ã‡§π]) and down (avroha [‡§Ö‡§µ‡§∞‡•ã‡§π]) the musical scale; which swara (notes) should figure more and which should be used more sparingly; which notes to stress more; which notes may be sung with gamaka; phrases to be used; phrases to be avoided; and so on. The result is a framework that can be used to compose or improvise melodies, allowing for endless variation within the set of notes. What makes yakshagana singing different are, among other things, yaksha gamaka, which are distinct sets of notes and also way of approaching a note or rendering a note to form a particular mattu. More than adhering to stricter scale, yakshagana rƒÅga follows the metre of yakshagana poetry called the Yakshagana Chandhas. The melody is formed from a deep voice formed by controlling muscles as low as pelvic and abdominal muscles. This high pitched singing might have come out of need to reach all audience in a yakshagana bayalata, which is an outdoor activity. Recently singers have adopted softer singing because of the microphone. Some Hindustani rƒÅgas modified to suit yakshagana performance can also be seen (e.g. bhimpalas).Prof.Sridhar Uppura, Yakshagana and Nataka, Diganta publications, 1998 Yakshagana rƒÅgas are rendered but are not elaborated, sung swiftly to suit theatrical performance. Each song may complete within less than a minute, or a few minutes. Therefore, several songs of same rƒÅga used for various plots must be heard to experience the full features of yakshagana rƒÅga. == Yakshagana rƒÅga and time == Unlike in other classical forms yakshagana performance starts with RƒÅga Naati or Chala Naati in late evening (though the actual story or prasanga starts with RƒÅga Bhiravi), and ends with Mohana RƒÅga in early morning. == Yakshagana gamaka == Yakshagana music has its own gamakas. Yakshagana gamakas are name given to the set of sequence of notes often used in only in yakshagana rƒÅgas. It can also refer to, in popular parlance, inflections applied on notes. These gamakas give a distinct flavor to yakshagana rƒÅgas. These gamakas are learned by training and are among features such as mattu which make yakshagana sound different from other forms of music. == Indigenous yakshagana ragas == *Shatpadi (Note that this is different from Kannada prosody by the same name) *Sangatya *Kannada (This is different from Kaanada of Hindusthani) *Hoovu *Koore (This is different from Kore Tala) *Nepali *Gopanithe *Navarasa *Vrundhavana *Mechaali *Koravi *Divaali *Mechchu *Ghantaarava *Madhumaadhavi *Mechaali == Some well-known ragas == These ragas share names of the ragas of Karnataka Sangeetha but structurally different from them with very few exceptions. *Naati ---- Vaaranaa vadana/Mudadinda Ninnaaa *Sangatya ---- Kururaaaya idanella kandu *Regupti ---- Kelu *Kambhodhi ---- Shatrugna senegala sUtravanu sharisutta (Cognate of Hinsuthani raga) *Bhairavi ---- Elavo sanjayane kelu, any starting song of a prasanga *Madhyamavathi ---- *Kalyani *Kaaphi *Nilaambari *Paraju *Desi (Desh?) *Navaroju *Savaay *Saurashtra *Saranga *Saveri *Suruti *Todi *Begadi *Mukhari *Panturavali *Kedaragaula ---- Taye kel sri krishna rayana bari salu *Madhumadhavi *Mohana ---- Maranayyana Maata, ranganayaka rageeva lochana *Janjooti ==See also== *Melody type *Maqam *makam *echos *muqam *Nava rasas * RƒÅga, a documentary about the life and music of Ravi Shankar == Notes References== * *RƒÅga- Rupanjali Ratna Publications: Varanasi. 2007. * Yashagana Shruti Box Software Online/WINDOWS/Linux/Mobile/iPhone/Android. ==External links== * Yakshagana Shruti Software Category:Ragas Category:Yakshagana ","title":"Yakshagana raga"},{"id":"20191386","text":"Ismael Cortinas Ismael Cortinas (1884‚Äì1940) was a Uruguayan political figure, journalist and playwright. ==Background== Ismael Cortinas was born on 17 June 1884 in San Jos√© de Mayo, Uruguay, son of Miguel Cortinas and Laura Ventura Pel√°ez Maciel.

Residents of the area oppose uranium mining, although the history of the region is connected with various small gold rushes. ==References== * *Canadian Mountain Encyclopedia entry Category:Mountain ranges of British Columbia Category:Boundary Country ","title":"Beaverdell Range"},{"id":"20191416","text":"China Biologic Products, Inc., through its indirect majority-owned subsidiary Shandong Taibang, is the only blood plasma-based biopharmaceutical company approved by the government of Shandong Province, the second largest province in China with a population of 93 million.

In addition, this community has the highest diurnal (24 hour) temperature variation in Canada from June through September by means of the dry and sunny climate, valley bottom location, relatively high elevation, and the surrounding geography. Frost can occur even in the middle of summer. The daily temperature swings during the winter are less varied thanks to the presence of valley cloud. Despite its proximity to Kelowna, Beaverdell receives about 25% more rain, due to orographic precipitation induced by its higher elevation within the Okanagan Highland.

The head is whitish and the body pale brown shading to a dark brownish-black near the black tail. There are faint pale green longitudinal lines starting as dots at the head end and becoming continuous and then dotted again posteriorly. The juveniles are rather paler and have yellowish bars near the anterior end. They also have relatively larger dorsal fins. The adults have a white spine on the caudal peduncle. The large, sail-like dorsal fin has 4 or 5 spines and 23 to 25 soft rays. The anal fin has 3 spines and 19 to 21 soft rays.Zebrasoma scopas (Cuvier, 1829): Brown tang USGS. Retrieved 2012-02-28. ==Distribution== The brown tang is found in the Indo-Pacific region, living at water depths of up to . Its range extends from the coasts of East Africa to Japan, the Pitcairn Islands, Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, Australia, Lord Howe Island and Rapa Iti. In 2008, a brown tang was observed near Fort Lauderdale, Florida, far outside its native range. ==Biology== The brown tang feeds mainly on filamentous algae. For this purpose it has specialised pharyngeal teeth. It is usually found on the exposed side of reefs and in coral-rich lagoons. The adults are gregarious and sometimes form schools but the juveniles are solitary and are often to be found swimming among corals. The brown tang is monogamous, though spawning has been observed both between pairs and among small groups. The male tends to be larger than the female. The fish rush up to the surface to spawn, fertilisation is external and the eggs are scattered in the water column. The larvae are planktonic for several weeks before settling and undergoing metamorphosis into juveniles.Zebrasoma WetWebMedia. Retrieved 2012-02-28. ==Use in aquaria== Brown tangs are readily available and are easier tangs for the novice aquarist. Brown tangs do not bother coral and are safe to keep in a reef aquarium. They are smaller and less aggressive than other members of the family Acanthuridae. Brown tangs require an aquarium no less than 75 gallons. These fish are more tolerant of a wide range of living conditions. They will accept various food including meaty materials but the main part of the diet should be vegetable. They will eat the algae that tend to grow inadvertently in the tank.

These bases are unbiased in the following sense: if a system is prepared in a state belonging to one of the bases, then all outcomes of the measurement with respect to the other basis are predicted to occur with equal probability. == Overview == The notion of mutually unbiased bases was first introduced by Schwinger in 1960, and the first person to consider applications of mutually unbiased bases was Ivanovic in the problem of quantum state determination. Another area where mutually unbiased bases can be applied is quantum key distribution, more specifically in secure quantum key exchange.M. Planat et al, A Survey of Finite Algebraic Geometrical Structures Underlying Mutually Unbiased Quantum Measurements, http://hal.ccsd.cnrs.fr/docs/00/07/99/18/PDF/MUB_FP.pdf. Mutually unbiased bases are used in many protocols since the outcome is random when a measurement is made in a basis unbiased to that in which the state was prepared. When two remote parties share two non-orthogonal quantum states, attempts by an eavesdropper to distinguish between these by measurements will affect the system and this can be detected. While many quantum cryptography protocols have relied on 1-qubit technologies, employing higher-dimensional states, such as qutrits, allows for better security against eavesdropping. This motivates the study of mutually unbiased bases in higher-dimensional spaces. Other uses of mutually unbiased bases include quantum state reconstruction, quantum error correction codes, detection of quantum entanglement, and the so-called \\"mean king's problem\\". == Existence problem == Let \\\\mathfrak{M}(d) denote the maximum number of mutually unbiased bases in the d-dimensional Hilbert space Cd. It is an open question how many mutually unbiased bases, \\\\mathfrak{M}(d), one can find in Cd, for arbitrary d. In general, if : d = p_1^{n_1} p_2^{n_2} \\\\cdots p_k^{n_k} is the prime-power factorization of d, where : p_1^{n_1} < p_2^{n_2}<\\\\cdots then the maximum number of mutually unbiased bases which can be constructed satisfies :p_1^{n_1}+1 \\\\le \\\\mathfrak{M}(d) \\\\le d+1. It follows that if the dimension of a Hilbert space d is an integer power of a prime number, then it is possible to find d + 1 mutually unbiased bases. This can be seen in the previous equation, as the prime number decomposition of d simply is d = p^{n} . Therefore, : \\\\mathfrak{M}(p^n) = p^n + 1. Thus, the maximum number of mutually unbiased bases is known when d is an integer power of a prime number, but it is not known for arbitrary d. == Examples of sets of mutually unbiased bases  Example for d = 2 === The three bases : M_0 = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{  0 \\\\rangle, 1 \\\\rangle \\\\right\\\\\\\\} : M_1 = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\frac{ 0 \\\\rangle+ 1 \\\\rangle}{\\\\sqrt{2}},\\\\frac{ 0 \\\\rangle- 1 \\\\rangle}{\\\\sqrt{2}} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} : M_2 = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\frac{ 0 \\\\rangle+i  1 \\\\rangle}{\\\\sqrt{2}},\\\\frac{ 0 \\\\rangle-i 1 \\\\rangle}{\\\\sqrt{2}} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} provide the simplest example of mutually unbiased bases in C2. The above bases are composed of the eigenvectors of the Pauli spin matrices \\\\sigma_z, \\\\sigma_x and their product \\\\sigma_x \\\\sigma_z, respectively. === Example for d = 4 === For d = 4, an example of d + 1 = 5 mutually unbiased bases where each basis is denoted by Mj, 0 ‚â§ j ‚â§ 4, is given as follows: : M_0 = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{(1,0,0,0),(0,1,0,0),(0,0,1,0),(0,0,0,1)\\\\right\\\\\\\\} : M_1 = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\frac{1}{2}(1,1,1,1),\\\\frac{1}{2}(1,1,-1,-1),\\\\frac{1}{2}(1,-1,-1,1),\\\\frac{1}{2}(1,-1,1,-1)\\\\right\\\\\\\\} : M_2 = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\frac{1}{2}(1,-1,-i,-i),\\\\frac{1}{2}(1,-1,i,i),\\\\frac{1}{2}(1,1,i,-i),\\\\frac{1}{2}(1,1,-i,i)\\\\right\\\\\\\\} : M_3 = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\frac{1}{2}(1,-i,-i, -1),\\\\frac{1}{2}(1,-i,i,1),\\\\frac{1}{2}(1,i,i,-1),\\\\frac{1}{2}(1,i,-i,1)\\\\right\\\\\\\\} : M_4 = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\frac{1}{2}(1,-i,-1,-i),\\\\frac{1}{2}(1,-i,1,i),\\\\frac{1}{2}(1,i,-1,i),\\\\frac{1}{2}(1,i,1,-i)\\\\right\\\\\\\\} == Methods for finding mutually unbiased bases  Weyl group method === Let \\\\hat{X} and \\\\hat{Z} be two unitary operators in the Hilbert space Cd such that : \\\\hat{Z}\\\\hat{X} = \\\\omega\\\\hat{X}\\\\hat{Z} for some phase factor \\\\omega . If \\\\omega is a primitive root of unity, for example \\\\omega \\\\equiv e^{\\\\frac{2 \\\\pi i}{d}} then the eigenbases of \\\\hat{X} and \\\\hat{Z} are mutually unbiased. By choosing the eigenbasis of \\\\hat{Z} to be the standard basis, we can generate another basis unbiased to it using a Fourier matrix. The elements of the Fourier matrix are given by :F_{ab} = \\\\omega^{ab}, 0 \\\\le a,b \\\\le N-1 Other bases which are unbiased to both the standard basis and the basis generated by the Fourier matrix can be generated using Weyl groups. The dimension of the Hilbert space is important when generating sets of mutually unbiased bases using Weyl groups. When d is a prime number, then the usual d + 1 mutually unbiased bases can be generated using Weyl groups. When d is not a prime number, then it is possible that the maximal number of mutually unbiased bases which can be generated using this method is 3. === Unitary operators method using finite fields === When d = p is prime, we define the unitary operators \\\\hat{X} and \\\\hat{Z} by : \\\\hat{X} = \\\\sum_{k=0}^{d-1} k+1 \\\\rangle \\\\langle k : \\\\hat{Z} = \\\\sum_{k=0}^{d-1} \\\\omega^k k \\\\rangle \\\\langle k where \\\\\\\\{ k \\\\rangle  0 \\\\le j \\\\le d-1 \\\\\\\\} is the standard basis and \\\\omega = e^{\\\\frac{2\\\\pi i}{d}} is a root of unity. Then the eigenbases of the following d + 1 operators are mutually unbiased: : \\\\hat{X}, \\\\hat{Z}, \\\\hat{X} \\\\hat{Z}, \\\\hat{X} \\\\hat{Z}^2 ... \\\\hat{X} \\\\hat{Z}^{d-1} When d=p^r is a power of a prime, we make use of the finite field \\\\mathbb{F}_d to construct a maximal set of d + 1 mutually unbiased bases. We label the elements of the computational basis of Cd using the finite field: \\\\\\\\{ a \\\\rangle  a \\\\in \\\\mathbb{F}_d \\\\\\\\}. We define the operators \\\\hat{X_a} and \\\\hat{Z_b} in the following way :\\\\hat{X_a} = \\\\sum_{c \\\\in \\\\mathbb{F}_d} c + a \\\\rangle \\\\langle c :\\\\hat{Z_b} = \\\\sum_{c \\\\in \\\\mathbb{F}_d} \\\\chi (bc)c \\\\rangle \\\\langle c where :\\\\chi(\\\\theta) = \\\\exp \\\\left [ \\\\frac{2\\\\pi i }{p} \\\\left ( \\\\theta+ \\\\theta^p + \\\\theta^{p^2}+ \\\\cdots + \\\\theta^{p^{r-1}} \\\\right ) \\\\right ], is an additive character over the field and the addition and multiplication in the kets and \\\\chi(\\\\cdot) is that of \\\\mathbb{F}_d. Then we form d + 1 sets of commuting unitary operators: :\\\\\\\\{ \\\\hat{Z_s}  s \\\\in \\\\mathbb{F}_d \\\\\\\\} and \\\\\\\\{ \\\\hat{X_s}\\\\hat{Z_{sr}}  s \\\\in \\\\mathbb{F}_d \\\\\\\\} for each r \\\\in \\\\mathbb{F}_d The joint eigenbases of the operators in one set are mutually unbiased to that of any other set. We thus have d + 1 mutually unbiased bases. === Hadamard matrix method === Given that one basis in a Hilbert space is the standard basis, then all bases which are unbiased with respect to this basis can be represented by the columns of a complex Hadamard matrix multiplied by a normalization factor. For d = 3 these matrices would have the form : U = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{d}} \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ e^{i \\\\phi_{10}} & e^{i \\\\phi_{11}} & e^{i \\\\phi_{12}} \\\\\\\\\\\\ e^{i \\\\phi_{20}} & e^{i \\\\phi_{21}} & e^{i \\\\phi_{22}} \\\\end{bmatrix} The problem of finding a set of k+1 mutually unbiased bases therefore corresponds to finding k mutually unbiased complex Hadamard matrices. An example of a one parameter family of Hadamard matrices in a 4-dimensional Hilbert space is : H_4(\\\\phi) = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & e^{i\\\\phi} & -1 & -e^{i \\\\phi} \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & -1 & 1 & -1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & -e^{i\\\\phi} & -1 & e^{i\\\\phi} \\\\end{bmatrix} == The problem of finding a maximal set of MUBs when d = 6 == The smallest dimension that is not an integer power of a prime is d = 6\\\\. This is also the smallest dimension for which the number of mutually unbiased bases is not known. The methods used to determine the number of mutually unbiased bases when d is an integer power of a prime number cannot be used in this case. Searches for a set of four mutually unbiased bases when d = 6, both by using Hadamard matrices and numerical methodsP. Butterley, W. Hall \\"Numerical evidence for the maximum number of mutually unbiased bases in dimension six, 2007, https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0701122. have been unsuccessful. The general belief is that the maximum number of mutually unbiased bases for d = 6 is \\\\mathfrak{M}(6) = 3 . == Entropic uncertainty relations and MUBs == There is an alternative characterization of mutually unbiased bases that considers them in terms of uncertainty relations. Entropic uncertainty relations are analogous to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, and Maassen and UffinkH. Maassen, J.B.M. Uffink: Generalized entropic uncertainty relations: Phys. Rev. Lett. 60, 1103‚Äì1106 (1988). found that for any two bases B_1 = \\\\\\\\{ a_{i}\\\\rangle_{i=1}^d \\\\\\\\} and B_2 = \\\\\\\\{  b_{j} \\\\rangle _{j=1}^{d} \\\\\\\\}: : H_{B_1} + H_{B_2} \\\\geq -2\\\\log c. where c = \\\\max  \\\\langle a_j  b_k \\\\rangle  and H_{B_1} and H_{B_2} is the respective entropy of the bases B_1 and B_2, when measuring a given state. Entropic uncertainty relations are often preferable to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, as they are not phrased in terms of the state to be measured, but in terms of c. In scenarios such as quantum key distribution, we aim for measurement bases such that full knowledge of a state with respect to one basis implies minimal knowledge of the state with respect to the other bases. This implies a high entropy of measurement outcomes, and thus we call these strong entropic uncertainty relations. For two bases, the lower bound of the uncertainty relation is maximized when the measurement bases are mutually unbiased, since mutually unbiased bases are maximally incompatible: the outcome of a measurement made in a basis unbiased to that in which the state is prepared in is completely random. In fact, for a d-dimensional space, we have: : H_{B_1} + H_{B_2} \\\\geq \\\\log (d) for any pair of mutually unbiased bases B_1 and B_2. This bound is optimal: If we measure a state from one of the bases then the outcome has entropy 0 in that basis and an entropy of \\\\log(d) in the other. If the dimension of the space is a prime power, we can construct d + 1 MUBs, and then it has been found thatS. Wehner and A. Winter, 2010 New J. Phys. 12 025009: http://iopscience.iop.org/1367-2630/12/2/025009/. : \\\\sum_{k=1}^{d+1} H_{B_k} \\\\geq (d+1) \\\\log\\\\left(\\\\frac{d+1}{2} \\\\right) which is stronger than the relation we would get from pairing up the sets and then using the Maassen and Uffink equation. Thus we have a characterization of d + 1 mutually unbiased bases as those for which the uncertainty relations are strongest. Although the case for two bases, and for d + 1 bases is well studied, very little is known about uncertainty relations for mutually unbiased bases in other circumstances. When considering more than two, and less than d+1 bases it is known that large sets of mutually unbiased bases exist which exhibit very little uncertainty. This means merely being mutually unbiased does not lead to high uncertainty, except when considering measurements in only two bases. Yet there do exist other measurements that are very uncertain. == Mutually unbiased bases in infinite dimension Hilbert spaces == While there has been investigation into mutually unbiased bases in infinite dimension Hilbert space, their existence remains an open question. It is conjectured that in a continuous Hilbert space, two orthonormal bases \\\\psi_s^b \\\\rangle and \\\\psi_{s'}^{b'} \\\\rangle are said to be mutually unbiased if : \\\\langle \\\\psi_s^b  \\\\psi_{s'}^{b'} \\\\rangle^2 = k>0, s,s'\\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} For the generalized position and momentum eigenstates  q \\\\rangle, q\\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} and  p \\\\rangle,p\\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} , the value of k is : \\\\langle q  p \\\\rangle^2 = \\\\frac{1}{2 \\\\pi \\\\hbar} The existence of mutually unbiased bases in a continuous Hilbert space remains open for debate, as further research in their existence is required before any conclusions can be reached. Position states  q \\\\rangle and momentum states  p \\\\rangle are eigenvectors of Hermitian operators \\\\hat{x} and -i \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x} , respectively. Weigert and Wilkinson were first to notice that also a linear combination of these operators have eigenbases, which have some features typical for the mutually unbiased bases. An operator \\\\alpha \\\\hat{x}-i\\\\beta\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x} has eigenfunctions proportional to \\\\exp(i(ax^2+bx)) \\\\, with \\\\alpha+2\\\\beta a=0 and the corresponding eigenvalues b\\\\beta . If we parametrize \\\\alpha and \\\\beta as \\\\cos \\\\theta and \\\\sin \\\\theta , the overlap between any eigenstate of the linear combination and any eigenstate of the position operator (both states normalized to the Dirac delta) is constant, but dependent on \\\\beta : : \\\\langle x_\\\\thetax \\\\rangle ^2=\\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi\\\\sin\\\\theta}, where x\\\\rangle and x_\\\\theta\\\\rangle stand for eigenfunctions of \\\\hat{x} and \\\\cos\\\\theta\\\\hat{x}-i \\\\sin \\\\theta \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x}. == References == Category:Quantum information theory ","title":"Mutually unbiased bases"},{"id":"20191660","text":"Rock Creek is an unincorporated settlement in the Boundary Country of the Southern Interior of British Columbia, Canada.

The most common Talas in Yakshagana are Matte, Eaka,Udaape, Jampe, Rupaka, Trivde, Atta, KorE and Aadi. Each tala has a cycle of N beats divided in M bars.

A set of syllables representing the basic rhythm of taala is called 'Badtige' or 'Tatkaara'. The variations of a particular taala are called 'Nade' (movement) which is similar to Kaida in Tabla. Yakshagana music vocalists (Bhagavathas) mark the tala by tapping a pair of bells.

Helium is composed of two electrons bound by the electromagnetic force to a nucleus containing two protons along with either one or two neutrons, depending on the isotope, held together by the strong force. Unlike for hydrogen, a closed-form solution to the Schr√∂dinger equation for the helium atom has not been found. However, various approximations, such as the Hartree‚ÄìFock method, can be used to estimate the ground state energy and wavefunction of the atom. ==Introduction== Schematic termscheme for Para- and Orthohelium with one electron in ground state 1s and one excited electron. The quantum mechanical description of the helium atom is of special interest, because it is the simplest multi-electron system and can be used to understand the concept of quantum entanglement. The Hamiltonian of helium, considered as a three-body system of two electrons and a nucleus and after separating out the centre-of- mass motion, can be written as : H(\\\\vec{r}_1,\\\\, \\\\vec{r}_2) = \\\\sum_{i=1,2}\\\\Bigg(-\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2\\\\mu} abla^2_{r_i} -\\\\frac{Ze^2}{4\\\\pi\\\\epsilon_0 r_i}\\\\Bigg) - \\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{M} abla_{r_1} \\\\cdot abla_{r_2} + \\\\frac{e^2}{4\\\\pi\\\\epsilon_0 r_{12}} where \\\\mu = \\\\frac{mM}{m+M} is the reduced mass of an electron with respect to the nucleus, \\\\vec{r}_1 and \\\\vec{r}_2 are the electron-nucleus distance vectors and r_{12} = \\\\vec{r_1} - \\\\vec{r_2} . The nuclear charge, Z is 2 for helium. In the approximation of an infinitely heavy nucleus, M = \\\\infty we have \\\\mu = m and the mass polarization term \\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{M} abla_{r_1} \\\\cdot abla_{r_2} disappears. In atomic units the Hamiltonian simplifies to : H(\\\\vec{r}_1,\\\\, \\\\vec{r}_2) = -\\\\frac{1}{2} abla^2_{r_1} - \\\\frac{1}{2} abla^2_{r_2} - \\\\frac{Z}{r_1} - \\\\frac{Z}{r_2} + \\\\frac{1}{r_{12}}. It is important to note, that it operates not in normal space, but in a 6-dimensional configuration space (\\\\vec{r}_1,\\\\, \\\\vec{r}_2). In this approximation (Pauli approximation) the wave function is a second order spinor with 4 components \\\\psi_{ij}(\\\\vec{r}_1,\\\\, \\\\vec{r}_2), where the indices i,j = \\\\,\\\\uparrow,\\\\downarrow describe the spin projection of both electrons (z-direction up or down) in some coordinate system.P. Rennert, H. Schmiedel, C. Wei√ümantel. \\"Kleine Enzyklop√§die Physik\\", VEB Bibliographisches Institut Leipzig, 1988, 192-194. It has to obey the usual normalization condition \\\\sum_{ij}\\\\int d\\\\vec{r}_1 d\\\\vec{r}_2\\\\psi_{ij}^2 = 1. This general spinor can be written as 2x2 matrix \\\\boldsymbol \\\\psi = \\\\begin{pmatrix}\\\\psi_{\\\\uparrow\\\\uparrow} & \\\\psi_{\\\\uparrow\\\\downarrow} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\psi_{\\\\downarrow\\\\uparrow} & \\\\psi_{\\\\downarrow\\\\downarrow} \\\\end{pmatrix} and consequently also as linear combination of any given basis of four orthogonal (in the vector-space of 2x2 matrices) constant matrices \\\\boldsymbol \\\\sigma^i_k with scalar function coefficients \\\\phi^k_i (\\\\vec{r}_1,\\\\, \\\\vec{r}_2) as \\\\boldsymbol \\\\psi = \\\\sum_{ik}\\\\phi^k_i (\\\\vec{r}_1,\\\\, \\\\vec{r}_2) \\\\boldsymbol \\\\sigma^i_k . A convenient basis consists of one anti-symmetric matrix (with total spin S = 0, corresponding to a singlet state) > \\\\boldsymbol \\\\sigma^0_0 = \\\\frac 1{\\\\sqrt 2} \\\\begin{pmatrix}0 & 1\\\\\\\\\\\\ -1 & 0 > \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\frac 1{\\\\sqrt 2}(\\\\uparrow\\\\downarrow - \\\\downarrow\\\\uparrow) and three symmetric matrices (with total spin S = 1, corresponding to a triplet state) > \\\\boldsymbol \\\\sigma^1_0 = \\\\frac 1{\\\\sqrt 2} \\\\begin{pmatrix}0 & 1\\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 0 > \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\frac 1{\\\\sqrt 2}(\\\\uparrow\\\\downarrow + \\\\downarrow\\\\uparrow)\\\\; > ; \\\\boldsymbol \\\\sigma^1_1 = \\\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix} = > \\\\;\\\\uparrow\\\\uparrow\\\\; ; \\\\boldsymbol \\\\sigma^1_{-1} = \\\\begin{pmatrix}0 & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 > & 1 \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\;\\\\downarrow\\\\downarrow \\\\; . It is easy to show, that the singlet state is invariant under all rotations (a scalar entity), while the triplet can be mapped to an ordinary space vector (\\\\sigma_x,\\\\sigma_y,\\\\sigma_z) , with the three components > \\\\sigma_x = \\\\frac 1{\\\\sqrt 2} \\\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & -1 \\\\end{pmatrix} , > \\\\sigma_y = \\\\frac i{\\\\sqrt 2} \\\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1\\\\end{pmatrix} and > \\\\sigma_z = \\\\frac 1{\\\\sqrt 2} \\\\begin{pmatrix}0 & 1\\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix} . Since all spin interaction terms between the four components of \\\\boldsymbol \\\\psi in the above (scalar) Hamiltonian are neglected (e.g. an external magnetic field, or relativistic effects, like angular momentum coupling), the four Schr√∂dinger equations can be solved independently. L.D. Landau, E.M. Lifschitz. \\"Lehrbuch der Theoretischen Physik\\", Bd. III (Quantenmechanik), Akademie-Verlag, Berlin 1971, Kap. IX, pp. 218 The spin here only comes into play through the Pauli exclusion principle, which for fermions (like electrons) requires antisymmetry under simultaneous exchange of spin and coordinates :\\\\boldsymbol \\\\psi_{ij} (\\\\vec{r}_1,\\\\, \\\\vec{r}_2) = - \\\\boldsymbol \\\\psi_{ji} (\\\\vec{r}_2,\\\\, \\\\vec{r}_1). Parahelium is then the singlet state \\\\boldsymbol \\\\psi = \\\\phi_0 (\\\\vec{r}_1,\\\\, \\\\vec{r}_2) \\\\boldsymbol \\\\sigma^0_0 with a symmetric function \\\\phi_0 (\\\\vec{r}_1,\\\\, \\\\vec{r}_2) = \\\\phi_0 (\\\\vec{r}_2,\\\\, \\\\vec{r}_1) and orthohelium is the triplet state \\\\boldsymbol \\\\psi_m = \\\\phi_1 (\\\\vec{r}_1,\\\\, \\\\vec{r}_2)\\\\boldsymbol \\\\sigma^1_m,\\\\; m =-1,0,1 with an antisymmetric function \\\\phi_1(\\\\vec{r}_1,\\\\, \\\\vec{r}_2) = -\\\\phi_1 (\\\\vec{r}_2,\\\\, \\\\vec{r}_1). If the electron-electron interaction term is ignored, both spatial functions \\\\phi_x,\\\\; x = 0,1 can be written as linear combination of two arbitrary (orthogonal and normalized) one-electron eigenfunctions \\\\varphi_a, \\\\varphi_b: > \\\\phi_x = \\\\frac 1 {\\\\sqrt 2}(\\\\varphi_a(\\\\vec{r}_1) \\\\varphi_b(\\\\vec{r}_2) \\\\pm > \\\\varphi_a(\\\\vec{r}_2) \\\\varphi_b(\\\\vec{r}_1)) or for the special cases of \\\\varphi_a = \\\\varphi_b (both electrons have identical quantum numbers, parahelium only): \\\\phi_0 = \\\\varphi_a(\\\\vec{r}_1) \\\\varphi_a(\\\\vec{r}_2) . The total energy (as eigenvalue of H ) is then for all cases E = E_a + E_b (independent of the symmetry). This explains the absence of the 1^3 S_1 state (with \\\\varphi_a = \\\\varphi_b = \\\\varphi_{1s} ) for orthohelium, where consequently 2^3S_1 (with \\\\varphi_a = \\\\varphi_{1s}, \\\\varphi_b = \\\\varphi_{2s} ) is the metastable ground state. (A state with the quantum numbers: principal quantum number n, total spin S, angular quantum number L and total angular momentum J = L-S \\\\dots L+S is denoted by n^{2S+1}L_J.) If the electron-electron interaction term \\\\frac 1{r_{12}} is included, the Schr√∂dinger equation is non separable. However, also if is neglected, all states described above (even with two identical quantum numbers, like 1^1S_0 with \\\\boldsymbol\\\\psi= \\\\varphi_{1s}(\\\\vec{r}_1)\\\\varphi_{1s}(\\\\vec{r}_2) \\\\boldsymbol \\\\sigma^0_0 ) cannot be written as a product of one-electron wave functions: \\\\psi_{ik}(\\\\vec{r}_1,\\\\, \\\\vec{r}_2) eq \\\\chi_i (\\\\vec{r}_1)\\\\xi_k(\\\\vec{r}_2) ‚Äî the wave function is entangled. One cannot say, particle 1 is in state 1 and the other in state 2, and measurements cannot be made on one particle without affecting the other. Nevertheless, quite good theoretical descriptions of helium can be obtained within the Hartree‚ÄìFock and Thomas‚ÄìFermi approximations (see below). ==Hartree‚ÄìFock method== The Hartree‚ÄìFock method is used for a variety of atomic systems. However it is just an approximation, and there are more accurate and efficient methods used today to solve atomic systems. The \\"many-body problem\\" for helium and other few electron systems can be solved quite accurately. For example, the ground state of helium is known to fifteen digits. In Hartree‚ÄìFock theory, the electrons are assumed to move in a potential created by the nucleus and the other electrons. The Hamiltonian for helium with two electrons can be written as a sum of the Hamiltonians for each electron: H = \\\\sum_{i=1}^2 h(i) = H_0 + H^{\\\\prime} where the zero-order unperturbed Hamiltonian is H_0 = -\\\\frac{1}{2} abla_{r_1}^2 - \\\\frac{1}{2} abla_{r_2}^2 - \\\\frac{Z}{r_1} - \\\\frac{Z}{r_2} while the perturbation term: H' = \\\\frac{1}{r_{12}} is the electron-electron interaction. H0 is just the sum of the two hydrogenic Hamiltonians: H_0 = \\\\hat{h}_1 + \\\\hat{h}_2 where \\\\hat{h}_i = -\\\\frac{1}{2} abla_{r_i}^2 - \\\\frac{Z}{r_i}, i=1,2 Eni, the energy eigenvalues and \\\\psi_{n_i,l_i,m_i}(\\\\vec{r}_i) , the corresponding eigenfunctions of the hydrogenic Hamiltonian will denote the normalized energy eigenvalues and the normalized eigenfunctions. So: \\\\hat{h}_i \\\\psi_{n_i,l_i,m_i}(\\\\vec{r_i}) = E_{n_i} \\\\psi_{n_i,l_i,m_i}(\\\\vec{r_i}) where E_{n_i} = - \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\frac{Z^2}{n_i^2} \\\\text{ in a.u.} Neglecting the electron-electron repulsion term, the Schr√∂dinger equation for the spatial part of the two-electron wave function will reduce to the 'zero-order' equation H_0\\\\psi^{(0)}(\\\\vec{r}_1, \\\\vec{r}_2) = E^{(0)} \\\\psi^{(0)}(\\\\vec{r}_1, \\\\vec{r}_2) This equation is separable and the eigenfunctions can be written in the form of single products of hydrogenic wave functions: \\\\psi^{(0)}(\\\\vec{r}_1, \\\\vec{r}_2) = \\\\psi_{n_1,l_1,m_1}(\\\\vec{r}_1) \\\\psi_{n_2,l_2,m_2}(\\\\vec{r}_2) The corresponding energies are (in atomic units, hereafter a.u.): E^{(0)}_{n_1,n_2} = E_{n_1} + E_{n_2} = - \\\\frac{Z^2}{2} \\\\Bigg[\\\\frac{1}{n_1^2} + \\\\frac{1}{n_2^2} \\\\Bigg] Note that the wave function \\\\psi^{(0)}(\\\\vec{r}_2, \\\\vec{r}_1) = \\\\psi_{n_2,l_2,m_2}(\\\\vec{r}_1) \\\\psi_{n_1,l_1,m_1}(\\\\vec{r}_2) An exchange of electron labels corresponds to the same energy E^{(0)}_{n_1,n_2} . This particular case of degeneracy with respect to exchange of electron labels is called exchange degeneracy. The exact spatial wave functions of two-electron atoms must either be symmetric or antisymmetric with respect to the interchange of the coordinates \\\\vec{r}_1 and \\\\vec{r}_2 of the two electrons. The proper wave function then must be composed of the symmetric (+) and antisymmetric(-) linear combinations: \\\\psi^{(0)}_\\\\pm(\\\\vec{r}_1, \\\\vec{r}_2) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}} [\\\\psi_{n_1,l_1,m_1}(\\\\vec{r}_1) \\\\psi_{n_2,l_2,m_2}(\\\\vec{r}_2) \\\\pm \\\\psi_{n_2,l_2,m_2}(\\\\vec{r}_1) \\\\psi_{n_1,l_1,m_1}(\\\\vec{r}_2)] This comes from Slater determinants. The factor \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}} normalizes \\\\psi^{(0)}_\\\\pm . In order to get this wave function into a single product of one-particle wave functions, we use the fact that this is in the ground state. So n_1=n_2=1,\\\\, l_1=l_2=0,\\\\, m_1=m_2=0 . So the \\\\psi^{(0)}_{-} will vanish, in agreement with the original formulation of the Pauli exclusion principle, in which two electrons cannot be in the same state. Therefore, the wave function for helium can be written as \\\\psi^{(0)}_0(\\\\vec{r}_1, \\\\vec{r}_2) = \\\\psi_1(\\\\vec{r_1}) \\\\psi_1(\\\\vec{r_2}) = \\\\frac{Z^3}{\\\\pi} e^{-Z(r_1 + r_2)} Where \\\\psi_1 and \\\\psi_2 use the wave functions for the hydrogen Hamiltonian. \\\\left(\\\\frac{Z}{a_0}\\\\right)^{\\\\frac{3}{2}}\\\\ e^{-{\\\\textstyle \\\\frac{Zr}{a_0}}}\\\\; . In atomic units, the Bohr radius {a_0} equals 1, and the wavefunction becomes \\\\psi_(r) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\pi}} Z^{\\\\frac{3}{2}}\\\\ e^{-{\\\\textstyle Zr}}\\\\; .}} For helium, Z = 2 from E^{(0)}_0 = E^{(0)}_{n_1=1,\\\\, n_2=1} = -Z^2 \\\\text{ a.u.} where E^{(0)}_0 = ‚àí4 a.u. which is approximately ‚àí108.8 eV, which corresponds to an ionization potential V_P^{(0)} = 2 a.u. (‚âÖ54.4 eV). The experimental values are E_0 = ‚àí2.90 a.u. (‚âÖ ‚àí79.0 eV) and V_p = 0.90 a.u. (‚âÖ 24.6 eV). The energy that we obtained is too low because the repulsion term between the electrons was ignored, whose effect is to raise the energy levels. As Z gets bigger, our approach should yield better results, since the electron-electron repulsion term will get smaller. So far a very crude independent-particle approximation has been used, in which the electron- electron repulsion term is completely omitted. Splitting the Hamiltonian showed below will improve the results: H = \\\\bar{H_0} + \\\\bar{H'} where \\\\bar{H_0} = -\\\\frac{1}{2} abla^2_{r_1} + V(r_1) - \\\\frac{1}{2} abla^2_{r_2} + V(r_2) and \\\\bar{H'} = \\\\frac{1}{r_{12}} - \\\\frac{Z}{r_1} -V(r_1) - \\\\frac{Z}{r_2} - V(r_2) V(r) is a central potential which is chosen so that the effect of the perturbation \\\\bar{H'} is small. The net effect of each electron on the motion of the other one is to screen somewhat the charge of the nucleus, so a simple guess for V(r) is V(r) = -\\\\frac{Z-S}{r} = - \\\\frac{Z_e}{r} where S is a screening constant and the quantity Ze is the effective charge. The potential is a Coulomb interaction, so the corresponding individual electron energies are given (in a.u.) by E_0 = -(Z-S)^2 = - Z_e^2 and the corresponding wave function is given by \\\\psi_0(r_1\\\\, r_2) = \\\\frac{Z_e^3}{\\\\pi} e^{-Z_e(r_1 + r_2)} If Ze was 1.70, that would make the expression above for the ground state energy agree with the experimental value E0 = ‚àí2.903 a.u. of the ground state energy of helium. Since Z = 2 in this case, the screening constant is S = 0.30. For the ground state of helium, for the average shielding approximation, the screening effect of each electron on the other one is equivalent to about \\\\frac{1}{3} of the electronic charge.B.H. Bransden and C.J. Joachain's Physics of Atoms and Molecules 2nd edition Pearson Education, Inc ==Thomas‚ÄìFermi method== Not long after Schr√∂dinger developed the wave equation, the Thomas‚ÄìFermi model was developed. Density functional theory is used to describe the particle density \\\\rho(\\\\vec{r}),\\\\, r\\\\, \\\\epsilon\\\\, \\\\reals^3, and the ground state energy E(N), where N is the number of electrons in the atom. If there are a large number of electrons, the Schr√∂dinger equation runs into problems, because it gets very difficult to solve, even in the atom's ground states. This is where density functional theory comes in. Thomas‚ÄìFermi theory gives very good intuition of what is happening in the ground states of atoms and molecules with N electrons. The energy functional for an atom with N electrons is given by: \\\\xi = \\\\frac{3}{5} \\\\gamma \\\\int_{\\\\reals^3} \\\\rho^{5/3}(\\\\vec{r}) d^3\\\\vec{r}\\\\, + \\\\int_{\\\\reals^3} V(\\\\vec{r}) \\\\rho(\\\\vec{r}) d^3\\\\vec{r}\\\\, + \\\\frac{e^2}{2} \\\\int_{\\\\reals^3} \\\\frac{\\\\rho(\\\\vec{r})\\\\rho(\\\\vec{r'})}{\\\\vec{r} - \\\\vec{r'}}\\\\, d^3\\\\vec{r}d^3\\\\vec{r'} Where \\\\gamma = (3\\\\pi^2)^{2/3} \\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2m} The electron density needs to be greater than or equal to 0, \\\\int_{\\\\reals^3} \\\\rho = N, and \\\\rho \\\\rightarrow \\\\xi is convex. In the energy functional, each term holds a certain meaning. The first term describes the minimum quantum- mechanical kinetic energy required to create the electron density \\\\rho(\\\\vec{x}) for an N number of electrons. The next term is the attractive interaction of the electrons with the nuclei through the Coulomb potential V(\\\\vec{r}) . The final term is the electron-electron repulsion potential energy.http://www.physics.nyu.edu/LarrySpruch/Lieb.pdf So the Hamiltonian for a system of many electrons can be written: H = \\\\sum_{i=1}^N \\\\Bigg[-\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2m} abla_i^2 + V(\\\\vec{r_i})\\\\Bigg] + \\\\int \\\\frac{e^2\\\\rho(\\\\vec{r'})}{\\\\vec{r} - \\\\vec{r'}} d^3r' For helium, N = 2, so the Hamiltonian is given by: H = -\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2m} ( abla_1^2 + abla_2^2) + V(\\\\vec{r_1}, \\\\, \\\\vec{r_2}) + \\\\int \\\\frac{e^2 \\\\rho(\\\\vec{r'})} {\\\\vec{r} - \\\\vec{r'}} d^3r' Where \\\\int \\\\frac{e^2 \\\\rho(\\\\vec{r'})} {\\\\vec{r} - \\\\vec{r'}} d^3r' = \\\\frac{e^2}{4\\\\pi\\\\epsilon_0} \\\\frac{1}{\\\\vec{r}_1 - \\\\vec{r}_2},\\\\, \\\\text{ and }\\\\, V(\\\\vec{r_1}, \\\\, \\\\vec{r_2}) = \\\\frac{e^2}{4\\\\pi\\\\epsilon_0} \\\\Bigg[\\\\frac{2}{r_1} + \\\\frac{2}{r_2} \\\\Bigg] yielding H = -\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2m} ( abla_1^2 + abla_2^2) + \\\\frac{e^2}{4\\\\pi\\\\epsilon_0} \\\\Bigg[\\\\frac{2}{r_1} + \\\\frac{2}{r_2} - \\\\frac{1}{\\\\vec{r}_1 - \\\\vec{r}_2}\\\\Bigg] From the Hartree‚ÄìFock method, it is known that ignoring the electron-electron repulsion term, the energy is 8E1 = ‚àí109 eV. ==The variational method== To obtain a more accurate energy the variational principle can be applied to the electron-electron potential Vee using the wave function \\\\psi_0(\\\\vec{r}_1,\\\\, \\\\vec{r}_2) = \\\\frac{8}{\\\\pi a^3} e^{-2(r_1+r_2)/a} : \\\\langle H \\\\rangle = 8E_1 + \\\\langle V_{ee} \\\\rangle = 8E_1 + \\\\Bigg(\\\\frac{e^2}{4\\\\pi\\\\epsilon_0}\\\\Bigg) \\\\Bigg(\\\\frac{8}{\\\\pi a^3}\\\\Bigg)^2 \\\\int \\\\frac{e^{-4(r_1 + r_2)/a}} {\\\\vec{r}_1 - \\\\vec{r}_2}\\\\, d^3\\\\vec{r}_1 \\\\, d^3\\\\vec{r}_2 After integrating this, the result is: \\\\langle H \\\\rangle = 8E_1 + \\\\frac{5}{4a} \\\\Bigg(\\\\frac{e^2}{4\\\\pi\\\\epsilon_0}\\\\Bigg) = 8E_1 - \\\\frac{5}{2}E_1 = -109 + 34 = -75 \\\\text{ eV} This is closer to the experimental value, but if a better trial wave function is used, an even more accurate answer could be obtained. An ideal wave function would be one that doesn't ignore the influence of the other electron. In other words, each electron represents a cloud of negative charge which somewhat shields the nucleus so that the other electron actually sees an effective nuclear charge Z that is less than 2. A wave function of this type is given by: \\\\psi(\\\\vec{r}_1, \\\\vec{r}_2) = \\\\frac{Z^3}{\\\\pi a^3} e^{-Z(r_1+r_2)/a} Treating Z as a variational parameter to minimize H. The Hamiltonian using the wave function above is given by: \\\\langle H \\\\rangle = 2Z^2E_1 + 2(Z-2) \\\\Bigg(\\\\frac{e^2}{4\\\\pi\\\\epsilon_0}\\\\Bigg) \\\\left\\\\langle \\\\frac{1}{r} \\\\right\\\\rangle + \\\\left\\\\langle V_{ee} \\\\right\\\\rangle After calculating the expectation value of \\\\frac{1}{r} and Vee the expectation value of the Hamiltonian becomes: \\\\langle H \\\\rangle = \\\\left[-2Z^2 + \\\\frac{27}{4}Z\\\\right]E_1 The minimum value of Z needs to be calculated, so taking a derivative with respect to Z and setting the equation to 0 will give the minimum value of Z: \\\\frac{d}{dZ} \\\\left(\\\\left[-2Z^2 + \\\\frac{27}{4}Z\\\\right] E_1\\\\right) = 0 Z = \\\\frac{27}{16} \\\\sim 1.69 This shows that the other electron somewhat shields the nucleus reducing the effective charge from 2 to 1.69. So we obtain the most accurate result yet: \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\Bigg(\\\\frac{3}{2}\\\\Bigg)^6 E_1 = -77.5 \\\\text{ eV} Where again, E1 represents the ionization energy of hydrogen. By using more complicated/accurate wave functions, the ground state energy of helium has been calculated closer and closer to the experimental value ‚àí78.95 eV.David I.

They may live at water depths of 1 - 60 m (3 - 200 ft) or more. The fish grow to a maximum length of 40 cm (15.8 in). It has an extensive range throughout Oceania, the Indian Ocean, and the South Pacific. Zebrasoma veliferum is a popular fish in the aquarium trade. They are herbivorous fish specializing in filamentous algae. Though their skin is light beige with stripes, it can turn dark brown under stress. ==Description== Stamp of Kazakhstan This species is one of the largest members of its genus. The largest scientifically measured sailfin tang was 40.0 cm (15.7 in). The body of the sailfin tang is disc-shaped with a much elevated dorsal fin and a big anal fin. It has an extended snout. Compared to the other members of the genus Zebrasoma, the sailfin tang has larger but fewer pharyngeal teeth. On each side of the caudal peduncle is a single sharp spine (the so-called scalpel) which is used for defence and to establish dominance. When the fish is not using its scalpel, it is folded down inside a groove. The sailfin tang is decorated with broad, pale yellow bands that alternate with darker bands over its body. The bending extends into both dorsal and anal fins. On the darker bands are yellow dots and stripes. The caudal fin is yellow. The head of the fish is white adorned with yellow dots. A dark band with yellow dots runs across the eye and another dark band with dots is located right behind the eye.

She has completed extensive field work studying the daily lives of African-Americans and European-Americans. She is also credited with the creation of the term concerted cultivation. This concept refers to middle class child rearing practices. She says that this differs from the parents of children in working-class families, who attribute much of their child raising tactics to the accomplishment of natural growth. ==Education== Lareau is a graduate of U.C. Santa Cruz and earned her PhD in Sociology from U.C. Berkeley. She started her career at Southern Illinois University at Carbondale and also previously worked as a Professor of Sociology at Temple University, Pennsylvania from 1990 to 2005. She has served as a professor of sociology at the University of Maryland, College Park, and in 2008 joined as professor of Sociology at the University of Pennsylvania where she is the Stanley I. Sheerr Professor. During the 2005‚Äì2006 school year she moved to Palo Alto, California to complete a residence at the Center for Advanced Study of Behavioral Sciences. Lareau has been very active with organizations such as the Eastern Sociological Society, Sociology of Education journal, and the American Sociological Association. ==Writings== Lareau is the author of Home Advantage: Social Class and Parental Intervention in Elementary Education (1989), co- editor of Journeys through Ethnography: Realistic Accounts of Fieldwork (1996), and author of Unequal Childhoods: Class, Race, and Family Life (2003). She conducted field work between 1993 and 1995 with 10- and 11-year-old children, and followed up with them 10 years later when the children were 20 and 21 years old. ===Unequal Childhoods=== Her field research was the basis for her book Unequal Childhoods, which explained in detail her research and interviews with 88 children and their parents. The subjects included white and black children from middle class, working class, and poor families. Through her observations she discovered differences in parenting styles that related to class distinctions. Specifically, she observed how different family circumstances influenced the children's performance and interactions in and out of school. Her findings allowed her to draw a major distinction between the parenting styles of working class / poor parents and middle class parents. In this book, she highlights the benefits and shortcomings of raising children through either concerted cultivation or natural growth. \\"Concerted cultivation\\" is the type of childrearing that middle class parents practice. This childrearing practice consists of parents participating in the organization of their child's afterschool activities and providing a structured life for their child. The parents generally have a better education and try to impress this upon their child on a daily basis. Parents teach their children things that are not taught in school that will help them to perform better and get better grades on tests and ultimately do better in school. The main advantage to this type of childrearing is that children are taught lessons through organized activities that help prepare them for a white collar job and the types of interactions that a white-collar worker encounters. Some examples of this type of parental teaching is engagement in critical thinking such as asking challenging questions, the use of advanced grammar, and help a stronger family support structure. The main disadvantage of concerted cultivation is that often the child becomes bored easily and cannot entertain themselves. \\"The Accomplishment of Natural Growth\\" is the type of childrearing that working class and poor parents practice, and not necessarily by choice. They are less involved with the structure of their child‚Äôs after school activities and generally have less education and time to impress values upon their children that will give them an advantage in school. This type of childrearing involves less organized activities and more free time for their children to play with other children in the neighborhood. The book Unequal Childhoods includes detailed descriptions of her encounters and organized data from her analysis. She compiled a list of formal and informal activities that specific children were involved in, whether they were middle class, working class, or poor, and whether they have requested a teacher for their children. There is also information about whether or not the parents knew people who are psychologists, doctors, lawyers, or teachers. The book contains a great deal of quotes, stories of her experiences while observing, and connections that explain why particular children might act a certain way. Each chapter is an in-depth analysis of a different family, concerning the specific situation surrounding the child and how it has affected their life. From all her observations and analysis, Lareau concludes that the different types of childrearing have more to do with class than race. Through her research she has found that the childrearing ways of the middle class perpetuate inequality because of the advantages that the children have through participation in extracurricular activities, engagement in critical thinking and problem solving. These practices of more parental involvement are what perpetuate inequalities from one generation to the next. Lareau stresses the importance of parents being involved in their children's lives and talks about how middle class children benefit from having a sense of entitlement and the practice of gaining access to scarce resources. She also stresses the importance of literacy as a huge factor in a child's success. A second edition of the book was released in September 2011; it added over 100 new pages of text to the original version. ==Data collection process== In 1989‚Äì1990 Lareau observed white and black children from two third-grade classrooms in a small Midwestern town, Lawrenceville, and interviewed their mothers, fathers, and guardians, as well as school professionals working with the children. In 1992‚Äì1993 she received a grant from the Spencer Foundation to study a third grade classroom in Lower Richmond, an urban school district. In order to do this, she hired and trained five research assistants in 1993, who would carry out in-depth interviews with the families. Lareau and her research team studied 88 African- American and white families, and later chose 12 of the 88 families for more intensive visits. During the study, they visited the 12 families 20 times each, roughly two to three hours at a time, and accompanied them on various outings and appointments. Lareau conducted about half of the interviews, and did many family visits. Lareau wrote the first draft of her book Unequal Childhoods and completed the first edition of the book by 2002. Unequal Childhoods was discussed by Malcolm Gladwell in his book Outliers. A second edition of Unequal Childhoods was published in 2011, to which Lareau added over 100 pages. She traced the lives of the 12 children whose families were observed into adulthood. With Elliot Weininger and Dalton Conley, she also reported national data on children's participation in organized activities which affirmed the findings of her ethnographic study. ==Other works== In 2014, Lareau published Choosing Homes, Choosing Schools, which she edited with Kimberly Goyette. The book was published by the Russell Sage Foundation. It reports on the results of a number of studies of how residential decisions facilitate the maintenance of social inequality. On the book's back cover, Sean Reardon, Professor of Sociology and Education at Stanford University called it \\"a 'must-read' for urban sociologists and educational policy makers interested in understanding modern American inequality, segregation, and educational opportunity\\". ==Awards== Lareau's first book, Home Advantage, won the Sociology of Education Award for Scholarship of the American Sociological Association. It also won the AESA Critic's Choice award from the American Educational Studies Association. For Unequal Childhoods, she won the Sociology of Culture Section Best Book Award as well as the William J. Goode Best Book Length Contribution to Family Sociology Award, both from the American Sociological Association.

The structure was completed in 1927 and was the first building on the current City Avenue campus known as Hawk Hill. The building is known for its 165-foot tower which has become a symbol of the University. It is often used as a secondary logo for SJU. For some time, the tower was the highest point from sea level in Philadelphia. The building is named for Felix-Joseph Barbelin who served two separate terms as president of what was then known as Saint Joseph's College. Constructed of Wissahickon schist (a local stone) and limestone, the facade features gargoyles, heads of early presidents of the college, and an array of other limestone carvings. The building was first used for all types of classes and as a residence hall. It is now exclusively used for the College of Arts & Sciences at Saint Joseph's. What is known as Barbelin Quad is located in the middle of the building. The tower overlooks the entire campus including Sweeney Field and the Haub School of Business in Mandeville Hall. A number of gargoyles can be seen on the building while on Barbelin Quad. Statues and grotesques of heads of former presidents of Saint Joseph's are also located on the edges of the building.https://web.archive.org/web/20091027154335/http://www.geocities.com/gargoyleppa/stjoes.html In front of Barbelin, overlooking City Avenue, is a statue of Saint Joseph. == References == Category:Saint Joseph's University Category:University and college buildings completed in 1927 Category:1927 establishments in Pennsylvania ","title":"Barbelin Hall"},{"id":"20192250","text":"Jungle Jim is a 1948 American adventure film directed by William Berke and starring Johnny Weissmuller. It is based on Alex Raymond's Jungle Jim comic strip and was distributed by Columbia Pictures. It is the first picture in the Jungle Jim series that consists of 16 films originally released between 1948 and 1955. In 1954, Columbia turned over its Jungle Jim rights to its television subsidiary, and in the last three films of the motion picture series Weissmuller's character was referred to as \\"Johnny Weissmuller\\" instead of Jungle Jim. Devil Goddess (1955) was the last entry in the series, as well as being Weissmuller's last feature film.http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/79999/Jungle-Jim/notes.html ==Plot== After attempting in vain to save a man from being mauled to death by a leopard, Jungle Jim discovers a vial containing an unknown potion. He takes it to district commissioner Marsden, who identifies it as being from the hidden temple of Zimbalu and brings in Dr. Hilary Parker to head up an expedition with Jim as her guide. An opportunistic photographer, Bruce Edwards, follows as Dr. Parker seeks what she believes could be a miraculous breakthrough in medicine. Jim is more concerned that witch doctors use what's in the vial as a deadly poison. His trusty ally Kolu comes along and saves Jim when he is pushed off a cliff by Edwards. The favor is returned when Jim rescues Kolu from an attacking lion. Accidents befall the expedition along the way, as Edwards ingratiates himself with the \\"devil doctors\\", only to later incur their wrath. The potion isn't the polio vaccine Hilary hoped it would be, but she expresses a willingness to work again with Jim in future adventures in the jungle. ==Cast== * Johnny Weissmuller as Jungle Jim * Virginia Grey as Dr. Hilary Parker * George Reeves as Bruce Edwards * Lita Baron as Zia * Rick Vallin as Kolu ‚Äì Chief of the Masai * Holmes Herbert as Commissioner Geoffrey Marsden ==Production== The Jungle Jim comics had already been turned into a radio series in 1935 and a film serial two years later. Weissmuller had appeared in Tarzan movies since 1932 but in the late 1940s his contract with producer Sol Lesser was about to expire. In February 1948 producer Sam Katzman had signed a five-year deal with Johnny Weissmuller to make \\"jungle movies\\" starting with two films a year for two years where the budgets would be at least $350,000. Hedda Hopper reported that these would be an adaptation of the Jungle Jim or King of the Jungle comic strips. William Berke would direct the films. Initially it was thought there was still a chance Weissmuller might continue as Tarzan as well, but by April 1948 Lex Barker had signed to take over that role and Katzman announced Weissmuller would make Jungle Jim. Weissmuller dropped out of Tarzan in part because he had been putting on too much weight. Katzman had a penalty clause in his contract with the actor that insisted Weissmuller had to weigh in at 190 pounds or less, or be penalised $5,000 a pound up to ten pounds, or $50,000. The actor's fee was $75,000. \\"If he can't take it off by exercise he takes it off by worry\\", said Katzman. Filming started on August 3. Weissmuller would make two films a year for five years. Virginia Grey was cast as female lead shortly before filming commenced. ==Reception== The Los Angeles Times called it \\"pretty much formula stuff but most kids and some grownups will like it.\\" The New York Times said Weissmuller played \\"a fat, but physically fearless, and miraculously clever jungle guide... foiling witch doctors and white villains much as he's done of old\\" but added \\"it's not quite the same old Johnny. And that perceptible rubber tire which shows around his middle when he goes in swimming is not the only evidence of age. A heavy accretion of boredom is in his attitude... maybe it's too much dialogue.\\" Variety said \\"while filling its purpose satisfactorily for the kiddie field producers might have attracted a broader market had they given it more adult intent.\\" ==The Jungle Jim feature film series== #Jungle Jim (1948) #The Lost Tribe (1949) #Mark of the Gorilla (1950) co-starring Onslow Stevens #Captive Girl (1950) co-starring Buster Crabbe #Pygmy Island (1950) #Fury of the Congo (1951) co-starring Lyle Talbot #Jungle Manhunt (1951) co-starring Lyle Talbot #Jungle Jim in the Forbidden Land (1952) #Voodoo Tiger (1952) #Savage Mutiny (1953) #Valley of Head Hunters (1953) #Killer Ape (1953) #Jungle Man-Eaters (1954) #Cannibal Attack (1954) #Jungle Moon Men (1955) co-starring Myron Healy #Devil Goddess (1955)http://www.tcm.turner.com/tcmdb/title/79999/Jungle-Jim/ ==See also== * Jungle Jim (disambiguation) * Jungle Jim (serial) * Jungle Jim (TV series) ==References* *Review of film at Variety Category:1948 films Category:1948 adventure films Category:English-language films Category:American films Category:Columbia Pictures films Category:Films directed by William A.

It was harrowing work because of the thousands of dead, dismembered and rotting bodies. They worked close to danger areas, their stress increased by racial hostility within the army and from local residents. The Chinese were engaged when the Beiyang government agreed on 30 December 1916 to send 140,000 Chinese to work with the British. They were to be labourers rather than soldiers because China, not then part of the war,China declared war against Germany on 14 August 1917 would not send men to fight.Fawcett, Brian C., \\"The Chinese Labour Corps in France, 1917-1921\\", in Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society Hong Kong Branch, Volume 40, 2000, pp. 33-111 It saw sending men to work in docks and elsewhere as a commercial proposition without political intent.Contracting Chinese workers was pioneered by the French, whose military negotiators wore civilian clothes to avoid offending Chinese neutrality. ==Working conditions== The Belgian historian Dr Patrick Loodts said: \\"They found themselves behind the English lines in living conditions they certainly hadn't imagined! They were lodged in camps which they weren't allowed to leave,Historian Brian C. Fawcett said: \\"Because of the strict censorship, members of the Labour Companies were not allowed to mix with others outside their camps. This, in part, can be explained that some nationalities held animosity against others, e.g. the Indian Labour Corps was made up of many tribal groups; the Basutos and Zulus of the South African Native Labour Contingent [SANLC] were mutually hostile and the Chinese and the SANLC were cool towards each other. subjected to military discipline, carrying out the hard work needed to maintain the immense network of trenches.\\"http://www.1914-1918.be/resume_service_sante.php They were contracted to work seven days a week, ten hours a day, for three years. Their only days off were for Chinese national holidays.These were standard conditions in China and not thought exceptional by the Chinese. ==Trial== The Chinese were repatriated only in February 1920. From the end of the war on 11 November 1918 they remained in camp at De Clijte, near Poperinge, Belgium. They drank, they gambled,Oram, Gerard (1998), Worthless Men, Francis Boutle, UK, p109 they fought, they assaulted women, and they stole. Historian Brian C. Fawcett said: \\"Invariably gambling was rife and, on pay days, some debts could not be honoured. Fighting ensued and some killed their companions as a result, eventually paying the price by being shot at dawn.\\" Ten members of the corps were executed for murder. Wang Jungzhi killed another Chinese labourer in the camp in February 1919. He fled but was caught by military police on the French coast at Le Havre, where he was trying to find a ship. The police brought him back to Poperinge, where he was tried on 19 April 1919. He was shot at 4.24am on 8 May 1919. Records say he was executed in the courtyard of the town hall, but the researchers Piet Chielens and Julian Putkowski say it had been returned to civilian use by then. The execution pole on display in Poperinge is said to have been used only once, for Wang Jungzhi's execution.Fawcett, Brian C., \\"The Chinese Labour Corps in France, 1917-1921\\", in Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society Hong Kong Branch, Volume 40, 2000, p. 62 ==Burial place== Wang Jungzhi is buried in plot II.O.54 in the Old Military Cemetery in Poperinge.

The species of Enoploteuthisare most easily recognised by having a larger tail when compared to the other genera in the Enoploteuthidae. The tail's size is emphasised not having the fins extending along its sides. In related genera there is a narrow extension of the fins along the tail. Other characteristics include the presence of suckers on the distal portion of arms IV where there at no photophores present; the tentacular club has two rows of hooks and no marginal suckers; on the buccal crown there are typical chromatophores on the aboral surface but on the oral surface there may be some light skin pigmentation. They have 9-10 photophores on the eye and they have complex photophores in the skin. In the females the Spermatangia receptacles are at the posterior junction of muscles used to retract the funnel and the muscles which retract the head. Enoploteuthis differs from other genera of the Enoploteuthidae in having two rather than three types of photophores in its integument and these are on the ventral areas of the head, funnel and mantle. All species of Enoploteuthis which have been studied have the most complex type of photophoreand seems to be a distinctive characteristic of this genus. Enoploteuthis contains the largest species in the family, attaining a mantle length of 130mm. Enoploteuthis is a genus with a relatively high number of species and most of these have been described in the late 20th and early 21st Centuries. They have been collected during exploratory trawling in the mesopelagic zone. They are an important food source for fishes and toothed whales but they are of little commercial value, except for Enoploteuthis chunii which is caught as bycatch in the Japanese fishery for Watasenia scintillans. Many species are diel migrants, spending the day at depth and moving up the water column at night to feed. ==Species== The following valid species are currently recognised: *Enoploteuthis leptura (Leach, 1817) *Enoploteuthis magnoceani Nesis, 1982 *Enoploteuthis obliqua Burgess, 1982 *Enoploteuthis octolineata Burgess, 1982 *Enoploteuthis reticulata Rancurel, 1970 *Enoploteuthis anapsis Roper, 1964 *Enoploteuthis chunii Ishikawa, 1914 *Enoploteuthis galaxias Berry, 1918 *Enoploteuthis higginsi Burgess, 1982 *Enoploteuthis jonesi Burgess, 1982 *Enoploteuthis semilineata Alexeyev, 1994 These species are sometimes divided into two subgenera Enoploteuthis and Paraenoploteuthis. ==References== Category:Squid Category:Cephalopod genera Category:Bioluminescent molluscs ","title":"Enoploteuthis"},{"id":"20192276","text":"Pierwsza Dama of the Republic of Poland is an informal designation customarily applied to the wife of the president of the Republic of Poland (as so far all Polish presidents have been male).

It was later broadcast on NBC on February 26, 2009 and is now available as a separate DVD as of March 24, 2009. The film has a framing story of Po the Dragon Warrior (in computer animation) telling the stories of his comrades in arms, the Furious Five, which are depicted in 2D cel animation, similar to the opening and end credits of the original film. The only actors from the film to reprise their roles in this short were Jack Black as Po, Dustin Hoffman as Master Shifu, David Cross as Crane, and Randall Duk Kim as Master Oogway. Angelina Jolie, Lucy Liu, Jackie Chan and Seth Rogen do not reprise their roles mainly because their related characters are depicted as their younger selves. In this short, Monkey is voiced by Jaycee Chan, son of Jackie Chan. Jaycee Chan also voiced Crane in the Cantonese version of the original film. Production of the film was outsourced to Reel FX Creative Studios, who worked on CG animation, and to Film Roman, who worked on traditionally animated sequences. ==PlotIntroduction=== Po (Jack Black) is assigned by Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) to teach an introduction to Kung Fu class for a group of rambunctious bunny children. Po tries to explain to the kids that combat is not the only part of what Kung Fu is about, while its true meaning is \\"excellence of self.\\" To illustrate his point, he uses the stories of the Furious Five's individual pasts and the basic philosophical concepts they learned that enabled them to be great Kung Fu masters. ===Mantis=== In his youth, Mantis was a petulantly impatient warrior who was prone to jumping to conclusions and making impulsive decisions. When this habit got himself captured by crocodile bandits, the long wait he was forced to endure in his cage allowed him to find the patience to play dead long enough to ambush his captors. ===Viper=== Viper, the daughter of Great Master Viper, was born without venomous fangs. Her father, who relied on his venomous bite to protect the village, was despondent that she could never succeed him as a warrior, making her feel timid. One night during a festival, Great Master Viper encountered a gorilla bandit who wore armor hard enough to shatter his fangs when he tried to bite him. Seeing her father in peril, Viper found the courage to fight the bandit and defeat him with her ribbon dancing skills. ===Crane=== Crane was an unconfident janitor of a Kung Fu academy until the star pupil Mei Ling encouraged him to seek enrollment in the school. Even though his nerve failed him at the tryouts, Crane accidentally stumbled into the intimidating challenge that determined eligibility and suddenly found the confidence to take the challenge, with his skinny body proving to be an asset that enabled him to succeed. ===Tigress=== Tigress was an orphan whose status as an apex predator and her destructive lack of control of her strength left her feared and isolated in the rest of the orphanage where she lived. Master Shifu came to kindly teach her the discipline she desperately needed to control her movements until she could perform delicate tasks with ease enough to allay the concerns of the orphanage and the kids that lived there. When she was again rejected for adoption by the adults who were still scared of her, Master Shifu took her in as his student and foster daughter. ===Monkey=== Monkey was a troublemaker who tormented his village owing to him being publicly humiliated in his youth. He defied all attempts to force him to leave by removing his assailants' belts that held their pants up until Master Oogway confronted him and defeated him in a fight (since he wore no pants), deducing the cause of his anti-social behavior. Rather than making him leave the village as per the challenge, Oogway told him to stay and encouraged him to show compassion to others, as he would want in similar circumstances. ===Conclusion=== At the end, Master Shifu returns to see Po's anticipated lack of progress teaching and he's surprised that he underestimated Po's talents yet again, considering how much Po's students have learned. But when the bunnies ask Po how his first day of Kung Fu was, all the unpleasant memories during the original film flash through his head; he then proudly says, \\"It was totally awesome!\\" ==Voice cast== * Jack Black as Po * Dustin Hoffman as Shifu * David Cross as Crane * Randall Duk Kim as Oogway * Elizabeth Ann Bennett as Ant / Bunny * Jaycee Chan as Young Monkey * Jim Cummings as Instructor * Jessica DiCicco as Young Viper * John DiMaggio as Crocodile Bandit #1 / Gorilla Bandit * Carol Kane as Sheep * Stephanie Kearin as Crocodile Bandit #2 * Max Koch as Young Mantis * Stephanie Lemelin as Mei Ling * Meredith Scott Lynn as Master Viper's Mom * Tom Owens as Ladybug * Eamon Pirruccello as Impatient Bunny * Grace Rolek as Shy Bunny * Will Shadley as Nerdy Bunny * James Sie as Great Master Viper * Tara Strong as Young Tigress Note: Mr Ping didn't appear in the short, only on the DVD cover of the film. ==Awards== Secrets of the Furious Five has received eight nominations in the \\"Animated Television Production or Short Form\\" category at the 36th Annie Awards, of which it received four (\\"Character Animation,\\" \\"Character Design,\\" \\"Music,\\" and \\"Production Design\\"). ==ReferencesCategory:Kung Fu Panda films Category:2008 films Category:2008 animated films Category:2000s American animated films Category:2000s animated short films Category:2008 comedy films Category:American films Category:American animated short films Category:American sequel films Category:Animated films about orphans Category:2008 computer-animated films Category:DreamWorks Animation animated short films Category:English-language films Category:Films scored by Henry Jackman Category:Films scored by Hans Zimmer Category:Films scored by John Powell Category:Films directed by Raman Hui Category:Paramount Pictures animated films Category:Reel FX Creative Studios short films Category:Films with screenplays by Todd Berger Category:Wuxia films ","title":"Secrets of the Furious Five"},{"id":"20192576","text":"John Bigelow IV (born June 12, 2001), also known as \\"Fore\\", is a golf prodigy from North Philadelphia.

He achieved a degree of unwanted prominence through the Combe-Ivanov affair of 1983. ==Early life== Harvey David Mathew Combe was born in 1943 in Adelaide, South Australia, and was educated at Prince Alfred College and the University of Adelaide where he earned a BA. He became interested in politics at university and joined the ALP, partly through his friendship with Don Dunstan. (He became Patron of the Don Dunstan Foundation in 2004.) ==Career== Combe was National Secretary of the Australian Labor Party (1973‚Äì1981), a political consultant and lobbyist (1981‚Äì1985), and an Australian senior trade commissioner (1985‚Äì1991), and held senior executive and board positions within the Australian wine industry (1991‚Äì2008). ===Politics=== In 1973 Combe became the youngest-ever National Secretary of the Australian Labor Party after the election of the first Labor government for 23 years. In November 1975, he was allegedly the co-instigator, with Gough Whitlam and Bill Hartley, of an unsuccessful approach to Saddam Hussein's Iraq for a gift of $US 500,000 to help fund Labor's 1975 election campaign.Parkinson, Tony Shame, Whitlam, Shame The Age, 15 November 2005 However former Labor Party leader, Bill Hayden, later Governor-General of Australia, in his autobiography published in 1996, reflected the doubts held by some about the blame attached to Combe over the episode when he said that \\" ... it appeared that the national secretary of the Party, David Combe, was being left isolated as a scapegoat in this fanciful escapade.\\"Bill Hayden, 1996, \\"Hayden: An Autobiography\\", Sydney: HarperCollins, p. 305. In the event, Labor lost the 1975 election. In an article published in The Bulletin in January 1982 Combe suggested that Labor's defeat was partly due to the influence of the CIA. Combe remained National Secretary until July 1981, when he resigned to establish a lobbying business, David Combe and Associates Pty Ltd. The firm reportedly \\"received a great fillip in March 1983, when the Labor Party was re-elected to office. Business perceived Combe as the most influential lobbyist then working in Canberra.\\" Combe-Ivanov affair In 1983 Combe was accused of compromising Australia's national security in dealings with a Soviet diplomat, Valery Ivanov.Blesing, Meena.

The rest of the chapter discusses \\"ASIO and the Combe-Ivanov affair\\" and \\"Justice Hope's Royal Commission\\". The Combe-Ivanov affair developed out of a trip Combe and his wife made to the USSR in 1982, in the course of preparations for which they met and developed a relationship with Valery Ivanov, then the First Secretary at the Soviet Embassy in Canberra. Soon after the formation of the Hawke government ASIO raised concerns that Combe, closely aligned to the ALP, might be being compromised by a Soviet citizen with KGB links. Ivanov was expelled from Australia in 1983 by Prime Minister Bob Hawke. The highly publicised events were investigated by the Hope Royal Commission on Australia's security and intelligence agencies of 1983‚Äì1984. The commission found that Combe had indeed been targeted by the Soviets, but there was no proof of intelligence breaches or of any threat to national security.Pryor, Geoff, , National Library of Australia, retrieved 1 July 2015. Speaking after Combe died on 21 September 2019, former Hawke government minister and NSW Labor Party Secretary Graham Richardson said that Combe's death had saddened him and that \\"David make a big contribution and the whole Ivanov thing ... well, he got short-changed.\\"Troy Bramston and Simon Benson, 'Hawke, Russian Spies and sad goodbyes to David Combe', The Australian, 25 September 2019. Richardson said that the handling of the Ivanov affair \\"... was a massive overreaction ... but we had no experience in dealing with that ... we didn't know what to do.\\"Ibid. ===Trade commissioner=== Combe was later appointed as Australia's senior trade commissioner in Western Canada from 1985 to 1989, and in Hong Kong from 1990 to 1991. ===Wine industry=== Combe was Senior Vice- President International and ran the European operations of Penfolds and Southcorp Wines during the rise in popularity of Australian wines in the 1990s. He is credited with developing significant export markets for Southcorp Wines, whose exports increased in value from $A 40 million in August 1991 to $A 300 million in June 2000. In 2000 Combe was named Australia's Top Export Salesman by Overseas Trading magazine and was included in the list of \\"Twenty Five Most Influential Australians in Asia\\" published by Business Asia magazine.Speaker's profile: David Combe, at Claxton Speakers (undated) From March 2001 to November 2003 Combe was a non-executive director for the Western Australian wine producer Evans and Tate Limited. In 2004, in a speech at Bordeaux, he lambasted the wine-purchasing policies of UK supermarkets, which, he said, \\"if committed in Australia, would represent major breaches of the trade practices laws\\".Erhlich, R My Round: State of Independence The Independent, London, 11 April 2004 In June 2004 he was appointed Chairman of Simon Gilbert Wines, He retired as a director and chairman in February 2007, \\"to take up another position within the wine industry\\".Simon Gilbert Wines board statement , 14 February 2007. ==Portrait== In 1983, Keith Looby painted Combe's portrait. The portrait was an unsuccessful entry in the Archibald Prize of 1983, and conspiracy theories on this matter abound. David Combe said in 1998 that there was 'circumstantially a good case to believe that some trustees were heavied by the Party' into rejecting the work.David Combe and the portrait, National Portrait Gallery, Canberra In 1998, Combe donated his portrait to the collection of the National Portrait Gallery in Canberra, \\"through the Australian Government's Cultural Gifts Program\\". ==Death== Combe died on 21 September 2019, aged 76.Bramston and Benson, op. cit. The national president of the Labor Party, former deputy prime minister of Australia Wayne Swan, paid tribute to Combe saying that as national secretary of the party, he had \\"revolutionised the party's conferences, turning them from concealed and private affairs into public events which are now the largest political gatherings in Australia.\\"Wayne Swan, 'Vale David Combe (1943-2019)', Labor Party website, accessed 29 September 2019. His friend Richard Whitington, in an affectionate obituary, said that \\"the twists and turns in David Combe's life and career demanded courage and resilience of him and he displayed those qualities consistently and in abundance.\\" Talking of Combe's work with the Labor Party, Whitington observed that, \\"He was a product of the Labor movement and a servant to it, motivated by strongly held beliefs in individual rights and Australia's potential as a more caring, compassionate and independent nation.\\"Richard Whitington, 'Much more to Labor servant than probe over links to Russian agent', Sydney Morning Herald 30 September 2019.

Since then it has been extensively used by many researchers to solve different kinds of fluid flow and heat transfer problems. Many popular books on computational fluid dynamics discuss the SIMPLE algorithm in detail.

As a cultural category with its sets of associated practices hygge has more or less the same meanings in Danish and Norwegian, but the notion is more central in Denmark than in Norway. The emphasis on hygge as a core part of Danish culture is a recent phenomenon, dating to the late 20th century. 222x222px == Etymology == The word hygge comes from a Danish word meaning \\"to give courage, comfort, joy\\". Hygge stems from hyggja which means to think in Old Norse. Hygge is built from the Old Norse word hugr which later became the hug which means the soul, mind, consciousness. But it is also speculated that hygge might originate from the word hug. Hug comes from the 1560s word hugge, which means \\"to embrace\\". The word hugge is of unknown origin but is highly associated with an Old Norse term, hygga, which means \\"to comfort\\", which comes from the word hugr, meaning \\"mood\\". In turn, the word comes from the Germanic word hugyan, which is a cognate of the Old English hycgan, meaning \\"to think, consider\\". It first appeared in Danish writing in the 19th century and has since evolved into the cultural idea known in Denmark and Norway today. While hygge has exactly the same meaning in Norwegian as in Danish and is a widely used word in both Norway and Denmark (including in its derived forms, such as hyggelig), the emphasis specifically on \\"hygge\\" as an important part of their cultural identity is mostly a recent Danish phenomenon; in Norway \\"hygge\\" is just a word, similar in status to \\"cozy\\" in English-speaking countries. == Use == In both Danish and Norwegian, hygge refers to \\"a form of everyday togetherness\\", \\"a pleasant and highly valued everyday experience of safety, equality, personal wholeness and a spontaneous social flow\\".Interweavings ‚Äì A cultural phenomenology of everyday consumption and social atmosphere within Danish middle-class families, Jeppe Trolle Linnet, 2010 The noun hygge includes something nice, cozy, safe and known, referring to a psychological state.Hjalmar Falk og Alf Torp (1903): Etymologisk ordbog over det norske og det danske sprog.

Collins English Dictionary defines the word as \\"a concept, originating in Denmark, of creating cosy and convivial atmospheres that promote wellbeing.\\" == In popular culture == Collins English Dictionary named hygge the runner-up (after \\"Brexit\\") as word of the year in the UK in 2016. This followed a period during which several books focusing on hygge had been marketed in the UK, such as The Little Book of Hygge by Meik Wiking, Hygge: The Danish Art of Happiness by Marie Tourell S√∏derberg, and The Book of Hygge: The Danish Art of Living Well by Louisa Thomsen Brits. The concept of Hygge gained popularity with an international audience in late 2017, resulting in an increase of online searches and the rise of the hashtag Hygge on Instagram. In Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark, you can even go on a Hygge & Happiness walking tour. In the Broadway musical Frozen, there is a song called ‚ÄòHygge‚Äô, which is all about being comfortable, happy, and together. In Australian soap opera Neighbours, Jemima Davies-Smythe incorporates hygge into a redesign of her half-brother Karl Kennedy's living room. == Similar words == * The Dutch word gezelligheid has a similar concept to hygge with both pertaining to comfort and cosiness, but is often more socially oriented. * In German Gem√ºtlichkeit means the state of warmth, friendliness and belonging. * The Norwegian adjective koselig is used to describe a feeling of warmth, intimacy and getting together in an agreeable environment. * The Swedish adjective mysig (and its associated noun mys) describes a pleasant and warm atmosphere of togetherness in a pleasant setting. * The Japanese adjective/verb mattari has a similar meaning to be/have a comfortable, calm and pleasant time, but it is also applicable to a situation being alone. == See also == * Happiness * Safety ==References *http://www.hyggevita.com *The Guardian: The hygge conspiracy *Hyggeligt Moment *Because Hygge is a place Category:Feeling Category:Pleasure Category:Happiness Category:Emotion Category:Danish culture Category:Norwegian culture Category:Danish words and phrases Category:Norwegian words and phrases Category:Words and phrases with no direct English translation Category:Sociological terminology Category:Mental states ","title":"Hygge"},{"id":"20192651","text":"Eugene Ball (born 12 October 1972) is an Australian jazz trumpeter.

It was purchased new from the American Locomotive Company (ALCO) in 1925. Shortly after retirement, on July 3, 1955, the 25 ceremoniously opened the Burney Branch by bursting through a paper banner with a special excursion train. In 1962, No. 25 was restored for excursion service and served in that capacity until passenger service was once again terminated in 1975. It has since been used in the films Bound For Glory, Stand By Me and Changeling and is presently in Oregon, providing excursion service on the Oregon Coast Scenic Railroad. ==Service history== The 25 was one of four Prairies from ALCO, numbered 22‚Äì25, which were purchased for a total cost of $90,000. The 25 was the largest and last steam locomotive purchased by the McCloud River Railroad. At the time, the McCloud was a logging railway and the 25 was used in this function until June 1955, when it was replaced by GE 70-ton switcher No. 1. ===Post-retirement excursions=== It wasn't long, however, before the locomotive was brought out again on July 3, 1955 to open the Burney Branch by breaking a paper banner with a special excursion train. After this, however, the locomotive was truly retired, but it remained on the property‚Äîthe only steam locomotive to do so. In the following years, there were many requests for the 25 to be restored for excursion service. This was finally done in 1962. The locomotive ran special excursions, usually for railfan organizations. A contractor called the Mt. Shasta Alpine Scenic Railway ran regular excursions in the summer of 1964, and another contractor called the Shasta Huffen-Puff ran the service between 1967 and 1971, when equipment prices, insurance prices, and falling interest. This era of excursions ended in 1975, when the locomotive travelled to the Tidewater Southern Railway to be used in Bound for Glory. After that, it was retired for the second time. The McCloud River Railroad came under new ownership in 1977, and the new owners ordered President Bill Herndon to scrap the 25, but he resisted. ===Great Western Railroad Museum=== Beginning in late spring of 1982, the 25 was put on long-term lease to the Great Western Railroad Museum, which ran it on the McCloud in several annual excursions. This third career also ended with a performance in a movie: Stand by Me, filmed in 1986. Right after this, the Great Western Railroad Museum sued the McCloud River Railroad for Breach of Contract, and in the settlement, obtained possession of the locomotive. They did not do anything with it, however, keeping it in storage on the McCloud property. The renewed McCloud Railway re-obtained the 25 in January 1996 and began restoration efforts. The locomotive's fourth career began on Labor Day in 1997. No. 25 again returned to occasional excursion service, but in February 2001, McCloud Railway 18 reentered service, and after a doubleheader excursion, the 18 replaced the 25. The 25 was stored again, and it was restored once again between the summer of 2007 and the summer of 2008. It made two excursions for railfan groups on November 1 and 2, but because most of the McCloud Railway is being abandoned, the locomotive ran on its homerails for the last time, and was put up for sale. ===Oregon Coast Scenic Railroad=== In late March, 2011, 25 was moved from McCloud, California to Tillamook, Oregon after it was purchased by the Oregon Coast Scenic Railroad. The locomotive is stored in the World War II-era blimp hangar and was steamed up on May 20 with passenger excursions planned to begin in the summer. It was moved to the Oregon Coast Scenic Railroad shop in Garibaldi, Oregon in July 2011 and is still in service as of 2020. ==References Category:2-6-2 locomotives Category:ALCO locomotives Category:Preserved steam locomotives of the United States Category:Individual locomotives of the United States Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1925 Category:Standard gauge locomotives of the United States ","title":"McCloud Railway 25"},{"id":"20192695","text":"The Crocodile is a Cambodian award-winning Horror action film based on the crocodile's influence in Khmer culture.

At around 7000 km2, the seat covers the industrial city of Port Pirie and surrounding agricultural areas including Clare. A by-election was held for the South Australian House of Assembly seat of Frome on 17 January 2009. This was triggered by the resignation of former Premier and state Liberal MHA Rob Kerin. The seat had been retained by the Liberals at the 2006 state election on a 3.4 per cent margin, and at the 2002 state election on an 11.5 per cent margin. The writ for the by-election was issued on 28 November, with the rolls closing on 8 December. Candidate nominations closed 18 December at midday. Independent candidate Geoff Brock ended up winning the seat from the Liberals in a very close contest. ==Background== Kerin was first elected as the member for the new rural Port Pirie-based seat of Frome at the 1993 state election where the Liberals won government. From 1995 he held various ministries in the Brown and Olsen Liberal governments until he became Premier of South Australia in October 2001, before losing government to the Mike Rann-led Labor Party at the March 2002 state election. Kerin remained Liberal leader until after the 2006 state election when he resigned the leadership to make way for Iain Evans. The state by-election was the first to be held since the 1994 Taylor by-election, when another former Premier, Lynn Arnold, retired from politics. ==Candidates== {  ! colspan=4  6 candidates in ballot paper order -    Labor Party  John Rohde  Postal worker. -    Nationals SA  Neville Wilson  Deputy mayor of Port Pirie Regional Council. -    Liberal Party  Terry Boylan  Police officer. -    Greens  Joy O'Brien  Former librarian and Burnside councillor. -    One Nation  Peter Fitzpatrick  Small business contractor. -    Independent Your Voice  Geoff Brock  Mayor of Port Pirie Regional Council. } The Family First Party and the Australian Democrats, who ran candidates in the previous election, polling 5.2 percent and 2 percent respectively, did not nominate a candidate to contest the by-election. ==Issues== Of concern to the electorate was the potential closure of the Nyrstar smelter in Port Pirie due to the federal government's emissions trading scheme known as the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, however it won special exemption from the scheme on 17 December.Smelter 'safe' - Premier: Fairfax 18/12/2008 Port Pirie Mayor and Independent candidate Geoff Brock was considered a possibility for winning the seat, with a strong local profile, and receiving preference recommendations in how-to-vote cards (HTVs) from Labor and the Nationals, whilst the Greens did not recommend preferences. Brock's own HTV recommended preferences to the Nationals, Labor, Liberal, Green, and One Nation, in that order. Independent Senator Nick Xenophon also campaigned for Brock. ==Results== The by-election was closely contested, with the result being uncertain for over a week. Initial reports suggested a slight swing to the Liberals on the two-party preferred count against Labor, but with Independent candidate Geoff Brock not far behind Labor. By 21 January 2009, both the ABC's Antony Green and the State Electoral Office were indicating a two percent swing against the Liberals toward Labor, but not enough to lose the seat. Liberal leader Martin Hamilton-Smith claimed victory on behalf of the party. This article reproduces the original Liberal press release, no longer available on the SA Liberal site.

Brock polled best in the Port Pirie area, and received enough eliminated candidate preferences to end up ahead of the Labor candidate by 30 votes. Brock received 80 percent of Labor's fifth count preferences to achieve a two-candidate preferred vote of 51.72 percent (a majority of 665 votes) against the Liberals, despite a slight improvement in the Liberal primary vote since the previous count. This was announced by the Electoral Commissioner, Kay Mousley, at 8:30 pm local time on 24 January 2009, but without a formal declaration. The commissioner rejected a request for a recount by Boylan, with a formal request being lodged by the Liberals, which was also rejected, after which the Liberals ruled out a possibility of taking the result to the Court of Disputed Returns. A formal declaration of the by- election outcome was made by the State Electoral Office on 29 January. The by- election saw a rare two-party swing to an incumbent government, and was the first time an opposition had lost a seat at a by-election in South Australia. The result in Frome at the 2010 state election saw Brock increase his primary vote by 14.1 percent to a total of 37.7 percent and his two-candidate vote by 6.5 percent to a total of 58.2 percent. Despite a statewide swing against Labor at the election, Labor again increased its two-party vote in Frome by 1.8 percent to a total of 50.1 percent, coincidentally by 30 votes. ==See also== *List of South Australian House of Assembly by-elections ==External links== *An Example of Non-Monotonicity and Opportunities for Tactical Voting at an Australian Election: Antony Green ABC *2009 Frome by-election: ECSA *2009 Frome by-election: Antony Green ABC *William Bowe's \\"The Poll Bludger\\" 2009 Frome by-election pre-election discussion *William Bowe's \\"The Poll Bludger\\" 2009 Frome by-election post-election discussion ==References== Category:2009 elections in Australia Category:South Australian state by- elections Category:2000s in South Australia ","title":"2009 Frome state by-election"},{"id":"20192819","text":"Harold Davies Littler (1887 - 3 January 1948) was an Anglican priest and headmaster. ==Life== Littler was educated at Rossall School and Jesus College, Oxford, where he read Modern History and lived on Staircase III with Alwyn Williams (later Bishop of Durham) and \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\".

Metropolitan Jonah was the first convert to the Orthodox faith to have been elected as the primate of the OCA. On June 15, 2015, Metropolitan Jonah was released from the Orthodox Church in America in order for him to be accepted as a bishop of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia. ==Life== James Paffhausen was born in Chicago, Illinois, to James and Louise Paffhausen. He was baptized in the Episcopal Church at St. Chrysostom's Episcopal Church. He continued attending a parish of the Episcopal Church after his family relocated to La Jolla, California. It was not until age 18 that he began preparation for chrismation in a San Diego Orthodox parish of the Moscow Patriarchate. In 1978, he was received into the Orthodox Church at Our Lady of Kazan Church (Moscow Patriarchate) while studying at the University of California, San Diego. He later transferred to UC Santa Cruz and helped to establish an Orthodox Christian Fellowship chapter there. After graduation from UCSC, Paffhausen began graduate studies at St. Vladimir's Orthodox Theological Seminary, graduating in 1985 with an M.Div. In 1988 he earned an M.Th. in Dogmatic Theology. In 1989, he began doctoral studies at Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley, California. He interrupted his studies to spend a year in Russia, working for Russkiy Palomnik in the publishing arm of the Moscow Patriarchate. During his time in Russia, he was introduced to Russian spirituality and its particular form of monastic life. In this period, the Soviet Union was dissolved. He subsequently joined Valaam Monastery as a novice, coming under the spiritual direction of Archimandrite Pancratius (Zherdev), the monastery's abbot, now a titular bishop of Troitsk. While in Russia, Paffhausen was taken to see Fr. Pancratius' own spiritual father, Elder Cyril (Pavlov) of Trinity-St. Sergius Lavra to ask for advice in discerning his vocation. Elder Kyrill blessed him to become a hieromonk. In 1994, Paffhausen was ordained to the diaconate and priesthood. In the following year, he was tonsured a monastic at St Tikhon's Monastery, South Canaan, Pennsylvania, receiving the religious name Jonah after St. Jonah of Moscow. Hieromonk Jonah returned to his home state of California and was initially assigned as the priest of a mission parish, St Mary Magdalene of Merced, California. While serving there, he worked with Father Jon Magoulias of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America (GOA) parish in Modesto, California to establish a mission parish under the auspices of the OCA in the Sonora/Jamestown/Columbia area of California. This mission met in the historical Roman Catholic church of Saint Anna in the gold rush town of Columbia. Father Jonah worked to establish a mission parish in Chico, California. In the midst of these activities, his goal was to establish a monastic brotherhood. He was given the obedience to establish a monastery at the Saint Eugene's retreat at Point Reyes, California by his bishop, Tikhon (Fitzgerald). In late 1996, St. John of San Francisco Monastery was founded in Point Reyes. During his tenure as abbot, Fr. Jonah's monastic community grew to more than fifteen members, and the monastery soon moved to larger facilities in Manton. In this period, Fr. Jonah continued to work with mission parishes in Chico, Eureka, and Susanville, California, and in the Kona District, Hawaii. ==Episcopal elevation== In 2008, Fr. Jonah was elevated to the rank of archimandrite and sent from the monastery to take on the duties of being an auxiliary bishop for the Orthodox Church in America's Diocese of the South. In September of that year, he was officially elected to that position, and then on November 1 consecrated in Dallas as Bishop of Fort Worth, Texas led by Archbishop Dmitri (Royster), then locum tenens of the OCA's Metropolitan See. Eleven days later, on November 12, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Bishop Jonah was elected as Metropolitan of the Orthodox Church in America. Jonah's election as Metropolitan was an extraordinary occurrence in the history of the OCA, as he was the newest bishop in the OCA at the time. Metropolitan Herman (Swaiko) had retired three months prior to the OCA's Fifteenth All-American Council, in connection with the 2005-08 financial scandal in the Orthodox Church in America. The vacancy meant that a new Metropolitan would have to be elected at the Council. On the night before the election, the Synod asked Jonah to address questions from the delegates regarding the recent financial scandal in the OCA. Jonah was only an auxiliary bishop at the time, and that for only ten days, but he was the only bishop at the time who was seen as untainted by the scandal. In his largely-improvised address, Jonah heavily criticized how he had seen authority exercised by bishops and the OCA administration in the past. He stated that hierarchical authority in the Orthodox Church should be about responsibility, accountability, and spiritual fatherhood, rather than \\"imperial aristocracy\\". He said that there had been a catastrophic leadership failure in the OCA, but told the assembly that clinging to bitterness over the situation would only do further harm, and that church members had to learn to forgive in order to heal. The following morning, Jonah received the most votes from the council delegates in two rounds of voting, and was subsequently elected by the Holy Synod to be the new Metropolitan. Metropolitan Jonah was formally installed as bishop of the Orthodox Church in America Diocese of Washington and New York at St. Nicholas Cathedral, Washington, D.C., on December 28, 2008. Several months later, the Synod voted to restore a previous arrangement of having Washington as the principal city of the Metropolitan's diocese, and establishing New York as a separate diocese, renaming the diocese the Orthodox Church in America Archdiocese of Washington. Jonah served as the locum tenens of New York until the Orthodox Church in America Diocese of New York and New Jersey enthroned its own bishop in 2010. In accordance with Orthodox canon law and the OCA Statute, which stipulate that a diocesan bishop must live within the geographic boundaries of his diocese, Jonah maintained his residence and office in Washington, D.C., while regularly working at the OCA headquarters in Oyster Bay Cove, New York. ==Activities== In November 2009, Jonah signed an ecumenical statement known as the Manhattan Declaration calling on evangelicals, Roman Catholics and Orthodox not to comply with rules and laws permitting abortion, same-sex marriage and other matters that go against their religious consciences. Regarding ecumenical relations with non-Orthodox jurisdictions and Christian denominations, Jonah severed contacts with The Episcopal Church, due to their acceptance of same-sex relationships, turning to support the Anglican Church in North America (ACNA). He also expressed a desire to establish full communion between the OCA and the ACNA. Jonah supported the creation of the ACNA, addressing his assembly in 2009. Jonah let it be known that he expected his bishops to be present at the annual March for Life each January in Washington, DC. He publicly threatened to pull some 26 OCA military chaplains out of the American military if they were asked to officiate at same-sex marriages or condone homosexuality in any way. He made some statements critical of fellow Orthodox leaders and made it known he wanted to permanently move church headquarters from Oyster Bay Cove, New York to Washington, DC. While some Orthodox applauded his proposed changes, others objected over what they considered to be rash and intemperate remarks. Other OCA leaders forced Jonah to take a retreat ostensibly for spiritual and personal renewal from February 25 to April 24, 2011. Archbishop Nathaniel of Detroit assisted in temporary administration of the OCA during Jonah's retreat. In 2011 and extending into 2012, Jonah presided at or participated in several events of historical significance in the Orthodox Church. These included a February 2011 concelebration with Metropolitan Hilarion (Alfeyev) of Volokolamsk and Archbishop Justinian (Ovchinnikov) of Naro-Fominsk in St. Nicholas Cathedral in New York City. In that same month, Jonah also met Metropolitan Christopher of the Czech Lands and Slovakia, as well as Patriarch Irinej of the Serbian Orthodox Church. In May and December 2011, Jonah concelebrated with Metropolitan Hilarion (Kapral) of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia (ROCOR). These were the first concelebrations between hierarchs of the OCA and ROCOR. The May Divine Liturgy was the first concelebration between the Primate and First Hierarch of the respective churches, and the December liturgy involved many more bishops from both Synods. In August 2011, Jonah was to have travelled to Prague to visit the Orthodox Church of the Czech Lands and Slovakia, but cancelled his portion of the trip in order to tend to the dying Archbishop Dmitri (Royster) of Dallas. Bishop Benjamin (Peterson), who was to have accompanied Jonah, traveled to Prague in his stead. Also in August 2011, Jonah's first book was published by St. Vladimir's Seminary Press. Titled Reflections on a Spiritual Journey, the book is a collection of several of Jonah's writings, speeches, and interviews, both from his time as abbot and mission priest as well as after his election as Metropolitan. On January 1, 2012, he presided at the Divine Liturgy at a ROCOR parish, St. John the Baptist in Washington, DC, with the blessing of Metropolitan Hilarion (Kapral). This was the first time an OCA bishop had led Divine Liturgy at a ROCOR parish, in the absence of any ROCOR bishops. Several OCA and ROCOR priests concelebrated on this historic occasion. ==Resignation== On July 6, 2012, Jonah tendered his resignation as Primate of the Orthodox Church in America. A later statement released by the OCA's Synod of Bishops claimed that their request that he either resign or take a leave of absence for treatment \\"came at the end of a rather long list of questionable, unilateral decisions and actions, demonstrating the Metropolitan's inability to be truthful and accountable to his peers.\\" The statement also alleged that Jonah had interfered with the proper investigation of multiple complaints of clerical sexual misconduct. The Synod's allegations were subsequently disputed for apparent internal inconsistency, witness testimony that contradicted the allegations, use of language that was apparently misleading and could have distorted press coverage of the event, as well as the allegations' apparent inconsistency with other OCA investigations and their conclusions. The accusatory statement no longer appears on the OCA website as of 8 December 2015. Jonah and his legal representative engaged in negotiations with the OCA for several months, beginning sometime before November 9, 2012. These negotiations eventually resulted in an agreement with the Holy Synod of the OCA regarding his retirement on May 27, 2013, during a meeting at St. Tikhon's Monastery with Jonah's future successor, then-Archbishop Tikhon, the current primate of the OCA, and other Synod members. On June 15, 2015, Metropolitan Jonah was released from the Orthodox Church in America in order for him to be accepted as a bishop of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia. ==Bibliography== * Reflections on a Spiritual Journey (Orthodox Profiles V. 1), SVS Press, 2011. ==References * An Open Letter to the Orthodox Church of America.

It lies between Agadir to the north and Sidi Ifni to the south and its centre is at 9¬∞40'W 30¬∞5'N. The estuary of the Oued Souss is the northern limit of the park, and that of the Oued Massa is near the southern end. 30,000 ha of land near Aglou, south of the park, is also included in the site because it is sometimes used as a feeding area by the northern bald ibis. The habitat is grazed steppe with dunes, beaches and wetlands. The soil is mainly sandy with some rockier areas. ==Fauna== The park's main conservation importance is that it holds three of the four Moroccan colonies of the northern bald ibis (Geronticus eremita). Together with the fourth site at nearby Tamri, it holds 95% of the world's truly wild breeding birds of this endangered species. Database entry includes a range map and justification for why this species is critically endangered The ibis colonies and roost-sites are located on coastal cliffs within the National Park, and the coastal steppes and fields are used as feeding areas. The park has a nature trail at Oued Souss and a visitor centre at Oued Massa. Northern bald ibis The Oued Massa holds water throughout the year and has breeding marbled ducks, a globally threatened species. Database entry includes a range map and justification for why this species is vulnerable. It is the only known Moroccan breeding site for the glossy ibis. The two estuaries are important for migrants, especially waders and gulls. European spoonbill and Audouin's gull winter in the park. Other notable breeding bird species are red-necked nightjar, thick-billed lark, Tristram's warbler and Moussier's redstart. Souss-Massa also holds captive-breeding programmes for four threatened North African ungulates: scimitar oryx, addax, dama gazelle and dorcas gazelle, that are kept in separate enclosures within the park. The reintroduction of the North African ostrich - which is extinct north of the Sahara - is also underway. ==Threats== The park is threatened by increasing pressures of the growing human population and the construction of summer chalets is increasing around Aglou. A large-scale hotel development planned for the coast at Tifnit, an area that includes important feeding areas for the bald ibis, has been suspended. ==International cooperation== In regard to international cooperation and exchanges, the Souss-Massa National Park has received technical support from the Teide National Park (Tenerife, Spain).Cooperaci√≥n internacional entre parques nacionales Souss Massa national Park ==See also== *Massa River *Northern bald ibis *Souss Massa National Park ==References== Category:National parks of Morocco Category:Geography of Souss-Massa Category:Protected areas established in 1991 Category:Biosphere reserves of Morocco Category:Ramsar sites in Morocco Category:1991 establishments in Morocco ","title":"Souss-Massa National Park"},{"id":"20193016","text":"Luc Daniel Adamo Mat√©ta (born October 1949\\"Mat√©ta Adamo Luc Daniel\\", Congo Brazzaville: Les Hommes de Pouvoir, number 1, Africa Intelligence, 29 October 2002 .) is a Congolese politician and the President of the Union for the Reconstruction and Development of the Congo (URDC).

As High Commissioner for Civic Instruction and Moral Education, Mat√©ta gave a talk on citizenship in the context of elections on 9 June 2009, shortly before the July 2009 presidential election. He noted the importance of exercising one's right to vote, behaving peacefully and responsibly while voting, and waiting for the announcement of results in a disciplined manner. While some opposition groups planned to boycott the election, Mat√©ta stressed that participating in the election was a crucial civic responsibility: \\"abstention is an act of insubordination to the laws of the Republic, that is to say insubordination to democracy and the sovereignty of the people.

The United States Senate Intelligence Committee's report on the CIA's use of torture confirmed that al Bihani had been held in the Central Intelligence Agency's network of black sites, where he had been subjected to torture. Al-Bihani arrived at Guantanamo on February 7, 2003, and has been held there, without charge, for . ==Publication of captives' CSR Tribunal documents== In September 2007 the Department of Justice published dossiers of unclassified documents arising from the Combatant Status Review Tribunals of 179 captives. Toffiq Nassar Ahmed Al Bihani had a writ of habeas corpus filed on his behalf, but the Department of Defense did not publish it with the others. ==Military Commissions Act== The Military Commissions Act of 2006 mandated that Guantanamo captives were no longer entitled to access the US civil justice system, so all outstanding habeas corpus petitions were stayed. ==Boumediene v. Bush== On June 12, 2008, the United States Supreme Court ruled, in Boumediene v. Bush, that the Military Commissions Act could not remove the right for Guantanamo captives to access the US Federal Court system. And all previous Guantanamo captives' habeas petitions were eligible to be re-instated. The judges considering the captives' habeas petitions would be considering whether the evidence used to compile the allegations the men and boys were enemy combatants justified a classification of \\"enemy combatant\\". ==Protective order== On July 15, 2008, Kristine A. Huskey filed a \\"NOTICE OF PETITIONERS‚Äô REQUEST FOR 30-DAYS NOTICE OF TRANSFER\\" on behalf of Toffiq Nassar Ahmed Al Bihani and several dozen captives. The petition would prevent the Department of Defense from transferring him out of US jurisdiction without giving his attorney's thirty days notice. The Department of Defense had transferred some captives to countries where they were subsequently subjected to abusive treatment‚Äîeven though they had active habeas corpus petitions. ==Habeas timeline== George M. Clarke III swore a declaration on September 9, 2008, stating that Toffiq's brother Adnan Al Bihani, serving as \\"next friend\\" initiated the habeas corpus process, in a letter dated June 17, 2005. Clarke and other attorneys formally filed the petition on December 14, 2005. Toffiq had initially declined to sign a form authoring Clarke to serve as his counsel in 2005. However, when Clarke was able to meet with him on March 28, 2007, Toffiq verbally authorized him to serve as his counsel, and he followed up that verbal authorization with a letter authorizing him to serve as counsel. ==Named by the US Senate as one of the CIA's captives subjected to torture, without authorization== On December 9, 2014, the United States Senate Intelligence Committee published the 600 page unclassified summary of a 6,000 page report on the CIA's use of torture. While some of the CIA's captives were identified as only been subjected to torture that had been authorized from Washington, other captives, like Bihani, were identified as having been tortured by CIA officials who did not have authorization. According to the Intelligence Committee, Bihani was \\"subjected to 72 hours of sleep deprivation between his arrival at detention site Cobalt and his October 2002, interrogation.\\" ==Reports his brother was killed fighting in Somalia== The Long War Journal reported that a martyrship video from Abu 'Asim al Tabuki Mansour Nasser al Bihani was published in November 2011. It reported that this individual had fought in Chechnya, lived in Afghanistan, until the fall of the Taliban, had been captured in Saudi Arabia, transferred to Yemen, where he escaped from Prison, and finally travelled to Somalia, where he died fighting for jihadists. It reported he had two brothers in Guantanamo. ==Status during the Donald Trump administration== Observers noted that President Barack Obama's administration made a push to transfer as many individuals from Guantanamo, as possible, during his last year. The Washington Post reported that Tawfiq Nisar al-Bihani was one of the five individuals who had been cleared for release, who remained in Guantanamo when Donald Trump was inaugurated. During the election campaign Trump had promised that, once he took power, no one would ever leave detention at Guantanamo, that he would bring more individuals to be detained there. ==See also== * Torture ==References * Judge Denies Guant√°namo Prisoner‚Äôs Habeas Petition, Ignores Torture in Secret CIA Prisons Andy Worthington *Under the U.S. Supreme Court: I'm not a terrorist; I'm just the piano player UPI, May 29, 2011 Category:Saudi Arabian extrajudicial prisoners of the United States Category:Living people Category:1972 births Category:Detainees of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp Category:Bagram Theater Internment Facility detainees ","title":"Tolfiq Nassar Ahmed Al Bihani"},{"id":"20193038","text":"The Greek Handball Cup is the second more important competition of Greek handball.

A formally trained photographer, Volcano's work includes installation, performance and film and interrogates the performance of gender on several levels, especially the performance of masculinity and femininity. == Identity == Born intersex, Volcano developed both male and female characteristics as an adolescent but was raised and socialized as female. Volcano continued to live the first 37 years of their life as a woman, but since then has been living as both male and female. Del LaGrace Volcano (formerly named Della Grace) continues to adopt their true self through their name and gender. After marrying a queer man, Johnny Volcano, Del took on their current name to challenge the \\"bi-gendered status quo.\\" Johnny has now changed his name while Del kept the surname and passed it on to their two children, Mika and Nico. Del has been in a partnership with the children's mother, Matilda Wurm since 2006. to which Del refers to themself as a \\"MaPa\\". ==Life and career== Prior to moving to San Francisco when they were nineteen, Volcano attended Allan Hancock College as a student in the Visual Studies program from 1977-79.Wilton, Tamsin. glbtq: An Encyclopedia of Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Culture. Chicago: glbtq, inc, 2002\\"Grace, Della\\" Volcano earned an MA in Photographic Studies at University of Derby, UK in 1992 after studying photography at the San Francisco Art Institute from 1979-81. Del LaGrace Volcano continues to further adopt their true self through their gender as well as their name. Volcano's work complicates understandings of both femininity and masculinity by depicting lesbian masculinity. In \\"The Feminine Principle\\" Volcano takes queer femininities as a focus; including in this project is a portrait of Kate Bornstein. In \\"Lesbian Boyz and Other Inverts,\\" Volcano's celebration of butch dykes, transsexual boys and other gender-queers. In the project, masculinity is shown as a tool of subversion. Volcano's recent photographs demonstrate how intersex bodies can offer an entirely new perspective on the body. The ‚Äúnormal‚Äù body in relation to Volcano's photographs becomes queer, describing the bodies in their latest works as \\"sites of mutation, loss, and longing.\\" In these newer works, Volcano takes on the loss of their friend, Kathy Acker and the transformation of their lover Simo Maronati's abled body into a disabled one. Here, Volcano illustrates the queerness of any body marked by illness or trauma. Their self-portrait \\"INTER*me\\" photograph series (formally the \\"Herm Body\\" series) is a raw rendition of the artist's body using black and white Polaroid film, in conversation with their previous work it speaks to the construction of different age-selves and the technologies of gender in photography. Volcano's artist statement of September 2005 reads: '''' Volcano also explores themes of both sexual and gender fluidity throughout their work. Volcano often depicts the instability of gender identity, by pushing past the binary gender system, and frequently uses their queerness in their work to contest the idea of sexual identity as something that is permanently embodied. As shown in Volcano's photography book, \\"Love Bites\\", Volcano presents various images of women at sexual play, dressed \\"in costumes ranging from brides to gay leather men\\". Volcano, in this way, seems to aim at defying conventional gender norms and feminist principles within their text. In \\"Teddy Boy David\\", Volcano further pushes this agenda and toys with the idea of age dynamics and, mainly, youthfulness in terms of sexuality and sexual play. === Selected Exhibitions=== * CORPUS QUEER: bodies in resistance, Transpalette, Emmetrop, Bourges, France September 2005 * INTERSEX 101: The Two Gender System as a Human Rights Abuse, NGBK gallery, Berlin, Germany June 2005 * A BOOST IN THE SHELL, Aeroplastics Gallery (Group Show) Brussels, Belgium May 2005 * PAS DE REGRETS, √¢ la Galerie du Forum des images, France November 2003 * FEMALE TURBULENCE, Aeroplastics Gallery, (Group Show) Brussels, Belgium October 2003 * VENUS BOYZ, Zita, Folkets Bio, Stockholm, Sweden May 2002 * FALLEN HEROES: Masculinity & Representation, Espai D'Art Contemporani de Castello, (Group Show) Cast√âleon, Spain April 2002 * FLUID FIRE, Format Gallery, Malmo 2002 * GERHKE'S ARTISTS, Hamburg Erotic Art Museum, 2001 * ONE MAN?

Maurer took office on 1 January 2009. ==Candidates== The Swiss People's Party (SVP/UDC), Switzerland's largest party by voter share but no longer represented in the Federal Council after the 2008 split-off of Schmid's Conservative Democratic Party (BDP), claimed Schmid's seat. The other governing parties including the BDP accepted the SVP's claim and declined to field candidates of their own.http://www.nzz.ch/nachrichten/schweiz/jetzt_werden_die_karten_neu_gemischt_1.1253915.html On 27 November 2008, the SVP's parliamentary group decided to nominate former Federal Councillor Christoph Blocher and former party president Ueli Maurer as candidates for Schmid's seat. Under new SVP party rules, any SVP member elected to the position without being nominated for it by the group would automatically lose his or her party membership. The opposition Green Party, citing their opposition to the SVP's policies and their representation on the Council, fielded State Councillor Luc Recordon as a candidate of their own. All governing parties declared Blocher to be unacceptable as Federal Councillor. The center-right Free Democrats (FDP/PRD) decided to support Maurer, while the center-left Social Democrats (SP/PS) announced that they would not elect him and were looking for an alternative SVP candidate. The centrist Christian Democrats (CVP/PDC) announced on 9 December 2008 that a narrow majority of their parliamentary group, 23 MPs, would vote for Maurerhttp://www.nzz.ch/nachrichten/schweiz/maurer_wird_von_cvp- fraktion_knapp_unterstuetzt__1.1387307.html ==Results== Prior to the first round, Hansj√∂rg Walter, an SVP councillor from Thurgau who had previously been rumored to be the favorite of the center-left parties, announced that he would not accept an election. He nonetheless received 109 votes. Following the first round, SVP group leader Caspar Baader announced that Christoph Blocher's candidacy was withdrawn in favor of Ueli Maurer. Green Party candidate Luc Recordon, who did not receive more than ten votes in the first round, declared that he would \\"suspend\\" his candidacy.

Kelly then began to play and record with a full-time band, which included Michael Armiger on bass guitar, Michael Barclay on drums, Steve Connolly on guitar, eventually bassist Jon Schofield, and keyboardist Peter Bull joined. Through a joke based on Lou Reed's song \\"Walk on the Wild Side\\", the band became known as Paul Kelly and the Coloured Girls. The line-up of the Coloured Girls changed rapidly with some stability late in 1985 as Barclay, Bull, Connolly and Schofield. In September 1986 Paul Kelly and the Coloured Girls released their debut album, Gossip. When released in North America and Europe by A&M; Records in July 1987, the band changed its name, for international releases, to Paul Kelly and the Messengers due to possible racist connotations. Subsequent releases were under the name Paul Kelly and the Coloured Girls for Australasia and Paul Kelly and the Messengers for international releases until 1989's So Much Water So Close to Home when all releases were by Paul Kelly and the Messengers until disbanding in 1991.

Earthquakes, floods, storms, and other natural hazards cause massive disruption to societies and overburden national economic systems. Considerable losses of life and property, however, could be avoided through better information about the risk and onset of disasters, improved risk assessment, early warning, and disaster monitoring. In recognition of these needs the United Nations General Assembly, in its resolution 61/110 of 14 December 2006, acknowledged that use of existing space technology, such as earth observation and meteorological satellites, communication and navigation satellites can play a major role in supporting disaster management by providing accurate and timely information for decision making. Space-based information is relevant in all phases of the disaster management cycle from disaster risk reductionUN-SPIDER March 2015 Newsletter: Space-based Information for Disaster Risk Reduction http://www.un- spider.org/news-and-events/newsletter/un-spider-newsletter-115-space-based- information-disaster-risk-reduction to disaster response and recovery.UN- SPIDER June 2013 Newsletter: Earth Observation for Disaster Response http://www.un-spider.org/sites/default/files/UN-SPIDER_NL_EO_online.pdf In March 2015, world leaders convened in Sendai, Japan to agree on a new global framework for disaster risk reduction for the period 2015 through 2030. The outcome document refers to the importance of Space-based and geospatial information in several paragraphs, highlighting, among others, the importance to \\"develop, update periodically and disseminate, as appropriate, location- based disaster risk information, including risk maps, to decision makers, the general public and communities at risk to disaster in an appropriate format by using, as applicable, geospatial information technology\\".Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 http://www.wcdrr.org/uploads/Sendai_Framework_for_Disaster_Risk_Reduction_2015-2030.pdf ==Organization and structure== United Nations, Vienna In its resolution 61/110 of 14 December 2006, the United Nations General Assembly agreed to establish UN-SPIDER as a new United Nations programme, with the following mission statement: \\"Ensure that all countries and international and regional organizations have access to and develop the capacity to use all types of space-based information to support the full disaster management cycle\\".Resolution 61/110 http://www.unoosa.org/pdf/gares/ARES_61_110E.pdf In doing so, UN-SPIDER aims at three goals: being a gateway to space information for disaster management support; serving as a bridge to connect the disaster management and space communities; and being a facilitator of capacity-building and institutional strengthening. UN-SPIDER has three offices in Vienna, Austria, in Bonn, Germany and in Beijing, China. The UN-SPIDER Vienna office is located at UNOOSA's headquarters in the Vienna International Centre. Its staff members are in charge of general UN-SPIDER coordination, fund-raising, Regional Support Office (RSO) coordination and Technical Advisory Support. The office is supported by the government of Austria. United Nations, Bonn The UN- SPIDER Bonn Office was established in October 2007 with the support from the German Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology (BMWi) and the German Aerospace Center (DLR). The UN-SPIDER Bonn Office is responsible for UN- SPIDER's knowledge management. The goal is to make sure that all relevant information is easily accessible and disseminated to all stakeholders in the areas of disaster management and emergency and humanitarian response. This is done mainly via UN-SPIDER's Knowledge Portal, which is managed by the Bonn staff. The Bonn Office is also dealing with Technical Advisory Support in Latin America and the Caribbean. The Beijing office opened on November 9, 2010, and is supported by the government of the People's Republic of China. The Beijing Office is mainly dealing with Technical Advisory Support in the Asia and Pacific region and the coordination of UN-SPIDER's network of National Focal Points. ==UN-SPIDER activitiesKnowledge Management=== The acquisition, processing and transfer of knowledge is the central element of UN-SPIDER's activities. A knowledge base on space-based information and solutions to support risk and disaster management are therefore made available through the UN-SPIDER Knowledge Portal.UN-SPIDER February 2013 Newsletter: Knowledge Management http://www.un-spider.org/sites/default/files/UN- SPIDER%20Newsletter%20Knowledge%20Management_online.pdf The UN-SPIDER Knowledge Portal is central to all knowledge management activities carried out within the framework of UN-SPIDER, as it provides the hosting environment and the dissemination tool for all resulting outputs and products. The Knowledge Portal went online in June 2009 and has continuously been improved and amended ever since. Its main tool is the Space Application Matrix, a sophisticated search engine to make available research papers and case studies on the application of different space-based resources in all phases of the disaster management cycle. The Portal also features the latest news from the disaster and risk management and the space communities, information on workshops, trainings and events as well as profile details on UN-SPIDER's network partners. UN-SPIDER's knowledge management activities are accompanied by its awareness-raising efforts. Since awareness-raising is a process by which the level of understanding among the persons targeted is raised, fostering change in attitudes and behaviour, it is central to the success of promoting the use of space-based information. In the framework of UN-SPIDER, awareness-raising is designed as an ongoing process accompanying, facilitating and preparing activities, as new audiences are addressed, new partnerships are formed and new technological solutions are developed, offering new opportunities for existing and new target groups. UN-SPIDER implements its awareness-raising activities mainly via its publications such as the monthly Updates and the biannual Newsletter as well as via its Knowledge Portal. ===Outreach=== Experience shows that the conduction of activities targeting the full disaster management cycle spans a variety of agencies from the public and the private sector, at different levels, and is best conducted through a coordinated approach. UN-SPIDER's outreach activities contribute to involving practitioners and experts from the disaster management and space communities in UN-SPIDER activities with the end-goal to promote the use of space-based information to support the full disaster management cycle. UN-SPIDER's outreach activities include the organization of workshops, seminars and expert meetings in all regions as well as the support to similar events organized by its partners. Furthermore, UN-SPIDER staff participates in relevant events all over the world to raise awareness about UN-SPIDER's activities and the opportunities that space-based information offers for disaster and risk management. ===Technical Advisory Support=== Technical Advisory Support (TAS) is one of the prime activities of the UN-SPIDER programme at the national level. It serves to identify the existing capacity to use space-based information, to analyze the institutional framework to support disaster management through space-based information and to identify the limitations that inhibit the use of such information. TAS attempts to enable Member States to overcome these limitations through international cooperation and regional opportunities, networking with regional institutions, and setting up disaster management plans. It covers region-specific aspects such as trans-boundary issues, emergency response, risk assessment, GIS-based disaster management systems, and disaster-risk reduction. TAS efforts range from a simple consultative phone call to the facilitation of technical support, missions, trainings and workshops. UN-SPIDER's TAS has three pilars: Technical Advisory Missions, Capacity Building and Facilitation of Emergency Support/Technical Support.UN-SPIDER May 2012 Newsletter: Technical Advisory Support http://www.un-spider.org/sites/default/files/UN- SPIDER%20Newsletter%20Technical%20Advisory%20Support.pdf Technical Advisory Missions (TAMs) are an instrument to identify the needs of Member States regarding their capacities to fully take advantage of space-based information. TAMs are officially requested by the respective national government and are conducted by a team of experts. The team meets with key disaster management and development authorities in the Government, United Nations organizations, regional and international organizations/initiatives and private entrepreneurs to discuss the topic in depth. It makes recommendations focusing on how to improve the access to and use of space-based information in risk and disaster management. Since 2008 various missions have been carried out to countries in Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, Asia and the Pacific region.UN-SPIDER's Technical Advisory Mission http://www.un-spider.org/advisory-support/advisory- missions UN-SPIDER defines its Capacity Building as the process of facilitating the strengthening of the competency of individuals, teams, and agencies to use space-based information to prevent, mitigate, and respond effectively to the challenges posed by natural hazards and related humanitarian crises. UN-SPIDER capacity building efforts include four complementary types of activities: Providing policy-relevant advice to institutions and governments regarding the use of space-based (spatial) information to support the full disaster management cycle, facilitating access to space-based data and services, facilitating the training of individuals on access to and use of such data and facilitating access to infrastructure, hardware, and software, and services for space-based applications. Therefore, UN-SPIDER's capacity building simultaneously aims at institutions, individuals and infrastructure.UN-SPIDER's training activities http://www.un- spider.org/advisory-support/training-activities In the case of emergencies and disasters, UN-SPIDER provides Emergency Support by taking the role of a bridge linking the disaster management agencies in charge of response operations with space agencies or the mechanisms which have been established by the space community such as the International Charter: Space and Major Disasters. UN- SPIDER provides this support through the activation of its network of Regional Support Offices (RSO) and through links with specific space agencies.UN- SPIDER's Emergency Support http://www.un-spider.org/advisory- support/emergency-support ==UN-SPIDER's network== UN-SPIDER created a global network in order to foster and strengthen strategic alliances and partnerships on a global and regional scale. There are two types of networks: Regional Support Offices (RSOs) and National Focal Points (NFP). ===Regional Support Offices=== A Regional Support Office is a regional or national center of expertise that is set up within an existing entity by a Member State.UN-SPIDER November 2014 Newsletter: Regional Support Offices http://www.un- spider.org/sites/default/files/Newsletter_online.pdf The establishment of a network of Regional Support Offices was agreed upon by the United Nations General Assembly in its Resolution 61/110. UN-SPIDER currently has Regional Support Offices in Algeria, Argentina, Japan, Colombia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Indonesia, Iran, Kenya, Mexico, Nepal, Nigeria, Norway, Pakistan, Panama, Romania, Russia, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Ukraine, and the West Indies. Detailed information on all UN-SPIDER Regional Support Offices can be found in the UN-SPIDER Knowledge Portal. Regional Support Offices communicate and coordinate with UN-SPIDER staff on regular basis, covering the three following realms: * Outreach and Capacity Building activities * Horizontal Cooperation (Communities of Practice, Knowledge Management, contributions to the Knowledge Portal) * Technical Advisory Support ===National Focal Points=== As defined by the United Nations General Assembly, a National Focal Point is a national institution, nominated by the government of the respective country, representing the disaster management and space applications communities. Among them are for example members of the space - or civil protection agencies. UN- SPIDER networks with all countries through the National Focal Points. A national Focal Point works with UN-SPIDER staff to achieve the following goals: * promoting access to and the use of space-based solutions for disaster management in the respective country * strengthening national disaster management planning and policies * implementing specific national activities that incorporate space-based technology solutions in support of disaster management ==Notes *UNOOSA *UN-SPIDER Knowledge Portal *Resolution 61/110 adopted by the General Assembly *About UN-SPIDER *UN-SPIDER publications Category:United Nations General Assembly subsidiary organs Category:Disaster management Category:Geographical technology Category:Remote sensing programs Category:United Nations organizations based in Vienna Category:Disaster preparedness ","title":"UN-SPIDER"},{"id":"20193207","text":"Sannati or Sannathi is a small village, located on the banks of the Bhima River in Chitapur taluk of Gulbarga District of Northern Karnataka. It is famous for the Chandrala Parameshwari Temple and the excavations by the Archaeological Survey of India done in 1986. ==Excavations== Edicts Of Ashoka In 1986, when the roof of the Kali temple in Chandralamba temple complex collapsed, it destroyed the idol. However it revealed four Ashokan edicts on the floor and foundation stone of the temple. These edicts were written in a Prakrit language and Brahmi script and one of them was used as foundation of the pedestal for the Kali idol. During subsequent excavations by Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) and the State Archaeology Department, tablets, sculptures, and other terracotta items were found, and most importantly numerous limestone panels of sculptures of the ruined 'Maha Stupa' or Adholoka Maha Chaitya (the Great Stupa of the Netherworld) were found. Archaeologists believe that Ranamandal was a fortified area, spread over , out of which only 2 acres had been excavated by 2009. Clay pendants, black polished pottery, Satavahana and pre-Satavahana coins, ornaments made of copper, ivory and iron, a township with paved pathways, houses, and limestone flooring have been found. Many excavated items were later shifted to Gulbarga Museum. The government has asked the Archaeological Survey of India to take up further exploration of the Ranamandal area to know the history of the region and its connection with Buddhism. One of the stones - the only known example of its type - is of Emperor Asoka (r. 274‚Äì232 BC) seated on his throne. It is probably the only surviving image of the emperor. In 2010, ASI along with Sannati Development Authority deputed Manipal Institute of Technology to prepare a blueprint for restoration and reconstruction of the stupas ==Mythological references== Ashoka with his Queen, at Sannati (Kanaganahalli Stupa), 1st-3rd century CE. The words \\"Raya Asoko\\" in Brahmi script inscribed on the relief identify king Ashoka as the subject matter. Sannati is the place where the Paduka of Goddess Chandrala Parmeshwari - Incarnation of Goddess Lakshmi - was brought. The Goddess came up to the banks of River Bhima at Hongunti, to save her devotee Chandravadani, wife of a rishi, held captive by the local king Setu Raya. Hingulambika temple is situated at Hongunti near Shabad town. The Goddess sent her Paduka from which emerged 5 bumblebees, which killed the evil king Setu Raya by drowning him in the Bhima River. Sannati Chandrala Parmeshwari and Hongunti Hingulambika are family deity of many Brahmin and Hindus families of Karnataka, Maharasta, AP etc. Sannati is also the place where Rishi Markandeya meditated and composed parts of Markandeya Upanishad. A small temple has been renovated at the place where he is believed to have sat in meditation. It is said that Rishi Markandeya predates the arrival of Paduka of Chandrala Parmeshwari. ==Visitors' attractions== Other places worth visiting nearby are: Yergol - where Tikacharya eloborated (key book) on works of Madwacharya, Malkhed- Brundavan of Sri Jayatheertharu (Tikachryaru); Hongunti; Konchur Hanuman Temple; Balavadagi yallamma (Renuka) temple; Halakatti Veerabhadreshwara temple; Martur - the place where Vignaneshwar edited and condensed Yagnavyalka Smriti, which was named Mitakshara - now known as Hindu Law. ==Transport== Sannati can be reached by rail via Nalwar Station or Wadi Junction. Some trains do not stop at Nalwar. All trains stop at Wadi Junction. Wadi to Nalwar fare by bus is Rs.15/- Nalwar to Sannati is about Rs.20/- by bus, and Rs.25 by sharing autos. Whole auto can be hired at Rs.300/- max. Sannati can also be reached via Shahapur by car. About 10 rooms are presently available at Sannati. BSNL, JIO and Airtel Mobile networks work well, and two small canteens meet the needs of visitors. Carry mosquito repellent creams - electricity is erratic and rooms are not well ventilated. ==Kanaganahalli== Kanaganahalli is 3 km from Sannati, which is also on the banks of the river Bhima.

Edwards created the Motown Museum, Hitsville U.S.A., by preserving the label's Detroit studio. She also served as president of the Motown Museum and has been called the \\"Mother of Motown\\". ==Biography== Esther Gordy Edwards was born to Berry Gordy, Sr. and Bertha Fuller Gordy in Washington County, Georgia. She was the couple's second oldest child and eldest daughter. When she was two years old, her parents moved to Detroit, Michigan. Edwards' younger siblings included sisters Anna, the late Loucye, and Gwen, as well as brothers Fuller, George, Berry and Robert, who was the youngest of the family. Edwards attended Detroit's prestigious Cass Technical High School. She later graduated from Howard University. Esther married Detroit politician George Edwards in 1951. From a previous relationship, she has a son by Robert Theron Bullock named Robert Berry Bullock, and through him has three granddaughters named Robin, Elesha and Gwen and grandson Alejandro Quinn a Major in the United States Marine Corps. ===Career=== Edwards founded the Gordy Printing Company with two of her brothers in the mid-1940s. With her husband, they created the Ber-Berry Co-Op, which was intended to provide loans to family members. Her younger brother Berry reportedly asked for an $800 loan to help start Motown Records in 1959. After Motown became established, Edwards took an active role in management and booking tours, including the legendary Motortown Revue in the early 1960s. While at Motown, Edwards took on a motherly role towards some of the label's younger acts. In the mid-1960s, she served as Motown's vice president and chief executive officer. She was succeeded in this role by Smokey Robinson in 1972. Edwards later served on the board for the Detroit Bank of Commonwealth and the Greater Detroit Chamber of Commerce. In 1985, Edwards became the director of the Motown Historical Museum (Hitsville U.S.A.) and has since been credited with carefully maintaining the original studios of Motown. Edwards is often described as \\"the pillar of Motown\\". ===Death=== Esther died surrounded by family and friends, following a long illness, at her Jefferson Towers home in Detroit on August 24, 2011. She was 91 years old. ==References== Category:1920 births Category:2011 deaths Category:Cass Technical High School alumni Category:People from Baldwin County, Georgia Category:People from Detroit Category:Culture of Detroit Category:Michigan Democrats Esther Gordy Edwards Category:Howard University alumni ","title":"Esther Gordy Edwards"},{"id":"20193303","text":"Angami may refer to * Angami Naga, one of the Naga peoples of northeastern India * Angami language ","title":"Angami"},{"id":"20193354","text":"is a former Japanese football player. ==Playing career== Tokushige was born in Satsumasendai on February 18, 1975.

Established in September 2006, it is run by United Learning, formerly known as United Church Schools Trust. It was officially opened by The Princess Royal on 19 March 2009. ==History== Paddington Academy opened in September 2006 as one of two new academies (along with Westminster Academy) established to replace North Westminster Community School. The initial plan was moving school to an older building located on North Wharf Road for its first term and then moving into a new building located on Maryland's Road. However, work on the new building was delayed multiple times, forcing the school to stay at North Wharf Road for a year before finally moving to the new and current site in 2007. ==AcademicsOfsted judgements=== In the Academy's first Ofsted report in 2007, it was described as \\"an academy that rightly judges that standards remain low and that achievement is inadequate.\\" The academy's second Ofsted report and first full inspection in 2009 showed that while there was an improvement in the grades of students, there was a lack of consistency within the subjects. However, overall the school was described as \\"[an] academy which provides a satisfactory quality of education.\\" In November 2011, the Academy was judged as Outstanding by Ofsted. ===GCSE results=== In 2007, GCSE results showed that only 25% of students managed to get 5 or more A*-C grades including English and Maths. The following year, that figure increased to 41%. Then in 2009, it fell to 34%. However, in 2010 the number of students achieving 5 or more A*-C GCSE grades including English and Maths jumped to 62% and in total, 94% of students managed to achieve 5 or more A*-C grades, up from 86% the year before. As of 2011, the results show that figure has managed to rise again to 68% with a total of 99% of students managing to achieve 5 or more A*-C GCSEs, a 5% increase from the prior year. In 2010, Paddington Academy became the second most improved academy in England, was ranked the 5th best school in the country and was ranked 2nd for the most student progress. As of 2011, it received the 3rd highest number of students receiving 5 or more A*-C GCSEs in Westminster and was ranked the 4th best school in England. In August 2018 at GCSE level 80% of students at the Academy gained at least a grade 4 in English and Maths. In addition, 60 of the grades gained by students were grade 9s, which is the highest attainable grade at GCSE and was achieved by only 3% of students nationally. At A Level, 32% of grades were awarded the highest marks of A* or A, 66% of A Level grades were awarded A*-B; 90% of grades were awarded A*-C and ten students gained at least 3+ A grades at A Level (7% of the cohort).

During his career, he became president of Showa University and also had his photography exhibited and published. ==Biography and medical career== Akira Toriyama was born on 20 June 1898 in Shinagawa-machi, Ebara-gun (now Shinagawa-ku), Tokyo.Unless otherwise noted, biographical information in this article is from Toriyama Akira shashinsh≈´ () / Photographs by Akira Toriyama (Tokyo: Mitsumura Printing, BeeBooks, 1997), a work edited by Toriyama's successors in ophthalmology at Showa University. He studied medicine at Tokyo Imperial University, graduating in 1926. His health was not good, and he is said to have been nudged toward ophthalmology by his own professor, who believed that the relatively stable working hours of an ophthalmologist would be better for Toriyama. In 1928, Toriyama became a professor of ophthalmology at Showa Medical School and he continued at the school as it became Showa Medical University and later Showa University, whose president he became in 1969. Toriyama also became chairman of the university's board of directors; he retired from both positions in 1988 but continued as an adviser. He died on 30 November 1994. Toriyama was awarded the Order of the Sacred Treasure, Second Class, in 1971, and Upper Fourth Rank (), in 1994.Source for both awards: Biographic Dictionary of Japanese Photography. ==Photography== In 1934, Toriyama realized that his work as an ophthalmologist gave him some spare time, and his uncle the amateur photographer Yasunari Toriyama introduced him to the Japan Photographic Society (JPS), where the skills of the younger man quickly developed. By 1937, his works were appearing in group shows in Paris, France, and Amsterdam, Netherlands, as well as Japan.Paris and Amsterdam: Certain photographs reproduced within Photographs by Akira Toriyama (1997) are identified on pp. 150-51 of that book as having been exhibited in \\"International [sic] d'Art Photographique Paris, 1937\\" and \\"Amsterdam International Focus Photo Salon, 1937\\". Toriyama's membership of JPS was central to his photography, and JPS retained (for example as the title of its magazine) Shinz≈ç Fukuhara's phrase from the 1920s, \\"Light with its harmony\\" (, Hikari to sono kaich≈ç).The description of JPS in the 1930s and Toriyama's photography is based on Ryuichi Kaneko, \\"Another View of 'Light with Its Harmony': Photographs by Akira Toriyama\\", in Photographs by Akira Toriyama, pp. 9-11. points out that the work of JPS changed with the times: from a start that rejected certain painterly influences on photography but that embraced the subject-matter and composition of traditional Japanese aesthetics, it moved to include the portrayal of urban scenes and fragments. Kaneko says that, influenced by Ros≈ç Fukuhara, Toriyama went further; for example, in his photography of plants \\"his emphasis on the sculptural qualities of leaves, stems, and branches is fresh even today\\"; further, that his style is similar to that of Sh≈çji Ueda, Akira Nomura, and other photographers of the generation who emerged in the late 1930s and are thought of as modernists rather than pictorialists. Kaneko concludes that \\"[Toriyama's] work clearly testifies to [his] Modernist will to live his own life, to express himself, to the full.\\" As his medical career progressed, Toriyama's photography continued but went largely unremarked. Following his death, Tomio Yoshikawa (, Yoshikawa Tomio) of Showa University visited his house and learned that he had left an enormous number of photographs. Yoshikawa soon had a collection of these published.Yoshinao Fukado, foreword to Photographs by Akira Toriyama. Fukado does not provide the title, and there is also no mention of this elsewhere in the book. (Fukado's wording may cover anything from a privately published booklet to an article in a university magazine.) Following this, Toriyama's family and ophthalmologists from Showa University discovered further large numbers of photographs and had selections of these published. First came Photographs by Akira Toriyama (1997), a lavish collection of well over a hundred monochrome photographs from the late thirties, reproduced in sepia. This was followed by A Visit to Showa (1999), a smaller collection of reproductions of colour slides thought to have been taken between 1962 and 1967. (\\"Showa\\" here refers to the Sh≈çwa period, which gave its name to the medical school where Toriyama worked.) ==Books== *Ky≈çmaku shikkan (, Scleral diseases). Nihon Ganka Zensho 18.

Berry Sr. (or Berry II) established a Booker T. Washington grocery store in Detroit, while Bertha co- founded the Friendship Mutual Life Insurance Company. Later, Berry Sr. mentored several recording acts for his son's Motown label. Bertha died in 1975. Berry II died in 1978. A tribute album, called Pops, We Love You!, and single, called \\"Pops, We Love You (A Tribute to Father)\\", were released later that year in his memory.Berry Gordy Sr. ‚Äì Find A GraveBertha Fuller Gordy ‚Äì Find A Grave ===Fuller Berry Gordy=== The eldest Gordy child, Fuller B. Gordy (September 9, 1918 ‚Äì November 9, 1991), born in Georgia, was an executive alongside his younger siblings in their brother Berry's Motown music company. Fuller was also a professional in bowling. His daughter Iris was married to singer Johnny Bristol.Fuller Gordy ‚Äì Find A Grave ===Esther Gordy Edwards=== The eldest Gordy daughter, Esther (April 25, 1920 ‚Äì August 24, 2011), born in Georgia, established herself early in business as a political campaigner for her husband, Detroit politician George Edwards. She was in charge of the family's savings fund which they called the \\"Ber-Berry\\" Co-op (a combination of the parents names \\"Bertha\\" and \\"Berry\\"). In 1959, her brother Berry wanted to borrow $1000 from the family savings fund to start a record company. Esther was skeptical, but ultimately Berry did get an $800 loan to start Tamla Records. Esther Gordy Edwards served as head of the art department and was the head of the artist management arm at Motown during the 1960s. Edwards also served as mentor, adviser, and vice president of Motown's main offices from 1961 until 1972, when Berry moved the entire operation to Los Angeles. In 1985, she founded the Motown Historical Museum at the site of the former Hitsville U.S.A. studios, where many of Motown's successful recording artists recorded. Esther died in 2011 at the age of 91.Esther Gordy Edwards ‚Äì Find A Grave ===Anna Gordy Gaye=== Though she is often remembered more for her volatile marriage to Motown legend Marvin Gaye, Anna Ruby Gordy (January 28, 1922 ‚Äì January 31, 2014), the third and last child born in Georgia prior to the family's move to Detroit, was one of Motown's earliest songwriters, penning several hits mainly for her first (and only) husband. Anna also co- founded a self-named music label (Anna Records) that would establish Motown's records nationally, such as Barrett Strong's \\"Money (That's What I Want)\\". In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Anna co-wrote The Originals' biggest hits, \\"Baby I'm For Real\\" and \\"The Bells\\", alongside Marvin. She also co-wrote \\"God Is Love\\" and \\"Flying High (In the Friendly Sky)\\" on Marvin's famed What's Going On album. Despite an acrimonious divorce in 1977, Gordy remained friends with Gaye until his 1984 death, after which Anna retreated into seclusion, only coming out briefly to celebrate Marvin's music career by attending ceremonies, including Marvin's 1987 induction to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. Anna died in 2014 at the age of 92. ===Loucye Gordy Wakefield=== Another astute businesswoman, Loucye (1924 ‚Äì July 24, 1965) was named head of Jobete Music, Motown's main publishing division created by Berry. Loucye headed the division until her sudden death from brain cancer in 1965. Her youngest brother Robert succeeded her as the publishing company's head. At the time of her death on July 24, 1965, she went by the name Loucye S. Gordy Wakefield.Loucye Gordy Wakefield ‚Äì Find A Grave ===George Gordy=== George Weldon Gordy Sr. (January 7, 1926 ‚Äì July 27, 2011) started several short businesses before joining his brother's Motown label in 1960, where he was a co-writer of several songs released by Motown artists. By his wife Rosemary (who died in 1980), he had six sons and two daughters. He died in his sleep at the age of 85.George Gordy ‚Äì Find A Grave ===Gwen Gordy Fuqua=== Another important member of Motown's growing success was Gwendolyn Gordy (November 26, 1927 ‚Äì November 8, 1999). Gwen partnered with her brother Berry and then- boyfriend Billy Davis to co-pen several hits for Jackie Wilson in the mid-1950s. In 1959, Gwen, Billy and sister Anna formed Anna Records in Detroit. Anna would be the site where the hit song, \\"Money (That's What I Want)\\", then a regional single for Berry's Tamla Records, would get its first national distribution. Two years later, Anna Records was absorbed by Motown. In 1961, Gwen married The Moonglows' Harvey Fuqua and the two presided over the labels Harvey Records and Tri-Phi Records; the latter label represented acts such as The Spinners. By 1964, Gwen joined Motown's staff songwriting team, later writing \\"Distant Lover\\" for her brother-in-law, Marvin Gaye, and discovering the disco group High Inergy in 1976. Gwen died of cancer in 1999 at the age of 72.Gwendolyn Gordy Fuqua ‚Äì Find A Grave ===Berry Gordy=== A former boxer and jazz record store owner, Berry Gordy, Jr. (born November 28, 1929) first got involved with producing and writing R&B; songs in 1955. Amongst Gordy's earliest songwriting successes were songs he penned as one- third of the songwriting team behind Jackie Wilson's first legion of solo hits, including \\"Reet Petite\\", \\"To Be Loved\\" and \\"Lonely Teardrops\\". By 1959, Gordy, fed up with not being paid royalties for his work with Wilson and other acts, decided to form a record label. He convinced his sister Esther to lend him $800 from the tuition fund his father had established for him and formed Tamla Records in January of that year. The label didn't become national until later that year after the success of Barrett Strong's \\"Money (That's What I Want)\\", and the label changed its name to Motown Records in December. Its first national release was The Miracles' \\"Way Over There\\". After 1964, Motown became one of the most successful recording labels in the business and \\"The Motown Sound\\", partially cultivated by Gordy, began to dominate popular music and pop culture. Gordy soon developed Motown Industries in 1968, which developed television specials and variety shows. By 1973, Motown had produced more than 100 top ten and number-one singles on various Billboard charts and had become the most successful black business company ever. By founding Motown Records, Gordy became the first African-American owner of a major recording label. He retired from being president of Motown Records in 1973 and from Motown Industries in 1988; he sold Motown's interest for $61 million to MCA Records and Boston Ventures. Gordy retained Motown's music publishing division, including Jobete Music Co., and Motown's film and television production company, Gordy was inducted to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame for his musical achievements the same year he sold Motown. In September 2019, at the age of 89, Gordy announced his retirement during the Motown 60th anniversary program in Detroit. ===Robert Gordy=== Robert Louis Gordy (born July 15, 1931) is best known for playing a cameo in the Diana Ross-starring vehicle Lady Sings the Blues, playing a drug dealer named \\"Hawk\\". Also an early songwriter of several songs for the Motown label, Gordy recorded a 1958 novelty hit, titled \\"Everyone Was There\\", under the stage name Bob Kayli. He replaced Loucye Gordy as head of Jobete Music Publishing in 1965 after Loucye's death. Gordy is the father of Robert Louis Gordy Jr. ==Music groups formed consisting of family membersApollo=== A quintet formed by Kerry Gordy and his friends. Also in this group was Kerry's half-brother Cliff Liles, a son by Raynoma Mayberry Liles and Charles Liles. ===LMFAO=== A duo consisting of Skyler Austen (\\"Sky Blu\\") Gordy (born August 23, 1986), grandson of Berry Gordy Jr. and Thelma Coleman through their son Berry Gordy IV and his wife Valerie Robeson, and Stefan Kendal (\\"Redfoo\\") Gordy (born September 3, 1975), son of Berry Gordy Jr. and Nancy Leiviska. ==Other family membersIris Gordy=== Iris Gordy (born 1943) served as a vice president at Motown, where she helped launch the careers of DeBarge, Teena Marie, and Rick James.

Later, he worked as a staff writer and producer at Motown under his given name, Kerry Ashby. He continues to work as an entertainment industry executive today. ===Rockwell=== Kennedy William Gordy, known by the stage name Rockwell, is the son of Berry Gordy Jr. and former girlfriend Margaret Norton, Kennedy William Gordy changed his name to Rockwell in 1983 to become a rock star. The singer, who earned his deal with Motown without his father's knowledge, recorded his biggest hit, 1984's \\"Somebody's Watching Me\\", which included background vocals by Michael Jackson. The song rose to number-two on the Billboard Hot 100. Rockwell turned out to be a one-hit wonder and after two more albums, he retired from music in the late 1980s. ===Rhonda Ross Kendrick=== Rhonda Ross Kendrick is the daughter of Berry Gordy Jr. and Diana Ross, Rhonda garnered fame as an actress, first in the daytime soap Another World for which she was nominated for a Daytime Emmy and later in films like The Temptations, where she played Temptations original member Paul Williams' wife.

In 1937 he entered residence at Trinity College (University of Melbourne), where he played cricket and football, graduating in 1938 with a Bachelor of Arts (honours).Fleur de Lys Nov. 1937, pp. 12, 15, 19. Bunting was one of four graduates accepted into the Commonwealth Public Service in 1940, accepting a posting in Canberra within the Department of Trade and Customs and later, the Department of Post-war Reconstruction. After a short posting overseas, Bunting became a member of the Sydney-based Inter-Departmental Dollar Committee, which dealt with the allocation of dollars for imports. In 1950 he was appointed to the Prime Minister's Department as an assistant secretary and later returned to London as Official Secretary at Australia House. Back in Canberra, Bunting was appointed deputy secretary in the Prime Minister's Department and appointed as Secretary to that department in 1959, a position he continued to hold until 1968, and served successive prime ministers Sir Robert Menzies, Harold Holt, and John McEwen. Within days of John Gorton becoming Prime Minister, Bunting was sidelined as Secretary to the newly formed Department of the Cabinet Office and was replaced by Lenox Hewitt as Secretary to the Prime Minister's Department. On taking office as Prime Minister in 1971, William McMahon reversed Gorton's changes and restored Bunting to the pre-eminent position as Secretary to the newly formed Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. Hewitt accepted appointment to the lesser role of Secretary to the Department of the Vice-President of the Executive Council. Bunting provided advice to incoming Prime Minister Gough Whitlam on the transition to government; with Whitlam later opining of Bunting: > (His) loyalty, integrity, diligence and dedication have made him a leader > and example among all public servants. Bunting was appointed to serve as High Commissioner in London, with effect from 1 February 1975. Suffering a heart attack whilst in Dundee in February 1976, Bunting returned to Australia in 1977, unable to complete his full term as High Commissioner. Upon his return to Australia, Bunting was appointed as a consultant to the Office of National Assessments. A close confidant of Robert Menzies during and after his Prime Ministerial career, in 1978 Bunting was appointed as the inaugural National Coordinator of the Sir Robert Menzies Memorial Foundation. In 1988, Bunting authored a biography of Robert Menzies, entitled R. G. Menzies: a portrait. Bunting died in Sydney on 2 May 1995, aged 77, survived by Lady Bunting and their three sons. ==Honours== In 1953 Bunting was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire; and upgraded to a Commander of the Order in 1961. Knighted as a Knight Bachelor in 1964; and appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1977. In 1982 Bunting was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia in recognition for public and community service. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Category:1918 births Category:1995 deaths Category:People educated at Trinity Grammar School, Kew Category:People educated at Trinity College (University of Melbourne) Category:Australian Knights Bachelor Category:Australian Knights Commander of the Order of the British Empire Category:Companions of the Order of Australia Category:Secretaries of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet Category:Secretaries of the Australian Government Education Department Category:High Commissioners of Australia to the United Kingdom Category:Permanent Representatives of Australia to the International Maritime Organization Category:20th-century Australian public servants ","title":"John Bunting (public servant)"},{"id":"20193667","text":"East Ramapo Central School District is a school district in Ramapo, New York, United States. It is headquartered in the Senator Eugene Levy Dr. Jack R. Anderson Education Center.\\"SENTER.jpg .\\" East Ramapo Central School District. Retrieved on April 7, 2011. The school district serves areas of eastern Town of Ramapo, and portions of the towns of Clarkstown and Haverstraw, including: Chestnut Ridge, Kaser, New Hempstead, New Square, Spring Valley which spans Ramapo and Clarkstown, and portions of Airmont, and Wesley Hills. The district also serves the hamlets of Hillcrest and Monsey and much of the hamlets of Nanuet, New City, and Viola. It also serves portions of the Village of Pomona which straddles the borders of Town of Ramapo and Town of Haverstraw. The district lies just to the east and borders the Suffern Central School District (formerly Ramapo Central), which serves much of the western portion of the Town of Ramapo, including Suffern, Sloatsburg, Hillburn, Montebello, and much of Airmont, excluding the extreme eastern portion of the village. ==History20th century=== On March 4, 1952, seven school districts merged to form Ramapo Central School District No.2, due to centralization. On August 22, 1973, this district was renamed the East Ramapo Central School District. The school district has seen major demographic changes since the late 1990s. In 1997, of the 18,000 children transported by the district, 10,500 were students of yeshiva private schools. Joseph Berger of The New York Times said in an article written during that year that this involved \\"a proportion of public school money to bus private school students that few American towns can match.\\"Berger, Joseph. \\"Growing Pains for a Rural Hasidic Enclave.\\" The New York Times. January 13, 1997. During that year 9,500 of the children within the district were private school students from the Village of New Square, Village of Kaser, and the community of Monsey. A 1997 The New York Times article stated that some East Ramapo school district parents said that the high proportion of private school parents to public school parents could threaten the district. Harvey Katz, an Orthodox Jew who served as a school board member, said that \\"Just because my children are not in the public schools doesn't mean I don't care about all the children. Children are our future, wherever they may be.\\" The district was one of five districts in New York State where more students were enrolled in private school than in public school due to religious reasons.Weinstock, Cheryl Platzman. \\"Easy City Access In a Ramapos Setting.\\" The New York Times. March 2, 1997. 2. ===21st century=== According to reporting by radio show This American Life, which ran an episode in 2014 called \\"A Not-So-Simple Majority\\", the Orthodox Jewish population and the remainder of the District had lived under a system of d√©tente, where private Jewish schools, or yeshivas, of the Orthodox would not receive additional scrutiny in meeting state standards, if the Orthodox population would refrain from voting in school district elections. The Orthodox population broke the d√©tente over special education needs, upset that special education children would not receive public funding at the private schools. In 2005 the Orthodox Jewish population of the district gained majority control of the school board. This new board began reducing the budget and lowering taxes. The communities using the public schools have opposed these actions.Wallace-Wells, Benjamin. \\"Them and Them.\\" New York magazine. April 21, 2013. p. 1-2.

August 31, 2007. By 2010, due to lowered taxes and reduced budgets, the district's finances had decreased and services were reduced at the schools, forcing students to take five- and six-year graduation plans instead of four-year plans.Wallace-Wells, Benjamin. \\"Them and Them.\\" New York magazine.

July 29, 2010. The Journal News In an official response to an investigation of the sale, New York State Education Commissioner David Steiner stated the East Ramapo board ‚Äúabused its discretion by hastily approving the sale.‚Äù The 12 acre campus, assessed at $10.2 million (market value) by the Assessor‚Äôs Office of Clarkstown was given only a $3.2 million appraisal by the school board's own attorney, Albert D‚ÄôAgostino. On June 8, 2011 the commissioner of the NY State Education Department halted the sale of the building stating the board failed its fiduciary responsibility to the district when it approved the $3.2 million deal. The sale eventually went through for $4.9 million.https://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/534/a-not-so- simple-majority In July, the new state Education Commissioner John King put a hold on the district's sale of Colton Elementary to Congregation Bais Malka/Hebrew Academy for Special Children with similar questions over the appraisal and bidding process as dogged the blocked sale of the Hillcrest school. On August 31, 2011, New York State Office of the Comptroller released an audit of the Board, for the period July 1, 2008 to April 13, 2010.Report accessed online, available as a downloadable *pdf. The report criticizes the district for a number of serious lapses including failing to put $2.4 million in professional services contracts out to bid, allowing three senior school board members to receive health care through the school district's insurance pool after they failed to make $15,672 in payments, and failing to maintain proper inventory controls over $2.4 million in textbooks purchased for students not attending public schools, as required under state law. Most unsettling, the audit found that District officials inaccurately projected a June 30, 2010 fund balance of $13 million when preparing District's 2010-11 austerity budget that was presented to the electorate and on which cutbacks and layoffs were based. In fact, the District's audited financial statement showed a June 30, 2010, fund balance of $17,793,047, substantially higher than public estimates. The report states: \\"The board, along with district officials, failed to fulfill its stewardship, oversight and leadership responsibilities when it failed to establish a proper control environment, implement its own adopted policy and establish policies and procedures required by sound business practices.\\" The report concludes. \\"The deficiencies exposed district funds and assets to abuse, waste and/or loss.\\" The local paper headline was \\"East Ramapo bungled millions,\\" and in a scathing editorial, the paper called for a thorough investigation of the board.Audit- East-Ramapo-bungled-millions The Journal News [of the LOwer HUDson].

It was subsequently reaired in June 2017. In November 2014 a state-appointed monitor charged with investigating the district delivered a sharply critical assessment. The monitor, Hank Greenberg, said the board showed favoritism to Jewish students who attend private Orthodox schools in the district, and cut services to the 9,000 district students, mostly black and Hispanic, who attend the district's public schools. Greenberg accused the board of fiscal mismanagement and a lack of transparency in its dealings. In violation of state laws, it held most of its meetings behind closed doors, only let residents speak at the end of meetings, typically late at night, and inappropriately called critics anti- Semites. Greenberg recommended that the state provide resources that would be delivered more fairly, but stopped short of calling for a state take-over of the district. On June 11, 2015, New York state Assembly members passed a bill that would create a state monitor to oversee the school district. By 2016, the state legislature and the school board were negotiating a budget compromise, but conflicts continued into 2017. In November 2017, a lawsuit was filed against the district in US District Court by parents of public school students, district residents, and the local chapter of the NAACP. The plaintiffs charged that by using at-large voting, it is impossible for minority candidates to win competitive elections in the district. The district president stated the district did not set the election rules and that the lawsuit would cost the district money. U.S. District Court Judge Cathy Seibel denied the districts motion to dismiss the case in April 2018. ==Demographics== As of 2014 over 75% of the students are on free lunch or reduced lunch programs. Students from immigrant families make up much of the student body; many originated from the Caribbean and Latin America. Benjamin Wallace-Wells of New York wrote that \\"There are now only a handful of white students\\" attending district schools.

Grabowsky and Doris Ruth Moreno. From 1966 to 1995, he resided with his family in Southern California, primarily in Anaheim but also for shorter periods in surrounding towns such as Garden Grove. He attended Thomas Alva Edison Elementary School in Anaheim, and later Dr. Jonas E. Salk Elementary School. He wrote creative writing while at school, contributing to periodicals such as Jack N' Jill Magazine, and also, as a result of his strict conservative Christian Pentecostal upbringing, became involved with evangelism, related contemporary Christian music, and songwriting. By the age of 18, he was preaching, singing, and playing piano to congregations of over 1,000 people. In 1993, Grabowsky's parents moved with their autistic daughter Carol Jean to Sacramento, California. In June 1995, Carol went missing from her adult education services school, and her body was found by in a drainage ditch near Discovery Park, Sacramento, in October 1995. The case remains as an unsolved closed case. ==Writing career== After working as an extra in Hollywood for such films as Masters of the Universe and Night of the Creeps,, and pursuing a modelling career, Grabowsky became the acting coach to Walter Koenig, who introduced Nicholas to a New York publisher of mass market paperback novels. His first novel, Pray Serpent's Prey, a Christian allegory of vampires invading a small Montana town which Grabowsky began writing in high school, was accepted and published by Critic's Choice Paperbacks/Lorevan Publishing under the pseudonym Nicholas Randers. Grabowsky published subsequent works under the Randers name including The Rag Man' and Tale of the Makeshift Faire before 1990, and romance novels and self-help books under the name Marsena Shane including Sweet Dreams Lady Moon, The Easy Way to Great Legs, Your Heart Belongs to You and June Park up until 1991, when he left his pseudonyms.

It was released in Europe with the title Snowboard Challenge. ==Gameplay== There are three mountains that the player must overcome in order to complete the game. As the player descends the mountain, the terrain becomes more and more difficult to navigate. There are three degrees of difficulty on each of the mountains. The first is novice (marked by a circle), the second is intermediate (marked by a square), and the third is expert (marked by a diamond). The player starts out with four lives. There are five different events and a total of 18 levels of play. In order to progress to the next event, the player must first successfully complete the event before it. If the player falls or runs out of time a life is taken away. After completing a trail, the player is rewarded with a bonus life. If the player is able to complete all of the trails and events, they will have completed the game. ===Scoring Points=== There are several ways in which the player is able to score points in the game. Some of the ways are: * Avoiding objects, such as trees and flags, by sliding up or down on the screen * Performing tricks * Jumping off of ramps and other elevated terrain The player performs tricks by jumping and then pressing in any direction on the directional pad. ===The Events=== # downhill: In this event the player must avoid hitting objects and falling. It is a timed run, so if the player takes too long, they will be sent back up to the top of the slope. The same goes for falling and colliding into objects. # Slalom: The goal of this event is to pass through the flags placed along the slope. If the player fails to get between the pairs of flags they will return to the top of the mountain. # Half-pipe: This event is all about points. The player must gain up speed and perform tricks at the peak of either side of the half-pipe. # Moguls: In order to pass this event the player must perform tricks to jump over the moguls (bumps in the snow). # Backwoods: The last event is mostly a combination of speed, tricks, and survival. It tests everything the player has learned throughout the game. This event is very difficult. ==References External links == *‚ÄúHasbro Game and Toy Instructions‚Äù _Hasbro._ 2008\\\\.

Subtypes of DBEs are: * design-basis criticality: \\"A criticality accident that is the most severe design basis accident of that type applicable to the area under consideration.\\" * design-basis earthquake (DBE): \\"That earthquake for which the safety systems are designed to remain functional both during and after the event, thus assuring the ability to shut down and maintain a safe configuration.\\" * design-basis explosion: \\"An explosion that is the most severe design basis accident of that type applicable to the area under consideration.\\" * design-basis fire: \\"A fire that is the most severe design basis accident of this type.

However, some have claimed that the design basis for tsunami events at Fukushima was incorrect.http://carnegieendowment.org/files/fukushima.pdf Accidents caused by poor design, failure to follow listed safety procedures, or other forms of human error are not considered to be beyond design basis accidents. The terminology can be unclear, however, because a poorly handled design basis accident can result in conditions beyond what was considered likely, causing a beyond design basis accident. For this reason, some industry experts have criticized the use of design basis terminology. The Three Mile Island accident and the Chernobyl disaster are examples of design basis accidents becoming non design basis accidents largely due to failures to follow the written operating procedures. ==Beyond-design-basis events== Beyond-design-basis events can reduce or eliminate the margin of safety of the structures, systems and components, possibly resulting in a catastrophic failure.

Todreas, Nuclear Systems:Elements of Thermal Design, Volume 2, CRC Press 1992, ; page 347 The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster was caused by a \\"beyond-design- basis event,\\" the tsunami and associated earthquakes were more powerful than the plant was designed to accommodate. The plant withstood the earthquake but the tsunami overflowed the seawall.

The executions of auxiliary movements are also not decisive for a term-classification. These auxiliary movements can also base on pneumatic and hydraulic principles. In comparison to hydraulic press machines the maximum compaction forces of mechanical powder presses are limited and are placed in the range >/= 5000 kN. For the requirements of wet- and dry pressing techniques in the field of Technical Ceramics cams-, eccentric-, knuckle joint- as well as round table presses have proved and tested, whereas cam-presses especially used for wet-press-techniques of pourable materials. The range of compaction force of mechanical presses for products of the Technical Ceramics is < 2500 kN, what is caused from the less density of the ceramic materials. Normally the upper punch-, lower punch- and die systems of mechanical presses don‚Äôt work on base of multi-subdivided punches. ==Application-Advantages in the field of Technical Ceramics== Adaptable cam-executions, which can be made suitable individually to the concerned products, will meet especially the requirements of wet-press- technique of pourable compounds, while applications of eccentric-, knuckle- joint and round table presses are particularly related on the dry-press- technique of compounds with gliding characteristics. The sinusoidal movement of eccentric presses offers advantages especially for bigger strokes < 100 strokes per minute and the distorted sinusoidal movement of the knuckle joint is especially used for products, which need a longer time for deairing in the phase of compaction and a longer time for decompression after the bottom dead centre. For this kind of compaction technology the strokes are limited < 35 strokes per minute, but in contrast to that the compaction speed of round table presses for small and simple shaped products are especially high and quantities < 30,000 pcs per minute can be realized. ==Context between ceramic compaction technology and design principles of the mechanical presses== The unit of product‚Äìtechnology‚Äìpress machine / tooling is characterizing the context between the ceramic compaction technology and the design principles of the mechanical presses. Distinctions of the die- withdrawal- and the ejection technology of the uniaxial dry- and wet-press- technique in the technical ceramics influence the approachable quality of the compactions in depending of the geometric shape of the products and in depending of the selected type of press. Because the achievement of a speed-proportional compaction relation with pure mechanical presses is very difficult to realize and high mechanical investments are necessary, more and more combined mechanic-hydraulic function principles on base of subdivided punches will win a higher signification, because the requirements of the high-accuracy-pressing can be met better. The design principles of particularly mechanical powder presses, explained in a dissertation of Dr.B.Froherz offer some base confrontation of advantages and disadvantages related to technology and presses especially for tool designers. ==See also== * Eccentric (mechanism) * Cold compaction * Ceramic engineering * Powder metallurgy Category:Ceramic engineering ","title":"Mechanical powder press"},{"id":"20193768","text":"Babylon is the second album by New Orleans R&B; artist Dr. John.

It played an important part in the early history of the genre, contributing to its popularization all around Cuba. In 1927, the band incorporated a cornet player becoming the Septeto Habanero. Although most original members left in the 1930s, the band has continued to perform and record with different line- ups. Their last album was released in 2010 for their 90th anniversary. ==HistoryOrigins=== In 1916, tres player and director Ricardo Mart√≠nez from Santiago de Cuba founded the Cuarteto Oriental together with Guillermo Castillo (botija), Gerardo Mart√≠nez (lead vocals and claves) and Felipe Neri Cabrera (maracas). In 1917, they left Oriente to record four tracks for Columbia Records in Havana. The songs are listed in a Columbia catalog for 1921, but are probably lost. However, the same group expanded to a sextet in 1918, with Castillo now on guitar, Antonio Bacallao on botija and √ìscar Sotolongo on bongos. They renamed themselves Sexteto T√≠pico Oriental. Meanwhile, members of the Victor record label decided to make son recordings at the Hotel Inglaterra in Havana, hiring musician Carlos God√≠nez to organize a band.D√≠az Ayala, Crist√≥bal 1994. \\"El son\\" in Cuba canta y baila: discograf√≠a de la m√∫sica cubana 1898‚Äì1925. San Juan, Puerto Rico: Fundaci√≥n Musicalia. p. 317 et seq. Only two of the six recordings they made (\\"Mujer bandolera\\" and \\"Rosa, qu√© linda eres\\") have been issued on CD. Credited to Sexteto Habanero God√≠nez, these are the oldest known recordings in the sexteto format.Blanco, Jes√∫s 1992. 80 a√±os del son y soneros en el Caribe. Caracas, Venezuela: Tropykos. p. 14 et seq. According to D√≠az Ayala, the band in these recordings featured Carlos God√≠nez (tres and director), Mar√≠a Teresa Vera (lead vocals and claves), Manuel Corona (guitar and second vocals), \\"Sinsonte\\" (third vocals and maracas), Alfredo Bolo√±a (bongos) and a sixth musician, possibly Rafael Zequeira. In 1919, the discrepancies within the Sexteto T√≠pico Oriental led to the departure of Ricardo Mart√≠nez, who was then replaced by God√≠nez. In 1920, the band renamed itself Sexteto Habanero.Giro, Radam√©s 2007. Diccionario enciclop√©dico de la m√∫sica en Cuba. La Habana. vol 2, p. 230. Thus, the founding members of the Sexteto Habanero were Guillermo Castillo (guitar and director), Carlos God√≠nez (tres), Gerardo Mart√≠nez (lead vocals and claves), Antonio Bacallao (botija), √ìscar Sotolongo (square bong√≥) and Felipe Neri Cabrera (maracas). The instrumental set-up is interesting, because they use some of the original instruments of the son, including the botijaOrovio, Helio (1981). Diccionario de la m√∫sica cubana.

From left to right: Agust√≠n Guti√©rrez, Abelardo Barroso, Felipe Neri Cabrera, Gerardo Mart√≠nez, Guillermo Castillo, Carlos God√≠nez. The bongosero's tuning lamp is circled. The main set of recordings by the Sexteto Habanero were made between 1925 and 1931. The line-up in these recordings was modernized with respect to the original sextet, as the group appreciated that the double bass was a musically more suitable instrument than the botijuela, which was abandoned by them and most other son groups. By 1925 the band's line-up featured Gerardo Mart√≠nez as the new leader, also singing and playing double bass; Guillermo Castillo on guitar and vocals; Felipe Neri Cabrera on maracas and vocals; and two new members: Agust√≠n Guti√©rrez on bong√≥ (replaced Sotolongo in 1923 and left in 1928), and Abelardo Barroso as lead vocalist and maraquero, both of whom would also play with the Habanero's rival band, Septeto Nacional. Rafael Hern√°ndez \\"El Picher\\" often replaced Barroso on lead vocals and maracas, while Jos√© Manuel Carriera Incharte \\"El Chino\\" (bongosero in the Nacional) possibly played instead of Agust√≠n Guti√©rrez in some sessions. The group's recordings in the 1925 to 1931 era were made in New York City and originally released as 78 rpm singles, now available on LP and CD. The music is of high quality, considering the technical limitations of the time. The group won first prize in the Concurso de Sones in 1925 and 1926.Santos, John (1990).

On March 21, 1927, Enrique Hern√°ndez joined the Habanero on cornet, turning the sexteto into a septeto. Hern√°ndez was replaced by trumpeter F√©lix Chappott√≠n in February 1928. Chappott√≠n would remain with the band until 1930, when he was replaced by Jos√© Interi√°n.

This footage, which features √ìscar Sotolongo's son, Andr√©s Sotolongo, on bongos, ranks among the earliest pieces of film documenting son cubano. ===Septeto Habanero and Conjunto T√≠pico Habanero=== Although de facto a septet since 1927, the band didn't release music as the Septeto Habanero until 1945. Due to the advent of conjuntos and big bands, the band remained largely inactive between 1931 and 1945, making recordings only in a session on September 17, 1940. In the early 1930s the band experienced important line-up changes, with Guillermo Castillo and Carlos God√≠nez leaving in 1934. The following year, director Gerardo Mart√≠nez left the band to form a new group, Conjunto T√≠pico Habanero. Throughout the 1940s, the Conjunto T√≠pico Habanero would remain linked to the Septeto Habanero, as Mart√≠nez made recordings with the Septeto in the mid 1940s (there were sessions in 1945, 1946 and 1948). After the death of Mart√≠nez in 1958, the Septeto Habanero incorporated a tumbadora, g√ºiro and another trumpet under the direction of Manolo Fur√© (in the band since 1952), changing its name to Conjunto T√≠pico Habanero. ===Re-formation=== In 1983, the Conjunto T√≠pico Habanero reverted its name definitively to Septeto Habanero, still with Manolo Fur√© as lead singer and claves player. In 1995, the band recorded an album for its 75th anniversary entitled 75 A√±os despu√©s. The band was actually as octet (and remains so), featuring Manolo Fur√© (lead vocals, claves), Germ√°n Pedro Ib√°√±ez (guitar), Jos√© Antonio P√©rez (vocals and maracas), Digno Marcelino P√©rez (vocals and g√ºiro), Felipe Ferrer (tres), B√°rbaro Teuntor Garc√≠a (trumpet), Faustino S√°nchez Illa (electric bass) and Ricardo Ferro Vicente (bongos). After the death of Fur√©, guitarist and singer Germ√°n Pedro \\"Pedrito\\" Ib√°√±ez, who joined the band in 1962, became the director until his death in 2007. In November 1997, the band recorded Orgullo de los soneros, an album released by Lusafrica in 1998. The line-up in these recordings featured Germ√°n Pedro Ib√°√±ez (guitar and director), Jos√© Antonio P√©rez (vocals and claves), Emilio Moret (vocals and g√ºiro), Digno Marcelino P√©rez (vocals and maracas), Felipe Ferrer (tres), Servando Arango (trumpet), Faustino S√°nchez Illa (double bass) and Ricardo Ferro Vincente (bongos).Rosenberg, Dan (1998). Orgullo de los soneros liner notes. Paris, France: Lusafrica. Their second album on Lusafrica, Celebrando sus 80 a√±os, was released in March 2000 for the band's 80th anniversary with the same line- up. In 2010, their 90th anniversary album 90 a√±os: Orgullo de los soneros was nominated for the Latin Grammy Award for Best Traditional Tropical Album. The album was recorded between February and March 2009 with the following line-up: Felipe Ferrer (tres and director), Juan A. J√∫stiz (vocals and g√ºiro), Jos√© Antonio P√©rez (vocals), Emilio Moret (vocals and maracas), Ernesto Laza (bong√≥ and bell), Ibrahim Aties (baby bass), Digno Marcelino P√©rez (vocals and claves), Gilberto Azcuy (trumpet) and Jaime Graci√°n (manager).90 a√±os: Orgullo de los soneros liner notes.

The mansion was built in 1806 and belonged to different owners. The most significant of them was the Governor of Taganrog Pyotr Papkov. Emperor Alexander I of Russia stayed there twice ‚Äì in 1818 and 1825. After his death the building was bought by his widow empress consort Elizabeth Alexeievna (Louise of Baden) and the first memorial museum in Russia dedicated to the Emperor was established there. Among the visitors to the palace of Alexander I were the Russian emperors Alexander II of Russia and Alexander III, poets Alexander Pushkin and Vasily Zhukovsky, artist Ivan Aivazovsky, People‚Äôs commissar of enlightenment Anatoly Lunacharsky, and many others. For 12 years beginning in 1864 an amateur choir conducted by Pavel Chekhov (Anton Chekhov's father) sang in the Church of Exaltation of the Cross, which was established within the mansion to honor the emperor. At the end of 1860s ‚Äì beginning of 1870s Alexander, Nicolas and Anton Chekhov sang there in choral parts of descant and alto. In 1928 the memorial museum was closed and some of the exhibits were moved into the Alferaki Palace.

The first Frog title in English was published in 1989, entitled Frog In Love, translated by Klaus Flugge for Andersen Press. Frog books have been translated into more than 50 languages. So far eight titles have been translated from Dutch to English. In the Netherlands Frog is known as Kikker and he has become a well-known and loved book character. Together with his friends Pig, Duck and Hare, Frog lives in an anthropomorphic animal world. He observes daily events from a childlike perspective, offering children insight into social interactions. In Frog's world, there is no status. All the animals are the same size, which gives them absolute equality . Every animal has its own personality and skills. Frog and his friends enjoy life and deal with real life issues, such as fear, love, sadness, and loss, making these difficult subjects and emotions more understandable for children. At the end of each book, there's always a positive solution for the dilemma's the animals face. In Britain Frog Is A Hero was included in the National Curriculum. Velthuijs received the prestigious Hans Christian Andersen Medal in 2004 for the illustrations of his own Frog books. When Max Velthuijs died in January 2005, Carmen Diana Dearden said: ‚Äòlike in Frog and the Birdsong, ‚Äúall his life he sang beautifully for us,‚Äù and he will always sing his lovely songs through his books.‚Äô Frog page at Andersen Press ==References== Category:Series of children's books Category:Dutch children's literature Category:Dutch picture books ","title":"Frog (picture books)"},{"id":"20193855","text":"Lambda Literary Awards (also known as the \\"Lammys\\") are awarded yearly by the United States-based Lambda Literary Foundation to published works that celebrate or explore LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) themes. To qualify, a book must have been published in the United States in the year current to the official year of the award; the presentation ceremony is held a year later. The Lambda Literary Foundation states that its mission is \\"to celebrate LGBT literature and provide resources for writers, readers, booksellers, publishers, and librarians - the whole literary community.\\" Since their inception in 1989, awards have been given in various categories in fiction and non-fiction. The category for speculative fiction works has changed several times; from science fiction and mystery, to science fiction and fantasy, and finally to LGBT Sci-Fi, fantasy and horror. This category is open to submissions in the form of novels, novellas, short stories, collections and anthologies. Initially, the genre categories were also split into gay men's and lesbian categories but were merged in 1993. This article lists all the award nominees and winners for all the variously titled science fiction categories. Multi-time winners of the award include Nicola Griffith (four wins), Melissa Scott (four wins), Jim Grimsley (two wins), and Stephen Pagel (two wins). Samuel R. Delany has also won the lifetime achievement award twice. Nicola Griffith holds the record for most nominations, and Perry Brass has the most nominations without winning, having been a losing finalist four times. ==Winners and nominees== The Lambda Literary Award Medal Design 2008 In the following table, the years correspond to the year of the book's release; the ceremonies are always held the following year.

It was situated on the Barnsley Coal Railway between Staincross and Mapplewell and Ryhill. The first section of the line to open was that from Stairfoot to Applehaigh (just north of Notton and Royston station) in 1870 so that Rosa Colliery could be served. The station opened, along with two others on the line, on 1 September 1882, and was closed to passengers by the LNER on 22 September 1930. It had flanking platforms and simple buildings to house all the facilities constructed in wood. == References == * Dow, George. \\"Great Central\\" Vol 2. (Dominion of Watkin)(1962), Loco.

NATO and also the Italian, German and British governments saw violence in the form of \\"communist fighting organizations\\" as a serious threat. ==Support for terrorist organizations== According to Soviet defector Grigori Besedovsky, the NKVD was directly coordinating a number of bombings in Poland as early as in the 1920s. The largest bombing, against Warsaw Citadel on 13 October 1923, destroyed a large military ammunition storage facility, killing 28 and wounding 89 Polish soldiers. Another bombing on 23 May 1923 at Warsaw University killed a number of people, including professor Roman Orzƒôcki. Further bombings happened in Czƒôstochowa, Krak√≥w and Bia≈Çystok. Soviet secret services have been described by GRU defectors Viktor Suvorov and Stanislav Lunev as \\"the primary instructors of terrorists worldwide.\\"Stanislav Lunev. Through the Eyes of the Enemy: The Autobiography of Stanislav Lunev, Regnery Publishing, Inc., 1998. .Viktor Suvorov Inside Soviet Military Intelligence , 1984, .Viktor Suvorov Spetsnaz , 1987, Hamish Hamilton Ltd, . The terrorism was seen by Soviet leadership as the only way to reduce the imbalance between USSR military and economical power against the Western world. According to Ion Mihai Pacepa, KGB General Aleksandr Sakharovsky once said: \\"In today‚Äôs world, when nuclear arms have made military force obsolete, terrorism should become our main weapon.\\"Russian Footprints - by Ion Mihai Pacepa, National Review Online, August 24, 2006 He also claimed that \\"airplane hijacking is my own invention\\" and that in 1969 alone, 82 planes were hijacked worldwide by the KGB-financed PLO. After defeat of Soviet-controlled Arab states in the 1967 Six-Day war, Soviet Union started a widespread undercover campaign against Israel, involving propaganda as well as direct military support (funding, arms, training) to terrorist groups declaring Israel as their enemy. Additionally, the USSR took the decision to increase anti-Israeli sentiment by disseminating anti-Zionist propaganda and even referencing previous anti- Semitic tropes from Western culture, such as the Jewish-Freemason conspiracy theories. The overall goal of the campaign was to spread the idea that the state of Israel was an oppressive, imperialist state which was built on unjust terms, a feeling expressed in the Soviet-crafted UN General Assembly Resolution 3379. Meanwhile, the cause of the Palestinian people who had suffered mass displacement and deportation with the establishment of the state of Israel and the subsequent wars in the region was promoted and the USSR gave active support to certain Palestinian rebel groups whose primary method of struggle is characterised as terrorism, such as the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO). Lt. General Pacepa described operation \\"SIG\\" (‚ÄúZionist Governments‚Äù) that was devised in 1972 to turn the Arab world against Israel and the United States. According to Pacepa, the following organizations received assistance from the KGB and other Eastern Bloc intelligence services: PLO, National Liberation Army of Bolivia (created in 1964 with help from Ernesto Che Guevara), the National Liberation Army of Colombia (created in 1965 with help from Cuba), Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine in 1969, and the Secret Army for Liberation of Armenia in 1975.From Russia With Terror, FrontPageMagazine.com, interview with Ion Mihai Pacepa, March 1, 2004 The leader of the PLO, Yasser Arafat, established close collaboration with the Romanian Securitate service and the Soviet KGB in the beginning of the 1970s.The KGB and the Battle for the Third World, pages 250-253 The secret training of PLO guerrillas was provided by the KGB.The KGB and the Battle for the Third World, page 145 However, the main KGB activities and arms shipments were channeled through Wadie Haddad of the DFLP organization, who usually stayed in a KGB dacha (BARVIKHA-1) during his visits to the Soviet Union. Led by Carlos the Jackal, a group of PFLP fighters accomplished a spectacular raid on the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries office in Vienna in 1975. Advance notice of this operation \\"was almost certainly\\" given to the KGB. Faisal al-Shammeri credits Soviet special services with sponsoring international terrorist organizations that emerged in Libya in 70-80's, Palestine Liberation Organization, Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, as well as continuation of these policies after the fall of the USSR. The Red Army Faction in Germany was over years the supported by the Stasi, East Germany's security service. In 1978 part of the RAF group (Brigitte Mohnhaupt, Peter Boock, Rolf Wagner, Sieglinde Hoffmann) was hiding in a S≈Çu≈ºba Bezpiecze≈Ñstwa (SB) safe house in the Mazury district in Poland, where they escaped through Yugoslavia. During the stay, they were training together with Arab operatives and also hiding from German police during an intensive search for the group's members in West Germany. Carlos the Jackal and other prominent terrorists, such as Abu Nidal, Abu Daoud and Abu Abbas, enjoyed protection at SB safe houses in Poland, especially in the 1980s. Communist Poland was also used as a transit country for money and weapon transfers for these organisations. A number of notable operations have been conducted by the KGB to support international terrorists with weapons on the orders from the Soviet Communist Party, including: * Transfer of machine-guns, automatic rifles, Walther pistols, and cartridges to the Official Irish Republican Army by the Soviet intelligence vessel Reduktor (operation SPLASH) in 1972 to fulfill a personal request for arms from Michael O'Riordan.KGB in Europe, page 502 * Transfer of anti-tank grenade RPG-7 launchers, radio- controlled SNOP mines, pistols with silencers, machine guns, and other weaponry to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine through Wadi Haddad, who was recruited as a KGB agent in 1970 (operation VOSTOK, \\"East\\").This operation was sanctioned personally by Leonid Brezhnev in 1970. The weapons were delivered by the KGB vessel Kursograf. - KGB in Europe, pages 495-498 ==Cold War and terrorism== Large-scale sabotage operations may have been prepared by the KGB and GRU in case of war against the United States, Canada, United Kingdom and the rest of Europe, as alleged by intelligence historian Christopher Andrew in Mitrokhin ArchiveMitrokhin Archive, The KGB in Europe, page 472-476 and in books by former GRU and SVR officers Victor SuvorovVictor Suvorov, Spetsnaz, 1987, Hamish Hamilton Ltd, and Stanislav Lunev, and Kouzminov.Alexander Kouzminov Biological Espionage: Special Operations of the Soviet and Russian Foreign Intelligence Services in the West, Greenhill Books, 2006, Among the planned operations were the following: *Large arms caches were hidden in many countries for the planned terrorist acts. They were booby-trapped with \\"Lightning\\" explosive devices. One of such cache, which was identified by Mitrokhin, exploded when Swiss authorities tried to remove it from woods near Bern. Several others caches (probably not equipped with the \\"Lightnings\\") were removed successfully.The KGB in Europe, page 475-476 *Preparations for nuclear sabotage. Some of the hidden caches could contain portable tactical nuclear weapons known as RA-115 \\"suitcase bombs\\" prepared to assassinate US leaders in the event of war, according to GRU defector Stanislav Lunev.Stanislav Lunev. Through the Eyes of the Enemy: The Autobiography of Stanislav Lunev, Regnery Publishing, Inc., 1998. These portable bombs can last for many years if wired to an electric source. ‚ÄúIn case there is a loss of power, there is a battery backup. If the battery runs low, the weapon has a transmitter that sends a coded message ‚Äì either by satellite or directly to a GRU post at a Russian embassy or consulate.‚Äù Lunev states that he had personally looked for hiding places for weapons caches in the Shenandoah Valley area and that \\"it is surprisingly easy to smuggle nuclear weapons into the US\\", either across the Mexican border or using a small transport missile that can slip in undetected when launched from a Russian airplane. *Extensive sabotage plans in London, Washington, Paris, Bonn, Rome, and other Western capitals were revealed by KGB defector Oleg Lyalin in 1971, including a plan to flood the London underground and deliver poison capsules to Whitehall. This disclosure triggered the mass expulsion of Russian spies from London.KGB in Europe, page 499-500 *FSLN leader Carlos Fonseca Amador was described as \\"a trusted agent\\" in KGB files. \\"Sandinista guerrillas formed the basis for a KGB sabotage and intelligence group established in 1966 on the Mexican US border\\".The KGB in Europe, page 472-473 *Disruption of the power supply in all of New York State by KGB sabotage teams, which would be based along the Delaware River, in the Big Spring Park.The KGB in Europe, page 473 *An \\"immensely detailed\\" plan to destroy \\"oil refineries and oil and gas pipelines across Canada from British Columbia to Montreal\\" (operation \\"Cedar\\") had been prepared, which took twelve years to complete.The KGB in Europe, page 473-474 *A plan for sabotage of Hungry Horse Dam in Montana. *A detailed plan to destroy the port of New York (target GRANIT); the most vulnerable points of the port were marked on maps. According to Lunev, a probable scenario in the event of war would be poisoning of the Potomac River with chemical or biological weapons, \\"targeting the residents of Washington, D.C.\\" He also noted that it is \\"likely\\" that GRU operatives have placed already \\"poison supplies near the tributaries to major US reservoirs.\\"Lunev, pages 29-30 This information was confirmed by Alexander Kouzminov, who was responsible for transporting dangerous pathogens from around the world for the Soviet program of biological weapons in the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s. He described a variety of biological terrorist acts that would be carried out on the order of the Russian President in the event of hostilities, including poisoning public drinking-water supplies and food processing plants.Kusminov, pages 35-36. At the end of the 1980s, the Soviet Union \\"was the only country in the world that could start and win a global biological war, something we had already established that the West was not ready for,\\" according to Kouzminov. == See also == *Active measures *Communist terrorism *Iran and state-sponsored terrorism *Israel and state- sponsored terrorism *Pakistan and state-sponsored terrorism *Poison laboratory of the Soviet secret services *Qatar and state-sponsored terrorism *Saudi Arabia‚ÄìUnited States relations#Allegations of funding terrorism *State- sponsored terrorism#Soviet Union *Terrorism in Russia *United States and state-sponsored terrorism ==References== Soviet Union Category:Communist terrorism ","title":"Terrorism and the Soviet Union"},{"id":"20193895","text":"Central pain syndrome is a neurological condition consisting of constant, moderate to severe pain due to damage to the central nervous system (CNS) which causes a sensitization of the pain system. The extent of pain and the areas affected are related to the cause of the injury. ==Signs and symptoms== Pain can either be relegated to a specific part of the body or spread to the entire body. It is typically constant, and may be moderate to severe in intensity. It is often made worse by touch, movement, emotions, barometric pressure and temperature changes, usually cold temperatures along with many other similar 'triggers'. Burning pain is the most common sensation, but patients also report pins and needles, pressing, lacerating, aching, and extreme bursts or constant sharp or unremitting excruciating pain. Individuals may have reduced sensitivity to touch in the areas affected by the pain, as if the part is 'falling asleep'. The burning and loss of sense of touch are usually, but not always, most severe on the distant parts of the body, such as the feet or hands, spreading until it is in some cases felt from head to toe. For some patients with intense affliction, there often can be unremitting nausea, causing vomiting. The pain can also bring on hyperventilation. Blood pressure can rise due to the pain. FREE full text. Requires 2 minute registration with BMJ. == Cause == Damage to the CNS can be caused by car accidents, limb amputations, trauma, spinal cord injury, tumors, stroke, immune system disorders or diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's, Graves or Addison's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and epilepsy. It may develop months or years after injury or damage to the CNS. ==Diagnosis== A diagnosis of central pain syndrome is based upon identification of characteristic symptoms, a detailed patient history, a thorough clinical evaluation and a variety of specialized tests. Central pain syndrome is suspected in individuals who complain of pain or other abnormal sensations following injury to the central nervous system. Other conditions that cause pain may need to be excluded before a diagnosis of central pain syndrome is made. == Treatment == Pain medications often provide some reduction of pain, but not complete relief of pain, for those affected by central pain syndrome. Tricyclic antidepressants such as nortriptyline or anticonvulsants such as neurontin (gabapentin) can be useful, but also provide incomplete relief. Lowering stress levels appears to reduce pain. For regular treatment some people prefer body length heating pads while others rely on warm baths. == Prognosis == Central pain syndrome is not a fatal disorder, but the syndrome causes disabling chronic pain and suffering among the majority of individuals who have it. ==See also== * Thalamic syndrome ==ReferencesFurther reading== Canavero S, & Bonicalzi V (2007) Central pain syndrome.

It is the only of MKS series of synthesizers to have fully analog voltage-controlled oscillators. Contrary to popular belief, the voice architecture is more closely related to the Jupiter-6 synthesizer than the Jupiter-8, the service manual states that \\"The module board of MKS-80 features the following in addition to that of JP-6, its brother module. 1) HPF. 2) Low boost circuit in the 2nd VCA. 3) DC supply current boost circuit (IC50).\\" The unit is fully capable of producing most of the Jupiter-8's signature sounds, in addition to many sounds unique to the MKS-80. In February 1985, Roland started producing a new revision of MKS-80, known as \\"Rev 5\\", that had no ties with any previous Jupiter's hardware, as it used a new generation of both Roland VCO's, VCA's and filter. The Rev 5 filter was also used in JX-8P, JX-10 and MKS-70 synthesizers. ==Features== The voice architecture of the MKS-80 is fully analog with 8 polyphonic voices with 2 voltage controlled oscillators (VCO) per voice, using the Curtis CEM3340 VCO integrated circuit. The unit also includes one voltage controlled filter (VCF) and one voltage controlled amplifier (VCA) per voice. The MKS-80 has a 64 patch internal memory (8 banks of 8 patches each) along with an optional memory cartridge called the M-64C with room for another 128 (2 banks of 64 each). A full MIDI implementation is built into the MKS-80, with MIDI IN, OUT and THRU jacks positioned at the rear of the unit. ==External Programmer== The MPG-80 is the optional programmer designed specifically for the MKS-80, providing direct access to the majority of the MKS-80's features. The MPG-80 connects to the MKS-80 via the Controller port using a special cable. When used with an MPG-80, the MKS-80's MIDI IN port is not used in favor of the MIDI IN on the MPG-80. ==Factory Presets== The Factory Presets were created by Eric Persing and Dan Desousa ==Notable users== * Andy Whitmore (Record Producer / Keyboard Player, London UK) * Walter Afanasieff * Blancmange * John Carpenter * Hans Zimmer * Harold Faltermeyer * Herbie Hancock * Klaus Schulze * Madonna ‚Äì bass in \\"Into The Groove\\", \\"La Isla Bonita\\", \\"Open Your Heart\\", \\"Who's That Girl\\" * Vince Clarke * Snap!

The film is one of the few surviving Expressionist films from Austria and has therefore been well researched. The film was first shown on 25 July 1924 in Vienna. In his novel, published in 1922, Hugo Bettauer succeeded in creating a relatively accurate allegorical vision of the near future, although the book was intended as entertainment and as a satirical response to the primitive antisemitism of the 1920s. It immediately became Bettauer's most popular work: it was translated into several languages, and sold over a quarter of a million copies. Shortly after the premiere of the film Hugo Bettauer was murdered by Otto Rothstock, a former member of the Nazi Party, who was lionized by the antisemitic Austrian masses and was released less than two years after having been committed to a psychiatric institution. == Plot == In Austria the Christian Social Party comes to power, and the new Chancellor Dr. Schwerdtfeger, a fanatical antisemite, sees his people as being ruled by the Jews. He therefore has a law passed by the National Assembly forcing all Jews to emigrate by the end of the year. The law is enthusiastically received by the non-Jewish population, and the Jews leave the country. But after a short time a sober reality makes itself felt. Cultural life becomes impoverished: in the theatres only plays by Ludwig Ganghofer and Ludwig Anzengruber are still performed. Many cafes are empty, or are converted into beer halls selling sausages. After an initial upturn, the economy declines, as business has greatly diminished, and has moved to other cities, such as Prague and Budapest. Inflation and unemployment run wild. The political characters of the book (although not of the film, to avoid difficulties with censorship) are delineated in such a way as to be identifiable with real politicians of the period: Bundeskanzler Schwerdtfeger, for example, is based on Ignaz Seipel. Besides the political action, the film also dwells on the love relationship between Lotte (Anny Milety), a typical Viennese girl (Wiener M√§del) and the daughter of a member of the National Assembly who voted for the banishment of the Jews, and the Jewish artist Leo Strakosch (Johannes Riemann). Towards the end of the film, the National Assembly resolves to bring the Jews back again. However, to achieve the necessary two-thirds majority, Lotte and Leo, who has already illegally returned to Austria with forged papers identifying him as a French painter, have to remove the antisemitic parliamentary representative Bernard (played by Hans Moser), which they do by getting him drunk. The drama reaches a peak as he is committed to a psychiatric institution represented in Expressionist scenery, where in a claustrophobic and asymmetrically painted cell, he sees himself threatened by Stars of David. This sequence also represents the divergence of the film from the book, as the action of the film is revealed as a dream of the antisemitic Councillor Bernard. This surprising turn of events was described in the original film program as: \\"In this moment of the highest distress Councillor Bernard awakes from his dream, finds himself in the tavern at a very late hour and says to the baffled Volbert: 'Thank God that stupid dream is over‚Äîwe are all just people and we don't want hate‚Äîwe want life‚Äîwe want to live together in peace.'\\"\\"Gottlob, da√ü der dumme Traum vorbei ist ‚Äì wir sind ja alle nur Menschen und wollen keinen Ha√ü ‚Äì Leben wollen wir ‚Äì ruhig nebeneinander leben\\". Kivur, Nr. 1346, o.J., o.S. == Background == The film was made in 1924, about two years after the publication of Bettauer's novel. It differs from the book in several ways: for example, the city in the film is called \\"Utopia\\", instead of \\"Vienna\\". The film also has conciliatory happy ending, which is not only the exact opposite of the message of the book, but also represents a surprising and abrupt change of direction within the film itself, the whole of which is thus revealed as the dream of an antisemite who at last comes to the realisation that the Jews are a \\"necessary evil\\".Die Filmwelt, 1924, n. 14‚Äì15, pp. 6‚Äì7 The reason for these fundamental deviations from the original was to reduce the controversial political impact of the content. The film was Hans Moser's second cinematic role. The female lead was played, as so often in Breslauer's films, by Anny (or Anna) Milety, whom he later married (in 1925). The well-known Jewish actors Gisela Werbisek (billed as \\"Werbezirk\\") and Armin Berg appeared only in minor roles, as Kathi the cook and Isidor the commissionaire. The Expressionist backdrops and decor which characterise some scenes were the work of Julius von Borsody. Other cast members were Eugen Neufeld (Bundeskanzler Dr. Schwerdtfeger), Karl Thema (Cllr. Linder), Ferdinand Mayerhofer (Cllr. Volbert), Mizzi Griebl (Volbert's wife) and Hans Effenberger (Alois Carroni). == Performance history == The premiere took place on 25 July 1924 in Vienna, although there were still technical problems with the film. Bettauer and Breslauer, the director, fell out entirely, and Bettauer later refused to acknowledge any connection between the film and his book. The technically inferior prints of the film were often manually cut and shortened by the cinema owners themselves. Nevertheless, the cinema auditoriums were often full, although not only in Austria but also in Berlin (premiere 1926) and New York (premiere 1928, where it was shown as The City Without Jews), it was very clear that the success of the film was not as great as that of the book. There were sometimes disturbances at performances: National Socialists often threw stinkbombs into the cinemas; in Linz the showing of the film was banned.Heimo Halbrainer on www.korso.at ‚Äì Informationsmagazin f√ºr die Steiermark, July 2001 (retrieved 19 January 2008) A campaign of vilification against Bettauer was instigated, partly because of this film and partly because of his other activities. In the spring of 1925 he was murdered by a Nazi Party member, Otto Rothstock, who was hailed as a hero and despite being found guilty of murder, was sent to a mental hospital and, after 18 months, set free. A fair amount of money was collected from the general public for him. In 1933, the film was shown commercially for the last time, again causing a stir, when it was screened in the Amsterdam theatre Carr√© as a protest against Hitler's Germany. This copy of the film is presumably the same as the one discovered in 1991 in the Nederlands Filmmuseum. It was on a cellulose nitrate base and on the point of disintegration, as well as being incomplete. The German Bundesarchiv in Coblenz therefore made an \\"emergency copy\\", which was then reconstructed on behalf of the Filmarchiv Austria (Austrian Film Archive) by the company HS-ART Digital Service of Graz using the \\"DIAMANT\\" software developed by Joanneum Research; faded parts were then re-coloured. In October 2008, the film was made available on a portable medium for the first time as part of the DVD series Der √∂sterreichische Film. In 2015, a copy of the whole film in excellent condition was found in a flea-market in Paris. The Austrian Film Archive organised a crowd-funding campaign to save the film to which more than 700 people contributed more than ‚Ç¨86,000 (¬£72,000; $107,000). This full version of the film was digitally restored and re-released in 2018.(29 March 2018). \\"'Lost' film predicting rise of Nazism returns to screen\\".

The key in the deinking process is the ability to detach ink from the fibers. This is achieved by a combination of mechanical action and chemical means. In Europe the most common process is froth flotation deinking. Paper is one of the main targets for recycling. A concern about recycling wood pulp paper is that the fibers are degraded with each cycle and after being recycled 4‚Äì6 times the fibers become too short and weak to be useful in making paper. ==History== Before the invention of the paper machine in 1799 the most common fibre source was recycled fibres from used textiles, hence the name rag paper. The rags were from hemp, linen and cotton. It was not until the introduction of wood pulp in 1843 that paper production was independent of recycled materials. Recycling of used paper before the industrialisation of paper production, rag paper was recycled to make low-grade board. A process for removing printing inks from recycled paper was invented by German jurist Justus Claproth in 1774. He practiced together with German paper producer Johann Engelhard Schmid. Today this method is called deinking. First in the 1950s and 1960s the use of recycled fibres from paper made of wood pulp begun to increase, and was mainly used in packaging paper and paperboard. In the 1950s the froth flotation technique was adapted for deinking recycled paper. Use of recovered paper increased in the 1970s mainly in graphic and hygienic papers, and accelerated in the 1980s. The annual growth in use of recovered paper increased by 6% between 1980 and 1996. The use of virgin fibres only increased 2% in the same period. In 1997 recovered paper production was 42% of the total paper production. ==Deinking process== Schematic layout of a deinking plant. ===Sorting=== Waste paper may contain a mixture of different paper types made of mixtures of different paperfibers. These must be sorted before processed. Broke (paper waste from paper production) is normally used directly in the papermachine. * Office waste (OW) * Old magazine papers (OMP) * Old newsprint (ONP) * Paperboard * Corrugated fiberboard Recycled paper can be used to make paper of the same or lower quality than it was originally. The sorted paper is baled and shipped to a papermill. The pulpmill uses waste paper grade according to the paper quality they want to make. ===Debaling=== The bales are opened and large foreign objects are sorted out on the conveyor belt to the pulper. Many extraneous materials are readily removed. Twine, strapping, etc. are removed from the hydropulper by a \\"ragger\\". Metal straps and staples can be screened out or removed by a magnet. Film-backed pressure-sensitive tape stays intact: the PSA adhesive and the backing are both removed together. ===Pulping=== Pulpers are either batch, which uses a tub with a high shear rotor, or continuous, using a long, perforated drum. Drum pulpers are very expensive but have the advantage of not breaking up contaminants, thus giving cleaner end product. The pulper chops the paper to smaller pieces; water and chemicals are added. Normally the pH is adjusted to 8.5 - 10.0. Normal deinking chemicals are: * pH control: sodium silicate or sodium hydroxide * Bleaching: hydrogen peroxide * Calcium ion source: hard water, lime or calcium chloride * Collector: fatty acid, fatty acid emulsion, fatty acid soap or organo-modified siloxane After pulping, the mixture is a slurry. The slurry goes to screening. ===Cleaning and screening=== Centrifugal cleaning is spinning the pulp slurry in a cleaner, causing materials that are denser than pulp fibers to move outward and be rejected. Screens, with either slots or holes, are used to remove contaminants that are larger than pulp fibers. Materials which are more difficult to remove include wax coatings on corrugated cartons and stickies, soft rubbery particles which can make deposits and contaminate the recycled paper. Stickies can originate from book bindings, hot melt adhesives, PSA adhesives from paper labels, laminating adhesives of reinforced gummed tapes, etc. ===Deinking stage=== In the deinking stage the goal is to release and remove the hydrophobic contaminants from the recycled paper. The contaminants are mostly printing ink and stickies. Several processes are used, most commonly flotation or washing. Flotation deinking Diagram of a froth flotation cell. Froth flotation was adapted from the flotation process used in the mining industry in the 1960s. It is the most common deinking process in Europe used to recover recycled paper. Often most of the collector is added to the inlet of the flotation. The process temperatures are normally in the range 45 - 55 ¬∞C. Air is blown into the pulp suspension. The collector has affinity both to the ink particles and air bubbles, causing them to attach. The air bubbles lift the ink to the surface and form a thick froth that can be removed. Normally the setup is a two-stage system with 3, 4 or 5 flotation cells in series.Voith EcoCell flotation plant Flotation deinking is very effective in removing ink particles larger than about 10 ¬µm. Wash deinking Wash deinking consists of a washing stage where dispersants are added to wash out the printing inks. When the pulp slurry is dewatered (thickened), the medium to fine particles are washed out. This process is most useful for removing particles smaller than about 30 ¬µm, like water-based inks, fillers, coating particles, fines and micro stickies. This process is more common when making deinked pulp for tissue. The processing equipment are belt filters, pressure belt filters, disk filters and static filters. This stage is much more efficient than normal washing / dewatering stages. Combined washing and flotation High quality deinking of office wastes and other printing papers often commonly uses a combination of washing and flotation. Enzymatic deinking This method of deinking uses industrial or food grade enzymes in conjunction with flotation deinking to aid in the removal of inks in recycling mills. More efficient removal of ink increases fiber yield, decreases dirt count, and increases paper brightness. Often the use of enzymatic deinking helps mills reduce their bleach usage or use cheaper furnish. Other deinking processes Dissolved air flotation (DAF) is used by some mills in the deinking stage and will remove some ink and filler (ash); however, it is mainly used to clarify the process water. ===Washing / dewatering=== Washing / dewatering (thickening) is a filtration process. Small particles (< 5 ¬µm) are removed by passing water through the pulp. ===Bleaching=== If white paper is desired, bleaching uses peroxides or hydrosulfites to increase the brightness of the pulp. The bleaching methods are similar for mechanical pulp, but the goal is to make the fiber brighter. ===Papermaking=== The deinked fiber is made into a new paper product in the same way that virgin wood fiber, see papermaking. ===Byproducts=== The unusable material left over, mainly ink, plastics, filler and short fibers, is called sludge. The sludge is buried in a landfill, burned to create energy at the paper mill or used as a fertilizer by local farmers. ===Problems=== Water based flexographic printing inks with particle sizes below 5 ¬µm and poor solubility in alkaline conditions may cause problems in deinking, especially in the flotation stage. The solution is to use an extra acidic washing stage. Temperature control is important as this affects the stickiness of stickies. Additional issues arise when taking into account the number of chemicals potentially present in paper for recycling. Studies have indicated that paper might contain as many as 10,000 different chemicals, fate of which in the deinking process still remains unknown. Polychlorinated biphenyls are often found in pigments which are used in newspaper and magazine paper. ==See also== * Dissolved air flotation * Environmental issues with paper * Froth flotation * German inventors and discoverers * Paper recycling * Pulp & Paper chemicals ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Category:Papermaking Category:Industrial processes Category:Paper recycling Category:German inventions ","title":"Deinking"},{"id":"20194186","text":"Baphukhola is a village development committee in Salyan District in the Rapti Zone of western-central Nepal.

June 1958 -- \\"I am working with Fellini and Tullio Pinelli, dusting off an old idea of ours for a film, the one about a young provincial who comes to Rome to become a journalist. Fellini wants to adapt the idea to the present day, to paint a picture of this ‚Äúwog society‚Äù that frolics between eroticism, alienation, boredom and sudden affluence. It is a society which, the terrors of the cold war now past and perhaps even in reaction to them, flourishes a bit everywhere. But in Rome, through a mixing together of the sacred and the profane, of the old and the new, through the en masse arrival of foreigners, through the cinema, presents more aggressive, subtropical qualities.

Chief Constable of the Cheshire Constabulary Peter Fahy called for the legal age of buying alcohol to increase to the age of 21 as a result of the Garry Newlove murder. His widow Helen Newlove condemned the Government for failing to get to grips with youth disorder afterwards. ==Victim== Garry Newlove was born in Salford, on 5 November 1959, the youngest of three children born to Thomas Edward Newlove (1913‚Äì1979) and his wife Ellen (1919‚Äì2002). He was married to Helen Marston from 1986 until his death, and had three daughters who were born between 1989 and 1994. He was diagnosed with stomach cancer in August 1992 and made a full recovery from surgery to have his stomach and spleen removed. By 2007, he was living in Padgate, Warrington, and was working as a sales manager for a local plastics company. ==Incident and arrests== Newlove was attacked outside his house in Station Road North in the Padgate district of Warrington, Cheshire, on the evening of 10 August 2007, having gone outside to confront a gang of youths he suspected of vandalising his wife's car. He died in hospital in the early hours of 12 August 2007, less than 36 hours after the attack. The murder was the culmination of numerous incidents of anti-social behaviour by youth gangs in and around Padgate, which had started several years earlier. Nine suspects were quickly arrested, and five were charged with his murder on 14 August 2007 and remanded in custody. A fourth teenager was charged and remanded the next day and the fifth and final suspect was charged and remanded on 13 September. Adam Swellings, 19, from Crewe, went on trial at Chester Crown Court charged with the murder on 14 November 2007, along with two 17-year-olds, a 16-year-old and a 15-year-old who could not be named for legal reasons. ==Verdicts and aftermath== On 16 January 2008, Adam Swellings was convicted of the murder of Garry Newlove, along with 17-year-old Stephen Sorton and 16-year-old Jordan Cunliffe. The two other defendants were cleared of any involvement in the killing and walked free from court.Swellings, Sorton and Cunliffe were remanded in custody until being sentenced to life imprisonment on 11 February 2008. The trial judge recommended that Swellings, Sorton and Cunliffe should serve minimum terms of 17, 15 and 12 years respectively ‚Äì sentences which were widely described as lenient by the victim's family and friends, as well as the tabloid media ‚Äì as these sentences meant that the youngest of the three killers could be out of prison by the age of 28, and the oldest was likely to be paroled in his mid thirties. Garry Newlove's murder was one of a number of high profile, widely reported murders in England during the late 2000s which highlighted the rise of crime involving youth gangs. Other comparable murders around the same time which attracted national attention were the murders of Tom ap Rhys Pryce (2006), Sophie Lancaster (2007), Rhys Jones (2007), Jimmy Mizen (2008) and Ben Kinsella (2008), all of which were committed by teenagers. Since the trial, Garry Newlove's widow Helen Newlove has actively campaigned through the media for more support for victims of crime, and for more severe sentences for criminals, as well as working with communities and working to reduce crime. ==Appeals== Swellings and Sorton appealed against their convictions and sentences. Their case was heard at the Court of Appeal on 13 November 2008. Swellings lost the appeal against his conviction and sentence, although Sorton won a two-year reduction on his minimum sentence. Cunliffe later appealed against his murder conviction on the grounds that he had not taken part in the attack on Mr Newlove, although he had been present when it happened. On 26 July 2010, the Court of Appeal dismissed his appeal. He is now reported to be challenging his murder conviction (obtained on the grounds of joint enterprise as he reportedly did not take part in the attack despite being present when the others took part) on the grounds that he could barely see the attack taking place due to a degenerative eye condition, which he and his supporters (including his mother Janet) claim would make him not guilty of murder. The campaign also calls for an end to the ability of the legal system to secure a murder conviction against someone on the grounds of joint enterprise if they were present but did not actually commit the killing. In December 2014, it was reported that Cunliffe's murder conviction would be reviewed at a later date in a re-examination of the joint enterprise law regarding murder. In December 2019, the Parole Board recommended that Jordan Cunliffe (now aged 28) should be released from prison, but on 14 May 2020 it was reported that Cunliffe had been denied parole following reports that he had held an alcohol-fuelled party in his prison cell at an open prison to celebrate his impending release. He had since been returned to closed conditions in another prison. In February 2020, the Parole Board also recommended that Steven Sorton (now aged 29) should be released from prison.He is believed to have been paroled the following month. ==Popular culture== The screenwriter Jimmy McGovern later used the case of Jordan Cunliffe as a basis for a new television drama.

They have also been sighted along the Atlantic coast of France. It is a rare visitor to the seas off the southern British Isles (the related A. punctata is regular along most British coasts, as well as the northeast Atlantic).

Aplysia fasciata can grow to sizes up to 40 cm long. Coloring is often black or a very dark brown, sometimes with a thin red border to the parapodia, foot, and tentacles. Many also have mottled spots which span across their body, earning the name \\"mottled sea hare\\". Aplysia fasciata have, like most sea slugs, two oral tentacles and two more smaller rhinopores in front on their neck. Eyes are positioned in front of the rhinopores. Small, rounded \\"tails\\" are fixed to their hindside. A mantle covers its gills and internal organs. Inside the mantle, a thin, delicate inner shell lays. The shell is concave, with amber coloring and a slightly hooked apex. Inside the mantle is the ink gland. == Behavior == Paradopia of a Aplysia fasciata while swimming, from above. Aplysia fasciata eat algae and seaweed attached to rocks and other surfaces. They are often seen swimming in groups, along tide pools and rocks. These sea hares also secrete a sort of ink.

It was released in 2008 by ALM Records. \\"Silenziosa luna\\" is a quotation from Giacomo Leopardi's poem Canto notturno di un pastore errante dell'Asia. ==Description== The album includes works written by Forlivesi between 1999 and 2008. Its 28-page booklet reflects the artistic and cultural concerns of the team about this recording. The linear notes provide information about the musicians and lyrics, and give details on the extent of each musical work, placing them in cultural and creative contexts. They were written in Italian originally and directly translated into Japanese and English, respectively by Japanese musicologist Mariko Kanemitsu and British composer/poet Jeremy Drake. Japanese jiuta-mai dancer Sayuri Uno, American academic Laura Hein (Northwestern University) and Italian philosopher Marco Forlivesi (University of Padua) also made a significant contribution to this process. The recording gathers accomplished masters and new-generation virtuosos, while the instrumental techniques developed on purpose for these works are likely to be among the most demanding ever written for these instruments. The recording technology employed (24bit/96kHz) brings forth clarity of sound and dynamics, delicacy and a high dynamic range, with a main focus on timbre, textures and transparency. The artistic photograph reproduced on the album cover is a shot taken by Carlo Forlivesi and Sayuri Uno in \\"Shisend≈ç\\", a historic spot in Kyoto; it represents a round-shaped Tsukubai enhanced by natural shadows and reflections. In spite of the apparent complexity of the layers it is a non- processed image. The disc fits the same round-shaped Tsukubai picture finely emulated with sprinkled silver and gold colors, and bears a strong resemblance to maki-e making. ==Performers== *Yukio Tanaka voice and biwa *Kumiko Shuto voice and biwa *Yosuke Irie shakuhachi *Ayako Shigenari 13-string koto and 20-string koto *Norio Sato guitar == Track listing == *1.

He commanded the Prince of Wales' American Regiment, a Loyalist regiment, in the American Revolutionary War. He served as lieutenant governor of West Florida from 1766 to 1769, acting as governor from 1767, and then as governor of the Bahamas from 1774 to 1780. ==Life== Montfort Browne was from an Irish family. According to his own writings, he served in the 35th Regiment of Foot during the Seven Years' War, where he saw much action in the West Indies, and was twice wounded. In 1763 a complaint was lodged against him that resulted in an unfavourable court of inquiry against him. When the British took control of West Florida after the war, Browne sponsored French Huguenot and Irish immigrants to the area. Through a patronage connection with the colonial secretary, the Earl of Hillsborough, he secured the lieutenant governorship of the new province in November 1764. Accompanied by his Irish recruits, he arrived at the provincial capital, Pensacola, in January 1766. ===West Florida=== His first year as lieutenant governor was turbulent. Some of his land claims were contested, and the property he owned on Dauphin Island was found to be unsuitable for the population he had planned to settle there. His relationship with Governor George Johnstone was strained when Browne sided with the military in disputes between them and the governor. Johnstone left West Florida in January 1767, leaving Browne in command of the province. Browne in 1768 led a successful expedition to the region of Natchez, bringing back a report of the fertility of the land and its lack of population, and suggesting that it be developed. For his services in the war he had been awarded in the province, and he used the trip to stake out large parcels of land on the eastern banks of the Mississippi River, just north of present-day Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Irregularities in Browne's bookkeeping in 1768 drew criticism from his patron Hillsborough, and Browne formally requested that his books be audited when Johnstone's successor John Eliot arrived in April 1769. Unfortunately, Eliot committed suicide a month after his arrival, and Browne reluctantly retook the reins of power. He sent the provincial surveyor, Elias Durnford, to London in May 1769 to answer ongoing complaints that colonists were making against him, but Durnford returned that December with orders removing Browne from power and granting Durnford an acting governorship. As Browne was preparing to leave the province, he was involved in a duel with a Pensacolan trader. The man was wounded, and Browne would have faced criminal charges had the man died. Fortunately for Browne he recovered, and Browne sailed for England in February 1770. He spent much of the next two years in England, having his finances scrutinized by the colonial office, and continuing to drum up interest in settlements on the Mississippi. There was public speculation on both sides of the Atlantic that the Mississippi lands would eventually be separated into their own province, with Browne as its governor. Hillsborough was apparently supportive of the idea, and resigned as colonial secretary when it was rejected. Browne continued to lobby Hillsborough's successor, the Earl of Dartmouth, for the establishment of a province on the Mississippi, but was unsuccessful. He was instead eventually granted the governorship of the Bahamas in March 1774. ===Bahamas and Revolutionary War service=== While governor of the Bahamas, Browne continued to promote the desirability of land on the Mississippi. At one point he advertised for sale tracts of land as large as , suggesting that he had acquired more land while in England. He made several trips from the Bahamas to West Florida to pursue his interests in 1774 and 1775. After the American Revolutionary War broke out in 1775, he took some precautions to secure Nassau. He had had ample warning that the Americans might make an attack there, but was caught off guard when American ships arrived off Nassau's sandbar at the entrance to its port on the morning of 3 March 1776. He rushed to Government House in his nightshirt to order the firing of cannon to summon the militia. Though he managed to get most of the island's gunpowder stores away to St. Augustine, Florida, he failed to hold the island and was taken prisoner. With 12 other high-ranking hostages from the island he was taken back to the Chesapeake Bay by the American fleet, and was released, in part, by the efforts of his friend Timothy Hierlihy, in exchange for William Alexander. Browne then formed the Loyalist Prince of Wales' American Regiment, served at the siege of Rhode Island, and spent some time in Florida before finally returning to the Bahamas to resume his post there in July 1778. He then faced accusations of cowardice and incompetence for his conduct of the battle and, after dismissing his council in an attempt to scotch the rumours (an unprecedented move), he was replaced by John Robert Maxwell two years later in 1780. ==Bibliography== *Michael Craton, Gail Saunders, Islanders in the Stream *David J.

P. howardii can be found in citrus furrow irrigation systems in coastal southeastern Florida; it oviposits low in the furrows. The eggs hatch by rainfall and irrigation. ==Larvae== The larvae occur from March to October, and can be found in unshaded or partly shaded temporary rain-filled pools. They are large, and prey on the larvae of other mosquitoes. To collect a field sample, a long-handled dipper causes a minimum of disturbance to the larvae. An area sampler is used after the dipper which catches more. ==References== Category:Aedini Category:Diptera of North America Category:Insects described in 1901 ","title":"Psorophora howardii"},{"id":"20194411","text":"Ibrahim Hazimeh (born 1933 in Acco, Palestine) is a Palestinian artist. ==Career== United Buddy Bear for Palestine, designed by Ibrahim Hazimeh, here: exhibition in Warsaw 2008 In 1948, he and his family suffered expulsion and they lived in Lebanon and Lattakia, Syria as refugees.

Day Giant Resin Bee Virginia Cooperative Extension - Publications and Educational Resources ==Habitat== In the United States, these resin bees occur in nests of Xylocopa spp., often around wooden structures such as doors, decks and porches. ==Biology== Adults can be found from June to-September. These solitary bees are known to make during the summer their nests in available holes found in wooden structures or in small crevices between wood boards and often they use cavities belonging to carpenter bees. They do not bore holes into wood. Their individual cells are constructed using wood particles and mud. They provide each cell with pollen carried on the underside of their hairy abdomen. Then they lay in each cell a single egg. Females also use their large jaws to collect resin (hence the common name), used to cap the brood cells. The larvae overwinter inside the cells, consuming the pollen. In spring they pupate and emerge as an adult in early summer. The main recorded host plants are Lathyrus latifolius and Sophora japonica (Fabaceae), Pycnanthemum species (Lamiaceae), Lythrum salicaria (Lythraceae), Koelreuteria paniculata (Sapindaceae) and Buddleia species (Scrophulariaceae). ==Gallery== File: Megachile sculpturalis, female, back 2012-07-12-17.20 (22479798836).jpg Mounted specimen.

The book was described by F. Scott Fitzgerald as the \\"textbook\\" of his generation. Stover at Yale recounts Dink Stover's navigation through the social structure at Yale and his struggles with social pressure. ==Plot summarySetting the Stage (Chapters 1-3)=== The story opens with a picture of Stover seating himself on a train bound for New Haven. A short account is given of Stover's background from his Lawrenceville School days (recounted in The Varmint). He overcame a poor start at the prep school and gained a reputation in football and as a class leader. While Stover is poised in dress and bearing, his classmates appear more eager and juvenile. Stover listens to them talk and learns of the secret society system, which will be the main drama of the plot. Later, the tap ceremony for the Yale senior society Skull and Bones is vividly described. While on the train, Stover also meets Tom Regan, an older, physically imposing and more open classmate of his, as well as LeBaron, a leading sophomore who is already taking Stover under his wing. Arriving at his campus lodgings, Stover meets several more characters who will play parts in the following chapters. With Tough McCarty, his rival became friend from Lawrenceville days, Stover has a joyous roughhouse. He also meets McNabb, who is the \\"partier\\" of the freshman class. With Hunter, who is reserved and poised for leadership, Stover instantly feels rivalry. A sophomore, Reynolds, \\"an undersized nervous fellow\\" but first in his class to \\"make the News\\", stops by to check on the Andover freshmen in the house. He evaluates each man and advises him on what to go after in terms of extracurriculars. Some comic relief is afforded when Rogers, a junior stops by, and the tone changes to Reynolds deferring while Rogers leads the group in antagonizing a group of sophomores by turning lights on and off. The chapter concludes with Stover's dinner with LeBaron. LeBaron counsels Stover on the importance of winning election to a secret society. Stover is troubled by the status given to this social positioning. Back with Tough, Stover tells him to \\"go slow\\" about making new friendships, nixing Tough's plan for a dining group, but has difficulty explaining his thinking. ===Establishing himself in the class (Chapters 4-27)=== The action then shifts to the gridiron. Stover performs well at basic drills, but gets no praise and is not called on to scrimmage. Tompkins, one of the coaches, cautions him, \\"Stover, just one word for your good. You come up with a big prep school reputation. Don't make an ass of yourself.\\" Later, Stover meets Gimbal, who openly proclaims a plan to fight the society system. Gimbal is also open about looking for political leadership with his anti-society stance. The two shake hands, but Stover is uncertain what to make of Gimbal. In the evening, Stover and his class take part in wrestling contests against the sophomores. When no one from his class will stand in as the middleweight, Stover volunteers, though he knows no wrestling. Stover uses his football tackling power to beat his opponent, despite the other man's better knowledge of wrestling. Dana, the football captain, and Tompkins, the coach, see Stover's incredible tackling power and recognize him for it, enthusiastically and sparingly. Stover is borne home by his classmates, having established himself as a name in the class. Stover reconnects with Regan, who had avoided the wrestling match and the first week of practice, despite his huge size, preferring to concentrate on personal affairs and school. Stover also meets other members of the class: Bob Story, son of an influential judge, as well as Joe Hungerford, a \\"name known across the world for power in finance.\\" Stover, with Hungerford's encouragement, persuades Regan to become the waiter for their dining club. In football practice, Stover at first is disappointed that his wrestling heroics do not suddenly win him a place on the team, but eventually he gets placed as the end on the scrub team. He battles a senior, Bangs, who is the starting end, and outplays him dramatically. Bangs resents Stover's presence as threatening a position that he spent three years building toward. ==Publication history== Stover at Yale was originally serialized in McClure's in 1911. The copyright has expired and the work has passed into public domain. ==Commentary and reviews== There were varied reactions to the book.STOVER AT YALE.

The junction gives access from the ECML to the Skellow line of the West Riding and Grimsby Railway and eventually to Hull, Immingham and Grimsby Docks. ==History== The halt consisted of two flanking platforms to the south of the level crossing, with brick-built station buildings on the York-bound side. These buildings still stand in private use. The station was set in the countryside, with just a few cottages situated either side at some distance. The station was not shown in railway timetables as it was only for the use of platelayers and crossing keepers (and their families) to enable them to get into, and out of, Doncaster for weekend shopping. The station opened and closed in the 1950s. In May 2011, Network Rail applied to the Infrastructure Planning Commission for permission to construct a North Doncaster chord to link two lines, the Askern line and the Skellow line, with a viaduct passing above Joan Croft junction. The aim of the project was to eliminate the need to use the ECML for slow-moving, westbound bulk freight trains from the Humber ports, in particular, coal from Immingham to Ferrybridge power station. As part of the proposed works, the Joan Croft level crossing was closed and replaced by a road bridge. Closing the level crossing allowed engineers to lower the overhead wires on the ECML (because the wires no longer had to be higher than the highest road vehicle plus a safety margin), thus allowing the new railway viaduct to be constructed at a lower level.

Between 1960 and 1959, Leshchenko worked as a stage helper at the State Academic Bolshoi Theatre, and before being conscripted into the army in 1961, he worked as an adjuster at a precision measuring instrument factory. Leschenko served in the mechanical vehicle division of the Soviet Army, positioned in the German Democratic Republic. On 27 January 1962, Leshchenko (then a private) became a soloist within the Soviet Red Army Ensemble, and received the offer to remain in the army. Leshchenko accepted every role offered to him by the ensemble, namely singing in a quarter, conducting concerts and even reading verses, where it is often said to have begun his entertainment career. At the same time, he was preparing for theatrical examinations for Russian Academy of Theatre Arts (abbreviated as GITIS), the most respected theatrical school of the Soviet Union, which he passed and was successfully admitted to in September 1964.Russiansabroad.com Leshchenko began touring with concert bands, visiting some of the more isolated parts of the country. In 1969, Leshchenko was admitted as a member of the Moscow Operetta Theatre. He experienced with many roles, but was aware of his musical gift, and was constantly seeking for soloist acts. On 13 February 1970, having successfully gone through a contest held by the state radio station, Leshchenko became a solo vocalist for the Soviet state radio station. In 1975, Leshchenko performed \\"Den Pobedy\\" (an immensely popular Soviet song dedicated to the Victory Day, which was initially disliked by the authorities due to the unconventional music style).

The troughs were financed by a trust fund established through the will of George Bills. A total of around 700 troughs were distributed by the trust in Australia and 50 in several other countries. ==George and Annis Bills== George Bills was born in Brighton in England in 1859. He migrated with his family to New Zealand and subsequently to Echuca, Victoria in Australia in 1873. In 1882 he opened a bird dealers shop in Brisbane, where he met and married Annis Swann who had immigrated from Sheffield in England. In 1884 the couple moved to Sydney and George Bills went into business with his brothers, manufacturing innerspring mattresses. In 1908, George retired to Hawthorn, Victoria and in 1910, Annis died while the couple were visiting England. George became a Life Governor of the RSPCA in 1924. ==Trust fund== Newtown, Victoria George and Annis had no children, and following the death of George in 1927, a trust fund was set up, believed to be around ¬£70-80,000. One of the purposes of the trust, as set out in George Bills' will, was to: :\\"..construct and erect and pay for horse troughs wherever they may be of the opinion that such horse troughs are desirable for the relief of horses and other dumb animals either in Australasia, in the British Islands or in any other part of the world subject to the consent of the proper authorities being obtained.\\" Each trough cost ¬£13 plus transport and installation . The majority of the troughs were installed in Victoria and New South Wales between 1930 and 1939. Initially the troughs were individually designed and constructed, however by the early 1930s, J.B. Phillips, a relative of the Bills, became the head contractor. Working to a standard design he produced the troughs in Auburn Road in Hawthorn. The troughs were pre-cast concrete with a curved pediment with the inscription \\"Donated by Annis & George Bills Australia\\". Manufacture was subsequently handled by Rocla, who produced troughs to the same design in Victoria and later in Junee in New South Wales. With the rise of motorised transport, demand for the troughs declined and production had ceased by the end of World War II. Aside from the horse troughs, the trust was involved with other animal welfare projects including the establishment of the George Bills RSPCA Rescue Centre at Burwood East, Victoria which opened in 1964. == See also == A rare Bills trough in Tunbridge Wells, one of only four identified in England.

C&C; is a video game franchise, mostly of the real-time strategy style, developed primarily by Westwood Studios and Electronic Arts. Much of the music for the series was composed and produced by Westwood Studios' former sound director and video game music composer Frank Klepacki for the early games, with composition duties being taken on by several others following the liquidation of Westwood Studios in 2003. Klepacki returned to the series in 2008 however to assist with the soundtrack for Red Alert 3. ==AlbumsCommand & Conquer=== The Music of Command & Conquer is a soundtrack album containing musical tracks from the video game Command & Conquer, composed by Frank Klepacki and produced by Westwood. It was originally released in 1995. The soundtrack spans two discs and 22 tracks with combined duration of approximately 72 minutes. The soundtrack was bundled with some of the game's collector's editions, which feature tracks from both the original Command & Conquer and the expansion. Though it was never released through retail, Westwood Studios sold this official soundtrack by special order through its website and in game catalogues. The album was packaged with a brushed aluminium design and featuring the official Command & Conquer logo. Many songs included in the release of the album include vocals which could previously only be heard on the PlayStation or Sega Saturn versions of the game; these were actually the original versions of the songs. The voice samples in the songs conflicted with the voices in the game, factoring in their removal from the in-game soundtrack. Some song names differ from the in- game versions. In these cases, the in-game track title is mentioned behind the original title. Also, some track titles differ from the versions on Frank Klepacki's website. In these cases, the website's track titles are mentioned behind the original in-game track title. The first seven in-game tracks are only available with the Covert Operations expansion pack. The Command & Conquer soundtrack is the first video game produced by Westwood to feature streaming music as opposed to MIDI. The 22k mono tracks were produced using an ASR-10 sampler, a Roland S760 sampler and a Roland JD-990 synth module. Klepacki has credited influences from dozens of artists including Peter Gabriel, Pink Floyd and Nine Inch Nails in the production of the soundtrack. Klepacki wrote the songs in batches, each in different musical genres. \\"In The Line of Fire\\" was written in an orchestral style while \\"C&C; Thang\\" was influenced by Hip Hop and metal in \\"Deception\\". Certain songs such as Hold On, in the style of Laurie Anderson, were cut from the game because they did not fit the style Klepacki was aiming for in the overall soundtrack. With the release of the Covert Operations expansion pack Klepacki composed many of the ambient songs of which he was requested by Westwood for the game. The track \\"No Mercy\\" as well as \\"Deception\\" feature quotes of the character Chuck De Nomolos from the film Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey. \\"In Trouble\\" contains quotes of Maverick from Top Gun and the track \\"I Remember Now\\" from the Queensr√øche album Operation: Mindcrime. None of these are actual voice samples from the original sources; they were all re-recorded in their own audio studio. ===Command & Conquer: Red Alert=== The game's original score was composed by Frank Klepacki and was voted the best video game soundtrack of 1996 by PC Gamer and Gameslice magazines. Among his most famous songs from the series is the theme of Red Alert, titled \\"Hell March\\", which accents the style of the game with adrenalized riffs of electric guitar, the sounds of marching feet, and synthesizers to a sampled drill command. Originally intended to be the theme for the Brotherhood of Nod faction in the Covert Operations expansion to the 1995 Command & Conquer, the track eventually ended up enlisting itself as a staple in the Red Alert series instead. Following the success of \\"Hell March\\", Klepacki headed the composition of its two variations, each becoming the main theme for Red Alert 2 (\\"Hell March 2/HM2\\") and Red Alert 3 (\\"Hell March 3\\"), respectively. When playing the single-player campaign, a limited number of tracks are initially available, and more are unlocked as the player progresses through missions. When playing in a multiplayer or \\"skirmish\\" game, however, all tracks are available from the start. More tracks were included in the Red Alert expansion packs: Counterstrike, The Aftermath and Retaliation. The music tracks can be listened to on Frank Klepacki's website. An official soundtrack was released with unique album art designed by Westwood studios and, like the previous release, featured the official Command & Conquer series logo with the Red Alert series motif below. The album contained all fifteen songs plus a hidden bonus track. Half a minute after the end of track 15 plays an unnamed bonus track. Its melodramatic opening was used in the secret campaign, and the track itself is a tribute to Misirlou, using the rhythm of an earlier Command & Conquer music piece, \\"No Mercy\\". In the media player on Frank Klepacki's website, the track is titled \\"Surf No Mercy\\". ===Command & Conquer: Tiberian Sun=== The soundtrack of Command & Conquer: Tiberian Sun was released in 1999. In addition certain editions of Tiberian Sun came with the soundtrack bundled in, such as in the Platinum Edition and Firepower bundle pack, which also contained the original Tiberian Sun and its expansion pack, Firestorm. Reception of the soundtrack was mixed as the music departed from the industrial music style of the original Command & Conquer in favor of a slow, moody ambient music reflecting the game's apocalyptic setting in a world being ecologically ravaged by Tiberium. Klepacki had originally started writing the soundtrack in a similar style to the previous titles but, after a meeting with Westwood, it was decided that the soundtrack would be \\"very dark, moody and not upbeat at all.\\" To help him achieve the desired style Klepacki enlisted the help and \\"electronic style\\" of Jarrid Mendelson for the production of songs such as Dusk hour and Flurry before the two split to write the remainder of the songs in their respective studios. When the time came to score the music for the Firestorm expansion pack, Klepacki and the producer decided that the music should be more upbeat and a return to the original style of the music of Command & Conquer. Unlike previous album releases the cover for Tiberian Sun did not feature the classic Command & Conquer series logo but favoured a shadowed style mirroring the ambient musical tone of the album. ===Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2=== Red Alert 2 Original Soundtrack is a soundtrack album containing musical tracks from the video game Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2, composed by Frank Klepacki and produced by Westwood. It was originally released in 2001. The soundtrack spans 16 tracks and has a duration of approximately 63:00. The title track of the album is a rewritten version of the original Hell March from Command & Conquer: Red Alert. Klepacki defined Red Alert 2s style with heavy metal guitar and fast-paced beats. Klepacki scored the game with a Korg Tr-rack, Novation Nova Desktop, and Roland 5080. The return to high-energy songs was owed in part to fan criticism of Tiberian Sun. Klepacki maintained the energetic style in Red Alert 2's expansion pack Yuri's Revenge. ===Command & Conquer: Red Alert 3=== Composer Frank Klepacki returned to write three tracks for the game. When interviewed regarding the matter, Klepacki indicated a strong desire to contribute more, but admitted that due to the fact that he was no longer being employed by Electronic Arts and currently works for Petroglyph Games, that was contractually impossible. At the RA3 Community Summit in June 2008, Klepacki showed a video to the entire C&C; community in which he stated that he had been hired to work on Red Alert 3, and that he was composing Hell March 3, the most recent update of Red Alerts iconic theme. In November 2008, Crispy Gamer reported that James Hannigan and Timothy Michael Wynn wrote the bulk of the game's remaining 114 minutes of music, with Hannigan composing the \\"Soviet March\\" menu theme along with music for the Empire of the Rising Sun Faction, and Wynn the music of the Allies and the remaining Soviet tracks. Music4Games has also covered the game's music score. The band From First to Last composed several remix versions of Hell March and Hell March 2, also featured on the Red Alert 3 soundtrack shipped with the Premier Edition. The expansion pack, Uprising, scored mostly by James Hannigan and Timothy Michael Wynn, introduced a new track called Yuriko's Theme by Hannigan, featuring two singers: Miriam Stockley and Satomi Morimoto. This theme was later remixed by Menno de Jong into a trance version, and it was later played at many great Trance festivals. ===Frank Klepacki & The Tiberian Sons: Celebrating 25 Years of Command & Conquer=== Specific for the Remastered Collection is an album of 22 tracks from the included games, Renegade, Tiberian Sun, Red Alert 2, the expansion Yuri's Revenge, and Red Alert 3. Made by Klepacki along with the fan band The Tiberian Sons, based on their performance at MAGFest 2019. ==Reception and legacy== Before the release of Command & Conquer, the majority of video games used MIDI files and other similar formats for music as a way to save space. Westwood was one of the first major developers to include actual audio files in their games. Although these recordings were generally of low quality compared to modern mp3s, many credit Westwood for helping to popularize the concept. ==References== Category:Command & Conquer Command and Conquer ","title":"Music of the Command &amp; Conquer series"},{"id":"20194599","text":"Eupatorium formosanum is a plant species in the family Asteraceae.

The collection is written in Ancient Greek, and the language used indicates that it may have been written in the fourth century AD, according to William Berg, an American classics professor.

Because the celebration of a thousand years of Rome is mentioned in joke 62, the collection perhaps dates from after that event in 248 AD. Although it is the oldest existing collection of jokes, it is known that it was not the oldest collection, because Athenaeus wrote that Philip II of Macedon paid for a social club in Athens to write down its members' jokes, and at the beginning of the second century BC, Plautus twice has a character mentioning books of jokes. The collection contains 265 jokes categorised into subjects such as teachers and scholars, and eggheads and fools. ==Modern day== In 2008, British TV personality and comedian Jim Bowen tested the material on a modern audience.

It is native to China, Japan and Korea. ==Description== Eupatorium japonicum is a herbaceous perennial growing 50‚Äì200 cm tall from short rhizomes with many fibrous roots. The stems are upright and marked with purplish red, ending with simple or corymbose, (flat) inflorescence that branch near their ends. The leaves are oppositely arranged on the stems and have short but rather thick petioles that are 1‚Äì2 cm long. The leaves midway up the stems are elliptic, narrowly elliptic, ovate-elliptic, or lanceolate in shape and 6 to 20 long and 2 to 6.5 cm wide. The leaves are pinnately veined, with lateral veins 7-paired, the undersides of the leaves have prominent veining. The Leaves gradually tapper to a sharp point and the bases are broad or narrow, and the leaf margins are sometimes 3-partite. Before flowering, the basel foliage withers away. The upper leaves of the stems are the same shape but smaller than those below them. The foliage is scabrid, crisped-villous or puberulent with yellow glandular hairs. Leaf margins are coarsely or double-serrate. The flowers are collected together into capitula (heads) that are densely corymbose, the inflorescence are usually 3 to 6 cm wide and rarely form large compound corymbose inflorescence that can be up to 20 cm wide. The involucre are campanulate shaped and 5‚Äì6 mm wide, composed of five flowers. The lanceolate shaped phyllaries are imbricate, with 3-seriate edges, the outer phyllaries are very short, only 1‚Äì2 mm wide, and green or purple-tinged. The florets are white, red-purple, or pink, with corolla about 5 mm wide and the corolla is covered with yellow glands. The fruits are black-brown, 5-angled, hairless achenes, that are elliptic in shape and about 3.5 mm long, and are covered with yellow glands. The 5 mm long pappus are white. This species blooms and fruits from June to November. ==Taxonomy== King and Robinson, in a 1987 paper, considered E. japonicum to be part of a more broadly defined E. chinense.

He is the son of Abdoulaye Wade, who was President of Senegal from 2000 to 2012. Before joining the government, Karim Wade was President of the National Agency for the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (Agence Nationale de l'Organisation de la Conf√©rence Islamique, ANOCI) and served as an advisor to his father. He was widely seen as a possible successor to his father as president, and his father was widely believed to be grooming him for the position. ==Early life== Wade, the son of Abdoulaye Wade and his French wife Viviane Wade, was born in Paris on 1 September 1968. He attended primary school at the French-Senegalese School of Dakar (part of the les Maristes Cours Sainte Marie de Hann) and completed his secondary education at the School of Saint Martin of France, where he obtained his Baccalaureate degree. He then attended the University of Paris 1 Pantheon- Sorbonne where he obtained a bachelor's degree in Management Science followed by a master's degree in Financial Engineering. ==Career== Karim's father, Abdoulaye Wade, was elected as President of Senegal in the 2000 presidential election after decades in opposition. In 2002, Karim Wade was named Personal Advisor to the President of the Republic, in charge of implementing major restructuring projects, among which were the New International Airport of Diass, the restructuring of Chemical Industries of Senegal (Industries Chimiques du Senegal, ICS), and the creation of the special integrated economic zone of Dakar. In June 2004, Wade was named President of ANOCI, whose mission was to prepare and organize the 11th Islamic Summit. The ANOCI team worked to create a so-called modern transportation infrastructure, rebuilding the Corniche Ouest, and developing public works such as the Soumbedioune Tunnel and the Northern Corridor Highway exchanges. Critics complained that Wade exceeded his budget as President of ANOCI. On 26 August 2008, Wade met with French President Nicolas Sarkozy to discuss a project for the installation of a nuclear power station in Senegal. This would ease the problem of electrical power generation which had confronted the country for many years. ==2009 Dakar election and ministerial appointment== Karim Wade ran for office for the first time in the March 2009 local election in Dakar. Although Wade won a seat as a municipal councillor, the opposition won a majority of seats and thus gained control of Dakar's municipal government; the outcome was considered to be a political humiliation for Wade.\\"He's old but he's running\\", Africa Confidential, volume 51, number 15, 23 July 2010, pages 8-9. Souleymane Nd√©n√© Ndiaye was subsequently appointed Prime Minister, and met with Karim Wade on 1 May 2009; at that meeting he offered Wade a position in the government, which Wade accepted. Later the same day, Wade was appointed Minister of State for International Cooperation, Regional Development (Am√©nagement du territoire), Air Transport, and Infrastructure. Members of the opposition suggested that Wade and his father had originally planned to use local power in Dakar to position him for the presidential succession, but that the plan had been thwarted due to the opposition victory in Dakar. Consequently, according to the speculation, Wade would instead be positioned for the succession through control of a key ministry. In the press, Wade's ministry was described as the largest ever in Senegal since its independence, and Wade was compared to Ali Bongo, son of Gabonese President Omar Bongo, who was also thought to be positioned for the presidential succession through control of a key ministry. President Wade consistently dismissed claims that he was preparing his son for the succession, describing Karim as an ordinary citizen. The office building in which Karim Wade worked caught on fire on 1 October 2009 due to an electrical problem, and Wade was rescued from the building by French and Senegalese firefighters.\\"Wade's son rescued from blaze\\", Reuters, 1 October 2009. Retrieved 2 October 2009. In December 2009, when defending Senegal's construction of a massive \\"African Renaissance\\" statue from imam claims that it was \\"idolatrous\\", President Wade compared the statue to Christian statues of Jesus Christ. Although he used the comparison to counter the suggestion that the statue was idolatrous, some Christians angrily protested his remarks, and Wade sent Karim to deliver an apology to Theodore Adrien Sarr, the Archbishop of Dakar. In a government where decision- making was already heavily dominated by President Wade, Karim was given vast responsibilities that far exceeded those assigned to ordinary ministers, and some argued that his portfolio covered 46% of the state's budget. According to President Wade, Karim's vast responsibilities were justified by his exceptional competence. By 2010, with Karim playing a key role in government work, it seemed clear to many Senegalese that he was being prepared for the presidential succession, particularly in light of his father's advanced age (Abdoulaye Wade was 84 years old in 2010). The elder Wade's decision to create the office of Vice-President fueled rumors that he envisioned it as a mechanism through which to secure his son's succession, although he made no immediate move to appoint Karim (or anyone else) to the newly created post. Despite the speculation, in 2010 President Wade still seemed fit and energetic for a man of his age, and he expressed his intention to stand for another term in the 2012 presidential election. Karim himself was observed to be highly deferential towards his father. In the public, there was considerable objection to the notion of a father-son succession, and Karim seemed foreign to many Senegalese, raising the question of whether such a succession would be politically viable. President Wade expanded his \\"super-minister\\" son's already vast responsibilities even further by assigning him the energy portfolio, in addition to his others on 4 October 2010. \\"Super-Minister Wade\\", Africa Confidential, volume 51, number 21, 22 October 2010. Abdoulaye Wade ran for another term as President in the February--March 2012 presidential election; his candidacy was controversial, with the opposition arguing that he had already exhausted the two terms permitted under the constitution. Wade was ultimately defeated by opposition candidate Macky Sall. Karim Wade consequently lost his appointed government post in April 2012, when Sall was sworn in. ===Legal charges=== A year after leaving office, Karim Wade was charged with corruption and imprisoned at Rebeuss beginning on 17 April 2013. He was sentenced to six years imprisonment on 23 March 2015, two days after the Senegalese Democratic Party designated him as its candidate for the next presidential election. He was also fined 138 billion CFA francs (US$228 million). Wade appealed to the Supreme Court, but the court ruled against him on 20 August 2015. Opponents of Sall argued that Wade's imprisonment was politically motivated. He spent three years in jail before being pardoned by Sall and released from prison on 24 June 2016. He was, however, still required to pay his enormous fine.Diadie Ba, \\"Senegal ex-president's son jailed for corruption released: government\\", Reuters, 24 June 2016. ===Panama Papers=== When ICIJ partner journalists from Ouestaf.com examined the Panama Papers they discovered documentation of the existence of secret contracts and payments between DP World FZE (DP) and Mamadou Pouye, the bribery codefendant of Karim Wade. This information was not available at their trial; Ouestaf confirmed their financial ties to the corporation for the first time during the Panama Papers investigation. Wade was sentenced in 2015 to a 6-year prison term by the Cour de r√©pression de l‚Äôenrichissement illicite (Crei), a specialized anti-corruption court. Wade was accused of illegally amassing assets of more than $240 million, and his childhood friend Pouye was sentenced to five years for allegedly helping him. Both denied wrongdoing and the United Nations and Amnesty International said their rights had been violated at trial. Ouestaf's investigation did not address the legality of the trial. Ouestaf did conclude that they had succeeded in tracing a payment to Pouye's oversea shell company from a subsidiary of DP. *Pouye owned three offshore companies, Seabury Inc, Regory Invest and Latvae Inc. :*Through Seabury, a consulting contract worth ‚Ç¨7.2 million with DP World materialized. :*Regory Invest acted as a Seabury subcontractor, and was paid ‚Ç¨65,000 a month, according to the documents. :*A second contract for 2013-2015 to focus on DP's African holdings, and would have paid Wade and Pouye $3 million at signing; however the pair were arrested. Seabury was set up in 2008, a year after Senegal signed a contract with DP World for rights to the container terminal at the Autonomous Port of Dakar. According to Ouestaf the documents make it clear that while Crei investigators were interested in the funds in Pouye's Monaco account, they did not know that the money was coming from his own offshore company. ==Personal life== Wade was married to a French citizen, Karine Wade, and had three children with her.

He is said to have distinguished himself as commander of the garrison of an allied city besieged by barbarian pirates, and then made praetorian prefect by the emperor Valerian on the strength of this. As praetorian prefect appears to have done useful work in restoring Antioch, the capital of the Roman East, after the devastation which had been inflicted by Shapur, the King of the Persians, in his invasion of 252. However, he was overwhelmed by the circumstances with which he had to contend when Shapur invaded on a second occasion in 260 and seems to have shared in the defeat of Valerian at the Battle of Edessa and his subsequent captivity in Persia. ==Sources== What little is known of Successianius comes from the Historia Nova of Zosimus and the information is teased out by Professor Andreas Alf√∂ldi and by Laurence Lee Howe.See This article is based on their accounts. ==Origins== Nothing is known of Successianus's origins or his date of birth. The absence of any evidence as to his nomen means that onomastic analysis cannot be applied. ==Career== Successianus is first encountered, probably in 254, as the commander of the garrison of Pityus, a city in the Kingdom of Colchis on the eastern coast of the Black Sea in modern Georgia. This region did not lie within the Roman imperial frontier, but it is known that Rome was in a treaty relationship with Colchis and supplied garrisons at key points. During Successianus's watch, Pityus came under attack by the Borani,The name may mean 'Northmen'. one of the peoples who lived in the steppes north of the Crimea known generally as the Scythae. Scythae is the anachronistic, classicising designation given by the Greek historian Dexippus to the peoples of the region now comprehended by the Ukraine and southern Russia in the third century AD and refers to the nations later known as the Borani, Goths, Heruls, Rhoxolani, Alans and many more. See Potter, Prof. D.S. The Roman Empire at Bay, AD 180-395 (2004) Routledge, London and New York (245-6) The Borani raid on Pityus was one of the first of the seaborne expeditions by the Scythae which were to reach their peak in the 260s. Thanks to Successianus's inspired leadership, the city held out and the raiders were forced to retreat after suffering considerable losses. This success by one of his commanders inspired the Emperor Valerian who had recently arrived in Syria Coele to take charge of the war against the Persians to call Successianus to his headquarters in Antioch, where he is said to have assisted the Emperor in rebuilding the city which had been reduced to ruins by King Shapur in 252.See Zozimus, op.cit., i.32. He is then supposed to have been made Praetorian Prefect although Zozimus nowhere says this. If he was thus promoted, his authority is likely to have been exercised in the Asian and oriental provinces which were ruled by Valerian as the senior emperor. (The European, African and Egyptian provinces were ruled by Valerian's son Gallienus who may have had Silvanus as his praetorian prefect. ==End== Unfortunately, the qualities that had made Successianus an excellent garrison commander in Pityus were obviously not those he needed as Valerian's Chief-of- General Staff: the Roman defence of the East, torn between the need to fend off Shapur in Mesopotamia and Syria and the Scythae in Asia Minor, was generally ineffective. Unable to battle the deadly combination of military defeat and plague military morale seems to have collapsed. It is supposed that Successianus was with Valerian, still serving him as Praetorian Prefect when Shapur defeated him and took him captive near the city of Osrhoene Edessa in June(?) 260.In the Res Gestae Divi Sarporis the King of Persia claimed to have captured a praetorian prefect after the battle at Edessa together with the Roman Emperor (RGDS 9-11). It is supposed that, like his Emperor, he died in Persian captivity. It is impossible to determine whether in Successianus we see a promising officer who had shown sufficient promise to be promoted praepositus of the garrison of an allied city, but was then elevated beyond his capabilities, or a soldier of some competence who was unable to get a grip on the situation that prevailed at the headquarters of the Imperial field- army. Some combination of these possibilities is more than likely.. ==References and notes== Category:Ancient Roman generals Category:3rd-century Romans Category:Praetorian prefects Category:Equestrian commanders of vexillationes Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Year of death unknown ","title":"Successianus"},{"id":"20194672","text":"Grant Hansen is an Australian Indigenous musician and broadcaster who has worked as a host of the Marngrook footy show, broadcast on National Indigenous TV network as well as Channel 31, Foxtel, ABC and SBS .

Originally broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on October 11, 2009, it sees the men of Springfield taking immense interest in a new combat sport called mixed martial arts (MMA). Marge is appalled by the violent sport and demands that the creator put a stop to it, but he agrees only if she will fight him in a match and win. \\"The Great Wife Hope\\" was written by Carolyn Omine and directed by Matthew Faughnan. Former Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) champion Chuck Liddell guest starred in it as himself. The episode featured multiple cultural references to fighting moves and positions, along with a single reference to professional wrestling promotion owner Vince McMahon. Since airing, the episode has received generally positive reviews from television critics, particularly towards the final scene. It received a 4.3/7 Nielsen rating with adults ages 18‚Äì49, behind all other programs aimed at that demographic in its timeslot. ==Plot== The men of Springfield become obsessed with a violent new string of mixed martial arts (MMA) competitions called \\"Ultimate Punch Kick and Choke Championships\\" (UPKCC). The kids soon begin to fight in small MMA matches of their own at the playground of Springfield Elementary School. While Bart and Nelson are fighting in one match, Marge sees them and is disgusted by the violent nature of the entire sport. She and a group of concerned women begin protesting the sport in front of the MMA stadium. Marge decides to go on stage before a match begins and demands that everyone cease the sport entirely. Chett Englebrit (patterned after actual fight promoter Roy Englebrecht), creator of the sport, agrees with Marge but only if she can fight him and win. Marge begins to train for the event, practicing rhythmic gymnastics. However, the family believes that her methods are unsuitable for the extreme task at hand and get her professional help. She learns boxing from Dredrick Tatum, wrestling from former Yale wrestler Mr. Burns, jujitsu and Judo from Akira, and bullying from Jimbo, Dolph and Kearney. Now fully trained, she enters the ring (after the announcer introduces her as one of his \\"Moms I'd Like to Fight\\") with Englebrit and is immediately knocked to the ground. Bart runs into the ring to defend his mother, but is thoroughly thrashed by Englebrit. Marge witnesses this and effectively beats Englebrit, winning their bet. Marge pulls down the ring's microphone and begins to give a speech, having had a change of heart about the demise of the violent sport upon having discovered her own dark side. She realizes, however, that everyone has already left the building to watch a drunken brawl in the parking lot. As Marge and Homer leave to have some MMA-inspired sex, Bart and Lisa enter the empty ring and decide to settle their lifelong sibling feud then and there. As they approach each other to throw a punch, the credits begin, but the scene quickly returns to depict Lisa easily punching Bart to the ground. ==Production and cultural references== Carolyn Omine wrote the episode. \\"The Great Wife Hope\\" was written by Carolyn Omine and directed by Matthew Faughnan. The writers of The Simpsons had a vast amount of knowledge and appreciation for mixed martial arts and included multiple references and themes of the sport throughout the episode. Former Ultimate Fighter champion Chuck Liddell guest starred as himself, signing photographs for fans, including Bart, at a cost of $25. Liddell commented that being a guest star was \\"very cool\\" and that the recording sessions were \\"easy\\". The episode is a satire of the combat sport of mixed martial arts. Throughout the episode, characters perform multiple fighting moves and positions. For example, Bart puts Nelson in a triangle choke at the playground when the two are fighting, while Marge takes out Englebrit with a flying armbar. Marge explains in the beginning of the episode that she found out about a creative new sport called \\"Crazy Bowling\\" by typing in \\"girls having fun\\"‚Äîafter ignoring several thousand pages of porn‚Äîinto the search engine Google. Also, H.R. Pufnstuf is parodied as HufnStuf on Ice, because Englebrit's assistant claims the next day, Hufnstuf on Ice will need the space. Marge claims that the word Ultimate makes everything worse, though Otto Mann protests that it does not affect the popular sport Ultimate Frisbee. Englebrit carries similar traits to the professional wrestling promoter Vince McMahon. Marge initially tries to train for the match by performing rhythmic gymnastics. She practices boxing with a character named Dredrick Tatum, who is a parody of renowned boxer Mike Tyson. ==Reception== Dana White openly criticized the episode for its portrayal of MMA. \\"The Great Wife Hope\\" originally aired in the United States on October 11, 2009 on the Fox network. In this initial broadcast, it received a Nielsen rating of 4.3/7, totaling 7.5 million viewers in the 18-19 demographic. The episode received generally positive reviews from television critics. IGN reporter Robert Canning gave the episode a 7.7/10 rating (\\"Good\\"), commenting that \\"what really made me enjoy 'The Great Wife Hope' were the peripheral bits, characters and jokes outside the main storyline. There were many, and they were funny. Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club, giving the episode a \\"B\\", wrote that it had \\"some amusing detours along the way\\". She compared \\"The Great Wife Hope\\" positively to season two's \\"Itchy & Scratchy & Marge\\", writing that Marge's attempts to bring down the MMA sport is the parallel to her trying to bring The Itchy & Scratchy Show off the air due to its severe cartoon violence in the latter episode. The staff of the website MMAjunkie said the episode was a sign that MMA had \\"truly made it\\" and fans of the sport could appreciate the writer's knowledge on the topic. Among more negative reviews include Jason Hughes of TV Squad, who commented that several jokes in the episode did not work, such as the reveal that Krusty the Clown has been sleeping with Sideshow Mel's wife for several years, though he did enjoy most of the other jokes and applauded the development of Nelson's character. Dana White, president of Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), told reporters that he did not like the episode. He added, \\"People like the [mixed martial arts] media always try to tell me that we're mainstream. [...] Did you see that Simpsons episode? Chuck Liddell signs an autograph for somebody, and he says, 'That will be $45, please'. The sport isn't like that at all. Then the promoter of the show fights Marge Simpson in the octagon, sucker-punches her in the face, and then says, 'You're the only woman I've ever hit that I didn't love'. That's the way mainstream looks at us and thinks of us, and I know that.\\" The final scene in the episode, featuring Bart and Lisa fighting in the arena, has received overwhelmingly positive remarks from reviewers. Canning wrote that it was \\"a classic moment for the series [...] This almost felt like a moment that could have closed out the series.\\" Hughes commented that it was \\"the best moment of the night\\" as it \\"would have been a typical ending\\" if it had not added the twist preceding the credits. Melissa and Randall Baker of TV Guide magazine said that the scene was a moment of \\"girl power\\", as Lisa knocks out Bart easily with one punch. ==ReferencesCategory:The Simpsons (season 21) episodes Category:2009 American television episodes Category:Television programs directed by Matthew Faughnan Category:Television episodes written by Carolyn Omine ","title":"The Great Wife Hope"},{"id":"20194715","text":"Eupatorium toppingianum is a plant species in the family Asteraceae.

They were invented by Ronald Jensen for his proof that cardinal transfer theorems hold under the axiom of constructibility. A far less complex but equivalent variant known as a simplified morass was introduced by Velleman, and the term morass is now often used to mean these simpler structures. == Overview == Whilst it is possible to define so-called gap-n morasses for n > 1, they are so complex that focus is usually restricted to the gap-1 case, except for specific applications. The \\"gap\\" is essentially the cardinal difference between the size of the \\"small approximations\\" used and the size of the ultimate structure. A (gap-1) morass on an uncountable regular cardinal Œ∫ (also called a (Œ∫,1)-morass) consists of a tree of height Œ∫ + 1, with the top level having Œ∫+-many nodes. The nodes are taken to be ordinals, and functions between these ordinals are associated to the edges in the tree order. It is required that the ordinal structure of the top level nodes be \\"built up\\" as the direct limit of the ordinals in the branch to that node by the maps œÄ, so the lower level nodes can be thought of as approximations to the (larger) top level node. A long list of further axioms is imposed to have this happen in a particularly \\"nice\\" way.K. Devlin. Constructibility. Springer, Berlin, 1984. == Variants and equivalents == Velleman and Shelah and StanleyS. Shelah and L. Stanley. S-forcing, I: A \\"black box\\" theorem for morasses, with applications: Super-Souslin trees and generalizing Martin's axiom, Israel Journal of Mathematics, 43 (1982), pp 185-224. independently developed forcing axioms equivalent to the existence of morasses, to facilitate their use by non-experts. Going further, Velleman showed that the existence of morasses is equivalent to simplified morasses, which are vastly simpler structures. However, the only known construction of a simplified morass in G√∂del's constructible universe is by means of morasses, so the original notion retains interest. Other variants on morasses, generally with added structure, have also appeared over the years. These include universal morasses,K. Devlin. Aspects of Constructibility, Lecture Notes in Mathematics 354, Springer, Berlin, 1973. whereby every subset of Œ∫ is built up through the branches of the morass, mangroves, which are morasses stratified into levels (mangals) at which every branch must have a node, and quagmires. ==Simplified morass== Velleman D. Velleman. Simplified Morasses, Journal of Symbolic Logic 49, No. 1 (1984), pp 257-271. defined gap-1 simplified morasses which are much simpler than gap-1 morasses, and showed that the existence of gap-1 morasses is equivalent to the existence of gap-1 simplified morasses. Roughly speaking: a (Œ∫,1)-simplified morass M = < œÜ‚Üí, F‚áí > contains a sequence œÜ‚Üí = < œÜŒ≤ : Œ≤ ‚â§ Œ∫ > of ordinals such that œÜŒ≤ < Œ∫ for Œ≤ < Œ∫ and œÜŒ∫ = Œ∫+, and a double sequence F‚áí = < FŒ±,Œ≤ : Œ± < Œ≤ ‚â§ Œ∫ > where FŒ±,Œ≤ are collections of monotone mappings from œÜŒ± to œÜŒ≤ for Œ± < Œ≤ ‚â§ Œ∫ with specific (easy but important) conditions. Velleman's clear definition can be found in,D. Velleman. Simplified Morasses, Journal of Symbolic Logic 49, No. 1 (1984), pp 257-271. where he also constructed (œâ0,1) simplified morasses in ZFC. In D. Velleman. Simplified Gap-2 Morasses, Annals of Pure and Applied Logic 34, (1987), pp 171‚Äì208. he gave similar simple definitions for gap-2 simplified morasses, and in D. Velleman. Gap-2 Morasses of Height œâ0, Journal of Symbolic Logic 52, (1987), pp 928‚Äì938. he constructed (œâ0,2) simplified morasses in ZFC.

He made his debut at the age of 18 and scored after just two minutes during a 3‚Äì0 win over Shrewsbury Town and scored again in his second game, a 2‚Äì1 defeat to Swansea Town. Despite Doncaster struggling in Division Four for several years, Kitchen made a name for himself at Rovers, forming striking partnerships with Brendan O'Callaghan and Mike Elwiss. He played alongside Elwiss in one of the biggest games for the club at the time when they drew 2‚Äì2 with Liverpool at Anfield on 5 January 1974, with Kitchen scoring one of the goals, before losing 2‚Äì0 in the replay. Kitchen went on to attract attention from higher divisions for several years, including spending time on trial at Bobby Robson's Ipswich Town, before signing for Leyton Orient in the summer of 1977 for ¬£40,000.\\"Peter Kitchen\\" football-england.com Retrieved on 13 November 2008 Ever present in his first year at Orient he finished as the club's top scorer with 21 goals, as well as scoring seven times in the FA Cup as the club reached the semi-finals beating Chelsea and Middlesbrough along the way. The following year he moved across London to join Fulham for a fee of ¬£150,000. The move did not work out for him as he struggled to find form and a series of injuries in his second year at Fulham saw him miss most of the season as the club were relegated and he moved to Cardiff City for ¬£100,000.

For most of his life he has lived in south Devon. His father was the writer and playwright Allen Saddler (1923‚Äì2011). After studying with Alfred Nieman at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, and being active in experimental music, he moved to Devon and quickly became involved in the performance and collection of folk music, accumulating some 600 hours of recordings from traditional performers. In the late 1980s his interest returned to avant-garde and experimental music, and he has composed and performed extensively in that genre. He taught at Dartington College of Arts and also at the University of Plymouth until 2018. His writings include the books \\"Soundings - All Kinds of Music, A 21st Century Musician's Anthology\\", \\"Dartington College of Arts - Learning by Doing\\", The Engaged Musician, John Cage as... and Sonic Harvest: Towards Musical Democracy; BBC Radios 2 and 3 documentaries including one on the composer Morton Feldman; and articles for Oral History, the Folk Music Journal, fRoots, Contemporary Music Review, Proof, The Wire and the New Statesman. ==Early studies and folk music== Richards cites formative influences as Alfred Nieman and Cornelius Cardew. He studied with Nieman at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. He also took part in experimental music events organised by Cornelius Cardew. In 1968 he moved from the Guildhall to Dartington College of Arts in Devon. He had already studied composition at Dartington Summer School of Music with French avant gardist Michel Decoust. In the 1970s he was a member of the folk trio Staverton Bridge with Tish Stubbs and Paul Wilson, and later toured the English folk scene as a duo with Tish Stubbs. He devoted much time to folklore research mainly in England's Westcountry, concentrating on gypsies, farming communities and children's songs and tales,For details of a recording session with farmers in Chagford, see: writing several papers on these subjects.See for instance: Sound recordings made by him are held by the British Library Sound Archive, and the Sam Richards Folklore Archive of 600 hours of recordings of song, music and interviews made between 1972‚Äì1987 is held by the British Library and the University of Plymouth. In 1979 he and Tish Stubbs published The English Folksinger, a collection of folk songs with melodies; it includes a few songs which Richards wrote himself.For instance, \\"Evening Love Song\\", p. 106; \\"King Kong\\", p. 218. At this time he was director of the Westcountry Folklore Centre and co-director of People's Stage Tapes, which concentrated on releasing recordings of traditional and revival performers, including a recording of Walter Pardon singing at a folk club in Torquay.See: From 1982 to at least 1989 he jointly produced with Steve Roud a quarterly newsletter titled \\"Folk Song Research: A Newsletter for Researchers of Traditional Song\\". ==Avant garde and jazz== After some years specialising in musical anthropology and fieldwork, Richards wrote \\"Fool's Holiday\\", a quasi-minimalist score with much opportunity for jazz improvisation. In collaboration with Peter Kiddle of \\"Theatre of Public Works\\" this became a theatre/dance piece with references to ritual and folklore. It was performed in England and also in the BritEsch Festival in Luxembourg. His recent premi√®res include \\"Kropotkin\\", a large scale piece for many performers, which was performed on 1 March 2009 as part of the Peninsula Arts Contemporary Music Festival, and \\"Four Sea Studies\\" ‚Äì premi√®red by the Torbay Symphony Orchestra in 2010. His \\"Four Drones\\" was commissioned in 2009 by the Experimental Flute Ensemble and played in various venues around South Devon. Premi√®red in June 2009, was his \\"About Time: Voices\\" at the San Francisco Public Library, performed by the Cornelius Cardew Choir. In 2012 \\"Vox Populi\\" was performed for the Totnes Festival and on Soundart Radio. In 2014 a new composition for string players and the marble run at the Bovey Tracey House or Marbles was premiered. ===Fish Music=== \\"Fish Music\\" was an idea conceived when Richards was a student. Fish swimming in a tank become musical notation by means of a five line musical stave being placed across the glass. String players are instructed to choose a fish and follow its course behind the stave. A revised version in which a team of improvisers with backs turned to the fish respond to the string sound, was premi√®red by the strings of Ten Tors Orchestra at the National Marine Aquarium, Plymouth in 2008. (Subscription required) The earlier version had no improvisers, but had a pre-recorded soundtrack instead. This was the version filmed by Long Room Productions for their hour-long documentary about Richards entitled \\"Sonic Harvest\\". An updated version for filmed fish, string players and improvising soloists was presented in Plymouth city centre in the summer of 2013, using the city's large outdoor screen for the film of the fish. The filmed fish film was also used in 2015 for the CAM Festival at the Millennium Centre, Cardiff, with five string players and improvisers Lona Kozik, Gorwel Owen and Richards himself. ==Dismissal from Dartington== From 2006, Richards was an outspoken opponent of the proposed closure and move to Falmouth of Dartington College of Arts, the last small independent arts college in the UK, where he had taught part-time for 30 years. He was a founder member of the \\"Save Dartington College Campaign\\" which existed not only to save the college, but to question the processes and interests which led to its closure. Richards said that \\"the whole ethos of Dartington can't and won't be transplanted down there. Once you have taken it away from the place where it grew from, it will become something else.\\" (Subscription required) He was suspended from the college over a satirical article he published on the campaign website that criticised the college administration and, in particular, principal Andrew Brewerton. Following a hearing, he was dismissed for gross insubordination, a decision that he appealed against, maintaining that it was unfair and biased against him. The appeal tribunal agreed that if Richards apologised to Brewerton he could be reinstated, giving guidelines as to what the apology should contain. However, the apology he wrote was not accepted by Brewerton and Richards refused to compromise further. ==Current activities== Richards worked part-time at the University of Plymouth from the early 1990s to 2018. He now lectures for the Academy Sound and Music in Exeter. In 2012 he became a member of the Board of Soundart Radio, a community FM radio station for in South Devon. In November 2012 he became Chair of Soundart's Board. He is also an improviser and jazz pianist, and played with the improving group Half Moon Assemblage with Lona Kozik, Elie Fruchter and, occasionally, Tim Sayer. He also does regular monthly gigs with the Jazzlab, an experimental band that plays free jazz, electronic/instrumental freeform pieces, and sometimes Richards' own poetry - which has a political edge. As a poet and reader he occasionally participates in local readings and has guested and headlined for many groups. From 2017-19 He was composer and radio programme maker for Sounding Coastal Change, an Open University project funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council, and focussing on the North Norfolk Coast. ==Publications== *The English Folksinger (with Tish Stubbs).

Havens, 1983 is a 1968 double album set by folk rock musician Richie Havens featuring a combination of studio recordings and live material recorded in concert during July 1968. The album combined original material with several of the covers for which Havens is known. Notable songs include the singles \\"Stop Pushing and Pulling Me\\" and \\"Indian Rope Man\\", the latter of which has been multiply covered under its own name and in retooled identity as \\"African Herbsman.\\" The genre-bending album was critically and commercially well-received, reaching #80 on the Billboard \\"Pop Albums\\" chart. Initially released on the Verve label, it has been reissued multiple times in various formats, including by Verve subsidiary Verver Forecast/PolyGram and Australian label Raven Records. It has also been compiled with albums Mixed Bag and Something Else Again in multi-cd set Flyin' Bird: The Verve Forecast Years on the Hip-O Select/Universal label. ==Background== Richard P. Havens, 1983 compiles a number of studio tracks with live material recorded for a concert in July 1968. Musically, it displays Havens' multi-instrumental approach and demonstrates the influence of several genres, including folk rock, world music and folk blues. As critic Richie Unterberger described it in 2003's Eight Miles High, the album \\"worked towards a folk-rock-world-music fusion of sorts, though one grounded in the sort of bluesy folk [Havens]...and others had pioneered in the Village back in the early 60s.\\" Producer Elliott Mazer said that Havens' method of playing presented some difficulties to the many musicians who joined him, as \\"Richie was not very interested in learning the chords for the songs\\" but \\"made up his own\\". Described as a concept album, this was Havens' first experience co-producing one of his albums. Additional production on the album was provided by Mazer and Mark Roth, while John Court lent production to the song \\"Indian Rope Man.\\" For the cover, Roth photographed Havens in infrared. ==Music and reception== The album was commercially successful, reaching #80 on the Billboard \\"Pop Albums\\" chart, and critically well received. 2004's Rip It Up: The Black Experience in Rock'n'Roll indicates that this album, along with Havens' Mixed Bag and Alarm Clock, \\"should be considered staples of the rock canon.\\" The Rough Guide to Rock praises it as \\"an excellent mix of originals and covers, with a darker, brooding feel.\\" In a more modest assessment, Unterberger's review in Allmusic summarizes, \\"As with many double albums, it perhaps could have used some pruning, although in general it was a worthy expansion of his sound as captured on record.\\" The album includes several of the covers for which Havens is known, particularly the \\"imaginative covers\\" of Beatles and Bob Dylan which Unterberger indicated \\"he was able to recast as his own\\". However, while Rough Guide suggested that the album bears \\"witness to Havens' compelling ability as a live performer\\", Unterberger discerned on this particular recording \\"an over reliance on Beatles covers\\" and felt \\"the live stuff on side four...seems like an afterthought to push the set to double-LP length.\\" Singles released from the album include \\"Stop Pulling and Pushing Me\\", the B side of a cover of \\"Rocky Raccoon\\", in July 1969, and \\"Indian Rope Man\\", which was released twice in May 1969: as an \\"A\\" side with \\"Just Above My Hobby Horses Head\\" and a \\"B\\" side with Beatles' cover \\"Lady Madonna.\\" \\"Indian Rope Man\\" has proved enduring, with multiple covers by Brian Auger, Julie Driscoll and Phaze, among others. It was also retooled and retitled as \\"African Herbsman\\", under which title it was performed by Bob Marley. ==Track listing== Except where otherwise noted, all tracks composed by Richie Havens. ===Side One=== #\\"Stop Pulling and Pushing Me\\" ‚Äì 1:48 #\\"For Haven's Sake\\" ‚Äì 7:01 #\\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" (John Lennon, Paul McCartney) ‚Äì 3:37 #\\"What More Can I Say John?\\" ‚Äì 4:38 ===Side Two=== #\\"I Pity the Poor Immigrant\\" (Bob Dylan) ‚Äì 3:09 #\\"Lady Madonna\\" (John Lennon, Paul McCartney) ‚Äì 1:57 #\\"Priests\\" (Leonard Cohen) ‚Äì 5:15 #\\"Indian Rope Man\\" (Havens, Joe Price, Mark Roth) ‚Äì 3:02 #\\"Cautiously\\" (Maurey Haydn) ‚Äì 4:00 ===Side Three=== #\\"Just Above My Hobby Horse's Head\\" (Havens, Mark Roth) ‚Äì 2:58 #\\"She's Leaving Home\\" (John Lennon, Paul McCartney) ‚Äì 4:05 #\\"Putting out the Vibration, and Hoping It Comes Home\\" (Havens, Mark Roth) ‚Äì 2:53 #\\"The Parable of Ramon\\" (live) (Havens, Mark Roth) ‚Äì 7:56 ===Side Four=== #\\"With a Little Help from My Friends\\" (live) (John Lennon, Paul McCartney) ‚Äì 5:19 #\\"Wear Your Love Like Heaven\\" (live) (Donovan Leitch) ‚Äì 4:55 #\\"Run, Shaker Life\\"/\\"Do You Feel Good?\\" (live) (arranged & adapted by Havens/Havens) ‚Äì 4:04/4:52 ===Bonus CD Tracks (not appearing on the original double album)=== #\\"Handsome Johnny\\" (Lou Gossett, Jr., Havens) ‚Äì 3:54 #\\"No Opportunity Necessary, No Experience Needed\\" ‚Äì 2:58 ==PersonnelPerformance=== *Warren Bernhardt ‚Äì keyboards, clavinet *Brad Campbell ‚Äì bass *Bob Chase ‚Äì percussion *Diane Comins ‚Äì harmonica, harp *Jim Fairs ‚Äì bass *Richie Havens ‚Äì acoustic guitar, electric guitar, sitar, vocals, tamboura, handclapping, ondioline *Charles Howall ‚Äì vocals *Carol Hunter ‚Äì bass *Teddy Irwin ‚Äì guitar *Bruce Langhorne ‚Äì guitar *Ken Lauber ‚Äì keyboards *Donald McDonald ‚Äì drums *Arnie Moore ‚Äì bass *Weldon Myrick ‚Äì steel guitar *John Ord ‚Äì organ, piano, celeste, keyboards *Skip Prokop ‚Äì drums *Charlie Smalls ‚Äì keyboard, piano *Jeremy Steig ‚Äì flute *Stephen Stills ‚Äì bass *Collin Walcott ‚Äì sitar, tabla *Paul \\"Dino\\" Williams ‚Äì guitar *Daniel Ben Zebulon ‚Äì drums ===Production=== *Warren Barnett ‚Äì mastering *Bill Blachly ‚Äì engineer *Carter Collins ‚Äì conductor *John Court ‚Äì producer *Richie Havens ‚Äì arranger, producer *Wally Heider ‚Äì engineer *Al Manger ‚Äì engineer *Elliot Mazer ‚Äì producer *Ian McFarlane ‚Äì release preparation *Kevin Mueller ‚Äì release preparation *Terry Reilly ‚Äì liner notes *Mark Roth ‚Äì producer, photography, cover design *Peter Shillito ‚Äì concept, release preparation ==Chart position== {  - !align=\\"left\\"Chart !align=\\"left\\"Peak - align=\\"left\\"U.S. Billboard Pop Albums align=\\"center\\"80 } == Releases == The album was initially released on vinyl in 1968 on Verve Forecast Records.

The next season saw him similarly on the sidelines but he did manage an impressive 7 goals from just 13 games. Booth scored four goals against Arsenal on 10 November 1956, in a 5‚Äì2 victory for Wolves ‚Äì this is still a record against the Gunners, shared with Billy Walker of Aston Villa who also scored four in 1920.

Thomas played nine games and kicked five goals for Collingwood over two VFL seasons. He debuted at Collingwood in 1925, a year when Collingwood reached the Grand Final for the first of six successive seasons. As a result of the Magpies side being so strong, Bird struggled to make the team and after his two games in 1925 didn't make another appearance with the seniors until 1928. In a premiership year for Collingwood, Thomas played seven games, including one against Carlton at Princes Park where he kicked three goals in a thrilling win. He however missed out on selection again for the finals series. On the cricket field Bird was a right-handed wicket-keeper batsman and played three first-class matches for Victoria in the summer of 1928/29. His debut match, against New South Wales, was his finest as he scored 63 from position eight in the batting order to help Victoria secure a draw in their second innings.

He formulated the stereomorphism principle, according to which the cryptic effect of the colour pattern is a result of its 'flattening' (the three-dimensional objects look flat) or 'disjunctive' effect (the two-dimensional objects look like a complex three-dimensional relief). To prove his point he built the plaster three- dimensional models of the lepidopteran wings, the photographs of which looked like an actual colour pattern of stripes and shades (photos were published in a series of papers and in his textbook in entomology). Among his other important contributions are a textbook in entomology with a large morphology section heavily based on Snodgrass and Weber (1949, still in use in Russian Universities), and a book on practical apiculture (1945). His gravestone is ornamented with a reproduction of the groundplan of the colour-pattern of lepidopteran wings from his textbook. == Selected publications == * On the groundplan of the wing-pattern in nymphalids and certain other families of rhopalocerous Lepidoptera.

It was adopted on November 6, 1995, and was amended in 2007 which permitted dual citizenship. == Acquisition of Armenian citizenship == The citizenship of Armenia is acquired: * through recognition of citizenship; * by birth; * through acceptance into citizenship; * through the restoration of the citizenship; * through acceptance into citizenship by group; * by the basis provided by the international treaties of Armenia. It includes the right of return for members of the Armenian diaspora. === Birth === A child born in Armenia acquires the citizenship of Armenia if: * the parents hold Armenian citizenship at the moment of the child's birth regardless of the place of the birth; * one parent holds Armenian citizenship at the moment of the child's birth, whilst the other parent is unknown or stateless. If, at the moment of child's birth, one of the parents holds an Armenian citizenship and the other parent is a foreign citizen, the determination of the child's citizenship is based on a written consent of both parents. A child of stateless persons who was born in the territory of Armenia acquires citizenship of Armenia. === Recognition === The following persons are recognised as citizens of Armenia: * Citizens of the former Arm. SSR permanently residing on the territory of the Republic of Armenia, who until the enactment of the Constitution, have not acquired citizenship of another State or have rejected that citizenship; * Stateless persons or former citizens of other USSR republics who are not foreign citizens, permanently residing in the RA and before 31 December 2003, have applied for the acquisition of the RA citizenship (amended on 20 March 2002); * Former citizens of the Armenian SSR, who live outside the Republic of Armenia and have not acquired citizenship of another country (amended on 12 April 2001). === Naturalization === Any person who does not have an Armenian citizenship may be granted citizenship of Armenia if he/she: * is aged 18 or over; * has resided legally in Armenia for the last 3 years; * is proficient in the Armenian language; * is familiar with the Constitution of Armenia. A person who does not hold Armenian citizenship can be granted citizenship of Armenia without the condition of the term of residence, if he/she: * marries a citizen of Armenia or has a child, father or mother who are citizens of Armenia; or * has parents or at least one parent that had held citizenship of Armenia in the past or had been born on the territory of Armenia and had applied for the citizenship of Armenia within 3 years from becoming 18 years old; or * is Armenian by his origin and has resided in the territory of Armenia. The person accepting the citizenship of Armenia is to read the text of the oath in Armenian and sign it. ==Dual citizenship== Dual citizenship was authorised after the constitutional amendment of the Armenian Citizenship Law No. 75-N on February 26, 2007. === Military service === Armenia retains the conscription policy, and in most cases, dual citizens are not exempted from the service. Consulting a licensed attorney specializing in Armenian Military Laws may be necessary to determine ones eligibility to be conscripted, as laws and rules regarding conscription tend to change. The citizen of a foreign state who has accepted Armenian citizenship is exempt from compulsory military service if, before being admitted into the state record of Armenian citizenship, the citizen has served in the armed forces of the foreign state for no less than 12 months, or has completed alternative military service for no less than 18 months, except for the states defined by the Government of the Republic of Armenia. For Diaspora Armenians who wish to be exempt from military service, a Special Residency Status is also available in the Republic of Armenia. == Special Residency Status == Armenia allows foreign citizens to receive a 10-year Special Residency Status, granted to foreign citizens of Armenian ancestry and also to other distinguished individuals, who have provided significant services to the Armenian state and nation and/or are engaged in economic and cultural activities in Armenia. Those granted Special Residency Status are issued Special Armenian Passports and are no longer be required to obtain entry visas for traveling to Armenia. While in Armenia, they enjoy the full protection of the Armenian law, as well as the rights and obligations of Armenian citizens, except for the right to vote and to run for office, enroll in political organizations. They are exempt from military service in the Armed Forces of Armenia. The Special Passport, however, does not waive visa requirements for other CIS countries or to other countries that provide visa-free travel to bearers of an Armenian passport. Travelling to those countries requires the bearer of the Special Passport to use his or her national passport. The survivors of the Armenian Genocide are granted Special Passports through a facilitated procedure, and the application fee is waived. ==Visa requirements== Visa requirements for Armenian citizens In 2017, Armenian citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 58 countries and territories, ranking the Armenian passport 78th in terms of travel freedom (tied with Beninese, Kyrgyzstani and Moroccan passports) according to the Henley visa restrictions index. ==See also== *Armenian diaspora *Armenians in Syria *Armenians in Iraq *Armenians in Iran *Armenians in Turkey *Armenians in the Middle East ==References * Texts of the Armenian law on citizenship * http://arka.am/en/news/society/parliament_to_extend_amnesty_for_cash_scheme_for_military_dodgers/ Category:Nationality law Category:Armenian law ","title":"Armenian nationality law"},{"id":"20195069","text":"Princess Anna of Saxony and Joseph Francis of Austria Princess Anna Monika Pia of Saxony, Duchess of Saxony (Full German name: Prinzessin Anna Monika Pia von Sachsen, Herzogin zu Sachsen) (4 May 1903 - 8 February 1976) was the seventh and youngest child of Frederick Augustus III of Saxony and his wife Archduchess Luise of Austria, Princess of Tuscany and a younger sister of both Georg, Crown Prince of Saxony, and Friedrich Christian, Margrave of Meissen. ==Early life== While pregnant with Anna, her mother Luise left Saxony on 9 December 1902 without her children.

It is based on the Constitution of Moldova (articles 17, 18 and 19). It is mainly based on Jus sanguinis. Dual nationality is allowed, under certain conditions. Under the law, there are provisions for citizenship to be acquired by: * Birth * Recognition * Adoption * Recover * Naturalisation == Citizenship by birth == You acquire citizenship by birth, if you fulfil any of the following requirements. # Either of your parents is a citizen of Moldova at the time of your birth # You are born on the territory of Moldova, and your parents are stateless persons # You are born on the territory of Moldova, and cannot receive the citizenship of either of your parents # Any foundling found on the territory of Moldova is considered a citizen unless proven otherwise, until the age of 18 == Citizenship by naturalisation == Citizenship may be granted to anyone who has reached the age of 18, and who meets one of the following criteria: # Has resided in Moldova lawfully and habitually for the last ten years; has been married to a citizen of Moldova for at least three years; or has resided lawfully and habitually for three years with parents or children (including adoptive) who are citizens of Moldova # Has resided lawfully and habitually for five years before reaching the age of 18 # Is a stateless citizen or recognised refugee, who has been lawfully and habitually for at least 8 years In addition they must fulfil the following criteria: # Knows and observes the provisions of the Moldovan constitution # Knows the national language, sufficiently well to integrate into social life # Loses or renounces the citizenship of another state, if possessed, except in the cases when the loss of the renunciation is not possible or cannot reasonably be requested ==Dual citizenship== Moldova allows its citizens to hold foreign citizenship in addition to their Moldovan citizenship. Acquiring a foreign citizenship, therefore, does not result in the loss of Moldovan citizenship.

It had a population of 1612 at the 2013 Census. The suburb is located on a plateau of the Eastern Hutt Valley Hills, with most of the suburb being 115-135 metres above sea level. It can be accessed from SH2 by exiting at Norana Road. It is bordered by Maoribank at the lower, south-western end of Norana Road and Brown Owl by SH2 to the north. While there are no shops in Timberlea, residents have access to the Caltex service station and small shopping centre in neighbouring Brown Owl. The main shops in Upper Hutt's city centre are only 3.5-6.5 km away, depending on where in Timberlea you are travelling from. == Subdivisions == Timberlea is effectively split into three distinctive areas: The main part of Timberlea (between Mount Marua Drive and the border with Maoribank by Garth Lane) was developed mainly between the late 1960s and the early 1980s. The section of Timberlea between Mount Marua Drive and SH2 is a very modern and relatively upmarket subdivision, with most houses being built from 2007 to present. The section above Mount Marua Drive is known as Mount Marua (from Marua Palms Grove eastwards). This area, having been developed from 2010 onwards, is one of Upper Hutt's most upmarket and exclusive areas, containing many large homes on large sections, with nearly every house having an uninterrupted view of either the Upper Hutt Valley or the Mangaroa Valley (or both), due to being situated at the top of the Eastern Hutt Valley Hills. Mount Marua Way, situated at the highest point of the subdivision (between 210 and 240 metres above sea level), is a private gated community that has a communal tennis court and small pond. == Parks == Timberlea has three public parks: Speargrass Park; Located off of Speargrass Grove and Blueberry Grove, it contains a small playground. Gentian Reserve; Located off of Gentian Street, this forest-covered reserve contains a few walking trails on the slopes of the hill on its eastern side. Timberlea Park; Accessed from Norana Road, this central Timberlea park contains a small playground, community hall and large lawn next to the bush-covered valley hills. == Public Transport == Timberlea is serviced by the Te Marua commuter bus route (#112), operated by Metlink. ==References== Category:Suburbs of Upper Hutt ","title":"Timberlea, New Zealand"},{"id":"20195116","text":"Gideon Marc Conn (born 15 January 1980) is an English singer-songwriter from Manchester. He tours extensively around the UK, having played at many UK festivals including Glastonbury Festival. Also an accomplished painter, drawer and sculptor, Conn sells his artwork and accepts commissions through his website. == Early life == Conn began writing and playing music at the age of 15 when his friend taught him a handful of guitar chords; he began adding vocals to these chords and thus began his interest in composition. While completing his art degree in Manchester, he was known to play the piano in the main gallery of the university, as well as using the whole building as a studio for his sculptures. He graduated in 2003 and continues to paint, draw and sculpt alongside his pursuit of music. He has had many exhibitions in both Manchester and in London. Having worked as a labourer for a year following his attending of university he decided to pursue a career as an artist and musician. == Music career == Conn's songwriting combines fingerpicking acoustic playing with jazz-inspired chord progressions and hip-hop rhythms. His vocal delivery encompasses singing, rapping and scatting. His music varies between a synth-laden modern sound and a more lo-fi production. He takes inspiration from a wide range of influences, primarily in soul and jazz music, and has expressed admiration for artists such as Stevie Wonder, Badly Drawn Boy, OutKast, Nat King Cole and The Yeah Yeah Yeahs. In the early stages of his music career, Conn self-released albums, EPs and singles; this included his Connpilation series. His first official single \\"I Want You Around\\" came out on Mannequin Republic on 10\\" vinyl. His first album was New Bop Sounds in March 2010. He then recorded the football-themed single \\"Get Your Hopes Up (Win, Win, Win)\\" with Clint Boon, which was released just ahead of the 2010 World Cup, on 31 May 2010. The second album Take It All was released in 2012, with a video for its lead single \\"Fall Under Tokyo\\" being filmed in Tokyo. It featured the Manchester-based soul singer Josephine on the track \\"Colours\\". November 2013 saw the release of Highlights and Perceptions on 12-inch vinyl and digital download. The album is essentially two EPs; side A (Highlights) being made up of Donna Maciocia material, while side B (Perceptions) comprises five tracks from Conn. The cover art was designed by both artists. Conn released his third album Hip Hop Original on 27 November 2015. Two singles were released from this album; \\"I Just Don't Know You Very Well\\" on 9 October 2015 and \\"Crystallised\\" on 13 May 2016. Conn's fourth album, Being Gideon, was released on 24 October 2019. This had been preceded by the single \\"It's Your Turn\\" on 23 August 2019. Conn has been played on XFM Radio and on BBC Radio 1 by Huw Stephens, and was the subject of a documentary called Hitting Home: Good Luck Gideon, which was broadcast on Channel M. He was included on the 'A-Z Bestival' Compilation as the letter 'G'. With Scroobius Pip and Ed Sheeran as self-professed fans, he supported popular American singer- songwriter Jason Mraz on his 2008 UK tour. == Discography == *\\"I Want You Around\\" (Single, 2008) *\\"Londonderry\\" (Single, 2009) *New Bop Sounds (Album, 2010) *Take It All (Album, 2012) *Highlights & Perceptions (Split album with Donna Maciocia, 2013) *\\"Black Hole Sun\\" (Soundgarden cover) (Digital Download, 2015) *\\"I Just Don‚Äôt Know You Very Well\\" (Single, 2015) *\\"Deception\\" (Blackalicious cover) (Digital Download, 2015) *Hip Hop Original (Album, 2015) *\\"Crystallised\\" (Single, 2016) *\\"I Wish I Was A Volkswagon Beetle\\" (Digital Download, 2017) *\\"It's Your Turn\\" (Single, 2019) *Being Gideon (Album, 2019) == References  External links == * Official website * Gideon Conn YouTube channel * Gideon Conn merchandise and music store * Gideon Conn SoundCloud page * Gideon Conn BandCamp page and music store * BandCamp page for Gideon Conn's project with Donna Maciocia Category:English singer-songwriters Category:Living people Category:Musicians from Manchester Category:1980 births Category:21st-century English singers ","title":"Gideon Conn"},{"id":"20195118","text":"Kalimati Kalche is a village development committee in Salyan District in the Rapti Zone of western-central Nepal.

During World War I (1914‚Äì1918), Ireland was part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, which entered the war in August 1914 as one of the Entente Powers, along with France and Russia. In part as an effect of chain ganging, the UK decided due to geopolitical power issues to declare war on the Central Powers, consisting of Germany, Austria- Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, and Bulgaria. Occurring during Ireland's revolutionary period, the Irish people's experience of the war was complex and its memory of it divisive. At the outbreak of the war, most Irish people, regardless of political affiliation, supported the war in much the same way as their British counterparts, and both nationalist and unionist leaders initially backed the British war effort. Irishmen, both Catholic and Protestant, served extensively in the British forces, many in three specially raised divisions, while others served in the armies of the British dominions and the United States, John T. Prout being an example of an Irishman serving in the latter. Over 200,000 men from Ireland fought in the war, in several theatres. About 30,000 died serving in Irish regiments of the British forces,David Fitzpatrick, Militarism in Ireland, 1900‚Äì1922, in Tom Bartlet, Keith Jeffreys ed's, p. 397 and about 49,400 died altogether. In 1916, Irish republicans took the opportunity of the ongoing war to proclaim an independent Irish Republic and launch an armed rebellion against British rule in Dublin, which Germany attempted to help. In addition, Britain's intention to impose conscription in Ireland in 1918 provoked widespread resistance and as a result remained unimplemented. After the end of the Great War, Irish republicans won the Irish general election of 1918 and declared Irish independence. This led to the Irish War of Independence (1919‚Äì1922), fought between the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and British forces. Ex-servicemen fought for both sides. During the War of Independence, the British government partitioned Ireland. This phase of conflict ended with the Anglo-Irish Treaty which split Sinn F√©in and the IRA, leading to the Irish Civil War (1922‚Äì1923) between pro-treaty and anti-treaty forces. The pro-treaty forces were victorious, with most of the island becoming the Irish Free State. The remarks attributed to National Volunteer and poet, Francis Ledwidge, who was to die in preparation of the Third battle of Ypres in 1917, perhaps best exemplifies the changing Irish nationalist sentiment towards enlisting, the War, and to the Germans and British.Letter Ledwidge to Chase p698 After the leaders of the 1916 Easter Rising ‚Äì including his friend and literary mentor Thomas MacDonagh ‚Äì were executed during his military leave, he said: ==Prelude to the Great WarPolitical climate in Ireland=== The First World War was immediately preceded in Ireland by a major political crisis over Home Rule or Irish self- government. The Government of Ireland Act 1914 received the Royal Assent on 18 September 1914. However, the operation of this Act was suspended for the duration of the war. Moreover, it was resisted fiercely by Unionists, concentrated in Ulster. In 1913, they had formed an armed militia, the Ulster Volunteers, to resist the implementation of Home Rule or to exclude Ulster itself from the settlement. Nationalists in response formed a rival militia the Irish Volunteers, to \\"defend the constitutional rights of the Irish people\\",Horgan, John J.: Parnell to Pearse p. 256, Brown & Nolan Press Dublin (1946) and to put pressure on Britain to keep its promise of Home Rule.Collins, M.E., Sovereignty and partition, 1912‚Äì1949, p. 32, Edco Publishing (2004) Conflict between the two armed groups looked possible in the early months of 1914. The outbreak of war temporarily defused this crisis. ===Nationalist response=== On 3 August 1914, John Redmond, the leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party, declared in the House of Commons, \\"the government may withdraw every one of their troops from Ireland and rely that the coast of Ireland will be defended from foreign invasion by her armed sons\\". His 'Home Defence' initiative was widely acclaimed, though not by all of the Irish Volunteers.Hennessey, Thomas: Dividing Ireland, World War I and Partition, Ireland in 1914 pp. 46‚Äì47, Routledge Press (1998) After Unionist leader Edward Carson urged Ulster Volunteers on 3 September to enlist in their new Ulster division and with the Home Rule Bill passing into law on 17 September, Redmond found himself under pressure to demonstrate commitment.Hennessey, Thomas: pp. 72‚Äì73 On 20 September, addressing a muster of Volunteers in Woodenbridge, Co. Wicklow, he called upon them to enlist in existing Irish regiments of the British army, in support of the Allied war effort: Redmond's call came at a time of heightened emotions as the swift German advance through neutral Belgium was also threatening Paris. Redmond believed that Imperial Germany's hegemony and military expansion threatened the freedom of Europe and that it was Ireland's duty, having achieved future self-government through the passing of the Home Rule Bill. Many other parliamentary leaders, such as William O'Brien, Thomas O‚ÄôDonnell, and Joseph Devlin, supported Redmond's decision. Redmond's own son, William Redmond, enlisted, as did his brother Major Willie Redmond MP, despite being aged over 50 years. They were among a group of five Irish MPs who enlisted, the others being J. L. Esmonde, Stephen Gwynn and D. D. Sheehan, as well as former MP Tom Kettle.Department of the Taoiseach: Irish soldiers in the First World War, see also: * Initially the Catholic Church in Ireland was also supportive of the War, under the slogan of \\"save Catholic Belgium\\".Charles Townshend, Easter 1916, p. 78 The 180,000 Irish Volunteers were divided by Redmond's support for the British war effort. A large majority followed him, forming the National Volunteers. About 25,000 of these went on to serve in Irish regiments of the New British Army during the war. The remaining 10,000 Volunteers under Eoin MacNeill declared they would keep their organisation together and in Ireland until Home Rule was passed. A further 100,000 or more men, who were not members of the National Volunteers, enlisted from around Ireland in the New Army divisions for the duration of the war. However, the more radical fringe of Irish nationalism, the remaining Irish Volunteers and the secretive Irish Republican Brotherhood, rejected Irish participation in the war on Britain's side. They actively opposed enlistment and in secret, elements of them prepared an armed insurrection against British rule in Ireland which would later be known as the 1916 Easter Rising. Redmond gave a speech in opposition to the Easter Rising in which he described it as a 'German intrigue'. His pleas, and Dillon's, that the rebels be treated leniently were ignored by the Irish public, and would later cost his party in the election following the War, as well as being of consequence to subsequent events such as the British military actions under martial law following the Easter Rising and the Conscription Crisis of 1918. Sinn F√©in won the majority of seats (73 out of 105 seats) in the Irish general election of 1918 while the Irish Parliamentary Party and the Unionist Party won 6 and 22 seats respectively. ===Unionist response=== Unionist leader Edward Carson, promised immediate Unionist support for the war effort. He was motivated in this by two main factors, one being genuine identification with the British Empire, another being a desire to demonstrate the loyalty of Unionists to the British government, despite having formed an armed militia in defiance of it over Home Rule.McIntosh, Gillian: The force of Culture, Unionist Identities in 20th Century Ireland pp. 10‚Äì11 At this time, Herbert Kitchener was in the process of raising a New Service Army in support of the relatively small pre-war regular Army. The Unionists were granted their own Division, the 36th (Ulster) Division which had its own reserve militia officers and its own symbols. It was largely recruited from the Ulster Volunteer force and had a strongly Protestant and unionist identity.McIntosh: pp. 10‚Äì11 Redmond requested the War Office to allow the formation of a separate Irish Brigade as had been done for the Ulster Volunteers. The British Government, however, was suspicious of Redmond after he declared to the Volunteers that they would return as an armed and trained Irish Army by the end of 1915 to resist Ulster's opposition to Home Rule. Eventually he was granted the gesture of the 16th (Irish) Division. However, with the exception of its Irish General William Hickie and unlike the 36th (Ulster) Division, the 16th was led by English officers. Most Irish recruits lacked military training to act as officers.Bowman, Timothy, Irish Regiments in the Great War, Ch. 3: Raising the Service battalions, pp. 61‚Äì99, Manchester University Press (2003) According to David Lloyd George, Nationalist women had embroidered a green flag depicting the Celtic harp for the Irish division, and Unionist women had embroidered for the Ulster Division a flag emblazoned with the Red Hand of Ulster. Kitchener ordered the green flag with the harp to be taken away but he allowed the Ulster Division to keep their flag: \\"Ireland was deeply hurt. Her pride was cut to the quick, her sense of fair play was outraged, her sympathy with the Holy War against the military dictatorship of Europe was killed, and John Redmond's heart was broken\\".David Lloyd George, War Memoirs: Volume I (London: Odhams, 1938), p. 453. Lloyd George argued that thereafter, \\"the effort of Irish Nationalism to reconcile England and Ireland by uniting the two peoples in a common effort for the oppressed of another land failed, and Lord Kitchener's sinister order constituted the first word in a new chapter of Irish history\\". In the judgement of one historian, \\"Both political camps [nationalist and unionist] expected the gratitude of the British administration for their willingness to sacrifice themselves and the rank and file of their parties. Neither foresaw that in the First World War, all special interests would be expendable\\".Gillian McIntosh, The force of Culture, Unionist Identities in 20th Century Ireland p. 11 ==Recruitment== A total of 206,000 Irishmen served in the British forces during the war.Fergus Campbell, Land and Revolution, Nationalist Politics in the West of Ireland 1891‚Äì1921, p. 196 Of these, *58,000 were already enlisted in the British Regular Army or Navy before the war broke out, including: **21,000 serving regular soldiers, 18,000 reservists, 12,000 in the Special Reserve, 5,000 Naval ratings and 2,000 officers.David Fitzpatrick, Militarism in Ireland 1900‚Äì1922, in Thomas Bartlet, Keith Jeffrey, ed. A Military History of Ireland, p. 386 *130,000 were service volunteers recruited from Ireland for the duration of the war, including: **24,000 from the National Volunteers. **26,000 from the Ulster Volunteers. **80,000 with no experience in either of the paramilitary groups.Fitzpatrick, pp. 386‚Äì388 Of the wartime recruits, 137,000 went to the British Army, 6,000 to the Royal Navy and 4,000 to the Royal Air Force.Fitzpatrick, p388. Fitzpatrick is the source for all the figures in bullets points above According to historian David Fitzpatrick, \\"The proportion of eligible men who volunteered was well below that in Britain [...] even so, the participation of 200,000 Irishmen was proportionately the greatest deployment of armed manpower in the history of Irish militarism\\".Fitzpatrick, p. 388. The recruitment rate in Ulster matched that of Britain itself, Leinster and Munster were about two-thirds of the British rate of recruitment, while Connacht lagged behind them.Charles Townsend, 1916, The Easter Rising, p. 65 Overall, Protestants volunteered in higher proportions than Catholics,Coleman, Marie. The Irish Revolution, 1916‚Äì1923. Routledge, 2013. p.10 although in Ulster Catholics volunteered just as often as Protestants.James Loughin, in Ireland and the Great War: a war to unite us all? (Adrian Gregory, Senia Pa≈°eta Ed.s) pp. 141‚Äì142 The voluntary recruitment figures were: 44,000 Irishmen enlisted in 1914, 45,000 followed in 1915, but this dropped to 19,000 in 1916 and 14,000 in 1917.Fitzpatrick, p. 388 The 1918 figure has been given as between 11,000 and 15,655,Department of the Taoiseach: Irish Soldiers in the First World War Between August and November 1918 alone 9,845 were recruited.Ferriter, Diarmaid: \\"The Transformation of Ireland, 1900‚Äì2000\\", \\"1912‚Äì1918\\" p. 132 (note 66: quoting Fitzpatrick \\"Militarism in Ireland\\"), Profile Books, London (2004), 159 () ===Decline in recruitment=== John Dillon addresses an anti-conscription rally, 1918. Several factors contributed to the decline in recruitment after 1916. One was the heavy casualties suffered by Irish units in the war. The 10th Irish Division suffered very heavy losses during the Gallipoli campaign in 1915, while the 16th and 36th Divisions were shattered at the Battle of the Somme in 1916.Fitzpatrick p. 392 A second important factor was the Catholic Church's condemnation of the war in July 1915. Pope Benedict XV issued an encyclical calling on all powers to end the war and come to an agreement. As a result, the Irish Catholic Bishops publicly called on Redmond to withdraw Irish support for the war.Townshend p. 78 Thirdly, Irish troops in the British Army appear to have been treated with particular harshness even by the standards of the time. They constituted just two per cent of the membership of the force, yet they were the recipients of eight per cent (271) of all death sentences imposed by its courts-martial.BBC ‚Äì The forgotten soldiers (Article highlighting pre- and post-war attitudes to participation of Irish in Great War) Estimates on the number of executed ranging from 25 to 30 of the Irish war dead were victims of court martial executions.http://www.shotatdawn.info/page37.html Opposition to the war in Ireland may have therefore been influenced by perceived discrimination by British High Command against Irish soldiers, although within the Irish units death sentences were meted out in roughly equal proportions against Catholic and Protestant servicemen. On average one British soldier out of every 3,000 of their troops that died in the war did so due to being court martialed and executed by firing squad, compared to the much higher one out of every 600 of the Irish troops that died. Out of the total that were executed, 26 have since been retroactively pardoned. The fourth and perhaps most important reason was the rise of radical nationalism after the Easter Rising of 1916‚Äîan insurrection in Dublin by nationalists that left around 500 dead. Unlike the rest of the United Kingdom, conscription was never imposed on Ireland, a position it held with the British dominion of Australia in WWI. In the British dominion of Canada after conscription began there was a conscription crisis, in 1917, following this, when Irish conscription was proposed in the spring of 1918 (following the huge German Spring Offensive), it led to the Conscription Crisis of 1918, a mass assembly of civil disobedience and the proposal was dropped in May after the American entry into the War had helped stem the German advance. ===German support to separatists=== In a similar fashion to the nascent Indian Independence Movement, the Irish rebels collaborated with their Indian counterparts and mutually sought help from Germany during the War.Plowman, Matthew (2003), Irish Republicans and the Indo-German Conspiracy of World War I. New Hibernia Review 7.3, Center for Irish Studies at the University of St. Thomas, pp. 81‚Äì105, ISSN 1092-3977 The Germans sent a shipment of over 20,000 captured Mosin‚ÄìNagant Russian rifles, 10 machine guns and 4 million rounds of ammunition to aid the Irish Easter Rising. However the shipment was lost when the ship, the SS Libau, posing as the SS Aud was intercepted and scuttled by her captain off Fenit, County Kerry. After the Rising, they were in communication to send another, much larger weapons cache to Ireland in 1917, but the plan never materialised. Roger Casement tried to recruit a rebel unit from Irish prisoners of war in German captivity. The \\"Irish Brigade\\" drew only 55 recruits, however.Jerome aan de Wiel, Europe and the Irish Crisis 1900‚Äì1917, in Gabriel Doherty, Dermot Keogh, eds, 1916, The Long Revolution, pp. 36, 38, 42 ==Irish Divisions== Guildhall stained-glass window which commemorates the Three Irish Divisions, left the 36th, right the 10th and 16th. Of the Irish men who enlisted in the first year of the War, half were from what is now the Republic of Ireland; the other half were from what is now Northern Ireland. They joined new battalions of the eight regiments existing in Ireland. These battalions were assigned to brigades of the 8th Infantry Division, 10th (Irish) Division, the 16th (Irish) Division and the 36th (Ulster) Division of Kitchener's New Service Army, as well as to brigades of other United Kingdom Divisions during the course of the war. A proportion of the Irish National Volunteers (INV) enlisted with regiments of both the 10th and 16th Divisions, but were predominantly in the 16th division, members of the Ulster Volunteers (UVF), joined regiments of the 36th Division. Military historian Timothy Bowman states that 'While Kitchener saw the UVF as an efficient military force and was prepared to offer concessions to secure the services of UVF personnel in the British army his view of the INV was very different. The INV were, even in comparison to the UVF, an inefficient military force in 1914, lacked trained officers, finances and equipment. Kitchener was certainly not inclined to, as he saw it, waste valuable officers and equipment on such a force which, at best, would relieve Territorial units from garrison duties and, at worst, would provide Irish Nationalists with the ability [by training them in the means of War] to enforce Home Rule [when they returned] on their own terms'.Bowman, Timothy.: Irish Regiments in the Great War \\"Raising the Service battalions\\" p. 67, Manchester Uni. Press (2003) In spite of these criticisms, the 16th division gained a reputation as first- class shock troops during engagements in 1916.Murphy, David: Irish Regiments in the World Wars, The Irish Divisions, 1914‚Äì18: the 16th (Irish) Division pp. 16‚Äì17, Osprey Publishing (2007) Daily Express London, pp. 1, 5, 12 Sept. 1916 The Irish regiments of the three divisions and the BEF as a whole appear to have suffered from few serious disciplinary or morale problems during March to November 1918.Bowman p. 183 ===10th Division=== The 10th (Irish) Division, was one of Kitchener's New Army K1 Army Group divisions formed in August 1914. Raised largely in Ireland from the Irish National Volunteers, it fought at Gallipoli, Salonika and Palestine and was the first Irish Division to take the field in war, under the command of Irish General Bryan Mahon and was the most travelled of the Irish formations. Sent to Gallipoli it participated on 7 August 1915 in the disastrous Landing at Cape Helles and the August offensive. Some battalions of the division were engaged at Chunuk Bair. In September when the Suvla front became a stalemate, the division was moved to Salonika where it fought Bulgarian troops and remained for two years. In September 1917 the division transferred to Egypt where it joined the XX Corps. The division fought in the Third Battle of Gaza which succeeded in breaking the resistance of the Turkish defenders in southern Palestine. The 10th Division was persistently under-strength due to heavy losses and \\"sluggish enlistment\\" and as a result was filled up early on with drafts from England.Townshend, p. 74 Because of this, historian Charles Townshend has suggested that, \\"it was an Irish unit in name only\\" and was the \\"least politicised of the three [Divisions] raised in Ireland\\".Townshend p. 75 The division was furthermore broken up in 1918, split between the Middle East and Western Front. Military historian Timothy Bowman points out: 'Following the German Spring Offensive, in a situation where the BEF was facing serious manpower problems on the Western Front, saw that six Irish battalions were released from the Middle East for service on the Western Front, so that the experience of its Service battalions could be spread through other formations, their place being taken by Indian Army battalions. A second practical problem for the 10th Division to be split up was widespread malaria, with the likelihood of it being permanently unfit for action.Bowman, Timothy.: Irish Regiments in the Great War \\"The final phase\\" pp. 174‚Äì75, Manchester Uni. Press (2003) ===16th Division=== The 16th (Irish) Division was a K2 Army Group division of Kitchener's New Army, formed in Ireland in September 1914 and raised around a core of the National Volunteers. The division began forming towards the end of 1914 after Irish recruits first filled the ranks of the 10th Division. Initial training began in Ireland. It moved to England for more intensive training in September 1915. In December the division moved to France, joining the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), under the command of Irish Major General William Hickie, and spent the duration of the war in action on the Western Front. Until March 1916 the division was part of IV Corps, commanded by the staunch unionist Henry Wilson. Wilson, who had called the division \\"Johnnie Redmond's pets\\", inspected them over the course of a few days over Christmas 1915, noting that they \\"appear to be inferior\\" and that \\"at least 50p.c. are quite useless, old whiskey-sodden militiamen\\". Hickie agreed that he had \\"a political Divn of riff raff Redmondites\\". Wilson thought 47th brigade had \\"old officers, old & useless men, very bad musketry, rotten boots, and altogether a very poor show\\". Wilson reported to the Army Commander Monro (6 January) that the division, despite having been training since September‚ÄìOctober 1914, would not be fit to serve in an active part of the line for six weeks. Although political prejudice probably played a part in Wilson's views, he also attributed much of the difference in quality between his divisions to training, especially of officers, in which he took a keen personal interest, opposing Haig's wish to delegate training from corps to division level.Jeffery 2006, pp. 156‚Äì58 Major General William Hickie took over from Lt. General Sir Lawrence Parsons in December 1915. Hickie was, in public, much more diplomatic and tactful than his predecessors and spoke of the pride which his new command gave him.Irish Regiments in the Great War p. 119, Timothy Bowmann (2003) At Loos in January and February 1916 they got their introduction to trench warfare and suffered greatly in the Battle of Hulluch, 27‚Äì29 April, during the Easter Rising. They raided German trenches all through May and June, and in late July were moved to the Somme Valley where they were intensively engaged in the Battle of the Somme. The 16th division was critical in capturing the towns of Guillemont and Ginchy (both part of the Battle of the Somme), though they suffered massive casualties. A London newspaper headlined How the Irish took Ginchy ‚Äì Splendid daring of the Irish troops The former Nationalist MP for East Tyrone, lawyer and economics professor at UCD, Tom Kettle was killed in this battle. During these two successful actions between 1 and 10 September its casualties amounted to 224 officers and 4,090 men; despite these very heavy losses the division gained a reputation as first-class shock troops. Out of a total of 10,845 men, it had lost 3,491 on the Loos sector between January and the end of May 1916, including heavy casualties from bombardment and a heavy chlorine and phosgene Gas attack at Hulluch in April. Bloodletting of this order was fatal to the division's character, and it had to be refilled by male conscripts from England.Duffy, Christopher: Through German Eyes \\"The British & the Somme 1916\\" p. 101, Phoenix of Orion Books (2007) In early 1917, the division took a major part in the Battle of Messines alongside the 36th (Ulster) Division, adding duly to both their recognition and reputation. Their major actions ended in the summer of 1917 at the Battle of Passchendaele after moving under General Hubert Gough's Fifth Army command. In July 1917 during the Third Battle of Ypres, although both divisions were totally exhausted after 13 days of moving heavy equipment under heavy shelling he ordered their battalions advance through deep mud towards well fortified German positions left untouched by totally inadequate artillery preparation.Prior, Robin & Wilson, Trevor: Passchendaele, the untold story, \\"Gough, Rain\\" pp. 102‚Äì05, (1997) By mid-August, the 16th had suffered over 4,200 casualties and the 36th had suffered almost 3,600 casualties, or more than 50 percent of their numbers.Prior, Wilson p. 103 General Gough was later dismissed at the start of April 1918. The 16th Division held an exposed position since early 1918 at Ronssoy where they suffered heavy losses during the German March Spring Offensive and in the retreat which followed, being practically wiped out when they helped to finally halt the German attack prior to the Battle of Hamel. The decision was then made to break up the division, the three surviving Service battalions posted to other formations.Bowman, Timothy: p. 171 In June the division was \\"reconstituted\\" in England. The \\"16th Division\\" which returned to France on 27 July contained 5 English Battalions, 2 Scottish Battalions and 1 Welsh Battalion. The only original Battalion left was the 5th Royal Irish Fusiliers. The dispersion of the Irish battalions throughout the BEF in 1918, despite its practical considerations, does appear to suggest that the Irish units were increasingly distrusted by the military authorities.Bowman, Timothy: p. 176 ===36th Division=== The 36th (Ulster) Division was a K6 Army Group division of Lord Kitchener's New Army formed in September 1914. Originally called the Ulster Division, it was made up of members of the Ulster Volunteer Force who formed thirteen additional battalions for three existing Irish regiments; the Royal Irish Fusiliers, the Royal Irish Rifles and the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers. The division served on the Western Front for the duration of the war. Its insignia was the Red Hand of Ulster. The division was authorised on 28 October 1914. It was based on the formation and membership of the Ulster Volunteer Force to which a London-based artillery unit was added. It contained men from all nine counties of Ulster. After training moved to France early October 1915. The 36th was one of the few divisions to make significant gains on the first day on the Somme in July 1916, when it attacked between the Ancre and Thiepval against a position known as the Schwaben Redoubt, according to military historian Martin Middlebrook. During the Battle of the Somme the Ulster Division was the only division of X Corps to have achieved its objectives on the opening day of the battle. This came at a heavy price, with the division suffering in two days of fighting, 5,500 officers and men, killed, wounded or missing. War correspondent Philip Gibbs said of the division, ‚Äò'Their attack was one of the finest displays of human courage in the world'‚Äô. Of nine Victoria Crosses awarded to British forces in the battle, four were given to 36th Division soldiers. The division's other battle engagements included: the Battle of Cambrai, Battle of Messines, Battle of Ypres (1917), Battle of Ypres (1918), Battle of Courtrai, Battle of the St Quentin Canal. The 36th (Ulster) Division, on the other hand, had a variable performance and after it was badly cut-up and collapsed during the March 1918 Spring Offensive, the division in this case was reorganised and its battalions brought up to strength.Bowman pp. 173‚Äì74 Both the 16th and 36th Divisions had also lost much of their original character by the end of the war. According to David Fitzpatrick, \\"Eventually heavy casualties and insufficient recruitment ensured that all three Irish Divisions were restocked with British recruits and effectively dismembered\\".Fitzpatrick, p. 392 ===Irish regiments=== The Childers Reforms linked regiments to recruiting districts ‚Äì in the case of Ireland to eight regimental recruiting areas, see end, also. Militarily, the whole of Ireland was administered as a separate command with Command Headquarters at Parkgate (Phoenix Park) Dublin, directly under the War Office in London.Harris, General H.E.D.: The Irish Regiments in the First World War (1968) pp. 2‚Äì3 Irish regiments engaged in the war were in the first place the old professional regiments, their battalions raised and garrisoned in Ireland, serving with the regular British army. They were: Royal Irish Regiment, Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, Royal Irish Rifles, Princess Victoria's (Royal Irish Fusiliers), Connaught Rangers, Prince of Wales's Leinster Regiment (Royal Canadians), Royal Dublin Fusiliers and Royal Munster Fusiliers. These regiments were assigned to Brigades of the following United Kingdom Divisions: the 1st, 6th, 14th, 24th, 27th, 29th, 30th, 31st, 34th, 50th, 57th, 66th Divisions. After the outbreak of hostilities in August 1914 the regimental garrisons raised additional new service battalions in Ireland for voluntary enlistment in the three New Irish Divisions of Kitchener's New Service Army. In March 1918 after the 10th and 16th Irish Divisions were broken up due to heavy casualties, their remaining New Service Battalions were dispersed throughout the above United Kingdom Divisions. Irishmen also enlisted in other Irish regiments of the regular British army based elsewhere in England, Scotland and Wales (some Irish in name only). These included four regular cavalry regiments (the 4th (Royal Irish) Dragoon Guards, the 5th (Royal Irish) Lancers, the 6th (Inniskilling) Dragoons, and the 8th (King's Royal Irish) Hussars), a regular infantry regiment (the Irish Guards), two cavalry regiments of the Special Reserve (the North Irish Horse and the South Irish Horse), two units of the Territorial Force (the Liverpool Irish and the London Irish Rifles) and the war-raised Tyneside Irish Brigade of Kitchener's Army. Many Irish immigrants in other parts of the world also joined local Irish units, such as Canada's 199th (Duchess of Connaught's Own Irish Rangers) Battalion, CEF, or in the United States in the Irish American 69th Infantry Regiment. ==Theatres of WarWestern Front=== First shot The first United Kingdom engagement in Europe of the War was made by the 4th Royal Irish Dragoon Guards on 22 August 1914. They encountered several German cavalrymen on patrol near Mons, when Corporal Edward Thomas had the distinction of firing the first British army shot in Europe in the War,The War Illustrated, Who fired the First Shot? during which some of the Germans were killed and others captured. Mons, Givenchy, 1914 The Germans were pushing their advance through Belgium to encircle Paris within three weeks (Schlieffen Plan), when on 27 August the 2nd Battalion Royal Munster Fusiliers was chosen for the arduous task of forming the rearguard to cover the retreat of the British Expeditionary Force during the Battle of Mons. The Munsters were only to retreat if ordered. They made an epic stand losing 9 officers and 87 other ranks holding out in a famous action at the village of √âtreux,The √âtreux Rearguard Action External link to Home Page: Royal Munster Fusiliers Association many others surrounded and taken prisoner. They stemmed the Germans who were five or six times their strength for over a day, allowing their 1st Division to escape. When the scattered battalion reassembled on 29 August it was down to a disastrous 5 officers and 196 others. These were withdrawn and by November recruits from home brought its strength up to over 800 men. The battalion was moved south to the Festubert sector in France on 22 November to fill a gap by taking two lines of trenches. There were 200 casualties in the first 10 minutes of heavy fire. On 25 January, the Kaiser's birthday, the Germans tried unsuccessfully to break through with terrific shellfire. There then followed three months of rebuilding and training the battalion. The Irish Guards also suffered heavily in battle of Mons, like the Munsters, having to fight a rearguard action while withdrawing from Bois de l'Haut. They took over 300 casualties but managed to retreat intact.Michael Barthorp, The Old Contemptibles, Osprey 1989, p. 45 The Munsters' and Irish Guards' experience was typical of the decimation of the highly trained pre-war British Army in the campaigns of 1914 in France and Belgium. By the end of 1914, those regiments deployed in the original British Expeditionary Force had been shattered by very heavy casualties. On average, in each battalion of 1,000 men, only one officer and 30 men remained unscathed.Michael Barthorp, The Old COntemptibles, Osprey 1989, p. 55 For this reason, it was necessary to deploy, first reservists to replace casualties, and then the wartime volunteers of Kitchener's New Army (including the 10th, 16th and 36th Irish Divisions), in order to fight a war of an unprecedented scale. St Julien, 1915 While the 2nd Battle of Ypres raged in May the 2nd Royal Dublin Fusiliers were nearly wiped out as a result of a German-initiated poison gas attack. There were 666 personnel at the outset and 21 survived. At the end of 1915 the 16th (Irish) Division entered the trenches on the Western Front under the command of Irish Major-General William Hickie. Dublin, 1916 As the number of Irish war casualties increased with little prospect of early victory, the Irish Volunteers continued to train and resisted any attempt to disarm them. They organised an Easter Rising in Dublin for 24 April. Roughly 1,200 Volunteers and Irish Citizen Army members took over the city centre. About 5,000 troops in the Dublin area were deployed to suppress the rebellion. An additional 1,000 were immediately sent from Belfast and further thousands were dispatched from Athlone, The Curragh and England. The 4th, 5th and 10th Royal Dublin Fusiliers took part, as did a number of officers and soldiers who were on leave in Dublin at the time. By the end of the week, 16,000 British troops had been deployed to Dublin.Peter Cottrell, The Anglo-Irish War, p. 35 Casualties were 62 rebels killed, 132 British Army and Police dead and 368 wounded. Another 270 civilians were killed and over 2,000 wounded.Townsend, p. 393 In all, just 16 police and 22 of the British soldiers killed were Irishmen.Kilberd, Declan: 1916, Rebellion Handbook, pp. 50‚Äì55 Another 16 rebels, the rebel leaders - the seven signatories of the Proclamation of Irish Independence, Padraig Pearse, James Connolly, √âamonn Ceannt, Thomas James Clarke, Se√°n MacDiarmada, Thomas MacDonagh, and Joseph Mary Plunkett as well as nine others - were executed by the British Army, without trial, after the Rising. It was generally accepted that the Irish Volunteers fought bravely and honourably. Prime Minister Asquith told the House of Commons that \\"they fought bravely and did not resort to outrage.\\" The series of executions helped to swing Nationalist support away from the Parliamentary Party and behind Sinn F√©in.Kilbred, Declan; pp. 50‚Äì55 Hulluch, 1916 A German gas attack on 27 April in the Battle of Hulluch caused 385 casualties. The 16th (Irish) Division remained in Loos-en-Gohelle until August. They then moved to The Somme but not before suffering 6,000 casualties, including 1,496 deaths. One major event of this period‚Äîthe Easter Rising in Dublin, it was concluded by a number of historians, that the Rising had no detrimental impact on Irish troops, even on those with Republican sympathies.Bowman, Timothy, Irish Regiments in the Great War, Ch. 4: Adjusting and adapting, p. 127, Manchester University Press (2003) Battle of the Somme, 1916 The Battle of the Somme commenced early on 1 July and the day ended with a total of 60,000 allied casualties of whom 20,000 were killed in action. The 36th (Ulster) Division suffered 5,500 casualties and 2,000 of these were killed in action. The 1st Royal Dublin Fusiliers fought next to the 36th and endured 147 casualties ‚Äì 22 killed and 64 missing in action. The 2nd Royal Dublin Fusiliers lost 14 of their 23 officers 311 out of a total of 480 in other ranks. There was also Irish participation in 1st Royal Irish Rifles, 1st Royal Irish Fusiliers, 1st Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers and 2nd Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, 2nd Royal Irish Regiment, in four battalions of the Northumberland Fusiliers. The Battle continued until the following November when it was ended as a consequence of inclement weather. While progress was limited the 16th (Irish) Division captured Guillemont on 2 September and Ginchy on 9 September. A London newspaper headlined How the Irish took Ginchy ‚Äì Spendid daring of the Irish troopsDaily Express London, pp.1, 5, 12 Sept. 1916 The former Nationalist MP for East Tyrone, lawyer and economics professor at UCD, Tom Kettle was killed at the Somme. Messines Ridge, June 1917 Following the successful engagement of the Dublin Fusiliers during the Arras Offensive in April, the 16th (Irish) and 36th (Ulster) Divisions fought alongside each other to capture the Belgium village of Wijtschate in a well planned attack in June 1917 at the Battle of Messines. It saw the largest ever concentration of Irish soldiers on a battlefield. Their advance across awful county has been reported by all who saw it as a sight never to be forgotten, a captured German officer stated that they moved as if on parade. They took all of their objectives on schedule despite the loss of nearly all of their supporting tanks. The subsequent battle was a complete success militarily, the two divisions showing great fortitude‚Äîthe Germans were no match for them as they mopped up all resistance, advancing over two miles in a few days with minimal losses, incredible by Western Front standards.Martin Staunton: The Royal Munster Fusiliers (1914‚Äì1919) MA thesis UCD (1986) pp. 276‚Äì277. One of those lost in the advance on 17 June was 56-year-old Major Willie Redmond MP for East Clare and other constituencies for 34 years. He was a brother of John Redmond, leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party. Passchendaele, July 1917 The following month, July 1917, both Divisions moved under the command of General Sir Hubert Gough, Commander of the British Fifth Army, who had little regard for the Irish, and who ordered an advance to the east of Ypres towards well fortified German positions left untouched by totally inadequate British artillery preparation during the Third Battle of Ypres. By mid-August, the 16th (Irish) had suffered over 4,200 casualties and the 36th (Ulster) had suffered almost 3,600 casualties, or more than 50 percent of their numbers. Fr Willie Doyle a Jesuit and chaplain to the 10th (Irish) Division was killed. He had been awarded the Military Cross and was nominated for the Victoria Cross for his commendable bravery. The poet Francis Ledwidge was killed on 31 July. Spring Offensive, March 1918 The 16th (Irish) Division and the 36th (Ulster) Division were almost completely wiped out due to Gough's insufficient defence preparations for the expected great German Spring Offensive towards Amiens in March 1918. One third of the total personnel were killed‚Äîover 6,400 in the 16th and over 6,100 in the 36th, which also resulted in the April conscription crisis. Irish manpower was reallocated to other Divisions when following the American campaigns they took part in the final Hundred Days Offensive which by October drove the Germans back from territory gained in the previous four years, to end the war. ===Middle East Fronts=== Gallipoli, 1915 A stalemate on the Western Front prompted an alternative approach to beating Germany by opening a second front in the east for which Russia needed urgent aid from the Mediterranean, to launch an assault to tie down the German army. However, as the Ottoman Empire controlled the Bosporus sea passage, the Royal Navy tried to sail up the Dardanelles in March but several ships were lost. As a result, Irish, British, French, Australian and New Zealand troops were formed into the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force and transported from Britain to Gallipoli for a land invasion. In the Gallipoli Campaign an invasion was attempted at six locations in April but Turkish defences kept the advance close to the beach. Irish battalions suffered extremely heavy losses during the V beach Landing at Cape Helles which was the most important of the landings and defended by four entrenched Turkish machine gun posts. The main force was deployed from the SS River Clyde, a 4,000 ton converted collier. The ship held 2,000 men; the 1st Battalion of the Royal Munster Fusiliers plus two companies of the 2nd Battalion, the Hampshire Regiment and one company of the 1st Battalion Royal Dublin Fusiliers. The first approach to V Beach was made by the Royal Dublin Fusiliers in boats that were towed or rowed. The remaining battalions followed. Wave after wave of men were mown down as they attempted to reach shore. Few succeeded, but they never faltered.Steel, Nigel and Hart, Peter Defeat at Gallipoli pp. 90‚Äì96, Pan Books (1994) (2002), Their efforts to build a bridgehead were in vain, suffering over 600 Irish casualties in a 36-hour period. Another attempt was made in August but this too failed. Winston Churchill who had proposed the venture resigned from Government. Serbia, 1915 With the Bulgarian invasion of Serbia, both Greece and Serbia requested Allied help. A force of 2,454 attached to the 10th (Irish) Division sailed from Gallipoli to Salonika on 29 September to fight on the Bulgarian front during the Macedonian campaign. There the Royal Dublin 6th/7th Battalions and Munsters 6th/7th Battalions were deployed to take the village of Jenikoj (present-day Novo Selo?), during which they suffered 385 casualties. In December, still wearing summer uniforms, the severe snow and frost caused many casualties. The 10th Division, which included Connaught Rangers, together with the Anglo-French forces having failed to prevent the fall of Serbia after the Bulgarian forces made intensive progress, were ordered to retreat. They remained at Salonika, where during 1916 they were built up to strength again. Greece, 1916 The Bulgarians, with German support, crossed the Greek frontier on 26 May 1916. The 10th Division was first sent into action in August along the Struma River valley, coming into action against the Bulgarians on 30 September in the 'Struma offensive', crossing the river and taking the village of Yenikoi (present-day Provatas in Serres Prefecture, Greece)Fallingrain.com website, then after a Bulgarian counterattack retaking it, but at the cost of 500 men. Now well below strength, also due to the malaria in summer and lack of recruits, they remained in Provatos. The division withstood further Bulgarian attacks in March 1917. In late summer the 10th was withdrawn to be re-engaged to stem the Turks in Palestine. Palestine, 1917 Embarking from Salonika, they arrived via Egypt in Ismalia on 12. September. October was spent training after a redress, before entering the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. After the Battle of Gaza and the Turkish withdrawal early November, the 10th Division was refitted and returned to the line at the end of November. It encountered considerable sniper fire on the way to the capture of Jerusalem, which was entered unopposed on 9. December. With relatively low losses the division had taken what was asked of it. After so many defeats since Gallipoli, they at last tasted victory. Into 1918 was spent on reconstruction work. Fighting flared up again in March which required an advance towards Nablis. This enemy engagement was to be the last action in Palestine. France, 1918 Heavy losses encountered on the Western Front after the great German Spring Offensive, resulted in the transfer of 60,000 men from Palestine to France, including ten battalions of the 10th Division. They embarked at Alexandria arriving Marseilles on 2 June 1918 and were transferred to the 2RMF for the beginning of the Hundred Days Offensive. For continuation, see 'Spring Offensive, March 1918' above. ==Casualties== The number of Irish deaths in the British Army recorded by the registrar general was 27,405, a casualty rate of 14 percent, roughly in line with the rest of the British forces. By contrast, the National War Memorial at Islandbridge, Dublin is dedicated \\"to the memory of the 49,400 Irish soldiers who gave their lives in the Great War, 1914‚Äì1918\\".D√∫chas The Heritage Service, Visitors Guide to the Gardens This figure is often questioned. Recent estimates for Northern Ireland are given at up to 20,000 casualties, and between 30,000 and 35,000 for the whole of Ireland. It has been suggested that the often-cited death toll of 40‚Äì50,000 refers to all the fatalities in the Irish Divisions. In fact, only 71 percent of the casualties in these Divisions were natives of Ireland. According to the Irish National War Memorial, the figure of 49,400 is inclusive of recent Irish immigrants living in America. The dead were buried close to the battlefield, but some of the seriously injured were sent to convalesce in Ireland. Those who died of their wounds in Ireland were buried in the Grangegorman Military Cemetery, if their bodies were not claimed by their families. The majority of those buried in Grangegorman are from the Great War. ==Demobilisation and post war experience== The War ended with the Armistice on 11 November; a war that had the active participation of an estimated 210,000 Irish men and women in the British forces and more in other allied armies. When the Irish Divisions raised for the war were demobilised, roughly 100,000 war veterans returned to Ireland. This indicates that in the region of 70‚Äì80,000 decided to live elsewhere.Fitzpatrick, p. 397 Several reasons may explain this, one being high unemployment in Ireland and another being the rise of militant nationalism in the country, which in many cases was hostile to those who had served in the British forces. In 1919 the Irish land act (provision for Sailors and Soldiers) was enacted to provide approximately 5000 houses and state-aided housing welfare for soldiers returning from the war.Article by FHA Aalen, 1988 Most of these houses were constructed in the late 1920s (after the formation of the Irish Free State), and intended to facilitate the reinstatement of ex- servicemen into civilian life. With the outbreak of the guerrilla conflict, the Irish War of Independence (1919‚Äì1921), in which the Irish Republican Army attacked the police and British military, ex-servicemen were in a divisive situation. For veterans who became involved, some like Tom Barry who had served in the British Army in WWI along with Emmet Dalton joined the IRA sometime after armistice day. While many joined paramilitary police forces, the Black and Tans and Auxiliary Division, charged with putting down the guerrillas. In County Clare, for example, 15 locals joined the Auxiliaries, all of whom were war veterans, while 46 joined the Black and Tans, of whom 25 had served in the British ArmyPadraig Og O Ruairc, Blood on the Banner, The Republican Struggle in Clare, pp. 332‚Äì333 Similarly in Northern Ireland, many ex-servicemen joined the Ulster Special Constabulary ‚Äì an armed Auxiliary police force raised for counter-insurgency purposes. Over half of this (mostly Protestant and Unionist) force's 32,000 recruits were veterans of the Great War.Alan F Parkinson, Belfast's Unholy War, p. 86 British veterans, along with numbers of Irish veterans of WWI who served in the British army joined the Black and Tans after the war, approximately 10% of the Black & Tan's recruits and 14% of the Auxiliaries were Irishmen.Lowe, W.J. \\"Who were the Black-and- Tans?‚Äù History Ireland Autumn 2004 with this organisation then going on to perpetrate a number of atrocities during the Irish War of Independence. For these reasons, many nationalists were reluctant for many years to recognise the part that Irishmen had played in the world war on Britain's side. The majority of ex-servicemen, who took no active part in the conflict, were however in some cases subjected to suspicion and intimidation by the IRA due to, amongst other things, having pledged allegiance to the British Empire as a prerequisite before their participation in the British Army.Leonard, Jane: Getting them at last: The IRA and ex-servicemen, in Fitzpatrick, Dr. David, ed, Revolution? Ireland 1917‚Äì1923, Trinity History Publications, Dublin (1990) pp. 118‚Äì29: \\"Despite the British Military background of some of their members, the IRA waged 'a campaign of intimidation' against ex-servicemen in 1919‚Äì21.\\" Some were targeted by the IRA for allegedly giving information to British forces, and for example, a total of 29 ex-servicemen were shot dead in County Cork as suspected informers.Hart, Peter: The IRA and its Enemies pp. 303‚Äì04 In total out of around 200 civilians killed by the IRA as informers, 82 were ex- servicemen.Marie Coleman, Longford and the Irish Revolution, p. 154 When most of Ireland left the United Kingdom on the formation of the Irish Free State in 1922, the five regular, full-time Irish regiments whose recruiting areas were in southern Ireland: the Royal Dublin Fusiliers, the Royal Munster Fusiliers, the Connaught Rangers, and the Royal Irish Regiment, that had suffered so severely in the Great War, were disbanded.Murphy, David: Irish Regiments in the World Wars p. 30 quote: \\"Following the treaty that established the independent Irish Free State in 1922, it was decided to disband the regiments that had their traditional recruiting grounds in southern Ireland: The Royal Irish Regiment; The Connaught Rangers; The Prince of Wales' Leinster Regiment; The Royal Munster Fusiliers; The Royal Dublin Fusiliers; The South Irish Horse\\" Osprey Publishing (2007) While in some cases renamed or amalgamated, the remaining regular Irish regiments continued in service. These comprised the Irish Guards, the 5th Royal Inniskilling Dragoon Guards, the 8th King's Royal Irish Hussars, the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, the Royal Ulster Rifles and the Royal Irish Fusiliers. Thousands of these ex-servicemen re-enlisted in the emerging Free State's newly formed National Army on the pro-Treaty side after the outbreak in June 1922, of the Irish Civil War, during which multiple atrocities were committed. In July 1922 the D√°il authorised raising a force of 35,000 men; by May 1923 this had grown to 58,000. The National Army lacked the expertise necessary to train a force of that size, such that approximately one fifth of its officers and half of its soldiers were Irish ex-servicemen of the British Army and men like Martin Doyle, Emmet Dalton, W. R. E. Murphy, and Henry Kelly brought considerable combat experience to it.Cottrell, Peter: The Irish Civil War 1922‚Äì23, p.23+p.51, Osprey Publishing Ltd. (2008) W.R.E. Murphy rose to second in command in the Free State's National Army in the civil war and after became Commissioner of the Dublin Metropolitan Police. ==CommemorationIn the Free State and the Republic of Ireland=== Due to the complexity of the Irish experience during the Great War, and the hostility of much nationalist thinking to those who had fought in it on the British side, the Irishmen who fought and died in the war were not officially acknowledged for many years. According to historian Michael Hopkinson, \\"Large elements of Irish society were effectively excluded from Irish politics; Sinn F√©in represented only part of the Irish nation. The virtual ban on the commemoration of the Irish dead of the First World War dramatically illustrates this\\".Michael Hopkinson, The Irish War of Independence, p. 202 From 1919‚Äì1925, Remembrance Day was marked with a ceremony on College Green in central Dublin. However this service was consistently marked by rioting between nationalists, unionists and ex-servicemen. In 1925, after Irish Independence, it was relocated to the Phoenix Park, outside the city centre, ostensibly for \\"traffic reasons\\".Keith Jeffery, Ireland and the Great War, pp. 115‚Äì116 The IRA, an illegal group after its defeat in the civil war of 1922‚Äì23, sometimes attacked Poppy Appeal sellers and disrupted Remembrance Day events throughout the 1920s and 1930s.Brian Hanley, The IRA 1926‚Äì1936, p. 71 Although the Irish government donated ¬£50,000 in 1927 towards the construction of a Great War Memorial in Dublin, they put it in Islandbridge, outside the city centre, rather than in Merrion Square as originally proposed. Government minister Kevin O'Higgins (whose two brothers had served in the world war) summed up the dilemma of the moderate nationalist Cumann na nGaedheal government, The Republican opposition of Fianna F√°il was much more hostile, Although the Memorial Park was opened in 1948, it was not until 2006 that the Irish state held an official commemoration there for the Irish dead of the First World War, when President of Ireland Mary McAleese and the Taoiseach Bertie Ahern, marked the 90th anniversary of the Battle of the Somme on 1 July. Introduced in 1986, the National Day of Commemoration held each July in the Royal Hospital Kilmainham commemorates \\"all Irish people who died in past wars or United Nations peacekeeping missions\\". Charles Lysaght commented \\"it does less than justice to the Irish who went to the First World War to lump them in with all the Irish who died in the service of other countries\\". The unveiling of a Cross of Sacrifice to honour Irish soldiers who died in both world wars, took place at Glasnevin Cemetery, Dublin, on 31 July 2014. It was unveiled by the President of Ireland Michael D. Higgins together with the President of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, the Duke of Kent, who both laid wreaths. The Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht Heather Humphreys also attended the ceremony, which coincided with the centenary of the outbreak of World War I. ===In Northern Ireland=== Northern Ireland, where the War was seen by unionists as a mark of British patriotism, has always officially commemorated the dead of both world wars on Armistice Day. For unionists, their contribution to the First World War, in particular, was a potent symbol of their loyalty to Britain. In the words of Keith Jeffrey, \\"It marks the Union sealed with blood. It stands for the ultimate test of Ulster's loyalty: a Blood Sacrifice to match any by Irish Nationalists\\".McIntoch, The Force of Culture, p. 12 For this reason although Northern Catholics had enlisted during the War just as often as Protestants, they were excluded from the War's Commemoration, which became an almost exclusively Unionist event.James Loughin, in Ireland and the Great War: a war to unite us all? (Adrian Gregory, Senia Pa≈°eta Eds.) pp. 141‚Äì142 Today at the Somme, there is a monument to the 36th (Ulster) Division at Thiepval, but only two little Celtic crosses to commemorate the 16th (Irish) Division.Corrigan, Gordan: Mud, Blood and Poppycock p. 289, Cassel Military Paperbacks (2004) The 16th (Irish) Division was made up of Irish nationalists and thus was predominantly Catholic, and for the best part of the rest of the 20th century it was almost eliminated from the historiography of the Great War, while at the same time the achievements of the 36th (Ulster) Division became part of the culture of Northern Irish Protestants.Duffy, Christopher: Through German Eyes \\"The British & the Somme 1916\\" pp. 207‚Äì7, Phoenix of Orion Books (2007) ==Memorials== Memorials commemorating those Irish who served and died in the Great War: * Irish National War Memorial Gardens * Island of Ireland Peace Park Messines, Belgium. * Menin Gate Memorial Ypres, Belgium. * Ulster Tower Memorial Thiepval, France. * Pery Square War Memorial, Limerick ==Infantry and Special Reserve regiments raised in Ireland== {  !Original title !Changes !Regular battalions !Militia battalions !Depot !Regimental area !Divisions served - The Connaught Rangers Disbanded 1922 88th (Connaught Rangers) Regiment of Foot 94th Regiment of Foot South Mayo Rifles Militia Galway Militia Roscommon Militia North Mayo Fusiliers Militia City of Galway County Galway, County Leitrim, County Mayo, Co.

The second surviving son of the highly regarded Admiral Adam Duncan, 1st Viscount Duncan, who defeated the Dutch Navy at the Battle of Camperdown in 1797, Duncan achieved a successful career in his own right, operating with great success against French and Italian shipping and shore fortifications in the Mediterranean during the Napoleonic Wars. For his services he was knighted and given numerous honours before dying at the young age of 49 from a sudden apoplexy in 1835. ==Early career== Henry Duncan was born in 1786, the second surviving son of Adam Duncan, then a captain in the Royal Navy, later to become the admiral who defeated the Dutch fleet at the Battle of Camperdown and thus became Viscount Duncan. Henry's elder brother Robert inherited the titles on their father's death and was later created Earl of Camperdown. Their mother, Henrietta, was the daughter of Robert Dundas, a prominent Scottish judge. Following his father into the Navy at 14 in 1800, Duncan served as a midshipman on board the frigate HMS Maidstone until the Peace of Amiens the following year.The Gentleman's Magazine, January to June 1835 Vol. 5, p. 307‚Äì309 When the Navy was expanded once more at the outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars in 1803, Duncan joined HMS Narcissus in the Eastern Mediterranean and served in operations in the Aegean Sea and off Egypt. With Narcissus ordered back to Britain in 1804, Duncan joined the first rate HMS Royal Sovereign under Admiral Sir Richard Bickerton as a lieutenant and it was aboard this ship that he received news of the death of his father. The death of such a senior officer was marked by numerous letters of condolence, including one from Horatio Nelson which offered command of the small brig , whose captain Robert Corbet had been taken ill. When Duncan arrived to take command however Corbet had recovered and was restored to command. Duncan was instead promoted to commander and returned to Britain to take over the 18-gun in the Channel Fleet. ==Post captain== Returning to the Mediterranean, Duncan was promoted to post captain in 1806 and took over the sixth rate HMS Porcupine in 1807, sent to serve in the Adriatic campaign by operating off the coast of the Kingdom of Italy. In 1808 he moved to the small frigate HMS Mercury engaged on the same service, raiding French harbours in the Adriatic Sea and Eastern Mediterranean. During these operations, he captured numerous coastal merchant ships and destroyed large quantities of military supplies. With Mercury in a poor state of repair, Duncan was ordered to escort the Mediterranean merchant shipping back to Britain and pay the ship off, arriving in early 1810 after a stormy passage. Duncan was then given the large frigate HMS Imperieuse and commanded her in the Western Mediterranean off Toulon and Tripoli, seizing a number of French merchant ships. Raiding the Northwestern coast of Italy, Duncan succeeded in capturing numerous ships and destroying large quantities of supplies in fortified harbours before Imperieuse was forced to undergo extensive repairs in Port Mahon. Offered two other frigates as replacements, Duncan was presented with a letter from Imperieuse's crew declaring their regard and respect for him and asking him not to move to another ship without them. Moved by this letter, Duncan remained with the ship and was given command of a squadron to operate against the Kingdom of Naples. ==Post war service== Returning to Britain in 1814 at the end of the War of the Sixth Coalition, Imperieuse was paid off and Duncan given command of the new HMS Glasgow. Operating off the Spanish Atlantic coast and in the Bay of Biscay, Duncan saw little action before the final end to the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 and his ship was paid off in September. Appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath, Duncan was unemployed for three years before taking over the 50-gun fifth rate HMS Liffey which he commanded on anti-pirate operations in the West Indies and later escorted the Prince Regent on his fleet inspection in 1819, during which he praised Duncan and his ship. He subsequently conveyed Sir Charles Bagot, Ambassador to Russia, to Saint Petersburg and took despatches to Naples, remaining in the Mediterranean until 1821. Marrying Mary Simson Crawford, the daughter of naval officer Captain James Coutts Crawford, in 1823, Duncan was briefly detached to Lisbon on confidential duties. He subsequently conveyed King George IV to Ireland and Calais before the ship was paid off and Duncan entered retirement. Except for occasional and largely ceremonial shore duties, Duncan did not serve in a naval capacity again. He had one surviving son, Adam Alexander and a daughter Anne Mary. A third child, Henry Robert, died at only a few days old. In December 1834, Duncan was knighted in the Royal Guelphic Order, but two years later suddenly collapsed and died at his London home in Eaton Place from apoplexy. He was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery, his funeral attended by many prominent serving naval officers. ==NotesReferences== * Category:1786 births Category:1835 deaths Category:Younger sons of viscounts Category:Royal Navy officers Category:Companions of the Order of the Bath Category:Knights Commander of the Royal Guelphic Order Category:Royal Navy personnel of the Napoleonic Wars Category:People from Belgravia Category:Burials at Kensal Green Cemetery ","title":"Henry Duncan (Royal Navy officer, born 1786)"},{"id":"20195220","text":"Duarte Pinto de Carvalho de Freitas do Amaral, GCIH, ComC KCSG; (13 May 1909 ‚Äì 16 July 1979) was a Portuguese politician. ==Background== He was the fourth of six children of Duarte do Amaral Pinto de Freitas and wife Ana Mendes Ribeiro de Oliveira, and the brother of Gaspar Pinto de Carvalho de Freitas do Amaral. ==Career== He was a Licentiate in Civil Engineering from the University of Porto.

Scored for a very large orchestra, the symphony is recognised as one of Schnittke's most extreme essays in aleatoric music: from the outset the piece is loud, brash and chaotic, and it imports motifs from all parts of the Western classical tradition. Schnittke includes a choreography for the musicians themselves, and in a manner similar to Haydn's Farewell Symphony, they leave and re-enter the stage at points marked in the score. == Music == The symphony is in four movements: The second movement opens with a faux-Baroque rondo which is soon usurped by a Mahlerian intervention on clarinet. This too is soon eclipsed by a sleazy percussive theme. There are also direct quotations from Tchaikovsky's B-minor Piano Concerto, Johann Strauss Jr's 'Vienna Woods' waltz, Chopin's Second Piano Sonata amongst many others. Often the material collides in a manner similar to Charles Ives' music, but as the critic Alex Ross notes, taken to a much greater extreme.http://www.therestisnoise.com/2004/05/schnittke_1992.html Schnittke also includes an extended jazz improvisation sequence for violin and piano in the second movement. Ross regards it as surprising that the work was ever passed by the Soviet authorities, even though by the 1970s the regime had become less hardline. Schnittke himself noted: Somehow, Ross notes, the authorities saw this as an endorsement of the Soviet regime. He argues that in this piece: The symphony was premiered on 9 February 1974, in Gorky (Nizhny Novgorod). The Gorky Philharmonic Orchestra was conducted by Gennadi Rozhdestvensky. The work was published (at least for rental) in 1978. Rozhdestvensky recorded the work in 1987 with the USSR Ministry of Culture Symphony Orchestra for Melodiya Records. A further recording with the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra under Leif Segerstam was released in 1994 on BIS Records, and Rozhdestvensky re-recorded in 1999 it with the Russian State Symphony Orchestra for Chandos Records. Schnittke's score was used by John Neumeier in his 1983 ballet Endstation Sehnsucht (A Streetcar Named Desire, based on the Tennessee Williams play of the same name). Given the resources required to perform the music, a tape recording was used instead of a live orchestra. ==Instrumentation== The symphony is scored for a large orchestra: Woodwinds : 4 flute : 4 oboes : 4 clarinets : 3 saxophones : 4 bassoons Brass : 4 horns : 4 trumpets : 4 trombones : 1 tuba Percussion : timpani : xylophone : vibraphone : marimbaphone : tubular bells : bass drum : snare drum : tom- toms : glockenspiel : tam-tam Keyboards : celesta : piano : harpsichord : organ Strings : bass guitar : 2 harps : strings ==References== Category:1974 compositions Category:Symphonies by Alfred Schnittke ","title":"Symphony No. 1 (Schnittke)"},{"id":"20195292","text":"The spotted trunkfish (Lactophrys bicaudalis) is a member of the family Ostraciidae. It can be found in reefs throughout the Caribbean, as well as the south western Atlantic Ocean. The species gets its name from the black spots it has covered over its whitish or yellow-golden body. In many Caribbean countries, it is colloquially known as box-fish, cow-fish, or shell-fish. ==Description== Members of this family are known as boxfishes because they have a hard outer covering consisting of hexagonal plate-like scales fused together into a solid, triangular or box-like carapace. The eyes, snout, fins and tail protrude from this. The spotted trunkfish is basically white or yellowish with a regular pattern of numerous black spots on the body and tailfin. Just behind the eye, adult fish have a diagonal row of three white spots where black ones would have been expected. The snout is plain white, there are no spines above the eye, and there are a pair of sharp spines in front of the anal fin. ==Distribution and habitat== The spotted trunkfish is found in the Caribbean Sea, the southern half of the Gulf of Mexico, Ascension Island, and the northeastern coast of South America as far east as Brazil. It likes clear water and is usually associated with coral reefs with fissures, holes and overhangs, at depths down to about . ==Ecology== Because of the heavy armoured scales, the spotted trunkfish is normally limited to slow movements, performed by rippling its dorsal and anal fins and gently beating its pectoral fins. If faster motion is required, it can additionally use the tail fin for propulsion. It is a benthic species, feeding on or near the seabed. Its diet includes crabs, shrimps, molluscs, sea urchins, starfish, brittle stars, sea cucumbers, tunicates and seagrasses. The spotted trunkfish, like all trunkfish of the genus Lactophrys, secretes a colourless toxin from glands on its skin when touched. The toxin is only dangerous when ingested, so there is no immediate harm to divers. Predators however, as large as nurse sharks, can die as a result of eating a trunkfish.Maurice Burton, Robert Burton. International Wildlife Encyclopedia.

He was a Hanoverian Tory, supportive of the Hanoverian Succession.Colley p.62 ==Personal life== Paget was the son of William Paget, 6th Baron Paget, and his wife Frances Pierrepont, daughter of Hon. Francis Pierrepoint She was a granddaughter of Robert Pierrepont, 1st Earl of Kingston-upon-Hull. ==Career== Paget was appointed a deputy lieutenant for Middlesex on 6 April 1689 and Staffordshire on 14 May 1689. He was elected Member of Parliament for Staffordshire on 7 November 1695 as a Tory. In 1702 he was made a deputy lieutenant for Buckinghamshire. On 30 April 1704 Paget was appointed one of the Council advising the Lord High Admiral, Prince George of Denmark, and served until the Prince's death on 28 October 1708. He was also a Lord Commissioner of the Treasury between 10 August 1710 and 30 May 1711. On 13 June 1711 he was appointed Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard, being made a Privy Counsellor the next day and being raised to the House of Lords as Baron Burton, of Burton in the County of Stafford, on 1 January 1712. On 26 February 1713 he succeeded his father as 7th Baron Paget of Beaudesert, and was also appointed to succeed him as Lord Lieutenant of Staffordshire. On 1 May 1714 he was appointed Envoy Extraordinary to the Elector of Hanover, but refused to go unless he was made an Earl, which Queen Anne refused. However, when the Elector succeeded as King George I of Great Britain on 1 August, he raised Paget in the peerage as Earl of Uxbridge in the County of Middlesex, on 19 October 1714, and appointed him to the new Privy Council, 16 November 1714. In 1727, the Town of Uxbridge, Massachusetts Colony, was named in honour of Henry Paget, First Earl of Uxbridge. ===Later life=== In 1715 Lord Uxbridge ceased to be Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard and Lord Lieutenant, and took on the post of Recorder of Lichfield, in which he served until his death. In 1740, he became a justice of the peace for Cambridgeshire. ==Personal life== In 1686, he married Mary Catesby, the eldest daughter and co-heiress of Thomas Catesby of Whiston and Ecton and Margaret Samwell (a daughter of Richard Samwell of Upton). Together, they were the parents of: * Thomas Catesby Paget, styled Lord Paget, who married Lady Elizabeth Egerton, youngest daughter of John Egerton, 3rd Earl of Bridgewater and Lady Jane Paulet (a daughter of Charles Paulet, 1st Duke of Bolton). * Lady Mary Paget, who married Stephen Metcalfe. Lady Uxbridge died suddenly on 3 November 1734, and was buried at West Drayton on 9 November. On 7 June 1739 Lord Uxbridge remarried to Elizabeth Bagot (b. 1674). She was a member of another Staffordshire county family, the daughter of the late Sir Walter Bagot, 3rd Baronet (to whose Parliamentary seat Uxbridge had succeeded in 1695). He was seventy-six and she was sixty-nine. The Earl of Uxbridge died at West Drayton on 30 August 1743, aged eighty. As his son Thomas, Lord Paget had predeceased him, on 4 February 1742, he was succeeded in his titles by his grandson Henry, who became the 2nd Earl.

He is a former French youth and under-21 international, but in 2012 he accepted a call up from Senegal for the Olympic games tournament, eligible due to his Senegalese parentage. Gueye started his professional career with RC Strasbourg in France, before moving to Everton in 2010. He made 24 appearances for Everton in four seasons, spending time on loan at Brest, before leaving the club and joining Millwall in 2014. He was a talented sprinter but stopped to focus on his football career. His 100m personal best remains 10.13s. ==Club careerStrasbourg=== Gueye was born in Nogent-sur-Marne to Senegalese parents and began his career in the √éle-de-France region playing for local club US Lognes in the eastern suburbs of Paris. In 2002, at the age of 12, he joined the youth academy of RC Strasbourg. Gueye quickly progressed through the youth ranks, where he helped the under-18 squad reach the semi-finals of the 2008 Coupe Gambardella. For the 2008‚Äì09 season, he was promoted to the club's Championnat de France amateur team, appearing in 13 matches and scoring two goals. He also assisted on three goals. On 30 October, Gueye signed his first professional contract, agreeing to a three-year deal until June 2012. He was officially promoted to the senior team and assigned the number 4 shirt. Gueye made his professional debut on 3 November 2008 in the club's league match against Lens appearing as a substitute for the Brazilian Marcos in a 1‚Äì1 draw. He made his first career start several months later on 10 April 2009, this time in a 4‚Äì1 defeat to Lens. Gueye switched to the number 8 shirt for the 2009‚Äì10 season and scored his first professional goal in the club's first match of the season against Istres in the Coupe de la Ligue. However, Strasbourg lost the match 6‚Äì1. He continued his streak of proficient goalscoring by scoring a goal in each of the club's first five league matches against Ch√¢teauroux, Laval, Arles-Avignon, Ajaccio, and Sedan. Gueye later suffered a severe groin injury and missed both November and December. Following the winter break, he returned to the team and in his first match back, he provided the assist for Strasbourg's only goal in their 3‚Äì1 loss to Olympique Lyonnais in the Coupe de France. However, later in the match, Gueye suffered an injury to his knee. The injury was, initially, diagnosed as torn ligaments, however, after further medical analysis, it was reduced to only a sprain. Gueye missed six weeks, as opposed to six months had he torn the ligaments. ===Everton=== In June 2010, Gueye joined English club Everton, signing a five-year contract, for a fee of ¬£1m. He made his d√©but in a 1‚Äì0 victory over Sydney FC on a pre-season tour of Australia the following month. Gueye scored his first goal for the club in a 2‚Äì1 victory over Brisbane Roar a week later. He made his competitive d√©but for the Blues in their first League Cup match of the 2010‚Äì11 season, starting on the field in a 5‚Äì1 victory over Huddersfield Town. His first league appearance for Everton came on 2 April 2011, as a substitute for S√©amus Coleman in a 2‚Äì2 draw against Aston Villa. His first Premier League start was in a 3‚Äì0 win against Wolves on 9 April 2011. Gueye was influential in Everton's FA Cup quarter-final replay victory at Sunderland on 27 March 2012, assisting Nikica Jelavic for Everton's first of the game and securing the club's third appearance at Wembley Stadium in as many years. On 9 April 2012, Gueye's first Premier League goal came in a 4‚Äì0 win over Sunderland, smashing in the opener from a rebound from a Leon Osman effort. He also made two assists in the match. He scored his only goal of the 2012‚Äì13 season on 29 August 2012, volleying in a S√©amus Coleman cross in a League Cup second round tie at home to Leyton Orient. On 13 June 2014, Gueye left the club by mutual consent. ===Stade Brestois 29=== In January 2013, Gueye joined French club Brest on loan for the rest of the 2012‚Äì13 season. He made his debut on 9 February 2013 against Valenciennes but could not prevent a 2‚Äì1 loss for Brest. Gueye made a total of eight appearances for the club. ===Millwall=== Gueye joined Millwall on 25 July 2014 on a one-year contract with an option for a further 12 months. He scored his first goal for the Lions against Sheffield Wednesday, denying the hosts victory in the 94th minute. Gueye left the club in July 2015 after his contract wasn't renewed. ===Qarabaƒü=== On 17 July 2019, Gueye signed a two-year contract with Qarabaƒü FK. July On 6 August 2019, Gueye scored his first goal for Qarabaƒü FK against APOEL at third qualifying round of 2019‚Äì20 UEFA Champions League. August On 8 June 2020, Qarabaƒü announced that Gueye had left the club by mutual consent. ==International careerFrance=== Gueye featured with the under-16 team early on during his development, but appeared with neither the under-17s nor the under-18s in competition. He returned with the under-19 team making his debut in an under-19 tournament held in Denmark. He participated with the team in the qualification for the 2009 UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship scoring goals against Malta and Latvia. In the tournament, he scored the team's only goal in their 3‚Äì1 loss to England in the semi-finals.

Ernst P√∂ppel (born 29 April 1940) is a German psychologist and neuroscientist P√∂ppel was born in Schwessin, Farther Pomerania. He has studied psychology and biology in Freiburg and Munich, Germany, before finishing his academic education with PhD in 1968 in Innsbruck, Austria. He did research on temporal perception and circadian rhythms between 1964 and 1968 in the Max- Planck-Institute of Behavioral Physiology, and on neurophysiology of vision in 1969 and 1970 in Max-Planck-Institute of Psychiatry, Munich. From 1971 to 1973, he did research on neuropsychology of vision at the Department of Psychology and Brain Science at MIT, Cambridge, USA. At the same time, he was staff scientist at the Neuroscience Research Program (NRP). At this time, he described together with Richard Held and Douglas Frost a phenomenon of residual vision,P√∂ppel E, Held R, Frost D, Letter: Residual visual function after brain wounds involving the central visual pathways in man. Nature, 1973, 243(5405): 295-296. which became known as blindsight. He is the father of Dr. David Poeppel. After his first habilitation in Sensory Physiology (Dr. med. habil.) in 1974 and a second one in Psychology (Dr. phil. habil.) in 1976 he became Professor of Medical Psychology (‚ÄúOrdinarius‚Äù) in 1976 at the Medical Faculty of Munich University, Germany. In 1977 he founded the Institute for Medical Psychology, and he became its director, a position he held until 2008. From 1992 to 1997 he had leave of absence from Munich University, when he was board member of the national Research Center Juelich, where he was responsible for the Life Sciences (Brain Research, Biotechnology), Environmental Sciences, and Mathematical Modeling. In 1997, he and the neuroscientist Gerhard Neuweiler founded the Humanwissenschaftliches Zentrum (HWZ ‚Äì Human Science Center) of Munich University, and he has been the CEO since then. The HWZ is an interdisciplinary and international platform for research to bridge the gap between academic faculties. With its more than 70 members worldwide, research of the HWZ focuses on ‚Äúanthropological universals and cultural specifics‚Äù. In 1999, for instance, the HWZ started a sequence of Sino-German Workshops together with Peking University. The 7th Sino-German Workshop in 2008 was dedicated to the topic of ‚ÄúCulture and Identity‚Äù, which was coorganized with Shihui Han from the Department of Psychology of Beida (Peking University). Since 2000 Ernst P√∂ppel is also Co-Director of Parmenides Center for the Study of Thinking (Elba, Italy, and Munich), since 2001 he is Scientific Director of the Generation Research Program (GRP) in Bad T√∂lz, Germany, and since 2006 he is Co-Director of the FESTO Program of Applied Knowing (F.PAK). The GRP is dedicated to research for the elderly taking into consideration of demographic changes; F.PAK develops a new Master Program for vocational learning based on results from the neurosciences and systems theory. Ernst P√∂ppel has received several honors, like the Bavaria Constitutional Medal, and in 1992 he became Member of Leopoldina (ML), the National Scientific Academy of Germany. He is also member of the European Academy of Sciences and Arts, and has been Dean of Science.

He has always tried to bring scientific knowledge to general public through books, articles for non- academic audience and a TV series on ‚ÄúMagic Universe of the Brain‚Äù. In parallel to his research in vision and temporal perception, he has promoted the cooperation between scientists and artists, a field has become known lately as ‚ÄúNeuro-Esthetics‚Äù. Together with the American poet Fred Turner he received an award of the American Poetry Association for an essay on the temporal structure in poems. He works closely together with the Austrian poet Raoul Schrott, and the Russian-German artist Igor Sacharow-Ross, who took up his concept of ‚ÄúSyntopy‚Äù. With this new term, which is juxtaposed to ‚ÄúUtopy‚Äù the need of bringing together at one place different activities in modern society is expressed. In particular, in cooperation with scholars from Japan (like Hiroshi Shimizu or Tadeshe Kume) this new term and concept has proven to be useful. Research of Ernst P√∂ppel has globalized in the last years, having moved now more towards the East compared to earlier orientation towards the West, like cooperation with scientists from the US. He has common projects with Chinese colleagues from Peking University (in particular with Yan Bao and Bin Zhou from the Department of Psychology and with Huisheng Chi and Xihong Wu from the Center of Speech and Hearing Research)Bao Y, P√∂ppel E, Two spatially separated attention systems in the visual field: evidence from inhibition of return.

During his career, Lambert served in numerous ships and several military actions with success, participating in the capture of √éle Bonaparte in the Indian Ocean as second in command under Josias Rowley. Lambert is best known however for being captain of the frigate HMS Java on 29 December 1812 when she was captured in the Mid-Atlantic by USS Constitution during the War of 1812. Lambert was mortally wounded in the battle and died seven days later in Salvador, Brazil. ==Career== Lambert was the son of naval Captain Robert Lambert and entered the navy at an early age aboard HMS Cumberland in 1795. Serving in the Mediterranean, Cumberland was heavily engaged at the Battle of Hy√®res where the French ship of the line Alcide was blown up. For the next six years, Lambert served in the Mediterranean on board the frigate HMS Virginie and the ship of the line HMS Suffolk before obtaining promotion to lieutenant in 1801. He later joined HMS Victorious and the following year HMS Centurion during the Peace of Amiens.Lambert, Henry, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, J. K. Laughton, (subscription required), Retrieved 15 November 2008 At the outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars in 1803, Lambert was promoted to be commander of the 20-gun . In April 1804 he fought off the 36-gun French privateer Psych√© on the East India Station. The following year he became a post captain in command of the 44-gun frigate HMS San Fiorenzo. As captain of San Fiorenzo, in February 1805 he encountered the Psych√© again, now a frigate of the French Navy. This time Lambert captured her. He then sailed San Fiorenzo back to Britain in June. In 1808 Lambert took command of the frigate HMS Iphigenia, initially based at Quebec, but later transferring back to the Indian Ocean where he had previously been successful. Attached to the squadron then besieging √éle Bonaparte and √éle de France under Josias Rowley, in July 1810 Lambert participated in the successful invasion of √éle Bonaparte. The following month, Lambert was part of a frigate squadron led by Samuel Pym which attempted to raid the anchorage of Grand Port on √éle de France. Due to poor charts of the numerous reefs within the harbour, the attack was a disaster, with two frigates destroyed and two more, including Iphigenia severely damaged and captured. Lambert and his crew were released from captivity following the successful invasion of √éle de France and honourably acquitted in the court martial inquiring into the loss of their ship, which had also been recaptured. In 1812, Lambert was given command of HMS Java, originally a French frigate captured during the Mauritius campaign. On 29 December, Java engaged the larger American frigate USS Constitution which captured Java in a bitter battle, Lambert opting to engage the American ship rather than flee in the hope of inflicting such damage that Constitution would be forced to retire to the US for repairs. In the event, Java was captured and destroyed and Lambert mortally wounded by a musket ball in the chest. Despite the efforts of the American surgeon aboard Constitution, Lambert died on 4 January 1813 in Salvador, Brazil from the effects of his wounds and was buried the following day. ==Literature== Henry Lambert is a character in the Fortune of War, which is the sixth novel in Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey‚ÄìMaturin series. In the book, he is mortally wounded in combat aboard HMS Java, just as in real life. He was also named in the fourth novel, The Mauritius Command, as captain of the Iphigenia, as in real life. Oddly, when Aubrey meets him in the Fortune of War there is no reference to their service together two years earlier. ==Family== He was the son of Captain Robert Lambert RN, younger brother of Rear Admiral Robert Lambert RN, General Sir John Lambert, Major General Samuel Lambert and older brother of Admiral Sir George Lambert RN.http://www.napoleon- series.org/research/biographies/BritishGenerals/c_Britishgenerals92.html ==NotesReferences== * * Category:1813 deaths Category:Royal Navy officers Category:British military personnel killed in the War of 1812 Category:Royal Navy personnel of the French Revolutionary Wars Category:Royal Navy personnel of the Napoleonic Wars Category:Year of birth unknown ","title":"Henry Lambert"},{"id":"20195462","text":"Serghei Covaliov (14 October 1944 ‚Äì 16 May 2011) was a Romanian sprint canoeist.

Ward was into several industries in Michigan and the Midwest. He accumulated timberlands and lands that contained iron ore, copper and silver. He branched into several industries including newspapers, railroads, glass manufacturing, banking, steamships, and insurance companies.Woodford, p. 80 He even was one of the promoters of the Soo Locks of which he was one of the first to use, as at first he hauled schooners overland around the Soo Rapids to sail Lake Superior.Catlin, p. 497 == Biography  Early life === Roman Catholic Cathedral reconstructed of stone in Detroit 1821 after 1805 fire burned old church Ward was born in Applegaths Mills, Waterloo County, in the Canadian province of Ontario, on December 25, 1811. He was one of four children. The eldest was Emily, who remained a spinster until her death, Sallie the second, Eber Brock the third, and Abbie the fourth. Ward was an American citizen. His parents had grown up in Vermont and soon after they were married they moved to Onondaga County, New York shortly before Ward's birth. Shortly thereafter they moved to Waterloo County, Ontario, not far from York (modern Toronto), unsuccessfully trying to avoid the pending War of 1812 in the United States.Leake, p. 1234Detroit News - E. B. Ward obituary January 2, 1875, published by The New York Times January 5, 1875. Ward's parents moved back to Vermont and their old homestead and stayed there for the next five years until he was about six years old.Tuttle, p. 157 The town they lived in was Wells, Vermont, near the city of Rutland. In 1817 his parents started a move to Kentucky with the family.Tuttle, p. 158 While they were in Waterford, Pennsylvania his mother fell ill and died. His father with the family then changed his plans of moving to Kentucky and went to Ohio instead. Once in Ohio for only a short time his father decided to move to Detroit, which they reached by 1821 when Ward was nine to ten years old.Page, pp. 50, 51 Detroit had been destroyed some sixteen years earlier and what Ward saw was a small town of 1,400 but the capital of the Michigan territory. === Shipping === Ward obtained a job as a cabin boy and deck hand on the Great Lakes when he was twelve or thirteen years old at Marine City, Michigan. This was on vessels that traveled to Mackinaw City and back. There were no vessels owned by any shippers in Detroit in the early 1820s. Samuel Ward, his uncle, was the leading shipbuilder of Marine City at the time. He noticed young Ward's high energy and enthusiasm for life and gave him a job in 1830 as a clerk in one of the warehouses of his shipbuilding firm. Ward came in contact with marine transactions this way and learned the industry. Ward worked hard and saved every amount of money he could. Eventually he invested in a vessel called the General Harrison as a twenty-five percent owner. He became the Master of this vessel in 1835. He was successful as its operator but eventually became a partner with his uncle at Marine City. He was successful at this interprise and continued this until 1850 when he moved to Detroit. There he was involved in the ship building business and among the many steamers and sailing ships he built were the Artic, Atlantic, B. F. Wade, Detroit, General Harrison, Huron, Montgomery, Ocean, Pacific, Planet, Samuel Ward, The Caspian, The Champion, and The Pearl. Woodford, p. 79 With his uncle he built a fleet of thirty steamships that transported supplies to various towns and cities around the Great Lakes. In the mid-nineteenth century they were the largest shipowners on the Great Lakes.Lamar, p. 464 === Railroading === Starting around 1852 Ward acquired timber lands along the Pere Marquette River in Lake County, Michigan near the Ludington area. He held onto these lands until the timber had matured more. Ward was elected president of the Flint and Pere Marquette Railroad Company in 1860. Ward was the first to build rail tracks made out of Bessemer steel.Encyclopedia of Chicago - Iron and Steel === Mining === Ward's last venture was silver mining. He bought into a fourteen-acre island with other investors off the north shore of Lake Superior at Thunder Bay in 1870 containing the Silver Islet Mining Company. It turned out to contain a seventy-foot vein of high quality silver. The silver was so rich that in the first three weeks of mining Ward's mine extracted $100,000 worth of silver - which was more money than the Nevada Comstock Lode mine made per day. === Logging === Ward carried on logging operations in Lake County through his agents and in the 1869 purchased a tract of land which consisting of 70,000 acres in the Fourth Ward of Ludington on Lake Pere Marquette which was accessible by the Pere Marquette River. He then made plans to extend his railroad to Ludington to operate mills there, however James Ludington stalled the negotiations to purchase mills in the Ludington area because he feared Ward would become too big and dominate the lumber industry in the area. Mr. Ludington favored the extending of the rail line to Ludington, however since he owned most of the sawmills in the area, he refused to sell any of them to Ward for any price. He was hoping then that since Ward would not have a sawmill in the area that he would be forced to sell some of his timer lands at a very economical depressed price. Ward never did sell off any of his timber lands of the area due to Mr. Ludington's actions.Cabot, p. 16 Ward had heard in Detroit, where his businesses were, that Mr. Ludington had cut down timber in his 70,000 acres he owned in Northern Michigan near the town of Ludington. He did nothing about it at the time. Eventually Mr. Ludington came to Detroit to do business. Ward had Mr. Ludington arrested for stealing his valuable timber. Mr. Ludington was thrown into the Wayne County jail. Ward then got a judgement against him for $650,000 for the theft and trespassing. Mr. Ludington then suffered a stroke. Eventually the company once owned by Mr. Ludington, the Pere Marquette Lumber Company, settled it with Ward in August 1869 with an amicable agreement.Cabot, p. 17 Ward built a sawmill out on Lake Pere Marquette in 1870 known as the \\"North\\" mill. It was built on fifty-five stone piers and was 50 feet by 130 feet in size. It was equipped with two circular mills and cutting-edge technology. The cost of the mill was $60,000 and it had the capacity of 100,000 board feet per day. Ward purchased all the land between his mill and that of Messrs. Danaher and Melendy, which bordered on the Lake in the spring of 1871. During the summer months he built a warehouse that was 50 feet by 120 feet near his original mill. This was used for storing supplies and selling supplies to his employees. The next year Ward built another mill nearby which was called the \\"South\\" mill. This mill was considered the best sawmill in the United States. === Steel manufacturing === Eureka Iron & Steel Works 1860 Ward organized Eureka Iron & Steel Works in 1853 with a group of investors and they purchased \\"The Wyandotte\\" farm from John Biddle for $44,000 and built an iron and steel manufacturing factory. The site of this company located in Wyandotte, Michigan, was . The factory was at an ideal location for the steel industry as iron ore from the Upper Peninsula and limestone from other parts of Michigan could easily be brought in economically through the Great Lakes down to Wyandotte through Lake Huron and up the Detroit River. Extensive beech forests were nearby to supply the charcoal needed to make steel. The Eureka furnace in 1864, with its huge steel making smelting apparatus, made the first commercial steel produced in the United States by the Bessemer process.Woodford, p. 80 It was in the Eureka furnace in 1864 that the first commercial steel was produced in the United States by the Bessemer process. The first successful American experiments of making steel using the Bessemer conversion process in a furnace was through the Eureka Works company that Ward owned. Ward took great interest in the first experiments of the apparatus for the Bessemer process of making steel. The patent to the Bessemer process was granted in England in 1856 and in the United States in 1857 to William Kelly. In 1861 Ward and Zoheth S. Durfee of New Bedford, Massachusetts, obtained control of the patents of William Kelly, credited in Europe to Henry Bessemer. Kelly had previously successfully experimented with the pneumatic process at Eddyville, Kentucky, where he owned the Eddyville Iron Works, however went into bankruptcy caused by the panic of 1857. To pay off his debts he sold his rights to Ward and his investors. In 1861 Zoheth S. Durfee went to Europe to study the Bessemer process and to obtain the Bessemer patent rights. During his absence Ward invited William F. Durfee, a cousin of Z. S. Durfee and also of New Bedford, to erect an experimental blast furnace apparatus at Wyandotte, Michigan, for the manufacture of pneumatic steel using the Bessemer process. This experimenting took place in the latter half of 1862. In May 1863 the Kelly Pneumatic Process Company was organized by Ward with other investors with Kelly being one of the beneficiaries of profits made using the Bessemer process of making steel since he was the original patent holder. Kelly received thirty percent of the stock of the Kelly Pneumatic Process Company and Ward with his investors received the remainder seventy percent.William Kelly Biography To make the steel legally it was decided to acquire the Bessemer patent rights. Zoheth S. Durfee went to England to acquire the patent rights to the Bessemer process. He was unsuccessful at this but did observe several European steelmakers and managed to get the rights to Englishman Robert Mushet's patent use of spiegeleisen (manganese-rich pig iron) for better overall quality of steel produced this way. Meanwhile, William F. Durfee (engineer and architect), Robert Mushet, Thomas Clare and John Brown were brought in by Ward to make the procedure necessary to produce Bessemer steel, especially using spiegeleisen.Fricke, p. 221 He succeeded in making Bessemer steel at the experimental works of the Kelly Pneumatic Process Company owned by Ward and his investors.Sauveur, pp. 134-38 The first Bessemer steel made in the United States was at this factory in 1865. In Henry Bessemer's autobiography he writes that the Bessemer process was first experimentally practised in the United States with a 3-ton converter, at the ironworks of Mr. E. B. Ward, at Wyandotte, near Detroit.Bessemer, chapter 21, \\"The Bessemer process was first experimentally practised in this country with a 3-ton converter, at the ironworks of Mr. E. B. Ward, at Wyandotte, near Detroit, under the superintendence of Mr. L. M. Hart, who had learned the Bessemer process at the works of Messrs. Jackson, in France...\\" Ward's Kelly Pneumatic Process Company merged with interests of a Bessemer factory of Troy, New York since an engineer there had acquired initially the Bessemer process rights for the United States. In 1866 the new formed company was called the Pneumatic Steel Association. The new formed company then licensed franchises to prospective Bessemer steelmakers who paid royalties to use the patented process for every ton of steel they made.Hillstrom, p. 77 Ward created steel rails beginning in 1865 for his railroads using the Bessemer process. Detroit soon became a major center of steel production, especially for use in home heating stoves. Henry Ford of nearby Dearborn took advantage of this technology. With its capabilities to create large amounts of steel for his automobile assembly lines Ford produced his cars. Eureka Iron Works prospered through the late 19th century, but suffered a shortage of raw materials. It closed in 1892. Ward meanwhile had built another steelmill in Chicago called the Illinois Steel Company. From this steelmill in 1865 Ward made the first Bessemer steel rails produced in the United States.Catlin, p. 498 === Family === Clara Ward, daughter of subject Ward married twice. His first wife was Maryell 1860 United States Federal Census, Detroit Ward 9, Wayne, Michigan and his second wife was Catherine.1870 United States Federal Census, Detroit Ward 9, Wayne, Michigan He married Mary Margaret McQueen on July 24, 1837. United States Federal Census 1850 shows his marriage to Mary (age 34) as having two children, Elizabeth (age 4) and Milton (age 2). There was also a son Henry (age 8), location then unknown. The Wards lived at 807 Fort Street in Detroit. United States Census 1860 shows his children then to be Henry (age 18), Elizabeth (age 13), Milton (age 12), Charles (age 10), Frederick (age 8), Mary (age 5). Ward's wife (Maryell) divorced him in 1869 after six children on grounds of adultery. Two months later he married Catherine Lyon, Ohio Senator Benjamin Wade's niece. They had two children, Eber Jr. (b. 1870) and Clara (b. 1873) - a.k.a. Princesse de Caraman-Chimay. Ward's children by both of his wives had many personal problems. Charles, Ward's fourth child and third son by his first wife Mary, was considered \\"deranged and eccentric\\" and went bankrupt. Ward's first-born child by his first wife was his son Henry, insane from 15, was committed to the Michigan State Hospital and was not recorded in the 1850 census where the Wards was living, even though he was their first child. Frederick, Ward's fourth son, committed suicide. Elizabeth was considered as mentally incompetent. His youngest child by his first wife, Mary E. Ward, was considered \\"eccentric.\\" Ward's two children by his second wife also had problems. Clara married Marie Joseph Anatole Pierre Alphonse de Riquet, Prince de Caraman-Chimay in 1890 and became Princesse de Caraman-Chimay, officially a genuine European princess. She, however, later run off with a Hungarian gypsy and left her husband, causing quite a scandal. Eber Jr.‚Äôs wife, Victorine, divorced him in 1900. She said he was too much captivated with his stepdaughter, her daughter from a previous marriage, Blanche Herault. === Death === Ward's Detroit home on W. Fort St Ward died January 2, 1875 of a stroke.Eber Brock Ward, Midwest captain of industry At the time of his death he was a multi-millionaire. He owned about two million dollars' worth of real estate and about $500,000 in a shipping fleet.Tuttle, p. 159 Additionally he owned about a million dollars worth' of stock in the Chicago Rolling Mill company and about half a million dollars' worth of stock of the Milwaukee Rolling Mill company which contributed much to his wealth. He also had about a half a million in the Wyandotte Rolling Mill. At the time of his death it was uncertain what he was worth. Ward's immense wealth and business interests were so large at the time of his death that it is said that hardly any town of any importance in the Midwest was not affected by his death. His capital was so large and vast that it took several different accountings to figure it out. His businesses extended through several States reaching from Michigan to the Gulf of Mexico. His businesses were chiefly invested in iron, silver and copper mines, pine lands, sawmills, in rolling mills, silver smelting works, railroads, farming lands, and glass works. Ward was nominally the wealthiest man in the whole Midwest at the time of his death. His capital was estimated anywhere from about $7,000,000 to about $22,000.000. Realistically about $10,000,000 was all that was obtained from his estate when it was ultimately cashed out. It was not enough to cover all the liabilities Ward entailed.Western Historical Company, p. 310 At the time of his death he left five adult children by his first wife and two children (a boy, 5 years old, and a girl, 2 years old) by his second wife. He wrote up a last will and testament six months prior to his death. He last lived at West Fort Street and 19th Ave in Detroit. Ward is buried in Elmwood Cemetery.Elmwood Cemetery - E.B.

The song is a first person narration by a homeless drifter who laments his lonely, rootless existence but at the same time celebrates \\"living off the side of our great land...\\" as he defiantly proclaims, \\"Things I learned in a hobo jungle are things they never taught me in a classroom.\\" Aside from the jaunty \\"I'm Bringing Home Good News,\\" the album is largely a stripped down affair with arrangements and instrumentation that reveal a pop and folk music influence, such as on the title track. Pride in What I Am also showcases Haggard's affection for the blues on the comically self-loathing \\"I Can't Hold Myself In Line\\" and the Jimmie Rodgers classic \\"California Blues (Blue Yodel #4)\\" (Haggard's next studio album would be a tribute to Rodgers, released three months after this one). Haggard was beginning to attract attention from artists outside the country field, such as crooner Dean Martin, who recorded \\"I Take a Lot of Pride in What I Am\\" for his album of the same name in 1969. In addition, the Gram Parsons incarnation of the Byrds had performed \\"Sing Me Back Home\\" on the Grand Ole Opry and had recorded Haggard's \\"Life in Prison\\" for their album Sweetheart of the Rodeo the same year. Part of Haggard's strong appeal during this period was the high quality and of his albums in an industry that saw the LP as a dumping ground for leftover studio cuts and a cash cow for music publishing companies. As Daniel Cooper notes in his essay for the 1994 retrospective Down Every Road, \\"...at a time when country albums were notorious for consisting of two or three hit singles and a load of filler, Haggard, in the same amount of studio time, would produce LPs consisting of two or three #1 smashes and a series of album tracks any one of which would have been someone else's career record.\\" ==Reception== Pride In What I Am peaked at number 11 on the Billboard country albums chart and remains a critical favorite. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic states that the collection \\"gains considerable strength from a diversity of material, where the rolling, folk-tinged sound epitomized by the title song is balanced by twangy, spare country and bits of hard honky tonk, blues...\\" In the book Merle Haggard: The Running Kind, David Cantwell calls it \\"an album that stands with Haggard's best,\\" calling \\"The Day the Rains Came\\" \\"wondrous, weird, and lovely.\\" ==Reissues== In 2002, Pride in What I Am was reissued by BGO Records along with The Legend of Bonnie and Clyde.[ Allmusic entry for The Legend of Bonnie and Clyde/Pride in What I Am reissue.] In 2006, Pride in What I Am was reissued by Capitol Nashville along with Mama Tried with five bonus tracks and 24-bit digital remastering.[ Allmusic entry for Mama Tried/Pride in What I Am reissue.] ==Track listing== All songs by Merle Haggard unless otherwise noted. #\\"I Take a Lot of Pride in What I Am\\" #\\"Who'll Buy the Wine\\" (Billy Mize) #\\"The Day the Rains Came\\" #\\"It Meant Goodbye to Me (When You Said Hello to Him)\\" (Lefty Frizzell, Abe Mulkey) #\\"I Can't Hold Myself in Line\\" #\\"I'm Bringin' Home Good News\\" #\\"Keep Me from Cryin' Today\\" #\\"I Just Want to Look at You One More Time\\" #\\"Somewhere on Skid Row\\" (Red Simpson) #\\"I'm Free\\" (Leon Copeland) #\\"California Blues (Blue Yodel No. 4)\\" (Jimmie Rodgers) #\\"I Think We're Livin' in the Good Old Days\\" (Dean Holloway, Red Simpson) ==Personnel== *Merle Haggard‚Äì vocals, guitar The Strangers: *Roy Nichols ‚Äì guitar, harmonica *Norman Hamlet ‚Äì steel guitar *George French ‚Äì piano *Jerry Ward ‚Äì bass *Eddie Burris ‚Äì drums with *Lewis Talley ‚Äì guitar *Bonnie Owens ‚Äì harmony vocals and *James Burton ‚Äì guitar *Bob Morris ‚Äì bass *Leon Copeland ‚Äì bass *Roy Huskey, Jr. - bass ==Chart positions== {  !Chart (1969) !Peak position - Billboard Country albums 11 - Billboard Pop albums 189 - } ==References== Category:1969 albums Category:Merle Haggard albums Category:Capitol Records albums Category:Albums produced by Ken Nelson (United States record producer) ","title":"Pride in What I Am"},{"id":"20195513","text":"Bilateral relations between Russia and Thailand date to the late nineteenth century, when the Russian Tsar Nicholas II and King Chulalongkorn (Rama V) of Siam (as Thailand was then known) formed a friendly personal relationship. The two countries exchanged legations in 1897‚Äì1898, and signed a Treaty of Friendship and Maritime Navigation in 1899. Diplomatic relations were terminated following the Russian Revolution in 1917, and re-established between the Soviet Union and Thailand on March 12, 1941; Thailand recognized Russian Federation as the successor to Soviet Union on December 28, 1991. Russia has an embassy in Bangkok and two honorary consulates in Phuket and Pattaya. Thailand has an embassy in Moscow and two honorary consulates (in Saint Petersburg and Vladivostok). Both countries are full members of APEC and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (Russia is a participating state and Thailand is a partner). The first recorded contact between Russians and Siam was on 19 February 1863, when the ships Gaydamak and Novik arrived at Bangkok. Close relations between Thailand's aristocratic families and the Russian Empire ensued, with a well-documented friendship between Chulalongkorn and Nikolas II. Chakrabongse Bhuvanath, the 40th child of Chulalongkorn, was later to marry Ekaterina Desnitskaya, whom he met while studying in the Russian Empire. ==Economic tiesBilateral trade=== Official figures of trade volume published by two countries contradict each other. * According to Thai sources, trade with Russia in 2008 reached 2.11 billion US dollars; Thailand has a trade deficit of 1.76 billion US dollars. Russia exports mineral resources, while Thailand exports auto parts, electronics and foodstuffs. * According to Russian customs service, Russian exports to Thailand in 2008 amounted to 1.23 billion, imports to 1.49 billion, leaving Russia with a deficit of 254 million US dollars. In total, trade with Thailand is only 0.4% of Russian foreign trade. According to Russian embassy in Bangkok, Thailand is Russia's largest trading partner in South-eastern Asia and third largest buyer of Russian ferrous metals worldwide. As recently as in 2002, Russia had a significant trade deficit and imported significant (up to half a million metric tons p.a.) amounts of Thai rice. In 2005 Russia imposed prohibitive protectionist tariffs on rice, then an embargo on Thai rice and a full ban on imports of Thai rice in 2007, citing pest infection. In 2004 Thailand approached Russian authorities about the prospects of buying 12 Su-30 jet fighters. Thai chicken industry, weakened by avian influenza crisis, enthusiastically backed the deal, betting on reciprocal easing of Russian food import regime, but the deal never materialized. In October 2008 Thai Prime Minister Somchai Wongsawat agreed to purchase Russian Mi-17 military helicopters, breaking with dependence on American weapons, however his government was ousted two months later. ===Tourism=== Thailand is one of the major tropical destinations for tourists from Russia. However, numbers provided by the Thai authorities are contested by Russians as artificially inflated, and Thai authorities contest that Russian numbers are too small: * Russian border guards reported 259,000 departures to Thailand in 2008 (235,000 in 2007). Turkey, the most common destination, accounts for 2.2 million departures. Thai government sources noted that the Russian number includes only direct flights, leaving out tourists that fly with stopovers elsewhere and reported 279,000 Russian tourists for 2007. * Thai tourist service reported 456,972 Russian \\"tourist visits\\" to Pattaya alone in January‚ÄìMarch 2007 (of a total of 1.57 million). Russian commentators note that Thais actually counted hotel nights and their number should be divided by a factor of 10 to 11. In 2018, it is estimated that 1.5 million Russians visited Thailand, a 15% increase from 2017. On average, about 20,000 Thais visit Russia per year. ==See also== *Foreign relations of Russia *Foreign relations of Thailand ==References * Documents on the Russia‚ÄìThailand relationship at the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs *St. Petersburg's Man in Siam: A.E.

He became a garde-marine at Brest aged 13 in 1727. Rising to ensign (1731), he navigated the Baltic Sea to Saint Domingue and was made lieutenant de vaisseau in 1741 then Capitaine de Vaisseau and knight of the ordre de Saint Louis on 1 January 1746, at only 32 years old, for noteworthy service over the last 19 years. He commanded the \\"Aquilon\\" for 15 months in the Antilles in 1750 and 1751. Having the frigate of Duchaffault under his orders and accompanied by a British frigate, he skilfully fulfilled a delicate mission for which he was praised many times by the Rouill√© ministry. This allowed him to actively collaborate with vicomte S√©bastien-Fran√ßois Bigot de Morogues, commander of Brest, in the foundation of Brest's acad√©mie de Marine in 1752, of which he and his younger brother were two of the first members, but which was decimated by the town's losses between 1756 and 1763. Between 1754 and 1758, Roquefeuil acted as second in command of a squadron in the Antilles, under La Galissonni√®re, P√©rier then Bompart. Promoted to chef d'escadre des Arm√©es navales on 1 January 1761, at only 47 years old, and received the command of the ships and port at Brest, to which the king added command of Brest's town and castle and the Isle of Ushant on 25 March 1762 (three positions his father had already held). In a brief presentation the navy minister wrote to the king about Roquefeuil, who approved in his own hand \\"He has served for nearly 40 years in the Navy, on 16 campaigns, has held 4 commands at sea and has for 5 years commanded the Port of Brest to the satisfaction of His Majesty\\". Aged 52, he was on 3 August 1766 made lieutenant general, retaining his Brest commands, where he and the minister Duc de Praslin were allowed to promote the new \\"Acad√©mie royale de marine\\", under royal patronage, in April 1769 ‚Äì Roquefeuil became its first director. He was promoted to vice-amiral on 6 April 1781 as well as Grand Croix of the Ordre royal et militaire de Saint-Louis. ==Assessment== He was a stubborn moderniser, a peerless organizer and a highly experimented sailor who left a deep imprint on the navy, the Brest fleet and the port and town of Brest during his 20 years in command of them (1761‚Äì81) then the two years he served as vice-amiral from 1781 until his death. Under his command, budgets were obtained from the king and his ministers and several powerful well-equipped ships were planned, launched and fitted out. These made up the remarkable \\"Fleet of Louis XVI\\", probably the most coherent one France had ever possessed. Little known by the public, he is considered by naval historians as one of the main men behind the organization and realization of Louis XV and Louis XVI's naval policy which allowed French and American allies to beat Great Britain in the American Revolutionary War. ==References== Category:1714 births Category:1782 deaths Category:French Navy officers Category:Grand Crosses of the Order of Saint Louis ","title":"Aymar Joseph de Roquefeuil et du Bousquet"},{"id":"20195730","text":"Epirranthis diversata is a moth of the family Geometridae.

Howard, published by the American company Marvel Comics. It debuted with a first issue cover-dated October 1970 and ran for 275 issues until 1993. A significant commercial success, the title launched a sword-and-sorcery vogue in American 1970s comics. Marvel Comics reacquired the publishing rights in 2018, and started a new run of Conan the Barbarian in January 2019 with the creative team of writer Jason Aaron and artist Mahmud A. Asrar. == Publication history == Conan the Barbarian ran for 275 issues (cover dated October 1970‚ÄìDecember 1993). The book had a single writer, Roy Thomas, on issues #1‚Äì115 (October 1970‚ÄìOctober 1980) and then #240‚Äì275 (January 1991‚ÄìDecember 1993). It was also the signature work of artist Barry Smith, who pencilled most issues between #1 and #24. Artist John Buscema pencilled the vast bulk of issues #25‚Äì190. Interim writers included J. M. DeMatteis, Bruce Jones, Michael Fleisher, Doug Moench, Jim Owsley, Alan Zelenetz, Chuck Dixon, and Don Kraar. Thomas, Marvel's associate editor at the time, had obtained the licensed property from the estate of its creator, Robert E. Howard, after finding Conan chief among readers' requests for literary properties to be adapted to comics, which also included the pulp magazine character Doc Savage, the Lord of the Rings oeuvre of writer J. R. R. Tolkien, and Edgar Rice Burroughs' characters Tarzan and John Carter of Mars. Elaborating in 2010, he said, Thomas said another reason for pursuing Thongor was that Marvel editor-in-chief Stan Lee \\"liked that name the most. . . . I soon got stalled by Lin Carter's agent on Thongor . . . and I got a sudden impulse to go after Conan. Later, following on the success of the Conan series, Lin Carter allowed Marvel to publish a Thongor comic, which appeared as a miniseries in Creatures on the Loose.\\" After reading and enjoying the paperback Conan of Cimmeria, Thomas contacted Glen Lord, literary agent for the Howard estate, and \\"I said we can't offer much money but it might increase Conan's audience and so forth, what do you think? I didn't have much elasticity, but I was so embarrassed by the $150 that I upped it to $200 without thinking. So that when Glen agreed ... I decided I'd have to write the first issue or so, so that if Goodman objected I could knock a couple pages off my rate to even things out.\\" The extra cost meant, however, that Marvel could not budget for Buscema, Thomas' first choice, serendipitously opening the door to Smith. Buscema, in a 1994 interview, recalled, Comics historian Les Daniels noted that \\"Conan the Barbarian was something of a gamble for Marvel. The series contained the usual elements of action and fantasy, to be sure, but it was set in a past that had no relation to the Marvel Universe, and it featured a hero who possessed no magical powers, little humor and comparatively few moral principles.\\" Marvel initially published Conan every two months. After sales of #1 were strong Marvel quickly made the title monthly, but sales dropped with each additional issue. Lee decided to cancel the comic with #7, not only because of the weak sales but to use Smith on more popular comics. Thomas argued against the decision and Lee relented, although the book became bimonthly again with #14. By #20 Conan again became monthly because of rising sales, and the comic became one of Marvel's most popular in the 1970s. Elric of Melnibon√© first appeared in comics in Conan the Barbarian issues #14‚Äì15 (March‚ÄìMay 1972). The comics were written by Thomas and illustrated by Windsor-Smith, based on a story plotted by Michael Moorcock and James Cawthorn. Red Sonja was introduced in issue #23 (February 1973).Daniels p. 150: \\"One especially felicitous extrapolation was Red Sonja, a minor Howard character transformed by Thomas into a companion for Conan.\\" In 2010, Comics Bulletin ranked Thomas' work on Conan the Barbarian with Smith and Buscema seventh on its list of the \\"Top 10 1970s Marvels\\". == Annuals and Giant-Size series == Twelve issues of Conan Annual were published from 1973 to 1987.

He led a brigade and then a division in the Army of the Cumberland in several of the most significant campaigns of the Western Theater of operations. Wilson & Fiske, \\"William Passmore Carlin\\" in Appleton's Cyclopedia Vol. 1, p. 527 ==Early life== William P. Carlin was born at Rich Woods in Greene County, Illinois, and educated in the local schools. His parents were William B. Carlin (1804-1850) and Mary Carlin (n√©e Goode, 1805-1888).http://trees.ancestry.com/tree/12392397/family?cfpid=1326264207&selnode;=1 His uncle Thomas Carlin, a Jacksonian Democrat and veteran of the War of 1812 served as Illinois' governor when William was a boy. He received an appointment to the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York, and graduated in 1850, ranking 20th out of 44. Among his classmates were future six Civil War generals, including Gouverneur K. Warren and William L. Cabell. ==Early career== Carlin was appointed a brevet second lieutenant in the 6th U.S. Infantry and assigned to duty on the Western frontier at Fort Snelling and other subsequent posts. He spent much of the next decade on garrison duty, although he participated in several minor campaigns and expeditions to quell warring Plains Indians, including William S. Harney's 1855 campaign against the Sioux (for which he was promoted to first lieutenant) and the 1857 expedition of Edwin V. Sumner against the Cheyenne tribe. He then was involved in the Utah War in 1858 in a U.S. Army force led by Albert Sidney Johnston, a future Confederate general. Carlin rose to the rank of captain in the Regular Army. From September 1859 through May 1860, he commanded Fort Bragg in California.Fort Bragg website and history Retrieved 2008-11-14. ==Civil War== Shortly after the outbreak of the Civil War in early 1861, Carlin was commissioned on August 5 by the Governor of Illinois, Richard Yates, as the colonel and first commander of the new 38th Illinois Infantry. He and his regiment were shipped to Missouri to help stabilize the region under Federal control. He participated in the Battle of Fredericktown on October 21, where his men help rout part of the Missouri State Guard under M. Jeff Thompson. As a reward for his performance, in November Carlin took command of the Southeastern Missouri District, a post he held through the winter into early spring of 1862 when he was assigned to lead a brigade of infantry. He first led his brigade into combat during the Siege of Corinth, Mississippi, in May of that year. Fighting against the Confederates of Braxton Bragg during the autumn Kentucky Campaign, Carlin received multiple commendations for bravery for a successful charge at the Battle of Perryville that almost cut off the Confederate line of retreat, but it was called back, under protest, by his corps commander. After the battle he protested the lack of recognition his command received and privately chided division commander Lovell H. Rousseau for \\"crawling around trees on his belly [which] is not such conduct as soldiers admire.\\"National Archives, RG 108, E22, M1635, W. P. Carlin to John C. Kelton, October 17, 1862 Carlin was promoted to brigadier general in the Union Army on November 29, 1862. A month later, his brigade in the Army of the Cumberland suffered high casualties during the Battle of Stones River in Tennessee. For the next year and a half, Carlin commanded the 2nd Brigade, 1st Division of the XX Corps. He participated in the Tullahoma Campaign and the subsequent Battle of Chickamauga. In the autumn of 1863, he fought at Lookout Mountain and Missionary Ridge during the Battles for Chattanooga. In the summer of 1864, he led his brigade in the Atlanta Campaign, taking a brief furlough during the campaign to return to Illinois to be married. He was promoted to divisional command before the Battle of Jonesboro in September. He then took part in Sherman's March to the Sea and the capture of Savannah, Georgia. In early 1865, Carlin's division was involved in the Carolinas Campaign. At the Battle of Bentonville on March 19, it conducted a \\"probing attack\\" that was routed by a major Confederate counterattack in which General Carlin narrowly escaped capture. At the end of the war, he received brevet appointments to major general in both the volunteer Union Army and the Regular Army. ==Postbellum career== Carlin mustered out of the volunteers in the summer of 1865 and returned to the Regular Army as the major of the 16th U.S. Infantry. He was the assistant commissioner of the Tennessee office of the Freedmen's Bureau from 1867 until 1868. He was promoted to colonel in April 1882 and later to brigadier general, and held various commands at army posts throughout the country. He put down a miners' strike in the Idaho Territory and served in several posts in the South during Reconstruction. Carlin retired from the Army in 1893 after 43 years of service. He wrote and published his autobiography, Memoirs of Brigadier General William Passmore Carlin, USA, which detailed his long career. ==Death and legacy== While traveling on a train near Whitehall, Montana, in 1903, Carlin died suddenly. His body was shipped home to Carrollton, Illinois, for burial.Eicher, p. 163. The town of Carlin, Nevada, was named for him. ==See also== *List of American Civil War generals (Union) ==NotesReferences== * Carlin, William P.

It is based on the 1934 play Accent on Youth written by Samson Raphaelson. ==Plot== Russ Ward is a Broadway producer with a 30-year record of success who has been out of town. On returning to New York, everybody wants a piece of him: ex-wife Kathryn Ward, hard-drinking playwright Jeremiah \\"Mac\\" MacDonald, magazine reporter Roy Morton, business manager Miles Atwood, and lawyer Charles Montgomery, one after another. The main topic of discussion is Give Me Your Hand, the new play Russ is producing. The reporter hears it's in trouble, but Russ says that's untrue. It will be ready for its Boston tryout right on schedule, he vows. Kathryn keeps reminding him of his age, which Russ likes to lie about. Russ tells loyal young secretary and student actress Ellie Brown it is likely time to retire because the new show is a mess. He and writer Mac have a story about a middle-aged man romancing a 22-year-old woman, and just can't seem to make it work. Ellie is in love with Russ, so much so she proposes marriage to him. That gives him an idea. What if the play had the young woman pursuing the man? That way he wouldn't seem such a lecher. A delighted Mac rewrites it, and everyone involved works on it at the Long Island mansion where the former actress Kathryn lives, partly thanks to her alimony from Russ. A rich backer named Bacos wants in, but Atwood says his money isn't needed because an anonymous angel is financing the whole show. Ellie reads the woman's part, and strikes everybody as perfect for it. Gordon Reynolds, an up-and-coming young actor in Ellie's acting class, gets the male lead, and promptly falls for Ellie, but she's being led on by Russ, who doesn't discourage her love for him. The show's so-so in Boston, and a few of them panic, but Russ insists it'll be a hit on Broadway, and, sure enough, he's right. Now, he needs to let down Ellie gently, and next thing he knows, she and Gordon have gotten married. Ellie returns exasperated because Gordon wants to give up theater and move to Montana. She strips and leaps into Russ's bed so Gordon can catch her there and demand an annulment. Everybody gets every misunderstanding sorted out. The newly-weds decide to compromise, and Russ, who finally has figured out that Kathryn was the anonymous angel who financed the show, is ready to give their relationship a second act. ==Cast== *Clark Gable ...

The company's name in all caps is a trademarked brand name used to market a particular type of facial surgery called the lifestyle lift. In 2012, Debby Boone became the spokesperson for the company in its television commercials and its half-hour infomercial. The company discontinued using Boone in late 2013 shifting to a new advertising campaign. The company abruptly closed all its offices in early March 2015 and announced its intention to declare bankruptcy. The procedure is advertised as a minimally invasive, short-flap face lift performed under local anesthesia. The procedure involves the excess skin and superficial muscular aponeurotic system (SMAS) layer. ==Company history== Lifestyle Lift was founded by Dr. David Kent, whose previous medical practice focused on otolaryngology head and neck surgery, facial plastic surgery and hair replacement. Kent completed an osteopathic residency in otolaryngology-head and neck surgery and facial plastic surgery. He is a member of the American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery and board certified by the American Osteopathic College of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery. Kent was recently named Ernst & Young's 2012 Entrepreneur of the Year. He started Lifestyle Lift in 2001 with one office and has grown it to over 50 surgical, consultation and affiliated offices with more than 100 physicians.\\"Lifestyle Lift Founder Dr. Kent Named Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year\\" June 15, 2012 R. James Koch joined Lifestyle Lift in 2006 as medical director and oversaw medical training for the company. Prior to joining Lifestyle Lift, Koch was a full-time faculty member at the Stanford University School of Medicine where he served as associate professor, co-director of the Division of Facial Plastic Surgery, and co-director of the Fellowship for Advanced Facial Plastic & Reconstructive Surgery.http://www.biomedexperts.com/Profile.bme/723818/R_James_Koch Koch resigned from the organization in 2010 and was replaced by three regional medical directors that same year and who were subsequently named medical directors in 2012: David Santos, Pacific and Mountain Regions; Jason Swerdloff, Southeast and Northeast Regions; Carlos Farias, Midwest and Northeast Regions. The company closed its operations and filed for bankruptcy on March 2, 2015. ==Claims== The company website lists 172,255 completed surgeries as of 5 February 2014. There are almost 200 reviews of the company out of over 150,000 customers‚Äîsome of them negative‚Äîon RealSelf.com, which Lifestyle Lift sued for trademark infringement (the case was settled). Lifestyle Lift has attempted to sue other companies based on trademark infringement, including informercialscams.com (now defunct). In 2008, Lifestyle Lift was the subject of an eight-part mini-series by the CBS affiliate in Atlanta featuring three dissatisfied Lifestyle Lift patients, and former employees and their complaints against the company. In 2009, a Florida woman died just hours after undergoing a cosmetic facial surgery at a Lifestyle Lift center in Maitland, Florida. ==Malpractice claims== Lifestyle Lift¬Æ and/or its doctors have been the subject of multiple alleged malpractice claims in the state of Florida. ==ComplaintsMarketing practices=== In 2009 Lifestyle Lift reached a settlement with New York state over claims it had posted false customer endorsements on third-party websites, including RealSelf.com, and on some websites the company had created for the purpose. Lifestyle Lift was ordered to pay $300,000 to the state, and it agreed to cease the practice. In 2013, after a three-year review of all aspects of Lifestyle Lift marketing, the Florida Attorney General found that Lifestyle Lift was compliant with all state regulations. As a result, no fines were levied, but Lifestyle Lift reimbursed the State of Florida for costs of the investigation and made a donation to a Florida Attorney General sponsored charity. During the course of the investigation, Lifestyle Lift voluntarily made several minor changes to its marketing materials to ensure clarity for consumers. ===Safety issues=== In 2008, an Orlando, Florida, plastic surgeon filed a complaint with the Florida Board of Medicine, seeking payment for emergency room services he provided to a Lifestyle Lift patient; the company denied that it was negligent. Lifestyle Lift was also the subject of a March 2010 lawsuit filed by the family of a Massachusetts patient who died as a result of complications with local anesthesia in July 2009. The suit alleged that doctors failed to monitor the woman's vital signs during the procedure; in a statement, Lifestyle Lift responded that the woman had failed to disclose pertinent medical information. In an August 2011 lawsuit filed in Broward County, Florida, a patient claimed she developed keloid scars within days following a Lifestyle Lift facelift, and that the doctor had lied about the risks of scarring. In a statement to the press, Lifestyle Lift indicated disagreement with the \\"accounting of events\\" described in the suit, and said it remained supportive of its surgeon. ==Procedure== The procedure involves an incision made along the temple hairline and continuing down around the front of the ear or following the natural curves of the ear. The typical incision makes an S shape although the incision length and type can differ between surgeons and is individualized for each patient. The incision is made in front of and behind each ear. Once these cuts are made, the deeper muscle or SMAS tissue is pulled up and back (and possibly trimmed) and sutured into place. The excess skin is then trimmed off and the incision is closed. Liposuction may be used to reduce fat from under the chin. In addition, the muscle bands in the neck may be sutured together to lessen their appearance. Lifestyle Lift surgeons also perform eyelid surgeries, brow lifting, fractional CO2 laser skin resurfacing, fat grafting, and chin augmentation. ==See also== *Rhytidectomy ==References * Category:Plastic surgery organizations Category:Oral and maxillofacial surgery Category:Companies based in Troy, Michigan Category:Companies established in 2001 Category:2001 establishments in the United States ","title":"Lifestyle Lift"},{"id":"20196015","text":"Trboje (; Leksikon obƒçin kraljestev in de≈æel zastopanih v dr≈æavnem zboru, vol. 6: Kranjsko. 1906.

It lies east of Lake Trboje. ==Geography== Lake Trboje Trboje lies on the left bank of the Sava River along the road from Kranj to Smlednik. The soil in the area is sandy, and there are fields in the east part of the settlement toward Smlednik and Voklo.Savnik, Roman, ed. 1968. Krajevni leksikon Slovenije, vol. 1. Ljubljana: Dr≈æavna zalo≈æba Slovenije, p. 171. The Sava River was dammed in 1986, when the Mavƒçiƒçe Hydroelectric Plant was built. The reservoir that was created is known as Lake Trboje.Dobrodo≈°li v Kranju: Trbojsko jezero. ==Name== Trboje was attested in written records in 1118 as Trebesbach and Trebespach (and as Treffpach in 1313, Trespach in 1436, Treboyach in 1436, Triboyan in 1483, and Threwoiach in 1597). The origin of the name is unclear, but may be derived through haplology from *Trƒõbob«´ƒèe selo 'Trƒõbob«´d—ä's village', referring to an early settler. If so, the originally neuter adjective later became a plural noun. Theories deriving the name from the verb *trƒõbiti 'to clear (cut)' are less likely.Snoj, Marko. 2009. Etimolo≈°ki slovar slovenskih zemljepisnih imen. Ljubljana: Modrijan and Zalo≈æba ZRC, p. 434. In the past the German name was Terboje. ==History== Most of the village was burned in a fire in 1883, destroying the church and 60 houses, which were later rebuilt.Krajevni leksikon Dravske Banovine. 1937. Ljubljana: Zveza za tujski promet za Slovenijo, p. 248. The village was also heavily damaged in an 1895 earthquake. ==Church== Assumption Church The church in the village is dedicated to the Assumption of Mary. It is a Baroque structure dating from 1743 (the year is carved on the exterior wall of the chancel). The church originally belonged to the Parish of Smlednik, was a quasi-parish from 1785 to 1795, and only a chapelry from 1795 to 1809. The church burned in 1883 and was then damaged in the 1895 Ljubljana earthquake, after which it was renovated.Information sign on the church. It was not elevated to parish status until 1912. Oral tradition states that the church was once a pilgrimage destination. The main altar features a statue of Mary holding the infant Jesus; the left side altar is dedicated to Saint Nicholas, and the right side altar to the Adoration of the Magi. The church contains paintings by Leopold Layer (1752‚Äì1828) and the bell tower contains four bells. Chapel-shrine below church A chapel-shrine below the church in the village is dedicated to the Virgin Mary and contains a statue from the old church. The statue was adorned with various gifts, also displayed in the shrine, when requests to the Virgin Mary were fulfilled. Two additional shrines‚Äîa triangular masonry shrine in the middle of the village, and the Burgar shrine outside the village‚Äîare noteworthy for their paintings. ==Notable people== Notable people that were born or lived in Trboje include: *Josip Tiƒçar (1875‚Äì1946), healthcare and hiking specialist≈†avli, Ivan. 1957. \\"Ob desetletnici smrti dr.

The M33 cluster bomb, also known as the (M33) Brucella cluster bomb, was a U.S. biological cluster bomb developed in the early 1950s and deployed in 1952. It was the first standardized biological weapon in the U.S. arsenal. ==History== The U.S. Army Chemical Corps selected Brucella suis as its first mass-produced biological agent in 1949. Tests at Dugway Proving Ground followed in 1950 and 1951. These tests paved the way for the first mass-produced biological weapon in the U.S. arsenal in 1952.Croddy, Eric and Wirtz, James J. Weapons of Mass Destruction: An Encyclopedia of Worldwide Policy, Technology, and History, (Google Books), ABC-CLIO, 2005, p. 75, (), accessed November 13, 2008. ==Specifications== The M33 cluster bomb was a biological munition that initially carried the biological agent Brucella suis. The M33 held 108 M114 anti-personnel bombs; each M114 held about 320 milliliters of B. suis culture.Smart, Jeffery K. Medical Aspects of Chemical and Biological Warfare : Chapter 2 - History of Chemical and Biological Warfare: An American Perspective, (PDF: p. 51), Borden Institute, Textbooks of Military Medicine, PDF via Maxwell-Gunter Air Force Base, accessed November 13, 2008. Besides B. suis the M33 was tested with other agents throughout the 1950s. The M33 was an air-released munition: released at high altitude, it would eject its bomblets while still aloft. Each bomblet would then explode using its own detonator.Regis, Edward. The Biology of Doom: The History of America's Secret Germ Warfare Project, (Google Books), Macmillan, 2000, p. 140-56, (). ==Issues== The M33 presented a special logistical problem. The agent used, B. suis, required refrigeration which created a logistical \\"nightmare\\". In addition, experts calculated that to attain a proper infection rate over an area of one square mile up to 16 separate M33s were required; around 1,500 individual bomblets. The large number of biological weapons made transport of the weapons for 1952 tests more difficult. The M33 cluster bomb was never used in battle. ==Tests involving the M33== The M33 cluster bomb was used in a series of tests from August-October 1952. At Dugway Proving Ground, Utah, the Army Chemical Corps exposed over 11,000 guinea pigs to B. suis via air-dropped M33s. Although the guinea pig trials caused one Chemical Corps general to remark, \\"Now we know what to do if we ever go to war against guinea pigs\\", the tests resulted in the realization that the M33 could not compete with the casualty volume caused by atomic weapons. ==References== Category:Biological weapon delivery systems Category:Cluster bombs ","title":"M33 cluster bomb"},{"id":"20196093","text":"Jacques Aymar de Roquefeuil et du Bousquet (14 November 1665, in ch√¢teau du Bousquet, Montpeyroux, Rouergue ‚Äì 8/9 March 1744) was a French Navy admiral. ==Family== He was the younger brother of Louis, Baron de Roquefeuil et du Bousquet and a member of the House of Roquefeuil-Blanquefort, one of the most illustrious Languedoc families.

Operating strictly from donations and fund raising, CAF is dedicated to assisting federal and local law enforcement agencies in the recovery of missing and abducted children and elderly individuals. The Child Alert Foundation helps law enforcement notify their surrounding communities with their copyrighted Abduction Central Alert (ACA) community alert notification system. The Child Alert Foundation was the first organization to ever create a fully automated implementation of the Amber Plan outlined in 1997 in Dallas, Texas, which has since become the AMBER Alert. The original Amber Plan (1997) was a faxed based procedure where law enforcement agencies were required to prepare information for public distribution and then fax that information to a list of designated primary radio stations. This was a manual procedure and time-consuming process. The ACA system created by Child Alert is a totally automated procedure that was designed from the very beginning to exceed the original Amber Plan requirements. Rather than limit the alert to radio, CAF expanded coverage to include television and news organizations as well as other law enforcement agencies for notification. In addition to sending faxes as the original plan required, the ACA system sends emails, alert pagers, send text messaging, build automatic web pages, posters and more. The ACA system also provides full circle notifications by issuing closure alerts when an incident is terminated. Since its original implementation in 1998, the ACA system has been further expanded to assist law enforcement with notifying the community when a Silver Alert is issued for missing elderly individuals. ==History== The Child Alert Foundation (CAF) was founded in 1998 by Col. Vincent A. Albers Jr.(USMC Retired), Nancy T. Albers, Vincent A. Albers III and Marlene R. Slater to help law enforcement agencies across the nation immediately notify their surrounding communities of missing and abducted children. With their collective backgrounds in computer technology, applications development and telecommunications, they collaborated and created a new Alert Notification System (ANS) that was called Abduction Central Alert (ACA) in honor of all missing children across the nation. With the ACA system, an alert area of one hundred (100) miles is centered around the initial abduction location and establishes a \\"zone of influence\\" for the notification area. Since the first hour of any abduction is critical and an abduction vehicle can travel over 60 miles an hour, one minute can equal a mile and this was the reason why the 100 mile radius distance was selected. The alert \\"zone of influence\\" represents a virtual net that can cross state and local boundaries and provides law enforcement with a greater advantage of apprehending a perpetrator in that first hour. This system can immediately notify a variety of agencies and organizations of missing and/or abducted individuals in a matter of seconds of being activated. In May 2001, the Child Alert Foundation released their infrared digital fingerprinting services program called the ACA Child Identification Poster System (ACA CHIPS). This program automated the old Polaroid photograph and ink fingerprint concept of providing child identification services and stored information digitally on disk that could easily be retrieved and imported into the automated Abduction Central Alert (ACA) community alert notification system. The CHIPS program interfaces with a digital video camera to take real time video snapshots and an infrared fingerprint scanner to capture digital impressions of a child's fingerprints. This information is saved in various digital formats on a disk or flash drive and given only to parents and guardians to access in case of an emergency. In the unfortunate event that a child is reported missing and/or abducted, the digital information can immediately be reloaded into an alert notification system (ANS) program like Abduction Central Alert so that an Amber Alert can be immediately activated by law enforcement. Law enforcement could use ACA CHIPS to provide parents and guardians with child identification disks as a community service. Parents in turn could provide the CHIPS disks back to law enforcement in the case of an emergency so that an expedited Amber Alert could be activated using the ACA system to notify their surrounding community of a missing child. ==See also== * AMBER Alert * Silver Alert ==References== * Pervasive Software News Alert * CAF Case Study By Pegasus Imaging * Amber Alert: 10 Years Old, 400 Successful Child Recoveries * National Silver Alert: Securing Our Seniors ==External links== * Child Alert Foundation Category:Non- profit organizations based in Pennsylvania Category:Foundations based in the United States Category:Children's charities based in the United States Category:Organizations established in 1998 ","title":"Child Alert Foundation"},{"id":"20196115","text":"The Roquefeuil family is a French noble family.

She was the daughter of King Ottokar I of Bohemia and his first wife, Adelaide of Meissen. ==Early life== Margaret's father, Ottokar I, became Duke of Bohemia in 1192, but in 1193 was deposed. He then left Bohemia with his family. His wife, Adelaide, and their children found a new home at the court of her brother Albert I, Margrave of Meissen. Ottokar became a mercenary for German rulers. In 1197, Ottokar became the Duke of Bohemia for a second time. He repudiated Adelaide and divorced her in 1199 on the grounds of consanguinity. He married Constance of Hungary later the same year. This step, together with other maneuvers, helped him later to obtain the hereditary elevation of his title to king. Adelaide did not waive her rights. In 1205, she returned to Prague temporarily. At that time, Ottokar decided to marry their daughter, Margaret, to Valdemar II of Denmark. His new wife Constance gave birth to a son, later King Wenceslaus I of Bohemia, the same year. Adelaide left Bohemia soon and died a few years later. ==Queen== Before his first marriage, Valdemar had been betrothed to Richeza of Bavaria, daughter of the Duke of Saxony. When that engagement fell through, he married Margaret, now known as Dagmar, in 1205 at L√ºbeck. According to the records of Annales Ryenses (Ryd√•rbogen), in 1206 Queen Dagmar influenced Valdemar to release one of his most fervent enemies, Valdemar, Bishop of Schleswig, who had been held in captivity since 1193. In 1209, Queen Dagmar gave birth to Valdemar the Young (c. 1209‚Äì1231). Queen Dagmar died on 24 May 1212 while giving birth to her second son, who did not survive. Valdemar II elevated Valdemar the Young as co-king at Schleswig in 1218. However, Valdemar was accidentally shot with an arrow while hunting at Refsn√¶s in North Jutland during 1231. Not many things are known about Dagmar as a person. Most of the image of Dagmar comes from later folksongs, myths and legends, designed to present her as an ideal Christian queen; mild, patient and universally loved, in contrast to her unpopular successor, Queen Berengaria. Old folk ballads say that on her deathbed she begged Valdemar to marry Kirsten, the daughter of Karl von Rise, and not the \\"beautiful flower\\" Bereng√°ria of Portugal. In other words, she predicted a struggle for the Danish throne between the sons of Berengaria. After Dagmar's death, in order to build good relations with Flanders (a commercially important territory to the west of Denmark's hostile southern neighbours), Valdemar married Bereng√°ria of Portugal in 1214. Queen Dagmar is buried in St. Bendt's Church in Ringsted, on one side of Valdemar II, with Queen Bereng√°ria buried on the other side of the King. ==Dagmar Cross == Dagmar Cross (Dagmarkorset) Reverse of Dagmar Cross A pectoral cross now well known as the Dagmar Cross (Dagmarkorset) was found lying on the breast of Queen Dagmar remains when the tomb was opened in 1683. In 1695 the cross was donated to the National Gallery of Denmark. The jewel of Byzantine design and workmanship, is of gold, enamelled, having on one side a crucifix, and on the other side portraits of Christ in the center, St Basil, St John Chrysostom, Mary the Virgin and St John the Apostle-Evangelist. In 1863, King Frederik VII of Denmark donated a replica of the cross to Princess Alexandra of Denmark, daughter of the later King Christian IX of Denmark when she married the Prince of Wales, later King Edward VII of England. In the modern era, the Dagmar Cross \\"is worn by Danish girls for their confirmation into the Lutheran Church, and is also given to children as a baptismal gift.\\" In the Lutheran Church of Sweden, \\"the cross is now delivered to the new bishop, on his installation in office, by the Archbishop of Uppsala, together with the mitre and crozier.\\" ==Gallery== File:Ribe.

Independent Australian Scouts emphasizes scouting as a simple, experiential, outdoor activity emulating frontier scouts in being self-reliant, thrifty and resourceful and useful and helpful. The association views the Scout Movement as part of the wider Woodcraft Movement. The association eschews the cult-like idolization of Baden-Powell, \\"family scouting\\", the unnecessary connection of scouting with later juvenile Wolf Cub (and Beaver, Kea or Joey) schemes and the adult over-organization of scouting and its monopolization and manipulation as a commercial product.Scouts of Australia - a rationale, Scouts of Australia, Sydney 1992 ==History== Independent Australian Scouts began as the Independent Scouts of Australia in 1986.

The gap of locomotive manufacturing industry between China and developed countries is relatively large, especially in high-power electric locomotive and EMUs. After technology acquisition, China has acquired high-power electric locomotives, diesel locomotives and 200 km/h EMUs. Presently, the localization rate of parts and components of electric locomotive and EMUs reaches 70 per cent and 75 per cent respectively, and China has developed 300 km/h EMUs based on digesting and absorbing overseas' new technologies. ==International manufacturers== In terms of the international railway equipment market that global railway equipment industry is on a more monopoly competitive circumstance. The merger of locomotives and railway car plants has restructured global railway equipment market that global railway equipment giant dominated more market share. Presently, there are three global giant of global locomotive and railway car plants‚ÄîGermany's Siemens, France's Alstom and Canada's Bombardier, they hold 55 per cent of total global market share (each 14%, 18% and 23%) and advanced technology and higher market concentration. Bombardier holds the largest market share of global railway equipment technology and sales market and Alstom remains advantage on EMUs and ordinary single-decker and double-decker electric locomotive market. ==Chinese manufacturers== Although the number of China's railway equipment manufacturers is quite large and products is relatively various, but the weakness is that they produce the speed of below 200 km/h general train's low-end products and the production capacity is surplus and price competition is in chaos; and the lack of design and production capacity of advanced technology of railway equipment which can not meet the demands of high-end products. In order to adapt to the demand of current railway development, the Chinese government took a measure to pay huge amounts of money through international cooperation with international leading manufacturers to introduce high-end products, digesting and absorbing advanced manufacturing technology to upgrading Chinese railway equipment's technology level. ==High-speed rail== The high-speed railway equipment manufacturing industry is the priority fields that supporting by governmental policy. In terms of the current circumstance of China's railway equipment manufacturing industry, is in a low level of technology, therefore, government policies are encouraging localization and the introduction of advanced technology then digestion and absorption, the Chinese government spent 10 billion yuan to buy advanced international technology for state-owned enterprises to upgrade their technology capability and offered huge amounts of orders. ==Investment== The total railway fixed assets investment of China's Eleventh Five-Year Plan period was 1.5 trillion yuan, of which the purchase of rolling stock and the investment of technological transformation is 250 billion yuan.

Initially it had been called the Peter Pan Magic Club until the name change of F.A.M.E. in the early 1950s. After overseer Abraham \\"Abe\\" Hurwitz died in 1981, the remnants of the club became the Society of Young Magicians, which was started by F.A.M.E alum Dick Brooks. Many early F.A.M.E. members would go on to become famous American magicians, magic consultants, puppeteers, and motion picture and television personalities. Most notably, Shari Lewis (daughter of overseer \\"Abe\\" Hurwitz) would gain major recognition in the Emmy and Peabody award-winning children's TV series Lamb Chop on PBS; Stan Burns would principally star with Madonna in Desperately Seeking Susan (1985) and in Woody Allen's Radio Days (1987), both as a New York ventriloquist; George Schindler would write for many Billboard magic/comedy columns (1950s-1960s), publish at least 8 magic books, do TV commercial voice acting, star as a magician in Woody Allen's New York Stories (1989) and hold title as spokesman, president and dean of the Society of American Magicians; and Dick Brooks would open the Magic Towne House (now closed) in Manhattan and the Houdini Museum, the Only Building in the World Dedicated to Houdini, in Scranton, Pennsylvania with collaborator Dorothy Dietrich. == Founder == Dr. Abraham Hurwitz, known as \\"Peter Pan the Magic Man\\", originally headed the club. Hurwitz was a Yeshiva University education professor who was so reputed in the American magic scene that he was named New York City's \\"official magician\\" by then-Mayor Fiorello La Guardia. Hurwitz was a city recreation director when Mayor La Guardia gave him the official magician title during the Depression. For 18 years, he took his magic show to schools and recreation centers and put on annual magic shows in parks in every NYC borough. For years after he left the department he continued his magic shows as a volunteer. Among his prot√©g√©s was his daughter, television star Shari Lewis, the world-famous ventriloquist and developer of Lamb Chop. Hurwitz was born in Lithuania in 1905. He graduated from City College of New York, obtained his master's degree from Columbia University and his Ph.D. in educational guidance from New York University. He began mixing magic with teaching as a guidance counselor at the Brooklyn Hebrew Orphanage. He retired from Yeshiva in 1974 and died on September 29, 1981. == Early members == A few earlier members of the Peter Pan Magic Club before it changed its name to F.A.M.E. included George Schindler, Stan Burns, George Gilbert (Lott), Albert Goshman, Ken Krenzel, Jack London (Harry Rifas), Danny O'Brien (Blackwood), George Sands, Vic Sendax, Len Cooper, Sonny Sklar, Jerry Bergman, Howie Schwarzman and Shari Lewis. == Name change to F.A.M.E. == In the 1950s, the then members decided the name of the club was childish and changed it to FAME Future American Magical Entertainers and included Dick Brooks, Ken Silverman (who became a Pulitzer Prize winning author and wrote a biography of Houdini), John Hope, Robert A. Olson, (Hope and Olson later wrote a column on coin magic in Hugard's Magic Monthly), Richard Bangs, Al Callus, David Levy, Burt Kaplan, Jeff Spiller, Dan Ritchard, Mike Eberton, Melvin Kelger, Sheldon Weiner, Mike Goldstein, Leonard Heller, Kichi Iamoto, Hank Lifson, Jerry Goldstein and many others. (see official 1952 roster) At that time it was run by Antoinette Deutch, Bob White, and Lou Dick. The acronym FAME came about when the members decided the Peter Pan name was a bit childish, especially after a comment from comedy magician Carl Ballantine, \\"I love your peanut butter\\". The FAME acronym was suggested by Dick Brooks (entertainer). Among later magicians who joined included Jeff Spiller, Diane Zalph, Jeff Silverstein, Debbie Leifer, Jeff Sheridan, Robin Lane and others. == Society of American Magicians == In the early 1960s the S.A.M. sponsored a club for young magicians known as the I.M.P.S. (Independent Magical Performers Society). This club had its original branch in New York City under the direction of veteran magician (and inventor of magical apparatus) Arnold Belais, who was in his late 70's; at most meetings, Belais was assisted by Marshall Johnson, a magic enthusiast who was employed as a television producer/director at the CBS studios on 57th St. During its peak, the I.M.P.S. met once a month in Manhattan at the West Side YMCA on West 63rd St; here, in addition to giving the young members a chance to perform and polish their technique, adult performers/lecturers would often take part in the proceedings by offering guidance, advice, and impromptu performances for the young magicians and ventriloquists that comprised the club. Several times in the mid and late 1960s, the group was even visited by talent scout Mark Letti (who was well known in NY entertainment circles as a 'talent spotter' for Ed Sullivan's popular Sunday night television variety show). In addition to their I.M.P.S. sponsorship, the S.A.M. awarded \\"scholarships\\" to qualifying IMPS when they became old enough to apply for SAM membership. A North Jersey branch was established in the late 1960s that met in Tenafly as well as another New Jersey branch which met several times a year in Perth Amboy (until the late 1960s). The New York I.M.P.S. club remained active into the 1970s (although meeting less frequently) and for a brief time survived the passing of its founding leader, Arnold Belais. Currently, young people can join a new organization, SYM Society of Young Magicians, which is a branch of the Society of American Magicians. SYM was conceived in 1981 and founded in 1984 by 6 members of the S.A.M. Dan Rodriguez, Edward Schuman, Ray- Mond, Wendel Gibson, Dick Laneau and Donald Lea. == Sources == * Thanks to magician and Dean and former SAM President George Schindler for his help in accumulating and checking the accuracy of much of the information on this page. * The Who's Who in Magic * Obituary: Abraham Hurwitz Dead at 76 == References == Category:Defunct organizations based in New York City Category:Organizations established in the 1940s Category:Magic clubs Category:Organizations disestablished in the 1980s ","title":"Future American Magical Entertainers"},{"id":"20196348","text":"Charles Gabriel Morel d'Escures (3 January 1751, Alen√ßon ‚Äì 13 July 1786, Baie des Fran√ßais, Lituya, Alaska) was a French navigator and explorer and a member of the La P√©rouse expedition (1 August 1785 to 13 July 1786) and of the Acad√©mie de Marine. ==Life== Training at the Ecole royale de Marine (1773‚Äì1775), he fought in several campaigns from 1776 to 1783 and held his last command on the la Dorade (decommissioned in 1783).

The university traces its roots back to 1938. ==HistorySoviet period=== Chechen State University, formerly Grozney University, saw a surge of development between 1970 and 1980. Botanical gardens were built in the mountainous areas of the Chechen Republic. Technologies developed at the university were used in aviation design for Tupolev, and many of the university's scientific discoveries were displayed at the All-Union Agricultural Exhibition of the USSR and at international exhibitions. Regional scientific conferences were held on campus, including the All-Union Agricultural Exhibition. ===After the Chechen War=== Military activity in the Chechen Republic during the Second Chechen War interrupted the development of Grozny University and destroyed several buildings. The university began restoration soon after the end of military operations and classes resumed in April 2000. Classrooms, laboratories, reading rooms and the scientific library were repaired. A new sports centre was one of the last projects to be completed. Much of the work was carried out by students and employees. Over 800 instructors currently work at the school's campus.

Pierre Alain Sabbagh was born in Lannion (C√¥tes-d'Armor) and died in Paris. He was the younger son of the artist Georges Hanna Sabbagh and the art historian and resistance heroine Agn√®s Humbert. His brother was naval officer Jean Sabbagh. == Television == Pierre Sabbagh became a war correspondent in the hope of finding his mother Agn√®s in World War II. He had visited her in Fresnes Prison and the Prison de la Sant√© in 1942, a few days before she was deported by the Nazis, sentenced to slave labour in Germany. In 1944, he travelled into Germany behind the advancing American army, but did not find her until he returned to Paris in 1945. Pierre Sabbagh presented and directed the first television news in the world on 29 June 1949. His greatest success was the creation, in 1966, of the programme \\"Au th√©√¢tre ce soir\\" (\\"The Theatre Tonight\\") following a strike on French television and the success of a Belgian television comedy called \\"La Bonne planque\\", which provoked the appetite of the public for this kind of programme: over 300 plays were produced in the series. To his credit also is the first audiovisual game which reunited France of the 1960s in front of the black-and-white screen: \\"L'Homme du XXe si√®cle\\" (\\"20th Century Man\\"), a game of general cultural questions which went on for many years and which finished with the final \\"Super homme du XXe si√®cle\\" (\\"20th Century Superman\\") which brought together all the previous winners of whom the comedian, Robert Manuel, beat a professor of complementary medicine, Georges Rivault. He was Director-General of the television network France 2 between September 1971 and July 1972.

As a result, in 1997, she co-founded the Religious News Service from the Arab-World (RNSAW), predecessor of Arab-West Report. Sawsan Gabra formed the selection criteria for Arab-West Report On a daily basis Sawsan selects articles for translation and coordinates this with the translators and editors.

Prior to becoming a full-time musician, Mercer worked both as a cattle farmer and as an IBM computer programmer. ==Music career== Mercer's start in the music industry was as a singer, but quickly moved to drums while still a teenager. He played several different styles in his early years, including Latin and jazz, before becoming a member of a Montreal-based band known as The Triangle, who later changed their name to Mashmakhan upon obtaining a record deal in Toronto. Mercer's work can be heard on the band's most successful single \\"As the Years Go By\\". As part of Mashmakhan, Mercer played on the Festival Express tour and was interviewed for the 2003 documentary. Following Mashmakhan's dissolution in the early 1970s, Mercer played for Roy Buchanan, and then The Wackers, before joining April Wine, who were in the process of changing their line-up following the departure of two founding members in 1973. His first public performance with the band was as an opening slot for T. Rex and Three Dog Night at Toronto's Exhibition Stadium. Shortly thereafter, he completed his first album with the band, Electric Jewels, which contained the hit \\"Weeping Widow\\". Mercer remained with the band consistently since joining, and played on all their subsequent albums and tours. In November 2008, he stated that he was retiring at the end of the year. He was replaced by Blair Mackay in January 2009. In May 2010, Mercer became the first Canadian to receive a Legends Award at the 10th annual Cape Breton International Drum Festival. In his live shows, Mercer was known for lengthy drum solos (often during April Wine's cover of King Crimson's \\"21st Century Schizoid Man\\") which frequently include a strobe light show. In addition to performing, Mercer was also involved in manufacturing drums with a company he co-founded with Bill Hibbs called Monolith Drums. Briefly assuming the brand name \\"Solstice Drums\\", now back to Monolith and about to celebrate 20 years of drum making. Mercer is no longer involved with Monolith Drums.

The Ch√¢teau de Padi√®s is a unique Renaissance ch√¢teau complex set in the Lauragais, the land of PastelCouleur Lauragais: Petite histoire du Pastel ‚Äî the Pays de Cocaigne ‚Äî Cathar country and the land of the Troubadours. The Lauragais has often been likened to Tuscany, to where the blue ‚Äúpastel‚Äù produced from the woad grown here was exported in the 15th century. The architectural and cultural influences came back (perhaps in part through Queen Catherine de' Medici, whose hunting pavilion is half an hour from here) and is very evident in the Padi√®s ‚Äúrenaissance‚Äù fa√ßades with their finely carved mullioned windows populated with fantastic mythical beings, lions' heads and symbols of plenty. The histories of Padi√®s firmly place it within its historic and geographic context. It has been established that the ch√¢teau existed at least before 1209. The Seigneurs were Cathar sympathisers and records from the Inquisition through to the 13th century are testimony to this. (The Padi√®s were betrayed by their miller!). During the Wars of Religion, the ch√¢teau was attacked and pillaged by the Protestants in 1572; the then seigneur blew himself up with the aid of a barrel of gunpowder, his wife and children were taken to nearby Puylaurens where they became Protestant. The son rebuilt Padi√®s in its present form‚Ä¶. Around a hundred years later with the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, the family reaffirmed their Catholic origins. Later, the young Emmanuel de Las Cases stayed at Padi√®s; he recorded his fond memories of the generous lady of the house, Marie-Claire Vill√®le (aunt of Jean-Baptiste de Vill√®le, a future minister of Louis XVIII), and the gardens populated with boxwood animal heads, espalliered grenadiers, the birds, the fireplace one could sit in‚Ä¶. Las Cases went on to become a general under Napoleon, and to write the M√©morial de Ste H√©l√®ne. The last of the Padi√®s were imprisoned in their ch√¢teau during the French Revolution. They were eventually pardoned because of their ‚Äúgrand old age‚Äù. They had no children. In 1800, Pierre de Padi√®s died leaving his property to his widow, Marie-Claire. She left the ch√¢teau to her family who in turn sold it to the Fabre family in 1826. Padi√®s remained in the Fabre family until 1992, the date of its acquisition by Denis Piel and Elaine Merkus, the new restorers. Padi√®s appears to be a Toulousain hotel particulier transported to the countryside, yet the mass of the building and the diagonally placed towers recall the military role of the ch√¢teau. As one of the three Seigneuries of Lempaut, Padi√®s was an integral part of village life. At the time of the Napoleonic census, forty five people lived in the immediate vicinity of the ch√¢teau.

It is dedicated to Saint Lawrence. The church was badly damaged during the Second World War and later restored. It is one of the most prominent churches of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Bavaria. ==Architecture== The nave of the church was completed by around 1400. In 1439, work began on the choir in the form of a hall church in the late German Sondergotik style of Gothic architecture. The choir was largely completed by 1477 by Konrad Roriczer,Frankl, 1960, p. 149. although Jakob Grimm completed the intricate vaults. In the choir one can find the carving of the Angelic Salutation by Veit Stoss, and the monumental tabernacle by Adam Kraft. The latter includes a prominent figure of the sculptor himself. The building and furnishing of the church was cared of by the city council and by wealthy citizens. This is probably the reason why the art treasures of St. Lawrence were spared during the iconoclasm during the Reformation period. Despite St. Lawrence being one of the first churches in Germany to be Lutheran (1525), the wealthy citizens of Nuremberg wanted to preserve the memory of their ancestors and refused the removal of the donated works of art. The west facade is richly articulated, reflecting the wealth of the Nuremberg citizens. The facade is dominated by the two towers, mirroring St. Sebald and indirectly Bamberg Cathedral with a sharp towering West portal doorway, and an indented rose window 9 metres in diameter. ==Organs== The hall choir including the sacrament house by Adam Kraft The church has three organs. *Main organ.

The weakness of the concept is that it requires calculating the maximum sustainable consumption rate of each different resource globally. This rate could be set by either the maximum sustainable yield (say for forests or fisheries) or the assimilative capacity of the environment (e.g. for or chlorine), but both quantities are very difficult to determine, so the 'environmental space' has rather large error limits and is therefore hard to defend in policy discussions. A further difficulty is that there is a different 'environmental space' for each kind of resource, and as they each necessarily have different units of measure, they cannot be added to get an overall environmental space for all the resources consumed by a country. The idea of environmental space was promoted quite strongly by Friends of the Earth Europe in the mid-1990s,Friends of the Earth webpage explaining Environmental Space (retrieved 13/11/08) but it is rarely used now, because of the aforementioned difficulties, and has essentially been superseded by 'ecological footprint'. The advantage of the ecological footprint is that every kind of resource use is converted to a land area basis, so that they can be added to produce an overall figure for a country, allowing comparisons to be made. == References == Category:Economics of sustainability ","title":"Environmental space"},{"id":"20196739","text":"The objective of synthetic array heterodyne detection is to isolate regions of a large area detector surface into virtual pixels. This provides the benefits of having multiple pixels (for example, to make an image) without having to have physical pixels (i.e. isolated detector elements). The detector can be a simple single wire output over which all the virtual pixels can be read out continuously and in parallel. The pixels are multiplexed in the frequency domain. Of special interest, this solves two common and vexing problems encountered in optical heterodyne detection. First, heterodyne signals are beat frequencies between the signal source and a reference source (dubbed local oscillator). They are not DC light levels but oscillating signals and thus unlike conventional detectors the light flux from the signal cannot be integrated on a capacitor. Therefore, to have an array of pixels, each pixel must be backed by AC amplifier and detection circuit which is complex. With Synthetic array detection, all the signals can be amplified and detected by the same circuit. The second problem Synthetic array detection solves arrises, not in pixel imaging but, when the signal is not spatially coherent across the surface of the detector. In this case, the beat frequencies arising are differently phased across the detector surface and these destructively interfere producing a low signal output. In synthetic array detection, each region of the detector has a different fundamental for its beat frequency and thus there is no stationary interference even if the signal's phase varies across the surface of the detector. == Illustration of the concept == Figure 1 shows a particular implementation format of the Synthetic Array method. This implementation is called \\"Rainbow Heterodyne Detection\\" because the local oscillator has its frequencies spread out like a rainbow across the surface of the detector. The output from the detector is a multi-frequency signal. If this output signal is spectrally resolved then each different electrical frequency corresponds to a different location on the detector. ==ImplementationKey difficulties=== While the concept is simple, there is a key difficulty that must be overcome by any implementation: how to generate a rainbow of spread optical frequencies whose bandwidth of difference frequencies with respect to the detector is less than the electrical bandwidth of the detector. That is to say, a typical detector might have a bandwidth on the scale of 100Megahertz. If the biggest difference frequency is œâ6-œâ6 then this difference need to be smaller than 100 Megahertz. This in turn means the spacing between the adjacent difference frequencies must be less than 100Mhz and on average less than 100Mhz/number of pixels. To see why this presents a problem consider dispersing white light with a prism. For any finite size prism you cannot get enough dispersion to create resolved (non-overlapping beamlets) that differ by less than a megahertz. Thus dispersion methods cannot disperse a broadband light source to create the frequency shifted beamlets with narrowly spaced difference frequencies, One possible way to achieve this is to have a separate laser source for every beamlet; these sources must be precisely frequency controlled so their center frequencies are separated by the desired shifts. The primary problem with this is practical: The bandwidth and frequency drift of most lasers is much greater than 1 Mhtz. The lasers needed for this must be of sufficiently narrow spectral purity that they can interfere coherently with the signal source. Even so, having multiple narrow band precision frequency-tuned lasers is also complex. ===Acousto-optic solution=== One practical way to achieve this is to use an Acousto Optic Deflector. These devices deflect an incoming light beam in proportion to the Acoustic driving frequency. They also have the side effect of shifting the output optical frequency by the acoustic frequency. Thus when one of these is driven with multiple acoustic frequencies a series of deflected beams are emitted each with a small and different shift in the optical frequency. Conveniently, this works even if the source laser has low spectral purity since every sub-spectral component of the beamlet is mutually phase coherent with the source and shifted by the same frequency. In particular this approach allows the use of inexpensive, high power or pulsed lasers as sources because no frequency control is required. Figure 2 shows a simple 2 \\"pixel\\" version of this implementation. A laser beam is deflected by a 25Mhz and a 29Mhz acoustic frequency via an acousto-optic modulator. Two beams emerge and both are combined on the detector along with the original laser beam. The 25Mhz beamlet illuminates the left half of the detector while the 29Mhz beamlet illuminates the right half of the detector. The beat frequencies against the signal beam on the detector produce 25 and 29 MHz output frequencies. Thus we can differentiate which photons hit the left or right half of the detector. This method scales to larger numbers of pixels since AOD's with thousands of resolvable spots (each with a different frequency) are commercially available. 2D arrays can be produced with a second AOD arranged at right angles, or by holographic methods. ===Multiplex=== The method multiplexes all the spatial positions on the detector by frequency. If frequencies are uniformly spaced then a simple fourier transform recovers the coherent image. However, there is no reason the frequencies have to be uniformly spaced so one can adjust the number, size and shape of the pixels dynamically. One can also independently change the Heterodyne gain on each pixel individually simply by making the LO beamlet more or less strong. Thus one can extend the dynamic range of the receiver by lowering the gain on bright pixels, raising it on dim ones, and possibly using larger pixels for dim regions. ==Comparison to traditional pixel arrays== The multiplex technique does introduce two limitations as well. In the case of imaging, the signals must not be changing faster than the Nyquist time constant implied by the difference frequency between adjacent pixels. If it does do the pixels blur or alias. (For non-imaging applications‚Äîsuch as when one is simply trying to collect more light but is limited by the spatial incoherence‚Äîthat aliasing is not important since it doesn't change the incoherent sum of the pixels.) Additionally, when one is working near the shot noise limit the multiplex approach can raise the noise floor since all of the pixels see the shot noise from the whole array (since they all are connected by the same wire). (Again for non-imaging applications this may not be important). ==References Category:Optoelectronics Category:Photonics ","title":"Rainbow heterodyne detection"},{"id":"20196765","text":"A vintage-inspired clothing display at Pure London 2015 Pure London is the United Kingdom's leading fashion trade show which takes place twice a year in Olympia, London.

He went to Nottingham Technical College (which eventually became Nottingham Trent University), leaving in 1941. In 1941, aged 17, Scott joined the Met Office, later joining the Royal Air Force and serving at RAF stations in Sullom Voe in Shetland, Malta and North Africa during and after World War II. In the 1950s and 1960s he worked at RAF Watnall (now called the Nottingham Weather Centre), and in Nairobi, Kenya, and at RAF Uxbridge. ==Broadcasting== Jack Scott made his television debut in May 1969 as the BBC's twentieth weather forecaster; he stayed with them until his retirement in 1983. As Scott was employed by the Civil Service rather than the BBC, when he left the BBC and the Met Office in 1983 aged 60, he was able to draw a Civil Service pension.'The Times' obituary 14 November 2008 He went on to work for the ITV company Thames Television (1983 - 1988) and was a presenter of Channel 4's magazine programme for the over 60s, Years Ahead, from 1988 to 1989. He also made regular appearances on Pebble Mill at One discussing weather-related topics and presented a series called Under the Weather. Described by the BBC as a \\"pioneer\\", Scott introduced the famous magnetic symbols to viewers in 1975, which could sometimes slip or fall off during broadcasts. He also helped lay the foundations of the computerised system of forecasting used today.BBC Press Release 12 November 2008 Mark Byford, the BBC's Deputy Director-General, praised Scott's \\"wonderful gift of authority and knowledge matched by a warm and accessible style.\\" ==Personal life== Jack was married to Marrion (who died in 2000) and had two sons, David (who survived him) and Jonathan, who died in a climbing accident in the Himalayas.

The work, subtitled \\"a musical journey in 15 stations\\", centers on the life and writings of Simone Weil and was conceived in the Passion Play tradition with episodes in her life linked to the Stations of the Cross. It is composed for SATB chorus, soprano soloist, spoken voice, orchestra and electronic instruments. ==Performance history== La Passion de Simone was commissioned jointly by the New Crowned Hope festival in Vienna, the Barbican Centre, the Los Angeles Philharmonic, and the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts. It had its world premiere on 26 November 2006 at the Jugendstiltheater in Vienna as part of Peter Sellars' New Crowned Hope festival. The world premiere performers were the Klangforum Wien orchestra conducted by Susanna M√§lkki; the Arnold Schoenberg Choir conducted by Erwin Ortner; Finnish soprano as the narrator; as the silent dancer (a directorial addition by Sellars), and Dominique Blanc as the voice of Simone Weil. The work had its United Kingdom premiere at the Barbican Centre, London in July 2007 and its US premiere in August 2008 at the Lincoln Center, New York City, as part of the Mostly Mozart Festival. Unlike previous performances, the French premiere at the Op√©ra Bastille in June 2009 was performed without Sellars' staging. Nevertheless, Dawn Upshaw, for whom the role of the narrator was originally written, performed in all three premieres. ==Chamber version == The composer created a chamber version of the piece. It is the same length as the original version and the soloist's vocal line and the spoken text are unchanged. The orchestration is for 19 musicians and uses no electronic elements. Four solo voices replace the SATB chorus. This version was premiered on 14 November 2013 at the P.O. Hviezdoslav City Theatre in Bratislava, in the framework of the Melos-Ethos Festival for Contemporary Music, in a production conceived and realized by the French music theatre company La Chambre aux √©chos.

He began riding professionally in late 1948 and earned his first win in 1949 at Garden State Park then went on to win that year's riding championship at Monmouth Park Racetrack. He repeated as the leading jockey at Monmouth Park in 1953, 1955, and 1956. The winner of numerous important races, Boulmetis won the Arlington Classic twice and the prestigious Washington, D.C. International Stakes and Canadian International Stakes, forerunners to the Breeders' Cup races which drew the best horses to the United States and Canada from around the world. For owner Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney, he rode Fisherman in the 1956 Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp Racecourse in Paris, France. Among the other notable horses he rode was Hall of Fame inductee Tosmah with whom he won seven stakes races. In the 1955 Massachusetts Handicap, Boulmetis rode Helioscope to a track record time of 2:01 for 1¬º miles on dirt, unbroken as of 2008. Throughout his career Sam Boulmetis raced primarily at tracks on the East Coast of the United States. He retired from riding after the 1966 season and in 1969 was appointed a steward at Monmouth Park Racetrack in Oceanport, New Jersey. He retired in 2004 from his duties as a racing official and state steward for the State of New Jersey.

It was released for the Nintendo DS in Japan on August 6, 2009. == Gameplay == Blood of Bahamut is an action role-playing game in which up to four players battle giant beasts that are featured on both screens of the DS. In order to defeat a giant, players must first destroy its protective armor, then attack its \\"core,\\" and finally attack its other body parts. The giants can summon smaller beasts, which the players must battle simultaneously. Defeating a giant's body parts and the smaller beasts will grant players \\"materials\\" which can be used to produce powerful weapons. The game will contain over 130 missions. == Plot == The game is set in a city built on the back of a great beast known as a Gigant. The city suddenly comes under attack and protagonists Ibuki and Yui must defend it as well as other cities that were built on Gigants that are awakening. The story features seven main characters in total. The Gigants are sentient, and will also attempt to defend themselves, taking part in battles. The Gigants include Bahamut, Ifrit, Shiva, Fenrir, and Gilgamesh, many of which are also summon monsters depicted in Square Enix's popular Final Fantasy series. === Characters === *: The male main protagonist armed with a sword. He is a summoner with the power of the White Dragon residing in his body. *: Female main protagonist and Gigant-clan member who wields a cane staff. *: Commander of the Ifrit clan, uses a battle axe. *: Fenrir clan elder, wields a spear. * Broke from the Shiva clan to travel the world as a 'free spirit', wields a handheld cannon. *: Another Gigant clan swordsman. Wields a samurai's katana. *: Knight of unknown origins, wields a greatsword. == Development == Blood of Bahamut was directed by Motomu Toriyama, who previously worked on numerous other Square Enix titles including Bahamut Lagoon, a tactical role-playing game for the Super Famicom. Before its official announcement, the trademarking of Blood of Bahamut prompted rumours of a connection to Bahamut Lagoon. Such a connection has not been confirmed or denied by Square Enix. Blood of Bahamut was produced by Eisuke Yokoyama, who recently worked on Final Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings. The team stated that their goal was to \\"[...] cross the limits of the DS with a dynamic feel and with a direct sense of control.\\" The game's music is composed by Naoshi Mizuta. The official soundtrack was released in Japan on August 12, 2009. Ignition Entertainment attempted to license the game to bring it overseas to the North American market; however, Square Enix declined the offer. Ignition's Shane Bettenhausen elaborated, \\"We just contacted them and they weren‚Äôt interested in licensing it. That was the kind of deal where they [Square Enix] were probably not going to publish it here so it was worth a shot.\\" == Reception == Famitsu gave Blood of Bahamut a score of 31 out of 40. The game sold 66,000 copies the month of its release. Sales of the game reached about 89,193 copies by the end of 2009.

This fresh water was transported from the Chapultepec springs. Two aqueducts following the same route from the springs were built by the Aztecs during the 15th century, the first destroyed by flooding and the second by the Spanish. After the Spanish conquest a colonial aqueduct was built, the ruins of which are located near Metro Sevilla. ==Original Chapultepec aqueduct== The water level under Tenochtitlan was only 4‚Äì5 feet below the city, however, it was not a viable source of freshwater as the water retrieved was brackish. Shallow wells were constructed, and the water retrieved was used for household work. Construction of an aqueduct that brought fresh water, suitable for cooking and drinking, from Chapultepec springs to Tenochtitlan began in 1418. Building relied on mud and plant material to create the foundation, which rested on artificial islands that were spread 3 to 4 meters apart. Mounds consisting of mud were constructed on these islands and driven through with a wooden stake for support. The top of each mound had a hollowed out trough lined with compacted clay, and hollowed out logs were placed in the bottom of the flow path to bridge gaps between the islands. A wooden plank walkway flanked the aqueduct, making it easily accessible and a method of transportation from the city to the outlying areas. Once the water reached the city, it was delivered to small reservoirs and select households through a network of canals that extended in the four cardinal directions and branched off to individual streets. Despite its relative longevity, the composition of the aqueduct could not withstand the forces of nature. Erosion weathered away the compacted clay, and in 1449, heavy rains triggered a flood that destroyed the aqueduct and effectively shut down Tenochtitlan for weeks. ==Second Chapultepec aqueduct== After the destruction of the original aqueduct, the king of Texcoco, Nezahualcoyotl, ordered the construction of another water system using sturdier materials following the same route as the original. This aqueduct consisted of two mortar lined troughs made of stone masonry. The addition of the second trough allowed for water to be diverted to the second pipe when maintenance had to be performed on the other. This allowed for a continuous supply of fresh water to be delivered to the city. Like the original aqueduct, the second rested on a chain of artificial islands. The pipes were secured to the islands by wood pilings attached to a foundation of sand, lime, and rock. The aqueduct was constructed using wood, carved stone, and compacted soil, with portions made of hollowed logs, allowing canoes to travel underneath. ==Colonial aqueduct== Replica of the Salto del Agua Fountain.After his arrival in the Aztec empire, Hernan Cortes discovered the economic and political importance of the Chapultepec aqueduct. He took advantage of the city's dependence on the aqueduct and blocked the fresh water supply, eventually destroying it. Shortly after the Spanish conquest, he set about dividing the land among the conquistadors. He wanted to take the forest of Chapultepec for himself, but Charles V, King of Spain, denied his request and decreed that the springs were needed to provide the people with potable water and were thereby the property of the city of Tenochtitlan. Construction of a new aqueduct started under the reigning Viceroy Fernando de Alencastre, 1st Duke of Linares (1711-1716). The structure became known under another name as the Aqueduct of Belen, named after an old Belen convent it passed by. Built along the same path as the Aztec engineered aqueducts, it was constructed using Roman architecture, reflected in its 904 arches. In completion, it reached a total length of 4663 varas, roughly 4 kilometers. In conquest times, the aqueduct supplied the city with the majority of its freshwater, however, waterborne illness was a concern. In an effort to reduce the possibility of external contamination, iron and lead pipes were installed to replace the open troughs during the 19th Century. These shielded the water from air and outside contaminants but did not decrease the number of pathogen related illnesses and death. Located on Chapultepec Avenue near Metro Sevilla, a small section, about twenty-two arches long, still survives today. Also standing today are two fountains associated with the aqueduct. The first is found wedged between Chapultepec Park and Metro Chapultepec. Constructed by the viceroy Agust√≠n de Ahumada, this fountain was designed to divert a water to this section of the city. It also served a decorative and historical purpose. However, it is no longer in its original location: it was restored, enlarged and moved to its current location by Roberto Alvarez Espinoza in 1921. The second fountain, Salto del Agua, was built at the intersection of Eje Central and Arcos de Belen Street, where the historic center meets Colonia Doctores and Colonia Obrera. While it is at the original location, it is not the original fountain. It had deteriorated badly, and a reproduction was made by Guillermo Ruiz. The original are on display at the Museo Nacional del Virreinato in Tepotzotl√°n. ==References== Category:Aqueducts in Mexico Category:Landmarks in Mexico City Category:Buildings and structures in Mexico City Category:Buildings and structures in Mesoamerica Category:Aztec sites Category:Aztec science and technology Category:Tenochtitlan ","title":"Chapultepec aqueduct"},{"id":"20196958","text":"Chaudandi is a village development committee in Udayapur District in the Sagarmatha Zone of south-eastern Nepal.

At the beginning of the 20th century, Sarakaev completed his education in the city of Vladikavkaz and left in 1902 to the city of Tiflis. There he began his literary and journalistic career, working in the widely known and popular magazine Caucasus. In 1907, Ibragim-Bek Sarakaev moved to Vladikavkaz and got a job in the newspaper Terek (the then- visible revolutionary Sergey Kirov worked there also). Those years he had written \\"Nohcho\\", \\"Chechen\\", \\"Vedanho\\" and many other stories which were only published in 1911‚Äì14. He also has more than 30 materials on the Chechen Republic that discuss problems of refereeing, culture and formation development, in which it openly criticised lawlessness and an arbitrariness made by representatives of the power. Stories and such large historic- philosophical researches such as Mjuridizm, Court and Execution of Shamil and others were published as well, and under his own surname. In the same years in Vladikavkaz, two large is art-documentary works of Ibragim-Beka Sarakaeva have been printed: in 1913, the book On Slums of the Chechen Republic, and in 1914, The Chechen Republic and Capture of Shamil. They were the first books in the history of the Chechen Republic, truthfully written by the Chechen about the life of the people. In those books, the literary skill of Ibragim-Bek Sarakaeva especially showed. After the beginning of the First World War, Sarakaev registered in the Wild division. For courage shown in fights on southwest front, Ibragim-Bek was promoted to officer, and then further served as a lieutenant colonel. He was awarded with Sacred George's awards of IV degree and Sacred Anna of II degree with swords. ==In the Soviet Republic== In 1914 Ibragim-Bek Sarakaev left for war and wrote and sketched his own stories, but was dissatisfied with their quality and he seldom set them into print. For last 20 years of his life of Ibragim-Bek Sarakaev has been written a little. After the revolution of 1917, he served as the official under special commissions in the Mountain Government. In the days of the civil war, under Kirov's recommendation, Sarakaev served in the well-known XI Red Army as the vice-commander on supply. After a victory of the Soviet power in the Chechen Republic, he became the deputy chief of militia of the Chechen region. The people's Commissariat of Internal Affairs was pursued, but died a natural death in 1934. He is buried in native village Vedeno. ==References * Category:1883 births Category:1934 deaths Category:Chechen writers Category:Russian people of Chechen descent Category:Chechen people ","title":"Ibragim-Bek Sarakaev"},{"id":"20197038","text":"Khanbu is a populated place located in Triyuga municipality of Udayapur District in Province No. 1 of Nepal.

IPD combines ideas from integrated practice and lean construction. The objectives of IPD are to increase productivity, reduce waste(waste being described as resources spent on activities that does not add value to the end product), avoid time overruns, enhance final product quality, and reduce conflicts between owner(s), architect(s) and contractor(s) during construction. IPD emphasizes the use of technology to facilitate communication between these parties involved in a construction process. == Background == The construction industry has suffered from a productivity decline since the 1960s while all other non-farm industries have seen large boosts in productivity. Proponent of Intergrated project delivery argue that problems in contemporary construction, such as buildings that are behind schedule and over budget, are due to adverse relations between the owner, general contractor, and architect. Using ideas developed by Toyota in their Toyota Production System and computer technology advances,the new focus in IPD is the final value created for the owner. In essence, IPD sees all allocation of resources for any activity that does not add value to the end product (the finished building) as wasteful. == IPD in practice == In Practice, the IPD system is a process where all disciplines in a construction project work as one firm. The primary team members include the architect, key technical consultants as well as a general contractor and subcontractors. The growing use of building information modeling in the construction industry is allowing for easier sharing of information between project participants using IPD and considered a tool to increasing productivity throughout the construction process. Unlike the design‚Äìbuild project delivery method which typically places the contractor in the leading role on a building project, IPD represents a return to the \\"master builder\\" concept where the entire building team including the owner, architect, general contractor, building engineers, fabricators, and subcontractors work collaboratively throughout the construction process. == Multi-Party Agreements == One common way to further the goals of IPD is through a multi-party agreement among key participants. In a multi-party agreement (MPA), the primary project participants execute a single contract specifying their respective roles, rights, obligations, and liabilities. In effect, the multi-party agreement creates a temporary virtual, and in some instances formal, organization to realize a specific project. Because a single agreement is used, each party understands its role in relationship to the other participants. Compensation structures are often open-book, so each party‚Äôs interests and contributions are similarly transparent. Multi-party agreements require trust, as compensation is tied to overall project success and individual success depends on the contributions of all team members. Common forms of multi-party agreements include * project alliances, which create a project structure where the owner guaranteed the direct costs of non- owner parties, but payment of profit, overhead and bonus depends on project outcome; * a single-purpose entity, which is a temporary, but formal, legal structure created to realize a specific project; * and relational contracts, which are similar to Project Alliances in that a virtual organization is created from individual entities, but it differs in its approach to compensation, risk sharing and decision making. == The role of technology in IPD == The adoption of IPD as a standard for collaborative good practice on construction projects presents its own problems. As most construction projects involve disparate stakeholders, traditional IT solutions are not conducive to collaborative working. Sharing files behind IT firewalls, large email attachment sizes and the ability to view all manner of file types without the native software all make IPD difficult. The need to overcome collaborative IT challenges has been one of the drivers behind the growth of online construction collaboration technology. Since 2000, a new generation of technology companies evolved using SaaS to facilitate IPD. This collaboration software streamlines the flow of documentation, communications and workflows ensuring everyone is working from 'one version of the truth'. Collaboration software allows users from disparate locations to keep all communications, documents & drawings, forms and data, amongst other types of electronic file, in one place. Version control is assured and users are able to view and mark up files online without the need for native software. The technology also enables project confidence and mitigates risk thanks to inbuilt audit trails. == Criticism == A significant criticism of IPD is the absence of any mention or effort to integrate project safety and employee well-being into the method. Excluding concerns for employees will likely lead to poor safety performance on projects using IPD, and increase stress levels among construction workers. == Job Order Contracting == Job Order Contracting, JOC is form of integrated project delivery that specifically targets repair, renovation, and minor new construction. It has proven to be capable of delivering over 90% of projects on-time, on-budget, and to the satisfaction of the owner, contractors, and customer alike. ==See also== * Building information modeling * Lean construction * Patrick MacLeamy - the inventor of MacLeamy Curve ==ReferencesSelected articles on integrated project delivery=== *2017 NIBS Delivering Better Facilities through Lean Construction and Owner Leadership *Integrated Project Delivery: A Platform for Efficient Construction BuildingGreen, November 1, 2008 *Another look: Is IPD the solution?

In 1934, the couple left New York City for Winhall in rural Vermont, where they had purchased a rather large forest tract for $2200 and a moderate-sized farm for $2500. They aspired to live a more ‚Äúpurposeful‚Äù life and improve their health while disassociating from modern society. At the homestead, they lived a largely ascetic and self-reliant life, growing much of their own food and putting up nine stone buildings over the course of two decades. Cash was earned from producing maple syrup and maple sugar from the trees on their land and from Scott Nearing's occasional paid lectures.Nearing, The Making of a Radical, p. 47.

After 395 the Roman Empire splits in two. In the East, Greeks are the predominant national group and their language is the lingua franca of the region. Christianity is the official religion of this new Empire, spread to the region by the Greek language, the language in which the first gospels were written. The language of the aristocracy however remains Latin, until gradually replaced by Greek by 7th century. The East Roman Empire retained its status as the power at least in the Mediterranean world until the 12th century. Amongst its achievements is the spread of Christianity to Eastern Europe and the Slavs, halting the Persian, Slavic and Arab expansions towards Europe and preserving a vast amount of the cultural heritage of Greek- Roman Antiquity.

There are five basic positions in modern-day classical ballet, known as the first through fifth positions. In 1725, dancing master Pierre Rameau credited the codification of these five positions to choreographer Pierre Beauchamp. Two additional positions, known as the sixth and seventh positions, were codified by Serge Lifar in the 1930s while serving as Ballet Master at the Paris Op√©ra Ballet, though their use is limited to Lifar's choreographies. The sixth and seventh positions were not Lifar's inventions, but revivals of positions that already existed in the eighteenth century, when there were ten positions of the feet in classical ballet. ==Five basic positions== The first basic position requires the feet to be flat on the floor and turned out (pointing in opposite directions as a result of rotating the legs at the hips). ===First position=== First position Heels together, and toes going outwards. ===Second position=== Second position The feet point in opposite directions, with heels spaced approximately twelve inches apart. ===Third position=== Third position One foot is placed in front of the other so that the heel of the front foot is near the arch. ===Fourth position=== Open fourth position, with heels lined up, one directly in front of the other Closed fourth position, with heel of each foot overlapping the toe of the other foot There are two types of fourth position: open and closed. In both cases, one foot is placed approximately twelve inches in front of the other. In open fourth position the heels are aligned, while in closed fourth position the heel of the front foot is aligned with the toe of the back foot. ===Fifth position=== Fifth position Fifth position should form two parallel lines with your feet. The heel of the front foot should be in contact with the big toe of the other, and the heel of the back foot should be in contact with the last toe of the front foot. ==Lifar's additional positionsSeventh position=== Seventh position Similar to fourth position, but performed en pointe with heels in center with each other. There are two seventh positions, determined by whether the left or right foot is placed in front. ==ReferencesSee also== *Positions of the arms in ballet Ballet, feet Category:Ballet technique Category:Human positions ","title":"Positions of the feet in ballet"},{"id":"20197092","text":"The Honourable Evelyn Hubbard (18 March 1852 ‚Äì 24 August 1934) was a British businessman and Conservative politician.

The moshav poalim was an attempt to combine farming and urban labor. In addition to working in the city, families received land for tending small kitchen gardens. The moshav poalim differed in approach from the moshav ovdim: It was not based on collective ideology or settling national land. The experiment failed because the kitchen gardens did not generate sufficient income.

Adil al-Ghanim, known by the kunya Abu Mu'adh al-Kuwaiti, was the commander of the fighters who entered the city, although he did not engage in combat himself. While observing the mission from atop a nearby hill, he was shot and killed. A Saudi commander from Medina who was greatly disturbed by the ongoing Srebrenica massacre of Bosnian Muslims, Abu Omar al-Harbi led a six-man team whose goal was to capture three Bosnian Serb bunkers. However, the first bunker sat in front of an open field which didn't offer any cover to the team, and the Serbs immediately began firing on them as they struggled to get their rocket-propelled grenade in position. al-Harbi began sprinting across the open field towards the bunker, shooting at the two Serbs inside. His team shouted to warn him that he could be entering a minefield, but his only response was to shout Allahu Akbar loudly before carrying on. He killed one of the Serbs from a distance of approximately two metres in front of the bunker before he was shot in the forehead and killed.Azzam Publishers, In the Hearts of Green Birds, 1997 During a \\"sabotage attack\\" led by Abu Sabit Masri against Serb foxholes, approximately three military police were killed and the severed head of Momir Mitroviƒá was collected and brought back along with his identification and diary.ICTY Transcripts, p. 5671 onward, November 16, 2007 A Serbian tank was captured by Bosniak forces, who sent a radio message for al-Battar al-Yemeni, a former tank commander from the Army of Yemen, to return to the battlefield following his removal after being wounded in the hand. As Serb troops tried to destroy the captured vehicle, al-Yemeni and an unknown companion ran towards it and drove it back to the Bosnian lines. He was killed by a mortar shell four hours later while trying to evacuate a wounded fighter from a captured bunker. Krsto Marinkoviƒá, of the Serbian Light Brigade, was woken up in his unit's trench by shouts of coming under attack from the Bosnians. Together with Petko Mariƒá, he ran towards the forests in an attempt to escape the attack, where they met Velibor To≈°iƒá, and at 19:00 the trio decided to surrender themselves to the Mujahideen, in the hopes of being exchanged for Bosnian prisoners. After stepping out of the forest, they were surrounded quickly by both Bosnian and foreign Mujahideen, who kicked and punched them before making a brief video showcasing their prisoners, and entrusted them to a Bosnian and two Mujahideen who began marching them towards Livade.ICTY transcript, October 3 2007 ==The prisonersHeld in Livade cabin=== The captured soldiers, with the exception of Predag Kne≈æeviƒá who was allegedly beheaded, were taken to Livade village. A memo was written the following day, from the Military Security Service of the ABiH 35th Division, informing the 3rd Corps commander that the prisoners had been interviewed in the \\"Reception Centre\\" in Livade, and that they suggested that Sare, a reference to Edin Sariƒá, should conduct any future interrogation.

Marinkoviƒá tried to escape at one point, but simply fell off the back of the truck still blindfolded and bound, and a burst from a Mujahideen machine gun made him freeze. A knife was held to his throat, and the Bosnian asked the captured doctor, Branko Sikaniƒá, to come over and slit his throat, which Sikaniƒá refused - and the convoy carried on. When they arrived, they were untied and fed fish, bread and water. Two soldiers from the 35th Division had heard of the capture and showed up at the two-story house where the prisoners were held, where they claim that they asked the foreign fighter to untie them, but were ignored.Institute for War & Peace Reporting, Conflicting Evidence in Delic Trial, October 12, 2007 The following day, 40-year-old prisoner Gojko Vujiƒçiƒá, who had been wounded in the right thigh, swore blasphemous curses while demanding water to be given to him, and was subsequently taken to another room where he was shot and decapitated.

Troy Kinney writes that One-Step originated from the Turkey Trot dance, with all mannerisms of the latter removed, so that \\"of the original 'trot' nothing remains but the basic step\\".Troy Kinney, Margaret West Kinney (1914) \\"The Dance: Its Place in Art and Life\\" (public domain, digitized by Google) The One-Step included the following basic figures (and a number of more advanced ones): *The Castle Walk (invented and introduced by Mr. and Mrs. Vernon Castle). *The Turn is a walking step, pivoting on one foot to change direction. The right foot comes from the preceding step to the place of starting; while it makes two successive long steps the left foot turns ‚Äúon its place‚Äù. The turn's completion brings the right foot into anterior fourth position. The woman's steps are the converse of the man's, her left foot making the long steps, while her right foot turns on its place. The turn gains smoothness by means of allowing the right knees to touch each other lightly. *The Dip. Starting with (say) the right foot in posterior fourth position: during the first beat, sink; on the second beat, rise, transferring the weight to the left (advanced) foot, gliding the right foot up to third position, on arriving at which it instantly receives the weight again, if the dip is to be repeated. In that case the left foot again glides to anterior fourth position, and the step is effected as before. Frequently several dips are made in succession. They often succeed a turn, the latter's finish leaving the feet in appropriate (fourth) position for the purpose. The dip is executed in any direction, with the performers in any position of the couple. It occurs in other dances, but its technique is always the same. *The Grapevine *The One-Step Eight, so called from the number of beats it occupies, is a simple walk, with turn. The man's steps are the converse of the woman's; she pivots on her right foot, he on his left foot. Executed in closed position of the couple. *The Square, originally a Tango figure, is equally effective in the One-Step.

Designed for \\"emerging markets\\" in countries such as Brazil, Mexico, India and China, the Zeebo system (or \\"Zeebo\\") runs videogames and other interactive content delivered via wireless 3G digital distribution. This approach is intended to thwart piracy and reduce the cost of content. The system also enables wireless Internet access for web browsing, email and social networking. The Zeebo was sold throughout Brazil and Mexico, and the company has discussed the possibility of future product introductions elsewhere in Latin America, in India, China and Russia. == Founding == By the company's own account, the initial idea for the Zeebo system occurred independently to Reinaldo Normand, who was then at Tectoy Mobile (a division of the Brazilian consumer electronics company Tectoy), and Mike Yuen, senior director of games and services at Qualcomm. Normand sought backers for the project in the United States, and helped formed a small U.S.-based division of Tectoy, called Tectoy of America, in 2007. He then met Yuen, and the two discovered that they were pursuing similar concepts. During that time Mike Yuen was working with Dave Durnil, Director of Engineering at Qualcomm who designed and built the first working prototype of a 3G wireless gaming and entertainment console. Qualcomm decided to fund the project, and Tectoy of America became Zeebo Inc. in March, 2008. Normand joined the executive staff and was given responsibility for worldwide special projects. Dave Durnil became an engineering advisor for Zeebo Inc. Yuen left Qualcomm and was named Zeebo's senior vice president of content and services in August, 2009. He served as president and CEO. == Product Launch == The company introduced the Zeebo in limited quantities in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on June 1, 2009, with manufacturing and distribution provided by Tectoy. The system went on sale nationwide in Brazil in November the same year. In December, 2009, the Zeebo went on sale nationwide in Mexico. == Organization and Partnerships == Zeebo Inc. had its headquarters in San Diego, California with offices in S√£o Paulo, Brazil, Mexico City, Mexico and Shanghai, China. Zeebo marketing and development in Brazil are carried out by Zeebo Brasil, Zeebo Inc.'s Brazilian subsidiary. Marketing and development in Mexico was carried out by the Mexican subsidiary Zeebo Mexico. Manufacturing and distribution were provided by regional partners such as Tectoy in Brazil. Wireless bandwidth was provided by telecommunications partners such as Claro in Brazil and Telcel in Mexico. Zeebo also announced an agreement with AT&T; in March, 2010. The company has stated that \\"The agreement gives us access to AT&T;'s international roaming network, allowing us to carry out rapid trials of the Zeebo platform in new geographic areas as we establish longer-term agreements with local carriers for deployment of the system. It will also give us a chance to explore opportunities in the US market in the future.\\" In June, 2010, it was reported that Zeebo Inc. raised $13.5 million in its latest round of venture funding. == References  External links == * Corporate Website (Archive) Category:Video game publishers Category:Companies based in San Diego Category:Video game development companies Category:Multinational companies headquartered in the United States Category:American companies established in 2007 Category:American companies disestablished in 2014 Category:Video game companies established in 2007 Category:Video game companies disestablished in 2014 Category:Defunct video game companies of the United States Category:Defunct companies based in California Category:2007 establishments in California Category:2014 disestablishments in California ","title":"Zeebo Inc."},{"id":"20197514","text":"Rick Fisher is an American lighting designer, known for his work with Stephen Daldry on Billy Elliot the Musical and An Inspector Calls.

Cordell, Gwendolyn F.M. Kestrel, and Jeff Quick, and was released in October 2003 published by Wizards of the Coast. Cover art was by Sam Wood, with interior art by Kalman Andrasofszky, Matt Cavotta, Mike Dubisch, Wayne England, Matt Faulkner, Vance Kovacs, Vince Locke, Raven Mimura, Jim Pavelec, Vinod Rams, Richard Sardinha, Stephen Tappin, and Joel Thomas. When asked how the designers dealt sorting through years' worth of publications on the Underdark to create a more definitive sourcebook, Jeff Quick responded: \\"I was the editor of Eric Boyd's exhaustively detailed 2nd edition sourcebook, Drizzt Do'Urden's Guide to the Underdark. Eric, as Forgotten Realms fans know, is a detail nut. When he wrote it, he consulted pretty much every Underdark reference ever -- including Bob Salvatore, personally. So rather than duplicate effort, I turned to that book for inspiration and to Eric for a few details and opinions.\\" ==Reception== The editor from rpgnews.com stated the book did not deliver on the price it costs, was incomplete, contained a lot of assumed information making it difficult for casual readers to understand references without knowledge of the novels; however, fans of the novels might enjoy it. ==ReviewsReferences * Underdark Forgotten Realms Campaign Supplement at Wizards of the Coast Category:2003 books Category:Forgotten Realms sourcebooks ","title":"Underdark (supplement)"},{"id":"20197576","text":"Natalia Oreiro is the self-titled debut Spanish-language album by Uruguayan singer and actress Natalia Oreiro. == Background == Due to a big success of a song Que si, que si from the movie Un Argentino en New York, Natalia Oreiro was offered collaboration with music company BMG Argentina to make her own CD.

Green (July 1940 - July 24, 2019) was a history professor retired from teaching at Brigham Young University, where he specialized in the modern history of the Middle East, especially the eras of European colonization and of decolonization. == Biography == Green was born in July 1940 and grew up in Arcadia, California, where he attended K‚Äì12 (1945‚Äì57). In 1959 he received an Associate of Arts degree from Citrus Junior College in Azusa. After one year (1959‚Äì60) at Brigham Young University, he served a two-and-a-half-year mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in France, where his assignments included Nantes, Tours, La Rochelle, Troyes, Chatillon, Reims, and Fontenay-aux-Roses. He toured Europe for a month after his release in February 1963. Green returned to school in the summer of 1963. In 1965 he earned a bachelor's degree \\"with honors\\" in American Studies from California State University, Los Angeles, at a time when anti-Vietnam War protests and civil rights marches were growing on U.S. college campuses. Green received a scholarship to seek an MA in History at BYU, where he worked as a TA for Professor Richard L. Bushman and where his professors included De Lamar Jensen, Russel B. Swensen, and Hugh Nibley. The latter two formed the advisory committee for his research thesis on \\"A History of Latter-day Saint Proselytizing Efforts to the Jewish People,\\" a summary article of which appeared in BYU Studies (1968). He received the MA \\"with distinction\\" late in the spring of 1967. With his wife and infant daughter, Green returned in the summer of 1967 to Los Angeles, where at UCLA he began pursuing a Ph.D. in modern Near Eastern history/Arabic. His professors included Gustave Von Grunebaum, Nikki Keddie, Stanford Shaw, Afaf Lutfi al-Sayyid Marsot, P. J. Vatikiotis, Louis J. Cantori, Abdallah Laroui, and Peter Von Sivers. He worked during 1969‚Äì70 as a research assistant for Prof. Leo Kuper. A Fulbright-Hays grant funded 18 months of research in France and Tunisia (1970‚Äì72) for the dissertation on The Tunisian Ulama, 1873‚Äì1915: Social Structure and Response to Ideological Currents, which was published by E. J. Brill (Leiden, Netherlands). During 1972‚Äì73, while Andrew Sandler was on sabbatical leave, Green replaced him as a visiting professor at the University of Miami, where he taught courses on the modern Middle East, sub-Saharan Africa, and the Jewish experience. In the fall of 1973, Green embarked on Fulbright‚ÄìHays post- doctoral research scholarship to North Yemen. He anticipated meeting his wife (and their three small children) in Cairo on 6 October 1973, when the \\"Ramadan\\"/\\"Yom Kippur\\" War broke out, stranding Mrs. Green and the children in Beirut and Dr. Green temporarily in Libya and then in Tunisia. They finally reached Yemen, via Rome and Dhahran, a month after leaving Miami. Living in Taiz, Green studied the medieval \\"university\\" town of Zabid. From 1974 to 1985 Green was in the Department of Arabic Studies at the American University in Cairo where he was an assistant professor and, from September 1977, an associate professor of Arab history. Green became a member of the BYU faculty in 1985. He has served as the head of the BYU Jerusalem Center and as chair of the BYU history department. He retired from BYU in 2006. Among books by Green are The Tunisian Ulama, 1873‚Äì1915 (1978), which is his most widely cited work, A Survey of Arab History, coauthored with Bernard Weiss, and In Quest of An Islamic Humanism: Arabic and Islamic studies in memory of Mohamed al-Nowaihi (1984). In the LDS Church, Green served in many callings including as a branch president and a Sunday School president. Besides studies of North Africa and the Middle East, especially their intellectual history, Green has also studied the use of supposed similarities to Islam to attack the Latter-day Saints in 19th Century American thought. His work considering the comparison of Joseph Smith to Mohammad has been often cited.See, for example, and == Sources == * *Muslim online publication article mentioning Green == References == Category:2019 deaths Category:1940 births Category:20th-century Mormon missionaries Category:The American University in Cairo faculty Category:Brigham Young University alumni Category:Brigham Young University faculty Category:California State University, Los Angeles alumni Category:Historians of Tunisia Category:University of California, Los Angeles alumni Category:University of Miami faculty Category:Citrus College people Category:American Mormon missionaries in France Category:American expatriates in Egypt Category:American expatriates in Israel Category:Latter Day Saints from California ","title":"Arnold H.

The Swiftcurrent Auto Camp at Swiftcurrent Lake was created for these new tourists. It includes a rustic general store, built in 1935 by the Glacier Park Hotel Company, surrounded by a number of log tourist cabins., as well as a shower and laundry house and other supporting structures. In contrast to the prominent site of the nearby Many Glacier Hotel, the auto camp is located in stands of mature trees that block direct views of the surrounding mountains. The facilities were intended to provide an inexpensive, informal alternative to the hotels that had heretofore provided the bulk of tourist accommodations.

He was a member of the National Assembly of Quebec from 1979 to 1989, a cabinet minister, and a Justice of the Quebec Superior Court. Herbert Marx was born in Montreal to Robert, a tailor, and Miriam Marx in 1932 and graduated from Baron Byng High School. He was uninterested in school as a youth, preferring to hang out in pool halls, and failed grade 9. He worked selling encyclopedias door-to-door before working in the lighting industry from 1955 to 1965, becoming vice- president of Verd-A-Ray Industries Ltd. He returned to his studies and attended Concordia University (B.A., 1958); Universit√© de Montr√©al (M.A., English Literature); and Harvard Law School (LL.M., 1969). Throughout his law studies, he received a number of prizes. Moreover, he was awarded the Prix du Barreau for having come first in the Quebec Bar Exams in 1968. He was also awarded scholarships by the Quebec and Canadian governments. In 1967 and 1968 he articled in the law firm of Stikeman Elliott in Montreal. He joined the Faculty of Law at the Universit√© de Montr√©al in July 1969. Over the next ten years, he taught constitutional law, civil liberties and poverty law. Between 1969 and 1979, he was a consultant to the Quebec Ministries of Justice, Education and Intergovernmental Affairs as well as to the Canada Law Reform Commission, the Quebec Civil Code Revision Office, the Quebec Gendron Commission on Language Rights and the Montreal Island School Council. He was also a visiting professor at the Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Montr√©al and McGill University Faculty of Law. In 1969, he was a founding member of the Pointe Saint-Charles Legal Aid Clinic in Montreal. He was a Commissioner of the Quebec Human Rights Commission from 1975 to 1979, and a member of the Consultative Committee of the Institute of Intergovernmental Relations at Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario from 1977 to 1982. In 1979, he was elected in a by-election as the member from D'Arcy-McGee to the Quebec National Assembly. He was re-elected in 1981 and 1985. He was Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Quebec from 1985 to 1988 and in addition served variously as solicitor general, minister responsible for consumer protection, and minister of public security. He resigned first as justice minister in late 1988, and six months later as a Member of the National Assembly in protest of the Quebec government's decision to use the notwithstanding clause of the Constitution of Canada to overrride a Supreme Court of Canada ruling that a law banning non-French outdoor signs was unconstitutional. He was appointed a Justice of Quebec Superior Court in 1989 by the federal government and took mandatory retirement in 2007. He was active in a number of non-governmental organizations: Co-chair of the McGill Consortium for Human Rights Advocacy Training; Co-Chair of the McGill Middle East Programme in Civil Society and Peace Building; Governor of Tel Aviv University; President of the Association for Canadian Studies; Member of the Board of the Tolerance Foundation.

The policy must be available on the school's website and posted in every classroom. All Pennsylvania public schools must provide a copy of its anti-bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and shall review their policy every three years. Additionally, the district must conduct an annual review of that policy with students. The Center for Schools and Communities works in partnership with the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives. Education standards relating to student safety and antiharassment programs are described in the 10.3. Safety and Injury Prevention in the Pennsylvania Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education. ===Safe School grant=== In 2013, Line Mountain high School did not participate in a state Safe Schools Targeted Grant. The maximum of $25,000 grants was available through a competitive application process. The funds must be used for research based interventions, like: peer mediation, staff training in managing behavioral issues and creating a positive school climate. The District also did not participate in the state's School Resource Officer and Police Officer grants.Pennsylvania Department of Education, 2013‚Äì14 School Resource Office/School Police Officer Grant Awardees, 2014 ==Wellness policy== Line Mountain School Board established a district Student Wellness Policy in 2006. The policy deals with nutritious meals served at school, the control of access to some foods and beverages during school hours, age appropriate nutrition education for all students, and physical education for students K-12. The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 ‚Äì 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) \\"shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006.\\" Most districts identified the superintendent and school foodservice director as responsible for ensuring local wellness policy implementation. The legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education, physical activity, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus. The Pennsylvania Department of Education required the district to submit a copy of the policy for approval. The Line Mountain Junior Senior High School offers a free school breakfast and free or reduced-price lunch to children in low income families. All students attending the school can eat breakfast and lunch. Children from families with incomes at or below 130 percent of the federal poverty level are provided a breakfast and lunch at no cost to the family. In 2007, the Pennsylvania General Assembly passed legislation that provides a supplemental state reimbursement for each breakfast and lunch served as part of the National School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program. The Food Service provides the monthly menus online and in the local newspaper on a weekly basis. Children from families with incomes between 130 and 185 percent of the federal poverty level can be charged no more than 30 cents per breakfast. A foster child whose care and placement is the responsibility of the State or who is placed by a court with a caretaker household is eligible for both a free breakfast and a free lunch. Runaway, homeless and Migrant Youth are also automatically eligible for free meals.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs ‚Äì Eligibility Manual for School Meals, 2012 The meals are partially funded with federal dollars through the United States Department of Agriculture.Pennsylvania Hunger Action Center, The Pennsylvania School Breakfast Report Card, 2009 In 2013, the USDA issued new restrictions to foods in public schools. The rules apply to foods and beverages sold on all public school district campuses during the day. They limit vending machine snacks to a maximum of 200 calories per item. Additionally, all snack foods sold at school must meet competitive nutrient standards, meaning they must have fruits, vegetables, dairy or protein in them or contain at least 10 percent of the daily value of fiber, calcium, potassium, and Vitamin D.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs, June 27, 2013 In order to comply with the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 all US public school districts are required to raise the price of their school lunches to $2.60 regardless of the actual cost of the lunch. In 2014, President Obama ordered a prohibition of advertisements for unhealthy foods on public school campuses during the school day. The Food and Drug Administration requires that students take milk as their beverage at lunch. In accordance with this law, any student requesting water in place of milk with their lunch must present a written request, signed by a doctor, documenting the need for water instead of milk. Line Mountain Junior Senior High School provides health services as mandated by the Commonwealth and the federal government. Nurses are available in each building to conduct annual health screenings (data reported to the PDE and state Department of Health) and to dispense prescribed medications to students during the school day. Students can be excluded from school unless they comply with all the State Department of Health's extensive immunization mandates. School nurses monitor each pupil for this compliance. Nurses also monitor each child's weight. In 2016, the Pennsylvania Department of Health distributed to each Pennsylvania high school the overdose antidote drug naloxone in a nasal spray. School nurses were also provided with educational materials and training developed by the National Association of School Nurses. The cost was covered by a grant from a private foundation. ==Extracurriculars== Line Mountain School District offers a variety of clubs, activities and sports. The Line Mountain School Board determines eligibility policies to participate in these programs. This includes abiding by the Line Mountain Athletic Department Code of Conduct. Students who are failing two full credit courses are ineligible to participate for one week. If a student is absent for 20 days or more in any semester, the student is deemed ineligible until having attended school for 60 days, beginning after the 20th day of absence.Line Mountain Junior Senior High School Administration, Student Handbook 2013‚Äì14, 2013 According to Pennsylvania's Safety in Youth Sports Act, all sports coaches, paid and volunteer, are required to annually complete the Concussion Management Certification Training and present the certification before coaching. In 2011, Line Mountain School District administration filed a complaint against a former wrestler, whose family had moved to Benton Area School District, in the CSIU16 region. The high school administration successfully denied the student the ability to wrestle in the 2011‚Äì12 season. The student appealed the denial to the District wrestling board of the PIAA. The appeal was lost. Zain Retherford went on to be a standout wrestler at Penn State and a two-time NCAA National Champion. In 2013, a complaint was filed, in federal courts, against the District regarding its wrestling program. The Administration and School Board denied a female student access to the wrestling program. A federal court appeal was sought by the student. U.S. Judge Matthew W. Brann, of the Middle District of Pennsylvania, issued a temporary injunction prohibiting Line Mountain School District from preventing the pupil to register for the team after her parents filed a lawsuit against the school district. The judge went on to grant the plaintiff relief. The School Board repealed their policy to exclude females from the program. The Judge ordered the School Board to pay $70,948 to the plaintiff's attorneys. By Pennsylvania law, all K-12 students in the district, including those who attend a private nonpublic school, cyber charter school, charter school and those homeschooled, are eligible to participate in the extracurricular programs including all athletics. They must meet the same eligibility rules as the students enrolled in the district's schools. The School provides a National Honor Society program for students whose GPA is 90% or higher in 10th through 12th grades. ===Sports=== The District provides a weight room for athletes.Line Mountain School Board, Use of Weight Room, December 13, 2010 Coaches receive compensation as outlined in the teachers' union contract.

Nonconformities can be classified in seriousness multiple ways, though a typical classification scheme may have three to four levels, including critical, serious, major, and minor. While some situations allow \\"nonconformity\\" and \\"defect\\" to be used synonymously, some industries distinguish between the two; a nonconformity represents a failure to meet an intended state and specification, while a defect represents a failure to meet fitness for use/normal usage requirements. This can be seen in the international software engineering standard ISO/IEC 25010 (formerly ISO/IEC 9126), which defines a nonconformity as the nonfulfillment of a requirement and a defect as the nonfulfillment of intended usage requirements. ==Classifying nonconformity== When ensuring quality of a product or a service, classification of a nonconformity is important, as it provides an opportunity to better reduce nonconformity. Many quality management practices will do this using a relatively simple three- or four-level classification system. For example, U.S. federal agencies such as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration have used a simple three-tier system for quality requirements of government-acquired supplies and services: minor, major, and critical nonconformance. However, some industries may develop their own, custom ranking systems. An example from the automotive industry uses a 10-point system for finer granularity, where, for example, a one represents \\"none\\" (no effect), a six \\"moderate\\" (vehicle or item operable, but comfort or convenience items inoperable), and a 10 \\"hazardous without warning\\" (when a potential failure mode affects safe vehicle operation without warning). Regardless of size, these classification schemes exist to help drive discovery and correction of nonconformities (and defects). ==Sources of nonconformity== The causes of nonconformities aren't unlimited and therefore determinable. Common causes for deficiencies to arise include: * poor communication (or miscommunication) * poor documentation (or lack of documentation) * poor or limited training of personnel * poor motivation of personnel * poor quality materials (or lack of appropriate materials) * poor quality tools and equipment (or lack of appropriate tools and equipment) * poor or dysfunctional operating environment == References == Category:ISO standards Category:Pharmaceutical industry Category:Quality management ","title":"Nonconformity (quality)"},{"id":"20197962","text":"The Carlin Act of 1913, sponsored by Rep.

His father, Baruch, came from a family of flour mill owners. His mother, Ryckelle (Rachel) was of rabbinic descent. Yeshurun grew up speaking Yiddish. When he was five, his parents moved to Krasnystaw in East Poland. He left for the British Mandate of Palestine in 1925, against the will of his parents who preferred that he remain in Poland. Initially he worked in construction, dredged swamps and picked fruit; later he worked in a brick factory and for a printer. In 1929, he joined the Haganah, the Jewish militia that later became the Israeli Defense Force. In 1934 he married Pesyah Justman. Their daughter Helit was born in 1942. Yeshurun's family, along with Krasnystaw's 2,000 Jews, were murdered in Belzec extermination camp in today's Poland. == Yeshurun's Poetry == His first book, Al khokhmot drakhim (\\"On the wisdom of roads\\"), was published under his birthname, Yehiel Perlmutter. He changed his name to Avoth Yeshurun in 1948, the night before he was inducted into the Israel Defense Forces. In 1952 Yeshurun published a highly controversial poem, \\"Pesach al Kochim\\", in which he compared the tragedy of the Palestinian refugees with that of the Jewish Holocaust. His subsequent books were Re'em (a combination of the Hebrew words for \\"Thunder\\" and \\"Antelope\\"), 1961, Shloshim Amud (\\"Thirty Pages\\"), 1965, Ze Shem HaSefer (\\"This is the Name of the Book\\"), 1971, HaShever HaSuri-Afrika'i (\\"The Syrian- African Rift\\"), 1974, Kapella Kolot (\\"A Capella of Voices\\"), 1977, Sha'ar Knisa Sha'ar Yetzia (\\"Entrance Gate Exit Gate\\"), 1981, Homograph, 1985, Adon Menucha (\\"Mr. Rest\\"), 1990, and Ein Li Achshav (\\"I Have No Now\\"), 1992. Many of Yeshurun's poems allude to the guilt he felt for having left Europe before the Holocaust, leaving his home and family behind. His poetry is known for its broken phrasing, and combines Yiddish, biblical and modern Hebrew, and slang used by various cultural groups in Israel, including phrases in Arabic, which he often uses ironically in criticism of the marginalization of Arabs and Arabic in Israeli culture. Avoth Yeshurun died in 1992. In 2018, a documentary about Yeshurun called Yeshurun in 6 Chapters by Amichai Chasson premiered in Docaviv International Documentary Film Festival.[Yeshurun in 6 Chapters in docaviv http://www.docaviv.co.il/2018-en/films/yeshurun-in-6-chapters/] == Awards == * In 1967, Yeshurun was awarded the Brenner Prize. * In 1979, he was the co-recipient (jointly with Aharon Appelfeld) of the Bialik Prize for literature. * In 1992, he was awarded the Israel Prize, for Hebrew poetry. == References  Further reading == * *Avoth Yeshurun, The Syrian-African Rift and other Poems.

In 1910, Belgian pilot H√©l√®ne Dutrieu, the first winner, was lifted out of her airplane and carried on the shoulders of the spectators after she landed. It is often difficult to determine who the official winner was, since each temporary leader (e.g. Marie Marvingt in 1911) was referred to in several contemporary records as having \\"won\\" the cup, only to be superseded by the next temporary record. Thus, in various documents, there are several \\"winners\\" recorded for each year, but the formal winners were announced in Femina Magazine. It was first formally awarded to H√©l√®ne Dutrieu on 31 December 1910 for her record-breaking non-stop flight. She won it again for the second time in 1911.

It is adapted from the 1904 novel by the Nobel Prize-winning Sardinian writer Grazia Deledda. It is notable as the only film performance by of the Italian theater star Eleonora Duse. ‚ÄúFilm Threat‚Äôs Top 10 One-Hit Wonders,‚Äù Film Threat, February 8, 2005. Quote: \\"Indeed it was, as Duse would never venture before the cameras again, leaving \\"Cenere\\" as her only film record.\\" ==Plot== Rosalia Derios is an unmarried woman in a small Sardinian village whose lover abandons her before the birth of their son, whom she names Anania. Realizing that she will not be able to raise the child properly, she gives full custody of Anania to her former lover. However, she entrusts the boy with a sacred amulet before she leaves. Anania grows to adulthood and retains possession of the amulet, but he is haunted by his mother‚Äôs absence and tries to locate her. He pushes aside his career prospects and cancels his plans for marriage in order to pursue his search for Rosalia. Anania's search proves successful and he locates his mother but Rosalia cannot take the shock of being reunited with her adult son and kills herself. ‚ÄúGrazia Deledda: Voice of Sardinia,‚Äù Nobel Prize Foundation, September 2, 2002 ==Production== When Eleonora Duse was approached in 1916 to appear in a film adaptation of Cenere, she had been absent from performing on stage for seven years. Duse expressed deep respect for the source material and its potential as a film. She later explained her return to acting in this production by stating: ‚ÄúI have been persuaded to create the character of Rosalia Derios, from the novel by Grazia Deledda, because it seemed to me that in the sorrowful figure of the mother, all sacrifice for her son, a figure moving in an austere and solemn landscape, would assume the total and clear plastic and spiritual significance that the silent theater must force itself to realize.‚Äù ‚ÄúGrazia Deledda‚Äù by Martha King, Google Books Duse co-wrote the screenplay for Cenere with Febo Mari, her director and co-star. The film was shot over a four-month period on locations across Sardinia. Duse initially had hopes for Cenere to open a new career in film acting. But upon seeing the finished film, she was disappointed in both the production and her performance. \\"I made the same mistake that nearly everyone has made,\\" she said after viewing herself on screen. \\"But something quite different is needed. I am too old for it. Isn't it a pity?\\" Duse later wrote to the French singer Yvette Guilbert with the request not to see ‚Äúthat stupid thing, because you‚Äôll find nothing, or almost nothing, of me in that film.‚Äù ==References * Category:1916 films Category:Italian films Category:Italian black-and-white films Category:Italian silent short films Category:Films shot in Sardinia Category:Films based on works by Grazia Deledda ","title":"Cenere"},{"id":"20198148","text":"Dagfinnur Halvdanarson (or Dagfinn Halfdansson), was, around the year 1400, Lawman of the Faroe Islands.

He is a member of the Democratic Party of Oregon, founder of the Bus Project, and served in the Oregon House of Representatives, representing District 47 in east Portland, from 2009 to 2012. He was one of two candidates for Mayor of Portland in 2012 to advance beyond the primary election, but lost to Charlie Hales in the November general election. He served in the 2010 and 2012 legislative sessions, but to facilitate his run for mayor, he did not run for reelection to the House and he vacated his seat after serving four years. ==Early life and career== Smith was born in Portland in 1973 to attorney and former Umatilla County district attorney R. P. Joe Smith and family therapist Suzanne Peck. He was named for U.S. President Thomas Jefferson. He is a great-great- great grandnephew of Joseph Smith, founder of Mormonism. His parents split before his second birthday, and he moved with his mother to South Pasadena, California. He returned to Portland during his seventh-grade year, and later became class president at Grant High School. His mother died of breast cancer when Smith was a teenager. Smith earned a bachelor's degree in political science from the University of Oregon, where he was a member of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity. At his father's insistence, he took a year off during college, serving as a youth counselor in Lane County and then running youth sports programs in Washington, D.C. Smith went on to earn a J.D. degree from Harvard Law School, where he finished in the top five percent in his class. Following law school, Smith took a job at the New York City law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz. His second day on the job, he was asked to take a case defending tobacco companies. He declined, and returned to Oregon. He briefly worked for Stoel Rives, but became motivated to establish an organization dedicated to engaging young people with progressive politics. He soon left the law firm, founding the Bus Project in 2001. ==Political career== In 2008, Smith was elected with no opposition to the Oregon House of Representatives representing House District 47. The seat had been vacated by Jeff Merkley, who was running for the United States Senate. In the Legislature, Smith collaborated with representatives from rural Eastern Oregon to develop a statewide water strategy. He co-led the initiative called \\"Cool Schools\\" to create jobs by helping Oregon public schools begin retrofitting for energy savings. Smith co- led the legislature's budget transparency initiative to put Oregon government spending information online, and carried a bill to reduce the ratio of middle managers to line employees in state government. Smith also co-led the initiative to create online voter registration in Oregon, and carried a bill in the Legislature to allow trafficked minors to expunge their prostitution convictions upon reaching age 21 if they have had no other trouble with the law. In April 2011, Smith released the results of a video he compiled of Oregon state representatives reciting the lyrics of Rick Astley's 1980s pop hit \\"Never Gonna Give You Up\\". In September 2011, he announced he would run for Mayor of Portland in 2012. In the May 2012 primary election, Smith defeated most other candidates to become one of the two candidates advancing to the November general election. He received 32.9% of the vote in the primary, while Charlie Hales received 37.2%. In the general election, closing on November 6, 2012, Smith received approximately 31.3% of the vote and was defeated by Hales, who received 61.2%. Smith served in the 2012 Legislative session, but to facilitate his run for mayor he did not run for reelection to the House and vacated his seat in the Legislature after serving four years. ==Personal== Smith is married to Katy Lesowski, also a Portland native, and a co-founder of the Bus Project. His stepmother, Meredith Wood Smith, is former chair of the Oregon Democratic Party. ==2012 Portland Mayoral Campaign controversies== A series of incidents from Smith's past uncovered by The Oregonian and Willamette Week derailed his 2012 mayoral campaign. In July 2012, The Willamette Week revealed that Smith had been banned from an intramural soccer league in early 2011 after pushing another player, and subsequently ejected from a pickup basketball game at the Harriet Tubman School gym in North Portland after punching another player. Smith conceded to reporter Nigel Jaquiss that he had thrown a punch, but argued that the blow was not aimed at the player's genitals, as alleged by witness accounts. In August 2012, The Oregonian‚Äîfollowing up on earlier reporting‚Äîrevealed that Smith's driver's license had been suspended seven times from 2002 to 2010. Smith had previously declined to provide complete information about his driving record to the press. In October 2012, The Willamette Week revealed that Smith was cited for a misdemeanor assault in 1993 involving a woman. Smith's account of the incident to the press following the revelation was challenged by the victim and contradicted by the police report. As further details from the case emerged, Smith lost the endorsement of the Portland Police Association and the Portland Firefighters Association. Although Smith had been the mayoral frontrunner early on in the campaign, he would go on to lose to Charlie Hales by more than 30 percentage points. Smith would later concede that the revelations‚Äîespecially the assault charge‚Äîhad cost him the election. ===1993 fraternity party incident=== In 1993, Eugene police cited Smith for a misdemeanor assault charge stemming from an incident with an 18-year-old woman at fraternity party. According to the police report, the woman touched Smith's chest, after which he grabbed her arms. He then drew back and struck her with a fist to the eye, causing a one-inch cut that required several stitches. \\"He really popped me,\\" the victim told police. Smith was attending the University of Oregon at the time. Police and the Lane County District Attorney's office dropped the charge after Smith reached a diversion agreement with the city of Eugene and the victim. Smith agreed to cover the woman's medical expenses, pay a $250 court fee, and complete 20 hours of community service, among other conditions. The incident came to light during Smith's 2012 campaign for Portland mayor. Smith tried to speak with the victim at her home before reporters contacted her, but she told him to leave. Smith's eventual account of the incident to the press was challenged by the victim and contradicted by the police report. A year after the election, Smith admitted that the woman had rebuffed his advances before the altercation. Although Smith denied knocking the woman off of a couch later in the evening, he conceded to grabbing her and then hitting her above the eye when she confronted him. In November 2017, Smith resigned from the Oregon Center for Public Policy, just two weeks after his controversial appointment as executive director, as concerns of the 1993 incident resurfaced. == Radio entrepreneur and personality == In 2013, Smith led an effort to bring progressive talk radio to Portland's low-power non-profit radio station XRAY.FM. He brokered agreements with radio personalities including Thom Hartmann and Carl Wolfson. He also launched his own program, Thank You Democracy. Smith occasionally fills in as guest host of the Thom Hartmann Program. ==See also== *Portland, Oregon mayoral election, 2012 *Joseph Fielding Smith, Smith's grandfather ==References * Project VoteSmart biography *Ballotpedia election profile Category:1973 births Category:Living people Category:Members of the Oregon House of Representatives Category:Lawyers from Portland, Oregon Category:University of Oregon alumni Category:Harvard Law School alumni Category:Oregon Democrats Category:Smith family (Latter Day Saints) Category:Grant High School (Portland, Oregon) alumni Category:21st-century American politicians ","title":"Jefferson Smith (politician)"},{"id":"20198234","text":"Sir Henry at Rawlinson End may refer to: *Sir Henry at Rawlinson End (recording), 1978 *Sir Henry at Rawlinson End (film), 1980 ==See also== *Rawlinson End, radio broadcasts ","title":"Sir Henry at Rawlinson End"},{"id":"20198238","text":"The first Persian invasion of Greece, during the Persian Wars, began in 492 BC, and ended with the decisive Athenian victory at the Battle of Marathon in 490 BC. The invasion, consisting of two distinct campaigns, was ordered by the Persian king Darius the Great primarily in order to punish the city-states of Athens and Eretria. These cities had supported the cities of Ionia during their revolt against Persian rule, thus incurring the wrath of Darius. Darius also saw the opportunity to extend his empire into Europe, and to secure its western frontier. The first campaign in 492 BC, led by Mardonius, re- subjugated Thrace and forced Macedon to become a fully subordinate client kingdom part of Persia, after being a vassal to Persia as early as the late 6th century BC, probably in 512 BC. However, further progress was prevented when Mardonius's fleet was wrecked in a storm off the coast of Mount Athos. The following year, having demonstrated his intentions, Darius sent ambassadors to all parts of Greece, demanding their submission. He received it from almost all of them, except Athens and Sparta, both of whom executed the ambassadors. With Athens still defiant, and Sparta now effectively at war with him, Darius ordered a further military campaign for the following year. The second Persian campaign, in 490 BC, was under the command of Datis and Artaphernes. The expedition headed first to the island Naxos, which it captured and burned. It then island-hopped between the rest of the Cycladic Islands, annexing each into the Persian empire. Reaching Greece, the expedition landed at Eretria, which it besieged, and after a brief time, captured. Eretria was razed and its citizens enslaved. Finally, the task force headed to Attica, landing at Marathon, en route for Athens. There, it was met by a smaller Athenian army, which nevertheless proceeded to win a remarkable victory at the Battle of Marathon. This defeat prevented the successful conclusion of the campaign, and the task force returned to Asia. Nevertheless, the expedition had fulfilled most of its aims, punishing Naxos and Eretria, and bringing much of the Aegean under Persian rule, as well as the full inclusion of Macedon. The unfinished business from this campaign led Darius to prepare for a much larger invasion of Greece, to firmly subjugate it, and to punish Athens and Sparta. However, internal strife within the empire delayed this expedition, and Darius then died of old age. It was thus left to his son Xerxes I to lead the second Persian invasion of Greece, beginning in 480 BC. == Sources == Seal of King Darius the Great hunting in a chariot, reading \\"I am Darius, the Great King\\", in Old Persian, Elamite and Babylonian. British Museum. The main source for the Greco-Persian Wars is the Greek historian Herodotus. Herodotus, who has been called the 'Father of History',Cicero, On the Laws I, 5 was born in 484 BC in Halicarnassus, Asia Minor (then under Persian overlordship). He wrote his 'Enquiries' (Greek‚ÄîHistoria; English‚Äî(The) Histories) around 440‚Äì430 BC, trying to trace the origins of the Greco-Persian Wars, which would still have been relatively recent history (the wars finally ending in 450 BC).Holland, pp. xvi‚Äìxvii. Herodotus's approach was entirely novel, and at least in Western society, he does seem to have invented 'history' as we know it. As the British author Tom Holland has it: \\"For the first time, a chronicler set himself to trace the origins of a conflict not to a past so remote so as to be utterly fabulous, nor to the whims and wishes of some god, nor to a people's claim to manifest destiny, but rather explanations he could verify personally.\\" Some subsequent ancient historians, despite following in his footsteps, criticised Herodotus, starting with Thucydides.Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War, e.g. I, 22Finley, p. 15. Nevertheless, Thucydides chose to begin his history where Herodotus left off (at the Siege of Sestos), and therefore evidently felt that Herodotus's history was accurate enough not to need re-writing or correcting. Plutarch criticised Herodotus in his essay \\"On The Malignity of Herodotus\\", describing Herodotus as \\"Philobarbaros\\" (barbarian-lover), for not being pro-Greek enough, which suggests that Herodotus might actually have done a reasonable job of being even-handed.Holland, p. xxiv. A negative view of Herodotus was passed on to Renaissance Europe, though he remained well read. However, since the 19th century his reputation has been dramatically rehabilitated by archaeological finds which have repeatedly confirmed his version of events.Holland, p. 377. The prevailing modern view is that Herodotus generally did a remarkable job in his Historia, but that some of his specific details (particularly troop numbers and dates) should be viewed with skepticism. Nevertheless, there are still some historians who believe Herodotus made up much of his story.Fehling, pp. 1‚Äì277. The Sicilian historian Diodorus Siculus, writing in the 1st century BC in his Bibliotheca Historica, also provides an account of the Greco-Persian wars, partially derived from the earlier Greek historian Ephorus. This account is fairly consistent with Herodotus's.Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca Historica The Greco-Persian wars are also described in less detail by a number of other ancient historians including Plutarch, Ctesias of Cnidus, and are alluded by other authors, such as the playwright Aeschylus. Archaeological evidence, such as the Serpent Column, also supports some of Herodotus's specific claims.Note to Herodotus IX, 81 == Background == Achaemenid king killing a Greek hoplite. Circa 500 BC‚Äì475 BC. Metropolitan Museum of Art. The first Persian invasion of Greece had its immediate roots in the Ionian Revolt, the earliest phase of the Greco-Persian Wars. However, it was also the result of the longer-term interaction between the Greeks and Persians. In 500 BC the Persian Empire was still relatively young and highly expansionist, but prone to revolts amongst its subject peoples.Holland, p47‚Äì55Holland, p58‚Äì62Holland, p203 Moreover, the Persian king Darius was a usurper, and had spent considerable time extinguishing revolts against his rule. Even before the Ionian Revolt, Darius had begun to expand the Empire into Europe, subjugating Thrace, expanding past the Danube river, conquering Paeonia, and forcing Macedon to become a client kingdom to Persia; though the latter retaining an amount of autonomy up to 492 BC. Attempts at further expansion into the politically fractious world of Ancient Greece may have been inevitable.Fine, p276 However, the Ionian Revolt had directly threatened the integrity of the Persian empire, and the states of mainland Greece remained a potential menace to its future stability.Holland, 171‚Äì178 Darius thus resolved to subjugate and pacify Greece and the Aegean, and to punish those involved in the Ionian Revolt.Herodotus V, 105 The Ionian revolt had begun with an unsuccessful expedition against Naxos, a joint venture between the Persian satrap Artaphernes and the Miletus tyrant Aristagoras.Holland, p154‚Äì157 In the aftermath, Artaphernes decided to remove Aristagoras from power, but before he could do so, Aristagoras abdicated, and declared Miletus a democracy. The other Ionian cities, ripe for rebellion, followed suit, ejecting their Persian-appointed tyrants, and declaring themselves democracies.Herodotus V, 97 Aristagoras then appealed to the states of Mainland Greece for support, but only Athens and Eretria offered to send troops.Holland, p157‚Äì161 Darius the Great and its inscription (ŒîŒëŒ°ŒïŒôŒüŒ£, top right) on the \\"Darius Vase\\" The involvement of Athens in the Ionian Revolt arose from a complex set of circumstances, beginning with the establishment of the Athenian Democracy in the late 6th century BC. In 510 BC, with the aid of Cleomenes I, King of Sparta, the Athenian people had expelled Hippias, the tyrant ruler of Athens.Herodotus V, 65 With Hippias's father Peisistratus, the family had ruled for 36 out of the previous 50 years and fully intended to continue Hippias's rule. Hippias fled to Sardis to the court of the Persian satrap, Artaphernes, and promised control of Athens to the Persians if they were to help restore him.Herodotus V, 96 In the meantime, Cleomenes helped install a pro-Spartan tyranny under Isagoras in Athens, in opposition to Cleisthenes, the leader of the traditionally powerful Alcmaeonidae family, who considered themselves the natural heirs to the rule of Athens.Holland, pp131‚Äì132 In a daring response, Cleisthenes proposed to the Athenian people that he would establish a 'democracy' in Athens, much to the horror of the rest of the aristocracy. Cleisthenes's reasons for suggesting such a radical course of action, which would remove much of his own family's power, are unclear; perhaps he perceived that days of aristocratic rule were coming to an end anyway; certainly he wished to prevent Athens becoming a puppet of Sparta by whatever means necessary. However, as a result of this proposal, Cleisthenes and his family were exiled from Athens, in addition to other dissenting elements, by Isagoras. Having been promised democracy however, the Athenian people seized the moment and revolted, expelling Cleomenes and Isagoras.Holland, pp133‚Äì136 Cleisthenes was thus restored to Athens (507 BC), and at breakneck speed began to establish democratic government. The establishment of democracy revolutionised Athens, which henceforth became one of the leading cities in Greece. The new-found freedom and self-governance of the Athenians meant that they were thereafter exceptionally hostile to the return of the tyranny of Hippias, or any form of outside subjugation; by Sparta, Persia or anyone else. Cleomenes, unsurprisingly, was not pleased with events, and marched on Athens with the Spartan army.Holland, p136‚Äì138 Cleomenes's attempts to restore Isagoras to Athens ended in a debacle, but fearing the worst, the Athenians had by this point already sent an embassy to Artaphernes in Sardis, to request aid from the Persian Empire.Holland, p142 Artaphernes requested that the Athenians give him an 'earth and water', a traditional token of submission, which the Athenian ambassadors acquiesced to. However, they were severely censured for this when they returned to Athens. At some point later Cleomenes instigated a plot to restore Hippias to the rule of Athens. This failed and Hippias again fled to Sardis and tried to persuade the Persians to subjugate Athens.Herodotus V, 96 The Athenians dispatched ambassadors to Artaphernes to dissuade him from taking action, but Artaphernes merely instructed the Athenians to take Hippias back as tyrant. Needless to say, the Athenians balked at this, and resolved instead to be openly at war with Persia. Having thus become the enemy of Persia, Athens was already in a position to support the Ionian cities when they began their revolt. The fact that the Ionian democracies were inspired by the example of Athens no doubt further persuaded the Athenians to support the Ionian Revolt; especially since the cities of Ionia were (supposedly) originally Athenian colonies. The Athenians led a campaign against the Achaemenid capital of Sardis in Asia Minor in 498 BC, during the Ionian revolt. The city of Eretria also sent assistance to the Ionians for reasons that are not completely clear. Possibly commercial reasons were a factor; Eretria was a mercantile city, whose trade was threatened by Persian dominance of the Aegean. Herodotus suggests that the Eretrians supported the revolt in order to repay the support the Milesians had given Eretria in a past war against Chalcis.Herodotus V, 98 The Athenians and Eretrians sent a task force of 25 triremes to Asia Minor.Herodotus V, 99 Whilst there, the Greek army surprised and outmaneuvered Artaphernes, marching to Sardis and there burning the lower city.Holland, p160 However, this was as much as the Greeks achieved, and they were then pursued back to the coast by Persian horsemen, losing many men in the process. Despite the fact their actions were ultimately fruitless, the Eretrians and in particular the Athenians had earned Darius's lasting enmity, and he vowed to punish both cities.Holland, p168 The Persian naval victory at the Battle of Lade (494 BC) all but ended the Ionian Revolt, and by 493 BC, the last hold-outs were vanquished by the Persian fleet.Holland, p176 The revolt was used as an opportunity by Darius to extend the empire's border to the islands of the East AegeanHerodotus VI, 31 and the Propontis, which had not been part of the Persian dominions before.Herodotus VI, 33 The completion of the pacification of Ionia allowed the Persians to begin planning their next moves; to extinguish the threat to the empire from Greece, and to punish Athens and Eretria.Holland, p177‚Äì178 == 492 BC: Mardonius' campaign == Immortals, a frieze in Darius's palace at Susa. Siliceous glazed bricks, c. 510 BC, Louvre In the spring of 492 BC an expeditionary force, to be commanded by Darius's son-in-law Mardonius, was assembled, consisting of a fleet and a land army.Herodotus VI, 43 Whilst the ultimate aim was to punish Athens and Eretria, the expedition also aimed to subdue as many of the Greek cities as possible.Herodotus VI, 44 Departing from Cilicia, Mardonius sent the army to march to the Hellespont, whilst he travelled with the fleet. He sailed round the coast of Asia Minor to Ionia, where he spent a short time abolishing the tyrannies that ruled the cities of Ionia. Ironically, since the establishment of democracies had been a key factor in the Ionian Revolt, he replaced the tyrannies with democracies. Thence the fleet continued on to the Hellespont, and when all was ready, shipped the land forces across to Europe. The army then marched through Thrace, re-subjugating it, since these lands had already been added to the Persian Empire in 512 BC, during Darius's campaign against the Scythians.Holland, p153 Upon reaching Macedon, the Persians forced it to become a fully subordinate part of the Persian Empire; they had been vassals of the Persians since the late 6th century BC, but retained their general autonomy. Meanwhile, the fleet crossed to Thasos, resulting in the Thasians submitting to the Persians. The fleet then rounded the coastline as far as Acanthus in Chalcidice, before attempting to round the headland of Mount Athos. However, they were caught in a violent storm, which drove them against the coastline of Athos, wrecking (according to Herodotus) 300 ships, with the loss of 20,000 men. Then, whilst the army was camped in Macedon, the Brygians, a local Thracian tribe, launched a night raid against the Persian camp, killing many of the Persians, and wounding Mardonius.Herodotus VI, 45 Despite his injury, Mardonius made sure that the Brygians were defeated and subjugated, before leading his army back to the Hellespont; the remnants of the navy also retreated to Asia. Although this campaign ended ingloriously, the land approaches to Greece had been secured, and the Greeks had no doubt been made aware of Darius's intentions for them. == 491 BC: Diplomacy == Perhaps reasoning that the expedition of the previous year may have made his plans for Greece obvious, and weakened the resolve of the Greek cities, Darius turned to diplomacy in 491 BC. He sent ambassadors to all the Greek city states, asking for \\"earth and water\\", a traditional token of submission.Herodotus VI 48 The vast majority of cities did as asked, fearing the wrath of Darius. In Athens, however, the ambassadors were put on trial and then executed; in Sparta, they were simply thrown down a well.Holland, pp178‚Äì179 This firmly and finally drew the battle-lines for the coming conflict; Sparta and Athens, despite their recent enmity, would together fight the Persians. However, Sparta was then thrown into disarray by internal machinations. The citizens of Aegina had submitted to the Persian ambassadors, and the Athenians, troubled by the possibility of Persia using Aegina as a naval base, asked Sparta to intervene.Holland, pp179‚Äì181 Cleomenes travelled to Aegina to confront the Aeginetans personally, but they appealed to Cleomenes's fellow king Demaratus, who supported their stance.Herodotus VI, 49 Cleomenes responded by having Demaratus declared illegitimate, with the help of the priests at Delphi (whom he bribed); Demaratus was replaced by his cousin Leotychides. Now faced with two Spartan kings, the Aeginetans capitulated, and handed over hostages to the Athenians as a guarantee of their good behaviour.Herodotus VI, 73 However, in Sparta news emerged of the bribes Cleomenes had given at Delphi, and he was expelled from the city.Herodotus VI, 74 He then sought to rally the northern Peloponnesus to his cause, at which the Spartans relented, and invited him back to the city. By 491 BC though, Cleomenes was widely considered insane and was sentenced to prison where he was found dead the following day. Cleomenes was succeeded by his half-brother Leonidas I. == 490 BC: Datis and Artaphernes' campaign == Taking advantage of the chaos in Sparta, which effectively left Athens isolated, Darius decided to launch an amphibious expedition to finally punish Athens and Eretria.Holland, pp181‚Äì183 An army was assembled in Susa, and marched into Cilicia, where a fleet had been gathered. Command of the expedition was given to Datis the Mede and Artaphernes, son of the satrap Artaphernes. === Size of the Persian force === The various soldiers of the army of Darius I are illustrated on the tomb of Darius I at Naqsh-e Rostam, with a mention of each ethnicity in individual labels.The Achaemenid Empire in South Asia and Recent Excavations in Akra in Northwest Pakistan Peter Magee, Cameron Petrie, Robert Knox, Farid Khan, Ken Thomas p.713-714List of ethnicities with corresponding drawing The ethnicities are, in order: Makan, Persian, Median, Elamite, Parthian, Arian, Bactrian, Sogdian, Choresmian, Zarangian, Arachosian, Sattagydian, Gandharan, Hindush (Indian), Saka (haumavarga), Saka (tigraxauda), Babylonian, Assyrian, Arab, Egyptian, Armenian, Cappadocian, Lydian, Ionian, Saka beyond the sea, Skudrian (Thracian), Macedonian, Libyan, Nubian, Carian.DNe inscription Identical depictions were made on the tombs of other Achaemenid emperors, the best preserved frieze being that of Xerxes I. According to Herodotus, the fleet sent by Darius consisted of 600 triremes.Herodotus VI, 95 There is no indication in the historical sources of how many transport ships accompanied them, if any. Herodotus claimed that 3,000 transport ships accompanied 1,207 triremes during Xerxes's invasion in 480 BC.Herodotus VII, 97 Among modern historians, some have accepted this number of ships as reasonable; it has been suggested either that the number 600 represents the combined number of triremes and transport ships,Green, p90 or that there were horse transports in addition to 600 triremes.Lazenby, p46 Herodotus does not estimate the size of the Persian army, only saying that they formed a \\"great and well-furnished army\\".Herodotus VI 95 Among other ancient sources, the poet Simonides, a near- contemporary, says the campaign force numbered 200,000, while a later writer, the Roman Cornelius Nepos estimates 200,000 infantry and 10,000 cavalry.Cornelius Nepos, Miltiades, 4 Plutarch and Pausanias both independently give 300,000, as does the Suda dictionary;Plutarch, Moralia, 305BPausanias IV, 22Suda dictionary, entry Hippias Plato and Lysias assert 500,000; and Justin 600,000.Plato, Menexenus, 240ALysias, Funeral Oration, 21Justinus II, 9 Modern historians generally dismiss these numbers as exaggerations. One approach to estimate the number of troops is to calculate the number of marines carried by 600 triremes. Herodotus tells us that each trireme in the second invasion of Greece carried 30 extra marines, in addition to a probable 14 standard marines.Herodotus VII, 184 Thus, 600 triremes could easily have carried 18,000‚Äì26,000 infantry.Kampouris (2000) Numbers proposed for the Persian infantry are in the range 18,000‚Äì100,000.Davis, pp9‚Äì13Holland, p390Lloyd, p164 However, the consensus is around 25,000. The Persian infantry used in the invasion was probably a heterogeneous group drawn from across the empire. However, according to Herodotus, there was at least a general conformity in the type of armour and style of fighting.Lazenby, pp23‚Äì29 The troops were, generally speaking, armed with a bow, 'short spear' and sword, carried a wicker shield, and wore at most a leather jerkin. The one exception to this may have been the ethnic Persian troops, who may have worn a corslet of scale armour. Some contingents would have been armed somewhat differently; for instance, the Saka were renowned axemen.Holland, pp17‚Äì18 The 'elite' contingents of the Persian infantry seem to have been the ethnic Persians, Medians, Cissians and the Saka; Herodotus specifically mentions the presence of Persians and Saka at Marathon.Herodotus VI, 113 The style of fighting used by the Persians was probably to stand off from an enemy, using their bows (or equivalent) to wear down the enemy before closing in to deliver the coup de grace with spear and sword. Estimates for the cavalry are usually in the 1,000‚Äì3,000 range.ŒôœÉœÑŒøœÅŒØŒ± œÑŒøœÖ ŒïŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒπŒ∫Œøœç ŒàŒ∏ŒΩŒøœÖœÇ (History of the Greek nation volume Œí), Athens 1971 The Persian cavalry was usually provided by the ethnic Persians, Bactrians, Medes, Cissians, and Saka; most of these probably fought as lightly armed missile cavalry.Lazenby, p232 The fleet must have had at least some proportion of transport ships, since the cavalry was carried by ship; whilst Herodotus claims the cavalry was carried in the triremes, this is improbable. Lazenby estimates 30‚Äì40 transport ships would be required to carry 1,000 cavalry. === Lindos === Once assembled, the Persian force sailed from Cilicia firstly to the island of Rhodes. A Lindian Temple Chronicle records that Datis besieged the city of Lindos, but was unsuccessful.Lind. Chron. D 1‚Äì59 in Higbie (2003) === Naxos === The fleet then moved north along the Ionian coast towards Samos, before turning west into the Aegean Sea.Holland, pp183‚Äì186 The fleet sailed next to Naxos, in order to punish the Naxians for their resistance to the failed expedition that the Persians had mounted there a decade earlier. Many of the inhabitants fled to the mountains; according to Herodotus, those that the Persians caught were enslaved. The Persians then burnt the city and temples of the Naxians.Herodotus VI, 96 === The Cyclades === Satellite image of the Cyclades. Delos is the small island directly to the bottom-left of Mykonos Moving on, the Persian fleet approached Delos, whereupon the Delians also fled from their homes.Herodotus VI, 97 Having demonstrated Persian power at Naxos, Datis now intended to show clemency to the other islands, if they submitted to him. He sent a herald to the Delians, proclaiming: > \\"Holy men, why have you fled away, and so misjudged my intent? It is my own > desire, and the king's command to me, to do no harm to the land where the > two gods were born, neither to the land itself nor to its inhabitants. So > return now to your homes and dwell on your island.\\" Datis then burned 300 talents of frankincense on the altar of Apollo on Delos, to show his respect for one of the gods of the island. The fleet then proceeded to island-hop across the rest of Aegean on its way to Eretria, taking hostages and troops from each island. === Karystos === The Persians finally arrived off the southern tip of Euboea, at Karystos. The citizens of Karystos refused to give hostages to the Persians, so they were besieged, and their land ravaged, until they submitted to the Persians.Herodotus VI, 99 === Siege of Eretria === The task force then sailed around Euboea to the first major target, Eretria.Herodotus VI, 100 According to Herodotus, the Eretrians were divided amongst themselves as to the best course of action; whether to flee to the highlands, or undergo a siege, or to submit to the Persians. In the event, the majority decision was to remain in the city.Herodotus VI, 101 The Eretrians made no attempt to stop the Persians landing, or advancing, and thus allowed themselves to be besieged. For six days the Persians attacked the walls, with losses on both sides; however, on the seventh day two reputable Eretrians opened the gates and betrayed the city to the Persians. The city was razed, and temples and shrines were looted and burned. Furthermore, according to Darius's commands, the Persians enslaved all the remaining townspeople. === Battle of Marathon === Battle of Marathon. The Persian fleet next headed south down the coast of Attica, landing at the bay of Marathon, roughly from Athens, on the advice of Hippias, son of the former tyrant of Athens, Peisistratus.Herodotus VI, 102 The Athenians, joined by a small force from Plataea, marched to Marathon, and succeeded in blocking the two exits from the plain of Marathon.Holland, pp187‚Äì190 At the same time, Athens' greatest runner, Pheidippides (or Philippides) was sent to Sparta to request that the Spartan army march to Athens' aid. Pheidippides arrived during the festival of Carneia, a sacrosanct period of peace, and was informed that the Spartan army could not march to war until the full moon rose; Athens could not expect reinforcement for at least ten days.Herodotus VI, 105 They decided to hold out at Marathon for the time being, and they were reinforced by a contingent of hoplites from Plataea. The Greek wings envelop the Persians Stalemate ensued for five days, before the Athenians (for reasons that are not completely clear) decided to attack the Persians.Lazenby, pp59‚Äì62 Despite the numerical advantage of the Persians, the hoplites proved devastatingly effective, routing the Persians wings before turning in on the centre of the Persian line; the remnants of the Persian army left the battle and fled to their ships.Holland, pp195‚Äì197 Herodotus records that 6,400 Persian bodies were counted on the battlefield;Herodotus VI, 117 the Athenians lost just 192 men and the Plataeans 11. In the immediate aftermath of the battle, Herodotus says that the Persian fleet sailed around Cape Sunium to attack Athens directly,Herodotus VI, 115 although some modern historians place this attempt just before the battle.Holland, pp191‚Äì194 Either way, the Athenians evidently realised that their city was still under threat, and marched as quickly as possible back to Athens.Herodotus VI, 116 The Athenians arrived in time to prevent the Persians from securing a landing, and seeing that the opportunity was lost, the Persians turned about and returned to Asia. On the next day, the Spartan army arrived, having covered the in only three days. The Spartans toured the battlefield at Marathon, and agreed that the Athenians had won a great victory.Herodotus VI, 120 == Aftermath == Greek hoplite and Persian warrior depicted fighting. 5th century BC The defeat at Marathon ended for the time being the Persian invasion of Greece. However, Thrace and the Cycladic islands had been resubjugated into the Persian empire, and Macedon reduced to a subordinate kingdom part of the empire; since the late 6th century BC they had been vassals of the Persians, but remained having a broad scope of autonomy. Darius was still fully intent on conquering Greece, to secure the western part of his empire.Holland, p177 Moreover, Athens remained unpunished for its role in the Ionian Revolt, and both Athens and Sparta were unpunished for their treatment of the Persian ambassadors. Darius therefore began raising a huge new army with which he meant to completely subjugate Greece; however, in 486 BC, his Egyptian subjects revolted, indefinitely postponing any Greek expedition.Holland, p202‚Äì203 Darius then died whilst preparing to march on Egypt, and the throne of Persia passed to his son Xerxes I.Holland, pp206‚Äì208 Xerxes crushed the Egyptian revolt, and very quickly restarted the preparations for the invasion of Greece.Holland, pp208‚Äì211 This expedition was finally ready by 480 BC, and the second Persian invasion of Greece thereby began, under the command of Xerxes himself.Holland, pp240‚Äì244 == Significance == For the Persians, the two expeditions to Greece had been largely successful; new territories had been added to their empire and Eretria had been punished. It was only a minor setback that the invasion had met defeat at Marathon; that defeat barely dented the enormous resources of the Persian empire.Holland, p200 Yet, for the Greeks, it was an enormously significant victory. It was the first time that Greeks had beaten the Persians, and showed them that the Persians were not invincible, and that resistance, rather than subjugation, was possible.Holland, p201 The victory at Marathon was a defining moment for the young Athenian democracy, showing what might be achieved through unity and self-belief; indeed, the battle effectively marks the start of a 'golden age' for Athens.Holland, p138 This was also applicable to Greece as a whole; \\"their victory endowed the Greeks with a faith in their destiny that was to endure for three centuries, during which western culture was born\\".Fuller, pp11‚Äì32 John Stuart Mill's famous opinion was that \\"the Battle of Marathon, even as an event in British history, is more important than the Battle of Hastings\\".Powell et al., 2001 Militarily, a major lesson for the Greeks was the potential of the hoplite phalanx. This style had developed during internecine warfare amongst the Greeks; since each city-state fought in the same way, the advantages and disadvantages of the hoplite phalanx had not been obvious. Marathon was the first time a phalanx faced more lightly armed troops, and revealed how devastating the hoplites could be in battle.Holland, p194‚Äì197 The phalanx formation was still vulnerable to cavalry (the cause of much caution by the Greek forces at the Battle of Plataea), but used in the right circumstances, it was now shown to be a potentially devastating weapon.Holland, pp344‚Äì352 The Persians seem to have more-or-less disregarded the military lessons of Marathon. The composition of infantry for the second invasion seems to have been the same as during the first, despite the availability of hoplites and other heavy infantry in Persian-ruled lands.Lazenby, p28 Having won battles against hoplites previously, the Persians may simply have regarded Marathon as an aberration. == See also  References  Bibliography  Ancient sources === * Herodotus, The Histories * Thucydides, History of The Peloponnesian Wars * Diodorus Siculus, Library * Lysias, Funeral Oration * Plato, Menexenus * Xenophon Anabasis * Cornelius Nepos Lives of the Eminent Commanders (Miltiades) * Plutarch Parallel Lives (Aristides, Themistocles), On the Malice of Herodotus * Pausanias, Description of Greece * Marcus Junianus Justinus Epitome of the Philippic History of Pompeius Trogus * Photius, Bibliotheca or Myriobiblon: Epitome of Persica by Ctesias * Suda lexicon === Modern sources === * * * Lazenby, JF.

Valuation Act, 62nd Congress, ch. 92, , enacted 1913-03-01. This information would be used to set rates for the transport of freight. ==Background== The act was the brainchild of ICC commissioners Charles A. Prouty and Franklin K. Lane. Its objective was the setting of fair rates for freight shipments. It was a classic piece of Progressive Era legislation designed to find a scientific basis for setting tariffs (shipping charges) by determining the correct value of each railroad's real property and assets. Members of Congress assumed that with this information, the ICC would be able to set rates according to the principle of a reasonable rate of return on the real value of each railroad and the industry as a whole. ==Implementation== The law amended the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887 and required the ICC to organize a Bureau of Valuation in order to undertake the assessments. The ICC formulated a set of procedural and reporting standards for the valuation process, and then permitted the individual railroads to complete the valuation under the nominal supervision of an ICC administration. Although the original intent of the Valuation Act was to prepare a one-time assessment of railroad assets, subsequent legislation had the effect of prolonging the process. The Esch-Cummins Act of 1920 expanded the ICC's rate- setting responsibilities, and the agency in turn required updated valuation data from the railroads.Esch‚ÄìCummins Act, Pub.L. 66-152, . Approved 1920-02-28. The enlarged process led to a major increase in ICC staff, and the valuations continued for almost 20 years. The valuation process turned out to be of limited use in helping the ICC set rates fairly. Congress passed a minor amendment to the law in 1922.. 67th Congress, ch. 210, , enacted 1922-06-07. ==Aftermath== Prouty resigned from his Commissioner post at the ICC to serve as the first Valuation Bureau Chairman. Lane resigned to become Secretary of the Interior in the Woodrow Wilson administration. ==See also== * Hepburn Act (1906; authorized ICC to set rates) * History of rail transport in the United States ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Committee on Railroad Securities. * ==External links== * Selected ICC Valuation Reports (1929-1964) Category:1913 in American law Category:1913 in rail transport Category:62nd United States Congress Category:History of rail transportation in the United States Category:Interstate Commerce Commission Category:Progressive Era in the United States Category:United States federal transportation legislation Category:United States railroad regulation ","title":"Valuation Act"},{"id":"20198293","text":"The Barbados Association for Children With Intellectual Challenges, formerly the Barbados Association for Mentally Retarded Children, is a charitable organization in Barbados for children and adults with intellectual disability.

It took place on the weekend of Friday 10 July, Saturday, 11 July and Sunday, 12 July at Punchestown Racecourse near Naas in County Kildare, Ireland. Kings of Leon, Snow Patrol, Blur and The Killers headlined. The festival took place over three days, with reports of a four-day festival proving unconfirmed as did rumours, described as \\"ridiculous\\", that a 6 pm curfew would be imposed on the Sunday. The festival slot was the only Irish performance by Kings of Leon in 2009. It also featured the only Irish live performance of Blur in 2009. The Killers were voted most popular band in an official poll conducted on the Oxegen website after the event. The band later used footage from the festival on their live DVD Live from the Royal Albert Hall, released on 6 November that year. Oxegen 2009 was officially opened by the Artane Band on 10 July at 14:00. The festival was heralded as \\"a marvel of organisation\\" when compared to the Woodstock Festival held in the United States in 1969. Oxegen 2009 was also the first European music festival to have an X-ray machine onsite. It was also praised for its greenness and recognised as the largest 100% CarbonNeutral event in Ireland. == Build-up  Tickets === Tickets for the festival were on offer as prizes to those who filled in an online survey won by Kings of Leon, the first headliner announced for the second consecutive year on 28 January 2009. A similar survey led to them being booked for the 2008 festival. Early Bird tickets went on sale to registered online users on Friday 8 August, and to all-comers on Friday 15 August at the 2008 price of ‚Ç¨224.50 (including booking fee). These were limited to four per person, with a free car park space with every four tickets. Tickets went on general release on 6 March 2009 at 08:00. Once again, it was possible to buy an additional Thursday Camping Pass for ‚Ç¨20. As of 23 April, Oxegen 2009 had not yet sold out. It had not sold out by 20 June either. It eventually sold out on 12 July after a sudden rush for day tickets. As with the 2008 festival, the campsite opened on the Thursday evening to prevent traffic queues forming on the Friday. The popularity of a ticket deposit scheme introduced in March 2009 was confirmed when it returned in May. === Early reports === On Thursday 17 July 2008, just days after the 2008 festival had ended, Phantom FM published a report suggesting that organisers of T in the Park, Oxegen's sister festival which traditionally shares many of the same bands as Oxegen, were reportedly seeking David Bowie to headline the 2009 festival which took place on the same weekend. The 62-year-old was previously due to headline both T and Oxegen in 2004, but had to pull out due to illness. Klaxons put themselves in contention to play at Oxegen 2009 after announcing that they will \\"play every festival possible\\" in 2009. But they didn't. === Official announcements === Official site map Kings of Leon were again the first band to be confirmed for Oxegen in 2009, with their announcement coming on 28 January 2009. They headlined for the second consecutive year, having won the approval of fans in an online vote for a second consecutive year as well. Hot Press then announced what they claimed was a \\"world exclusive\\" late on 28 January 2009 that Snow Patrol and The Killers, headliners in 2007, would be co-headliners in 2009. An appearance by Snow Patrol was confirmed by the organisers within two days, with Katy Perry, Bloc Party and The Script also being confirmed on 30 January 2009. Kings of Leon played Oxegen's sister festival T in the Park on its Friday whilst Snow Patrol played T on its Sunday night. Also from T in the Park persistent rumours have forced the organisers to deny that AC/DC are the other headliners. On 5 February, the reformed Blur were announced as the remaining headliners in what was their only Irish appearance of the year and their first in Ireland since three shows in the Olympia Theatre, Dublin in 2003. It will also be only the third time that all the original members will be together since 2000, with the second occurring a week earlier in Hyde Park, London at a 55,000 sell-out show which followed an appearance at Glastonbury 2009. The Killers were named as headliners on 18 February. On 12 February, The Irish Times announced that Pete Doherty would be playing the festival. Doherty was confirmed within twenty-four hours alongside nine other acts: Razorlight, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, Elbow, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, The Ting Tings, White Lies, Fight Like Apes, Pendulum and Jason Mraz. On 24 February, Keane, Lily Allen, The Specials, Paolo Nutini, Wallis Bird, Digitalism, The Mars Volta, Swedish House Mafia, Miss Kittin/The Hacker, Crookers and Hockey were confirmed by MCD. The Specials were announced after they reformed to celebrate thirty years in the music business, although it was unclear at the time if founding member Jerry Dammers would be included. The Truffle Shuffles learned of their invitation to perform whilst live on Rick O'Shea's RT√â 2fm radio show on 25 February. On 3 March, eleven new acts were added to the line-up for Oxegen 2009. These were Lady Gaga, Manic Street Preachers, Florence and the Machine, TV on the Radio, The Game, Ladyhawke, James, Foals, Of Montreal, Friendly Fires and Squeeze. James will play a warm-up show in The Academy on 8 July. On 5 March, Oxegen 2009 was officially launched by the organisers, with an initial stage breakdown unveiled and a number of new acts announced. These included Nine Inch Nails, Jane's Addiction, Pet Shop Boys, Glasvegas, The Saturdays, Doves, Eagles of Death Metal and God Is an Astronaut. Techno/electronica musicians Niall \\"Mano le Tough\\" Mannion and Ruairi Donohue of the Red Bull Music Academy also performed at Oxegen in 2009. On 8 April, 202s announced they would be performing on the Friday of the festival. Calvin Harris, Noisettes, The Saw Doctors, The Coronas, The Blizzards, The Answer, The Horrors, Iglu & Hartly, Starsailor and Spinnerette were added to the line- up on 28 April. La Roux cancelled citing \\"touring commitments\\". One DJ or VJ was offered a half-hour slot at the festival in association with Xbox. More dance acts, including Felix da Housecat and The Japanese Popstars, were announced on 7 May 2009. On 14 May 2009, Therapy?, Tinchy Stryder, Boys Noize and Fever Ray (Karin Dreijer Andersson of The Knife) were all announced. MCD announced the stage breakdown on 18 May 2009. The return of the Hot Press Signing Tent was confirmed on 21 May 2009. The line-up for the Red Bull Music Academy was confirmed on 22 May 2009. The Hot Press New Band Stage line-up was announced on 27 May 2009. On 3 June 2009, the IMRO New Sounds Stage line-up was announced, with David Kitt, Director and Villagers confirmed as headliners. Also performing on that stage are C O D E S, Heathers, Blood or Whiskey, Juno Award winners Wintersleep, Broken Record from Scotland, Home Star Runner and Concerto For Constantine. On 12 June 2009, the entertainment line-up and further details of facilities for campers was announced. The campsite remained open until 18:00 on the Monday after the festival. The Thursday night entertainment featured bands such as Snakes of Desire, The Stone Roses Experience, Definitely Might Be and Hells Bells. The Xbox Live Stage was located to the Blue Campsite and ran each day of the festival from 14:00 until late into the night and the Headphone Disco is available to a maximum 2,500 campers per night. A funfair was present in each campsite (the previous year had one shared between all the campsites) and other features included barbecue areas for those with disposable barbecues, the Pull Parlour Salon and better facilities for phone charging. Scouting Ireland returned to offer their free tent pitching service. Several acts were added to the Bacardi Arena on 25 June 2009. The return of Heineken Greenspace was announced on 29 June 2009. The stage times were released on 1 July 2009. === Related events === The Blizzards performed a live online show on their website in association with Xbox on 27 May 2009. The webcast preceded appearances by the band and the return of the Xbox Live Stage to Oxegen 2009. Xbox also ran a competition with a top prize of a half-hour DJ set on the Xbox Live Stage at Oxegen 2009. The Irish Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources Eamon Ryan endorsed a \\"Rock the Environment\\" competition designed to promote Oxegen 2009 as being a \\"green festival\\". Ryan said the festival was \\"sustainable, green and fun\\". Competitors were asked to send in their environmentally-friendly videos to the Oxegen Muzu TV channel. Winners will have their entries broadcast in the green Ecogen area. Two acts from County Kildare featured at Oxegen in 2009; these were decided via the annual Platform V contest. Box Social, Colin Scallan, I Phoenix, The J-Walkers, The Resistance and Seven Days were the six finalists; two were selected in Naas, County Kildare on 19 June. The Road Safety Authority (RSA), Kildare County Council and MCD used youth radio stations to front a road safety campaign throughout Oxegen 2009. Billboards of four young persons from County Kildare who died in 2005 and 2007 were on display onsite. Mobile messages and the big stage screens were also used to promote road safety. The Irish Society of Chartered Physiotherapists and the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy Northern Ireland jointly produced a festival guide aimed at fans, issuing advice on walking, camping and how to dance appropriately and pain-free. === Publications === Several newspapers and magazines issued special editions for Oxegen 2009. Hot Press featured the Ultimate Guide to Oxegen '09 prior to the festival. It included the favourite Oxegen moments of six Irish musicians and interviews with Brody Dalle of Spinnerette and Dave Keuning of headliners The Killers. They also made several music videos of artists performing on the New Bands Stage available on their website. One week before the festival, Gary Lightbody of Oxegen headliners Snow Patrol was chosen as guest editor of The Ticket, The Irish Times weekly music supplement. Lightbody selected two musicians whose performances were covered in that week's edition--he chose Lisa Hannigan and Josh Ritter--and also chose which bands Jim Carroll would write about in his column about new music. Lightbody also wrote a guide to surviving festivals, interviewed Glenn Moule of the band Howling Bells and wrote a piece on which artists he intended to see perform at Oxegen, including Lily Allen, Republic of Loose, Patrick Wolf, TV on the Radio, Annie Mac, Elbow, Friendly Fires and Crystal Castles. The Irish Independent featured numerous Oxegen-related articles on 3 July 2009. These included reports on Blur, Fight Like Apes, Snow Patrol, The Ting Tings, Jerry Fish, a piece on Northern Irish acts such as David Holmes, That Petrol Emotion, Therapy?, Duke Special and The Answer, a piece on newer acts, twenty selected facts and an A‚ÄìZ of festival fashion. Gary Lightbody talked of his first time when Snow Patrol were in their early twenties and spent the night drinking and \\"being silly\\". === Traffic === Traffic delays were encountered by fans on their way to the festival on 9 July. MCD suggested fans ought to expect an addictional three hours of travel time. Buses in Limerick and Waterford were full since that morning, whilst those in Cork and Galway were said to be \\"meeting demand\\". Northern Ireland also experienced what was described by media as \\"a mass exodus\\" of fans to Oxegen 2009. Dublin Bus, which operates public transport from Parnell Square to Punchestown, said its journeys were running at one hour and ten minutes, a \\"good\\" time according to the company. 30,000 campers were on site by the Thursday night. The campsite opened at noon, with 35,000 campers having arrived by the Thursday night. These were entertained by AC/DC, Oasis and The Stone Roses cover bands on the Thursday Night Live Stage. Traffic after the festival was reported to be \\"moving well on all routes\\". == Festival  Weather === Festival-goers and musicians alike experienced rain and mud at Oxegen 2009. Hours of heavy torrential rain fell throughout the Saturday but, whilst wellies and raincoats were seen throughout the Saturday, the Sunday weather was sunnier. Jason Mraz described the weather as \\"perfect\\", saying that \\"going in and out of rain and sun [...] is a great way to celebrate.\\" He then claimed: \\"I've never experiences torrential rain in my life.\\" MC Double D of Sneaky Sound System described the differing tolerance for rain in Ireland and his native country. \\"You like it wet over here. I'm from Australia and we don't like it wet over there. You guys get a bit annoyed if it's too sunny I think. [...] We're playing in a tent so I can't complain.\\" === Performances === The Artane Boys Band, described as \\"one of the most famous warm-up acts in the country\\", opened Oxegen 2009 in an appearance described as \\"unlikely\\" by the Irish Independent. The first band to appear on the Hot Press New Band Stage on the Friday were The Truffle Shuffles, winners of RT√â 2fm's School of Rock competition. The band later met Main Stage performers The Script, giving Danny O'Donoghue a CD of their music. The Script themselves announced a five-night residency in Dublin's Olympia Theatre, beginning on 25 August 2009. Onstage they described the place as \\"crazy\\" and spoke of how they had been in the audience two years previously. James warmed up for their Friday performance with a show at The Academy in Dublin the night before. Lily Allen mingled with fans and had a song dedicated to her by Snow Patrol following her Main Stage performance (above). Lily Allen altered lyrics to one of her songs due to having a young Irish cousin in the audience. She had flown in from Belgrade and her performance included a cover version of \\"Womanizer\\" by Britney Spears and \\"Fuck You\\", her ode to George W. Bush, which had the crowd raising their middle fingers during the chorus. She also performed her cover version of the Kaiser Chiefs song \\"Oh My God\\" but bemoaned the crowd's reaction to some of her songs, yelling: \\"Oh, you guys are like women. C'mon you lot!\\" She later wandered around talking to fans alongside two bodyguards. Snow Patrol flew from Italy to perform at Oxegen 2009, interrupting their time spent touring with U2. They dedicated \\"Shut Your Eyes\\" to Lily Allen in their Main Stage performance before Blur. Blur were said to have been paid ‚Ç¨500,000 to perform at Oxegen 2009, headlining on the Friday night from 23:00. They played songs from three decades and paid tribute to an Irish music journalist who had assisted in their rise to fame, dedicating \\"There's No Other Way\\" to him, with lead singer Damon Albarn saying: \\"The first time we were here [in Ireland] was back in 1990. We played at a wedding for Leo Finlay, who has since passed away.\\" Albarn also said it had been \\"a fantastic couple of weeks after not doing much for 10 years.\\". They also dedicated \\"The Universal\\" to Joe Dolan who had covered the song before his death. Fred were the first band on the Green Spheres stage on the Saturday, playing to a large crowd and ending with singles \\"Running\\" and \\"Skyscrapers\\". Squeeze attracted increasing crowds throughout their time on the Main Stage, performing just before The Blizzards played to an even more significant sized crowd. Guy Garvey of Elbow thanked fans watching them despite the bad weather on the Saturday evening. Doves drew a large crowd to the O2 Stage despite performing at the same time as Bloc Party on the Main Stage. Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, however, attracted a small enough crowd to the same stage, with several fans leaving to see headliners Kings of Leon on the Main Stage. Kings of Leon headlined Oxegen from 23:30 on the Saturday despite threatening to withdraw from the festival after encountering serious sound problems at their T in the Park show in Scotland the day before. The sound problems frustrated vocalist Caleb Followill and led him to destroy his guitar before hurling the shattered remnants into the crowd. The band's tour manager intervened, with the band ultimately deciding to travel to Ireland. A source explained that the band's anger was due to their desire for \\"every show to be perfect\\". Several international celebrities watched Kings of Leon perform at Oxegen 2009; Pete Doherty and Stereophonics frontman Kelly Jones watched from the side of the stage, whilst actress Natalie Portman \\"disappeared down into the mosh pit\\" where she was seen \\"every now and then jumping up and down and belting out her favourite songs\\". The band said Oxegen was \\"the gig we've been looking forward to most this year\\". Lady Gaga underwent a wardrobe malfunction live on stage during her Sunday performance when one of her breasts slid from beneath her metallic dress. After a breakdown during her second song, Gaga expressed her frustrations at her production team: \\"I can't hear myself for a moment there. That was close there for a minute. It's my worst nightmare not being able to hear. I'd rather cut my fucking feet off rather than not be able to hear\\" and praised Irish fans for their battles against the weather: \\"You all suffer for your love of music, like Jesus\\" as well as saying: \\"If you told me this time last year I‚Äôd be playing in front of 100,000 people, I‚Äôd probably have told you to fuck off\\". She also had several costume changes, at one point appearing on a blue Vespa scooter and, during her single \\"Poker Face\\", writhing around on board a piano. Prior to the performance she had attracted attention for requesting underwear from festival organisers and was overheard asking about how to pronounce Naas. The Horrors cancelled their appearance at Oxegen 2009 when frontman Faris Badwin was struck down with bronchitis. Foals saw an increased crowd to their Heineken Green Spheres performance when rain drew festival-goers inside. The Ting Tings also drew large numbers to the O2 Stage. Perry Farrell of Jane's Addiction referenced Guinness, Jameson and cocaine during his band's performance. Villagers \\"set alight a sparsely populated tent with a performance bordering on perfection\\", according to the Irish Independent. Sunday night headliners The Killers attracted large crowds to the main arena but attendance at Manic Street Preachers and Nine Inch Nails suffered from those bands performing at the same time on other stages. === Signing tent === The first part of the line-up for the Hot Press signing tent was announced on 7 July 2009, with acts including Paolo Nutini, Razorlight, The Virgins, Fun Lovin' Criminals, The Blizzards, Hockey, Duke Special, Republic of Loose, The Coronas, Spinnerette, Friendly Fires and Therapy?. Other acts were later announced, including Noisettes (Sunday), Jerry Fish (Saturday), Doves (Saturday), Max√Ømo Park (Saturday), Squeeze (Saturday) The Airborne Toxic Event (Saturday), and That Petrol Emotion (Sunday). A timetable was released on the Hot Press website on 10 July. Republic of Loose, represented by all the band's members, were the first act to appear in the signing tent at around 18:00 on the Friday evening. Fans of The Coronas sang their \\"San Diego Song\\" whilst queueing, with the band also revealing the title of the second album for the first time, saying they had only decided on the title that day. Duke Special was greeted by several males in superhero costumes, whilst one fan who received an autograph from Brody Dalle of Spinnerette claimed she would have it tattooed onto her. Hockey were the first band to appear in the signing tent on the Saturday. Noisettes on the Green Spheres Stage at Oxegen '09. Friendly Fires were the first band to appear in the signing tent on the Sunday. One fan signed the bicep of lead singer Ed Macfarlane. Noisettes supplied lollipops and were dabbed with face paints by fans. Paolo Nutini signed autographs for twenty-five minutes longer than originally intended and shared wine gums with fans. === Backstage === A black and pink \\"chill-out area\\" decorated with black leather sofas was filled with fruits and flowers for the headlining bands. Performers were able to access areas with pool tables, bean bags and a bar. One member of The Saturdays was nearly struck with a cue ball by an unidentified person playing pool. \\"She looked at him like he had two heads. There's better things to do than throw a cue ball at a girl. Maybe I'm not good at this but I don't claim to chat up girls by throwing cue balls at them... I throw the black at them!\\" said Niall Breslin of The Blizzards who witnessed the incident. Danny O'Reilly of The Coronas described his band's performance as \\"so amazing\\" with \\"a really great atmosphere [...] the best gig we've done in a long time\\". Members of Republic of Loose reported that they were \\"stalked\\" repeatedly by Lily Allen. Max Grahn of Carolina Liar described meeting Irish fans for the first time, saying: \\"We got here for the first time in our lives yesterday. They know the songs and they know our names. It's crazy. We hope to be back in August.\\" Jason Mraz said Ireland had \\"always a very appreciative crowd, always a very vocal crowd, a singing bunch. I love them.\\" === VIP guests === Rugby union player Brian O'Driscoll and his actress friend Amy Huberman were in attendance, camping in a Winnebago. Upon trying to view Kings of Leon on a platform he was turned back by security as he did not have the correct wristband. Annoyed at this rejection, O'Driscoll left the festival early and flew to Dublin's RDS venue for a Bruce Springsteen concert, where he had a much more enjoyable time and cried when The Boss complimented him on stage on his sporting prowess. Pete Doherty, Kelly Jones and Natalie Portman, the latter of whom was seen buying pasta at one point, also attended the Kings of Leon show at Oxegen 2009. MTV presenter Laura Whitmore was seen backstage with Dan & Becs actress Holly White as well as actor Colin Morgan and actress Katie McGrath, of the BBC television series Merlin. Whitmore was also subject to speculation in the media when she was seen snuggling against TG4's Eoghan McDermott and walking around hand in hand with him. She moved to deny reports of romance, claiming they were \\"merely keeping each other company as they shot their respective footage of the festival\\" and said she had most enjoyed Blur. === Crime === Garda√≠ arrested 114 people throughout Oxegen 2009, mainly for offences relating to public order, traffic, assault and drugs. 100 of these arrests had been reported by the Sunday evening. 77 of the arrests occurred between the Thursday afternoon and the Saturday. 12 of the arrests had been made by the Friday. There were less arrests at Oxegen 2009 than at Oxegen 2008 when 140 arrests were made. In one serious incident, a man in his twenties was left in a stable condition after being stabbed with a glass bottle in a car park close to midnight on the Friday. He was sent to Naas General Hospital before being taken to Saint James's Hospital, Dublin. One man was arrested in relation to the incident but was not charged and later released. == Aftermath == The Specials entertained a wet and muddy crowd on the Main Stage, later announcing further Irish shows in Belfast and Dublin. === Cleanup === The site was described as resembling \\"a massive swamp\\" by the Evening Herald on the Sunday morning. Approximately 1,000 personnel and Scout volunteers were clearing the site of stage equipment, litter and abandoned tents by Monday afternoon. The Irish Independent reported that Punchestown Racecourse resembled \\"a scene from the World War I battle trenches\\" after being battered by heavy rain, whilst the Irish Examiner suggested that the Ploughing Championships had arrived in Dublin the day after the festival so noticeable were the \\"wellie-wearing punters [who] stepped off buses, full of cheer, bearing muddy rain jackets and laden with picnic and camping equipment\\". Buses deposited fans on Dublin's quays \\"where muddy wellies and bits of tents lay abandoned on the paths\\". === Returning bands === Several international acts announced future Irish dates during and in the immediate aftermath of Oxegen 2009. Yeah Yeah Yeahs will play a show in Belfast on 26 August 2009. The Specials will play shows in Dublin's Olympia Theatre and in Belfast as part of their 30th Anniversary Tour on 15 and 16 November respectively. Carolina Liar also announced their headlining Irish debut at The Academy in Dublin for 18 August 2009. Noisettes moved their 10 October show from The Button Factory to Vicar Street due to increased demand. == Broadcasting rights == MTV was the Oxegen 2009 official broadcasting partner, with Laura Whitmore amongst the presenting team. The highlights will be shown in late July‚Äìearly August on MTV, MTV HITS, MTV TWO and VH1 channels across one weekend. RT√â 2fm and RT√â 2XM broadcast a total of 21 hours of live coverage throughout Oxegen 2009. Dan Hegarty presented a special Oxegen IMRO Tasters Show in the week before the festival. Festival broadcasts began from 06:00 on 10 July during that morning's The Colm & Jim- Jim Breakfast Show. Jenny Green and Jenny Huston broadcast live music from 19:00 that evening, whilst Hegarty, Cormac Battle and Mr. Spring conducted acoustic sessions and interviews.

Despite competing almost exclusively at sprint distances, she was named American Champion Three-Year- Old Filly at the Eclipse Awards for 2001. She was inducted into the National Museum of Racing & Hall of Fame on August 7, 2015. ==Background== Xtra Heat is a bay mare bred in Kentucky by Pope McLean. She was by far the most successful horse sired by the Louisiana Derby winner Dixieland Heat. During her racing career she he was owned by Kenneth Taylor, Harry Deitchman, and her trainer, John Salzman, Sr. ==Racing career== In 2001, Xtra Heat set a new track record for six furlongs at Pimlico Race Course. Although she ran second by a neck in the 2001 Breeders' Cup Sprint to winner Squirtle Squirt, her performances that year earned Xtra Heat the Eclipse Award as American Champion Three-Year-Old Filly. Xtra Heat was retired after campaigning in 2003, having won 26 of her 35 lifetime starts and with earnings in excess of $2.3 million. On November 3, 2002, following the Breeders' Cup, Xtra Heat was auctioned at the Fasig-Tipton November Select Sale. She failed to sell when bidding \\"stalled\\" at $1.7 million and was returned to her owners. But on November 5, 2002, it was announced that the ClassicStar partnership (consisting of S. David Plummer, Tony Ferguson, Thom Robinson, and John Parrot) purchased Xtra Heat privately. The price was not disclosed.Xtra Heat Sold Privately  The Blood-Horse http://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/12542/xtra-heat-sold-privately ==Stud record== Xtra Heat has produced six foals since 2004, including stakes winners Southwestern Heat and Elusive Heat. ===Southwestern Heat=== Southwestern Heat (foaled April 17, 2004 in Kentucky) is a chestnut stallion by Gone West. As a yearling, he was entered in the Keeneland September 2005 Yearling Sale as hip #132. However, his reserve price of $600,000 was not met, so he did not sell at auction. His race record was 17: 4-2-7. In 2007, he won the Sonny Hine Stakes, was second in the Hirsch Jacobs Stakes (G3) and Oh Say Stakes, and was third in the Rumson Stakes and Anderson Fowler Stakes. He retired with $155,340 in earnings and now stands at stud at Willowbend Stud in Australia. Southwestern Heat's performance in the Sonny Hine Stakes at Laurel Park was covered in the Washington Post. The reporter wrote that \\"Southwestern Heat is a whirlwind, but unlike [Xtra Heat], the 3-year-old chestnut colt doesn't often show the grit and stamina to carry his speed to the finish line.\\" ===X Rated Cat=== X Rated Cat (foaled May 5, 2005 in Kentucky) is a bay stallion by Storm Cat. He was entered in the Keeneland September 2006 Yearling Sale as hip #368, but he was removed from the sale before bidding began. He was then sold the following spring at the Keeneland April 2007 Two-Year-Olds in Training Sale as hip #113 for $125,000 to Grey Flight Bloodstock. His race record was 9: 3-2-2 and he retired with $103,510 in earnings. In 2008, he was third in the Gilded Time Stakes. He currently stands at stud in Texas and bred 11 mares in 2009. ===Elusive Heat=== Elusive Heat (foaled April 30, 2006) is a dark bay mare by Elusive Quality.

Getfilings.com. Retrieved on 2014-01-14. Initially, the Virus-Serum-Toxin Act was created due to significant losses from unregulated manufacture and distribution of anti-hog cholera serum. The Act's intended purpose is to ensure the safe and efficient supply of animal vaccines and other biological products. The United States Secretary of Agriculture is responsible for licensing and regulating the manufacture, importation, and exportation of affected agents. The act and its applicable guidelines are managed by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). ==History== 180 px The Virus-Serum-Toxin Act was enacted in 1913. During this time, a USDA official stated that the bill was crucial \\"to protect the farmer and stock raiser from improperly made and prepared serums, toxins, and viruses.\\" After seven decades, the Act was amended in 1985 to address the effects of advancement, industrialization, and modernization in the field of agriculture. The Food Security Act of 1985 lists the specific amendments: (1) authorize USDA regulate intrastate, as well as interstate, movement of biological products, (2) broaden the Secretary's authority to issue regulations, (3) enhance enforcement powers, and (4) recognize a congressional view that regulation is \\"necessary to prevent and eliminate burdens on commerce and to effectively regulate commerce.\\" In 2002, the VSTA was one out of seven agricultural laws affected by the Homeland Security Act of 2002. This did not cause provisions within the law to change but only shifted certain functions from one department to another. In this case, border and import inspection functions were moved from USDA to the Department of Homeland Security. After the terrorist attacks that took place in America on September 11, 2001, Congress wanted to merge all of the major border inspection activities under the control of one department to make things easier and more efficient. Currently, the DHS manages the physical inspection of imports, but the USDA still has authority over VSTA regulations and policies. The DHS and USDA are required to cooperate with each other for proper regulation and inspection practice. ==Provisions== 275 px It makes it unlawful for any person, firm or corporation to engage in the \\"preparation, sale, barter, exchange, or shipment\\" of \\"worthless, contaminated, dangerous or harmful\\" virus, serum, toxin, or analogous animal biologicals in interstate commerce. The Act provides for licensing of products and establishments, and requires permits for the importation of animal biologicals. Regulations require preparation of biologicals in accordance with an approved Outline of Production so as to meet prescribed test requirements for purity, safety, potency, and efficacy. Regulations also require approval of all labeling and claims to be made in advertising. Animal biologicals are subject to both the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the VST Act. The USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) enforces the VST Act. ===Licenses issued by Administrator=== It is required that every person who is trained to prepare biological products subject to the VSTA shall have an unexpired, unsuspended, and unrevoked U.S. Veterinary Biologics Establishment License and at least one unexpired, unsuspended, and unrevoked U.S. Veterinary Biological Product License issued by the Administrator to prepare a biological product. Applicants who apply for an establishment license must also apply for at least one product license. An establishment license will not be issued without a license allowing the production of a biological product in the establishment. ===Types of license applications and their regulations=== *U.S. Veterinary Biologics Establishment License: The operator of each establishment has to submit a written application to the Administrator for a license. Blank applications are available upon request from the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. When a person runs more than one establishment, a separate application is required for each establishment. The person of the establishment who is interested in applying for a license must have a statement explaining the relationship between the applicant and the company. If there is a change in ownership, operation, location of establishment, or the license becomes expired, a new application must be filled out. Before the license can be issued by the Administrator, an inspection of the establishment will take place. The conditions, equipment, facilities, and methods used to prepare the biological products will be examined. The inspection will verify that the establishment meets all of the requirements. A license will not be issued unless the Administrator feels the establishment will use the products efficiently for all its intended purposes. They also must operate in compliance with VSTA. In addition, the applicant or person who is responsible for producing the biological product has to be qualified by education and/or experience. The establishment must state in written form that they will not use false advertisements concerning the biological product. Consumers cannot be misled or deceived. *U.S. Veterinary Biological Product License: The operator of the establishment has to submit a written application to the Administrator to obtain a license for each biological product that will be prepared in the establishment. Along with the application, several documents must be attached. The first type of document includes least four copies of an Outline of Production. Second, at least three copies of test reports and research data necessary to establish purity, safety, potency, and efficacy of the product must be attached. Third, legends describing which facilities are going to prepare each fraction of product are required. The fourth document has to contain completed labels. Along with these labels, all of the advertising matter and information regarding all claims to be made on labels must be attached. Once received, the Office of Management and Budget will approve this application. Once approved, several things must appear on the license. The true name of the product and its code number must be listed. The date in which the license was issued must be shown. Restrictions will be involved with the use of the product, which might include limited distribution and supervised usage. Licensed individuals have the option to request specific restrictions on the product if it pertains to the protection and safety of domestic animals and/or public health. These requests must be written and sent to the Director, Center for Veterinary Biologics, Licensing and Policy Development. In the requests, the person must state why the restrictions are needed. Supporting documents for these requests may also be attached. == Controversy == The first case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or mad cow disease, in the U.S. was reported in December 2003 at a farm in the state of Washington. Since the cow was from Canada, USDA officials thought the American beef supply was safe. However, after Japan and fifty-two other countries banned U.S. beef, the USDA started a program to test half of the nation's 450,000 cows that could not walk. The program did not find any cases of mad cow disease until June 25, 2005. The cow was found to have originated from America, was first tested in November 2004, and was recommended to be retested. During this time, the Bush administration restored about one-third of U.S. beef exports through intense lobbying, but Japan, the biggest export market, continued to deny America's beef. After a while, Japan lifted part of its ban. They allowed meat only from the carcasses of young cows that have had their spinal cords, vertebrae, brains, and bone marrow removed. Eventually, Japan reenacted the ban after a shipment from the U.S. contained meat with the vertebrae still attached. This has caused speculation on whether the VSTA regulates testing for BSE in cows. Many people believe that Congress should pass legislation forcing the USDA to license BSE testing to ranchers and slaughterhouses, and it is possible to amend the VSTA to do so.IATP  Think Forward. Iatp.typepad.com. Retrieved on 2014-01-14. After the first case of mad cow disease that was discovered, two more cases emerged. In 2005, the second instance was found in a cow in Texas, and the third was found in 2006 in a cow from Alabama. In 2012, this issue still remains a controversy. On April 24, 2012, the Department of Agriculture discovered a dairy cow in central California with mad cow disease. The USDA's chief veterinary officer, John Clifford, stated that the cow's meat did not enter the food supply. In addition to this, the carcass will be destroyed. The infected cow was found due to random sampling and is considered the fourth cow in the U.S. to be infected with BSE. This has caused the controversy to arise once again and speculation on whether the VSTA regulates testing for BSE in cows is still a hot topic to be discussed. == References == *Text of the Act *CRS Report for Congress: Agriculture: A Glossary of Terms, Programs, and Laws, 2005 Edition - Order Code 97-905 == External links == * The Virus-Serum-Toxin Act - A Brief History and Analysis Category:1913 in American law Category:62nd United States Congress Category:United States federal agriculture legislation Category:Animal vaccines Category:Veterinary medicine in the United States ","title":"Virus-Serum-Toxin Act"},{"id":"20198362","text":"Andras Guttormsson, (c. 1490 to 1544), was, from 1531 to 1544, lawman (prime minister) of the Faroe Islands.

The film is based on the best-selling French novel Les Emmur√©s by Serge Brussolo. It is Paquet-Brenner's English-language film debut. ==Plot== Sam Walczak (Mischa Barton), is a recent engineering graduate. At her graduation party, her father, an owner of a demolition company, gives her a gift: a job supervising the demolition of a building in the middle of nowhere. If she's successful, she will become his partner. Sam arrives at the Malestrazza Building, and is greeted by Mary (Deborah Kara Unger), the caretaker. Sam tells Mary she will be staying in one of the apartments in the building. Jimmy (Cameron Bright), the caretaker's teenage son, takes her bags to her apartment and explains the rules of the building. She is to stay off the eighth floor because it is Malestrazza's and the roof because it is too dangerous. Sam researches the building and discovers that it was the scene of a horrible series of murders where sixteen people were entombed in the walls. Jimmy takes Sam to the eighth floor and tells her how his father was one of the victims, the crime being blamed on a local factory worker. The lights go out, and Sam cuts her leg after panicking in the darkness. Later, Jimmy washes her wound and begins to caress her thigh, but she tells him to stop. Sam begins having nightmares about being entombed in the walls. Sam's boyfriend arrives, causing Jimmy to grow jealous. While exploring the eighth floor, Sam and her boyfriend discover a secret passage which would allow someone to secretly view any of the apartments. Sam realizes that Jimmy has been spying on her. Later, as Sam and her boyfriend make love, Jimmy watches from behind the walls. The next morning they find his dog, butchered. Sam and her boyfriend agree to leave. Jimmy gives Sam a copy of the journal of Malestrazza, the building's architect. Sam realizes from reading the journal that there must be a large, open space in the center of the building. Jimmy goes to the roof to look for an opening to the hidden space. When he does not return, Sam and her boyfriend follow. They discover a massive shaft in the center of the building. They hear Jimmy calling from down in the shaft, saying that he is hurt. Sam has her boyfriend lower her into the shaft on a rope, but he is shot and killed, causing Sam to fall to the bottom. Jimmy then mails Sam's demolition report and sinks her car into a lake. Sam awakens at the bottom of the shaft and discovers that a man is there with her. He is Malestrazza, the architect, who has been trapped there by Jimmy. He tells her that Jimmy is keeping her down there until she learns to love him. Sam also learns that Malestrazza was the mastermind behind the murders and is dumbfounded that people believe that a factory worker could concoct such a scheme of entombing people. He also tells her that if he does what Jimmy wants, Jimmy is nice, but can be very cruel and imaginative when he disobeys Jimmy's orders. Jimmy is back at the hole and sends down a cassette tape. Malestrazza plays the tape, and Jimmy says that he wants to see Sam and Malestrazza dance. Sam reluctantly dances, but, when Jimmy tells them to kiss, she refuses. Malestrazza pulls her close and forces her to kiss him. After a few seconds, Jimmy tells them to stop and threatens Malestrazza not to touch Sam again. He sends down a basket with food, water, and a two-way radio. He tells Sam to keep the radio with her so that they can talk and be close. Sam looks for a way to escape and realizes one wall leads to the garbage area. When Jimmy returns, she lies and says that she is hurt and needs medicine. When Jimmy brings her the medicine, she opens the capsules and starts creating a mix to try and blow out the wall to get into the garbage room. Sam's attempt fails, and Jimmy is upset that she tried to escape. Before Jimmy could exact his punishment, his mother, Mary, catches him. Mary realizes that Sam is in the hole with Malestrazza. Mary tells Jimmy that place was for the architect not for anyone else. She realizes that Sam must stay in the hole with Malestrazza, or else they'll take her away and Jimmy will be an orphan. Sam is stuck in the hole with Malestrazza, who she realizes does not want to escape. This is his tomb, and he picked her to kill him. She eventually does kill him after some taunting, and he thanks her after he falls into his tomb and it begins to fill with cement. Sam is by the wall hoping that Jimmy will come through and save her. The demolition team arrives and her father asks where Sam is. Mary tells him that she left. Her father says that he thought she would want to see her first building being demolished. Mary is keeping Jimmy calm as they set up and begin to install the explosives. As the countdown begins, Jimmy starts saying \\"Sam,\\" and then screams her name and runs toward the building. Sam's father tells them to stop the countdown. At the roof, Jimmy looks down, and her father asks what they have done. Jimmy then throws himself over, killing himself, and lands next to Sam. Sam is then lifted out of the hole and put in an ambulance. Sam narrates that Malestrazza built 27 buildings and that they are all still standing. He considered the Malestrazza building his masterpiece. The building will not be demolished. ==CastRelease== The film premiered at the Glasgow Film Festival on 20 February 2009.Walled In Glasgow Film Festival The film received a straight-to-DVD release in North America on 17 March 2009.Walled In UHM There is also an accompanying graphic novel by the same name produced by Spacedog, published through Ape Entertainment, and available in April, 2009.

The witch-cult hypothesis states that such stories are based upon a real-life pagan cult that revered a horned god. The witch-cult hypothesis is a discredited theory that proposes that the witch trials of the Early Modern period were an attempt to suppress a pre-Christian, pagan religion that had survived the Christianisation of Europe. According to its proponents, the witch cult revolved around the worship of a Horned God of fertility, the underworld, the hunt and the hunted, whose Christian persecutors referred to him as the Devil, and whose followers participated in nocturnal rites at the witches' Sabbath. The theory was pioneered by two German scholars, Karl Ernst Jarcke and Franz Josef Mone, in the early nineteenth century, and was adopted by the French historian Jules Michelet, the American feminist Matilda Joslyn Gage, and the American folklorist Charles Leland later in that century. The hypothesis received its most prominent exposition when it was adopted by a British Egyptologist, Margaret Murray, who presented her version of it in The Witch-Cult in Western Europe (1921), before further expounding it in books such as The God of the Witches (1931) and in her contribution to the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Although the \\"Murrayite theory\\" proved popular among sectors of academia and the general public in the early and mid-twentieth century, it was never accepted by specialists in the Early Modern witch trials, who publicly discredited it through in-depth research conducted in the 1960s and 1970s. Specialists in Europe's Early Modern witchcraft beliefs view the pagan witch-cult theory as pseudohistorical. There is an academic consensus among experts that those accused and executed as witches during the period were not followers of any witch religion, whether pre-Christian or Satanic in nature. Critics highlight that the theory rested on a highly selective use of the evidence from the trials, thereby heavily misrepresenting the events and the actions of both the accused and their accusers. Further, they point out that it relied on the erroneous assumption that the claims made by accused witches were truthful, and not distorted by coercion and torture. They also note that, despite claims that the witch cult was a pre-Christian survival, there is no evidence of such a pagan witch cult throughout the intervening Middle Ages. The witch-cult hypothesis influenced literature, being adapted into fictional forms in works by John Buchan, Robert Graves and others. It greatly affected the origins of Wicca, a contemporary Pagan new religious movement that emerged in mid- twentieth-century Britain, claiming to be the survival of the pagan witch- cult. Since the 1960s, Carlo Ginzburg and other scholars have argued that surviving elements of pre-Christian religion in European folk culture influenced the Early Modern stereotypes of witchcraft, but scholars still debate how this may relate, if at all, to the Murrayite witch-cult hypothesis. ==Early modern precedents== The witch-hunt of the 16th and 17th centuries was an organized effort by authorities in many countries to destroy a supposed conspiracy of witches thought to pose a deadly threat to Christendom. According to these authorities, witches were numerous, and in conscious alliance with Satan, forming a sort of Satanic counter-religion. Witch-hunts in this sense must be separated from the belief in witches, the evil eye, and other such phenomena, which are common features of folk belief worldwide. The belief that witches are not just individual villains but conspirators organized in a powerful but well-hidden cult is a distinguishing feature of the early modern witch-hunt. This idea of an organized witch-cult originates in the second half of the 15th century, notoriously expounded in the 1486 Malleus Maleficarum. In the following two centuries, witch trials usually included the charge of membership in a demonic conspiracy, gathering in sabbaths, and similar. It was only with the beginning Age of Enlightenment in the early 18th century, that the idea of an organized witch-cult was abandoned. Early Modern testimonies of accused witches \\"confirming\\" the existence of a witch cult are considered doubtful. Norman Cohn has argued that such testimonies were often given under torture, and that their details were determined mainly by the expectations of the interrogators and by free association on the part of the accused, reflecting only the popular imagination of the times.Cohn, Norman (1977) Europe's Inner Demons Carlo Ginzburg and √âva P√≥cs hold that some of these testimonies can still give insights into the belief systems of the accused. Ginzburg discovered records of a group calling themselves benandanti, the \\"good walkers\\" who believed that they combatted witches (streghe) by magical means. The benandanti were persecuted for heresy in the period of 1575 to 1675.Ginzburg, Carlo. Ecstasies: Deciphering the Witches' Sabbath. ==The early theoryJarcke and Mone=== Throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the common belief among educated sectors of the European populace was that there had never been any genuine cult of witches and that all those persecuted and executed as such had been innocent of the crime. At this time, two figures independently raised the prospect that the witch trials had been influenced by stereotypes and folk customs that had pre-Christian origins. In his 1749 work Del Congresso Notturno delle Lamie (On the Nocturnal Meeting of Witches), the Italian cleric Girolamo Tartarotti claimed that the stereotype of the witch in Early Modern Europe was influenced by pre-Christian folk beliefs. Similar ideas were echoed by the German folklorist Jacob Grimm in his Deutsche Mythologie (Teutonic Mythology), first published in 1835. Here, he claimed that the witch stereotype reflected a blending of pre-Christian folk traditions with the later Medieval views of heresy. Both Tartarotti and Grimm would subsequently be erroneously cited as claiming that the witches had been members of a surviving pre-Christian cult. The first modern scholar to advance the claim that the witch trials had been designed to wipe out an anti- Christian sect was the German Karl Ernst Jarcke, a professor of criminal law at the University of Berlin. In 1828 he edited the records of a seventeenth- century German witch trial for publication in a legal journal, and included the theory in his own comments. Jarcke suggested that witchcraft had been a pre-Christian religion that survived Christianisation among the rural population, but that after being condemned as Satanism by the Church, it eventually degenerated into genuine Devil-worship and malevolence. At that point, the wider population came to reject it, resulting in the trials. This theory exonerated the Christian Church of blame by asserting that they had been acting on the wishes of the population, while at the same time not accepting the literal intervention of the Devil in human affairs which liberal rationalists disbelieved. In 1832, Felix Mendelssohn adopted similar ideas when composing his orchestral piece, Die Erste Walpurgisnacht, in which a group of pagan villagers pretend to be witches in order to scare away Christians intent on disrupting their Walpurgis Night festivities. Jarcke's theories were adopted and altered by the German historian Franz Josef Mone in 1839. While serving as director of archives at Baden, he published his ideas in a paper in which he asserted that the pre-Christian religion which degenerated into Satanic witchcraft was not Germanic in origin, but had instead been practised by slaves who had come in contact with the Greek cults of Hecate and Dionysus on the north coast of the Black Sea. According to Mone, these slaves adopted these cults and fused them with their own pagan faiths to form witchcraft, a religion that venerated a goat-like god, celebrated nocturnal orgies and practised poisoning and malevolent magic. This horrified the free-born population both in the pagan period and the Christian era, eventually resulting in the witch trials. However, as English historian Norman Cohn asserted in 1975, \\"neither of [Jarcke or Mone's] theories are convincing\\", with neither being able to show any evidence of pre-Christian gods being worshipped in Early Modern Germany or being able to explain why there was no accounts of this witch-cult in between the Christianization and the trials themselves. Both Jarcke and Mone were politically conservative, and their depiction of the threatening witch-cult would have had parallels with the widespread conservative fear of secret societies as bringers of revolution and irreligion in early nineteenth-century Europe. ===Michelet, Gage, and Leland=== 1899 cover of Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches In 1862, French historian Jules Michelet published La Sorci√®re (The Witch), in which he adapted the theory further. Michelet, who was a liberal and who despised both the Roman Catholic Church and absolute monarchies, claimed that the Witch Cult had been practiced by the peasants in opposition to Roman Catholicism, which was practiced by the upper classes.A New History of Witchcraft, Russell & Alexander, Thames & Hudson, page 147 He claimed that the witches had been mostly women (he greatly admired the feminine gender, once claiming that it was the superior of the two), and that they had been great healers, whose knowledge was the basis of much of modern medicine.The Triumph of the Moon - The Rise of Modern Pagan Witchcraft, Ronald Hutton, page 140 He believed that they worshiped the god Pan, who had become equated with the Christian figure of the Devil over time.The Triumph of the Moon - The Rise of Modern Pagan Witchcraft, Ronald Hutton, Oxford University Press, 1999, page 140 When Michelet's La Sorci√®re was first published in France, it was, according to historian Ronald Hutton, \\"greeted with silence from French literary critics, apparently because they recognized that it was not really history\\". In 1893, an American suffragist, Matilda Joslyn Gage, published Woman, Church and State, in which she claimed that in the prehistoric world, humanity had been matriarchal, worshiping a great Goddess, and that the witches of the witch cult had been pagan priestesses preserving this religion.The Triumph of the Moon - The Rise of Modern Pagan Witchcraft, Ronald Hutton, Oxford University Press, 1999, page 141 In 1897, the English scholar Karl Pearson, who was the professor of Applied Mathematics at University College London and an amateur historian and anthropologist, expanded on Michelet's theory. Pearson agreed with the theory of a prehistoric matriarchal society, and concurred with Gage that the witch-cult was a survival of it. Pearson theorized that during the Christian era, the religion began to emphasise the male deity, which was then equated with the Christian Devil. Pearson also made the claim that Joan of Arc had been one of the last few priestesses of the religion. He was, however, unlike Michelet or Gage, opposed to the group and to Goddess worship in general, believing that it was primitive and savage.The Triumph of the Moon - The Rise of Modern Pagan Witchcraft, Ronald Hutton, Oxford University Press, 1999, page 149-150 Charles Leland was an American folklorist and occultist who travelled around Europe in the latter 19th century and was a supporter of Michelet's theories. In 1899 he published Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches, which he claimed had been a sacred text for Italian witches. It made no mention of a horned god, but did mention a male deity known as Lucifer, as well as a female deity, the goddess Diana. Leland's work would provide much of the inspiration for the neopagan witchcraft religion of Stregheria. ==The impact of Margaret Murray== In 1915, Margaret Murray was an Egyptologist who worked under Sir Flinders Petrie at University College London. However, the outbreak of World War I had meant that many of their staff and students had abandoned scholarship to aid the British war effort, while archaeological excavation to Egypt had been rendered impossible. These events gave Murray more latitude in her studies, and she began to branch out and explore other interests. To aid Britain's war effort, Murray enrolled as a volunteer nurse in the Volunteer Aid Detachment of the College Women's Union Society, and for several weeks was posted to Saint-Malo in France. However, after being taken ill herself, she was sent to recuperate in Glastonbury, Somerset, where she became interested in Glastonbury Abbey and the folklore surrounding it which connected it to the legendary figure of King Arthur and to the idea that the Holy Grail had been brought there by Joseph of Aramathea. Pursuing this interest, she published the paper \\"Egyptian Elements in the Grail Romance\\" in the journal Ancient Egypt, although few agreed with her conclusions and it was criticised by scholars like Jessie Weston for making unsubstantiated leaps with the evidence. Returning to London, she began to work on the concept of witchcraft. Her first published work on the subject was an article in the academic journal Folklore in 1917, which she followed with a second in 1920. Further articles on the subject appeared in the journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute and the Scottish Historical Review.The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft, Ronald Hutton, page 195 ===The Witch-Cult in Western Europe: 1921=== Bust of Murray held in the library of the UCL Institute of Archaeology. In The Witch-Cult in Western Europe, Murray stated that she had restricted her research to Great Britain, although made some recourse to sources from France, Flanders, and New England. She drew a division between what she termed \\"Operative Witchcraft\\", which referred to the performance of charms and spells with any purpose, and \\"Ritual Witchcraft\\", by which she meant \\"the ancient religion of Western Europe\\", a fertility-based faith that she also termed \\"the Dianic cult\\". She claimed that the cult had \\"very probably\\" once been devoted to the worship of both a male deity and a \\"Mother Goddess\\" but that \\"at the time when the cult is recorded the worship of the male deity appears to have superseded that of the female\\". In her thesis, Murray claimed that the figure referred to as the Devil in the trial accounts was the witches' god, \\"manifest and incarnate\\", to whom the witches' offered their prayers. She claimed that at the witches' meetings, the god would be personified, usually by a man or at times by a woman or an animal; when a human personified this entity, Murray claimed that they were usually dressed plainly, though they appeared in full costume for the witches' Sabbaths. Members joined the cult either as children or adults through what Murray called \\"admission ceremonies\\"; Murray asserted that applicants had to agree to join of their own free will, and agree to devote themselves to the service of their deity. She also claimed that in some cases, these individuals had to sign a covenant or were baptized into the faith. At the same time, she claimed that the religion was largely passed down hereditary lines. Murray described the religion as being divided into covens containing thirteen members, led by a coven officer who was often termed the \\"Devil\\" in the trial accounts, but who was accountable to a \\"Grand Master\\". According to Murray, the records of the coven were kept in a secret book, with the coven also disciplining its members, to the extent of executing those deemed traitors. Describing this witch-cult as \\"a joyous religion\\", she claimed that the two primary festivals that it celebrated were on May Eve and November Eve, although that other dates of religious observation were 1 February and 1 August, the winter and summer solstices, and Easter. She asserted that the \\"General Meeting of all members of the religion\\" were known as Sabbaths, while the more private ritual meetings were known as Esbats. Murray claimed that these Esbats were nocturnal rites that began at midnight, and that they were \\"primarily for business, whereas the Sabbath was purely religious.\\" At the former, magical rites were performed both for malevolent and benevolent ends. She also asserted that the Sabbath ceremonies involved the witches' paying homage to the deity, renewing their \\"vows of fidelity and obedience\\" to him, and providing him with accounts of all the magical actions that they had conducted since the previous Sabbath. Once this business had been concluded, admissions to the cult or marriages were conducted; ceremonies and fertility rites took place; and the Sabbath concluded with feasting and dancing. The Devil on horseback. Nuremberg Chronicle (1493). Deeming Ritual Witchcraft to be \\"a fertility cult\\", she asserted that many of its rites were designed to ensure fertility and rain-making. She claimed that there were four types of sacrifice performed by the witches: blood-sacrifice, in which the neophyte writes their name in blood, the sacrifice of animals, the sacrifice of a non- Christian child to procure magical powers, and the sacrifice of the witches' god by fire to ensure fertility. She interpreted accounts of witches' shapeshifting into various animals as being representative of a rite in which the witches dressed as specific animals which they took to be sacred. She asserted that accounts of familiars were based on the witches' use of animals, which she divided into \\"divining familiars\\" used in divination and \\"domestic familiars\\" used in other magic rites. Murray asserted that paganism had survived the Christianization process in Britain, although that it came to be \\"practised only in certain places and among certain classes of the community.\\" She believed that folkloric stories of fairies in Britain were based on a surviving race of dwarves, who continued to live in the island up until the Early Modern period. She asserted that this race followed the same pagan religion as the witches, thus explaining the folkloric connection between the two. In the appendices to the book, she also alleged that Joan of Arc and Gilles de Rais were members of the witch-cult and were executed for it, a claim which has been refuted by historians, especially in the case of Joan of Arc.Pernoud, Regine. \\"Joan of Arc By Herself And Her Witnesses\\", pp. 16-20, 56, 65, 87, 155. Later historian Ronald Hutton commented that The Witch-Cult in Western Europe \\"rested upon a small amount of archival research, with extensive use of printed trial records in 19th century editions, plus early modern pamphlets and works of demonology\\". He also noted that the book's tone was generally \\"dry and clinical, and every assertion was meticulously footned to a source, with lavish quotation.\\" It was not a best seller; in its first thirty years, only 2,020 copies were sold. However, it led many people to treat Murray as an authority on the subject; in 1929, she was invited to provide the entry on \\"Witchcraft\\" for the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, and used it to present her interpretation of the subject as if it were universally accepted in scholarship. It remained in the encyclopedia until being replaced in 1968. ===The God of the Witches: 1931=== Murray followed this book with The God of the Witches in 1931; although similar in content, it was aimed at a mass market audience and published by the popular press Sampson Low. Whereas the tone in The Witch-Cult in Western Europe had been \\"dry and academic, the second bubbles with enthusiasm\\", as her language becomes \\"emotionally inflated and coloured with religious phraseology\\"; in particular she refers repeatedly to the cult as \\"the Old Religion\\". In this work she \\"cut out or toned down\\" many of the claims of her previous book which would have painted the cult in a bad light, for instance regarding animal and child sacrifice, and also omitted any mention of sex. In this book she began to refer to the witches' deity as the Horned God, and asserted that it was an entity who had been worshipped in Europe since the Palaeolithic. She further asserted that in the Bronze Age, the worship of the deity could be found throughout Europe, Asia, and parts of Africa, claiming that the depiction of various horned figures from these societies proved that. Among the evidence cited were the horned figures found at Mohenjo-Daro, which are often interpreted as depictions of Pashupati, as well as the deities Osiris and Amon in Egypt and the Minotaur of Minoan Crete. Within continental Europe, she claimed that the Horned God was represented by Pan in Greece, Cernunnos in Gaul, and in various Scandinavian rock carvings. Claiming that this divinity had been declared the Devil by the Christian authorities, she nevertheless asserted that his worship was testified in officially Christian societies right through to the Modern period, citing folkloric practices such as the Dorset Ooser and the Puck Fair as evidence of his veneration. ===The Divine King in England: 1954=== In 1954, she published The Divine King in England, in which she greatly extended on the theory, taking in an influence from Sir James Frazer's The Golden Bough, an anthropological book that made the claim that societies all over the world sacrificed their kings to the deities of nature. In her book, she claimed that this practice had continued into medieval England, and that, for instance, the death of William II was really a ritual sacrifice. She also claimed that a number of important figures who died violent deaths, such as Archbishop Thomas Becket, were killed as a replacement for the king.Murray, M.A. The Divine King in England No academic took the book seriously, and it was ignored by many of her supporters. It did however influence a few historical novels e.g. Philip Lindsay's The Devil and King John. ===Academic reception: 1921‚Äì63=== Upon initial publication, Murray's thesis gained a favourable reception from many readers, including a number of significant scholars, albeit none of whom were experts in the witch trials. Historians of Early Modern Britain like Sir George Clark and Christopher Hill incorporated her theories into their work, although Hill later publicly regretted doing so.Pp 191-2 Writing witch-hunt histories : challenging the paradigm / edited by Marko Nenonen and Raisa Maria Toivo. Boston Brill, 2013. For the 1961 reprint of The Witch-Cult in Western Europe, Medieval historian Steven Runciman provided a foreword in which he accepted that some of Murray's \\"minor details may be open to criticism\\", but in which he was otherwise supportive of her thesis. Her theories were recapitulated by Pennethorne Hughes in his 1952 book Witches. It was also adopted and championed by the archaeologist T. C. Lethbridge, marking his increasing estrangement from mainstream academia; in turn, Murray publicly defended his controversial theories regarding the chalk hill figures of Wandlebury Hill in the Gog Magog Hills, Cambridgeshire. As a result, a commentator writing in 1962 could comment that the Murrayite interpretations of the witch trials \\"seem to hold, at the time of writing, an almost undisputed sway at the higher intellectual levels\\", being widely accepted among \\"educated people\\". Canadian historian Elliot Rose suggested that the reason why Murray's theory gained such support was partly because of her \\"imposing credentials\\" as a member of staff at UCL, a position that lent her theory greater legitimacy in the eyes of many readers. He further suggested that the Murrayite view was attractive to many as it confirmed \\"the general picture of pre-Christian Europe a reader of Frazer or [Robert] Graves would be familiar with\\". Similarly, Hutton suggested that the cause of the Murrayite theory's popularity was because it \\"appealed to so many of the emotional impulses of the age\\", including \\"the notion of the English countryside as a timeless place full of ancient secrets\\", the literary popularity of Pan, the widespread belief that the majority of British had remained pagan long after the process of Christianisation, and the idea that folk customs represented pagan survivals. At the same time, Hutton suggested, it seemed more plausible to many than the previously dominant rationalist idea that the witch trials were the result of mass delusion. Related to this, folklorist Jacqueline Simpson suggested that part of the Murrayite theory's appeal was that it appeared to give a \\"sensible, demystifying, liberating approach to a longstanding but sterile argument\\" between the rationalists who denied that there had been any witches and those, like Montague Summers, who insisted that there had been a real Satanic conspiracy against Christendom in the Early Modern period replete with witches with supernatural powers. As Hilda Ellis Davidson noted; \\"how refreshing and exciting her first book was at that period. A new approach, and such a surprising one.\\" Nevertheless, Murray's theories never received support from experts in the Early Modern witch trials, and from her early publications onward many of her ideas were challenged by those who highlighted her \\"factual errors and methodological failings\\". Indeed, the majority of scholarly reviews of her work produced at the time were largely critical. George L. Burr critically reviewed both of her initial books on the subject for the American Historical Review. In his review of The Witch-Cult in Western Europe he asserted that she was not acquainted with the \\"careful general histories by modern scholars\\" and criticised her for assuming that the trial accounts accurately reflected the accused witches' genuine experiences of witchcraft, regardless of whether those confessions had been obtained through torture and coercion. He also charged her with selectively using the evidence to serve her interpretation, for instance by omitting any supernatural or miraculous events that appear in the trial accounts. As Pagan studies scholar Catherine Noble later put it, \\"Burr has hardly a kind word for Murray\\". One of the foremost specialists of the trial records, L'Estrange Ewen, brought out a series of books specialising in the archival material which rejected Murray's ideas. In 1938 Ewen launched a vociferous attack on Murray's scholarship, dismissing her theory as \\"vapid balderdash\\".C. L'Estrange Ewen (1938) Some Witchcraft Criticism: A Plea for the Blue Pencil. London: C. L. Ewen. Similarly, W.R. Halliday reviewed her work for the Folklore journal and exposed the flaws in her use of sources. E. M. Loeb criticised her in his review of The Witch-Cult in Western Europe for American Anthropologist. In Noble's words, \\"There is no constructive criticism between peers here; it is a frontal attack on an author Loeb clearly believes has no place among published historians, at least on the topic of witchcraft.\\" In his 1962 work A Razor for a Goat, Rose asserted that Murray's books on the witch- cult \\"contain an incredible number of minor errors of fact or of calculation and several inconsistencies of reasoning.\\" He accepted that her case \\"could, perhaps, still be proved by somebody else, though I very much doubt it.\\" Highlighting that there is a gap of about a thousand years between the Christianisation of Britain and the start of the witch trials there, he asserts that there is no evidence for the existence of the witch-cult anywhere in the intervening period. He further criticises her for treating pre- Christian Britain as a socially and culturally monolithic entity, whereas in reality it contained a diverse array of societies and religious beliefs. In addition to this, he challenged Murray's claim that the majority of Britons in the Middle Ages remained pagan as \\"a view grounded on ignorance alone\\". Simpson noted that despite these critical reviews, within the field of British folkloristics Murray's theories were permitted \\"to pass unapproved but unchallenged, either out of politeness or because nobody was really interested enough to research the topic.\\" As evidence, she noted that no substantial research articles on the subject of witchcraft were published in the journal Folklore between Murray's in 1917 and Rossell Hope Robbins' in 1963. However, she also highlighted that when regional studies of British folklore were published in this period by folklorists like Theo Brown, Ruth Tongue, or Enid Porter, none adopted the Murrayite framework for interpreting witchcraft beliefs, thus evidencing her claim that Murray's theories were widely ignored by scholars of folklore. Murray did not respond directly to the criticisms of her work, but did react to her critics in a hostile manner; in later life she asserted that she eventually ceased reading reviews of her work, and believed that her critics were simply acting on religious prejudice. Noble later stated that Murray \\"repeatedly dismissed [her critics] in print as close-minded, bigoted, or uninformed.\\" ===Academic reception: 1963‚Äìpresent=== Murray's work came to be increasingly criticised following her death in 1963, with the definitive academic rejection of the Murrayite witch-cult theory occurring during the 1970s. At this time, a variety of scholars across Europe and North America - such as Alan Macfarlane, Erik Midelfort, William Monter, Robert Muchembled, Gerhard Schormann, Bente Alver and Bengt Ankarloo - began to publish in-depth studies of the archival records from the witch trials, leaving no doubt that those tried for witchcraft were not practitioners of a surviving pre-Christian religion. In his 1971 book Religion and the Decline of Magic, English historian Keith Thomas dismissed Murray's thesis when he asserted that scholarship on the Early Modern witch trials had established that there was \\"very little evidence to suggest that the accused witches were either devil-worshippers or members of a pagan fertility cult\\". Although accepting that when she first published her ideas, they were \\"the best alternative\\" to the dominant \\"rationalist\\" view of witchcraft as \\"total delusion\\", he stated that her conclusions were \\"almost totally groundless\\" because she ignored the systematic study of the trial accounts provided by Ewen and instead used sources very selectively to argue her point. In his 1975 book Europe's Inner Demons, English historian Norman Cohn commented on the \\"extraordinary\\" manner in which Murray's theory had come to \\"exercise considerable influence\\" within scholarship. Cohn was nevertheless highly critical; he asserted that Murray's \\"knowledge of European history, even of English history, was superficial and her grasp of historical method was non- existent.\\" Furthermore, he added that her ideas were \\"firmly set in an exaggerated and distorted version of the Frazerian mould.\\" That same year, the Romanian historian of religion Mircea Eliade, writing in the History of Religions journal, described Murray's work as \\"hopelessly inadequate\\" and full of \\"numberless and appalling errors\\". He added that from the perspective of a historian of religion, \\"her use of comparative materials and, in general, the methods of Religionswissenschaft have been unfortunate.\\" In 1994, the English folklorist Jacqueline Simpson devoted a paper in the Folklore journal to the subject of \\"Margaret Murray: Who Believed Her, and Why?\\". She noted that the Murrayite theory was \\"based on deeply flawed methods and illogical arguments\\" and that the discipline of folkloristics had been damaged by its association with Murray, who had been appointed President of the Folklore Society. Simpson outlined how Murray had selected her use of evidence very specifically, particularly by ignoring and/or rationalising any accounts of supernatural or miraculous events in the trial records, thereby distorting the events that she was describing. Thus, Simpson pointed out, Murray rationalised claims that the cloven-hoofed Devil appeared at the witches' Sabbath by stating that he was a man with a special kind of shoe, and similarly asserted that witches' claims to have flown through the air on broomsticks were actually based on their practice of either hopping along on broomsticks or smearing hallucinogenic salves onto themselves. In 1996, historian Diane Purkiss asserted that Murray's thesis was \\"intrinsically improbable\\" and that it \\"commands little or no allegiance within the modern academy\\". She nevertheless felt that male scholars like Thomas, Cohn, and Macfarlane had committed \\"ritual slaughter\\" when setting up their own histories of witchcraft by condemning Murray's. In doing so, she identified a trend for them to contrast their own perceived methodologically sound and sceptical interpretations with Murray's \\"feminised belief\\" about the witch-cult, hence ignoring any theoretical considerations regarding the male-centric nature of their own perspectives. In his 1999 book The Triumph of the Moon, Hutton asserted that Murray had treated her source material with \\"reckless abandon\\", in that she had taken \\"vivid details of alleged witch practices\\" from \\"sources scattered across a great extent of space and time\\" and then declared them to be normative of the cult as a whole. Concurring with this assessment, historian Jeffrey B. Russell and Brooks Alexander stated that \\"Murray's use of sources in general is appalling\\". They went on to assert that \\"Today, scholars are agreed that Murray was more than just wrong - she was completely and embarrassingly wrong on nearly all of her basic premises.\\" In his sociological study of the Early Modern witchcraft, Gary Jensen highlighted that Murray's work had been \\"seriously challenged\\" and that it did not take into account \\"why it took so long for the heretic witch to be invented and targeted\\", noting that had the Murrayite witch-cult been a reality, then it would have been persecuted throughout the Medieval and not just in the Early Modern period. ==Later writers== During the 1930s and 1940s, Heinrich Himmler organised a branch of the SS to undertake the largest survey of witch-hunt trial records in Europe ever taken, with the dual aim of using it as anti-Christian propaganda, to claim that the inquisition had been a repression of an indigenous V√∂lkisch Norse-Germanic nature religion, and as evidence for reconstructing that religion.Hans Sebald, \\"Nazi ideology redefining deviants: Witches, Himmler's witch-trial survey, and the case of the bishopric of Bamberg\\" in: Levack (ed.), New Perspectives on Witchcraft, Magic, and Demonology (2001), pp. 113ff. This prompted Stuart Clark to dub the Nazi regime \\"Europe's first and only 'pro-witch' government.\\"Clark, Stuart et al. The Period of the Witch Trials p. 14 One pamphlet, 1935's The Christian Witch-Craze,Friederike M√ºller-Reimerdes. Der christliche Hexenwahn. Gedanken zum religi√∂sen Freiheitskampf der deutschen Frau. claimed that the witch-hunts were an attempt to exterminate \\"Aryan womanhood\\".Magic and Superstition in Europe, Michael David Bailey, Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Inc, 2006, pp. 236-238 In 1985 Classical historian Georg Luck, in his Arcana Mundi: Magic and the Occult in the Greek and Roman Worlds, theorised that the origins of the witch-cult may have appeared in late antiquity as a faith primarily designed to worship the Horned God, stemming from the merging of Cernunnos, a horned god of the Celts, with the Greco-Roman Pan/Faunus, a combination of gods which he posits created a new deity, around which the remaining pagans, those refusing to convert to Christianity, rallied and that this deity provided the prototype for later Christian conceptions of the Devil, and his worshippers were cast by the Church as witches. While Murray's theory had received some negative critical attention at the time of its first publication, it was not until the 1950s and 1960s that her books became best sellers, reaching a larger audience and thereby subsequently causing experts to decide that \\"the Murray thesis had to be stopped once and for all\\".The Witch in History: Early Modern and Twentieth-Century Representations. Reviewed by Ronald Hutton. http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/paper/hutton.html ===Literature=== Simpson noted that the publication of the Murray thesis in the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica made it accessible to \\"journalists, film-makers popular novelists and thriller writers\\", who adopted it \\"enthusiastically\\". It influenced the work of Aldous Huxley and Robert Graves. ===Influence on occultism and contemporary Paganism=== The Murrayite thesis provided the blueprint for the contemporary Pagan religion of Wicca. In the 1950s, several British occultists claimed they had found remnants of the surviving Witch Cult. The first of these was Gerald Gardner, who claimed to have discovered a coven of such witches - the New Forest Coven, in 1939. Gardner said that he was concerned that the religion would die out, and so initiated more members into it through his Bricket Wood coven. The tradition that he started became Gardnerian Wicca. The New Forest witch Sybil Leek made a similar claim, stating that she followed the religion as many of her family had previously done, and a similar claim came from the Australian artist Rosaleen Norton, whose family had been of Welsh origin. Charles Cardell also made the claim of a hereditary lineage of the witch-cult, and he posited that the horned deity of the witches was known as Atho. Other Britons soon made the claim that they were members of a long line of family Witches. Robert Cochrane made such a claim, and ran a coven called the Clan of Tubal Cain; he inspired the founding of several movements, including the 1734 Tradition. Alex Sanders also made such a claim, and founded Alexandrian Wicca; however, Sanders turned out to be a Gardnerian initiate and had based Alexandrian ritual on Gardnerian Wicca.Sanders, Maxine (2008) Firechild; Hutton, Ronald (1999) Triumph of the Moon. In 1974 E.W. Lidell made the claim that the occultist Aleister Crowley had been initiated into the witch-cult in 1899 or 1900, after being introduced to it through Allan Bennett, a Golden Dawn friend of his. Lidell continued his claim by saying that the coven's High Priestess expelled Crowley for being \\"a dirty minded, evilly disposed, vicious little monster\\". No substantiating evidence has, however, been produced for this.Hutton, Ronald, (1999), The Triumph of the Moon - A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft, page 218, Oxford University Press ===Carlo Ginzburg and the benandanti=== From the 1960s Carlo Ginzburg documented the beliefs of a number of early modern groups of sorcerers, seers and healers. He claimed they were rooted in pre-Christian paganism, and credited Murray with a \\"correct intuition\\" in identifying the remnants of a pre-Christian 'religion of Diana', and in believing that witch-trial testimonies did at times represent actual or perceived experiences.Ginzburg, Carlo (1990) Ecstasies: Deciphering the Witches' Sabbath. London: Hutchinson Radius. p. 9. In the original Italian preface to I benandanti, published in 1966, Ginzburg discussed the work of Murray, claiming that although it contained \\"a kernel of truth\\", it had been \\"formulated in a wholly uncritical way\\", containing \\"serious defects\\".Ginzburg 1983. p. xix . With the complete academic rejection of Murray's theories in the 1970s, Ginzburg attempted to clarify his work's relationship to Murray's Witch-Cult theory in his \\"Preface to the English Edition\\", written in 1982. Here, he expressly stated that \\"Murray, in fact, asserted: (a) that witchcraft had its roots in an ancient fertility cult, and (b) that the sabbat described in the witchcraft trials referred to gatherings which had actually taken place. What my work really demonstrated, even if unintentionally, was simply the first point.\\"Ginzburg 1983. p. xiii. He added that although he rejected her ideas, there was a \\"kernel of truth\\" in Murray's thesis. Some historians have viewed Ginzburg's ideas as being related to Murray's; Hungarian historian G√°bor Klaniczay stated that \\"Ginzburg reformulated Murray's often fantastic and very inadequately documented thesis about the reality of the witches' Sabbath\\" and thus the publication of I Benandanti in 1966 \\"reopened the debate about the possible interconnections between witchcraft beliefs and the survival of pagan fertility cults\\". Similarly, Romanian historian of religion Mircea Eliade commented that while Ginzburg's presentation of the benandanti \\"does not substantiate Murray's entire thesis\\", it did represent a \\"well- documented case of the processus through which a popular and archaic secret cult of fertility is transformed into a merely magical, or even black-magical practice under the pressure of the Inquisition.\\" Historian of witchcraft Michael D. Bailey suggested that Ginzburg's work \\"somewhat revived\\" Murray's \\"discredited notion of witchcraft representing an ancient fertility religion\\". Conversely, other scholars drew a clear divide between the ideas of Murray and Ginzburg; in 1975, Cohn stated that Ginzburg's discovery had \\"nothing to do\\" with Murray's witch-cult hypothesis. Echoing these views, in 1999 English historian Ronald Hutton stated that Ginzburg's ideas regarding shamanistic fertility cults were actually \\"pretty much the opposite\\" of what Murray had posited. Hutton pointed out that Ginzburg's argument that \\"ancient dream- worlds, or operations on non-material planes of consciousness, helped to create a new set of fantasies at the end of the Middle Ages\\" differed strongly from Murray's argument that an organised religion of witches had survived from the pre-Christian era and that descriptions of witches' sabbaths were accounts of real events. The folklorist Juliette Wood stated that while Ginzburg articulated a \\"more sympathetic\\" stance to Murray's ideas than other specialists in the witch trials, he \\"does not propose anything approaching the pan-European cult which Murray advocated\\". ===Sabina Magliocco and the ostension=== In 2002 Sabina Magliocco theorized a middle way between Hutton's idea that pre-Christian elements in witchcraft were only legends, dreams or trance experiences and Murray's idea that there was an organized pagan witches' society, by stating that although being diffused as legends, witchcraft beliefs, as all the legends, \\"occasionally become dramatic enactments known as \\"ostension\\"\\".Sabina Magliocco (2002). 'Who Was Aradia? The History and Development of a Legend' in The Pomegranate: The Journal of Pagan Studies, Issue 18. Ostension, according to Magliocco, \\"always derives from a pre-existing legend, the legend precedes the existence of its enactment, therefore even if a group decided to enact aspects of the legend of Diana/ Herodias, it would not have been a revival of pre-Christian paganism, but an attempt to act out certain ritual aspects described in the legends. Moreover, the more magical aspects from the trial reports‚Äînight flights on the backs of animals, ever-replenishing banquets, resurrection of dead livestock‚Äîcould not have been achieved through ostension. We need to consider these as fantastical legend motifs, reports of experiences from trances or dreams, or both\\". Furthermore, Magliocco specifies that the accused of witchcraft who reported pagan themes such as the Society of Diana and Herodias \\"constituted only a small minority of all those accused of witchcraft\\". By taking the example of two women condemned as witches in Milan in 1390, Sibillia Zanni and Pierina de' Bugatis, she states that, even though \\"we have no proof such a society ever existed, it is not inconceivable that a few inspired individuals might have decided to dramatize, once or repeatedly, the gatherings described in legends\\" in Medieval and Early Modern Europe. A gathering based on legends of Diana and/or Herodias \\"would probably have been secret and limited to the friends and associates of the creative instigators, who might well have been folk healers. One or more women might even have played the role of Diana or Herodias, presiding over the gathering and giving advice. Feasting, drinking and dancing might have taken place, and the women may have exchanged advice on matters of healing and divination\\". ==See also== *History of Wicca *Stregheria *Horned God *Cult of Herodias ==ReferencesFootnotes=Bibliography=== : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : Category:Pseudohistory Category:Conspiracy theories Category:Witchcraft Category:Wicca ","title":"Witch-cult hypothesis"},{"id":"20198433","text":"George Allman (23 July 1930 ‚Äì September 2016) was an English footballer who played as a forward.

The invasion was a direct, if delayed, response to the defeat of the first Persian invasion of Greece (492‚Äì490 BC) at the Battle of Marathon, which ended Darius I's attempts to subjugate Greece. After Darius's death, his son Xerxes spent several years planning for the second invasion, mustering an enormous army and navy. The Athenians and Spartans led the Greek resistance. About a tenth of the Greek city-states joined the 'Allied' effort; most remained neutral or submitted to Xerxes. The invasion began in spring 480 BC, when the Persian army crossed the Hellespont and marched through Thrace and Macedon to Thessaly. The Persian advance was blocked at the pass of Thermopylae by a small Allied force under King Leonidas I of Sparta; simultaneously, the Persian fleet was blocked by an Allied fleet at the straits of Artemisium. At the famous Battle of Thermopylae, the Allied army held back the Persian army for three days, before they were outflanked by a mountain path and the Allied rearguard was trapped and annihilated. The Allied fleet had also withstood two days of Persian attacks at the Battle of Artemisium, but when news reached them of the disaster at Thermopylae, they withdrew to Salamis. After Thermopylae, all of Euboea, Phocis, Boeotia and Attica fell to the Persian army, which captured and burnt Athens. However, a larger Allied army fortified the narrow Isthmus of Corinth, protecting the Peloponnesus from Persian conquest. Both sides thus sought a naval victory that might decisively alter the course of the war. The Athenian general Themistocles succeeded in luring the Persian navy into the narrow Straits of Salamis, where the huge number of Persian ships became disorganised, and were soundly beaten by the Allied fleet. The Allied victory at Salamis prevented a quick conclusion to the invasion, and fearing becoming trapped in Europe, Xerxes retreated to Asia leaving his general Mardonius to finish the conquest with the elite of the army. The following spring, the Allies assembled the largest ever hoplite army, and marched north from the isthmus to confront Mardonius. At the ensuing Battle of Plataea, the Greek infantry again proved its superiority, inflicting a severe defeat on the Persians and killing Mardonius in the process. On the same day, across the Aegean Sea an Allied navy destroyed the remnants of the Persian navy at the Battle of Mycale. With this double defeat, the invasion was ended, and Persian power in the Aegean severely dented. The Greeks would now move to the offensive, eventually expelling the Persians from Europe, the Aegean islands and Ionia before the war finally came to an end in 479 BC. ==Sources== The main source for the Great Greco-Persian Wars is the Greek historian Herodotus. Herodotus, who has been called the 'Father of History',Cicero, On the Laws I, 5 was born in 484 BC in Halicarnassus, Asia Minor (then under Persian overlordship). He wrote his 'Enquiries' (Greek-- Historia; English--(The) Histories) around 440-430 BC, trying to trace the origins of the Greco-Persian Wars, which would still have been relatively recent history (the wars finally ending in 450 BC). Herodotus's approach was entirely novel, and at least in Western society, he does seem to have invented 'history' as we know it. As Holland has it: \\"For the first time, a chronicler set himself to trace the origins of a conflict not to a past so remote so as to be utterly fabulous, nor to the whims and wishes of some god, nor to a people's claim to manifest destiny, but rather explanations he could verify personally.\\"Holland, pp. xvi-xvii. Some subsequent ancient historians, despite following in his footsteps, criticised Herodotus, starting with Thucydides.Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War, e.g. I, 22Finley, p. 15. Nevertheless, Thucydides chose to begin his history where Herodotus left off (at the Siege of Sestos), and therefore evidently felt that Herodotus's history was accurate enough not to need re-writing or correcting. Plutarch criticised Herodotus in his essay \\"On The Malignity of Herodotus\\", describing Herodotus as \\"Philobarbaros\\" (barbarian-lover), for not being pro-Greek enough, which suggests that Herodotus might actually have done a reasonable job of being even-handed.Holland, p. xxiv. A negative view of Herodotus was passed on to Renaissance Europe, though he remained well read. However, since the 19th century his reputation has been dramatically rehabilitated by archaeological finds that have repeatedly confirmed his version of events.Holland, p. 377. The prevailing modern view is that Herodotus generally did a remarkable job in his Historia, but that some of his specific details (particularly troop numbers and dates) should be viewed with skepticism. Nevertheless, there are still some historians who believe Herodotus made up much of his story.Fehling, pp. 1-277. The Greek historian Diodorus Siculus from Sicily, writing in the 1st century BC in his Bibliotheca Historica, also provides an account of the Greco-Persian wars, partially derived from the earlier Greek historian Ephorus. This account is fairly consistent with Herodotus's.Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca Historica, XI, 28-34 The Greco- Persian wars are also described in less detail by a number of other ancient historians including Plutarch, Ctesias, and are alluded by other authors, such as the playwright Aeschylus. Archaeological evidence, such as the Serpent Column, also supports some of Herodotus's specific claims.Note to Herodotus IX, 81 ==Background== A map showing the Greek world at the time of the invasion The Greek city-states of Athens and Eretria had supported the unsuccessful Ionian Revolt against the Persian Empire of Darius I in 499‚Äì494 BC. The Persian Empire was still relatively young, and prone to revolts among its subject peoples.Holland, p. 47-55 Moreover, Darius was a usurper, and had spent considerable time extinguishing revolts against his rule. The Ionian revolt threatened the integrity of his empire, and Darius thus vowed to punish those involved (especially those not already part of the empire).Herodotus V, 105 Darius also saw the opportunity to expand his empire into the fractious world of Ancient Greece.Holland, 171-178 A preliminary expedition under Mardonius, in 492 BC, to secure the land approaches to Greece ended with the re-conquest of Thrace and forced Macedon to become a fully subordinate kingdom part of Persia.Herodotus VI, 44 It had previously been a vassal as early as the late 6th century BC, but remained having autonomy and not fully subordinate yet. The Spartans throw Persian envoys into a well. In 491 BC, Darius sent emissaries to all the Greek city-states, asking for a gift of 'earth and water' in token of their submission to him.Holland, pp. 178-179 Having had a demonstration of his power the previous year, the majority of Greek cities duly obliged. In Athens, however, the ambassadors were put on trial and then executed; in Sparta, they were simply thrown down a well. This meant that Sparta was also now effectively at war with Persia. However, in order to appease the Achaemenid king somewhat, two Spartans were voluntarily sent to Susa for execution, in atonement for the death of the Persian heralds.\\"Two Spartans of noble birth and great wealth, Sperthias son of Aneristus and Bulis son of Nicolaus, undertook of their own free will that they would make atonement to Xerxes for Darius' heralds who had been done to death at Sparta. Thereupon the Spartans sent these men to Media for execution.\\" in Darius thus put together an ambitious task force under Datis and Artaphernes in 490 BC, which attacked Naxos, before receiving the submission of the other Cycladic Islands. The task force then moved on Eretria, which it besieged and destroyed.Herodotus VI, 101 Finally, it moved to attack Athens, landing at the bay of Marathon, where it was met by a heavily outnumbered Athenian army. At the ensuing Battle of Marathon, the Athenians won a remarkable victory, which resulted in the withdrawal of the Persian army to Asia.Herodotus VI, 113 Darius therefore began raising a huge new army with which he meant to completely subjugate Greece; however, in 486 BC, his Egyptian subjects revolted, indefinitely postponing any Greek expedition.Holland, p. 203 Darius then died while preparing to march on Egypt, and the throne of Persia passed to his son Xerxes I.Holland, pp. 206-207 Xerxes crushed the Egyptian revolt, and very quickly restarted the preparations for the invasion of Greece.Holland, pp. 208-211 ==Persian preparations== Since this was to be a full-scale invasion, it required long- term planning, stock-piling and conscription. It was decided that Xerxes' Pontoon Bridges were to be set up to allow his army to cross the Hellespont to Europe, and that a canal should be dug across the isthmus of Mount Athos (rounding which headland, a Persian fleet had been destroyed in 492 BC). These were both feats of exceptional ambition, which would have been beyond any contemporary state.Holland, pp. 213-214 However, the campaign was delayed one year because of another revolt in Egypt and Babylonia.Herodotus VII, 7 In 481 BC, after roughly four years of preparation, Xerxes began to muster the troops for the invasion of Europe. Herodotus gives the names of 46 nations from which troops were drafted.Herodotus VII, 62‚Äì80 The Persian army was gathered in Asia Minor in the summer and autumn of 481 BC. The armies from the Eastern satrapies was gathered in Kritala, Cappadocia and were led by Xerxes to Sardis where they passed the winter.Herodotus VII, 26 Early in spring it moved to Abydos where it was joined with the armies of the western satrapies.Herodotus VII, 37 Then the army that Xerxes had mustered marched towards Europe, crossing the Hellespont on two pontoon bridges.Herodotus VII, 35 ===Size of the Persian forces=== Army The soldiers of Xerxes I, of all ethnicities,Soldiers with names, after Walser on the tomb of Xerxes I, at Naqsh-e Rostam.The Achaemenid Empire in South Asia and Recent Excavations in Akra in Northwest Pakistan Peter Magee, Cameron Petrie, Robert Knox, Farid Khan, Ken Thomas p.713 The numbers of troops that Xerxes mustered for the second invasion of Greece have been the subject of endless dispute, because the numbers given in ancient sources are very large indeed. Herodotus claimed that there were, in total, 2.5 million military personnel, accompanied by an equivalent number of support personnel. The poet Simonides, who was a contemporary, talks of four million; Ctesias, based on Persian records, gave 800,000 as the total number of the army (without the support personnel) that was assembled by Xerxes.Ctesias, Persica While it has been suggested that Herodotus or his sources had access to official Persian Empire records of the forces involved in the expedition, modern scholars tend to reject these figures based on knowledge of the Persian military systems, their logistical capabilities, the Greek countryside, and supplies available along the army's route. Modern scholars thus generally attribute the numbers given in the ancient sources to the result of miscalculations or exaggerations on the part of the victors, or disinformation by the Persians in the run up to the war. The topic has been hotly debated but the modern consensus revolves around the figure of 200,000 or 300,000-500,000. Nevertheless, whatever the real numbers were, it is clear that Xerxes was eager to ensure a successful expedition by mustering overwhelming numerical superiority by land and by sea, and also that much of the army died of starvation and disease, never returning to Asia.Herodotus VIII, 115 Herodotus tells us that the army and navy, while moving through Thrace, was halted at Doriskos for an inspection by Xerxes, and he recounts the numbers of troops found to be present:Herodotus VII, 59 {  border=\\"3\\" - !rowspan=1 width=\\"650\\"Units !rowspan=1 width=\\"100\\"Numbers - 1,207 triremes with 200-man crews from 12 ethnic groups: Phoenicians along with the \\"Syrians of Palestine\\" (likely Judeans), Egyptians,Herodotus VII, 89 Cyprians,Herodotus VII 90 Cilicians, Pamphylians, Lycians, Dorians of Asia, Carians, Ionians, Aegean islanders, Aeolians, Greeks from Pontus 241,400Herodotus VII, 184 - 30 marines per triremefrom the Persians, Medes or Sacae 36,210 - 3,000 Galleys, including 50-oar penteconters (80-man crew), 30-oared ships, light galleys and heavy horse- transports 240,000b -  Total of ships' complements  517,610 -  Infantry from 47 ethnic groups, including Medes, Cissians, Hyrcanians,Herodotus VII, 62 Assyrians, Chaldeans,Herodotus VII, 63 Bactrians, Sacae,Herodotus VII, 64 Indians,Herodotus VII, 65 Arians, Parthians, Chorasmians, Sogdians, Gandarians, Dadicae,Herodotus VII, 66 Caspians, Sarangae, Pactyes,Herodotus VII, 67 Utians, Mycians, Paricanians,Herodotus VII, 68 Arabians, Ethiopians of Africa,Herodotus VII, 69 Ethiopians of Baluchistan,Herodotus VII, 70 Libyans,Herodotus VII, 71 Paphlagonians, Ligyes, Matieni, Mariandyni, Cappadocians,Herodotus VII, 72 Phrygians, Armenians,Herodotus VII, 73 Lydians, Mysians,Herodotus VII, 74 Asian Thracians,Herodotus, VII, 75 Lasonii, Milyae,Herodotus VII, 77 Moschi, Tibareni, Macrones, Mossynoeci,Herodotus VII, 78 Mares, Colchians, Alarodians, SaspiriansHerodotus VII, 79 and Red Sea islanders.Herodotus VII, 80  1,700,000Herodotus VII, 60 -  Horse cavalry from the Persians,Herodotus VII, 84 Sagartians,Herodotus VII, 85 Medes, Cissians, Indians, Caspians and Paricanians.Herodotus VII, 86  80,000Herodotus VII, 87 -  Arab camel troops and Libyan charioteers  20,000 -  Total Asian land and sea forces 2,317,610Herodotus VII, 61 -  120 triremes with 200-man crews from the Greeks of Thrace and the islands near it.  24,000Herodotus VII, 185 -  Balkan infantry from 13 ethnic groups: European Thracians, Paeonians, Eordi, Bottiaei, Chalcidians, Brygians, Pierians, Macedonians, Perrhaebi, Enienes, Dolopes, Magnesians, Achaeans  300,000 -  Grand Total  2,641,610 } Herodotus doubles this number to account for support personnel and thus he reports that the whole army numbered 5,283,220 men.Herodotus VII, 186 Other ancient sources give similarly large numbers. The poet Simonides, who was a near-contemporary, talks of four million; Ctesias gave 800,000 as the total number of the army that assembled in Doriskos. Crossing the Hellespont by Xerxes with his huge army An early and very influential modern historian, George Grote, set the tone by expressing incredulity at the numbers given by Herodotus: \\"To admit this overwhelming total, or anything near to it, is obviously impossible.\\"Grote, ch. 38 Grote's main objection is the supply problem, though he does not analyse the problem in detail. He did not reject Herodotus's account altogether, citing the latter's reporting of the Persians' careful methods of accounting and their stockpiling of supply caches for three years, but drew attention to the contradictions in the ancient sources. A later influential historian, J. B. Bury, calls Herodotus's numbers \\"wholly fabulous\\" and judges that the Persian land forces may have been 180,000. A major limiting factor for the size of the Persian army, first suggested by Sir Frederick Maurice (a British transport officer) is the supply of water.Maurice (1930) Maurice suggested in the region of 200,000 men and 70,000 animals could have been supported by the rivers in that region of Greece. He further suggested that Herodotus may have confused the Persian terms for chiliarchy (1,000) and myriarchy (10,000), leading to an exaggeration by a factor of ten. Other early modern scholars estimated that the land forces participating in the invasion at 100,000 soldiers or less, based on the logistical systems available to the Ancients.Delbr√ºck (1920)Warry (1998)Engels (1978)Scott (1915)von FischerCohen, p. 164W. W. Tarn (1908)Ernst Obst (1914) Munro and Macan note Herodotus giving the names of six major commanders and 29 myriarchs (leaders of a baivabaram, the basic unit of the Persian infantry, which numbered about 10,000-strongPapademetriou (2005)Sekunda & Chew (1992)); this would give a land force of roughly 300,000 men.Munro (1929)Lazenby, p. 90 Other proponents of larger numbers suggest figures from 250,000 to 700,000.E Istorika, 19 October 2002 Fleet The size of the Persian fleet is also disputed, though perhaps less so.Holland, p. 394 According to Herodotus the Persian fleet numbered 1,207 triremes and 3,000 transport and supply ships, including 50-oared galleys (Penteconters) (œÄŒµŒΩœÑŒ∑Œ∫ŒøŒΩœÑŒÆœÅ).Herodotus VII, 97 Herodotus gives a detailed breakdown of the Persian triremes by nationality: Xerxes attending the lashing and \\"chaining\\" of the Hellespont (Illustration from 1909) {  !Region!!Number of ships!!Region!!Number of ships!!Region!!Number of ships -  Phoenicia and Syria  300  Egypt  200  Cyprus  150 -  Cilicia  100  Ionia  100  Pontus  100 -  Caria  70  Aeolia  60  Lycia  50 -  Pamphylia  30  Dorians from Asia Minor  30  Cyclades  17 -     Total1207 } Herodotus also records that this was the number at the Battle of Salamis, despite the losses earlier in storms off Sepia and Euboea, and at the battle of Artemisium. He claims that the losses were replenished with reinforcements, though he only records 120 triremes from the Greeks of Thrace and an unspecified number of ships from the Greek islands. Aeschylus, who fought at Salamis, also claims that he faced 1,207 warships there, of which 1,000 were triremes and 207 fast ships.Aeschylus, The Persians Diodorus Diodorus Siculus XI, 3 and LysiasLysias II, 27 independently claim there were 1,200 at Doriskos. The number of 1,207 (for the outset only) is also given by Ephorus,Ephorus, Universal History while his teacher Isocrates claims there were 1,300 at Doriskos and 1,200 at Salamis.Isocrates, Oration VII, 49Isocrates, Oration IV, 93 Ctesias gives another number, 1,000 ships, while Plato, speaking in general terms refers to 1,000 ships and more.Plato, Laws III, 699 These numbers are (by ancient standards) consistent, and this could be interpreted that a number around 1,200 is correct. Among modern scholars some have accepted this number, although suggesting that the number must have been lower by the Battle of Salamis.K√∂ster (1934)Holland, p. 320Lazenby, pp. 93-94 Other recent works on the Persian Wars reject this number--1,207 being seen as more of a reference to the combined Greek fleet in the Iliad--and generally claim that the Persians could have launched no more than around 600 warships into the Aegean.Green, p. 61Burn, p. 331 ==Greek preparations== Probable Spartan Hoplite, Vix krater, circa 500 BC. The Athenians had been preparing for war with the Persians since the mid-480s BC, and in 482 BC the decision was taken, under the guidance of the politician Themistocles, to build a massive fleet of triremes that would be necessary for the Greeks to fight the Persians.Holland, p. 217-223 The Athenians did not have the man- power to fight on land and sea; therefore combatting the Persians would require an alliance of several Greek city states. In 481 BC Xerxes sent ambassadors around Greece asking for earth and water, but making the very deliberate omission of Athens and Sparta.Herodotus VII, 32 Support thus began to coalesce around these two states. ===Hellenic alliance=== A congress of states met at Corinth in late autumn of 481 BC, and a confederate alliance of Greek city-states was formed.Herodotus VII, 145 This confederation had the power to send envoys asking for assistance and to dispatch troops from the member states to defensive points after joint consultation. Herodotus does not formulate an abstract name for the union but simply calls them \\"Œø·º± ·ºùŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒµœÇ\\" (the Greeks) and \\"the Greeks who had sworn alliance\\" (Godley translation) or \\"the Greeks who had banded themselves together\\" (Rawlinson translation).Herodotus, VII, 148 Hereafter, they will be referred to as the 'Allies'. Sparta and Athens had a leading role in the congress but interests of all the states played a part in determining defensive strategy.Herodotus VII, 161 Little is known about the internal workings of the congress or the discussions during its meetings. Only 70 of the approximately 700 Greek cities sent representatives. Nevertheless, this was remarkable for the disjointed Greek world, especially since many of the city-states in attendance were still technically at war with each other.Holland, p. 226 The majority of other city- states remained more-or-less neutral, awaiting the outcome of the confrontation.Holland, p. 225 Thebes was a major absentee, and was suspected of being willing to aid the Persians once the invasion force arrived.Holland, p. 263 Not all Thebans agreed with this policy, and 400 \\"loyalist\\" hoplites joined the Allied force at Thermopylae (at least according to one possible interpretation). The most notable city actively siding with the Persians (\\"Medised\\") was Argos, in the otherwise Spartan-dominated Peloponnese.Holland, pp. 246-247Holland, pp. 168-169 However, the Argives had been severely weakened in 494 BC, when a Spartan-force led by Cleomenes I had annihilated the Argive army in Battle of Sepeia and then massacred the fugitives. ===Size of allied forces=== The allies had no 'standing army', nor was there any requirement to form one; since they were fighting on home territory, they could muster armies as and when required. Different-sized allied forces thus appeared throughout the campaign. These numbers are discussed fully in the article for each battle. ==Spring 480 BC: Thrace, Macedonia and Thessaly== The ancient Achaemenid fort at Eion (hill to the left) and the mouth of the Strymon River (right), seen from Ennea Hodoi (Amphipolis). Having crossed into Europe in April 480 BC, the Persian army began its march to Greece. Five major food depots had been set up along the path: at White Headland on the Thracian side of the Hellespont, at Tyrodiza in Perinthian territory, at Doriskos at the Evros river estuary where the Asian army was linked up with the Balkan allies, at Eion on the Strymon river, and at Therme, modern-day Thessaloniki. There, food had been sent from Asia for several years in preparation for the campaign. Animals had been bought and fattened, while the local populations had, for several months, been ordered to grind the grains into flour.Herodotus VII, 25 The Persian army took roughly three months to travel unopposed from the Hellespont to Therme, a journey of about 600 km (360 mi). It paused at Doriskos where it was joined by the fleet. Xerxes reorganized the troops into tactical units replacing the national formations used earlier for the march.Herodotus VII, 100 The Allied 'congress' met again in the spring of 480 BC. A Thessalian delegation suggested that the allies could muster in the narrow Vale of Tempe, on the borders of Thessaly, and thereby block Xerxes's advance.Holland, 248-249 A force of 10,000 Allies led by the Spartan polemarch Euenetus and Themistocles was thus despatched to the pass. However, once there, they were warned by Alexander I of Macedon that the vale could be bypassed by at least two other passes, and that the army of Xerxes was overwhelming; the Allies therefore retreated.Herodotus VII, 173 Shortly afterwards, they received the news that Xerxes had crossed the Hellespont. The abandonment of Tempe meant that all of Thessaly submitted to the Persians, as did many cities to the north of the pass of Thermopylae when it seemed help was not forthcoming.Herodotus VII, 174 A second strategy was therefore suggested to the Allies by Themistocles. The route to southern Greece (Boeotia, Attica and the Peloponnesus) would require the army of Xerxes to travel through the very narrow pass of Thermopylae. This could easily be blocked by the Allies, despite the overwhelming number of Persians. Furthermore, to prevent the Persians bypassing Thermopylae by sea, the allied navy could block the straits of Artemisium. This dual strategy was adopted by the congress.Holland pp. 255-257 However, the Peloponnesian cities made fall- back plans to defend the Isthmus of Corinth should it come to it, while the women and children of Athens were evacuated en masse to the Peloponnesian city of Troezen.Herodotus VIII, 40 ==August 480 BC: Thermopylae and Artemisium== Battle of Thermopylae and movements to Salamis, 480 BC. When the Allies received the news that Xerxes was clearing paths around Mount Olympus, and thus intending to march towards Thermopylae, it was both the period of truce that accompanied the Olympic games, and the Spartan festival of Carneia, during both of which warfare was considered sacrilegious.Holland, pp 257-259 Nevertheless, the Spartans considered the threat so grave that they despatched their king Leonidas I with his personal bodyguard (the Hippeis) of 300 men (in this case, the elite young soldiers in the Hippeis were replaced by veterans who already had sons). Leonidas was supported by contingents from the Peloponnesian cities allied to Sparta, and other forces that were picked up en route to Thermopylae. The Allies proceeded to occupy the pass, rebuilt the wall the Phocians had built at the narrowest point of the pass, and waited for Xerxes's arrival.Holland, pp. 262-264 The pass of Thermopylae in modern times When the Persians arrived at Thermopylae in mid-August, they initially waited for three days for the Allies to disperse. When Xerxes was eventually persuaded that the Allies intended to contest the pass, he sent his troops to attack.Herodotus VII, 210 However, the Greek position was ideally suited to hoplite warfare, the Persian contingents being forced to attack the phalanx head on.Holland, p. 274 The Allies thus withstood two full days of battle and everything Xerxes could throw at them. However, at the end of the second day, they were betrayed by a local resident named Ephialtes who revealed to Xerxes a mountain path that led behind the Allied lines. Xerxes then sent his elite guards, the Immortals on a night march to outflank the Allied. When he was made aware of this maneuver (while the Immortals were still en route), Leonidas dismissed the bulk of the Allied army, remaining to guard the rear with 300 Spartans, 700 Thespians, 400 Thebians and perhaps a few hundred others. On the third day of the battle, the remaining Allies sallied forth from the wall to meet the Persians and slaughter as many as they could.Herodotus VII, 223 Ultimately, however, the Allied rearguard was annihilated, and the pass of Thermopylae opened to the Persians.Herodotus, VII, 225 Achaemenid king killing a Greek hoplite. Circa 500 BC‚Äì475 BC, at the time of Xerxes I. Metropolitan Museum of Art. Simultaneous with the battle at Thermopylae, an Allied naval force of 271 triremes defended the Straits of Artemisium against the Persians.Herodotus, VIII, 2 Directly before Artemisium, the Persian fleet had been caught in a gale off the coast of Magnesia, losing many ships, but could still probably muster over 800 ships at the start of the battle.Holland, pp. 276-281 On the first day (also the first of the Battle of Thermopylae), the Persians detached 200 seaworthy ships, which were sent to sail around the eastern coast of Euboea. These ships were to round Euboea and block the line of retreat for the Allied fleet. Meanwhile, the Allies and the remaining Persians engaged in the late afternoon, the Allies having the better of the engagement and capturing 30 vessels. That evening, another storm occurred, wrecking the majority of the Persian detachment which had been sent around Euboea.Herodotus VIII, 8 On the second day of the battle, news reached the Allies that their lines of retreat were no longer threatened; they therefore resolved to maintain their position. They staged a hit-and-run attack on some Cilician ships, capturing and destroying them.Herodotus VIII, 14 On the third day, however, the Persian fleet attacked the Allies lines in full force. In a day of savage fighting, the Allies held on to their position, but suffered severe lossesHerodotus VIII, 16 (half the Athenian fleet was damagedHerodotus VIII, 18); nevertheless, the Allies inflicted equal losses on the Persian fleet. That evening, the Allies received news of the fate of Leonidas and the Allies at Thermopylae. Since the Allied fleet was badly damaged, and since it no longer needed to defend the flank of Thermopylae, they retreated from Artemisium to the island of Salamis.Herodotus VIII, 21 ==September 480 BC: Destruction of Athens, battle of Salamis== Acropolis of Athens, which was stormed and burned down by the Achaemenid Army of Xerxes. Remains of the Old Temple of Athena on the Acropolis, destroyed by the armies of Xerxes I during the Destruction of Athens. Part of the archaeological remains called Perserschutt, or \\"Persian rubble\\": remnants of the destruction of Athens by the armies of Xerxes. Photographed in 1866, just after excavation. Victory at Thermopylae meant that all Boeotia fell to Xerxes; the two cities that had resisted him, Thespiae and Plataea, were captured and razed. Attica was also left open to invasion, and the remaining population of Athens was thus evacuated, with the aid of the Allied fleet, to Salamis.Herodotus VIII, 41 The Peloponnesian Allies began to prepare a defensive line across the Isthmus of Corinth, building a wall, and demolishing the road from Megara, thereby abandoning Athens to the Persians.Holland, p. 300 Athens fell a first time in September 480 BC. The small number of Athenians who had barricaded themselves on the Acropolis were eventually defeated, and Xerxes then ordered Athens to be torched.Holland, pp. 305-306 The Acropolis was razed and the Older Parthenon as well as the Old Temple of Athena were destroyed. The Persians had now captured most of Greece, but Xerxes had perhaps not expected such defiance from the Greeks; his priority was now to complete the war as quickly as possible;Holland, pp. 327-329 the huge invasion force could not be supplied indefinitely, and probably Xerxes did not wish to be at the fringe of his empire for so long.Holland, pp. 308-309 Thermopylae had shown that a frontal assault against a well defended Greek position had little chance of success; with the Allies now dug in across the isthmus, there was therefore little chance of the Persians conquering the rest of Greece by land. However, if the isthmus's defensive line could be outflanked, the Allies could be defeated.Holland, p. 294 Such an outflanking of the isthmus required the use of the Persian navy, and thus the neutralisation of the Allied navy.Lazenby, pp. 157-161 In summary, if Xerxes could destroy the Allied navy, he would be in a strong position to force a Greek surrender; this seemed the only hope of concluding the campaign in that season. Conversely by avoiding destruction, or as Themistocles hoped, by destroying the Persian fleet, the Greeks could avoid conquest. In the final reckoning, both sides were prepared to stake everything on a naval battle, in the hope of decisively altering the course of the war.Holland, p. 303 300px Thus it was that the Allied fleet remained off the coast of Salamis into September, despite the imminent arrival of the Persians. Even after Athens fell to the advancing Persian army, the Allied fleet still remained off the coast of Salamis, trying to lure the Persian fleet to battle.Holland, p. 319 Partly as a result of subterfuge on the part of Themistocles, the navies finally engaged in the cramped Straits of Salamis.Holland, pp. 310-315 There, the large Persian numbers were an active hindrance, as ships struggled to manoeuvre and became disorganised.Herodotus VIII, 89 Seizing the opportunity, the Greek fleet attacked, and scored a decisive victory, sinking or capturing at least 200 Persian ships, and thus ensuring the Peloponnesus would not be outflanked.Holland, pp. 320-326 According to Herodotus, after this loss Xerxes attempted to build a causeway across the straits to attack Salamis (although Strabo and Ctesias place this attempt before the battle). In any case this project was soon abandoned. With the Persians' naval superiority removed, Xerxes feared that the Greeks might sail to the Hellespont and destroy the pontoon bridges.Herodotus VIII, 97 According to Herodotus, Mardonius volunteered to remain in Greece and complete the conquest with a hand-picked group of troops, while advising Xerxes to retreat to Asia with the bulk of the army.Herodotus VIII, 100 All of the Persian forces abandoned Attica, with Mardonius over-wintering in Boeotia and Thessaly. Some Athenians were thus able to return to their burnt-out city for the winter. They would have to evacuate again in front of a second advance by Mardonius in June 479 BC. ==Autumn/winter 480/479 BCSiege of Potidaea=== According to Herodotus a Persian general known as Artabazus escorted Xerxes to the Hellespont with 60,000 men; as he neared Pallene on the return journey to Thessaly: \\"he thought it right that he should enslave the people of Potidaea, whom he found in revolt.\\".Herodotus VIII, 126 Despite attempts to capture Potidaea by treachery,Herodotus VIII, 128 the Persians were forced to keep up the siege for three months.Herodotus VIII, 129 Then, attempting to use an unusually low tide to attack the town from sea, the Persian army was caught by the returning tide, many drowning and the survivors being attacked by the Potideans in boats. Artabazus was thus forced to lift the siege, and return to Mardonius in Thessaly with the remnants of his men. ===Siege of Olynthus=== While besieging Potidea, Artabazus also decided to besiege Olynthus, which was also in revolt.Herodotus VIII, 127 The town was held by the Bottiaean tribe, who had been driven out of Macedon. Having taken the town, he massacred the defenders, and handed over the town to the Chalcidian people. ==June 479 BC: Plataea and Mycale== Battle of Plataea. Over the winter, there seems to have been some tension between the Allies. In particular, the Athenians, who were not protected by the isthmus, but whose fleet were the key to the security of the Peloponnesus, felt hard done by. They demanded an Allied army march north the following year.Holland, pp. 333-335 When the other Allies failed to commit to this, the Athenian fleet probably refused to join the Allied navy in the spring. The navy, now under the command of the Spartan king Leotychides, thus skulked off Delos, while the remnants of the Persian fleet skulked off Samos, both sides unwilling to risk battle. Similarly, Mardonius remained in Thessaly, knowing an attack on the isthmus was pointless, while the Allies refused to send an army outside the Peloponessus. Mardonius moved to break the stalemate, by offering peace, self-government and territorial expansion to the Athenians (with the aim of thereby removing their fleet from the Allied forces), using Alexander I of Macedon as an intermediary.Holland, pp. 336-338 The Athenians made sure that a Spartan delegation was on hand to hear the offer, but rejected it. Athens was thus evacuated again, and the Persians marched south and re-took possession of it. Mardonius brought even more thorough destruction to the city. According to Herodotus, Mardonius \\"burnt Athens and utterly overthrew or demolished whatever wall or house or temple was left standing\\". Mardonius now repeated his offer of peace to the Athenian refugees on Salamis. Athens, along with Megara and Plataea, sent emissaries to Sparta demanding assistance, and threatening to accept the Persian terms if not.Herodotus IX, 7 The Spartans, who were at that time celebrating the festival of Hyacinthus, delayed making a decision for 10 days.Herodotus IX, 6-9 However, when the Athenian emissaries then delivered an ultimatum to the Spartans, they were amazed to hear that a task force was in fact already marching to meet the Persians.Herodotus IX, 10 The main battle at Plataea. The Greek retreat becomes disorganised, and the Persians cross the Asopus to attack. When Mardonius heard that the Allied army was on the march, he retreated into Boeotia, near Plataea, trying to draw the Allies into open terrain where he could use his cavalry.Holland, p. 339 The Allied army however, under the command of the Spartan regent Pausanias, stayed on high ground above Plataea to protect themselves against such tactics.Holland, pp. 342-349 Mardonius ordered a hit-and-run cavalry attack on the Greek lines,Herodotus IX, 20 but the attack was unsuccessful and the cavalry commander killed.Herodotus IX, 23 The outcome prompted the Allies to move to a position nearer the Persian camp, still on high ground.Herodotus IX, 25 As a result, the Allied lines of communication were exposed. The Persian cavalry began to intercept food deliveries and finally managed to destroy the only spring of water available to the Allies. The Allied position now undermined, Pausanias ordered a night-time retreat towards their original positions. This went awry, leaving the Athenians, and Spartans and Tegeans isolated on separate hills, with the other contingents scattered further away, near Plataea itself. Seeing that he might never have a better opportunity to attack, Mardonius ordered his whole army forward.Herodotus IX, 59Holland, pp. 350-355 However, as at Thermopylae, the Persian infantry proved no match for the heavily armoured Greek hoplites,Herodotus IX, 62 and the Spartans broke through to Mardonius's bodyguard and killed him.Herodotus IX, 63 The Persian force thus dissolved in rout; 40,000 troops managed to escape via the road to Thessaly,Herodotus IX, 66 but the rest fled to the Persian camp where they were trapped and slaughtered by the Allies, thus finalising their victory.Herodotus IX, 65 Achaemenid troops at the Battle of Plataea: Greek allies, Sacae, Indians, Bactrians, Medes and Persians, under General Mardonius. On the afternoon of the Battle of Plataea, Herodotus tells us that rumour of the Allied victory reached the Allied navy, at that time off the coast of Mount Mycale in Ionia.Herodotus IX, 100 Their morale boosted, the Allied marines fought and won a decisive victory at the Battle of Mycale that same day, destroying the remnants of the Persian fleet.Holland, pp. 357-358 As soon as the Peloponnesians had marched north of the isthmus, the Athenian fleet under Xanthippus had joined up with the rest of the Allied fleet. The fleet, now able to match the Persians, had first sailed to Samos, where the Persian fleet was based.Herodotus IX, 96 The Persians, whose ships were in a poor state of repair, had decided not to risk fighting, and instead drew their ships up on the beach under Mycale. An army of 60,000 men had been left there by Xerxes, and the fleet joined with them, building a palisade around the camp to protect the ships. However, Leotychides decided to attack the camp with the Allied fleet's marines. Seeing the small size of the Allied force, the Persians emerged from the camp, but the hoplites again proved superior, and destroyed much of the Persian force. The ships were abandoned to the Allies, who burnt them, crippling Xerxes' sea power, and marking the ascendancy of the Allied fleet. ==Aftermath== The Serpent Column, a monument dedicated by the victorious Allies With the twin victories of Plataea and Mycale, the second Persian invasion of Greece was over. Moreover, the threat of future invasion was abated; although the Greeks remained worried that Xerxes would try again, over time it became apparent that the Persian desire to conquer Greece was much diminished. In many ways Mycale represents the start of a new phase of the conflict, the Greek counterattack.Lazenby, p. 247 After the victory at Mycale, the Allied fleet sailed to the Hellespont to break down the pontoon bridges, but found that this was already done.Herodotus IX, 114 The Peloponnesians sailed home, but the Athenians remained to attack the Chersonesos, still held by the Persians. The Persians in the region, and their allies made for Sestos, the strongest town in the region, which the Athenians then laid siege to; after a protracted siege, it fell to the Athenians. Herodotus ended his Historia after the Siege of Sestos. Over the next 30 years, the Greeks, primarily the Athenian-dominated Delian League, would expel the Persians from Macedon, Thrace, the Aegean islands and Ionia.Holland, pp. 359-363 The Achaemenid maintained a strong presence at the doorstep of Greece, in Thrace, until circa 465 BC. In 477-455 BC, according to Thucydides, the allies campaigned against the city of Eion, at the mouth of the Strymon river.Thucydides I, 98 Eion was one of the Achaemenid garrisons left in Thrace during and after the second Persian invasion, along with Doriskos.Herodotus VII, 107 Herodotus then alludes to several failed attempts, presumably Athenian, to dislodge the Persian governor of Doriskos, Mascames. The Achaemenids finally removed Mascames and their garrison at Doriskos circa 465 BC. Peace with Persia came in 449 BC with the Peace of Callias, finally ending the half-century of warfare. ==Tactical analysis== The Greek style of warfare had been honed over the preceding centuries.Holland, pp. 69-72 It revolved around the hoplite, members of the middle-classes (the zeugites) who could afford the armour necessary to fight in this manner.Holland, p. 217 The hoplite was, by the standards of the time, heavily armoured, with linothorax or a breastplate (originally bronze, but probably by this stage made of organic materials such as linen (possibly linothroax) and leather, greaves, a full helmet, and a large round shield (the aspis). Hoplites were armed with a long spear (the doru), which was evidently significantly longer than Persian spears, and a sword (the xiphos). Hoplites fought in the phalanx formation; the exact details are not completely clear, but it was a close-knit formation, presenting a uniform front of overlapping shields, and spears, to the enemy. Properly assembled, the phalanx was a formidable offensive and defensive weapon;Lazenby, pp. 39-41Holland, p. 74 on occasions when it is recorded to have happened, it took a huge number of light infantry to defeat a relatively small phalanx. It is also possible that the \\"leather armor\\" was actually untanned or partially tanned rawhide rather than fully tanned leather, because modern tests have concluded that plain or treated rawhide is a significantly better material for making armor than leather. https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.529983 The phalanx was vulnerable to being outflanked by cavalry, if caught on the wrong terrain, however.Holland, pp. 187-192 The hoplite's heavy armour and long spears made them excellent troops in hand-to-hand combat and gave them significant protection against ranged attacks by light troops and skirmishers. Even if the shield did not stop a missile, there was a reasonable chance the armour would. Diagram reconstructing the armament of a Greek hoplite The Persian infantry used in the invasion were a heterogeneous group drawn from across the empire. However, according to Herodotus, there was at least a general conformity in the type of armour and style of fighting.Lazenby, pp. 23-29 The troops were, generally speaking, armed with a bow, 'short spear' and sword, carried a wicker shield, and wore at most a leather jerkin.Holland, p. 196 The one exception to this may have been the ethnic Persian troops, who may have worn a corslet of scaled armour. Some of the contingents may have been armed somewhat differently; for instance, the Saka were renowned axemen.Holland, pp. 17-18 The 'elite' contingents of the Persian infantry seem to have been the ethnic Persians, Medians, Cissians and the Saka. The foremost of the infantry were the royal guards, the Immortals, although they were still armed in the aforementioned style.Holland, p. 274-275 Cavalry was provided by the Persians, Bactrians, Medes, Cissians and Saka; most of these probably fought as lightly armed missile cavalry.Lazenby, p. 232 The style of fighting used by the Persians was probably to stand off from an enemy, using their bows (or equivalent) to wear down the enemy before closing in to deliver the coup de grace with spear and sword. Persian soldiers, possibly Immortals, a frieze in Darius's palace at Susa. Silicious glazed bricks, c. 510 BC, Louvre. The Persians had encountered hoplites in battle before at Ephesus, where their cavalry had easily routed the (probably exhausted) Greeks.Holland, pp. 160-161 However, at the battle of Marathon, the Athenian hoplites had shown their superiority over the Persian infantry, albeit in the absence of any cavalry.Holland, pp. 192-197 It is therefore slightly surprising that the Persians did not bring any hoplites from the Greek regions, especially Ionia, under their control in Asia. Equally, Herodotus tells us that the Egyptian marines serving in the navy were well armed, and performed well against the Greek marines; yet no Egyptian contingent served in the army. The Persians may not have completely trusted the Ionians and Egyptians, since both had recently revolted against Persian rule. However, if this is the case, then it must be questioned why there were Greek and Egyptian contingents in the navy. The Allies evidently tried to play on the Persian fears about the reliability of the Ionians in Persian service;Herodotus VIII, 22Herodotus IX, 98 but, as far as we can tell, both the Ionians and Egyptians performed particularly well for the Persian navy. It may therefore simply be that neither the Ionians nor Egyptians were included in the army because they were serving in the fleet -- none of the coastal regions of the Persian empire appear to have sent contingents with the army. In the two major land battles of the invasion, the Allies clearly adjusted their tactics to nullify the Persian advantage in numbers and cavalry, by occupying the pass at Thermopylae, and by staying on high ground at Plataea.Holland, p. 343 At Thermopylae, until the path outflanking the Allied position was revealed, the Persians signally failed to adjust their tactics to the situation, although the position was well chosen to limit the Persian options.Lazenby, p. 138 At Plataea, the harassing of the Allied positions by cavalry was a successful tactic, forcing the precipitous (and nearly disastrous) retreat; however, Mardonius then brought about a general melee between the infantry, which resulted in the Persian defeat. The events at Mycale reveal a similar story; Persian infantry committing themselves to a melee with hoplites, with disastrous results. It has been suggested that there is little evidence of complex tactics in the Greco- Persian wars.Lazenby, p. 258 However, as simple as the Greek tactics were, they played to their strengths; the Persians however, may have seriously underestimated the strength of the hoplite, and their failure to adapt to facing the Allied infantry contributed to the eventual Persian defeat. ==Strategic analysis== The Scythians (Sakas) formed a large portion of the Achaemenid army. Detail of the tomb of Xerxes I at Naqsh-e Rostam, circa 480 BC. At the beginning of the invasion, it is clear that the Persians held most advantages.Lazenby, p. 248-253 Regardless of its actual size, it is clear that the Persians had brought an overwhelming number of troops and ships to Greece.Lazenby, p. 29 The Persians had a unified command system, and everyone was answerable to the king.Lazenby, p. 21 They had a hugely efficient bureaucracy, which allowed them to undertake remarkable feats of planning.Lazenby, pp. 17-18Lazenby, p. 30 The Persian generals had significant experience of warfare over the 80 years in which the Persian empire had been established.Lazenby, p. 31 Furthermore, the Persians excelled in the use of intelligence and diplomacy in warfare, as shown by their (nearly successful) attempts to divide-and-conquer the Greeks.Lazenby, pp. 29-30Holland, pp. 311-313Holland, pp. 344-345 The Greeks, by comparison, were fragmented, with only 30 or so city-states actively opposing the Persian invasion; even those were prone to quarrel with each other.Lazenby, pp. 21-22 They had little experience of large-scale warfare, being largely restricted to small-scale local warfare,Lazenby, p. 33 and their commanders were chosen primarily on the basis of the political and social standing, rather than because of any experience or expertise.Lazenby, pp. 37-38 As Lazenby therefore asks: \\"So why did the Persians fail?\\" The Persian strategy for 480 BC was probably to simply progress through Greece in overwhelming force. The cities in any territory that the army passed through would be forced to submit or risk destruction; and indeed this happened with the Thessalian, Locrian and Phocian cities who initially resisted the Persians but then were forced to submit as the Persians advanced.Herodotus, IX, 17Herodotus VII, 172 Conversely, the Allied strategy was probably to try and stop the Persian advance as far north as possible, and thus prevent the submission of as many potential Allies as possible. Beyond this, the Allies seem to have realised that given the Persians' overwhelming numbers, they had little chance in open battle, and thus they opted to try to defend geographical bottle-necks, where the Persian numbers would count for less. The whole Allied campaign for 480 BC can be seen in this context. Initially they attempted to defend the Tempe pass to prevent the loss of Thessaly. After they realised that they could not defend this position, they chose the next-most northerly position, the Thermopylae/Artemisium axis. The Allied performance at Thermopylae was initially effective; however, the failure to properly guard the path that outflanked Thermopylae undermined their strategy, and led to defeat. At Artemisium the fleet also scored some successes, but withdrew due to the losses they had sustained, and since the defeat of Thermopylae made the position irrelevant.Lazenby, pp. 149-150 Thus far, the Persian strategy had succeeded, while the Allied strategy, though not a disaster, had failed. A Persian soldier of the Achaemenid army. Detail of the tomb of Xerxes I at Naqsh-e Rostam, circa 480 BC. The defence of the Isthmus of Corinth by the Allies changed the nature of the war. The Persians did not attempt to attack the isthmus by land, realising they probably could not breach it.Lazenby, p. 197Holland, p. 310 This essentially reduced the conflict to a naval one. Themistocles now proposed what was in hindsight the strategic masterstroke in the Allied campaign; to lure the Persian fleet to battle in the straits of Salamis.Holland, p. 316-317 However, as successful as this was, there was no need for the Persians to fight at Salamis to win the war; it has been suggested that the Persians were either overconfident, or overeager to finish the campaign.Holland, pp. 307-308 Thus, the Allied victory at Salamis must at least partially be ascribed to a Persian strategic blunder. After Salamis, the Persian strategy changed. Mardonius sought to exploit dissensions between the Allies in order to fracture the alliance.Lazenby, 254-255 In particular, he sought to win over the Athenians, which would leave the Allied fleet unable to oppose Persian landings on the Peloponnesus. Although Herodotus tells us that Mardonius was keen to fight a decisive battle, his actions in the run-up to Plataea are not particularly consistent with this. He seems to have been willing to accept battle on his terms, but he waited either for the Allies to attack, or for the alliance to collapse ignominiously. The Allied strategy for 479 BC was something of a mess; the Peloponnesians only agreed to march north in order to save the alliance, and it appears that the Allied leadership had little idea how to force a battle that they could win. It was the botched attempt to retreat from Plataea that finally delivered the Allies battle on their terms. Mardonius may have been overeager for victory; there was no need to attack the Allies, and by doing so he played to the main Allied tactical strength, combat in the melee. The Allied victory at Plataea can also therefore be seen as partially the result of a Persian mistake. Thus, the Persian failure may be seen partly as a result of two strategic mistakes that handed the Allies tactical advantages, and resulted in decisive defeats for the Persians. The Allied success is often seen as the result of \\"free men fighting for their freedom\\".Green, p. 36 This may have played a part, and certainly the Greeks seem to have interpreted their victory in those terms. One crucial factor in the Allied success was that, having formed an alliance, however fractious, they remained true to it, despite the odds. There appear to have been many occasions when the alliance seemed in doubt, but ultimately it withstood; and while this alone did not defeat the Persians, it meant that even after the occupation of most of Greece, the Allies were not themselves defeated. This is exemplified by the remarkable fact that the citizens of Athens, Thespiae and Plataea chose to carry on fighting from exile rather than submit to the Persians.Lazenby, pp. 259-261 Ultimately, the Allies succeeded because they avoided catastrophic defeats, stuck to their alliance, took advantage of Persian mistakes, and because in the hoplite they possessed an advantage (perhaps their only real advantage at the start of the conflict), which, at Plataea, allowed them to destroy the Persian invasion force.Lazenby, p. 256 ==Significance== Greek hoplite and Persian warrior depicted fighting. Ancient kylix, 5th century BC. The second Persian invasion of Greece was an event of major significance in European history. A large number of historians hold that, had Greece been conquered, the Ancient Greek culture that lies at the basis of Western civilization would have never developed (and by extension Western civilization itself).Hanson, Carnage and Culture: Landmark Battles in the Rise of Western PowerStrauss, pp. 1‚Äì294Holland, pp xvii‚Äìxix While this may be an exaggeration, it is clear that even at the time the Greeks understood that something very significant had happened.Holland, pp xvi Militarily, there was not much in the way of tactical or strategic innovation during the Persian invasion, one commentator suggesting it was something of \\"a soldier's war\\" (i.e., it was the soldiers rather than generals that won the war).Lazenby, pp. 257‚Äì258 Thermopylae is often used as a good example of the use of terrain as a force multiplier,Eikenberry (1996) while Themistocles's ruse before Salamis is a good example of the use of deception in warfare. The major lesson of the invasion, reaffirming the events at the Battle of Marathon, was the superiority of the hoplite in close-quarters fighting over the more-lightly armed Persian infantry.Holland, p. 358‚Äì359 Taking on this lesson, the Persian empire would later, after the Peloponnesian War, start recruiting and relying on Greek mercenaries.Xenophon, Anabasis ==ReferencesBibliographyAncient sources=== *Herodotus, The Histories ** Macan translation of books 7-9 of The Histories (The Perseus Digital Library) (1908) ** Macauley translation of The Histories * Diodorus Siculus, Biblioteca Historica * Ctesias, Persica (from Photius's Epitome) ===Modern sources=== *Holland, Tom (2006).

In 2004, when German organizers were able to secure permits back in Berlin, North American organizers decided to continue their own event and dubbed it the LoveFest. In 2009 the name was changed to LovEvolution to avoid confusion with a similarly named electronic music event in LA. In 2009 the permit for LovEvolution was revoked by officials in San Francisco citing safety concerns. Unable to find a suitable venue after the permits were revoked the event was cancelled in 2010 and moved to Oakland the following year and became a paid event. Since 2011 the parade has not been held and its website states it is looking for a venue.

At the age of ten he became an orphan. His childhood pain of loss, sorrow and pleasure are reflected in his poem ¬´Conversation with mother¬ª (1934). In his youth Mamakaev was a Komsomol member and studied in Moscow at Communist University of the Toilers of the East. The outlook of that period was reflected in its first literary works: ‚ÄúMorning over Argun‚Äù, \\"Swallow\\", \\"Pondar\\" and lyric epic poem ‚ÄúBloody mountains‚Äù (1928). On pages of magazines ¬´Revolution and the mountaineer¬ª, ¬´On lifting¬ª he argued with authorities of that time concerning description of history of the Chechen Republic during the period of the Civil War in the North Caucasus. He underlined in the articles the role of Russian intelligentsia in formation of the Chechen literature and art, value of rapprochement of cultures of Russians and Chechens. Mamakaev's work in the Communist Party, Soviet bodies of Checheno-Ingushetia, in newspapers \\"Groznensky worker\\", \\"the Lenin way\\" was connected with Enlightenment. He organised publishing of the Chechen language political and literary art magazines. Mamakaev was not only a popular writer, but also a recognised authority in Checheno-Ingushetia. He edited books of poetry, literary almanacs, magazines, participated in preparation of the anthology of Chechen- Ingush poetry. In 1967, Mamakaev published a novel about the Chechen abrek Zelimkhan, which \\"aestheticizes violence through the lexicon of transgressive sanctity.\\"1 Mamakaev's role in formation of the modern Chechen literature has earned him the reputation of a major figure in the cultural history of the Chechen Republic. ==See also References == 1Rebecca Ruth Gould, Writers and Rebels: The Literature of Insurgency in the Caucasus (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2016), 79. == Notes == * Rebecca Ruth Gould, \\"Topographies of Anticolonialism: The Ecopoetical Sublime in the Caucasus from Tolstoy to Mamakaev,\\" Comparative Literature Studies, Vol. 50, No. 1, pp. 87‚Äì107, 2013.

She served as a diarist to President Bill Clinton from 1995 - 2001. ==Early life and education== Janis F. Kearney was born September 29, 1953, in Gould, Arkansas to Ethel V. Curry Kearney and Thomas James Kearney; she is the 14th of 19 children. Janis‚Äô father was a sharecropper, and her mother was a homemaker, who spent much of her time, assisting her husband with the family's cotton crops. From the age of seven, Janis spent her summers chopping cotton, and autumns helping the family pick cotton. By the age of nine, she was also helping care for her younger siblings, and cooking for the family. However, every evening she and her siblings learned reading, writing, and arithmetic at home; they always returned to school in the winter at the top of their classes. All except one of the Kearney children graduated from college and most went on to graduate school, law school, or both. Many attended some of the top colleges and universities in the country including Harvard, Yale, Brown, Vanderbilt, and Stanford. After graduating from Gould High School in 1971, Janis attended the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville. She married and had one child during her junior year in college; but she went on to earn a B.A. in journalism in 1976. She continued her education while working, earning thirty hours towards a M.P.A. from the University of Arkansas at Little Rock. ==Professional career== Kearney was hired by the State of Arkansas in 1978, where she spent three years as a program manager for the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act program, and another six years as the director of information for the national headquarters of the Migrant Student Records Transfer System. In 1987, she became the managing editor of the Arkansas State Press newspaper, owned and operated by civil rights activist Daisy Bates. Three months after Janis joined the paper, Bates retired and Kearney bought the company from her. Janis published the weekly newspaper in Arkansas for five years. In 1992, when then governor Bill Clinton decided to run for U.S. President, he hired Kearney who he had met during her years with State Government, from her role as publisher of the Arkansas State Press, and as part of the Arkansas Kearney family; to serve as director of his campaign's Minority Media Outreach effort. Governor Clinton had taught several of her brothers during his stint as a professor of law at the University of Arkansas, and later appointed three members of the family to high-level state jobs. Janis took a sabbatical from her newspaper in 1992, and appointed her sister, Janetta Kearney, to run the newspaper during her absence. The newspaper suspended operation in 1998. ==Clinton Administration== Following the 1993 election, Kearney worked in the Little Rock office of the Clinton presidential transition. After the president's inauguration, she was one of the Arkansans invited to join the President in Washington, D.C. She worked first as a White House media affairs officer and then as director of public communication for the U.S. Small Business Administration. In 1995 Kearney was appointed to serve as the first-ever personal diarist to a President. In her role Kearney kept a daily diary of President Clinton's days, attending meetings, events, and press conferences to create a living history. Her job placed her in the middle of the political scandals that plagued the Clinton administration. In 1997 she was a part of the controversy surrounding Clinton's campaign-fundraising activities, and in 1998 she was forced to testify before a Kenneth Starr grand jury to investigate the Clinton sex scandal. Her diary of the President's days was subpoenaed. No wrongdoing was found. The diary would eventually be passed on to the Clinton Library. ==Journalistic and publishing activities== In 2001, Janis moved to Chicago, but began a two-year Fellowship at the Harvard University W. E. B. Du Bois Institute of African and African American Studies, where she began writing her Clinton biography, Conversations: William Jefferson Clinton-From Hope to Harlem. She continued her research and writing of Conversations as a visiting fellow at DePaul University. In 2003, she was appointed Chancellor's Lecturer for Chicago City Colleges. During that time Janis also wrote a syndicated column, Politics Is Life, which appeared in African-American newspapers throughout the country. Eventually, Conversations was published in 2006, and features, in part, interviews with more than 100 African-American acquaintances and friends of President Clinton about his legacy. Conversations was Kearney's second book. Kearney began working on her first book, Cotton Field of Dreams, in 1977, which focused on her father's life story. After years of shopping her manuscript at writers‚Äô workshops, she began revising the book to personal memoir, which included vignettes about her father and the rest of the family. She revised the book over the next ten years. Kearney established Writing Our World (WOW) Press in 2004, and published \\"Cotton Field of Dreams\\" that same year. In November 2008, Kearney published her first novel, Onece Upon a Time There Was A Girl: A Murder at Mobile Bay. She also published the second installment of her memoir following Cotton Field: Something to Write Home About: Memories of a Presidential Diarist. ==References== Category:American non-fiction writers Category:Living people Category:African-American women writers Category:American women non- fiction writers Category:African-American writers Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Janis F.

With peak winds of 110 mph (175 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 972 mbar (hPa; 28.71 inHg), Florence was the strongest storm of the 1994 Atlantic hurricane season. Florence developed out of an area of low pressure associated with a stalled frontal system located 1,150 mi (1,850 km) east-southeast of Bermuda in late October. The system gradually became better organized and was classified a subtropical depression on November 2. The storm intensified into a subtropical storm shortly thereafter before weakening into a tropical depression on the next day. After gaining tropical characteristics throughout most of the day on November 3, the storm was designated Tropical Depression Eleven. The depression quickly strengthened into Tropical Storm Florence, the sixth named storm of the season. The storm briefly underwent rapid intensification, strengthening into a hurricane, before leveling out as a Category 1 hurricane. Florence was subsequently upgraded to a Category 2 hurricane on November 7\\\\. However, a large extratropical cyclone located to the north caused the hurricane to rapidly accelerate, with forward speeds reaching 58 mph (93 km/h). By the next day, Florence lost its identity, while still producing hurricane-force winds, as it was absorbed by the extratropical cyclone. ==Meteorological history== The origins of Florence can be traced back to an area of low pressure which developed in late October along a stationary front located 1,150 mi (1,850 km) east-southeast of Bermuda. The low gradually detached from the front and began developing convective banding features. The system was not fully tropical as the strongest winds were recorded a couple hundred miles from the center, leading to the system being classified a subtropical cyclone on the morning of November 2. Minor intensification followed shortly after and the subtropical depression was upgraded to a subtropical storm. This was based on ship reports of 40 mph (65 km/h) sustained winds associated with the system. By November 3, the storm became slightly disorganized and was downgraded to a subtropical depression. By the afternoon, the subtropical system began to undergo a transition from a subtropical system to tropical system. Later that day, the storm was classified Tropical Depression Eleven while located 875 mi (1,400 km) east-southeast of Bermuda. The depression was moving towards the northwest at 8 mph (13 km/h) and the same general motion was expected as a large upper- level low situated over the system was forecast to move towards the northeast, leading to Eleven moving around the periphery of the low. The depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Florence the next morning. However, outflow from the storm remained poor as the upper-level low was still interacting with the center of Florence and the storm was still not completely tropical but there was slight improvement. By the afternoon of November 4, Florence completed its transition into a tropical cyclone and deep convection developed, causing the storm to quickly intensity; with winds increasing by 20 mph (30 km/h) in a 6-hour time period. The trend in intensification was forecast to continue and Florence was forecast to become the second hurricane of the season within 12 hours. Late on November 4, Florence was upgraded to a hurricane as a solid area of deep convection developed around the center of circulation. An eye feature also appeared on infrared satellite but was not associated with significant strengthening. Florence slowly intensified as the eye persisted and the structure slightly improved. By the morning of November 6, the eye became less defined and the cloud tops around it warmed. The storm also shifted its forward motion northward as the trough located to the southeast began to move towards the east, moving the steering currents with it. As the low moved further to the east, steering currents in the area of Florence weakened, leading to the storm stalling late on November 6. Space Shuttle Atlantis By the morning of November 7, the eye began to reappear and the storm turned towards the northwest and the forward motion began to rapidly increase. Later that morning, Florence had developed a large, 35 to 40 mi (55 to 65 km/h) wide eye and the forward motion continued to increase. The intensification continued and by the afternoon hours, Florence was upgraded to a Category 2 hurricane with winds of 100 mph (155 km/h). A strong extratropical cyclone located to the north of Florence was causing the storm to move towards the northwest at a rapid pace of 30 mph (48 km/h). Operationally, Florence was reported to have peaked at that intensity, but post-season analysis determined that the storm reached its peak intensity just short of major hurricane--a storm with winds of 111 mph (178 km/h) or higher-- status late on November 7. By the morning of November 8, Florence weakened slightly to Category 1 status. The large system to the north continued to cause Florence to move at 58 mph (93 km/h). Since the storm was very close to a cold front, Florence was expected to rapidly transition into an extratropical cyclone. Later that morning, Florence was absorbed into the extratropical cyclone while still maintaining hurricane-force winds. ==Impact and naming== As Florence remained out over the open waters of the central Atlantic, no effects, damages, or fatalities were reported. No tropical storm watches or warnings were issued, and the storm was never forecast to strike land. ==See also== * Other storms of the same name ==References *The NHC's Preliminary Report (Tropical Cyclone Report) on Hurricane Florence *The NHC's Public Advisory archive on Hurricane Florence *The NHC's Discussion archive on Hurricane Florence Category:1994 Atlantic hurricane season Category:Category 2 Atlantic hurricanes ","title":"Hurricane Florence (1994)"},{"id":"20198681","text":"University Hospital Lewisham (formerly known as Lewisham Hospital) is an acute district general hospital run by Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Trust and serving the London Borough of Lewisham.The Lewisham Healthcare NHS Trust on NHS Choices It is now affiliated with King's College London and forms part of the King's Health Partners academic health science centre. It is situated on Lewisham High Street between Lewisham and Catford. == History Early history=== The site of the current hospital was originally a workhouse, following the bequest of a house on Rushey Green to Lewisham Parish for the relief of the poor in 1612. When the Lewisham workhouse became overcrowded, a new workhouse building was erected in 1817. The Lewisham Poor Law Union was formed in 1836, and the workhouse was enlarged. This improvement included the building of cholera wards behind the workhouse building. A report in The Lancet in 1865 showed that the workhouse was essentially functioning as a hospital at that time: ‚ÄúSick, infirm, and able-bodied ‚Äì so called at least, but we saw none in the entire house ‚Äì were placed in close approximation‚Äù. At that time there were seven ‚Äúsick wards‚Äù, with 72 beds, and four ‚Äúinfection wards‚Äù with 22 beds. Land to the north of the workhouse was used to construct a separate infirmary from 1892, and this was formally opened in 1894.Foundation stone plaque on display inside the Riverside Building main entrance - see image on Commons During the First World War the infirmary became the Lewisham Military Hospital. Most workhouse inmates were relocated, but parts of the workhouse still functioned until 1929. During the Second World War the hospital was hit by a V-1 flying bomb, which destroyed two wards, injured 70 people and killed one nurse. Following the formation of the National Health Service in 1948, the hospital continued to expand with new buildings opened in the 1950s and 1960s. These included the Outpatients Department in 1958, and an extension to the Accident Department in 1964. In 1954 a premature baby unit was opened, and in 1968 this was replaced by a Special Care Baby Unit. In 1968 the Intensive Therapy Unit was also opened ‚Äì this was the first such unit in a district general hospital in England. In 1991 the Sydenham Children's Hospital closed and moved to Lewisham Hospital. In November 1996 the Women's and Children's Wing was opened by Princess Alexandra. Lewisham Hospital NHS Trust was established in April 1993 when it formally separated from Guy's Hospital. In 1997 Hither Green Hospital closed, and the Elderly Care service was transferred to Lewisham Hospital. ===Redevelopment=== Further improvements culminated in the construction of the Riverside Building which was procured under a Private Finance Initiative contract in 2004. The works were designed by RTKL Associates and completed by Carillion at a cost of ¬£58 million in December 2006. The building was officially opened by Archbishop Desmond Tutu in May 2007. It reflects current thinking about patient care, replacing Nightingale wards with multiple four- bedded bays. The design also reflects contemporary environmental concerns and was the first major NHS building to generate a proportion of its own power using photovoltaic panels installed on the roof. In 2012, architects AWW worked with the hospital to re-plan five wards and medical facilities whilst maintaining the Emergency Department. The expanded facilities improve efficiency with the addition of a new Children's Emergency Department, Urgent Care Centre and new emergency x-ray facilities. ===Proposed Accident and Emergency closure=== In July 2012, South London Healthcare NHS Trust was put into financial administration. A government report in 2012 recommended that three SLHT hospitals should be taken over by nearby NHS trusts and that the University Hospital Lewisham Accident and Emergency unit should close, with A&E; patients instead going to the SLHT-run Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Woolwich to make that hospital more viable. There was a strong campaign in Lewisham against the proposed closure, including a march on 24 November 2012 and a successful legal challenge. In July 2013, the High Court ruled that the closure of Lewisham A&E; could not go ahead. In October 2013, the Court of Appeal ruled that Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt did not have power to implement cuts at Lewisham Hospital. The director of the Save Lewisham Hospital campaign described this as \\"a complete victory\\". ==Facilities== The hospital offers a wide range of services including adult and children's Emergency departments and specialist services including neonatology, paediatric surgery, cystic fibrosis treatment, haemophilia treatment and Ear Nose and Throat (ENT) services. The hospital provides teaching and training for medical staff and gained university status in 1997. The Ladywell Unit on the premises is operated by the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust. == See also == * Healthcare in London * List of hospitals in England * King's Health Partners == References  External links == * Trust website * University Hospital Lewisham on the NHS website * Care Quality Commission inspection reports Category:NHS hospitals in London Category:Hospitals established in 1894 Category:Hospital buildings completed in 1958 Category:Hospital buildings completed in 1964 Category:Teaching hospitals in England Category:Buildings and structures in the London Borough of Lewisham Category:Health in the London Borough of Lewisham Category:Poor law infirmaries ","title":"University Hospital Lewisham"},{"id":"20198683","text":"Central Lakes College is a two-year community and technical college in the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities System with campuses in Brainerd and Staples.

It has roughly 1.5 times the Sun's mass and 4.9 times its luminosity. It is part of a system that also contains a debris disk and at least four massive planets. Those planets, along with Fomalhaut b, were the first exoplanets whose orbital motion was confirmed by direct imaging. The star is a Gamma Doradus variable: its luminosity changes because of non-radial pulsations of its surface. The star is also classified as a Lambda Bo√∂tis star, which means its surface layers are depleted in iron peak elements. It is the only known star which is simultaneously a Gamma Doradus variable, a Lambda Bo√∂tis type, and a Vega-like star (a star with excess infrared emission caused by a circumstellar disk). == Location== HR 8799 is a star that is visible to the naked eye. It has a 5.96 magnitude and it is located inside the western edge of the great square of Pegasus almost exactly halfway between Scheat and Markab. The star's name of HR 8799 is the designation that it has as its identifier in the Bright Star Catalogue. Location of HR 8799 ==Stellar properties== The star HR 8799 is a member of the Lambda Bo√∂tis (Œª Boo) class, a group of peculiar stars with an unusual lack of metals‚Äîelements heavier than hydrogen and helium‚Äîin their upper atmosphere. Because of this special status, stars like HR 8799 have a very complex spectral type. The luminosity profile of the Balmer lines in the star's spectrum, as well as the star's effective temperature, best match the typical properties of an F0 V star. However, the strength of the calcium II K absorption line and the other metallic lines are more like those of an A5 V star. The star's spectral type is therefore written as . Age determination of this star shows some variation based on the method used. Statistically, for stars hosting a debris disk, the luminosity of this star suggests an age of about 20‚Äì150 million years. Comparison with stars having similar motion through space gives an age in the range 30‚Äì160 million years. Given the star's position on the Hertzsprung‚ÄìRussell diagram of luminosity versus temperature, it has an estimated age in the range of 30‚Äì1,128 million years. Œª Bo√∂tis stars like this are generally young, with a mean age of a billion years. More accurately, asteroseismology also suggests an age of approximately a billion years. However, this is disputed because it would make the planets become brown dwarfs to fit into the cooling models. Brown dwarfs would not be stable in such a configuration. The best accepted value for an age of HR 8799 is 30 million years, consistent with being a member of the Columba association co- moving group of stars. Earlier analysis of the star's spectrum reveals that it has a slight overabundance of carbon and oxygen compared to the Sun (by approximately 30% and 10% respectively). While some Lambda Bo√∂tis stars have sulfur abundances similar to that of the Sun, this is not the case for HR 8799; the sulfur abundance is only around 35% of the solar level. The star is also poor in elements heavier than sodium: for example, the iron abundance is only 28% of the solar iron abundance. Asteroseismic observations of other pulsating Lambda Bo√∂tis stars suggest that the peculiar abundance patterns of these stars are confined to the surface only: the bulk composition is likely more normal. This may indicate that the observed element abundances are the result of the accretion of metal-poor gas from the environment around the star. In 2020, spectral analysis utilizing multiple data sources have detected an inconsistency in prior data and concluded the star carbon and oxygen abundances are the same or slightly higher than solar. The iron abundance was updated to 30% of solar value. Astroseismic analysis using spectroscopic data indicates that the rotational inclination of the star is constrained to be greater than or approximately equal to 40¬∞. This contrasts with the planets' orbital inclinations, which are in roughly the same plane at an angle of about . Hence, there may be an unexplained misalignment between the rotation of the star and the orbits of its planets. Observation of this star with the Chandra X-ray Observatory indicates that it has a weak level of magnetic activity, but the X-ray activity is much higher than that of an A-type star like Altair. This suggests that the internal structure of the star more closely resembles that of an F0 star. The temperature of the stellar corona is about 3.0 million K. ==Planetary system== On 13 November 2008, Christian Marois of the National Research Council of Canada's Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics and his team announced they had directly observed three planets orbiting the star with the Keck and Gemini telescopes in Hawaii, in both cases employing adaptive optics to make observations in the infrared.The planets are young and therefore they are still hot and bright in the near-infrared part of the spectrum . A precovery observation of the outer 3 planets was later found in infrared images obtained in 1998 by the Hubble Space Telescope's NICMOS instrument, after a newly developed image-processing technique was applied. Further observations in 2009‚Äì2010 revealed the fourth giant planet orbiting inside the first three planets at a projected separation just less than 15 AU which has now also been confirmed in multiple studies. The outer planet orbits inside a dusty disk like the Solar Kuiper belt. It is one of the most massive disks known around any star within 300 light years of Earth, and there is room in the inner system for terrestrial planets. There is an additional debris disk just inside the orbit of the innermost planet. The orbital radii of planets e, d, c and b are 2 to 3 times those of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, respectively. Because of the inverse square law relating radiation intensity to distance from the source, comparable radiation intensities are present at distances \\\\scriptstyle\\\\sqrt{4.9} = 2.2 times farther from HR 8799 than from the Sun, meaning that corresponding planets in the solar and HR 8799 systems receive similar amounts of stellar radiation. These objects are near the upper mass limit for classification as planets; if they exceeded 13 Jupiter masses, they would be capable of deuterium fusion in their interiors and thus qualify as brown dwarfs under the definition of these terms used by the IAU's Working Group on Extrasolar Planets. If the mass estimates are correct, the HR 8799 system is the first multiple-planet extrasolar system to be directly imaged. The orbital motion of the planets is in an anticlockwise direction and was confirmed via multiple observations dating back to 1998. The system is more likely to be stable if the planets \\"e\\", \\"d\\" and \\"c\\" are in a 4:2:1 resonance, which would imply that the orbit of the planet d has an eccentricity exceeding 0.04 in order to match the observational constraints. Planetary systems with the best-fit masses from evolutionary models would be stable if the outer three planets are in a 1:2:4 orbital resonance (similar to the Laplace resonance between Jupiter's inner three Galilean satellites: Io, Europa and Ganymede as well as three of the planets in the Gliese 876 system). However, it is disputed if planet b is in resonance with the other 3 planets. According to dynamical simulations, the HR 8799 planetary system may be even an extrasolar system with multiple resonance 1:2:4:8. The 4 planets are still glowing red hot due to their young age and are larger than Jupiter and over time they will cool and shrink to the size of 0.8 to 1.0 Jupiter radii. The broadband photometry of planets b, c and d has shown that there may be significant clouds in their atmospheres, while the infrared spectroscopy of planets b and c pointed to non-equilibrium / chemistry. Near-infrared observations with the Project 1640 integral field spectrograph on the Palomar Observatory have shown that compositions between the four planets vary significantly. This is a surprise since the planets presumably formed in the same way from the same disk and have similar luminosities. ===Planet spectra=== ESO's Very Large Telescope. A number of studies have used the spectra of HR 8799's planets to determine their chemical compositions and constrain their formation scenarios. The first spectroscopic study of planet b (performed at near-infrared wavelengths) detected strong water absorption, which indicates a hydrogen-rich atmosphere. Weak methane and carbon monoxide absorption in this planet's atmosphere was also detected, indicating efficient vertical mixing of the atmosphere and a disequilibrium / ratio at the photosphere. Compared to models of planetary atmospheres, this first spectrum of planet b is best matched by a model of enhanced metallicity (about 10 times the metallicity of the Sun), which may support the notion that this planet formed through core-accretion. The first simultaneous spectra of all four known planets in the HR 8799 system were obtained in 2012 using the Project 1640 instrument at Palomar Observatory. The near-infrared spectra from this instrument confirmed the red colors of all four planets and are best matched by models of planetary atmospheres that include clouds. Though these spectra do not directly correspond to any known astrophysical objects, some of the planet spectra demonstrate similarities with L- and T-type brown dwarfs and the night-side spectrum of Saturn. The implications of the simultaneous spectra of all four planets obtained with Project 1640 are summarized as follows: Planet b contains ammonia and/or acetylene as well as carbon dioxide, but has little methane; Planet c contains ammonia, perhaps some acetylene but neither carbon dioxide nor substantial methane; Planet d contains acetylene, methane, and carbon dioxide but ammonia is not definitively detected; Planet e contains methane and acetylene but no ammonia or carbon dioxide. The spectrum of planet e is similar to a reddened spectrum of Saturn. Moderate-resolution near-infrared spectroscopy, obtained with the Keck telescope, definitively detected carbon monoxide and water absorption lines in the atmosphere of planet c. The carbon-to-oxygen ratio, which is thought to be a good indicator of the formation history for giant planets, for planet c was measured to be slightly greater than that of the host star HR 8799. The enhanced carbon-to- oxygen ratio and depleted levels of C and O in planet c favor a history in which the planet formed through core accretion. However, it is important to note that conclusions about the formation history of a planet based solely on its composition may be inaccurate if the planet has undergone significant migration, chemical evolution, or core dredging. Later, in November 2018, researchers confirmed the existence of water and the absence of methane in the atmosphere of using high-resolution spectroscopy and near-infrared adaptive optics (NIRSPAO) at the Keck Observatory. The red colors of the planets may be explained by the presence of iron and silicate atmospheric clouds, while their low surface gravities might explain the strong disequilibrium concentrations of carbon monoxide and the lack of strong methane absorption. ===Debris disk=== Spitzer infrared image of HR 8799's debris disk, January 2009. The small dot in the centre is the size of Pluto's orbit. In January 2009 the Spitzer Space Telescope obtained images of the debris disk around HR 8799. Three components of the debris disk were distinguished: # Warm dust (T ~ 150 K) orbiting within the innermost planet (e). The inner and outer edges of this belt are close to 4:1 and 2:1 resonances with the planet. # A broad zone of cold dust (T ~ 45 K) with a sharp inner edge orbiting just outside the outermost planet (b). The inner edge of this belt is approximately in 3:2 resonance with said planet, similar to Neptune and the Kuiper belt. # A dramatic halo of small grains originating in the cold dust component. The halo is unusual and implies a high level of dynamic activity which is likely due to gravitational stirring by the massive planets. The Spitzer team says that collisions are likely occurring among bodies similar to those in the Kuiper Belt and that the three large planets may not yet have settled into their final, stable orbits. In the photo, the bright, yellow-white portions of the dust cloud come from the outer cold disk. The huge extended dust halo, seen in orange-red, has a diameter of ‚âà 2,000 AU. The diameter of Pluto's orbit (‚âà 80 AU) is shown for reference as a dot in the centre. This disk is so thick that it threatens the young system's stability. ===Vortex Coronagraph: Testbed for high-contrast imaging technology=== Direct image of exoplanets around the star HR 8799 using a vortex coronagraph on a 1.5 m portion of the Hale Telescope Up until the year 2010, telescopes could only directly image exoplanets under exceptional circumstances. Specifically, it is easier to obtain images when the planet is especially large (considerably larger than Jupiter), widely separated from its parent star, and hot so that it emits intense infrared radiation. However, in 2010 a team from NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory demonstrated that a vortex coronagraph could enable small telescopes to directly image planets. They did this by imaging the previously imaged HR 8799 planets using just a 1.5 m portion of the Hale Telescope. ===NICMOS images=== In 2009, an old NICMOS image was processed to show a predicted exoplanet around HR 8799. In 2011, three further exoplanets were rendered viewable in a NICMOS image taken in 1998, using advanced data processing. The image allows the planets' orbits to be better characterised, since they take many decades to orbit their host star. ===Search for radio emissions=== Starting in 2010, astronomers searched for radio emissions from the exoplanets orbiting HR 8799 using the radio telescope at Arecibo Observatory. Despite the large masses, warm temperatures, and brown dwarf-like luminosities, they failed to detect any emissions at 5 GHz down to a flux density detection threshold of 1.04 mJy. ==See also== * List of exoplanets * Direct imaging of extrasolar planets ==NotesReferences Category:A-type main-sequence stars Category:Gamma Doradus variables Category:Pegasus (constellation) 218396 114189 8799 Pegasi, V342 Category:Planetary systems with four confirmed planets Category:Lambda Bo√∂tis stars Category:Circumstellar disks Category:Durchmusterung objects ","title":"HR 8799"},{"id":"20198738","text":"Alexandria Technical and Community College is a public community college in Alexandria, Minnesota.

It stands separate from wave function theory as being formulated in terms of the electronic density alone and as such is viewed as a precursor to modern density functional theory. The Thomas‚ÄìFermi model is correct only in the limit of an infinite nuclear charge. Using the approximation for realistic systems yields poor quantitative predictions, even failing to reproduce some general features of the density such as shell structure in atoms and Friedel oscillations in solids. It has, however, found modern applications in many fields through the ability to extract qualitative trends analytically and with the ease at which the model can be solved. The kinetic energy expression of Thomas‚ÄìFermi theory is also used as a component in more sophisticated density approximation to the kinetic energy within modern orbital-free density functional theory. Working independently, Thomas and Fermi used this statistical model in 1927 to approximate the distribution of electrons in an atom. Although electrons are distributed nonuniformly in an atom, an approximation was made that the electrons are distributed uniformly in each small volume element ŒîV (i.e. locally) but the electron density n(\\\\mathbf{r}) can still vary from one small volume element to the next. == Kinetic energy == For a small volume element ŒîV, and for the atom in its ground state, we can fill out a spherical momentum space volume VF up to the Fermi momentum pF , and thus,March 1992, p.24 :V_{\\\\rm F} = \\\\frac{4}{3}\\\\pi p_{\\\\rm F}^3(\\\\mathbf{r}) where \\\\mathbf{r} is the position vector of a point in ŒîV. The corresponding phase space volume is :\\\\Delta V_{\\\\rm ph} = V_{\\\\rm F} \\\\ \\\\Delta V = \\\\frac{4}{3}\\\\pi p_{\\\\rm F}^3(\\\\mathbf{r}) \\\\ \\\\Delta V . The electrons in ŒîVph are distributed uniformly with two electrons per h3 of this phase space volume, where h is Planck's constant.Parr and Yang 1989, p.47 Then the number of electrons in ŒîVph is :\\\\Delta N_{\\\\rm ph} = \\\\frac{2}{h^3} \\\\ \\\\Delta V_{\\\\rm ph} = \\\\frac{8\\\\pi}{3h^3}p_{\\\\rm F}^3(\\\\mathbf{r}) \\\\ \\\\Delta V . The number of electrons in ŒîV is :\\\\Delta N = n(\\\\mathbf{r}) \\\\ \\\\Delta V where n(\\\\mathbf{r}) is the electron number density. Equating the number of electrons in ŒîV to that in ŒîVph gives, :n(\\\\mathbf{r})=\\\\frac{8\\\\pi}{3h^3}p_{\\\\rm F}^3(\\\\mathbf{r}) . The fraction of electrons at \\\\mathbf{r} that have momentum between p and p+dp is, :\\\\begin{align} F_\\\\mathbf{r} (p) dp & = \\\\frac{4 \\\\pi p^2 dp} {\\\\frac{4}{3} \\\\pi p_{\\\\mathrm F}^3(\\\\mathbf{r})} \\\\qquad \\\\qquad p \\\\le p_{\\\\rm F}(\\\\mathbf{r}) \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = 0 \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\quad \\\\text{otherwise} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} Using the classical expression for the kinetic energy of an electron with mass me, the kinetic energy per unit volume at \\\\mathbf{r} for the electrons of the atom is, :\\\\begin{align} t(\\\\mathbf{r}) & = \\\\int \\\\frac{p^2}{2m_e} \\\\ n(\\\\mathbf{r}) \\\\ F_\\\\mathbf{r} (p) \\\\ dp \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = n(\\\\mathbf{r}) \\\\int_{0}^{p_f(\\\\mathbf{r})} \\\\frac{p^2}{2m_e} \\\\ \\\\ \\\\frac{4 \\\\pi p^2 } {\\\\frac{4}{3} \\\\pi p_{\\\\rm F}^3(\\\\mathbf{r})} \\\\ dp \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = C_{\\\\rm kin} \\\\ [n(\\\\mathbf{r})]^{5/3} \\\\end{align} where a previous expression relating n(\\\\mathbf{r}) to p_{\\\\rm F}(\\\\mathbf{r}) has been used and, :C_{\\\\rm kin}=\\\\frac{3h^2}{40m_e}\\\\left(\\\\frac{3}{\\\\pi}\\\\right)^{\\\\frac{2}{3}}. Integrating the kinetic energy per unit volume t(\\\\vec{r}) over all space, results in the total kinetic energy of the electrons,March 1983, p. 5, Eq. 11 :T=C_{\\\\rm kin}\\\\int [n(\\\\mathbf{r})]^{5/3}\\\\ d^3r \\\\ . This result shows that the total kinetic energy of the electrons can be expressed in terms of only the spatially varying electron density n(\\\\mathbf{r}) , according to the Thomas‚ÄìFermi model. As such, they were able to calculate the energy of an atom using this expression for the kinetic energy combined with the classical expressions for the nuclear-electron and electron-electron interactions (which can both also be represented in terms of the electron density). == Potential energies == The potential energy of an atom's electrons, due to the electric attraction of the positively charged nucleus is, :U_{eN} = \\\\int n(\\\\mathbf{r}) \\\\ V_N(\\\\mathbf{r}) \\\\ d^3r \\\\, where V_N(\\\\mathbf{r}) \\\\, is the potential energy of an electron at \\\\mathbf{r} \\\\, that is due to the electric field of the nucleus. For the case of a nucleus centered at \\\\mathbf{r}=0 with charge Ze, where Z is a positive integer and e is the elementary charge, :V_N(\\\\mathbf{r}) = \\\\frac{-Ze^2}{r} . The potential energy of the electrons due to their mutual electric repulsion is, :U_{ee} = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\ e^2 \\\\int \\\\frac{n(\\\\mathbf{r}) \\\\ n(\\\\mathbf{r} \\\\, ')} {\\\\left\\\\vert \\\\mathbf{r} - \\\\mathbf{r} \\\\, ' \\\\right\\\\vert } \\\\ d^3r \\\\ d^3r' . == Total energy == The total energy of the electrons is the sum of their kinetic and potential energies,March 1983, p. 6, Eq. 15 : \\\\begin{align} E & = T \\\\ + \\\\ U_{eN} \\\\ + \\\\ U_{ee} \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = C_{\\\\rm kin}\\\\int [n(\\\\mathbf{r})]^{5/3}\\\\ d^3r \\\\ + \\\\int n(\\\\mathbf{r}) \\\\ V_N(\\\\mathbf{r}) \\\\ d^3r \\\\ + \\\\ \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\ e^2 \\\\int \\\\frac{n(\\\\mathbf{r}) \\\\ n(\\\\mathbf{r} \\\\, ')} {\\\\left\\\\vert \\\\mathbf{r} - \\\\mathbf{r} \\\\, ' \\\\right\\\\vert } \\\\ d^3r \\\\ d^3r' \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} ==The Thomas‚ÄìFermi equation== In order to minimize the energy E while keeping the number of electrons constant, we add a Lagrange multiplier term of the form :-\\\\mu\\\\left(-N + \\\\int n(\\\\mathbf{r})\\\\, d^3r\\\\right), to E. Letting the variation with respect to n vanish then gives the equation : \\\\mu=\\\\frac{5}{3} C_{\\\\rm kin} \\\\, n(\\\\mathbf{r})^{2/3} + V_N(\\\\mathbf{r}) + e^2 \\\\int \\\\frac{n(\\\\mathbf{r}\\\\,')}{\\\\left\\\\vert \\\\mathbf{r}-\\\\mathbf{r}\\\\,'\\\\right\\\\vert} d^3r', which must hold wherever n(\\\\mathbf{r}) is nonzero.March 1983, p. 6, Eq. 18A Brief Review of Thomas-Fermi Theory, Elliott H. Lieb, http://physics.nyu.edu/LarrySpruch/Lieb.pdf, (2.2) If we define the total potential V(\\\\mathbf{r}) by : V(\\\\mathbf{r})=V_N(\\\\mathbf{r}) + e^2 \\\\int \\\\frac{n(\\\\mathbf{r}\\\\,')}{\\\\left\\\\vert \\\\mathbf{r}-\\\\mathbf{r}\\\\,'\\\\right\\\\vert} d^3r', thenMarch 1983, p. 7, Eq. 20 : \\\\begin{align} n(\\\\mathbf{r})& =\\\\left(\\\\frac{5}{3} C_{\\\\rm kin}\\\\right)^{-3/2} (\\\\mu - V(\\\\mathbf{r}))^{3/2},\\\\ {\\\\rm if} \\\\qquad \\\\mu\\\\ge V(\\\\mathbf{r})\\\\\\\\\\\\ & = 0, \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\ {\\\\rm otherwise.} \\\\end{align} If the nucleus is assumed to be a point with charge Ze at the origin, then n(\\\\mathbf{r}) and V(\\\\mathbf{r}) will both be functions only of the radius r=\\\\left\\\\vert\\\\mathbf{r}\\\\right\\\\vert, and we can define œÜ(r) by : \\\\mu-V(r)=\\\\frac{Ze^2}{r} \\\\phi\\\\left(\\\\frac{r}{b}\\\\right), \\\\qquad b = \\\\frac{1}{4} \\\\left(\\\\frac{9 \\\\pi^2}{2Z}\\\\right)^{1/3} a_0, where a0 is the Bohr radius.March 1983, p. 8, Eq. 22, 23 From using the above equations together with Gauss's law, œÜ(r) can be seen to satisfy the Thomas‚ÄìFermi equationMarch 1983, p. 8 : \\\\frac{d^2\\\\phi}{dr^2} = \\\\frac{\\\\phi^{3/2}}{\\\\sqrt{r}}, \\\\qquad \\\\phi(0)=1. For chemical potential Œº = 0, this is a model of a neutral atom, with an infinite charge cloud where n(\\\\mathbf{r}) is everywhere nonzero and the overall charge is zero, while for Œº < 0, it is a model of a positive ion, with a finite charge cloud and positive overall charge. The edge of the cloud is where œÜ(r)=0.March 1983, pp. 9-12. For Œº > 0, it can be interpreted as a model of a compressed atom, so that negative charge is squeezed into a smaller space. In this case the atom ends at the radius r where dœÜ/dr = œÜ/r.March 1983, p. 10, Figure 1.p. 1562, Feynman, Metropolis, and Teller 1949. == Inaccuracies and improvements == Although this was an important first step, the Thomas‚ÄìFermi equation's accuracy is limited because the resulting expression for the kinetic energy is only approximate, and because the method does not attempt to represent the exchange energy of an atom as a conclusion of the Pauli exclusion principle. A term for the exchange energy was added by Dirac in 1928. However, the Thomas‚ÄìFermi‚ÄìDirac theory remained rather inaccurate for most applications. The largest source of error was in the representation of the kinetic energy, followed by the errors in the exchange energy, and due to the complete neglect of electron correlation. In 1962, Edward Teller showed that Thomas‚ÄìFermi theory cannot describe molecular bonding ‚Äì the energy of any molecule calculated with TF theory is higher than the sum of the energies of the constituent atoms. More generally, the total energy of a molecule decreases when the bond lengths are uniformly increased.Parr and Yang 1989, pp.114‚Äì115 This can be overcome by improving the expression for the kinetic energy.Parr and Yang 1989, p.127 One notable historical improvement to the Thomas‚ÄìFermi kinetic energy is the Weizs√§cker (1935) correction, :T_{\\\\rm W}=\\\\frac{1}{8}\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{m}\\\\int\\\\frac{ abla n(\\\\mathbf{r})^2}{n(\\\\mathbf{r})}d^3r which is the other notable building block of orbital-free density functional theory. The problem with the inaccurate modelling of the kinetic energy in the Thomas‚ÄìFermi model, as well as other orbital-free density functionals, is circumvented in Kohn‚ÄìSham density functional theory with a fictitious system of non-interacting electrons whose kinetic energy expression is known. ==See also== * Thomas‚ÄìFermi screening * Thomas‚ÄìFermi approximation for the degeneracy of states ==FootnotesReferences== # # # # R.

Norton had contested every Isle of Man TT race from the inaugural 1907 event through into the 1970s, a feat unrivalled by any other manufacturer, and the development and honing of the Manx racing motorcycle was another step in this racing achievement. New Manx Nortons, built to various specifications are still available to buy new, from various suppliers around the world. These suit different categories and definitions of Classic Motorcycle Racing and Historic Motorcycle Racing in different countries around the world. Norton's first use of the name 'Manx' was applied to the 'Manx Grand Prix' model available from 1936-1940, a special racing version of their 'International' roadster, with telescopic forks and a plunger rear suspension, magnesium for the crankcases and cambox, and no provision for lighting. Just after WW2, the 'Grand Prix' was dropped, and Norton named their 1947 racing model the 'Manx'. It was a lightly redesigned prewar racing Norton International, an overhead cam single-cylinder machine available as a 350cc or 500cc. The Norton factory race bikes under team manager Joe Craig were experimental models, and a version was available for sale from the factory in Bracebridge Street - to selected customers. Fitted with the McCandless brothers' Featherbed frame for 1950, the Manx gained a new lease of racing life as a racing machine, the new frame giving the fine steering necessary for high speed navigation of some very fast racing circuits of the time. The last Bracebridge Street (the original home of Norton) Manx Nortons were sold in 1963. Even though Norton had pulled out of International Grand Prix racing in 1954, the Manx had become the backbone of privateer racing. The Classic Motorcycle Racing movement from the 1970s onwards has seen relatively large numbers of Manxs return to the track, and a flourishing supply of parts and services has appeared all around the world to nourish this demand. == Development == 1937 Norton International - the Manx name didn't appear until after WW2 The Norton Manx was developed to win the Isle of Man TT from single overhead cam international racers by Norton racing team engineer Joe Craig. The double overhead cam configuration was developed in 1937 and after many problems perfected one year later. The Manx was delayed by the outbreak of World War II but reemerged for the 1946 Manx Grand Prix. The motorcycle was upgraded with new telescopic forks and in 1948 gained twin leading shoe brakes. In 1950 the innovative Featherbed frame was developed, giving the Manx a significant competitive advantage through a low centre of gravity and short wheelbase that was perfectly suited the challenging island TT course. The all-welded, tubular featherbed frame was light and trim, without the usual forgings that added unnecessary weight. In 1950, the featherbed Manx recorded a double hat-trick of podium positions at the TT. The Manx engine was redesigned in 1953 with a much shorter stroke of to improve the rev range. The major 1954 upgrade to the Manx was to have been an engine with the cylinder mounted horizontally to give a much lower centre of gravity - along the lines of the Moto Guzzi and Benelli racers. However, a decline in sales in the mid 1950s prompted a number of manufacturers to withdraw from GP racing in 1954, and Nortons did likewise. The Norton F Type Manx, as it was to have been, still exists, and restored is displayed in the Sammy Millers Museum Collection. With Nortons withdrawal from racing, Joe Craig retired after more than 25 years of coaxing ever more power and reliability from his single cylinder Cammy racers. The bike had several wins at the Bol d'Or from 1958 to 1971. Norton Manx ==Les Archer Norton Manx MX== British racer Les Archer, Jr. worked with frame specialist Ron Hankins and engine tuner Ray Petty to develop a Norton Manx for motocross competition. The double-overhead-cam, short-stroke Norton Manx road racing engine was fitted into a Hankins frame and finished with an aluminium tank and titanium axles. His earlier Manx MX was successful, winning the 1956 F.I.M. 500 cc European Motocross Championship, but even the later updated 1962 machine was not able to compete with the emerging two- stroke bikes of the middle 1960s. ==Car racing== Manx Nortons also played a significant role in the development of post war car racing. At the end of 1950, the English national 500 cc regulations were adopted as the new Formula 3. The JAP Speedway engine had dominated the category initially but the Manx was capable of producing significantly more power and became the engine of choice. Many complete motorcycles were bought in order to strip the engine for 500 cc car racing, as Norton would not sell separate engines. Manx rolling chassis were frequently sold on and paired with Triumph 500 cc twin engines to create Triton cafe racers. Norton Manx Engine in a Cooper race car ==Endings and beginnings== 1962 was the last full year for the production Norton Manx. In July AMC announced the transfer of production from Bracebridge Street to Woolwich in London. Forty two Manx Nortons were produced between November 1962 and January 1963. In 1966 Colin Seeley purchased what remained of the spares and tools, which he eventually sold on to John Tickle in 1969. When Godfrey Nash rode a Norton Manx to victory at the 1969 Yugoslavian Grand Prix at the Opatija Circuit, it would mark the last time that a 500cc Grand Prix race was won on a single-cylinder machine. John Tickle took over the Manx name when Norton ceased production and acquired a large quantity of spare parts. He also manufactured complete racers, called the Manx T5 (500) and T3 (350). Both used the short-stroke Manx engines in a frame designed by Tickle but he could not compete against the Japanese racers and sold his stock and the rights in the late 1970s to Unity Equipe, a retail spares business in Rochdale, UK. Bernie Allen of Wiltshire obtained the rights to manufacture the Manx in 1989 and manufacture a limited number of machines in 1992 and 1993 under the name Allen Norton. The manufacturing rights then passed in 1994 to Andy Molnar, an engineer based in Preston, UK who firstly produced parts faithful to the original 1961 drawings, followed by engines then complete machines named Molnar Manx. A road-version with alternator and 'softer' engine spec is also available in conjunction with ex-racer Steve Tonkin, called Tonkin Tornado with a 2013 base-price of ¬£34,000 (GBP). ==References External links == * * * Manx Category:Racing motorcycles Category:Grand Prix motorcycles ","title":"Norton Manx"},{"id":"20198891","text":"Bulgarian Base area featuring the chapel's old and new premises The chapel's new building on Pesyakov Hill in 2012 St. Ivan Rilski Chapel's altar The old St. Ivan Rilski Chapel, with Balkan Snowfield and Hemus Peak, Bowles Ridge and Burdick Ridge in the background The interior of the old chapel in 2011 The St. Ivan Rilski Chapel (St. John of Rila Chapel, ) at the Bulgarian base St. Kliment Ohridski on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands is the first Eastern Orthodox edifice in Antarctica, the southernmost Eastern Orthodox building of worship in the world (cf.

It was ranked as the 262nd largest company in the world by revenue in Fortune Global 500 (2008). It is number 26 in petroleum refining. Idemitsu Kosan is listed in the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange and, since absorbing Showa Shell Sekiyu in 2019, is a constituent of the Nikkei 225 index; however, it is not a constituent of the TOPIX 100 index (instead, it is a constituent of the TOPIX Mid400 index). ==History Early 20th century === Saz≈ç Idemitsu founded in 1911, selling lubricant oil for Nippon Oil in Moji, northern Kyushu. He expanded to selling fuel oil for fishing boats in Shimonoseki.International Directory of Company Histories, Vol. 49. St. James Press, 2003 as quoted on and Idemitsu K≈çsan Co., Ltd. (2008). In Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Retrieved November 15, 2008, from Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. Idemitsu supplied lubricant to the South Manchuria Railway After success in Japan, Idemitsu & Co. expanded to Manchuria (China) in 1914 where the Japanese-owned South Manchuria Railroad Co. Ltd. was a major customer of lubricant. A branch was opened in Dalian, northeast China and Idemitsu attempted to enter the Chinese market that was dominated by western companies like Standard Oil and the Asiatic Petroleum Company (a Shell subsidiary). The company extended through northern China and into Korea and Taiwan. After the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1932 the oil trade became government controlled and Idemitsu was forced to scale back. Instead he went into transport by oil tanker. In 1940 the headquarters were moved to Tokyo and the name changed to the current Idemitsu Kosan K.K. (kabushiki kaisha: stock company). With the Japanese military expansion and United States joining the Pacific War the government took control of all industries. === Postwar era === After the war Idemitsu Kosan lost its overseas trade with the Allied occupation of Japan. It was among the ten petroleum suppliers selected by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) and cut its ties with Nippon Oil. Idemitsu began importing naphtha (an intermediate oil product) first from the United States and later from Venezuela and Iran. The protectionist Oil Industry Law helped Idemitsu against foreign competition in Japan, but also made owning its own refineries important. Idemitsu's first Tokuyama Refinery opened in 1957. This was followed by the Chiba oil refinery in 1963, Hyogo oil refinery in 1970, the Hokkaido oil refinery in 1973, and the Aichi oil refinery in 1975. In 1953 Idemitsu sent its large tanker Nisshomaru to Iran to purchase oil. Iranian prime minister Mohammed Mosaddeq had recently nationalized the oil fields and was under British-led embargo (Abadan Crisis). Idemitsu managed to buy the oil at 30% below market price and displeased the British. This was popular with the Japanese public but got Idemitsu in conflict with the Japanese government and MITI. Later the same year was the 1953 Iranian coup d'√©tat. In the 1960s, Idemitsu imported crude oil from Russia. Again, it got a good price at 40% below market value but angered the United States who decided to boycott Idemitsu when buying fuel for its military jets in Japan. Idemitsu called the boycott \\"an odd Christmas gift\\" but \\"utterly negligible.\\" In 1978 it broke off contracts with the Soviet Union. The company also came in conflict with the Petroleum Association of Japan which was set up by MITI to restrict production and Idemitsu even left the organization. In 1965 the seamen's union went on strike, the first of its kind in Japan. This led to petroleum shortages. Idemitsu then ignored the quotas and produced at full speed. When the price control and production quotas were removed in 1966, Idemitsu rejoined the PAJ. To please the MITI, Saz≈ç Idemitsu's younger brother Keisuke Idemitsu took over as company president, while Saz≈ç became chairman of the board, keeping the actual control. In 1992 Idemitsu Kosan began constructing oil platforms in the North Sea (not the pictured platform) The company continued its vertical integration strategy of controlling the whole supply chain with more tankers and opening petrol depots and warehouses. In 1976 it started drilling for oil and gas in the offshore Aga Field in the Niigata Prefecture (Sea of Japan). Commercial production began in 1984. Idemitsu took interest in foreign oil fields, and in 1987 it started an oil field in southeast Turkey with Finnish company Neste Oy. Idemitsu acquired stake in Norwegian Snorre oil field and in Australia, as well as participating in oil drilling around the world. The company diversified into coal, importing from Australia and bought mines in Muswellbrook, New South Wales and Ebenezer, Queensland. It became the largest coal mining company in Japan and developed the coal cartridge system for small users. It worked on geothermal power experiments and uranium mining in Canada with Cameco and Cogema. The sharp 1985 price drop on oil made Idemitsu's non- oil operations less profitable. Japanese import restrictions on oil once again came under debate. As in 1962, Idemitsu favored opening up to foreign competition, in opposition to most of the Japanese oil industry. The Japanese government eventually settled on a compromise that would slowly open for free importation and remove production quotas on refineries. As a means of diversifying its business in the wake of global oil shocks, Idemitsu began development of OLED technology in the 1980s, culminating in the development of a practical full-color LED display introduced by Pioneer in the late 1990s. Idemitsu's technology was eventually adapted by Samsung Electronics for use in its Galaxy line of smartphones. === 1990s and early 2000s === Idemitsu was quick to open self-service gas stations when it was allowed in Japan in 1998. By 1997 Idemitsu was the largest seller of fuel oil in Japan, due largely to capital investments by president Shosuke Idemitsu during the 1980s and early 1990s. However, these investments left the company deeply in debt with a speculative credit rating. Akihiko Tembo, the first president from outside the founding family, instituted several reforms to alleviate the company's finances, including cutting retroactive discounts offered to distributors. Tembo also merged parts of the company's operations with Mitsubishi Corporation and Mitsui Chemicals. In the 1990s, Idemitsu began opening service stations outside Japan, in Portugal and Puerto Rico, as well as a lubricant factory in the United States. Oil industry deregulation took big leaps with the abolishment of the Special Petroleum Law and self-service pumps became legal. Toward the end of the 1990s, the demand in Japan decreased due to the long economic crisis. The oil industry was too large and many companies merged. At the turn of the century, Idemitsu Kosan was the only major oil refining company in Japan that had not merged. The company was entirely held by the Idemitsu family and company employees. In 1994, Unioil became the exclusive distributor of Idemitsu products in the Philippines. In 2006 Idemitsu Kosan became publicly traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange after an initial public offering (IPO), raising 109.4 billion yen. === Showa Shell merger === In 2016, Idemitsu management announced plans to merge the company with Showa Shell Sekiyu, the fifth-largest oil wholesaler in Japan. The transaction was opposed by the founding Idemitsu family for several reasons, reportedly including ongoing friction between the family and Tembo's management team, cultural differences between the two companies, geopolitical issues (Idemitsu being a major importer of Iranian oil while Showa Shell would remain partly owned by Saudi Aramco), and pressure from rival JX Nippon Oil & Energy which was simultaneously planning its own merger with TonenGeneral. Without approval from the Idemitsu family for a full merger, company management purchased 31% of Showa Shell in December 2016, and launched partnerships in refining and logistics starting in April 2017. Showa Shell was ultimately acquired by Idemitsu in 2018; it was absorbed into Idemitsu in 2019. ==Oil extraction and shipping== The daughter company Idemitsu Oil & Gas Co., Ltd. produces about of crude oil per day. The primary sources is Idemitsus stake in Norwegian oil fields in the North Sea (North Sea oil). The first and largest Snorre oil field has been followed by several more. In the Sea of Japan, Idemitsu has oil platforms in Niigata prefecture near Aga and Iwafune, but the production is small. There are exploration projects in Vietnam, Thailand and Cambodia. In Vietnam, the exploration is together with Russian Zarubezhneft and the Vietnam Oil & Gas Group (Petro Vietnam). Idemitsu Kosan owns 12 oil tankers for international use. ==Refining== Idemitsu owns four refineries: * Hokkaido Refinery, Hokkaido, () * Chiba Refinery, Ichihara, Chiba, * Aichi Refinery, Aichi, * Tokuyama Refinery, Tokuyama, The Hyogo and Okinawa refineries were closed in 2003 after an agreement that Nippon Oil would supply Idemitsu Kosan with of petroleum products. Tokuyama Refinery was shut down in 2014 as scheduled, in conjunction to the Hokkaido Refinery gaining an increase in oil supply.Byrd, Miemie Winn (2005-09-07). Asia-Pacific Economic Update 2005 Volume III . United States Pacific Command. p. 128. There are 30 operating refineries in Japan with total capacity of , giving Idemitsu Kosan a 13% share of the refining capacity. The company claims between 14% and 34% market share for different products. Idemitsu Kosan is planning to build the Nghi Son Refinery in Vietnam in a joint venture with Kuwait Petroleum International, Vietnamese state-owned PetroVietnam and Mitsui Chemicals. With construction planned to start in 2010, it would be ready in 2013 and become the second in Vietnam after the Dung Quat Refinery. Idemitsu Kosan owns a 35.1% stake in the $6 billion, refinery. Idemitsu has opened an office in Hanoi and is considering using the refinery as a base for expanding into Vietnam and surrounding countries. ==Petroleum== An Idemitsu service station in Japan Idemitsu operates 5,250 service stations, many under the Apollo brand. ==Petrochemical products== Idemitsu Petrochemical runs two petrochemical plants in Chiba and Tokuyama. It produces a variety of basic chemicals supplied to chemical industries, in Japan and abroad. In Europe it markets through Idemitsu Chemicals Europe PLC. Basic chemicals produced includes olefins such as ethylene and propylene, and aromatics like benzene, para-xylene and styrene monomer. It is also a supplier of plastics for uses such as CD pressing and circuit boards. The two naphtha crackers can produce up to 997,000 tonnes of ethylene per year. Lubricants, Idemitsu's first product is a major area. It also produces fluorescent materials for OLED displays. A joint venture with German company BASF, BASF Idemitsu Co. Ltd., produces 1,4-Butanediol for the Japanese market at Idemitsu's Chiba plant. Idemitsu also produces some medical drugs. == Intellectual property == Following a 2009 cross-licensing agreement between LG Display Co., Ltd. and Idemitsu Kosan's OLED materials business, Idemitsu Kosan purchased a 32.73% stake in Global OLED Technology LLC in June 2010. For $100 million, LG purchased Kodak's organic light emitting diode business in December 2009 and created Global OLED Technology to administer and develop a portfolio of 2,200 patents based on Kodak research. ==Other energy sources== * A subsidiary, Idemitsu Alaska Inc., held the original permit for the Wishbone Hill coal mine in southcentral Alaska, from 1991 to 1995.http://www.adn.com/article/20141128/feds-scold-state-usibelli-permit- renewals The permit is currently held by Usibelli Coal Mine, Inc. * The company owns four coal mines in Australia producing 10 million tons per year. * It participates in a uranium mine development in Cigar Lake Mine in Canada. * Idemitsu is working on geothermal power in ≈åita Prefecture, Japan.

The Club reformed in 1956 and used one of the Sandbach School's rugby pitches on which to play home games. Local premises near to the school playing fields were used as changing rooms and the Iron Grey, a local pub, was used as a base for after match hospitality. Old boys from Sandbach School were encouraged back to the game and the Club grew from strength to strength. In 1960 the Club began admitting non-old boys and in May 1961 a piece of land on Middlewich Road which backed onto Sandbach School premises was purchased and the first Clubhouse was built. In the summer of 1980 Old Sandbachians moved from Middlewich Road to Bradwell Road where a new Clubhouse and pitches had been developed. By the start of season 1981‚Äì82 the Club had changed its name from Old Sandbachians to Sandbach Rugby Club. Sandbach has a rich history of producing top quality players and over the past 20 years the Mini/Junior section has produced a steady stream of top flight players. In the spring of 2012, Premiership side, Sale Sharks featured five ex-Sandbach players in a Premiership game against Wasps. In 2011, Sandbach became a CASC (Community Amateur Sports Club), reaffirming their principles of not paying players and staying true to their vision as a community based club.

The play, which draws upon the literary tradition of pastoral, is notable for its allegorical content relating to Queen Elizabeth I, for whom the first production was performed at the Earl of Leicester's country estate at Wanstead.University of Oregon's etext and analysis Queen Elizabeth was asked to mediate the outcome of the masque itself. ==Plot summary== A woman approaches the queen whilst walking in Wanstead Garden as a supplicant, saying that her daughter - the Lady of May - has two suitors, and that she would like the queen to judge which of the two should win her hand. Having left, a crowd of people come into view. There are six foresters and six shepherds (among them the suitors), the Lady of May herself, and a schoolmaster called Rombus. After a brief quarrel between Rombus and the May Lady, the two suitors, Therion and Espilus, begin a singing competition. With this finished a second debate starts between Rixus, a forester (like Therion) and Dorcas, a shepherd (like Espilus). This is moderated by Rombus. The Queen judges Espilus to have won the contest and Espilus sings to celebrate. Finally, the characters take their leave of the queen and the play ends. ==Allegorical Content== The critic Helen Cooper has suggested that the figures of Therion and Espilus relate to two real life suitors of Queen Elizabeth, the Earl of Leicester and Sir Christopher Hatton respectively.Cooper, H. (2004). Pastoral: Mediaeval into Renaissance. D.S. Brewer The etymologies of the names are used as evidence of this claim: Therion comes from the Greek meaning 'wild beast', which relates to Leicester's badge of a bear, and Espilus comes from the Greek meaning 'felt presser', which is a description of a hatter (from which occupation the surname of Hatton originates). Sidney's recommendation of Hatton for Elizabeth's hand would have been particularly edgy given that Wanstead, where the play is both set and presented, was owned by Leicester, who would presumably have been present at the performance. Other interpretations of the allegory see the contest as relating to the French Catholic Prince Alen√ßon.'Poetry, patronage and the court' in The Cambridge Companion to English Literature, 1500-1600 ==Publication history== This masque was first published (though without a title) in Sidney's 1598 folio of the Arcadia. ==References== Category:Literature of England Category:English plays ","title":"The Lady of May"},{"id":"20199099","text":"Qend√´r Dukas is a former municipality in the Fier County, southwestern Albania.

Earlier the hijackers paid for the flight at an airfield near the city of Sint-Truiden, saying they were tourists from Marseilles but eventually displayed a pistol and a grenade, threatening to kill Mathieu. He reported that he landed near 200 inmates. One climbed on board while the hijackers threw tear gas canisters into the crowd. The helicopter then landed less than a half-mile from the prison, where Ferdinand and the two hijackers got in a waiting car and drove off. Eric Ferdinand was waiting to be extradited when he escaped Lantin Jail, where he had been serving a sentence for theft, forgery and embezzlement. Ferdinand was later arrested. In September 2007, Ferdinand was extradited from Italy to Belgium. In February 2008, he was sentenced to six years in prison for the escape.

He served as a member of the Virginia House of Delegates from 2003 to 2020, representing the 40th district. Hugo was defeated in the 2019 election by Democrat Dan Helmer. ==Overview== From 2003 to 2020, Hugo served in the Virginia House of Delegates, representing the 40th district in Fairfax and Prince William counties. The district encompassed both the incorporated and unincorporated areas of Clifton in Fairfax County. It also included unincorporated parts of Centreville, Fairfax, and Fairfax Station in Fairfax County as well as unincorporated sections of Catharpin, Gainesville, Haymarket, and Manassas in Prince William County. Approximately 80% of the district's population and 65% of its landmass is located in Fairfax County. A member of the Republican Party, Hugo was the House of Delegates' majority caucus chairman. Hugo served on the Commerce and Labor (2007‚Äì2020), Education (2003), Finance (2004‚Äì2020), Privileges and Elections (2003‚Äì2006 and 2010‚Äì2020), Science and Technology (2007‚Äì2020), and Transportation (2003‚Äì2020) committees. While the 40th district is historically Republican-leaning, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton bested Republican nominee Donald Trump by an eight-point margin (51‚Äì43%) in the 2016 presidential election. In the 2017 elections, Democrat Donte Tanner challenged Hugo, but narrowly lost. Despite having about 14% of the state's population residing within its boundaries, following the 2017 elections, Hugo remained the only Republican in the Virginia General Assembly to represent a district based in Fairfax County. Hugo lost reelection in 2019 to Democrat Dan Helmer. At the time of his defeat, he was the last Republican to represented a significant portion of Fairfax County above the county level. ==Education and professional career== In 1986, Hugo earned a Bachelor of Arts (BA) from the College of William & Mary. In 1987, he received a Kodak Fellowship (FS) from the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. Between 1990 and 1998, he served in the United States Army Reserve.

Thus, from a solution to the graph canonization problem, one could also solve the problem of graph isomorphism: to test whether two graphs G and H are isomorphic, compute their canonical forms Canon(G) and Canon(H), and test whether these two canonical forms are identical. The canonical form of a graph is an example of a complete graph invariant: every two isomorphic graphs have the same canonical form, and every two non-isomorphic graphs have different canonical forms... Conversely, every complete invariant of graphs may be used to construct a canonical form.. The vertex set of an n-vertex graph may be identified with the integers from 1 to n, and using such an identification a canonical form of a graph may also be described as a permutation of its vertices. Canonical forms of a graph are also called canonical labelings,. and graph canonization is also sometimes known as graph canonicalization. ==Computational complexity== Clearly, the graph canonization problem is at least as computationally hard as the graph isomorphism problem. In fact, graph isomorphism is even AC0-reducible to graph canonization. However it is still an open question whether the two problems are polynomial time equivalent. While the existence of (deterministic) polynomial algorithms for graph isomorphism is still an open problem in computational complexity theory, in 1977 L√°szl√≥ Babai reported that with probability at least 1 ‚àí exp(‚àíO(n)), a simple vertex classification algorithm produces a canonical labeling of a graph chosen uniformly at random from the set of all n-vertex graphs after only two refinement steps. Small modifications and an added depth-first search step produce canonical labeling of such uniformly-chosen random graphs in linear expected time. This result sheds some light on the fact why many reported graph isomorphism algorithms behave well in practice... This was an important breakthrough in probabilistic complexity theory which became widely known in its manuscript form and which was still cited as an \\"unpublished manuscript\\" long after it was reported at a symposium. A commonly known canonical form is the lexicographically smallest graph within the isomorphism class, which is the graph of the class with lexicographically smallest adjacency matrix considered as a linear string. However, the computation of the lexicographically smallest graph is NP-hard. For trees, a concise polynomial canonization algorithm requiring O(n) space is presented by .. Begin by labeling each vertex with the string 01. Iteratively for each non-leaf x remove the leading 0 and trailing 1 from x's label; then sort x's label along with the labels of all adjacent leaves in lexicographic order. Concatenate these sorted labels, add back a leading 0 and trailing 1, make this the new label of x, and delete the adjacent leaves. If there are two vertices remaining, concatenate their labels in lexicographic order. ==Applications== Graph canonization is the essence of many graph isomorphism algorithms. One of the leading tools is Nauty.. A common application of graph canonization is in graphical data mining, in particular in chemical database applications.. A number of identifiers for chemical substances, such as SMILES and InChI use canonicalization steps in their computation, which is essentially the canonicalization of the graph which represents the molecule. These identifiers are designed to provide a standard (and sometimes human- readable) way to encode molecular information and to facilitate the search for such information in databases and on the web. ==References== Category:Graph theory ","title":"Graph canonization"},{"id":"20199293","text":"John Faiman (June 24, 1941 ‚Äì June 16, 2012) of Omaha, Nebraska was a University of Nebraska Cornhusker quarterback. A two-time All-American quarterback at Omaha South High School, Faiman played quarterback for the Huskers from 1960 to 1962, starting the first game of 1962 which also was the first game for new head coach Bob Devaney. Faiman was head coach of the Bellevue West High School Thunderbirds in Bellevue, Nebraska. Faiman died on June 16, 2012, of a brain aneurysm at the age of 71. == Early career == John Faiman was a standout quarterback for Omaha South High School. He was selected as a Senior Scholastic Magazine All-American his junior year in 1958. As a senior in 1959 he was selected as a Teen Magazine All-American Midwest HC, guiding the Packers to a share in the state title; He also led the Nebraska high school Shrine Bowl South team to a 7-6 victory over the North team at Rosenblatt Stadium in Omaha, Nebraska. == College career == Faiman began his college career in 1960 at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln during the tenure of head coach, Bill Jennings. In his junior year in 1962 Faiman started as quarterback for head coach Bob Devaney's first game and season home opener with a 53-0 win over the University of South Dakota. That same year as PAT kicker, he broke his right leg in practice in early November ending his Nebraska playing career. Faiman wore numbers 11, 21, 15 during the years 1960, 1961 and 1962, respectively. === Playing statistics === 1962 Passing: 11 attempts, 5 completions, 1 interception (.455) for 63 yards, (5.7 avg.). Rushing: 5 attempts, (7 yards gain/30 yard loss) net of -23 yards, (-4.6 avg.) Total Offense: 16 plays, 40 yards, (2.5 avg.). Scoring: PAT kicks 10 attempts/7 made; PAT pass 1 attempt/0 made, (7 total). == Coaching career == After college Faiman began coaching in the late 1960s. In 1968, he was coaching high school football in David City, Nebraska, and served as assistant coach at the 1968 Nebraska (high school) Shrine Bowl. By 1976 he returned to his alma mater, Omaha South High School, as head football coach. In 1977 Faiman was an assistant coach at Washington State University under former Nebraska player, Warren Powers. He next became the offensive line coach at University of Missouri from 1978 to 1983 under Powers. Faiman also has been a line coach at the University of Utah (1983‚Äì1984) and Kansas State University (1985). Regarding coaching college football, Faiman is quoted as saying: \\"Cletus Fischer (former Nebraska assistant coach) told me to get out of college football, because everyone was getting fired ‚Äì I'm glad I did.\\" Faiman held the position of head football coach at Bellevue West High School in Bellevue, Nebraska since 1985, earning ten state playoff appearances. He has also served as past staff of Rimington Youth Football Camp (a football camp run by fellow Omaha South High School alum and Nebraska Cornhusker player Dave Rimington). == Personal life == Fairman has two sons who played football at Bellevue West High School. One son, Kelly, played in the 1989 Nebraska Shrine Bowl, and the other, John, played fullback during Bellevue's 2005 season. ==References == Category:1941 births Category:2012 deaths Category:American football quarterbacks Category:Kansas State Wildcats football coaches Category:Missouri Tigers football coaches Category:Nebraska Cornhuskers football players Category:Utah Utes football coaches Category:Washington State Cougars football coaches Category:High school football coaches in Nebraska Category:People from Bellevue, Nebraska Category:Sportspeople from Omaha, Nebraska Category:Players of American football from Nebraska ","title":"John Faiman"},{"id":"20199310","text":"Tritonia is a genus of sea slugs, nudibranchs, shell-less marine gastropod molluscs in the family Tritoniidae.Bouchet, P.; Gofas, S.

The Yan-nha≈ãu speaking Yol≈ãu people are the traditional owners of the land and sea of the Castlereagh Bay area. ===History and Culture=== Yan- nhangu people own an area of the Arafura sea and thirty one islands of just under . Sometime after 1600 the annual arrival of Maccassan sailors harvesting trepang (bech de mer) changed the timings and patterns of Yan-nhangu people's seasonal movements around the Crocodile Islands. The arrival of the Methodist mission to the island of Milingimbi in 1922 attracted large numbers of eastern of kin to settle permanently on the Yan-nha≈ãu estate. Before colonization, the number of Yan-nhangu people remained small, just a few hundred, with no more than fifty or so people belonging to each of the six clans (ba:purru). The Yan-nha≈ãu are a Yol≈ãu people with a distinctly marine orientation arising from intimate coexistence with their salt water country. The sea is a crucial aspect of Yan-nha≈ãu society, religion and language. The ocean‚Äôs movements, sounds and changes are considered to be physical indexes of ancestral action. People share their names with the names of the ocean, its waves, colors, spirits, and winds. The six Yan-nha≈ãu language types are distinctive and may be used to distinguish Yan-nha≈ãu people from their neighbors. The Yan-nhangu language, the sites and phenomena of their seas and islands are all understood to be the bequest of the creation ancestors. Yan-nhangu estates, religious identities and languages are ancestral endowments that form linkages of connection and difference throughout the networks of Yolngu society. Yan- nhangu clan identities, estates, language and ritual resources are passed down through patrilineal descent. Yan-nhangu people continue to perform the rich ritual, musical, dance and artistic practices shared by Yolngu kin throughout north-east Arnhem Land. More so they continue through ritual and practical actions to care for their marine environments. ===Varieties=== Within Yan- nha≈ãu there exist six clan (b√§purru) based varieties, three of which are Dhuwa and three of which are Yirritja. The Dhuwa varieties spoken today are those of the Gamala≈ãga, Gorryindi, and M√§·∏ªarra groups. Yirritja Yan-nhangu speakers belong to the Bindarra, Ngurruwulu and Walamangu patri-groups of the Crocodile Islands.James.

Author‚Äôs collection. ==GrammarPhonology and alphabet=== Yan-nha≈ãu phonology is typical of Yol≈ãu languages, Pama‚ÄìNyungan languages, and Australian languages in general. There are six places of articulation with a stop and a nasal in each, as well as laterals, glides, and a trill. There is also a glottal phoneme, ', and a three vowel system common in Australian languages. Consonants Yan-nha≈ãu is written with six voiceless and six voiced stops. However, these are not contrastive. If a stop occurs word- initially it is written voiced, while word-final stops are written voiceless. Yan-nha≈ãu does not contain any fricatives, which is common for Australian languages. Lamino-dental consonants do not occur at the end of a word, but are in general more common than their alveolar counterparts. All consonants are represented in the table below. { border=2 cellpadding=2 style=\\"border- collapse:collapse\\" class= !rowspan=2 !colspan=2 Peripheral !colspan=2 Laminal !colspan=2 Apical !rowspan=2 Glottal - !

Long vowels can only occur in the first syllable of a word. Stress is always given to the first syllable of a word, regardless of vowel length. { border=2 cellpadding=2 style=\\"border-collapse:collapse\\" class= !short !long - a √§ - i e - u o } ===Parts of speech=== The most important parts of speech in Yan-nha≈ãu are nouns and pronouns, verbs, adjectives, and particles. Nouns and Pronouns In Yan-nha≈ãu, nominals (nouns and pronouns) often take case suffixes to denote their grammatical role in a sentence. While nouns and pronouns carry out similar functions within a sentence, they differ in how they are marked. Cases that are marked by suffixes are the ergative, absolutive, dative, allative, locative, associative, originative, animate oblique, perlative, human ablative, proprietive, privative, and ‚Äòkinship proprietive‚Äô. A more detailed description of suffixes for nouns and pronouns is given in the morphology section. =Examples of nouns= *ratha 'baby', 'child' *mo·∏ª' 'snake' *wu≈ãgan 'dog' *wa·∏ªirr 'sun' *guya 'fish' *muru 'food' =Pronouns= Yan-nha≈ãu pronouns exist for first, second, and third person in both singular and plural forms. In the plural form, a distinction is made between dual and plural (if there are just two people or if there are more than two people.) Additionally, the first person plurals differentiate between inclusive (including the listener) and exclusive (the listener is not included). {  border=\\"1\\" - ! ! Singular ! Dual ! Plural (more than two people) -    Inclusive --- Exclusive  Inclusive --- Exclusive -  1st person  ≈ãarra  ≈ãali ----------- ≈ãalinyu  lima ----------- napu -  2nd person  nhunu  ------------------nhuma  ------------------nyili -  3rd person  nhani  ------------------balay  ------------------dhana } Like nouns, pronouns are subject to transformation through morphological suffixes. Also, the addition of the suffix ‚Äìpi or -bi to a pronoun transforms the pronoun into its emphatic form, which may be used to stress that person‚Äôs involvement in the action of the sentence, or to differentiate him or her from the sentence‚Äôs other pronouns, if they are present. Verbs Yan-nha≈ãu verbs denote action within the sentence. Their conjugation is somewhat unusual and does not follow the standard inflections to denote temporal change. Rather, there are four major forms (primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary), each of which is used to denote tense or mood. The primary is used to indicate the present or future tense as well as the ‚Äòyesterday‚Äô past, the secondary is used most often for commands or as a future/irrealis, the tertiary is used to show past actions, and the quaternary usually serves as the habitual or irrealis. The exact delineation of the conjugation classes of Yan-nha≈ãu verbs is not definite, but there exist groups of verbs that can be classified on the basis of their conjugations. See verb morphology for a detailed explanation. Particles Particles are an essential component of Yan-nha≈ãu verb conjugation. Added to a sentence before a verb in the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary form, they provide additional information about tense or mood. For example, the continuous particle mana is used very frequently in combination with the primary verb form to show a present continuous action that approximates the present progressive. Other particles include: *ba·∏èak ‚Äì with secondary, continuous imperative *baka ‚Äì with secondary, indicates future irrealis *b√§y≈ãu ‚Äì with primary, present habitual *bilagu - with secondary acts as future irrealis, with quaternary shows conditional irrealis *gurrku - with primary, indicates future tense *mananha - with tertiary, shows past continuous *nhakali ‚Äì with secondary, indicates ‚Äòshould‚Äô *wanha - with tertiary, shows completion of an action Adjectives Yan-nha≈ãu adjectives may come before or after a noun. They can but are not required to take the grammatical suffix of the noun that they modify. They may also be used as adverbs to modify verbs. =Examples of Adjectives= *yindi ‚Äòbig‚Äô *miku ‚Äòred‚Äô *miri≈ãu ‚Äòbad‚Äô *dhunupa ‚Äòstraight‚Äô *mulkuru≈ãu ‚Äòforeign‚Äô *bu·∏ªa≈ãgitj ‚Äògood‚Äô =Example adjectival vs. adverbial sentences= :Nha≈ãu ratha miri≈ãu. : this child bad :' This child is bad.' :≈äarra mana miri≈ãu wa≈ãa Yan- nha≈ãumurru :1sg cont. bad see- Yan-nha≈ãu-perl. : ' I speak Yan-nha≈ãu badly.' ===Syntax=== Noun Morphology Verb transitivity plays an important role in Yan-nha≈ãu morphology. If a noun is the subject of a transitive sentence (meaning that the verb has an object) it receives the ergative suffix. The ergative suffix is also used as an instrumental marker to show that a noun is being used by the sentence subject to carry out the transitive action. The subject of an intransitive sentence takes no morpheme ending. Pronouns do not receive ergative suffixes and take no ending as the subject of a transitive sentence. Inanimate objects of transitive verbs do not take a suffix, while humans and many animals take the accusative ending, as do the pronouns representing them. Morpheme suffixes are also used to mark dative nouns in Yan-nha≈ãu sentences. The dative ending is also used to turn nouns into possessives and is also attached to objects of the verb dj√§l, ‚Äòwant‚Äô. The associative morpheme is used to show that something is ‚Äòrelated to‚Äô or ‚Äòassociated with‚Äô a noun. The animate oblique is used only for human and animal nouns to mean ‚Äòwith‚Äô or ‚Äòat‚Äô the animate noun. The locative morpheme signifies ‚Äòat a location‚Äô or ‚Äòwith‚Äô or ‚Äòon‚Äô something, and the originative denotes that the subject of the clause is ‚Äòfrom‚Äô an object, which becomes the human ablative if the object is animate. The privative indicates ‚Äòwithout,‚Äô the allative ‚Äòto‚Äô or ‚Äòtowards,‚Äô and the perlative ‚Äòthrough‚Äô or ‚Äòalong.‚Äô A noun can be made into an adjective using the proprietive, with signifies ‚Äòhaving.‚Äô For example, ratha, ‚Äòbaby‚Äô becomes rathaway, meaning ‚Äòpregnant.‚Äô In a similar way, adding the privative morpheme suffix, transforms a noun into an adjective showing ‚Äòwithout.‚Äô Finally, the ‚Äòkinship proprietive‚Äô is a noun suffix that is used to show familial relationships. Morpheme suffix categories may have one or more allomorphs, which are given in the table below. The choice of allomorph for a particular word is determined by the final phoneme of the noun stem. { border=2 cellpadding=2 style=\\"border-collapse:collapse\\" class= ! Morpheme Suffix ! Allomorphs - Ergative/instrumental -thu -yu or -dhu - Human/animate accusative -nha - Dative -ku, -gu - Associative -bu - Animate Oblique -kara, -gara - Locative -≈ãa, -la - Originative -≈ãuru - Human/animate ablative -ku≈ãu, -gu≈ãu - Allative -li - Perlative -murru - Proprietive -way - Privative -nharra≈ãu - ‚ÄòKinship proprietive‚Äô -'mirri≈ãu } Verb Morphology Conjugation of Yan-nha≈ãu verbs can be predicted mostly by patterns in the primary forms of the verbs. The following table is a classification scheme of Yan-nha≈ãu verbs and their conjugations in the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary forms. {  border=\\"1\\" - ! Class ! Primary ! Secondary ! Tertiary ! Quaternary ! English translation -  1: verbs ending in ‚Äìthun / -yun  gabatthun  gabatthu  gabatthana  gabatthala  run -  2: verbs ending in ‚Äìkuma / -yuma / -miyama (garama and wakalama are similar but slightly irregular)  buma garama wakalama  bu≈ãu garama wakala  bunha garanha wakalanha  buwa garawa wakalawa  hit go crawl -  3: verbs ending in ‚Äìtjirri / -yirri  yindiyirri ≈ã√§tji  yindiyi ≈ã√§tji  yindiyina ≈ã√§tjina  yindiyala ≈ã√§tjiyala  get big cry - 4: verbs ending in ‚Äìa  ≈ãorra bamparra wa≈ãa  ≈ãorritji bampirriyi wa≈ãayi  ≈ãorrinha/≈ãorrunha bamparranha wa≈ãanha  ≈ãorriyala bampirriyala wa≈ãayala  sleep stand talk -  5: verbs ending in ‚Äìan / -a·πâ  ≈ãupa·πâ bathan  ≈ãupa batha  ≈ãupa·πâa bathana  ≈ãupala bathayala  chase cook -  6: No change (Macassan loan words)  dj√§ma  dj√§ma  dj√§ma  dj√§ma  work -  Irregular  ben byena bhapiyan bin(a)(munu)  biya nyiniyi nhapiya biya  binha nyininha nhapiyanha binha  birra nyininiyala nhapiyala biyamunu  eat sit do what? do this } Adding one of the gerundial allomorphs ‚Äìnara, -nhara, or ‚Äìnara to the end of a verb in its tertiary form transforms the verb into a noun. Conversely, nouns may be transformed into verbs by the addition of one of the allomorphs ‚Äìtjirri, -yirri, or ‚Äìdjirri, ‚Äòbecome,‚Äô or ‚Äìkuma, -guma, or ‚Äìyuma, ‚Äòmake.‚Äô =Examples of verb to noun transformations= wapthana ‚Äòjump‚Äô --> wapthananara ‚Äòjumping' bamparra ‚Äòstand‚Äô --> bamparranhara ‚Äòstanding‚Äô =Examples of noun to verb transformations= yindi ‚Äòbig‚Äô --> yindiyuma ‚Äòto make big' bu·∏ªa≈ãgitj ‚Äògood‚Äô --> bu·∏ªa≈ãgitjkuma ‚Äòto make good‚Äô bambay ‚Äòblind‚Äô --> bambayyirri ‚Äòto become blind‚Äô borum ‚Äòripe‚Äô --> borumdjirri ‚Äòto ripen‚Äô Reduplication Reduplication of some Yan-nha≈ãu verbs can be used to express intensification or the habitual or repeated nature of the action, a common feature of indigenous Australian languages. One of more of the verbs initial syllables may be repeated in this process and phonetic transformations may occur, depending on the verb in question. =Examples= gabatthun ‚Äòrun‚Äô --> gabagabatthun ‚Äòkeep running‚Äô dhurrguyun ‚Äòshake something‚Äô --> durrgudhurrguyun ‚Äòshake something repeatedly/vigorously‚Äô bil‚Äôyun ‚Äòturn‚Äô --> bilyu‚Äôpilyun ‚Äòkeep turning,‚Äô ‚Äòturn repeatedly‚Äô Word Order Word order in Yan-nha≈ãu is relatively free, that is, there are many ways to form a grammatical sentence by varying the order of the words therein. This is due to the morphology of the language, whereby the function of a word in a sentence is denoted by its suffix and not its position. While it is not the case that any arrangement of words will create a logical sentence, the following examples show the flexibility of word order in Yan-nha≈ãu. 1) Nhapiyan nhunu gurrku? :Do what 2sg. future particle :' What will you do?' Alternatively: Nhunu gurrku nhapiyan? 2) Mo·∏ª‚Äôyu dharrkthana rathanha :snake- bite- baby- :' The snake bit the baby.' Alternatively: Rathanha dharrkthana mo·∏ª‚Äôyu. 3) Nha≈ãu gulkuru≈ãu wurrpa·πâ. :This small emu :' This is a small emu.' Alternatively: Gulkuru≈ãu wurrpa·πâ nha≈ãu, Or: Wurrpa·πâ gulkuru≈ãu nha≈ãu. ==See also== *Yol≈ãu *Yol≈ãu Matha *Dual (grammatical number) *Transitivity (grammatical category) *Australian Aboriginal kinship ==NotesReferences== *James, Bentley, Laurie Baymarrwa≈ãa Djarrga, M., Gularrbanga,R., Nya≈ãbal, R., Nyu≈ãunyu≈ãu, M., Yan-nhangu Dictionary. 1994‚Äì2003. *Baymarrwa≈ãa, L., Gularrbanga, R., Milinditj, L., Nya≈ãbal, R., Nyu≈ãunyu≈ãu, M., Warr≈ãayun, A., Bowern, C.

It was initially handled by national bodies with public investments, and productive wells were transferred free of charge to the final user. Since the mid-1980s, under the framework of privatization and liberalization of the economy, national investment in exploration has been reduced. No new plants have been commissioned in the period 2000‚Äì2005 (Zheng et al., 2005; Battocletti et al., 2000). The only electricity-producing fields are located in Tibet. According to the \\"2005 Chinese Geothermal Environment Bulletin\\" by China's Ministry of Land and Resources, the direct utilization of geothermal energy in China will reach 13.76 cubic meters per second, and the geothermal energy will reach 10,779 megawatts, ranking first in the world. ==Projects== The most important field is Yangbajain Geothermal Field, with eight double flash units for a total capacity of 24 MW, fueled from a water dominated shallow reservoir at 140 ¬∞C ‚Äì 160 ¬∞C with 18 wells of average depth 200 m. The field extension is only 4 km2, although there are clear indications of a total thermal anomaly of 15 km2. The annual energy production is approximately 100 GW¬∑h, about 30% of the needs of the Tibetan capital, Lhasa. A deep reservoir has been discovered beneath the shallow Yangbajing field. It is characterized by high temperatures (250‚Äì330 ¬∞C has been measured at 1,500‚Äì1,800 m depth). The field potential is estimated at about 50‚Äì90 MW. It is still un-exploited. A 2,500 m deep well has been drilled in 2004, reaching the deep reservoir at 1,000‚Äì1,300 m. Its evaluation is ongoing. Additional plants are installed in Langju, West Tibet (two double flash unit, 1 MW each, 80‚Äì180 ¬∞C) and a 1 MW binary power station (60‚Äì170 ¬∞C) is operating in Nagqu. Two small 300 kW plants are operating in Guangdong and Hunan. Taken from Ruggero Bertani's paper, \\" World Geothermal Generation 2001-2005: State of the Art\\", published in Proceedings of the World Geothermal Congress 2005, Antalya, Turkey, 24‚Äì29 April 2005. ==Direct uses== Total thermal installed capacity in MWt: 3,687.0 Direct use in TJ/yr: 45,373.0 Direct use in GW¬∑h/yr: 12,604.65 Capacity factor: 0.39 This country is again one of the major users of the direct-use of geothermal energy. Zheng et al. (2005) discusses the latest developments. It appears that along with the restructuring of the economy, national investment in geothermal has decreased. However, as the living standard of the population has risen, geothermal has found favor in that the waters are used more for health, tourism, and balneology in various hot springs Investors are looking to increase their investment, which has led to an upsurge in geothermal drilling and utilization particularly in the coastal regions of Beijing and Tianjin The Chinese government is culling together plans for comprehensive geothermal development in conjunction with its 13th five-year plan, which covers the years 2016-2020. As part of this plan, it hopes to develop 100 MW of geothermal by 2015 in northern, central and southwest China. It will initially focus on high-temperature resources, them move to low- and medium-temperature applications The management of the resource also plays a big role particularly in the large cities. Here, efficiency in utilization has improved dramatically and environmental concerns are being addressed. For example, in Beijing the total rate of extraction of hot water has been kept stable and has even decreased slightly but energy utilization in terms of GWh produced has increased significantly. The data of Zheng et al. (2005) show that for the whole of China the installed capacity has risen to 3,687 MWt with an annual energy use of 45,373 TJ/yr (including 15 heat pump units ranging from 220 to 760-kW in capacity operating at an equivalent 2,880 full-load hours annually), from the 2000 (Lund and Freeston, 2001) figures of 2,282 MWt and 37,908 TJ/yr an increase in annual energy use of about 20%. Geothermal space heating covers 545.5 million m2 and greenhouse heating cover about 1.33 million m2. There are about 1,600 public hot spring bathing houses and swimming pools, including about 430 where balneology and medical practices prevail in the country. The details of the specific uses are as follows: district heating (550 MWt and 6,391 TJ/yr); greenhouse heating (103 MWt and 1,176 TJ/yr); fish farming (174 MWt and 1,921 TJ/yr); agricultural drying (80 MWt and 1,007 TJ/yr); industrial process heat (139 MWt and 2,603 TJ/yr); bathing and swimming (1,991 MWt and 25,095 TJ/yr); other uses (monitoring) (19 MWt and 611 TJ/yr); and heat pumps (631 MWt and 6,569 TJ/yr). ==See also== *Renewable energy in China *Wind power in China *Solar power in China *Bioenergy in China *Renewable energy by country *Geothermal power *Hydroelectric power in China *Geology of China *Xianyang‚ÄîChina's \\"geothermal energy city\\" ==References== *Geothermal Resources in China *Geothermal power in China *EASTERN CHINA Geothermal Education Office ==Further reading== *Hu, K.; Nakagaki, O.; Fukuda, M.

In addition to these three venues, the district is home to the Anaheim/Orange County Walk of Stars, hotel and the hospitality industry of Anaheim, Angel Stadium of Anaheim, and the Honda Center. In 2013, the City of Garden Grove announced that it would rebrand its stretch of Harbor Boulevard immediately south of Anaheim city limits as Grove District ‚Äì Anaheim Resort, in partnership with the City of Anaheim to promote the Anaheim Resort District. This section contains nine resort hotels and a number of dining and shopping locations, and was joined by the Great Wolf Lodge hotel and waterpark in 2016. ==History and development== The opening of Disneyland in 1955 created the boon of a tourism boom in the Anaheim area. Walt Disney had originally intended to purchase additional land to build accommodations for Disneyland visitors; however, the park's construction drained his financial resources and he was unable to acquire more land. Entrepreneurs eager to capitalize on Disney's success moved in and built hotels, restaurants, and shops around Disneyland and eventually boxed in the Disney property, and turned the area surrounding Disneyland into the boulevards of colorful neon signs that Walt Disney had tried to avoid. The city of Anaheim, eager for tax revenue these hotels would generate, did little to obstruct their construction. In the 1990s, while Disneyland was undergoing a significant expansion project surrounding the construction of Disney California Adventure Park, the city undertook a project of its own in the area surrounding the Disney property and Anaheim Convention Center. The project included removing the colorful neon signs and replacing them with shorter, more modest signs, as well as widening the arterial streets in the area into tree-lined boulevards. The name \\"Anaheim Resort\\" was coined to refer to the area. ==Location== The Anaheim Resort district is generally bounded by the Santa Ana River to the east, Ball Road to the north, Walnut Street to the west, and the Garden Grove city limits to the south at Chapman Avenue, and Orangewood Avenue to the southwest.

G. Meurer: Penbui-W√§chter an der St√§tte der Wahrheit, Eine prosopographische Untersuchung zu Deir el-Medine in der 19. Dynastie, London 2015, , pp. 68-69 The relationship between Penbuy and Kasa likely comes through Penbuy's first wife Amentetwosret. It is not clear however if Amentetwosret was Kasa's sister or daughter.Benedict G. Davies, Who's who at Deir el-Medina: A Prosopographic Study of the Royal Workmen's Community, Nederlands Instituut voor het Nabije Oosten, 1999, Penbuy: pg 194-195, genealogical chart 29; Kasa: pg 267-273, genealogical chart 28 ==Tomb== The left side of the chapel shows several scenes of people offering to seated couples. Many of the names are illegible however. The right side of the chapel shows a scene depicting Kasa and his wife Bukha'nef with a daughter. In another register the tomb, four mummies and a funeral procession are depicted. The mummies seem to be Kasa, his son Nebamentet, his wife Bukha'nef and a lady of the house named Hathor. A son named Neferemsenut and a daughter named Sheritre are depicted standing before the mummies. In another scene a son of Kassa named Ptahmose is mentioned. Ptahmose's wife is named Sheritre.K.A. Kitchen, Ramesside inscriptions, Vol 3: Translated and annotated. Notes and comments, 2000, pg 493-500 On the ceiling of the chapel inscriptions again identify Kasa and his wife Bukha'nef, while another mentions Penbuy and his wife Amentet-wosret. In the innerchapel Penbuy and his brother Penshen'abu are shown before Amenhotep I. Ahmose Nefertari and the pharaohs Sethi I, Ramesses I and Horemheb. In a nearby scene Ramesses II and the vizier Paser are shown offering to Ptah and Hathor.G.

When the Embassy brand was created, as a rebranding of Strand, more effort was put into developing and launching it than any other previous cigarette brand.B. W. E. Alford (2006) WD & HO Wills and the Development of the UK Tobacco Industry, 1786-1965, Taylor & Francis, Embassy Filter was introduced in 1962 and was Britain's top-selling brand from 1964 until 1970, when it was overtaken by Player's No. 6. It had a 24% of the market in 1968.\\"Smoking and the 70s\\", RetroWow In 2001, Embassy No. 1 had a 3.1% share of the UK licit cigarette market, and an estimated 4.8% share of the illicit market (based on seizures).\\"Select Committee on Public Accounts Minutes of Evidence: APPENDIX 3 - Supplementary memorandum submitted by HM Customs and Excise\\", House of Commons - Public Accounts - Minutes of Evidence In 2004, Embassy accounted for 24% of the premium segment of the UK market.Emily Paersch \\"Finding the right balance, Tobacco Journal Two-time snooker world champion Alex Higgins sued the makers of Embassy in 1999, claiming that the encouragement from the sponsors to smoke Embassy cigarettes, and the free cigarettes given to players, had contributed to his contracting throat cancer.Gentleman, Amelia (1999) \\"Snooker star sues tobacco firms\\", The Guardian, 27 July 1999 Embassy's price of a packet of 20 cigarettes is currently ¬£9.54 RRP. Embassy also has a sister brand, named Embassy Regal. In 2019, the Embassy Number 1 Red changed blend, the price has reduced, and the taste has changed. The Embassy Regal has remained the same. In April 2014, the last factory that still produced cigarettes in Nottingham, United Kingdom which also produced the Embassy cigarettes, was closed and production was moved to a foreign country such as Germany or Poland. In December 2014, Imperial Tobacco celebrated the 100 year existence of the Embassy brand. Rebecca Cottee, brand manager ‚Äì factory manufactured cigarettes, at Imperial Tobacco said: \\"As one of our most iconic brands Embassy is and continues to be an intrinsic part of Imperial Tobacco‚Äôs heritage. For a brand like Embassy to survive for 100 years is a great achievement, particularly as the category has seen so many newcomers over the last 50 years. Premium priced cigarettes continue to be strong sellers within the category. It‚Äôs vital that independent retailers ensure constant availability of leading brands, such as Embassy, as many tobacco shoppers will leave a store and go elsewhere without making any purchase if their preferred brand is not available.\\". Various promotional material was made to sponsor Embassy cigarettes, such as magazine advertisements. A slogan used was \\"Inhale to your heart's content!\\" ==SponsorshipsFormula 1=== The Shadow DN1 entered and raced by Graham Hill being demonstrated at the 2008 Goodwood Festival of Speed. In 1973, Embassy became the title sponsor of the new Embassy Racing With Graham Hill (commonly known as Embassy Hill) Formula One motor racing team, founded by two-time World Champion Graham Hill. Hill was also the team's lead driver for its first two years, but Embassy Hill did not enjoy success, securing only three points-scoring finishes in three years of racing. In 1975, Hill, his driver Tony Brise and four other members of the team died in an aircraft accident. The team was closed afterwards. Embassy sponsored a private-entry Shadow Racing car for Graham Hill who ran his car under the Embassy Hill banner in 1973. ===Snooker/Darts=== In 1976, Embassy was the primary sponsor of the World Snooker Championships from 1976 to 2005 as well as the World Professional Darts Championship from 1978 until 2003, when the UK government banned all tobacco sponsorship in sport.\\"History \\", Imperial Tobacco\\"Snooker hunts replacement for Embassy\\", Marketing Week, 14 April 2005Harrison, Shirley (2000) Public Relations: An Introduction, 2nd edition, Cengage Learning EMEA, , p.152 ===Beauty pageants=== Embassy also sponsored the Miss Ghana beauty pageant. ==Markets== Embassy is mainly sold in the United Kingdom, but also was or still is sold in Ireland, Germany, Spain, Tanzania, Malawi, Kenya, South Africa, Mauritius, Pakistan, Malaysia, Canada, United States, Trinidad and Argentina. ==ProductsCurrent UK Brands=== *Embassy Mild/Blue *Embassy Filter *Embassy Number 1 ===Discontinued UK Brands=== *Belair Menthol *Embassy Envoy *Embassy Gold *Embassy Number 3 *Embassy Number 5 *Embassy Number 3 Extra Mild *Embassy Number 5 Extra Mild *Embassy Extra Mild *Embassy Number 1 Extra Mild *Embassy Premier with NSM (New Smoking Mixture) *Embassy Crushball ==References * Sponsorship ban Category:Imperial Brands brands ","title":"Embassy (cigarette)"},{"id":"20199836","text":"John Sanford Barnes John Sanford Barnes (May 12, 1836 - November 22, 1911) was a United States Navy officer and businessman and naval historian. ==Biography== Barnes was born at West Point, New York, in 1836, while his father, General James Barnes, served as an instructor there. He entered the US Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland, at age 14, serving after his graduation aboard Preble, and under Commodore Stewart on San Jacinto in Europe and the West Indies, and on Saratoga. He was aboard Arctic when it participated in the first survey for the original Atlantic cable in 1856. The following year, aged 21, he was appointed assistant professor of ethics at the US Naval Academy, and after a subsequent year in private business he was appointed master of Jamestown. In 1858 he resigned his commission and attended Albany Law School. After passing the bar he practiced law until 1861. During the American Civil War, he returned to the Union Navy, initially as navigator of Wabash, and later as commander of Dawn, Paul Jones, Lenape, and Bat.

He was born in Allerthorpe, Yorkshire, around 1621. Little is known of his parents or education, except that his father died when he was eight years old.Smith, p. 19. ==Early life== Dewsbury studied both scripture and other religious texts from an early age. Until around the age of 13 he worked as a shepherd in Allerthorpe, after which he became an apprentice to a weaver in Holbeck. In 1642, his brief experience in the Parliamentary Army led him to reject fighting with \\"carnall\\" weapons on religious grounds. Dewsbury travelled to Edinburgh, having become interested in Presbyterianism, but was disappointed by the formality of the Scottish faith.Smith, pp. 29‚Äì30. It is unknown when Dewsbury married, but a date of around 1649 has been proposed. It is known that his wife, whose first name was Ann, came from York, and that they were married in an Anabaptist ceremony.Smith, p.45‚Äì46 The couple unsuccessfully attempted to regain in court some former property of Ann Dewsbury, which had been taken by her brother. ==Conversion and preaching== In 1651 Dewsbury met the prominent English Dissenter and early Quaker George Fox in the house of a Lieutenant Roper, near Balsby.Smith, p. 52. Also present were Thomas Goodaire, James Nayler and Richard Farnsworth. In 1652 he became a Quaker minister, and travelled through Westmorland, Cumberland and Lancashire preaching. During this journey, both Dewsbury and Robert Widders, an associate, were attacked by a group of Baptists while speaking in Carlisle, and Widders was later imprisoned.Smith, pp. 59‚Äì60. He spoke in Sedbergh in 1653, and was imprisoned in York after being accused of blasphemy by a local priest in 1654. However, he was set free by proclamation soon afterwards when the authorities realised that the evidence against him was spurious.Smith, p. 73. Dewsbury died in Warwick on 17 June 1688. ==Publications== *The breathings of life to God's spiritual Israel, through a faithfull follower of the Lamb, in the regeneration and kingdome of patience and tribulation; and now a sufferer in bonds for the testimony of the Lord Iesus, known to the world by the name of William Deusbury ‚Äì London: [s. n.], printed in the year 1663 [i. e. 1664] *Christ exalted, and alone worthy to open the seals of the book.

His surname was originally Pitlo, but he added the extra \\"o\\" because he was often mistaken for an Italian while resident in Italy.Giancarlo Alisio, Il Cimitero degli Inglesi, Naples, 1993, . In Italian he is also known as Antonio van Pitloo. ==Biography== Pitloo started studying painting first at Paris and then at Rome, where there was already an international artistic colony, in 1811. He took advantage of a scholarship offered by Louis Bonaparte, the King of Holland. In 1815, after the fall of Bonaparte, the scholarship payments ceased. He was then invited to Naples by the Russian diplomat and art connoisseur Count Grigory Vladimirovich Orloff (1777 ‚Äì 22 June 1826). In 1816, Pitloo won, in a public competition, the post of professor of landscape at the Neapolitan Academy. Lord Napier lauded him as a landscape painter: :his manner is not very careful or scholastic, but full of sensibility. His pencil is always true to general effects, whether his canvass represents the prospect basking in the mid-day brightness of the Italian sky, or the waves flashing in the train of the level sun, or the fields refreshed and steaming in the dawn; every color finds its counterpart on his palette, and no aerial magic is so evanescent as to elude his subtle imitation: although not so perfect in the delineation of particular objects, he could touch the different kinds of foliage with sufficient exactness; his foregrounds were managed with taste; and his figures, being prudently removed to some distance from the eye, formed an agreeable adjunct to the inanimate scene.Lord Napier, page 69 La Lanterna del Molo (date unknown) In 1820 he married Giulia Mori and thus became a citizen of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. He became a lecturer at the Art Institute of Art at Naples where he specialized in pastoral painting. Around 1826 he was living in Vicoletto del Vasto 15, with Carl G√∂tzloff, Giacinto Gigante and Teodoro Duclere. Gabriele Smargiassi was his pupil and successor at the Academy. Another pupil was Vincenzo Franceschini. He remained in Naples until his death during a cholera epidemic. He was buried in the English Cemetery there. He was considered a leading exponent of the \\"Posillipo School\\" of painting, named to the area where he lived in Naples. His paintings have been compared to precursors of Impressionism, some sixty years before this was invented. ==References== Category:1790 births Category:1837 deaths Category:19th-century Dutch painters Category:Dutch male painters Category:Dutch engravers Category:Italian vedutisti Category:Dutch landscape painters Category:People from Arnhem Category:18th-century Neapolitan people Category:Deaths from cholera Category:Accademia di Belle Arti di Napoli faculty Category:19th-century male artists Category:19th-century Neapolitan people ","title":"Antonie Sminck Pitloo"},{"id":"20199935","text":"R√©ver Humberto Alves Ara√∫jo (born 4 January 1985), simply known as R√©ver, is a Brazilian footballer who plays for Atl√©tico Mineiro. Mainly a central defender, he can also play as a defensive midfielder. He has won the Bola de Prata and Pr√™mio Craque do Brasileir√£o twice each. ==Club careerPaulista=== Born in Ariranha, S√£o Paulo, R√©ver started his career at Paulista, a S√©rie B football club based in Jundia√≠, and was promoted to the first team in 2004. He was a part of the Paulista Championship runner-up squad and contributed to the major title of the club, the 2005 Brazilian Cup. R√©ver soon became an important first teamer alongside Marcio Mossor√≥ and Victor and attracted many other big Brazilian clubs. Despite the bad campaign in the Libertadores in 2006, he stood out and went on loan to Al-Wahda, a football club based in Abu Dhabi. ===Gr√™mio=== In early 2008, after the relegation to the S√©rie C and the Campeonato Paulista poor campaign, Paulista sold half of R√©ver's rights and sent him on loan to Gr√™mio, reuniting with former teammate Victor. He quickly gained a first team spot and established himself as one of the bests defenders in the championship, being also one of the team's vice- captains. On November 12, Gremio obtained the other half of his rights and R√©ver signed a new five-year contract. He was an ever-present figure during the following campaigns. ===Wolfsburg=== In January 2010 R√©ver signed a five- year contract with VfL Wolfsburg.R√©ver: ‚ÄûIch will nie mehr zur√ºck‚Äú He only appeared in an UEFA Europa League match against Fulham, being on the bench during the Bundesliga season. R√©ver playing for Atl√©tico Mineiro in 2012 ===Atl√©tico Mineiro=== On 19 July 2010 R√©ver was announced as an Atl√©tico Mineiro player for the 2010 S√©rie A on club president Alexandre Kalil's personal Twitter account. R√©ver debuted for Atl√©tico Mineiro a month later, being called up for the national time in the meantime, and became team captain in the second half of the season. The following season was difficult for the club in the S√©rie A, struggling against relegation, but R√©ver won the Pr√™mio Craque do Brasileir√£o for best centre-back in the competition. In 2012, R√©ver captained the team in its undefeated Campeonato Minero victory, and through its S√©rie A title contest with Fluminense. Despite the club finishing as runner-up, R√©ver again was selected for the team of the year, in both the Craque do Brasileir√£o and the Bola de Prata awards, together with teammate Leonardo Silva. R√©ver remained as club captain in the following season, in which he won the Campeonato Mineiro and the Copa Libertadores with the club. In 2014, he became Atl√©tico Mineiro's top goalscoring centre-back in history with 22 goals, a record later surpassed by Leonardo Silva, who replaced R√©ver as captain in the middle of the season as he struggled with injury. After winning the 2014 Recopa Sudamericana with the club, another injury made R√©ver eventually lose his first-squad status to Jemerson in the later half of the season, and in 2015 he was allowed to leave by the club's board. ===Internacional=== On 14 January 2015 R√©ver joined Internacional on a 3-year and a half contract. ===Flamengo=== On 8 June 2016 Internacional accepted to loan R√©ver to Flamengo on a one-year spell as he had lost space in the first team squad and consistently suffered injuries. He debuted for his new club scoring the game winner header against Cruzeiro on 15 June 2016 at Mineir√£o Stadium. ===Return to Atl√©tico Mineiro=== On 27 December 2018, R√©ver rejoined Atl√©tico Mineiro on a three-year deal. ==Personal life== R√©ver's Brazilian wife holds a German passport.‚ÄûAlles gut‚Äú ‚Äì R√©ver und seine deutschen Wurzeln ==Career statisticsClub=== :(Correct ) {  style=\\"text- align: center;\\" - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Club !rowspan=\\"2\\"Season !colspan=\\"3\\"League !colspan=\\"2\\"Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"Continental !colspan=\\"2\\"Other !colspan=\\"2\\"Total - !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals - rowspan=\\"4\\" valign=\\"center\\"Paulista 2005 rowspan=\\"3\\" valign=\\"center\\"S√©rie B  --20----20 - 2006  ----60--60 - 2007  --------00 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !0!!0!!2!!0!!6!!0!!0!!0!!8!!0 - rowspan=\\"2\\" valign=\\"center\\"Al Wahda 2007‚Äì08 rowspan=\\"1\\" valign=\\"center\\"UAE Arabian Gulf League 100------100 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !10!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!10!!0 - rowspan=\\"4\\" valign=\\"center\\"Gr√™mio 2008 rowspan=\\"3\\" valign=\\"center\\"S√©rie A 352--10--362 - 2009 315--10--325 - 2010  ------3030 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !66!!7!!0!!0!!2!!0!!3!!0!!71!!7 - rowspan=\\"2\\" valign=\\"center\\"Wolfsburg 2009‚Äì10 rowspan=\\"1\\" valign=\\"center\\"Bundesliga 00--10--10 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !0!!0!!0!!0!!1!!0!!0!!0!!1!!0 - rowspan=\\"6\\" valign=\\"center\\"Atl√©tico Mineiro 2010 rowspan=\\"5\\" valign=\\"center\\"S√©rie A 182------182 - 2011 304402040404 - 2012 28641--140467 - 2013 23020122125497 - 2014 71--401080 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !106!!13!!10!!1!!18!!2!!31!!5!!161!!20 - rowspan=\\"3\\" valign=\\"center\\"Internacional 2015 rowspan=\\"2\\" valign=\\"center\\"S√©rie A 172206170323 - 2016  ------8080 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !17!!2!!2!!0!!6!!1!!15!!0!!38!!3 - rowspan=\\"4\\" valign=\\"center\\"Flamengo 2016 rowspan=\\"3\\" valign=\\"center\\"S√©rie A 292--10--302 - 2017 25570132140597 - 2018 262606060442 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !80!!9!!13!!0!!20!!2!!20!!0!!133!!11 - !colspan=\\"3\\"Career total !279!!31!!25!!1!!53!!5!!69!!5!!422!!41 - } {  - !

R√©dei (1921‚Äì2008) was a Hungarian plant biologist, professor, author and member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. == Biography == George R√©dei was born June 14, 1921, in Vienna, Austria, to Kalman and Margit R√©dei. He lived in Hungary, where he finished his formal education, until 1956. He and his wife, Magdolna, moved to Columbia, Missouri in 1957. He began teaching at the University of Missouri (MU) that year. At MU, R√©dei researched the genetics and biology of Arabidopsis thaliana, a small mustard plant. He was the only person in the United States to work with the plant for about 20 years, having begun working with Arabidopsis in 1957 using seeds he had brought with him from Europe. As of 2008, about 16,000 laboratories worldwide were pursuing research with Arabidopsis using his methods. R√©dei used radiation to create mutant collections that were instrumental in the first Arabidopsis genetic experiments. The importance of Arabidopsis as a model system for plant genetics was not immediately appreciated; R√©dei recalled that in 1969, \\"the NSF [National Science Foundation] program director informed me I had to quit Arabidopsis if I wanted to continue to get support\\". R√©dei's efforts later attracted the attention of , who began studying Arabidopsis while at the Wageningen Agricultural University in the Netherlands in 1976. Koornneef ultimately constructed a detailed genetic map, further facilitating Arabidopsis genetic research. In an article in Science published in 2000 when the Arabidopsis genome sequence was first reported, Robert Pruitt (molecular geneticist at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana) stated \\"[R√©dei and Koornneef] were the guys that kept the torch burning [for Arabidopsis] during the dark ages.\\" R√©dei conducted his research in a Curtis Hall office, which had been designed and occupied by Barbara McClintock, who won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1983. R√©dei published approximately 250 papers, notes, letters, book chapters and books. His work appeared in journals including Science, Nature, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, the EMBO Journal, Genes and Development, Molecular and General Genetics, Biochemical Genetics, and Annual Review of Genetics. R√©dei remained at MU until he retired in 1991, but continued teaching as a professor emeritus. He was a visiting professor at the Max- Planck-Institut in Cologne, Germany, and he taught for four years at the E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd University of Basic Sciences in Budapest, Hungary. R√©dei was also a member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. After he retired, R√©dei continued to publish. His works include the Encyclopedic Dictionary of Genetics, Genomics and Proteomics, a Genetics Manual and a two-volume body of work titled the Encyclopedia of Genetics, Genomics, Proteomics, and Informatics. In 2004, MU dedicated the Plant Growth Facilities section of the Christopher S. Bond Life Sciences Center to R√©dei. R√©dei died on November 10, 2008, in Nashville, Tennessee at the age of 87. He had one daughter, Mari R√©dei Tenkhoff, and three granddaughters. == References  * The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) Category:1921 births Category:2008 deaths Category:Hungarian biologists Category:20th-century biologists ","title":"George R√©dei"},{"id":"20199978","text":"Sonic Universe was an American comic book series published by Archie Comics in association with Sega, based on the latter's Sonic the Hedgehog. It is a spin- off of the comic book series of the same name, and shared continuity with that title. Sonic Universe centers on several characters featured throughout the franchise and comics, including Shadow the Hedgehog, Blaze the Cat, and Silver the Hedgehog. The series follows a unique format, in which its lead character and story arc change every four issues, and usually occur concurrently with those in the flagship Sonic title, though within different locations. Sonic himself usually does not appear in these stories, except for occasional supporting appearances. Fleetway, the producers of the UK-based Sonic The Comic series, produced a similar series of stories called \\"Sonic's World\\" from issue 26 onwards; it, too, expanded the fictional universe, following various characters in the Sonic universe on their own adventures, which eventually crossed over into the core series on numerous occasions. Sonic Universe was published monthly by Archie Comics alongside its parent title Sonic the Hedgehog. The first issue was released in February 2009, following the cancellation of Sonic X; issue #94 was the last, released in January 2017. An official Sonic Universe blog was run on Archie Comics' website that would occasionally go into further detail about the events in the stories, such as revealing what happened in the alternate timeline Silver the Hedgehog traveled to in The Silver Saga after he left, but it has since been discontinued. The series subsequently surpassed Knuckles the Echidna as the longest running spinoff of the main series. In July 2017, Sega announced the discontinuation of their business relationship with Archie Comics, and thus the latter will no longer release any further Sonic the Hedgehog comics, including Sonic Universe. ==SynopsisIssues #1‚Äì50=== Issues #1‚Äì4, entitled \\"The Shadow Saga\\", follow Shadow the Hedgehog continuing the events from Sonic the Hedgehog #196 and Sonic X #40. Shadow and Metal Sonic end up on the alternate world that is home to Blaze the Cat, who teams up with Shadow to help him defeat the robot and return to his own reality. Following this, Shadow and Rouge the Bat team up with Sonic the Hedgehog to neutralize a weapon that Dr. Eggman intends to use against Sonic's team of Freedom Fighters and possibly other forces opposed to him. This was followed by Shadow's first encounter with future teammate E-123 Omega, and the pair teaming up with Rouge to become Team Dark and retrieve a Chaos Emerald. Issues #5‚Äì8, covered \\"Mobius: 30 Years Later\\", featuring a return to a possible alternate reality visited in the main series. In this arc, time-traveler Silver the Hedgehog travels to this time period in an attempt to thwart events that will bring devastation to the future from which he hails. In the process, he ends up joining forces with a new team of Freedom Fighters, made up of children of the heroes from the present reality of the series, to thwart the evil King Shadow the Hedgehog, who unleashes a monstrous fusion of Tikal and Chaos from the video game Sonic Adventure. Issues #9‚Äì12, known as \\"Knuckles: The Return\\", in which Knuckles and his teammates, the Chaotix, set out to capture the Echidna villain Dr. Finitevus and punish him for his recent involvement in Knuckles' brief possession by the evil entity Enerjak. As a result of the search, they end up fighting Dr. Finitevus and his temporary allies, a chapter of the Dark Egg Legion composed almost entirely of Platypus members, led by Grandmaster Bill, a former Freedom Fighter. They are joined in battle by the Downunda Freedom Fighters, the local chapter of heroes defending the region. This arc also introduced Thrash the Tasmanian Devil as a temporary Freedom Fighter member, but who acts recklessly and shows particular animosity towards echidnas. Issues #13‚Äì16, called \\"Journey to the East\\" (a parody of the Chinese story Journey to the West), this arc took place between issues #209 and #210 of the main series, and featured Sonic, Tails, Sally Acorn, and their ally Monkey Khan traveling to the Dragon Kingdom, Khan's homeland as well as that of their mutual enemies, the Iron Dominion. The purpose of the journey was to break ties between the Iron Queen and King and the four ninja clans who swore allegiance to them. In the process, the group learned more about characters they had previously encountered, formed a temporary alliance with a group of foes known as the Destructix, and were rejoined by estranged ally Espio the Chameleon, who had left the Chaotix to join his people under the Dominion but became free to rejoin the heroes as a result of the efforts of Sonic's group. Issues #17‚Äì20 were a loose adaptation of the SEGA game Tails Adventure, which was also the title of the arc. As in the game, Tails engages the Battle Bird Armada, a group of birds who have set up a facility near the remote Cocoa Island. In the comic's version of events, Antoine and Bunnie D'Coolette, Tails' fellow Freedom Fighters, joined him on this adventure, having traveled with him to Cocoa Island for an overdue honeymoon. In this story it is discovered the Armada are working with Dr. Eggman, but as an independent force not under his control. The arc also establishes connections between the Battle Bird Armada and the Babylon Rogues, who used to work in the faction. Issues #21‚Äì24, named \\"Treasure Team Tango\\", starred a variety of SEGA characters but primarily featured Amy Rose (only muscular and with a tattoo of a Skull and crossbones as seen in issues #31 and #32), Cream the Rabbit (only with a ripped right ear as seen in issue #32) and Blaze the Cat. The premise of the arc involved Amy and Cream teaming up with a reluctant Blaze the Cat, dubbed \\"Team Rose\\", to locate a nearby Sol Emerald, a magical gemstone that's needed to save Blaze's homeworld. Their search is complicated by the arrival of other parties seeking the gem, including Team Dark, who have been ordered to capture the gem for G.U.N., Team Hooligan, consisting of classic SEGA characters Nack the Weasel, Bark the Polar Bear, and Bean the Dynamite, and Team Babylon, consisting of Jet the Hawk, Wave the Swallow and Storm the Albatross. Issues #25‚Äì28, entitled \\"The Silver Saga\\", featured Silver the Hedgehog visiting another alternate future. In this apocalyptic reality, he teamed up with alternate versions of characters from the present-day series under the leadership of Jani-Ca, the daughter of a corrupted Knuckles the Echidna and his love interest in the series, Julie-Su. Together, this group fought against the villainous Enerjak and his minions, who consisted of robotic slaves created from the stolen life force of various characters previously introduced in the series. The first installment marked the series' first landmark issue. Issues #29‚Äì32, called \\"Scourge: Lock Down\\", focusing on Sonic's evil counterpart from an alternate dimension, Scourge the Hedgehog. Having previously been handed over to an inter-dimensional police force known as the Zone Cops, Scourge had lost much of his confidence and become the punching bag of many of his fellow inmates. However, things change when the Destructix, former allies of his and led by his girlfriend, Fiona Fox, arrive in the jail with plans to break him out. This arc was notable in that it featured no actual SEGA characters, but rather variations of them exclusive to the comic. Issues #33‚Äì36, known as\\"Babylon Rising\\", continued the story of the Babylon Rogues and the Battle Bird Armada. The trio of renegades ended up being forced into rejoining the Armada, and together the two forces set out to locate their lost homeland of Babylon Garden. In this way the arc adapts concepts from the video game Sonic Riders, though again with elements from the ongoing comic series playing a heavy role. This was one of the few arcs to feature Sonic with some prominence, as the Armada eventually attacked the Freedom Fighters' home city in search of their homeland. Issues #37‚Äì40, entitled \\"Scrambled\\", focused on the culmination of a rivalry between Dr. Eggman and his nephew Snively. The latter, having departed the Eggman Empire and set out on his own, disrupts Eggman's operations to some degree, forcing him to restore order. After a brief stop in the United Federation, where Snively approaches his half-sister Hope about joining him and Eggman engages military forces under E-123 Omega, Snively heads to the Dragon Kingdom. There Snively rescued his love interest, the imprisoned Iron Queen, before engaging his uncle in a heated showdown. Issues #41‚Äì44, covered \\"Secret Freedom\\", starring Silver the Hedgehog and his new teammates, the Secret Freedom Fighters. This group, a black ops style unit created and led by deposed king Elias Acorn, set out to thwart the efforts of the evil wizard king usurper Ixis Naugus, and his traitorous apprentice Geoffrey St. John, who planned to dominate the city of New Mobotropolis though ancient mind controlling magic. In doing so, the group operated in disguise and using codenames so as to prevent their true identities from being discovered by Naugus, who would hurt their vulnerable families and friends if found out. Issue #45 was the first single-issue story, and served as an adaptation of the racing game Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed. It is not set in the main continuity. Issues #46‚Äì49 starred Team Chaotix in \\"Chaotix Quest\\", who traveled to the regions of Mercia and the Great Desert in search of their missing teammates, Ray the Squirrel and Mighty the Armadillo. In the process, they ended up involved in conflicts between the Freedom Fighters and Dark Egg Legion Chapters of both regions. Battling the tyrannical Lord Hood in a raid to free prisoners from his medieval dungeon and fighting against the villainous Jack Rabbit, leader of the rogue Sand Blaster Freedom Fighters. Issue #50, Forged In Fire was the second milestone in the series, it would feature a story focusing on Metal Sonic battling Shard the \\"Mecha\\" Sonic, this issue including a reprint of Sonic the Hedgehog #25, the story in which both were first introduced (as the same entity). Originally this issue was planned to feature an epilogue to the animated series Sonic Underground. This was the last issue to be set in the original Pre-Super- Genesis-Wave timeline, which was overwritten by a new reality following the Worlds Collide crossover due to legal issues between Archie and former Sonic writer Ken Penders. ===Issue #51‚Äì94=== Issues #51‚Äì54 were included in Archie's \\"Worlds Collide\\" story arc, a twelve-issue event featuring a crossover between the Sonic the Hedgehog and Mega Man comic series produced by the company. These issues, rather than being chronologically back to back, were instead released in sequence with the Mega Man and Sonic the Hedgehog issues, serving as parts 2, 5, 8, and 11 of twelve. Issues #55‚Äì58 encompassed the \\"Pirate Plunder Panic\\" saga, which directly followed up on the events of the Worlds Collide Crossover, and had connections to the previous Treasure Team Tango arc and the first Sonic Universe arc The Shadow Saga. Amy Rose and Cream the Rabbit, along with recurring anti-villains Bark the Polar Bear and Bean the Dynamite, are transported to the Sol Dimension, the world of Blaze the Cat. The two heroines join up with Blaze and her sidekick, Marine the Raccoon, against a crew of robotic pirates led by the nefarious Captain Metal, in a bid to claim the last of the scattered Sol Emeralds and save Blaze's world from total destruction. Issues #59‚Äì62 covered the \\"Shadow Fall\\" saga, which is a sequel of sorts to the video game Shadow the Hedgehog. In this story, a new Black Comet arrives to threaten the earth, carrying the last remaining members of the alien race, the Black Arms, out to avenge their fallen comrades. Team Dark along with a small squad of troops from G.U.N. have been tasked with infiltrating the comet and detonating an atomic bomb on board to destroy it. Shadow is forced to confront his past as an alien soldier when he faces the new Black Arm's leader, Black Death, and the warrior bred specifically to destroy him, Eclipse the Darkling. Issues #63‚Äì66 encompass the \\"Great Chaos Caper,\\" which runs parallel to the Sonic Unleashed adaptation taking place in the main series. In this, Knuckles and the Chaotix join forces in the hunt for Chaos Emeralds to help the Freedom Fighters in the quest to restore the world to normal after its shattering. In the process, they must contend with the minions of Dark Gaia and the Hooligans, a team of classic Sonic game villains consisting of Nack the Weasel, Bark the Polar Bear, and Bean the Dynamite. Along the way they meet Chip, the Light Gaia. Issues #67‚Äì70 make up the \\"Total Eclipse\\" arc, a sequel to both \\"Shadow Fall\\" and \\"Great Chaos Caper\\", continuing Knuckles and Team Dark's plotlines from both as Eclipse and the Dark Arms land on Angel Island. Team Dark arrives in pursuit of him, and Knuckles reluctantly joins forces with them to hunt down the threat. However, when Eclipse sets out to claim the Master Emerald, Shadow decides to turn it over to G.U.N., enraging Knuckles who fights him to keep the Emerald on Angel Island. Their infighting results in Eclipse taking the Emerald, forcing Knuckles to shatter it and thus leading to his involvement in the main series' storyline. Combined, \\"Shadow Fall\\", \\"Great Chaos Caper\\" and \\"Total Eclipse\\" make up the \\"Dark Trilogy\\". Issues #71‚Äì74 are the \\"Spark of Life\\" arc, which focuses on the artificial intelligence Freedom Fighter known as Nicole. Taking place in a both the \\"Digital World\\" and on Isolated Island (from the game Knuckles Chaotix), it introduces the malevolent computer program Phage and Nicole's creator in the new reality, Dr. Ellidy. Issue #75 is the standalone story \\"Fury\\", in which Sonic and Metal Sonic must race to retrieve one of the Chaos Emeralds. The story involves both characters passing through a gateway known as a Genesis Portal and meeting Silver the Hedgehog, who has been traveling across time and space to shut the portals. Metal Sonic ends up stuck in space at the end of the issue. Issues #76‚Äì78 will form part of the story of Archie's \\"Worlds Unite\\" story arc, a twelve-issue event that marks the second crossover between Sonic and Mega Man, as well as featuring characters from several other Sega and Capcom franchises. Like Worlds Collide, these issues will be released in sequence with the Mega Man, Sonic the Hedgehog, and Sonic Boom comics, serving as parts 1, 5, and 9 of twelve. Issues #79‚Äì82 comprise \\"The Silver Age\\", which follows Silver as he confronts the threat of the Genesis Portals. Helping him on his mission are scientist Professor Von Schlemmer (a character from Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog) and Gold the Tenrec; opposing them is the evil Onyx City Council and their force of Civil Protection Robots. The events of this arc are set prior to the \\"Worlds Unite\\" crossover, despite the issues forming it being released afterward. Issues #83‚Äì86 contain the story arc \\"Eggman's Dozen\\", the title of which is a parody of The Dirty Dozen. The title refers to Dr. Eggman's Egg Bosses-his regional enforcers and leaders of the various units of his Egg Army cyborgs-being assembled by Eggman in order to reclaim the Sonic Unleashed location of Eggmanland from the Naugus Twins. These two villains consist of Walter Naugus- the recurring comics villain formerly known as Ixis Naugus (who first appeared in the Sonic the Hedgehog TV series)-and his sister Wendy Naugus-a new character based on the main antagonist from the game Tails' Skypatrol. Issues #87‚Äì90 make up the story \\"Shattered\\", in which Knuckles and Amy search for the few remaining shards of the Master Emerald, which had previously been shattered in the final issue of \\"Total Eclipse\\". They are joined by Team Dark, who is currently hunting down Eclipse and his Dark Arms; Walter Naugus returns from Eggman's Dozen, plotting to reconstruct the Master Emerald, and disguises himself as an ancient echidna called Nixus to trick Knuckles into giving him the shards. Issues #91‚Äì94 make up the story \\"The Case of the Pirate Princess\\". ==Trade paperbacksSee also== * Sonic the Hedgehog * Sonic X * Knuckles the Echidna * Sonic Boom * Archie Comics * Sonic the Comic * Sonic the Hedgehog (IDW Publishing) * Ian Flynn * Tracy Yardley ==References *BumbleKing Comics :: View topic - Sonic Universe - Exclusive Early Info Category:2009 comics debuts Category:2017 comics endings Category:Archie Comics titles Category:Comics based on Sonic the Hedgehog Category:Comics based on video games Category:Fantasy comics Category:Malware in fiction Category:Comics about parallel universes Category:Sonic the Hedgehog ","title":"Sonic Universe"},{"id":"20199981","text":"Muƒüan (known as Svetlaya Zarya until 2001) is a village and municipality in the Jalilabad Rayon of Azerbaijan.

He was a part of Monaco's 07‚Äì08 CFA squad that won the reserve's professional title (a championship that is reserve for the professional clubs reserves playing in the CFA) scoring 13 goals in 25 matches. Following the season on 13 May 2008, he signed his first professional contract, agreeing to a three-year deal keeping him at the club until 2011. He officially joined the first-team squad for pre-season in July 2008, where he was handed the number 9 kit. Sagbo made three appearances during the pre-season, starting them all including their opening friendly match against fellow Ligue 1 side Toulouse FC, Croatian side NK Zagreb, and Olympique Marseille. He proceeded to make his professional debut on 8 November 2008 in a 0‚Äì1 loss to Olympique Lyonnais, coming on as a substitute playing 17 minutes.Monaco v. Lyon Match Report ===Hull City=== On 26 July 2013, Sagbo signed a two-year contract for an undisclosed fee with English Premier League side Hull City. He made his debut for Hull, on the first day of the 2013‚Äì14 season, playing the full 90 minutes in a 2‚Äì0 loss away at Chelsea. On 24 August 2013, against Norwich City at the KC Stadium, a confrontation between players saw Sagbo given a straight red card for violent conduct. He scored his first goal in English football on 19 October 2013, away at Everton in a 2‚Äì1 defeat, having come on as a substitute. Later in the season, he scored as Hull reached their first-ever FA Cup Final by scoring their first goal in a 5‚Äì3 FA Cup semi-final defeat of Sheffield United at Wembley Stadium; he had also scored an equaliser earlier in the competition to prevent their elimination. In the final, which Hull lost to Arsenal, Sagbo was an unused substitute. At the start of the 2014‚Äì15 season, Sagbo featured only once for Hull, in a League Cup exit. Out of contention with the Tigers, he joined Championship side Wolverhampton Wanderers on an emergency loan om September 2014 that was due to last three months and made his club debut on 1 October 2014 in a defeat to Huddersfield Town. However, after three brief substitute appearances, he dropped out of first team contention, with manager Kenny Jackett citing a lack of fitness and the player's failure during his appearances to \\"state a case for more [gametime]\\". On 13 November he was recalled by Hull City, two months before his loan was due to expire. Jackett subsequently suggested it had been a mutual decision between the clubs. His contract expired in 2015 and Hull City decided not to extend it. ==International career== Sagbo was nominated for the Benin national football team on 30 May 2008 against Angola.African giants seek redemption on www.fifa.com On 10 August 2010, he made his debut for the Ivory Coast national football team against Italy in a friendly game at Upton Park.

The elections were a fierce contest between Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) led by pre-election Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and the Pakistan Muslim League (N) led by Nawaz Sharif. Sharif benefited from the controversial death of Bhutto's brother Murtaza, a populist leader, a worsening economy, and alleged corruption cases against Bhutto's husband Asif Ali Zardari. The elections took place after the previous PPP government was dismissed by President Farooq Leghari for matters of national security. Bhutto's government suffered with financial mismanagement, corruption charges, racial tensions in her native Sindh Province, issues with the judiciary, violations of the constitution, and intra-party and family feuds. After the PPP government was dismissed, a caretaker government was formed under the leadership of Malik Meraj Khalid. The result was a victory for the PML (N), which received most votes ever won by an opposition party. This was the first time PML-N had won an election without being part of any alliance. Sharif subsequently became Prime Minister for a second non-consecutive term. Voter turnout was only 36.0%.Dieter Nohlen, Florian Grotz & Christof Hartmann (2001) Elections in Asia: A data handbook, Volume I, p680 ==Background== The PPP won the largest number of seats in the 1993 election and Benazir Bhutto became prime minister at the head of a coalition government. However, on 5 November 1996, President Leghari, a former ally of Bhutto, dismissed the government 2 years early for alleged corruption and abuse of power. The allegations included financial mismanagement, failing to stop police killings, destroying judicial independence and violating the constitution. A number of PPP party members were detained including Bhutto's husband Asif Ali Zardari who was accused of taking commissions for arranging official deals. A former speaker and member of the PPP Miraj Khalid was appointed interim prime minister. The National Assembly and provincial assemblies were dissolved and elections called for 3 February 1997. Bhutto denied all the charges against herself and petitioned the Supreme Court to reverse her dismissal. However, the court ruled in January that there was sufficient evidence for the dismissal to be justified legally. ==Campaign== Expectations in the lead up to the election were that up to 90 people, possibly including Bhutto and Sharif, might be prevented from standing in the election due to the caretaker governments campaign against corruption. However, by the end of December 1996 the government was forced to acknowledge that they were unable to find sufficient evidence to act against leading politicians. As a result, the election once again became mainly a contest between the PPP and the PML-N. Over 6,000 candidates stood in the election, with 1,758 standing for the National Assembly and 4,426 for the four provincial assemblies. Major campaign issues included corruption, the economy, ethnic and religious conflicts and growing terrorism. However, there was little enthusiasm for the fourth election in 8 years with polls showing only about 20% would vote. Predictions of a challenge by a new anti-corruption party, the Movement for Justice, founded by former cricketer Imran Khan, faded as Khan attempted to fend off personal attacks on PML(N) and Nawaz Sharif. Most forecasts expected Sharif's PML-N to win the election, with them drawing larger crowds than the PPP and appearing to be supported by the army. Opinion polls showed the PML-N leading the PPP by about 40% to 20%. ==Results== The results saw the PML-N win a landslide victory, winning by the largest margin since the 1977 election. Bhutto's PPP was routed, and came second nationally with only 18 seats, and for the first time failing to win any seats in Punjab. Khan's Movement for Justice failed to win any seats. The turnout, at around 36%, was the lowest ever in the history of elections in Pakistan. { class= style=text-align:right !Parties !Votes !% !Seats !+/‚Äì - align=leftPakistan Muslim League (N)8,751,79345.9137+64 - align=leftPakistan Peoples Party4,152,20921.818‚àí71 - align=leftHaq Parast764,2074.012New - align=leftPakistan Muslim League (J)624,2863.30‚àí6 - align=leftAwami National Party357,0021.910+7 - align=leftPakistan Peoples Party (Shaheed Bhutto)377,2282.01New - align=leftJamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F)325,9101.72New - align=leftPakistan Tehreek-e- Insaf314,8201.70New - align=leftBalochistan National Party124,7540.73New - align=leftNational Peoples Party (Khar)85,1210.410 - align=leftBalochistan National Movement72,3540.40New - align=leftJamhoori Wattan Party66,1280.320 - align=leftMuslim Ittehad Pakistan49,6010.30New - align=leftJamiat Ulema-e-Islam (S)48,8380.30New - align=leftPakistan Democratic Party47,1530.20New - align=leftMuslim League (Qayyum)37,7230.20New - align=leftPakistan Awami Party31,6150.20New - align=left30 other parties88,4290.50‚Äì - align=leftIndependents1,482,0337.421+5 - align=leftInvalid/blank votes448,829‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì - align=leftTotal19,516,7161002070 - align=left colspan=5Source: Nohlen et al. } ===Punjab=== {class= style=text-align:right !party !votes !% !seats - align=leftPakistan Muslim League (N)7,370,35159109 - align=leftPakistan Peoples Party2,755,268220 - align=leftIndependent1,355,989116 - align=leftothers977,89580 - align=leftTotal12,459,503100115 } ===Sindh=== {class= style=text-align:right !party !votes !% !seats - align=leftPakistan Peoples Party1,185,5063218 - align=leftHaq Parast748,8212012 - align=leftPakistan Muslim League (N)694,007199 - align=leftIndependent politician507,718145 - align=leftPakistan Peoples Party Shaheed Bhuttto332,47091 - align=leftNational Peoples Party76,78821 - align=leftothers159,01510 - align=leftTotal3,704,32510046 } ===KPK=== {class= style=text-align:right !party !votes !% !seats - align=leftPakistan Muslim League (N)648,9042715 - align=leftAwami National Party371,7221610 - align=leftIndependent politician825,830349 - align=leftPakistan Peoples Party189,81780 - align=leftJamiat- Ulema-e-Islam Fazal-Ur-Rehman166,07770 - align=leftothers194,86680 - align=leftTotal2,397,21610034 } ===Balochistan=== {class= style=text-align:right !party !votes !% !seats - align=leftBalochistan National Party124,754183 - align=leftPakistan Muslim League (N)104,664153 - align=leftJamiat- Ulema-e-Islam Fazal-Ur-Rehman86,531132 - align=leftBalochistan National Movement72,354110 - align=leftJamhoori Wattan Party65,765102 - align=leftPakhtoonkhwa Milli Awami Party56,25980 - align=leftIndependent politician49,80571 - align=leftPakistan Peoples Party52,09080 - align=leftothers67,308100 - align=leftTotal679,53010011 } ==Aftermath== Nawaz Sharif described the results as reflecting the country's desire for an end to chaos. Benazir Bhutto had threatened to not recognise the results if the PPP lost, but despite alleging that election officials had rigged the election by filling in extra ballots, she did not call for protests, saying that Pakistan needed political stability. International observers from the European Union and the Commonwealth of Nations said the election met basic conditions but would not describe it as 'free and fair'. Nawaz Sharif was confirmed as prime minister by the National Assembly receiving 177 votes against 16 for the PPP candidate Aftab Shaban Mirani. He took office on 18 February with a new cabinet named on 26 February. ==References== 1997 general Pakistan ","title":"1997 Pakistani general election"},{"id":"20200264","text":"The 1980 France rugby union tour of South Africa was a series of matches played by the France national rugby union team in South Africa in November 1980.

The parish in North Cork is split into three villages, Glantane, Dromahane and Bweeng. The club was founded in the same year as GAA's founding, in 1884. Cill Seannaigh comes from St. Senach, who founded a church near the present site of the Church of Ireland at Newberry. The club fields Gaelic football and hurling teams in competitions organised by Cork county board, and by the Avondhu division. ==History Early years=== The club goes as far back as 1921, when it played in the Duhallow division. The team in the parish was known as the Lombardstown team. They reached the county final that year, when they were beaten by Redmonds. In 1921, two men were chosen to play for the Cork Juniors against Kerry. They were Sonny Breen and William C. O'Connell. Hurling was very popular in the 1920s and 1930s. The team was known as \\"Brittas Rovers\\". In 1933, Brittas Rovers were beaten by Marshalstown in the North Cork Junior A Hurling Championship final. ===1940s and 1950s=== In 1945, a meeting was held to form one team in the parish called Kilshannig United. In 1950, it was decided to drop \\"United\\" from the name. Things began to look up for the club in 1952, when the novice football team won their first trophies in the Castlemagner Club tournament. In 1953, the club won its first novice championship title, beating Functeon Vale in the final. In the same year, Pat O'Sullivan played with the Cork minor football team. In 1955, Kilshannig reached their first North Cork Junior A Football Championship final. They were beaten by Mitchelstown. The minor footballers also reached their first North Cork final in the same year. In 1959, Kilshannig won its first North Cork final, beating Castletownroche by two points. The team were beaten by Dromtarriffe in the second round of the county. In the same year, Pat O'Sullivan played for the Cork Junior Footballers and the Cork Senior Hurlers. ===1960s=== In 1960, the Junior 'B' hurlers defeated Kilworth in the Championship final. In 1962, Kilshannig won their first ever minor football Championship by defeating Glanworth in the final. Johnny O'Flynn captained the Cork Senior Football team to the Munster Senior Football Championship final against Kerry. Tim Breen and Dan O'Sullivan were also on that team. In 1964, Kilshannig won their first ever Under 21 Football Championship defeating Glanworth. In 1965, Kilshannig won their second North Cork Junior Football Championship, defeating Grange in a thrilling final. Kilshannig were defeated by Dohenys after a replay. In 1967, Kilshannig once again won the North Cork Junior Football Championship by upsetting all the odds, when they beat Glanworth in the final by eight points. That year, Jerry Horgan won an All-Ireland Minor Football Championship medal with Cork. They defeated by Midleton in the County first round. In 1968, Kilshannig repeated the success of the previous year and beat Glanworth again in the final. Unfortunately, Kilshannig were once again knocked out of the first round of the Cork Junior Football Championship, this time by Adrigole. ===1970s=== In 1972, the Kilshannig Minor footballers kept the flag flying by winning the North Cork Championship. However, they were beaten by Macroom in the first round of the county. ===1980s=== In 1985, Kilshannig were victorious in the North Cork Junior Football Championship. Their county championship campaign led to a nail-biting conclusion when they overcame Valley Rovers in the Cork Junior Football Championship final in P√°irc U√≠ Chaoimh following a replay. Their success continued the following year under coach John O'Mahony. Their inaugural campaign in the Intermediate grade was a bittersweet one. A local derby versus near neighbours Mallow drew an enormous crowd to Buttevant. Kilshannig's resounding victory was not on the cards as Mallow had been much more impressive in the previous round, easily defeating Nemo Rangers. The county final was played in Macroom versus Castletownbere. While Kilshannig led for the majority of the game, a late goal snatched victory for the Beara men. After this painful defeat, 1987 proved to be a year for renewal and recharging and a first-round exit to Fermoy resulted. The following year, 1988 brought Kilshannig back to the Cork Intermediate Football Championship final versus Ballincollig on 11 September. Following a thrilling game, a late goal sealed the County Championship for Kilshannig. William O'Riordan received the cup on the steps of P√°irc U√≠ Chaoimh. After a victory in the North Cork Junior B Hurling Championship, the county campaign went well. Ultimately, Kilshannig completed a Cork Intermediate Football Championship and Cork Junior B Hurling Championship double with victory over Whitechurch in Grenagh. Pat Murphy captained the side. 1989 saw the club competing in the Senior grade of football. ===1990s=== Following some near misses in the senior championship, it was decided that the club would re-grade to intermediate and then junior level, in the early years of the 1990s. In 1996, Cork Junior Football Championship honours were secured with a final victory over Youghal. The club continued at an intermediate grade of football for the remainder of the decade. === 2000‚Äì2009 === Kilshannig contested the Junior A football final in 2006 and 2010 against Glanworth and Mitchelstown respectively, losing on both occasions. Kilshannig secured a minor county victory against Nemo Rangers in 2009. === Recent Success === The turn of the decade has seen considerable success for the underage teams of Kilshannig, which bodes well for the future of the club. The 1996‚Äì2000 age groups have been especially responsible for this upturn in fortunes. 2010‚Äì2013 saw the club amass over 10 North Cork championships in both hurling and football between U11 and U14, supplemented by a Cork U15 B Hurling Championship in 2011, and a Cork U13 A Football Championship in 2012. 2012 saw Kilshannig teams playing at Premier level for the first time in our history, with our U13 Hurlers playing at Premier 2. Our underage football teams have consistently performed at Premier level since. Our 1999‚Äì2000 players continued their success with Championship wins at regional level in hurling at U14 and U15 in 2014. Our adults replicated this success, capturing the North Cork Junior A Football Championship for the first time in 18 years, beating Ballyclough in the final before being knocked out of the County by St. Finbarrs. Our U21s were also victorious, defeating Buttevant in the North Cork U21 B final, but eventually tasting defeat at the hands of Courcey Rovers. Since 2015, the club has seen unprecedented success at U21 and Minor level. 2015 saw our minor hurlers claim the Cork Minor B Hurling Championship with a fantastic double win over Kilworth, defeating them in both the County and North Cork final. 2016 topped this further, with the Minors claiming the Cork Minor A Football Championship for the first time in the club's history with a historic win over O‚ÄôDonovan Rossa in CIT, while they also claimed the North Cork Minor A Hurling League. Many members of this panel were leading players with the U16s who claimed a Cork Premier 2 U16 Football Championship, defeating Carbery Rangers in the final, a North Cork U16 A Hurling Championship and League, defeating Ballygiblin in both, and a Cork U16 A Hurling League, coming at the expense of Sam Maguires . These achievements saw the club being awarded the Rebel √ìg Monthly Award for November 2016, as well as the overall award for the entire year. While many believed 2016 could not matched, 2017 proved to be yet another historic year. Between U21 and Minor, an incredible 10 finals were contested in both hurling and football. Success arrived in the form of a Cork U21 B Football and Hurling Championship, defeating Newmarket and Sarsfields in the finals, a North Cork Under-21 B Hurling Championship at the expense of Ballyhea, and a Cork Premier 2A Minor Football League, defeating Valley Rovers in Pairc Ui Chaoimh. The dual U21 win was the first of its kind in the history of the club and gained Countywide recognition. 2018 carried on in similar fashion, with our U21 footballers defeating Mitchelstown in the final of the Avondhu U21 A Football Championship, the first time in 56 years the U21 A has been won by a Kilshannig team. The U21s proceeded to defeat Valley Rovers in the first round of the county, followed by a famous win over St.Finbarrs at the quarter-final stage in Mallow. This journey ultimately came to an end at the semi-final stage, when they were defeated by Nemo Rangers in Mallow on a scoreline of 1-08 2-13. === 2019 === The 2019 Junior campaign started in Carrigoon against Ballyclough in May, winning 3-24 to 0-04. Kilavullen were next in round 2, with the Glantane side winning 1-16 to 0-08. The Avondhu campaign ended in victory for the side beating Kilworth 1-16 to 0-08. The County campaign began in Rathcormac with Kilshannig in flying form against Passage, winning out 4-17 to 0-03. Ballinhassig were next in a tough game but the side won 2-10 to 0-04. The County semi-final was the toughest game of the year however the side came out on top once again, 1-11 to 1-09. The perfect end to the fairytale year saw Kilshannig beating St. James‚Äô in the County Final in a score line of 0-22 to 0-11. The club is looking forward to returning to Intermediate Championship. The side had a clean sweep in Avondhu by also winning out the Junior B(2) Football Championship, Division 1 Football League and Division 2 Football League. The Under-21's also coming up trumps in the division, beating Douglas in the quarter final to secure them a place in the county semi-final against St. Michael's, which the side fell short in the finish. The hurling campaign wasn't as exciting as the football but there were still some great games. The campaign started in Ballyclough, with the side beating Charleville 3-15 to 4-09. Next was Dromina, with Kilshannig coming out on top in Churchtown 0-09 to 2-19. Unfortunately the road came to an end in Killavullen, where Kilshannig lost to Harbour Rovers 2-18 to 0-10. The side beat near neighbours Clyda Rovers 0-19 to 0-09 in Division 1 of the League. The side's second team were bowed out of the Junior C Championship by Fermoy 1-14 to Kilshannig's 0-16. The side fell short again in the League by a point to Milford. The U21's came close to more silverware for the club but were beaten 0-13 to 0-09 by Fermoy. ==Notable players== Recent years have seen Kilshannig being represented at a number of inter-county levels. Killian O‚ÄôHanlon is currently a regular with the Cork Senior Footballers, having already represented Cork at Junior in 2016 and 2017, at U21 in 2014 and at Minor in 2011. 2019 saw Killian start in the 2019 Senior Championship. 2017 saw three further Kilshannig players representing Cork. Brothers Kevin and Conor McMahon were involved with the Cork Minor Footballers, with Conor also representing the U17s. Continuing the clubs recent fashion of dual success, Jack Twomey was a member of the Cork Minor Hurling team. In 2019, the club had 4 representatives on the Cork U20 team that won the All Ireland; √âanna O‚ÄôHanlon, Bill Curtin, Kieran Twomey and Colm O‚ÄôShea. Along with Ciaran O‚ÄôSullivan being a part of the All Ireland Winning Minors. In 2020, the club is well represented at county level again with Killian playing with the seniors and √âanna, Bill, Colm and Kieran with the U20s.

President Elect: 1988 Edition was released in 1987, prior to the 1988 U.S. presidential election, adding the MS-DOS and Atari ST platforms. ==Description== President Elect gives the player the ability to play as various real historical, potential historical, or completely fictional presidential candidates during the Presidential campaigns from 1960 to 1984 (most versions also included the 1988 campaign). Players were given the option of playing a \\"Historical\\" or \\"Ahistorical\\" scenario for each of the given years. Under the \\"Historical\\" option, the candidates, as well as economic and foreign policy conditions, and the status of the incumbent, were fixed. During an \\"Ahistorical\\" session, all those variables could be determined by the player (for example, the player could choose a 1984 race between an incumbent Republican President Ronald Reagan, versus a Democratic Senator Edward M. Kennedy, in the midst of an unpopular war and an economic boom). Alternatively, players could select the option of creating a fictional presidential candidate (or a real candidate from outside of the game's timeframe), through the selection of various political, personal, and geographic attributes (somewhat in the manner of creating an RPG player character). In addition, there was the option of selecting an \\"Ahistorical\\" set of candidates within the otherwise \\"Historical\\" conditions of the selected year. The game came preset with not only all the major candidates of the elections covered by the span of the game, but also a number of hypothetical candidates from across the time frame, such as Jerry Brown, George Romney, Gary Hart, and Howard Baker. 1968 Presidential election simulation, MS-DOS version The game could be played with either two or three candidates (for example, the \\"Historical\\" scenarios for 1968 and 1980 included third party candidates George C. Wallace and John Anderson, respectively, and \\"Ahistorical\\" scenarios for any year could include the addition of a third party candidate), and the computer could control any or all of the candidates (thus allowing for the possibility of a non-player, straight simulation of an electoral scenario), meaning the game could be played by one, two, or three players. Gameplay centered on the activity of dispersing PAPs (\\"Political Action Points\\"), which were approximately equivalent to campaign funds, in terms of their relationship to real life presidential campaigning, as well as scheduling personal, campaign visits to various states. Additionally, at the end of each of the nine, week-long, post-Labor Day game turns, there was a potential debate phase. The role of the vice-presidential running mate was extremely limited, in that the running mate's identity was never given, but rather was simply represented by his or her being from a particular state, thus giving the ticket an electoral advantage in that particular state, and to a lesser extent in the other states within the region of the running mate's home state (for purposes of the game, the country was broken up into seven different regions, corresponding to: New England, the Mid-Atlantic, the South, the Industrial Midwest, the Great Plains, the Mountain States, and the Pacific Coastal States), although the vice presidential candidate's role in any state or region other than his own is nonexistent. But, he can tour foreign countries which if favourable gives an advantage in the elections. Foreign tour can also be performed by presidential candidate. But it shortens the election campaign that can be taken up by him for that particular week depending on the number of days the tour is taken up. Foreign tour costs PAPs depending on the number of days. A failed foreign tour can negatively impact polls, while a successful tour can cause a given candidate to see a polling surge. ==1988 Edition== President Elect: 1988 Edition was released in 1987 for the Apple II and Commodore 64, as well as for the Atari ST and MS-DOS computers. The 1988 Edition did not change gameplay at all, but simply added the historical Reagan vs. Mondale 1984 election, with a new 1988 scenario with no historical candidates. The game also added new playable candidates, such as Bill Clinton, Bruce Babbitt, Michael Dukakis, Richard Gephardt, Geraldine Ferraro, Jack Kemp, and Oliver North. ==Reception== Computer Gaming World found in 1981 that incumbency was the most important factor in winning elections in the original version of President Elect. The review began with the results of a simulated election in which Ronald Reagan won reelection in 1984 with 525 electoral votes from 49 states and 55% of the popular vote, versus Walter Mondale's 13 electoral votes (from Washington DC and Minnesota) and 44%. The results of the real 1984 election were very similar, with the same candidates receiving the same electoral votes from the same states, and a 59%/41% popular vote. President Elect author Nelson Hernandez‚Äîcalling himself \\"the best predictor of presidential elections in the country\\"‚Äîclaimed that, with the 1988 edition of the game, in July 1988 he predicted the electoral and popular votes of the election that year within 1% each of the actual results. Orson Scott Card favorably reviewed the 1988 edition of President Elect for Compute!. While he criticized aspects of the game's design, he noted that the game accurately simulated how \\"the strongest forces\\", like the economy, \\"are completely out of the players' control ... that's the way it works in the real world\\". In 1996, Computer Gaming World declared President Elect the 131st-best computer game ever released. ==Reviews== *The V.I.P. of Gaming Magazine #2 (Feb./March, 1986) ==See also== * The Political Machine series ==References== Category:1981 video games Category:1984 video games Category:1987 video games Category:Apple II games Category:Commodore 64 games Category:DOS games Category:Atari ST games Category:Government simulation video games Category:Strategic Simulations games Category:Presidential elections in the United States Category:United States presidential elections in popular culture Category:Video games developed in the United States ","title":"President Elect (video game)"},{"id":"20200351","text":"The Glacier National Park Tourist Trails, including the Inside Trail, South Circle Trail and North Circle Trail, were established in Glacier National Park to connect a series of tourist camps and hotels established by the Great Northern Railway between 1910 and 1915. Prior to the construction of the Going-to-the-Sun Road, these trails were the primary form of circulation within the park. The trail system includes a number of bridges. The three separate trail systems link Many Glacier, Two Medicine, Cut Bank, Saint Mary and Goathaunt ranger stations and visitor centers. Sites associated with the trail system include the Gunsight Pass Shelter, Packer's Roost, Pass Creek Snowshoe Cabin, Granite Park Chalet and the Ptarmigan Tunnel. ==North Circle== The North Circle Trail describes a loop: Many Glacier - Cosley Lake - Goathaunt - Fifty Mountain - Granite Park - Many Glacier. During the 1920s, tent camps were located at Cosley Lake, Goathaunt and Fifty Mountain, as well as at Red Eagle. The trail's summit follows the Ptarmigan Wall, and was cut and blasted from the cliffside, passing through the Ptarmigan Tunnel to avoid a lengthy detour around the ar√™te. The Park Saddle Horse Company operated multi-day excursions along the trail from 1925, stopping in turn at each camp or chalet. ==South Circle== The South Circle Trail runs Lake McDonald Lodge - Sperry Chalet - Gunsight Pass - Sun Point - Piegan Pass - Many Glacier - Swiftcurrent Pass - Granite Park - Packer's Roost. A five-day route was operated on the trail by the Park Saddle Horse Company. ==Inside Trail== The Inside Trail connects Two Medicine - Cut Bank - Red Eagle Lake - Saint Mary's Lake.The trail passes over Triple Divide Pass, where waters may drain to the Pacific, Atlantic or Arctic Oceans. ==Structures== Packer's Roost West is located at the junction of several trails near the Going-to-the-Sun Road. It serves as a base camp for pack operations over the trails and for service trips to Sperry Chalet and Granite Park Chalet. The Granite Park Trail Cabin is a log structure of standard design, similar to many such structures in the park. ==See also== *Many Glacier Barn and Bunkhouse, also known as Packer's Roost East. ==References== Category:Protected areas of Glacier County, Montana Category:Protected areas of Flathead County, Montana Category:Glacier National Park (U.S.) Category:Park buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Montana Category:Historic trails and roads in Montana Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Montana Category:National Register of Historic Places in Glacier County, Montana Category:Roads on the National Register of Historic Places in Montana Category:1911 establishments in Montana Category:National Register of Historic Places in Glacier National Park ","title":"Glacier National Park Tourist Trails"},{"id":"20200380","text":"Sing Me Back Home is the fifth studio album by American country singer and songwriter Merle Haggard and The Strangers, released in 1968 on Capitol Records. ==Background== The album's title track was inspired by an inmate Haggard knew while he was serving time in San Quentin named Jimmy \\"Rabbit\\" Kendrick. Haggard reports the name as \\"Hendricks\\" in his autobiography, but this appears to be an error. As recounted in his 1981 autobiography Merle Haggard: Sing Me Back Home, Rabbit devised a brilliant escape and invited Haggard to join him, but they both agreed it would be best that he stay put. Rabbit was captured two weeks later and eventually executed for the murder of a state trooper. Haggard, the \\"guitar playing friend\\", wrote the song as a tribute. Writing in the liner notes for the 1994 retrospective Down Every Road, Daniel Cooper calls it, \\"a ballad that works on so many different levels of the soul it defies one's every attempt to analyze it.\\"Down Every Road 1962‚Äì1994 compilation album. Liner notes by Daniel Cooper In a 1977 interview in Billboard with Bob Eubanks, Haggard reflected, \\"Even though the crime was brutal and the guy was an incorrigible criminal, it's a feeling you never forget when you see someone you know make that last walk. They bring him through the yard, and there's a guard in front and a guard behind - that's how you know a death prisoner. They brought Rabbit out...taking him to see the Father,...prior to his execution. That was a strong picture that was left in my mind.\\" The track topped the country singles chart a few weeks into 1968 (his second number one in a row) and he performed it as a duet with Johnny Cash on the latter's network television show in 1969. In his 1999 autobiography House of Memories, Haggard states that the song had been published by Blue Book Music, a company owned by Buck Owens, and when Haggard asked Owens for a sum of money to pay back debts incurred in Las Vegas, Owens agreed only if he received half of ‚ÄúSing Me Back Home,‚Äù to which Haggard agreed. Haggard, who later felt he had been taken, sued to get his ownership of the song back. Although Haggard wrote or co-wrote most of the tracks on Sing Me Back Home, the song credits also list several important figures from his musical past, such as Lefty Frizzell, who wrote \\"Mom and Dad's Waltz\\" and was arguably Merle's biggest musical inspiration. In addition, a young Haggard had played behind both Buck Owens and Wynn Stewart during his time on the Bakersfield club scene, and the album features compositions by both. In fact, Haggard wrote \\"Home Is Where a Kid Grows Up\\" with Stewart and another one of his idols, Bob Wills (Haggard would cut a tribute album in honor of Wills in 1970). While many country LPs during this period were often haphazardly assembled collections of studio cuts and cover songs to support a hit single or two, the quality of Haggard's albums during this period were remarkably high. In his 2013 biography Merle Haggard: The Running Kind, David Cantwell gives part of the credit to producer Ken Nelson: \\"Nelson wasn't a musician himself, and he wasn't a knob-twirling auteur, either...Nelson had an ear for talent and material and for sounds...He was an old school A&R; man, and he had the role's key skill: he could hear pop.\\" Another key ingredient in Haggard's sound during this period was the guitar blend of James Burton and Roy Nichols. As Haggard explained to Downbeat in 1980, \\"James was doing this thing called 'chicken pickin'. But he wasn't really bending the strings. Roy, on the other hand, was doing the string bending but wasn't doing the chicken' pickin'... Our guitar style came out of a marriage between the styles.\\" ==Critical reception== Sing Me Back Home was released on January 2, 1968, and became Haggard's second straight number-one album. At the time of the album's release, Life stated that the title track \\"could be a Top 40 hit tomorrow if the big-city stations would play it.\\" Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic writes: \\"Sing Me Back Home follows the blueprint of Merle Haggard's first three albums, balancing a hit single with album tracks and a couple of covers, but there is a difference. Where the previous album Branded Man was a transitional album, hinting that Haggard's talents were deepening substantially, Sing Me Back Home is the result of the flowering of his talent.\\" ==Track listing== All tracks composed by Merle Haggard; except where indicated #\\"Sing Me Back Home\\" ‚Äì 2:51 #\\"Look Over Me\\" ‚Äì 2:58 #\\"The Son of Hickory Holler's Tramp\\" (Dallas Frazier) ‚Äì 3:00 #\\"Wine Take Me Away\\" (Tommy Collins, Merle Haggard) ‚Äì 2:48 #\\"If You See My Baby\\" (Eddie Miller, Bob Morris) ‚Äì 2:32 #\\"Where Does the Good Times Go\\" (Buck Owens) ‚Äì 2:06 #\\"I'll Leave the Bottle on the Bar\\" ‚Äì 2:41 #\\"My Past Is Present\\" (Merle Haggard, Wynn Stewart) ‚Äì 1:58 #\\"Home Is Where a Kid Grows Up\\" (Merle Haggard, Wynn Stewart, Bob Wills) ‚Äì 1:57 #\\"Mom and Dad's Waltz\\" (Lefty Frizzell) ‚Äì 2:27 #\\"Good Times\\" ‚Äì 2:59 #\\"Seeing Eye Dog\\" ‚Äì 2:41 ==Personnel== *Merle Haggard‚Äì vocals, guitar The Strangers: *Roy Nichols ‚Äì guitar *Norman Hamlet ‚Äì steel guitar *George French ‚Äì piano *Jerry Ward ‚Äì bass *Eddie Burris ‚Äì drums with *Lewis Talley ‚Äì guitar *Billy Mize ‚Äì guitar *Bonnie Owens ‚Äì harmony vocals and *Glen Campbell ‚Äì guitar ==Charts== {  !Chart (1968) !Peak position - Billboard Country LPs align=\\"center\\"1 - } ==References== Category:1968 albums Category:Merle Haggard albums Category:Capitol Records albums Category:Albums produced by Ken Nelson (United States record producer) ","title":"Sing Me Back Home"},{"id":"20200388","text":"P√¶tur J√°kupsson was, from 1588 to 1601, lawman (prime minister) of the Faroe Islands.

In 2008, France requested his extradition for his alleged involvement in the 1980 Paris synagogue bombing. After a lengthy extradition hearing, on June 6, 2011, the Canadian extradition judge described the evidence as \\"convoluted, very confusing, with conclusions that are suspect\\" and stated that \\"the prospects of conviction in the context of a fair trial seem unlikely\\". However, the judge said that his interpretation of Canada‚Äôs extradition law left him no choice but to commit Diab to extradition. On April 4, 2012, the Minister of Justice, Rob Nicholson, ordered Diab extradited to France. Diab's appeal to the Ontario Court of Appeal was rejected and the Supreme Court of Canada refused to hear the case. On November 14, 2014, Hassan was extradited from Canada to France where he was imprisoned for 3 years and two months while the investigation continued. Since then, four French anti-terrorism judges have uncovered testimony from several individuals stating that Diab was in Lebanon at the time of the bombing as well as University records which show he wrote and passed exams in Beirut then and couldn't have been in Paris. They have ordered his conditional release under electronic surveillance eight times, only to have their orders challenged by the prosecutor and overturned by an appeal court. On January 12, 2018, French authorities dropped all charges against Hassan Diab, citing lack of evidence. On January 14 Diab returned to Canada. On January 17, Diab and his Ottawa support committee held a press release at the offices of Amnesty International Canada. ==Early life and education== Diab was born in Lebanon and studied sociology at the American University of Beirut. He received a PhD from Syracuse University in Syracuse, New York. He became a Canadian citizen in 1993, and moved to Ottawa in 2006. He holds dual citizenship. ==Charges== Diab was arrested by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) on November 13, 2008, at the request of French authorities who want him extradited to stand trial for his alleged role in a 1980 bombing outside a synagogue on Rue Copernic in Paris. He faced charges of murder and attempted murder in connection with the bombing, in which four people were killed and dozens injured by the detonation of about of explosives hidden in the saddlebags of a parked motorcycle. Diab denies all charges. His lawyer said the arrest was \\"a mistaken identification\\", and that Diab did not enter France in 1980. Friends, colleagues and former professors of Diab expressed shock and bafflement at the news of his arrest. His thesis adviser, Louis Kriesberg, a noted scholar of conflict resolution, said he never knew Diab to be in any way anti-Semitic and called the news \\"not credible\\". ==Termination of teaching contract== In early July 2009, Diab was hired to teach a summer course in introductory sociology at Carleton University. On July 28, the day after a bail hearing disclosed his employment and subsequent teaching, B'nai Brith Canada released a statement condemning Carleton for employing a suspected terrorist. \\"We find it deplorable that university officials believe that there is nothing wrong with employing Diab. The safety and security of the community as a whole, and of the Carleton University campus in particular, are of great concern to us.\\" The Toronto-based national office of B'nai Brith issued a statement condemning Carleton's actions, while an Ottawa-based member of the group telephoned the university directly to complain. The university confirmed to the CBC that Diab was teaching the course. Later that day, university officials cancelled Diab's contract and named a replacement, stating that Diab had been replaced \\"in the interest of providing students with a stable, productive academic environment that is conducive to learning.\\" \\"The university did the right thing,\\" B'nai Brith's executive vice-president, Frank Dimant, said of Carleton's about-face in not allowing Diab to teach.\\" Some Carleton University professors supported Diab, stating that his termination violates the university's contract obligations. The Canadian Association of University Teachers (CAUT) issued a press release condemning the actions of Carleton's administration. ==The case== Based on information from intelligence agencies of Germany obtained from former members of the group, French authorities allege that Diab was a member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, the group blamed for the bombing. Evidence unsealed as part of the extradition case, in April 2009, included two police sketches made some time after the bombing. Samples of Diab's handwriting, while a student at Syracuse University years later, were subjected to handwriting analysis. The sample of Diab's Syracuse handwriting was compared to the writing on a Paris hotel registration card filled out under the alias Alexandre Panadriyu. One French expert stated that the handwriting was definitely Diab's, though it appeared efforts had been made to change it. Another French expert said Diab could have written the registration card. In October 2009, Diab‚Äôs lawyer submitted to the Canadian court several reports produced by experts in Canada, the United States, France and the United Kingdom. The lawyer informed the court that intelligence experts were prepared to explain the difference between evidence and intelligence and its \\"inherent secrecy and non-disclosure\\". Moreover, handwriting experts, including a top British expert, characterized the evidence tendered by French authorities as \\"demonstrably false\\". The Crown, on behalf of France, retracted the evidentiary nature of its original handwriting experts and asked the court for more time in order to obtain another opinion. The evidence was withdrawn when Diab's lawyer showed that the comparison handwriting samples used were not written by Diab. The reports were the subject of an evidentiary hearing in December 2009. At the end of the hearing, the judge decided that the defence was permitted to file reports from all of their four handwriting experts, and could call any two of these experts to testify at the extradition hearing. The Crown would be allowed to cross-examine all four of the defence handwriting experts if it so chose. The defence called University of Toronto law professor Kent Roach to testify as an expert on the issue of intelligence as evidence at the extradition hearing; he testified as to the unreliability of using intelligence as evidence on November 24 and 25, 2009, in Ottawa. ==Extradition hearing== An extradition hearing had, temporarily, been scheduled to begin in January 2010. However, on December 18, 2009, the Crown Attorney (representing The Attorney General of Canada) requested an adjournment of the hearing to review the defence evidence. The next possible date for the extradition hearing was to have been June 2010. The judge hearing the case stated that he wanted to start the flow of evidence soon and suggested that he was becoming weary of delays by the French government in presenting its case. The hearing was scheduled to begin on November 8, 2010. On May 17, 2010, the hearing scheduled to begin June 14, 2010, was again delayed after France disavowed the evidence of two handwriting experts discredited by the defence. The Crown planned instead to introduce evidence from a third, new French handwriting expert, who found a \\"very strong presumption\\" that Diab was the author of the hotel registration card. Kent Roach, the expert defence witness, accused the French government of \\"dragging its feet\\", \\"cherry picking evidence\\" and \\"bootstrapping\\" by requesting a delay while justice officials in Paris gathered more evidence. Defence counsel called the Crown's new plan \\"absolutely scandalous\\". He went on to say, \\"At the 11th hour and 59th minute they withdraw their entire handwriting case and substitute a new case.\\" Diab's lawyer also accused French authorities of finding a new handwriting expert in an attempt to save their case after the two they originally used were discredited by four defence handwriting experts, including a former RCMP document examiner. On December 6, 2010, the presiding judge ruled to allow the testimony of three more defence handwriting experts, but said that he would not necessarily give it any weight in his final analysis. A former RCMP forensic document examiner, Brian Lindblom, was retained by the defence and testified on December 13, 2010, on the handwriting analysis submitted by France's new, and third examiner, Anne Bisotti. Stating that the new report submitted by the Crown was \\"often confusing and incomprehensible\\", Lindblom criticized the mandate given to Bisotti, by Magistrate Marc Tr√©vidic. Tr√©vidic instructed that the analysis be done to \\"'determine if he (Diab) is certainly or may be the writer.' There appears to be no room for an objective consideration of the possibility that the author of the sample material may not be the writer; he is presumed to be the writer.\\" \\"The mandate is designed not to seek objective evidence,\\" Lindblom testified. Bisotti's handwriting analysis was the third sent to the court after France disavowed two previous analyses when the defence demonstrated their unreliability. ===Judicial decisions=== On June 6, 2011, Justice Robert Maranger committed Diab for extradition and stated that \\"regrettably\\" he had no jurisdiction to grant bail. Diab was taken into custody pending a bail hearing. Maranger said the evidence against Diab was \\"weak\\", but that France had shown a prima facie case and Canada must expect France to give Diab a fair trial. On April 4, 2012, the Minister of Justice, Rob Nicholson, ordered Diab extradited to France to face terror bombing charges. Diab's lawyer was expected to appeal that decision. In May 2014, the Court of Appeal for Ontario confirmed the extradition order, writing that the minister's holding decision was \\"reasonable\\" and that he must be sent to face trial in France. On November 13, 2014, the Supreme Court of Canada refused to hear Diab's appeal. Diab was extradited to France on November 14, 2014, to face investigation by the French legal authorities, as the main suspect of the 1980 attack. Hassan Diab was held in Fleury-M√©rogis Prison, a high security correctional centre in southern Paris. No trial was ever scheduled. In December 2014 an article in the Ottawa Citizen stated that: \\"A French magistrate formally charged Diab the day he arrived in Paris but it is expected to take at least 18 months of investigation before he stands trial, if the French decide to proceed with the case.\\" On May 17, 2016, a French judge released Diab from jail, requiring him to wear a monitoring device, but allowing him to walk alone three hours a day. Prosecutors reportedly filed an appeal to the release order. ===Release=== Diab was released from the French prison on January 13, 2018 shortly after the charges had been dropped by a French judge. Diab returned to Ottawa, Ontario, Canada on January 15, 2018, travelling by way of Iceland, after diplomats were able to secure his immediate return. He had initially been released but ordered to remain in France while the prosecution filed an appeal. ==Aftermath== A professor of international law, as well as other lawyers (including Donald Bayne, who acted for Diab), have cited the Diab affair as an illustration of flaws in Canada's Extradition Act. In May 2018, Amnesty International and the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association jointly called for the federal government to launch a thorough and independent inquiry into Hassan Diab‚Äôs extradition to France, including the conduct of Canadian officials during extradition hearings. In 2018, Minister of Justice Jody Wilson-Raybould ordered reviews of the extradition. Murray Segal was appointed to conduct the external review. Segal's findings were provided to Wilson-Raybould's successor, David Lametti, in May 2019, and subsequently made public several months later. The review cleared Canadian prosecutors of any wrongdoing, but also made recommendations to improve the extradition process. Diab's lawyer, Donald Bayne, called the review a \\"whitewash\\". ==References *Justice For Hassan Diab advocacy website *Friends of Hassan Diab blog * 1980 Paris synagogue bombing Attentat de la rue Copernic wikipedia website Category:1953 births Category:Living people Category:American University of Beirut alumni Category:Syracuse University alumni Category:Canadian sociologists Category:Lebanese sociologists Category:American University of Beirut faculty Category:University of Ottawa faculty Category:Carleton University faculty Category:Lebanese emigrants to Canada Category:Canadian people of Lebanese descent Category:Naturalized citizens of Canada ","title":"Hassan Diab (sociologist)"},{"id":"20200420","text":"Jay Wheals (born 18 March 1978) is a British auto racing driver.

M. (1998). Gastropods in: FAO Species Identification Guide for Fishery Purposes: The living marine resources of the Western Central Pacific Volume 1. Seaweeds, corals, bivalves and gastropods. Rome, FAO, 1998. page 491. The shell outline is oblong or nearly elliptical. The spire is barely distinguishable dorsally. As is the case in other Cypraeidae, the aperture of the shell is very narrow, and relatively long. Both the inner and outer lips are ornamented with arrays of small teeth. The dorsal side of the shell is convex or bent, and never depressed. The dorsal mantle groove (the line or area where the two mantle flaps meet when they are fully extended) is dissimilar to the shells general color pattern, and thus easily perceivable. The lateral margins are calloused, mainly towards both the posterior and anterior ends. The ventral side of the shell is typically flattened, and sometimes slightly concave. As is also the case in the shell of most other Cypraeidae snails, the shell surface is notably effulgent (shiny), as if it had been deliberately polished. The color is generally cream to light fawn dorsally, with shades of brown. The ventral side of the shell is colored cream to grey. The labral teeth are reddish brown and white towards the columella. The common name Arabian cowry is based on a dense and irregular pattern of thin longitudinal brown lines which are sometimes interrupted by empty spaces, giving an appearance that is considered to be similar to that of Arabic script. ==Distribution== Mauritia arabica is distributed widespread in the Indo-West Pacific, from East and South Africa (incluging Madagascar, but not the Red Sea nor the Persian Gulf), to the eastern Polynesia. It spreads north to Japan and south to New South Wales, Australia. ==Habitat== This sea snail dwells under boulder and stones, and also shelters in caverns of the outskirts of coral reefs. It lives in low intertidal zones to shallow sublittoral depths. Mauritia arabica is mainly active during the nocturnal period. ==Human uses== Mauritia arabica is collected for food by locals in many areas. The shell is commonly used in shellcraft. ==Gallery== File:Wyst-arabica.jpgA map of the distribution of Mauritia arabica File:Arabian Cowry1.jpgMauritia arabica in situ File:Cypraea arabica shell.jpgA shell of Mauritia arabica.

It was released in the United States on January 13, 2009 by Legacy Recordings. A European release followed on February 20, 2009. The album has received very positive reviews, and debuted at #19 on the Billboard Top 200 reached #1 on the blues chart, #1 on the Internet chart, and #4 on the Rock chart. This marks the band's highest debut on the Billboard Top 200 chart to date. The album won the 2010 Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Blues Album, marking the band's first Grammy award. The first single, \\"Down in the Flood\\", was released on November 4, 2008. Guest musicians include Doyle Bramhall II, Oteil Burbridge, Susan Tedeschi, and Eric Krasno (of Soulive). The song \\"Back Where I Started\\" was co-written by Trucks with fellow Allman Brothers Band guitarist Warren Haynes. == Trucks' thoughts on the album == Derek Trucks was interviewed by The Washington Post' upon the release of Already Free. The interviewer commented that in comparison to past albums by The Derek Trucks Band, this record reflects a more mature sound. Trucks himself responded by commenting that the album has a different feeling because in the past he always felt pressure to make a \\"guitar album\\". The difference, he maintains, is that the band has had more time to mature, and the album's sound is more balanced between the different contributions of its members, who developed its overall effect as they arranged the songs that were recorded for this album. == Track listing == # \\"Down in the Flood\\" (Dylan) ‚Äì 5:02 # \\"Something to Make You Happy\\" (Pena) ‚Äì 5:01 # \\"Maybe This Time\\" (feat.

Promoted to the first team after captaining the under-20 side in the 2008 Copa S√£o Paulo de Futebol J√∫nior by V√°gner Mancini, he was subsequently relegated back to the youth sides, as the manager complained about his attitude. Promoted back to the main squad in March 2008 by new manager Celso Roth, Rafael Carioca made his first team debut on 26 March, coming on as a substitute for Nunes in a 4‚Äì1 Campeonato Ga√∫cho away routing of 15 de Novembro. He made his S√©rie A debut on 10 May, starting in a 1‚Äì0 away win against S√£o Paulo, and finished the campaign as a first-choice in the central midfield, creating a strong partnership with William Magr√£o and appearing in 34 matches. ===Spartak Moscow=== In December 2008, Rafael Carioca joined Russian club FC Spartak Moscow on a five-year contract. He made his debut abroad on 15 March, starting in a 1‚Äì1 home draw against FC Zenit Saint Petersburg. Rafael Carioca spent the 2010 season on loan at Vasco da Gama, being an undisputed starter. Upon returning, he also became a first-choice, and scored his first professional goal on 6 May 2012, netting the winner in a 3‚Äì2 away defeat of Zenit. ===Atl√©tico Mineiro=== On 13 August 2014, Rafael Carioca returned to his home country after being presented at Atl√©tico Mineiro, agreeing to a year-long loan deal. Upon arriving, he became a first-choice player in Atl√©tico's team that went on to win that year's Copa do Brasil, overcoming longtime incumbent . Rafael Carioca had a solid start in the following season, which included an impressive goal against Colo-Colo in the Copa Libertadores and a Campeonato Mineiro win, again as a part of the team's starting eleven. On 21 July 2015, Atl√©tico bought 50% of Rafael Carioca's federative rights, agreeing to a permanent four-year deal. ===Tigres UANL=== On 25 August 2017, Rafael Carioca joined Liga MX club Tigres UANL. In his first season, he played the historical final against rivals C.F. Monterrey. In the first leg the teams tied by 1‚Äì1 at the Estadio Universitario. In the Estadio BBVA Bancomer, Tigres beat Monterrey by 2‚Äì1 with goals of Edu Vargas and Francisco Meza, as Rafael Carioca played a key role by assisting Meza with a cross from the right wing to score the second goal. ==International career== In 2007, Rafael Carioca captained the Brazil under-20 side and featured in the Sendai Cup for the under-18s in the same year, but was an unused substitute in the tournament. He received his first international call-up for the senior squad on 22 August 2016, for matches against Ecuador and Colombia. ==Career statistics== {  style=\\"text-align: center\\" - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Club !rowspan=\\"2\\"Season !colspan=\\"3\\"League !colspan=\\"2\\"State League !colspan=\\"2\\"Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"Continental !colspan=\\"2\\"Other !colspan=\\"2\\"Total - !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals - Gr√™mio 2008 S√©rie A 3402010colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äîcolspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî370 - rowspan=\\"7\\"Spartak Moscow 2009 rowspan=\\"6\\"Russian Premier League 230colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî10colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äîcolspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî240 - 2010‚Äì11 00colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî205Appearance(s) in UEFA Europa League0colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî70 - 2011‚Äì12 230colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî2020colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî270 - 2012‚Äì13 271colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî208Appearance(s) in UEFA Champions League1colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî372 - 2013‚Äì14 260colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî2020colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî300 - 2014‚Äì15 10colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî00colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äîcolspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî10 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !100!!1!!colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî!!9!!0!!17!!1!!colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî!!126!!2 - Vasco da Gama (loan) 2010 S√©rie A 34011070colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äîcolspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî520 - rowspan=\\"5\\"Atl√©tico Mineiro 2014 rowspan=\\"4\\"S√©rie A 90colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî30colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äîcolspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî120 - 2015 360131208Appearance(s) in Copa Libertadores1colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî592 - 2016 27111170911Appearance(s) in Primeira Liga0563 - 2017 180130307020430 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !90!!1!!37!!2!!15!!0!!24!!2!!3!!0!!169!!5 - rowspan=\\"3\\"UANL 2017‚Äì18 rowspan=\\"2\\"Liga MX 352colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî103Appearance(s) in CONCACAF Champions League0colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî392 - 2018‚Äì19 191colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî20colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî2One appearance in Campe√≥n de Campeones, one appearance in Campeones Cup0231 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !54!!3!!colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî!!3!!0!!3!!0!!2!!0!!62!!3 - !colspan=\\"3\\"Career total !312!!5!!50!!2!!35!!0!!44!!3!!5!!0!!446!!10 } ==HonoursClub=== Atl√©tico Mineiro * Copa do Brasil: 2014 * Campeonato Mineiro: 2015, 2017 UANL *Liga MX: Apertura 2017, Clausura 2019 *Campe√≥n de Campeones: 2018 *Campeones Cup: 2018 ===Individual=== *Campeonato Brasileiro S√©rie A Team of the Year: 2015 *CONCACAF Champions League Team of the Tournament: 2019 ==References * Category:1989 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Rio de Janeiro (city) Category:Brazilian footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:Campeonato Brasileiro S√©rie A players Category:Gr√™mio Foot-Ball Porto Alegrense players Category:CR Vasco da Gama players Category:Clube Atl√©tico Mineiro players Category:Russian Premier League players Category:FC Spartak Moscow players Category:Liga MX players Category:Tigres UANL footballers Category:Brazilian expatriate footballers Category:Brazilian expatriate sportspeople in Russia Category:Brazilian expatriates in Mexico Category:Expatriate footballers in Russia Category:Expatriate footballers in Mexico ","title":"Rafael Carioca"},{"id":"20200527","text":"Known in the gaming industry by their acronymic trademark BITS UK, this fan- owned game design company provided and continues to provide licensed product for the Traveller Role Playing Game.

It is sometimes called Swinging Doors and has also been released with two fewer songs as High On A Hilltop. ==Recording and composition== In April 1966, Haggard traveled to Nashville to record for the first time with disappointing results. \\"Seemed like there was a period where I was paddlin' around in the water tryin' to do something and it just wouldn't work,\\" Haggard recalls in the American Masters episode about his life, \\"and a lot of hair pullin' tryin' to figure out what I was doing wrong and what I could do right in order to make it work. And all of a sudden it just started workin'.\\" Focusing on the sharper edges that had made \\"Swinging Doors\\" a Top 5 hit, Haggard returned to the studio in late June 1966 and cut \\"The Bottle Let Me Down,\\" which would peak at number 3, his biggest hit up to that point. Haggard's new recordings largely centered on Roy Nichols's Telecaster, Ralph Mooney's steel guitar, and the harmony vocals provided by Bonnie Owens. As Owens recalled to Daniel Cooper in the liner notes to the Haggard box set Down Every Road, \\"The only person that either of us knew that had any success at all‚Äîthat we knew personally‚Äîwas Buck Owens. And so...we had to kind of pattern most everything from what Buck would talk to us about... Certain things, like...'The Bottle Let Me Down.' 'Tonight the bottle'‚Äîand he says 'let me down.' We were accenting what he's saying by himself... The only reason for harmony is to accent... Buck always taught me that.\\"Down Every Road 1962‚Äì1994 compilation album. Liner notes by Daniel Cooper Haggard and producer Ken Nelson also began employing session players like James Burton and Glen Campbell (who both played on \\"The Bottle Let Me Down\\") to help flesh out the tunes. During a marathon session on August 1, Haggard recorded \\"I'll Look Over You\\" and the Tommy Collins composition \\"High on a Hilltop,\\" which had been inspired by the foul language used by the waitresses at the Blackboard Cafe, a club where both Collins and Haggard had played. Liz Anderson, who had composed Haggard's first Top 10 hit \\"(My Friends Are Gonna Be) Strangers,\\" penned \\"This Town's Not Big Enough\\" but the majority of the songs were written by Haggard, who was becoming a prolific songwriter. ==Reception== Swinging Doors would top the Billboard country albums chart. AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote in his review: \\"In addition to the two masterpieces from which the album took its name, the record included a terrific version of Tommy Collins' \\"High On A Hilltop,\\" and plus excellent songs like \\"The Girl Turned Ripe,\\" \\"If I Could Be Him,\\" and \\"Someone Else You've Known.\\" There's a few weak tracks, but Haggard and his band are in fine form, making the filler enjoyable.\\" ==Track listing== All songs by Merle Haggard unless otherwise noted. #\\"Swinging Doors\\" ‚Äì 2:51 #\\"If I Could Be Him\\" ‚Äì 2:51 #\\"The Longer You Wait\\" ‚Äì 2:18 #\\"I'll Look Over You\\" ‚Äì 2:07 #\\"I Can't Stand Me\\" ‚Äì 2:16 #\\"The Girl Turned Ripe\\" ‚Äì 2:17 #\\"The Bottle Let Me Down\\" ‚Äì 2:45 #\\"No More You and Me\\" ‚Äì 2:18 #\\"Somebody Else You've Known\\" ‚Äì 2:07 #\\"High on a Hilltop\\" (Tommy Collins) ‚Äì 2:58 #\\"This Town's Not Big Enough\\" (Liz Anderson, Donna Austin) ‚Äì 2:43 #\\"Shade Tree (Fix-It-Man)\\" ‚Äì 2:20 ==Personnel== *Merle Haggard ‚Äì vocals, guitar The Strangers: *Roy Nichols ‚Äì guitar *Ralph Mooney ‚Äì steel guitar *George French ‚Äì piano *Jerry Ward ‚Äì bass *Eddie Burris ‚Äì drums with *Lewis Talley ‚Äì guitar *Billy Mize ‚Äì harmony vocals *Bonnie Owens ‚Äì harmony vocals and *James Burton ‚Äì guitar, dobro *Glen Campbell ‚Äì guitar *Phil Baugh ‚Äì guitar *Jack Collier ‚Äì guitar *Glen D.

Its specific epithet tigris relates to its common name \\"tiger\\" (the shell however is spotted, not striped). This species is the type species of the genus Cypraea. ==Subspecies and forms== * Cypraea tigris form incana Sulliotti, G.R., 1924 * Cypraea tigris form lyncicrosa Steadman, W.R. & B.C. Cotton, 1943 * Cypraea tigris var. schilderiana Cate, C.N., 1961 The variety Cypraea tigris var. schilderiana was recognized by Cate in 1961. It differs from Cypraea tigris in its large size (10-13 cm) and the lack of a thick marginal callus. This variety is found in the Hawaiian Islands, Johnston Island, and Vietnam.Kay E. A. 1961.

It measures up to 15 cm (6 in) in length, and the upper or dorsal side is white, pale bluish-white, or buff, densely covered with dark brown or blackish barely circular spots. Akin to many other Cypraea snails, the shells surface is notably effulgent, as if it were deliberately polished. There is sometimes a blurred red line along the length of the shell at the midline on the dorsal surface. The lower margins are rounded (that is, there is no sharp margin between the upper and lower surfaces of the shell as is found in some other cowries). The ventral side is white or whitish, and the shell opening is lined with tooth-like serrations. As is the case in almost all cypraeids, two lateral extensions of the mantle are able to extend so as to cover the shell completely, meeting at the midline of the dorsal surface. The mantle can also withdraw into the shell opening when threatened. In this species, the exterior surface of the mantle has numerous pin-like projections that are white-tipped. ==Distribution and habitat== The tiger cowrie is found on the ocean floor in the Indo-Pacific region, from the eastern coast of Africa to the waters of Micronesia and Polynesia, the Coral Sea and around the Philippines. Along the Australian Coast it is found from northern New South Wales to northern Western Australia, as well as Lord Howe Island, and along the east coast of Africa including Madagascar. Found between depths of 10 and 40 metres (35-130 ft), it is often associated with live coral colonies, such as the table-forming Acropora,(file created 1 April) 2009. Singapore Red Data Book 2008 . Accessed 6 September 2009. either found on the reefs themselves or the sandy sea bottom nearby. Once common, it is now much less abundant due to shell collecting and the destruction of its habitat by such processes as dynamite fishing, especially in shallower areas. Carnivorous, the adult tiger cowrie eats coral and various invertebrates, while juveniles eat algae. This species is endangered in Singapore. ==Human use== cameo cut into the shell of a Cypraea tigris Despite the fact that this species does not occur in the Mediterranean Sea, shells of the tiger cowrie and the related panther cowrie, Cypraea pantherina, have been unearthed at Pompeii, the ancient Roman city near Naples, Italy, where these shells may have been used as some form of ornament. It is also conceivable that the shells were part of a natural history collection. There was an interest in natural history at the time, as exemplified by Pliny the Elder who wrote extensively about seashells in his book Natural History and who died investigating the eruption of Vesuvius. The shells of this species of cowry are still popular among shell collectors, and are also used as a decorative object, even in modern times. The shell of Cypraea tigris is believed to help to facilitate childbirth: some women in Japan hold a shell of this species during childbirth. Large cowry shells such as that of this species were used in Europe in the recent past as a frame over which sock heels were stretched for darning, i.e. instead of using a darning egg. The cowry's smooth surface allows the darning needle to be positioned under the cloth more easily than when using a darning mushroom made of wood. ==Gallery== File:Cypraea tigris.jpgA live individual of Cypraea tigris viewed from the posterior end; note the mantle partly covering the shell.

It became an Internet phenomenon. There have been seven further litters. ==Background== The live webcam was set up on Ustream in October 2008 by a San Francisco, California, couple to monitor their Shiba Inu puppies while they were at work. The live streaming website showed the puppies interacting with each other in a variety of ways: sleeping, playing with toys, tearing up wee pads, and snuggling with their mother, Kika. Links to the site spread virally. By October 13, 2008, three million viewers had spent 1.2 million hours watching the puppies via the Internet. the Shiba Inu Puppy Cam streaming page on Ustream has received over 60 million views. The six puppies (three females: Autumn, Ayumi, and Amaya and three males: Aki, Akoni, and Ando) were identified mainly by their different- colored collars. The collars associated with the pups of the A-Team are: Autumn (purple collar); Ayumi (yellow collar); Amaya (red collar); Aki (green collar); Akoni (black collar); and Ando (blue collar).This litter became known as \\"The Shiba Six\\" as well as \\"The A-Team\\", referring to the fact that they were Kika's first litter. The sire was a dog called Ch Jogoso's Notorious. The list of countries from which people watched the live webcast of the puppy cam from all around the globe grew to 74 countries in total with this first litter. By December 7, 2008, Autumn, Akoni, and Ando had been adopted by new owners. Two other pups, Aki and Amaya, went to their new homes later that month around December. The couple kept one pup from this litter, Ayumi, and the camera continued functioning so that viewers were able to watch her interact with the other three adult Shibas in the house. The dogs' owners remain anonymous. ==Second litter: B-Team== Kika's second litter of puppies were born on January 16, 2010. They are referred to as the \\"B-team\\" of puppies to mark the 2nd litter. Their father was a red dog named GCH Morningstar's Dances With Wolves. There were a total of two female and three male Shibas. Two of the three males are cream-colored, the rest of the pups red. The puppies in birth order are the girls: Bella and Beni-Bara, and the boys: Bonsai, Bento (cream), and Byakko (cream). By March 21, 2010, all five puppies of the second litter were adopted. ==Third litter: C-Team== On April 14, 2011, over fifteen hundred viewers tuned in to see Kika's third and final litter. As in the original litter there are six puppies, three of each sex. Unlike the previous two litters, the \\"C-Team\\" sire was a black-and-tan Shiba (a Japanese- born dog by the name of Kurosuzutama Go Aomori Sakaesou); however, despite the sire's color, all the puppies are red. The C-Team puppies are, in order of birth: Chozen, aka \\"Zen\\" (boy); Chame (boy); Chisaki, aka \\"Saki\\" (girl); Charlotte (girl); Chiyoko, aka \\"Yo-Yo\\" (girl); and Chikara (boy). The last boy pup, Chikara, has the highest birth weight of any of the pups at 11 ounces. ==Fourth litter: D-Team== The fourth litter of puppies was born on May 21, 2012, to Ayumi (who was retained from the \\"A-Team\\" litter). They were sired by a red Shiba named GCH CH Kobushi Justa Draco Rosso AOM. They are referred to as the \\"D-team\\" of puppies to mark the 4th litter. There were a total of three female and two male Shiba puppies. One of the three females is cream-colored; the rest are red. The names of the D-Team are as follows: Daiichi (boy, blue collar); Dango (boy, green collar); Dosha (girl, pink collar); Daisuki (girl, purple collar); and Dakota (girl, no collar, cream). ==Fifth litter: E-Team== The fifth litter of puppies was born on August 21, 2013 to parents Ayumi and sire Morningstar Dr McDreamy Chouseisou. This was the second and final litter born to Ayumi (who herself was from the \\"A-Team\\" litter). They are referred to as the \\"E-team\\" of puppies to mark the 5th litter. There were a total of three red female puppies (Eiko, pink collar; Eisha, purple collar; and Ember, red collar) and two cream-colored males (Enoki, green collar; and Edo, blue collar). ==Sixth litter: F-Team== The sixth litter of puppies was born on November 10, 2015, born to Chiyoko (aka Yo-Yo) from the \\"C-Team\\" litter, and Hiro, an AKC/UKC/NIPPO-USA Champion male Shiba imported by the family from Japan in 2013. This litter of pups are referred to as the \\"F-team\\" to mark the 6th litter that the couple have raised in their home. The litter had five pups in total; four female and one male. There were 3 red pups and 2 black and tan pups born. The names of the F-Team, in order of birth, are as follows: Fuyuka (female, pink collar); Fumiyo (female, purple collar); Fate (female, red collar); Fuji (male, blue collar); and Fusami (female, green collar). Fate and Fuji are the black-and-tan colored pups from the litter. All the other puppies went to new homes as family pets in mid-late January 2016 with the exception of Fuji, the black-and-tan puppy. == New Pup: Nori == A new black-and-tan female pup was added to the household at the end of September 2016 and given the name of Minori with the call name of \\"Nori\\". It is believed that this female will enter the AKC dog show circuit and possibly be the couple's new foundation girl moving forward once all appropriate health tests have been verified. == Seventh litter: G-Team == The seventh litter of puppies was born on December 13, 2018 to parents Nori and Hiro. This litter of pups are referred to as the \\"G-Team\\" to mark the 7th litter that the couple have raised, and the first in their new home. On another first, this is both Nori's first litter and will also mark a new lineage in the household as Nori is not related to Kika, the Shiba girl who is the mother of the first litter of Shiba Inu Puppy Cam pups. The \\"G-Team\\" consists of two pups, both girls with one being red colored, named Garnet, and the other being black-and-tan colored, named Genki. == Eighth litter: H-Team == The eighth litter of puppies was born on December 19, 2019. Three puppies were born, each a different color, one red named Haiku, one cream named Holly, and one black and tan named Hime. ==Fundraising efforts== The owners created a calendar in 2009 showing the various pups from the first litter on each month. Shortly afterward they created a mousepad and a number of greeting cards, which also featured images of the pups. Donations from the calendar are being sent to various Shiba Inu Rescue organizations around the United States, and that year the amount totaled over $6,000.Shiba Inu Puppy Cam In their 2010 calendar, the couple included their other Shibas, Yuuki (the eldest, a red female) and Haru (black and tan male) as well as pictures of the now adult Shiba Six, courtesy of their owners. As with the previous year's calendar, proceeds from the sale were donated to Shiba Inu rescue organizations around the US. From April to November 2009, regular viewers of the Puppy Cam (who call themselves Shibaholics) collectively donated $11,172 to Shiba Inu Rescue Resources of America in honor of the SFShiba family. The Summer 2009 issue of the Shiba E-News had an article on the Puppy Cam and the fundraising efforts of its followers on behalf of the Shiba rescue organizations supported by SIRRA.

In an article announcing the adoption of the World Charter, the United Press International reported: \\"Women from the world's oldest profession, some wearing exotic masks to protect their identity, appealed Friday at the world's first international prostitutes' convention for society to stop treating them like criminals.\\" ==The text== LawsInternational Committee for Prostitutes' Rights (ICPR), Amsterdam 1985, Published in Pheterson, G (ed.), A Vindication of the Rights of Whores. Seattle: Seal Press, 1989. (p.40) * Decriminalize all aspects of adult prostitution resulting from individual decision. * Decriminalize prostitution and regulate third parties according to standard business codes. Existing standard business codes allow abuse of prostitutes. Therefore special clauses must be included to prevent the abuse and stigmatization of prostitutes (self-employed and others). * Enforce criminal laws against fraud, coercion, violence, child sexual abuse, child labor, rape, racism everywhere and across national boundaries, whether or not in the context of prostitution. * Eradicate laws that can be interpreted to deny freedom of association, or freedom to travel, to prostitutes within and between countries. Prostitutes have rights to a private life. Human Rights * Guarantee prostitutes all human rights and civil liberties, including the freedom of speech, travel, immigration, work, marriage, and motherhood and the right to unemployment insurance, health insurance and housing. * Grant asylum to anyone denied human rights on the basis of a \\"crime of status,\\" be it prostitution or homosexuality. Working Conditions * There should be no law which implies systematic zoning of prostitution. Prostitutes should have the freedom to choose their place of work and residence. It is essential that prostitutes can provide their services under the conditions that are absolutely determined by themselves and no one else. * There should be a committee to insure the protection of the rights of the prostitutes and to whom prostitutes can address their complaints. This committee must be prostitutes and other professionals like lawyers and supporters. * There should be no law discriminating against prostitutes associating and working collectively in order to acquire a high degree of personal security. Health * All women and men should be educated to periodical health screening for sexually transmitted diseases. Since health checks have historically been used to control and stigmatize prostitutes, and since adult prostitutes are generally even more aware of sexual health than others, mandatory checks for prostitutes are unacceptable unless they are mandatory for all sexually active people. Services * Employment, counseling, legal, and housing services for runaway children should be funded in order to prevent child prostitution and to promote child well-being and opportunity. * Prostitutes must have the same social benefits as all other citizens according to the different regulations in different countries. * Shelters and services for working prostitutes and re-training programs for prostitutes wishing to leave the life should be funded. Taxes * No special taxes should be levied on prostitutes or prostitute businesses. * Prostitutes should pay regular taxes on the same basis as other independent contractors and employees, and should receive the same benefits. Public Opinion * Support educational programs to change social attitudes which stigmatize and discriminate against prostitutes and ex-prostitutes of any race, gender or nationality. * Develop educational programs which help the public to understand that the customer plays a crucial role in the prostitution phenomenon, this role being generally ignored. The customer, like the prostitute, should not, however, be criminalized or condemned on a moral basis. * We are in solidarity with workers in the sex industry. Organization * Organizations of prostitutes and ex-prostitutes should be supported to further implementation of the above charter. ==Development of a human rights approach== The World Charter emerged from the prostitutes' rights movement starting in the mid-1970s. It was established through the two World Whores Congresses held in Amsterdam (1985) and Brussels (1986) which epitomised a worldwide prostitutes' rights movement and politics. The Charter established a human rights based approach which has subsequently been further elaborated by the prostitutes' rights movement. In 1999, the Santa Monica Mirror commented on the popularization of the term \\"sex worker\\" as an alternative to \\"whore\\" or \\"prostitute\\" and credited the World Charter, among others, for having \\"articulated a global political movement seeking recognition and social change.\\" In 2000, the Carnegie Council published a report commenting on the results of the World Charter, fifteen years after its adoption. The report concluded that the human rights approach embodied in the World Charter had proved \\"extremely useful for advocates seeking to reduce discrimination against sex workers.\\" For example, human rights advocates in Australia utilized the language of human rights to resist ‚Äúmandatory health tests‚Äù for sex workers and to require that information regarding health be kept confidential. However, the report also found that efforts to define prostitution as a human rights abuse had led some governments to take action to abolish the sex industry. And in 2003, a writer in the journal \\"Humanist\\" noted that the World Charter had become \\"a template used by human rights groups all over the world.\\" ==Opposition== The World Charter was initially met with scepticism and ridicule. Time reported: \\"Just what were all those hookers doing in the hallowed halls of the European Parliament in Brussels last week? The moral outrage echoing in the corridors may have suggested that a re- creation of Sodom and Gomorrah was being staged. Reason: about 125 prostitutes, including three men, were attending the Second World Whores Congress.\\" The Philadelphia Daily News asked, \\"Does it contain a layoff clause?\\" Another writer referred to it derisively as \\"a Magna Carta for whores\\". The Charter remains controversial, as some feminists consider prostitution to be one of the most serious problems facing women, particularly in developing countries. In Jessica Spector's 2006 book Prostitution and Pornography, Vednita Carter and Evelina Giobbe offer the following critique of the Charter: > \\"Pretending prostitution is a job like any other job would be laughable if > it weren't so serious. Leading marginalized prostituted women to believe > that decriminalization would materially change anything substantive in their > lives as prostitutes is dangerous and irresponsible. There are no liberating > clauses in the World Charter. Pimps are not 'third party managers.'\\" == See also == *A Vindication of the Rights of Whores *COYOTE *Decriminalizing sex work *International Day to End Violence Against Sex Workers *Margo St. James *Sex worker rights *Sex worker == References == Category:Sex workers' rights ","title":"World Charter for Prostitutes' Rights"},{"id":"20200644","text":"William Middleton Grant (born 14 November 1904, date of death 24 September 1994) was a Scottish professional footballer.

According to The Smithsonian Collection of Classic Country Music, Haggard wrote \\"Hungry Eyes\\" as a tribute to his mother and the sacrifices she made for her family as a single mother (Haggard's father having died when he was 9), but it also stands as a tribute to Oklahomans and others who lived in labor camps during the Great Depression, Haggard's way of \\"commemorating a whole generation of Okies who persisted through persecution and suffering to transplant their culture to California.\\"The Smithsonian Collection of Classic Country Music compilation album. Liner notes by Bill C. Malone \\"Hungry Eyes\\" is considered by many to be one of Haggard's greatest pieces of songwriting. According to Daniel Cooper's essay for the 1994 Haggard box set Down Every Road, Haggard had been carrying the title around in his head for two years before deciding what to do with it, and the \\"canvass-covered cabin\\" referred to in the song is a direct reference to the home of Escar and Willie, the great-uncle and great-aunt with whom he stayed after his father died. In the documentary Beyond Nashville, Haggard explains, \\"'Mama's Hungry Eyes' was written about a period in America where there were places like labor camps, and the people in these labor camps that weren't ignorant and they weren't a lot of things Steinbeck thought they were.\\" The song would also serve as the title to the 1994 tribute album Mama's Hungry Eyes: A Tribute to Merle Haggard. The album's other number-one hit is \\"Workin' Man Blues\\", referencing blue collar pride, an oft-used subject of Haggard's songwriting. In his 2013 book The Running Kind, David Cantwell praises the contributions of guitarists James Burton and Roy Nichols, as well as session bassist Chuck Berghofer, stating, \\"Burton and the Strangers had ridden a kindred rocking guitar groove on 1968's 'I'm Bringing Home Good News,' but 'Workin' Man Blues' sets the standard.\\" Lines such as \\"I ain't never been on welfare, and that's one place I won't be\\" reinforced Haggard's status as \\"Poet of the Common Man.\\" Haggard wrote four of the LP's ten songs himself, including the mournful \\"Silver Wings\\" which, much like his earlier composition \\"Today I Started Loving You Again,\\" was never released as a single but became immensely popular with audiences. A Portrait of Merle Haggard includes four songs penned by Haggard as well as compositions by Willie Nelson, Leon Payne and Hank Cochran. ==Reception== The album rose to number 3 on the Billboard country albums chart. Mark Deming of AllMusic: \\"Three of Haggard's finest songs appear on this set‚Äî'Silver Wings,' 'Hungry Eyes,' and 'Workin' Man's Blues'‚Äîand most country artists would be happy to cut three tunes this strong during the course of their career, let alone as part of one of six albums Hag would release in 1969... The production and arrangements are admirably low-key and to the point, and Haggard's vocals are deeply emotive without overplaying his hand.\\" ==Track listing== #\\"Workin' Man Blues\\" (Merle Haggard) #\\"What's Wrong With Stayin' Home\\" (Bob Morris) #\\"Silver Wings\\" (Haggard) #\\"Who Do I Know in Dallas\\" (Hank Cochran , Willie Nelson) #\\"She Thinks I Still Care\\" (Dickey Lee, Steve Duffy) #\\"Hungry Eyes\\" (Haggard) #\\"I Die Ten Thousand Times a Day\\" (Leon Payne) #\\"Every Fool Has a Rainbow\\" (Haggard) #\\"I Came So Close to Losing My Home\\" (Jimmie Davis, Ken Hunt) #\\"Montego Bay\\" (Cochran, Glenn Martin) ==Personnel== *Merle Haggard‚Äì vocals, guitar The Strangers: *Roy Nichols ‚Äì guitar, harmonica *Norman Hamlet ‚Äì steel guitar *George French ‚Äì piano *Jerry Ward ‚Äì bass *Eddie Burris ‚Äì drums with *Lewis Talley ‚Äì guitar *Tommy Collins‚Äì guitar *Billy Mize ‚Äì harmony vocals *Bonnie Owens ‚Äì harmony vocals and *James Burton ‚Äì guitar, dobro *Glen D.

The Raitt's sand eel is member of the family Ammodytidae which includes all 31 species of sand eels, often referred to as sand lances. Contrary to their name sand eels, including Raitt's sand eel, are not true eels and instead belong to the order of ‚Äúweever-like‚Äù fishes, the Trachiniformes. ==Description== The Raitt's sand eel is a small elongated fish that is usually about 20 cm long. The maximum length reported for this species of sand eel is 25 cm. They are silver all over with darker scales on their dorsal side. Raitt's sand eels have a short tail fin that is deeply forked. They have a long and low dorsal fin that is twice as long as the tail fin and runs along almost the entire body. The scales on their underside are arranged randomly instead of in a distinct pattern as in many other fish. The Raitt's sand eel has a pointed jaw where the lower jaw projects further than the upper jaw. It is difficult to distinguish this species from the other members in its genus ‚Äò‚ÄôAmmodytes‚Äô‚Äô as they are all very similar in appearance. ==Evolution== The evolutionary history of the Raitt's sand eel is still debated and its exact relationship to the other members of its order Perciformes is unknown. There is currently no universally accepted phylogeny for the Raitt's sand eel's suborder the Trachinoidei. ==Distribution and habitat== The Raitt's sand eel is found across the Northeast Atlantic Ocean and is particularly abundant in the North Sea. They live in both the shallow open ocean and coastal waters. Four other species of sand eel are also distributed in this part of the Atlantic. The fisheries here are dominated by Raitt's sand eel suggesting the Raitt's sand eel is the most abundant in the area. The southern boundary of the Raitt's sand eel is predicted to move further North in the future due to climate change. The Raitt's sand eel survives better in cooler waters and may move North to avoid warming sea temperatures. Sand eels live amongst sandy sediment of the sea bed where they spend most the year burrowed avoiding predators. They are also found living in bedrock and kelp habitats. Sandbanks are the most important habitat for the sand eel as they are used as nursery, spawning and resting grounds. Raitt's sand eels live in turbulent areas of the ocean and do not live in depths below 100m. Raitt's sand eel have very specific habitat requirements. They are specialised to live in waters high in oxygen but with low levels of silt and clay. These requirements mean the Raitt's sand eel is found in distinct patches across the North Atlantic and instead of one continuous population. ==Population== Due to their lifestyle, it has been very difficult to estimate the population size of the Raitt's sand eel. Most monitoring techniques are inappropriate and cannot detect the burrowed sand eels. A black-legged kittiwake flying above the sea Biological indicators, or bioindicators, are now being used to assess the size of the Raitt's sand eel population. The main indicator used for sand eels are black-legged kittiwake seabirds. These coastal breeding birds are heavily reliant on sand eels and therefore their population size changes in response to the amount of Raitt's sand eel present. This can give a lot of information about the abundance of sand eels in the area. The Raitt's sand eel is known from fishing records to have regular population fluctuations. Overfishing, climate change and food web effects have all been shown to have contribute to these fluctuations. As the Raitt's sand eel is found in the North Atlantic Ocean its climate is altered by the North Atlantic Oscillation. This weather fluctuation can alter the recruitment of sand eel. Warmer temperatures decrease the number of sand eel juveniles that survive to adulthood and so yearly changes to temperature can cause fluctuating population size. Changes to the abundance of species connected to the Raitt's sand eel in the food web has also caused variable population size. Calanus copepods are an important prey item for sand eels. The population of Raitt's sand eel has been related to changes in the availability of this prey. Young Raitt's sand eels have lower survival when copepods are less abundant. ==Ecology== The Raitt's sand eel is a keystone species in the North Sea food web. They are the prey of a significant number of species including seabirds, marine mammals and larger fish. Seabirds in particular rely heavily on the Raitt's sand eel to feed their chicks. When the sand eels leave their burrows to feed seabirds dive into the water to catch them and then return to their nests. Atlantic puffin, black-legged kittiwake, common guillemot and razorbills are all known predators of this species. Common guillemots feed exclusively on Raitt's sand eel during the breeding season. In the sea many larger fish species prey on the Raitt's sand eel including cod, haddock, whiting, saithe and mackerel. Many of these are very commercially valuable species and declines in sand eel have caused declines in their numbers due to lack of prey. Marine mammals also feed on Raitt's sand eels but less regularly. Mostly species such as grey seals, harbour seals and harbour porpoise consume many sand eels in the spring and early summer. Raitt's sand eels feed mainly on zooplankton. By consuming zooplankton they act as a link through to the higher trophic level predators that eat sand eels. ===Behaviour=== Sand eel species switch between open water swimming and burying themselves in the sand to avoid nearby predators. When they are not burrowed they live in shoal formations. They spend most of the winter burrowed in the sediment but then enter the open water between March and June to feed as the abundance of prey increases. Even in the summer months when Raitt's sand eels emerge to feed they still burrow in the sand in the night. ===Life cycle=== Raitt's sand eels breed in December and January when they briefly leave their winter burrows in the sediment. They lay their eggs in the sand which incubate there until they hatch in February and March. The hatched sand eels live in the open water above the sediment until metamorphosis. After this, they return to burrow in the sediment. Most Raitt's sand eels live for only 3 or 4 years as they have a high level of natural death. ==Commercial uses== An open water aquaculture fish farm All species of sand eels are used extensively in the fish oil and fishmeal industries. Their bodies are rich in lipids which makes them an ideal fish for these purposes. The demand for fishmeal has increased with the rise of aquaculture over the last few decades. Global production of farmed fish doubled between 1985-2000 and this created huge demands for fishmeal to feed the farmed fish. Raitt's sand eel alongside capelin and Norway pout are the primary species used for this purpose. Sand eels have been fished since the 1950s. However, this was not done for industrial purposes until the 1970s when the fishing fleet for sand eel increased rapidly. The Raitt's sand eel is the most abundant species of sand eel in these fisheries and makes up over 90% of the catch. In 1977 the sand eel fishery became the largest fishery in the North Sea, with landings regularly exceeding 1 million tonnes. This high level of fishing caused a decline in stocks over time as the fishery became unsustainable. This led to both financial losses for the fishing industry and negative environmental consequences. Raitt's sand eel fisheries are difficult to manage due to lack of population size data and regular population fluctuations. No catch predictions can be made for the fishery due to its instability. ===Environmental concerns=== Sand eel fisheries produce a lot of bycatch due to the techniques used to collect them. The netting used has a very small mesh size in order to catch the small Raitt's sand eel and larger species get caught in them. Common guillemot seabirds have repeatedly been found caught and killed in these nets and this has sparked concerns over the negative impacts of the fishery on the environment. Fisheries of sand eel can also be harmful to seabird colonies. Fishing the Raitt's sand eel means there are less available to be eaten by the seabirds. Populations of Atlantic puffin and black-legged kittiwake have declined in response to decreased prey levels of sand eel in the sea. ===Fishery closure=== An Atlantic puffin flying with sand eel in beak As a result of overfishing of the Raitt's sand eel the sand eel fishery in the North Sea off the coast of Scotland was closed down in 2000. An observed decline in Atlantic puffins was linked to reduced numbers of sand eel prey and the fishery was closed in the hope to recover the puffin population. After the closure the numbers of Raitt's sand eel increased and benefited many top predators including the black-legged kittiwake. The fishery continues to be closed except for a small area carefully managed to make assessments of the sand eel stock. These previous problems with Raitt's sand eel fisheries and the concerns for seabirds, commercially valuable fish and marine mammals have led to calls for better management and monitoring of sand eel abundance. ===Controversy=== The impacts of intense Raitt's sand eel fishing has been debated. Census data has shown that seabird populations as a whole are not negatively impacted by sand eel fisheries. Some has suggested that the observed declines in seabirds such as puffins were isolated incidences that do not represent the whole population. ==Conservation status== The Raitt's sand eel is currently not assessed by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. ==References== Category:Ammodytidae Category:Fish of the Atlantic Ocean Category:Fish of the Baltic Sea Category:Fish of the North Sea Category:Fish described in 1934 ","title":"Raitt's sand eel"},{"id":"20200910","text":"Das Echo is a monthly German language newspaper based in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.Alexander Freund. Beyond the Nation?: Immigrants' Local Lives in Transnational Cultures. University of Toronto Press; 30 October 2012. . p. 176. ==History== Das Echo began as the Das Echo des Deutschen Hauses f√ºr die deutsch-kanadische Gemeinschaft, founded by Paul Christian Walter in 1978. It first began printing as a quarterly newssheet for the German community in Greater Montreal. Like the majority of newspapers in Germany, it is a subscriber's publication with a comparably small number of freely sold issues. Das Echo and the Deutsche Rundschau are the only newspapers by an ethnic minority (German) in Canada to have stringers in most Canadian provinces and many European countries. Das Echo faced the delocalisation of its readers from Montreal and the rest of Quebec to other Canadian provinces. Like their English speaking neighbours, many German speaking Quebeckers left the province because of the political turmoil and changes that followed the Quiet Revolution. In 1979 Walter turned the news sheet into a bimonthly newspaper and two years later it became a monthly newspaper, reporting about the activities of and covering information for the German-speaking communities in the Canadian provinces. In 1982 the title was finally shortened to Das Echo featuring the subtitle von K√ºste zu K√ºste, meaning from coast to coast. From 1984 to 1995 Das Echo experienced a period of extensive growth, exceeding a circulation of 80,000. Das Echo has usually been an ethnic press newspaper, but established itself as an independent source of information in central European affairs in North America. Since the mid 90s Das Echo has earned a steadily growing number of subscriptions from the United States. A substantial loss of subscriptions during the late 1990s and early years of the new millennium forced the Walter family into restructuring to avoid a financial collapse; the result was more advertising in the newspaper in order to keep a low retail price. On the other hand, the editorial staff was required to reorient the central theme of traditional German Canadian affairs, to reinforce its distinguishing character as German Canadian newspaper.Marianne Franch√©o. Langage et pouvoir en interaction: √©tude de quelques exemples. ENS Editions; 1995. . p. 165. In about 2006 Das Echo started recovering subscription numbers. The newspaper currently has an average monthly readership of about 100,000. The paper remains one of the largest nationwide German language newspaper in Canada and the United States. Its largest regional readership can be found in the Canadian prairie provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba. In 2012 Das Echo received the award of the National Ethnic Press and Media Council of Canada. Das Echo is member of the globally active IMH network, the International Association of German Media (IDM), the National Ethnic Press & Media Council of Canada, dpa, APA, SDA and swissinfo. ==See also== *List of newspapers in Canada ==References * Category:1978 establishments in Quebec Category:German-Canadian culture Category:Multicultural and ethnic newspapers published in Canada Category:Monthly newspapers Category:Newspapers published in Montreal Category:Publications established in 1978 Category:German-language newspapers published in Canada ","title":"Das Echo"},{"id":"20200912","text":"Hans J√°kupsson Debes (1723‚Äì1769) was Lawman of the Faroe Islands from 1752 to 1769.

He was also the father of Moon Sung-keun, a noted actor in South Korea. ==Early life and education== He was born as the first son of the Reverend, Moon Jae-rin and mother, Shin Sin-muk. He had two brothers and two sisters. He and his brother became pastors. He was raised in Bukgando where Korean independence movement was centered. After finishing up education at Myeongdong Elementary school and Eunjin Middle school that ethnic Koreans established, Moon went to Sungsil Middle School in Pyongyang, and then Yongjeong Gwangmyeong School in Bukgando. Although Moon Ik-hwan entered Tokyo Union Theological Seminary in Japan, he was dismissed from the school because of his refusal to enlist himself to Japanese army. He then transferred to Bongcheon Seminary (Î¥âÏ≤úÏã†ÌïôÍµê) in Manchuria and served as a preacher at a Korean church. In 1947, he graduated Hansin University and received the imposition of hands. After he earned his master's degree from Princeton Theological Seminary in the United States, he returned to South Korea and began to lecture the Old Testament at Yonsei University and Hanshin University. Later, he worked on translating the Old Testament until he devoted himself on unification of two Koreas and democracy of South Korea. ==Career== Moon worked as the main chief for the translation on the Old Testament by a joint collaboration of the Protestant and Catholic church in South Korea for 8 years. Moon was imprisoned in 1976 for dissident activities and again in 1986 for his alleged encouragement of student activists at Seoul National University and his leadership in the protest at Inch'on in May of that year.Donald Stone Macdonald \\"The Koreans: Contemporary Politics and Society\\"; 3rd ed. \\"Society and Culture\\". 1996 p. 102.

He was the son of Virius Nicomachus Flavianus. He held several offices under emperors Valentinian II (371‚Äì392), Theodosius I (379‚Äì395), Honorius (393‚Äì423), and Valentinian III (425‚Äì455); together with his father he supported the usurper Eugenius until his defeat and death (392‚Äì394). Flavianus also edited a corrected version of Livy's work. == Biography == Symmachi‚ÄìNicomachi diptych; the left leaf is at the Mus√©e National du Moyen √Çge, Paris, the right leaf is at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Flavianus belonged to the Nicomachi, an influential family of senatorial rank. His father was the pagan politician and historian Virius Nicomachus Flavianus,CIL, VI, 1783 and he had a brother.Symmachus, Epistulae, ii.17,88, vi.12,20. He married a daughter (who some sources say was called Galla and other sources say is unnamed) of Quintus Aurelius Symmachus, from whom he received over 80 letters,Symmachus, Epistulae, vi.1‚Äì81. and whose family had a long-time friendship and alliance with the Nicomachi. It may have been in occasion of Flavianus' wedding that the \\"Nicomachorum-Symmachorum\\" diptych was produced.Serena Ensoli, Eugenio La Rocca, Aurea Roma. Dalla citt√† pagana alla citt√† cristiana, L'ERMA di BRETSCHNEIDER, 2000, , p. 467. Alternatively, it may have been produced on the occasion of the wedding of Galla, daughter of Nicomachus Flavianus and his unnamed wife, with the son of Symmachus. As was traditional for his family, he was patron of Naples;D 8985. and, sharing a common interest in his family, he edited works of pagan authors of the Roman literature: in particular, around 408 he produced a corrected edition of the first ten books of the Ab Urbe condita of Livy,Codex Mediceus. A first subscription is at the end of book 6, in which Flavianus, who styles himself \\"three times prefect\\", claims to have corrected the book; a second subscription is at the end of book 7, where Flavianus adds that he corrected at Enna; the last subscription is at the end of book 8, where he refers he edited the book, while staying at Thermae (Charles W. Hedrick, History and Silence: Purge and Rehabilitation of Memory in Late Antiquity, University of Texas Press, 2000, , p. 181-182). while he was staying near Enna (he had estates in Sicily).Symmachus, Epistulae, ii.30, vi.57,66. His edition had been corrected by Victorinus before him, then bought by Symmachus, and finally, after Flavianus' edition, emended another time by his nephew Appius Nicomachus Dexter; all of the manuscripts of the first ten books of Livy's Ab Urbe condita that were subsequently copied through the Middle Ages into modern times are derived by this single manuscript, thanks to whom those books have survived.Charles W. Hedrick, History and Silence: Purge and Rehabilitation of Memory in Late Antiquity, University of Texas Press, 2000, , p. 181-182 His political career is reported on an inscription (CIL, VI, 1783). His first office was consularis Campaniae, that is governor of the region of Campania, a position held at a date unknown, but before the following office, the one of proconsul Asiae (382‚Äì383), governor of Asia Minor. His father delayed his departure for his province;Symmachus, Epistulae, ii.22. in this office he was the addressee of some laws later included in the Codex Theodosianus,Codex Theodosianus, vii.18.8, ix.29.2 while Himerius dedicated in his honour three orations.Himerius, Orationes, xii, xxxvi,xliii. He clubbed a decurion, and for this reason was dismissed from his office, taking a ship to go home.Libanius, Orationes, xxviii. He was later recalled at court by Theodosius I, when the emperor was in Italy (389/391), but he did not receive any office. After the death of Valentinian II, Eugenius usurped the throne of the Western part of the empire; both father and son sided with the usurper, and Flavianus iunior became praefectus urbi of Rome. After the defeat and death of Eugenius at the battle of the Frigidus (September 394), Flavianus senior committed suicide, while Flavianus iunior received no harm from his support to the usurper, apart having to repay his father's wages as praetorian prefect.Symmachus, Epistulae, iv.19, iv.51, v.47, vi.12; Augustine, Civitas Dei, v.26. He received several letters from his father-in-law Quintus Aurelius Symmachus, a close and influential friend of his father, to suggest him to take part to the senatorial delegation to the emperor (397), in order to rehabilitate himself, but it is probable he did not follow Symmachus' suggestions.Symmachus, Epistulae, vi.52, 56, 59, 63. However he was invited in late 398 to the celebrations for the inauguration of the Emperor as consul for 399.Symmachus, Epistulae, iv.6.39, v.6, vi.10,30,35,36, vii.47,95,102, ix.47. He was twice appointed praefectus urbi of Rome, first between 399‚Äì400Symmachus, Epistulae, vii.104. and then again in 408.Codex Theodosianus, ii.15.2. The total number of prefectures was officially two, as the office held under Eugenius was not recognized, but one inscription refers vaguely to the number of terms, and on his edition of Livius' work there is a note referring to three prefectures. In 414 was sent to Africa together with Caecilianus to investigate a matter.Codex Theodosianus, xi.1.36, vi.23.3. In 431‚Äì432 he was praetorian prefect of Italia, Illyricum and Africa. == Notes  Bibliography == ;Primary sources * Augustine of Hippo, Civitas Dei * Codex Theodosianus * Himerius, Orationes * Libanius, Orationes * Quintus Aurelius Symmachus, Epistulae ;Secondary sources * Arnold Hugh Martin Jones, John Robert Martindale, J.

She was taken over by the United States for World War I on 12 June 1917, transferred to United States Shipping Board ownership, renamed Itasca and assigned to United States Army service. Although she operated as a U.S. cargo transport with a U.S. Navy crew, there is no record of her commissioning. Her name was changed to Honolulu on 26 July 1918.This may reflect a commissioning date; many U.S. Navy World War I cargo ships were commissioned in 1918 after 1917‚Äì1918 U.S. Army service, and a commissioning date is a logical date on which her name would change. Honolulus service included cargo cruises between the United States and various French ports. U.S. Navy personnel were released from the ship in March 1919This may reflect her decommissioning, as that is a logical time for U.S. Navy personnel to depart. and she was rejected for further U.S. Navy service on 2 April 1919. Honolulu was returned to the United States Shipping Board and sold on 26 January 1920. Honolulu resumed commercial service, and was sold 1923 to Moore- McCormack.

She represented District 27, which includes parts of her native Lake Charles and the surrounding cities of Sulphur and Westlake. From 1993 to 1999, Mount was the first woman to serve as the mayor of Lake Charles. Mount was a candidate in the 2004 U.S. House of Representatives election for Louisiana's 7th congressional district. She was defeated by Republican Charles Boustany in a contested general election campaign that received national attention. ==Personal life== In 1974, Mount obtained a Bachelor of Business Administration degree from McNeese State University in Lake Charles. She owned a small business and worked as a real estate agent and pharmaceutical representative for Lederle Laboratories. Mount resides in her hometown with her husband, attorney Benjamin Mount; they have no children. ==Career== Mount had been active in community work through organizations such as the Junior League of Lake Charles, and ran for mayor of Lake Charles in 1993. She defeated Paul Savoie, a Democrat and a former mayor. During her tenure she served as president of the Louisiana Conference of Mayors and supported restoration efforts following hurricanes. To this end Mount testified before Congress in support of the Conservation and Reinvestment Act of 1999. She co- sponsored the building of an Amtrak station, modeled after an older station that had been destroyed in a fire. In an effort to succeed retiring state senator James J. Cox, Mount announced her Senate candidacy on October 19, 1999, while addressing the Calcasieu Parish School Board, whose support she sought. Upon being elected, Mount resigned as mayor and City Council President Rodney Geyen took over the office. In the senate, Mount served on a variety of committees, chairing the Senate Committees on Coastal Restoration and Flood Control, Revenue and Fiscal Affairs, and also serving as Vice-Chair of the Senate Committee on Education. In 2008, she became chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Health and Welfare. Mount often sponsors legislation regarding health and public service. This includes bills intended to identify sex offenders and enact term limits for various boards and commissions. She was responsible for passing these term limits as an amendment to the Louisiana Constitution, as SB 232 on November 4, 2008. Mount also sponsored legislation to merge New Orleans criminal and civil district courts, create a childhood and family learning center, couple the opening of new hospice care providers with inspections of existing ones, allow police to suspend driver's licenses of teenagers with problems at school, and create a state-run internet database providing information on the quality of health care providers. Mount was responsible for legislation that made Louisiana water fluoridation mandatory, and, in her capacity as chair of the Senate Health committee, Mount in 2008 declared major Louisiana health care reform unlikely without prior federal reform. Willie Mount 2008‚Äì2012 session license plate As senator, Mount raised funds for health care facilities (Mount had herself roasted in support of the Southwest Louisiana Center for Health Services). Mount is a member of a number of boards and charitable organisations and provides an annual compilation of \\"Louisiana positives\\" about Louisiana's standing in national ratings. Because of term limits, Mount was eligible to serve as a state senator until 2012. ==2004 Congressional race== Mount ran for Congress in 2004 to succeed Chris John, who instead ran for the United States Senate but lost to Republican David Vitter. She positioned herself as a Conservative Democrat who supported balanced budgets and conservative social views, emphasizing job creation, health care and her opposition to offshoring. Her major Democratic opponent in the jungle primary was African American State Senator Don Cravins, Sr., the father of another lawmaker, Don Cravins, Jr., of Opelousas. Her major Republican opponent was Charles Boustany, a retired heart surgeon from Lafayette, who ran on a platform of preventing tax increases and passing a new energy bill. The Louisiana Democratic Party was supporting Mount, as Cravins was believed to be a weaker contestant in a run-off. Polls taken in late October had shown Boustany, Cravins and Mount statistically tied, and the election was hotly contested. In the first ballot on November 2, 2004, Boustany and Mount garnered the most votes; Cravins was defeated by less than two thousand votes. As both fell short of a majority, a second ballot was mandated. In the subsequent campaign, Mount criticized Boustany for favoring tax cuts for the rich and being indifferent to health care, while Boustany rejected the attacks as false and stressed his willingness to work with Democrats and Independents. Boustany in turn portrayed Mount as liberal and favoring tax increases. Mount criticized Boustany for favoring the privatization of social security, an unpopular position in Louisiana, and as distant from the interests of individual voters. She received endorsements from U.S. Senator John Breaux, who had represented the 7th district for over fourteen years, and Governor Kathleen Blanco. Boustany was helped by Vice President Dick Cheney, who campaigned on his behalf in Lake Charles. Mount, however, was not endorsed by Democratic primary opponent Don Cravins, who complained about the state Democratic Party's endorsement of Mount in a partially party funded mailer that excluded him and which he believed contributed to his narrow loss. Cravins prepared a suit in federal court claiming that the state Democratic Party violated the Voting Rights Act. In the general election on December 4, 2004, Boustany defeated Mount, 55 percent to 45 percent in an election with low voter turnout. Democrats had hoped on a big turnout, as the district is nearly a quarter African American, a reliable Democratic constituency. Analysis of the race suggested that Mount's defeat was helped by the open primary system that had the Democratic candidates work against each other and led to Cravin's conflict with the state Democratic Party which in turn led to suppressed voter turnout. The large number of negative advertisements was also cited as a factor that contributed to low turnout. Another detriment for Mount mentioned was the strong support for George W. Bush in the presidential election against John Kerry in the district, which he carried by about 60 percent of the vote. Following her defeat for Congress, Mount ruled out another campaign for the House seat, but she said she may later seek another statewide office. When Mount left the Senate in 2012, she was succeeded by a Democrat-turned-Republican, former State Representative Ronnie Johns of Sulphur, who ran unopposed for the open seat. ==Campaign for tax assessor== In 2011, Mount announced her candidacy for tax assessor of Calcasieu Parish. She received 13,477 votes (38.3 percent) in the primary held on October 22 and promptly withdrew from the November 19 general election. Victory hence went to the acting assessor, Wendy Curphy Aguillard, an Independent who led the primary balloting with 17,208 votes (48.9 percent). A third candidate, Republican Mike Regan, was also eliminated in the primary, having received the remaining 4,538 votes (12.9 percent). ==Electoral history== Mayor, City of Lake Charles, 1993 Threshold > 50% First Ballot, April 3, 1993 {   bgcolor=#cccccc  Candidate  bgcolor=#cccccc  Affiliation  bgcolor=#cccccc  Support  bgcolor=#cccccc  Outcome - bgcolor=#DDEEFF Willie Landry Mount bgcolor=#DDEEFF Democratic bgcolor=#DDEEFF 7,106 (35.67%) bgcolor=#DDEEFF Run-off - bgcolor=#DDEEFF Paul A.

The book focuses on the controversy surrounding the now discredited link between vaccines and autism. The current scientific consensus is that no convincing scientific evidence supports these claims, and a 2011 journal article described the vaccine-autism connection as \\"the most damaging medical hoax of the last 100 years\\". == Summary == Offit describes the origins and development of claims regarding the MMR vaccine and the vaccine preservative thiomersal, as well as subsequent scientific evidence which has disproved a link with autism. The book discusses possible explanations for the persistence of these claims in the face of scientific evidence to the contrary, as well as the proliferation of potentially risky and unproven treatments for autism. The author takes a critical view of several advocates of a vaccine‚Äìautism link, including Andrew Wakefield, David Kirby, Mark Geier, and Boyd Haley, raising scientific and, in some cases, ethical and legal concerns. The book also explores divisions within the autism community on the topic of vaccines, as some parents consider the ongoing narrow focus on vaccines a distraction from more scientifically promising avenues of research. In this vein, Offit interviews Kathleen Seidel, a mother of an autistic child who has published investigations critical of those who profit from promoting vaccine‚Äìautism claims. Offit also touches on the heated and bitter debate surrounding vaccine claims. He describes receiving death threats, hate mail, and threats against his children as a result of his advocacy for vaccination. Offit declined to do a book tour for Autism's False Prophets, citing concerns about his physical safety and comparing the intensity of hatred and threats directed at him to that experienced by abortion providers. Author's royalties from the book are being donated to the Center for Autism Research at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. == Reception == The book was the nucleus of profiles of Offit in Newsweek and The Philadelphia Inquirer. The New York Post reviewed the book positively, concluding: \\"Although arguably the most courageous and most knowledgeable scientist about vaccines in the United States, Offit lives in fear for his life and that of his family.\\" The Wall Street Journal also praised the book as \\"an invaluable chronicle that relates some of the many ways in which the vulnerabilities of anxious parents have been exploited.\\" The Philadelphia Inquirer wrote that the book \\"names names and calls nonsense nonsense\\", and provides \\"important insight into the fatal flaws of the key arguments of vaccine alarmists.\\" The Inquirer applauded Offit's focus on slanted and sensationalist media coverage of the vaccine‚Äìautism issue, but faulted Offit for not holding scientists themselves sufficiently accountable for their failure to communicate the facts to the public. The Rocky Mountain News noted that the book \\"turned the tables\\" on those who see a pharmaceutical-industry conspiracy behind vaccination, by pointing out that the advocates of the autism‚Äìvaccine link receive large sums of money from lawyers and lobbyists. The News applauded the book's deconstruction of \\"misinformation\\" from Don Imus, Jenny McCarthy, Joseph Lieberman, and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., among others, but found Offit's \\"sarcasm and brow-beating of those he disagrees with\\" to be \\"grating\\". Salon reviewed the book as an \\"enlightening, highly readable, and ... timely\\" work which \\"deconstruct[s] the anti-vaccine movement as one driven by bad science, litigious greed, hype and ego.\\" Salon faulted Offit for minimizing the work that autism advocacy groups have done to raise awareness, create support networks, and obtain research funding; the review noted that Offit focuses instead on aggressive and scientifically \\"slanted\\" groups like Defeat Autism Now! and Generation Rescue. The review concluded that the book \\"effectively pulls back the curtain on the anti-vaccine movement to reveal a crusade grounded less in fact and more in greed and opportunism\\". Science called the book \\"forceful\\" and \\"an easy-to- read medical thriller about the consequences of greed, hubris, and intellectual sloppiness.\\" The review noted that Offit did not discuss the irrationality of human decision-making in the presence of relative risk and both anecdotal and empirical evidence, and mentioned that Offit did not carefully discuss the role of regression. In conclusion, the review observed that the book has emboldened the media to apply scientific principles, and called for using the book's momentum to shift resources from the autism‚Äìvaccination debate to research into causes and treatments. The Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders said the book \\"makes an important contribution to popular debates about the etiology and treatment of autism spectrum disorders. The book is arguably the most detailed and thorough history available of the current anti-vaccine movement\\". The review noted one possible weakness: the book gives light coverage to the public's fundamental misunderstanding of the epidemiology of autism, in that the public fears an \\"autism epidemic\\" that may not in fact be occurring. The review concluded with a call to scientists and physicians to follow Offit's lead in communicating to the public even uncomfortable truths about autism. Four months after its release, The New York Times reported that the book had been endorsed widely by pediatricians, autism researchers, vaccine companies, and medical journalists, and was \\"galvanizing a backlash against the antivaccine movement in the United States.\\" Many doctors are critical of \\"false equivalence\\" in media coverage of the vaccine issue, and now argue that reporters should treat the antivaccine lobby with the same level of indifference as AIDS denialism and other fringe theories. Later in 2009, the New England Journal of Medicine reported that the book effectively advocated for vaccines and refuted the vaccine‚Äìautism myth. It noted that a particular strength of the book is its outline of the scientific method and the basic principles of probability and causality, and its coverage of the difficulty of explaining science to the public, such as the difference between causality and coincidence. It noted as a weakness the book's several diversions into topics such as breast implants. Other largely favorable reviews appeared in BioScience, in Health Affairs, and in the Journal of Child Neurology. In a guest column for The Atlanta Journal- Constitution, neurologist Jon Poling panned Offit's book as \\"a novel of perceived good and evil\\". Poling, whose daughter was federally compensated for vaccine injuries, criticized Offit for attacking those with whom he disagrees: \\"In the story, Offit takes no prisoners, smearing characters in the vaccine- autism controversy as effortlessly as a rich cream cheese.\\" == See also == * MMR vaccine and autism * Thiomersal and vaccines * Folk epidemiology of autism ==References  External links == * Columbia University Press web page for Autism's False Prophets * Excerpt from the book's prologue Category:2008 non- fiction books Category:American non-fiction books Category:Books about autism Category:Books by Paul Offit Category:Columbia University Press books Category:Medical books Category:Scientific skepticism mass media Category:MMR vaccine and autism ","title":"Autism's False Prophets"},{"id":"20201305","text":"St Benedict's High School is a Roman Catholic High School in Linwood, Renfrewshire, in the west of Scotland. ==The school== St Benedict's High School was formed by the amalgamation of St Cuthbert's High School in Johnstone and St Brendan's High School in Linwood.

However, it originally appeared in the Spanish national newspaper El Pa√≠s in regular installments. The story is about an alien who is lost in Barcelona whilst in search of his friend Gurb.Sin noticias de Gurb Published by elpais.com Through taking on the appearances of various people, including the famous Spanish singer Marta S√°nchez, he explores the city observing human life. The book is in the style of a diary, so the reader is taken day by day along the same journey with the alien, as he discovers more and more about the human race. ==Narrative== The author in 2008 The story begins with the narrator talking about his ideas and aims of travelling to Earth and adapting to the lifestyle there. Through writing this book, Mendoza captures an image of Barcelona as it is preparing for the Olympics in 1992. The atmosphere at that time, along with the chaos and absurdities of modern human life, are among the subjects that are focused on in this satirical novel. As a parody, \\"No Word from Gurb\\" depicts the day-to-day life of the city from the perspective of an alien. The author focuses in particular on portraying the urban lifestyle of humans; using Barcelona as a great example of a big city. Parody is a feature that is present throughout the book, an example of which is when the alien describes the composition of water as \\"hydrogen, oxygen and poo.\\" Throughout his search for his friend Gurb, the alien criticises the behaviour of human beings and realises that there are many differences between his culture and that of humans. For example, although he doesn't understand why, he notes that there are class divisions on Earth: there are rich and poor areas of Barcelona, like San Cosme and Pedralbes. Furthermore, he criticises the chaos regarding the upcoming Olympic Games at the time. In reality, there was a lot of public criticism due to the reported lack of organisation when planning and preparing for the international event. Mendoza again describes the disorganisation of the city as a parody. Translations of the novel are available in English, French, German, Italian, Danish, Romanian, Polish and Bulgarian. ==Character Descriptions== *The narrator: is shy and doesn't like to attract attention, something which causes him difficulties when he transforms into famous people in an effort to fit into society on Earth. *Gurb: is very different from his friend, the narrator. He is decisive, independent and is shown to have no concern for the narrator. *The neighbour: is a young single mother. The main character is in love with her, although for the moment, she is not interested in him. *Mr Joaquin and Mrs Mercedes: are the owners of the bar where the narrator often goes. They are a friendly and hard-working elderly couple who are suffering from health problems. ==References * The official page of Eduardo Mendoza in Spanish *Mendoza, Eduardo (1991), Sin noticias de Gurb Seix Barral, edition 1a (2002), Category:Spanish speculative fiction novels Category:1990 science fiction novels Category:Novels set in Barcelona ","title":"No Word from Gurb"},{"id":"20201315","text":"Hutt Park railway station may refer to: * Hutt Park railway station, Gracefield, a closed railway station on the Gracefield Branch line in New Zealand * Hutt Park railway station, Petone, a closed railway station on the Hutt Park Railway in New Zealand ","title":"Hutt Park railway station"},{"id":"20201381","text":"The Shocker is the debut album of American rapper Silkk the Shocker, who was then known as Silkk.

He was raised amongst the Kikuyu people of central Kenya, and was known for his mastery of the Gikuyu language as well as for the authenticity of his accent. ==Education== After his formative years, he went to George Watson's School in Edinburgh, Scotland and went to study divinity at the University of Edinburgh, after which he spent a year studying at the Budapest College of the Reformed Church in Hungary. ==Ministry in Kenya== In 1937 he returned to Kenya as a missionary, where his first station was at his birthplace Tumutumu. While there, he lived and worked as a missionary and also served as a chaplain in the British Army throughout World War II. In 1946 he married Jeane Caddick whom he had met while a student at the University of Edinburgh and after returning to Kenya set up home at Tumutumu. He was well known for his love and identification with, the Kikuyu people of Kenya. During the Mau Mau insurgency, many of the Kikuyu who refused to take the Mau Mau oath were in danger of being killed. Philp successfully acted as a mediator on behalf of some of the Kikuyu to the British authorities. Philp taught at St. Paul's University, Limuru, where he was active in preparing and equipping Africans to become ministers. He later became the first Church of Scotland missionary at Nakuru in the Great Rift Valley, and then worked at Thogoto, a village near Nairobi. He was well regarded for his work in encouraging close partnerships with his African colleagues, and was tireless in his efforts to foster good relations between Kenyans and Europeans. ==Kenyatta trial== In 1952 while serving as a missionary in Kenya he acted as interpreter during the trial of Jomo Kenyatta. Kenyatta was charged with \\"managing and being a member\\" of Mau Mau, the insurgency rebellion against British rule in Kenya. Although he knew English well, Kenyatta determined to speak only in his native language, Kikuyu. The role of court translator was initially given to the archaeologist Louis Leakey, but due to challenges to his translation, Leakey resigned and was replaced by Philp. After a guilty verdict was rendered in April 1953, Kenyatta received a sentence of seven years' hard labour and he remained in prison until 1959. ==Later ministry in the United Kingdom== After 23 years as a second-generation missionary, personal circumstances caused Philp reluctantly to resign in 1960, from the Church of Scotland Mission and leave Kenya. Philp became a Church of Scotland minister at Stepps, Scotland near Glasgow. Due to his influence, several of his congregation became missionaries or ministers. Philp retired in 1981, at the age of 69. He and his wife lived in Leeds, England where they became involved with a Congregational church, and later in Bath, where they became part of an Anglican church community. In 1988 the Presbyterian Church of East Africa celebrated the 90th anniversary of the first Scottish missionaries' arrival in Kenya, and requested Philp to attend as guest of honour. While there, he returned to his birthplace, Tumutumu, and he discovered that he had retained his fluency in Kikuyu after 28 years in Britain. The Presbyterian Church of East Africa's service of celebration at Thogoto was attended by more than 5,000 people, including President Daniel Arap Moi, and in his speech, as Philp spoke in Kikuyu, without notes, the attendees broke into spontaneous applause. ==Last days== After his wife Jeanne died in 2005, he lived for the rest of his life at Bybrook Nursing Home near Bath, but he always had a love for Kenya, and it was his Kikuyu Bible that he chose to read, rather than an English one. He and his wife had three daughters, Mary, Joan and Dorothy. Philp died on 1 March 2008. His funeral service was held at All Saint's Church, Weston, England. On 18 March 2008 and his ashes were buried in Kenya, among the Kikuyu people, because, as he once said, \\"after all, that is where I am from.\\" ==References== *Obituary.

Instead it was an entirely different gas operated, blow-forward design borrowed from the semi-automatic Bang rifle of 1903. This Bang system was first transposed in 1905 to the French Puteaux APX Machine Gun which soon proved to be unsatisfactory. Then, two years later, the Mle 1907 \\"St-√âtienne\\" machine gun followed as an improved redesign of the \\"Puteaux\\" machine gun. However the Mle 1907 \\"St-√âtienne\\" was only a partial redesign: the original blow-forward gas piston, rack-and-pinion system, and bolt mechanism of the Mle 1905 \\"Puteaux\\" machine gun had all been kept only slightly modified inside the newer weapon. Eventually a total of over 39,700 \\"St-√âtienne\\" Mle 1907 machine guns were manufactured between 1908 and late 1917. They were widely used by French infantry during the early part of World War I until their replacement by the distinctly more reliable Hotchkiss M1914 machine-gun. ==History== The Mle 1907 was used extensively by French units during the early stages of the first world war. Around the turn of the century the French military evaluated machine guns made by the private French firm of Hotchkiss et Cie. While the tests were technically convincing, following which Hotchkiss machine-guns were purchased for French alpine and colonial troops, it was decided for political reasons that a machine gun for French line infantry had to originate from state-owned arms manufacturers. A first attempt by a French government arsenal near Paris (APX) was the Puteaux M1905 machine gun inspired by the first gas actuated blow forward Bang rifle system of 1903. It was a deliberate attempt to develop an infantry machine gun that would be mechanically different from the patented Hotchkiss Mle 1900 machine gun design. However, the M1905 Puteaux machine gun soon proved to be unsatisfactory. Consequently, the national arsenal at Saint-√âtienne (MAS) thoroughly reworked and modified the Puteaux machine gun resulting in some measure of improvement but also increased complexity‚Äî64 component parts for the St-√âtienne Mle 1907 vs. only 32 parts for the Hotchkiss Mle 1914. Barrel changes on the Mle 1907 St-√âtienne were much easier than on the M1905 Puteaux and its firing rate could be set at any point between eight rounds per minute and about 600 rounds per minute. Either metal strips different from those used on the Hotchkiss machine gun or else fabric belts, the latter introduced in 1916, for the 8mm Lebel ammunition could be used. George Chinn notes about the 1907 model that: \\"While it was gas actuated by means of a piston, the French reversed the conventional principle. Instead of the piston thrust rearward furnishing the source of energy to operate the piece, the gas propels the piston forward to unlock the bolt. The piston is attached by a spring-loaded rod to a gear rack. This in turn engages a spur gear which is fastened to an actuating lever. When the lever is in the forward horizontal position and engages a cam slot in the bolt, the gun is locked. Upon firing, the gas drives the piston forward, compressing the spring and causing the spur gear to rotate clockwise. The actuating lever turns with the gear for a half revolution, retracting the bolt and stopping at the rear horizontal position. The driving spring then forces the piston rearward, which reverses the action and returns the bolt to battery.\\"George Chinn (1951), The Machine Gun, vol. 1, p. 194, web version Nevertheless, in the muddy environment of trench warfare the mechanically complex St-√âtienne Mle 1907 suffered from frequent stoppages and was difficult to maintain by front-line soldiers. A quote from a French post- war military evaluation says it all: \\"admirable weapon, patented clockwork, but very delicate and sparing its whims only for machine-gun virtuosos.\\"Revue d'Infanterie No 487, p. 486, April 1933 In July 1917 the Mle 1907 St-√âtienne was gradually withdrawn from front line service and replaced by the distinctly simpler and more reliable Hotchkiss M1914 machine gun. Large numbers of the M1907 St-√âtienne machine gun were then transferred to military units in the rear, to the French colonies, and to the Italian Army. Many also ended up in the Greek Army during the 1920s. Altogether 39,700 Mle 1907 St-√âtienne machine guns had been manufactured when the decision to close down their last assembly line was taken in November 1917. The Mle 1907-T was still in service at the beginning of World War II, for instance with second-line units. German soldier examining a captured St. √âtienne Mle 07 in May 1940.

Its last assignment was with 11th Air Division stationed at Ladd Air Force Base, Alaska, where it was inactivated on 25 August 1960. The squadron was first activated in 1943 as the 449th Fighter Squadron and engaged in combat in China during World War II. Following VJ Day, it returned to the United States and was inactivated. It was reactivated in Alaska in 1947. ==HistoryWorld War II=== The squadron was first organized in China as the 449th Fighter Squadron and equipped with Lockheed P-38 Lightnings. It fought in the China Burma India Theater from 1943 to 1945. Former Heisman Trophy-winner Tom Harmon was a member of the unit during their stint in the CBI. ===Alaskan air defense=== The 449th was reactivated at Adak Army Air Field as part of Alaskan Air Command in September 1947 and equipped with Northrop P-61 Black Widow night fighters.

These aircraft were modified to the F-82H model with the addition of cold weather equipment and additional de-icers. Many of these fighters operated with Strategic Air Command where they served as escorts for the massive Convair B-36 Peacemaker bomber during long flights over the Arctic. The 449th Fighter- Interceptor Squadron was the last USAF unit equipped with the F-82, retiring the model in 1953Dalby, p. 16 when a lack of parts made it impossible to keep the aging airframes flying. The retirement of the F-82 marked the end of front-line use of USAF propeller driven fighter aircraft. Many were ultimately scrapped in Alaska. Squadron F-94AAircraft is Lockheed F-94A-5-LO Starfighter serial 49-2531 The squadron replaced their Twin Mustangs with jet Lockheed F-94 Starfires armed with 20mm cannon in 1952. The Starfire was not suited to service in the Arctic. When equipped with cold weather gear, the radar operator in the rear seat was cramped and found it difficult to operate. Moreover, the aircraft proved difficult to maintain and had a high accident rate. By mid 1954, the squadron had converted to the Northrop F-89 Scorpion. It initially flew a mix of F-89Cs, armed with cannon and F-89Ds, armed with Mighty Mouse rockets in wing pods. In 1957, the squadron converted to the F-89J, which was armed with the nuclear MB-1 Genie air to air missile. After August 1958, the squadron maintained air defense of northern Alaska under the command of North American Air Defense Command.Dalby, p. 17 It inactivated in 1960 along with turnover of Ladd to the United States Army as part of Fort Wainwright. ===Lineage=== * Constituted as the 449th Fighter Squadron, Two Engine on 2 August 1943 : Activated on 26 August 1943 : Inactivated on 25 December 1945 * Activated on 1 September 1947 : Redesignated: 449th Fighter Squadron, All Weather on 20 July 1948 : Redesignated: 449th Fighter-All Weather Squadron on 20 January 1950 : Redesignated: 449th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron on 1 June 1951 : Discontinued and inactivated on 25 August 1960 ===Assignments=== * 51st Fighter Group, 26 August 1943 ‚Äì 13 December 1945 (attached to 23d Fighter Group until October 1943) * Alaskan Air Command, 1 September 1947 (attached to 5001st Composite Group after 1 May 1949) * 5001st Composite Wing, 1 July 1949 * 11th Air Division, 8 April 1953 * 5001st Air Defense Group, 20 September 1954 * 11th Air Division, 1 October 1955 ‚Äì 25 August 1960 ===Stations=== * Kunming, China, 26 August 1943 * Lingling Airfield, China, 26 August 1943 : Detachments operated from Hengyang and Kweilin Airfield, China, September 1943 * Suichwan Airfield, China, February 1944 * Kweilin Airfield, China, June 1944 * Chengkung Airfield, China, 16 July 1944 : Detachments operated from: Yunnani Airfield, China, c. 23 July 1944 ‚Äì March 1945; Mengtsze, China, March 1945 and Posek, China, 12 April ‚Äì May 1945 * Mengtsze, China, c. 13 July 1945 * India, September ‚Äì November 1945 * Fort Lewis, Washington, 19 ‚Äì 25 December 1945, * Adak Army Air Field (later Davis Air Force Base), Alaska, 1 September 1947 * Ladd Air Force Base, Alaska, 28 March 1949 ‚Äì 25 August 1960 ===Aircraft=== * Lockheed P-38 Lightning, 1943‚Äì1945 * Northrop P-61 Black Widow, 1947‚Äì1949 * North American F-82 Twin Mustang, 1948‚Äì1953 * Lockheed F-94B Starfire, 1952‚Äì1954 * Northrop F-89C Scorpion, 1954‚Äì1957 * Northrop F-89D Scorpion, 1954‚Äì1957 * Northrop F-89J Scorpion, 1957‚Äì1960 ==See also== * F-89 Scorpion units of the United States Air Force * F-94 Starfire units of the United States Air Force * List of Lockheed P-38 Lightning operators ==ReferencesNotes=Bibliography=== * * Davis, Larry (1996).

He is the Hills' overweight, divorced, and clinically depressed neighbor, voiced by Stephen Root and named for series producer Jim Dauterive. ==Production== Stephen Root used his background in Southern theater to help him develop the voice of Bill. Root attended the University of Florida, and had performed in Southern plays in New York City prior to being chosen for the role. He originally auditioned for the role of Dale Gribble, which \\"didn't feel right\\" so he then auditioned for Bill. ==Personality== Bill is indicated as coming from an upper-class Cajun family in Louisiana: the family lived on a vast estate called the Chateau D'Haute Rive (\\"castle on the high bank\\") until his cousin, Gilbert, was forced to sell it. He speaks fluent Cajun French and plays the accordion skillfully, which surprises him just as much as it does everyone else. His father was abusive, spanking him regularly, locking him in a rabbit hutch and making him wear dresses (Bill attempts to justify these actions when he mentions them), As of the season 2 episode \\"The Final Shinsult,\\" Bill's father is presumably still alive (though slowing down in his later years), based upon Bill's remark to Hank that his father \\"can't even load a hunting rifle anymore,\\" with Bill further commenting that he has to \\"practically put it in his hands and pull the trigger.\\" By the time of the season 4 episode \\"A Beer Can Named Desire,\\" Bill's only living male relative is his dandified cousin Gilbert, who still lives in Louisiana. By season 11, the two are guardians of the family's secret barbecue sauce recipe, which Gilbert refuses to allow Bill to sell. (However, Bill eventually gives the recipe to Bobby Hill so he can pass it on to his children, thus keeping the Dauterive tradition alive). Though Bill says he never had any children of his own, there is an opened possibility of him getting one or both of his dead cousins' widows pregnant during his stay at the family mansion while Hank was trying to win money by throwing a football into a big Alamo beer can at the Louisiana Superdome during halftime of the Dallas Cowboys‚ÄìNew Orleans Saints game. Although overweight, balding, and emotionally needy in his later years, Bill was a muscular, confident athlete with long flowing hair in his youth. Nicknamed \\"The Billdozer\\", he held Arlen High's career touchdown record until a young athlete named Ricky Suggs broke it years later. Ricky, however, is simply allowed to score the record-breaking touchdown by the other team due to a torn ACL, rather than playing injured as Bill would have; to regain his honor Bill rejoins the team to score one last touchdown and re-tie the record (he had redshirt eligibility due to joining the Army during his senior year). Bill's bright future was derailed when he attended a Molly Hatchet concert and found his future wife Lenore passed out in his lap in 1991; she would go on to cheat on and humiliate Bill before finally leaving him a broken shell of his former self. Although there appear to be several factors, it can generally be assumed that her leaving him was the major cause of his downward spiral. In the episode \\"Order of the Straight Arrow,\\" Bill says \\"I'm so depressed, I can't even blink\\", upon the reminiscence of his childhood days as an Arrow Scout and remembering his wishes to be a free spirited pilot like his father. Bill's negative self-concept is clearly displayed in the episode \\"A Firefighting We Will Go\\"; Bill, Dale, Hank, and Boomhauer recall an evening's events, and, while the other three characters imagine themselves in a positive light, Bill imagines himself as being balder, fatter, and more of a glutton than he is in reality. Despite all of this, Bill is loyal and brave in the face of adversity, rescuing the Hills from their house after smelling a gas leak and resuscitating both Peggy and Hank on their front lawn afterwards. Bill is often a foil for his friends, who verbally and emotionally put him down on a regular basis, either because they don't realize how hurtful their remarks are or because Bill is too dimwitted to mind very much. He is the first person to be mentioned when any character refers to losers or bemoans a misfortune for fear their lives will be ruined, like his. For example, Hank, while telling Peggy that a lawn makes a man and gives him a purpose, says \\"Without my lawn, I am Bill,\\" which disgusts Peggy as the thought of being with Bill nauseates her to no end. Bill, like Dale Gribble and Jeff Boomhauer, has a strong admiration for Hank and often seeks his advice before doing anything, and for his help when in trouble. He occasionally gets dragged into Dale's crazy schemes, and often is the one who accidentally ruins them. Of all his acquaintances, Boomhauer seems to be the one who gives him the most respect, possibly because Bill once helped a brokenhearted Boomhauer get over a girl who dumped him. Dale is the one who seems to disrespect him the most, often insulting his misfortune and lifestyle. Bill has an obsessive crush on Peggy, and frequently makes bumbling, inappropriate remarks about her. Although Bill always speaks highly of Peggy and looks to her as the epitome of desire, she looks at him in total contrast‚Äîspeaking of him as absolute zero. Although Bill's friends are often disgusted or frustrated at his stupidity and the number of times he has wrecked their plans, they were devastated when it appeared that he had sacrificed himself to save them when they were stuck on a military target zone, with Hank saying that he was a good friend ‚Äì sweet, loyal, and brave. During their high school years as they have one last blowout in Bill's honor as he's being shipped off a drunken Hank stirs up a fight with a thug at a bar, but Bill intervenes and saves Hank. On some occasions, Bill will fight back, and relentlessly, if pushed enough; upon the words of a fraudulent and condescending doctor who would sarcastically and falsely told him he would lose his legs from diabetes shortly after his diagnosis, and had toyed with Bill's social life and the friends he made along the way, he would exact a beating on him, alongside Hank. When examining Bill's Army medical history, Dale discovered that Bill was unknowingly made part in an experiment called \\"Operation: Infinite Walrus\\", to create a hybrid soldier capable of operating in freezing cold waters. It is assumed that the experimental drugs are the cause of his weight gain, excessive body hair, baldness, and terrible body odor and breath until it's revealed that he was in the control group given a placebo. Bill is also shown to have a severe but easily treatable foot fungus, which actually comes in handy once to help Hank get revenge on a fraudulent mold inspector. Bill was diagnosed with diabetes and was told he would lose his ability to walk, but then later this was contradicted by the inept diagnosing doctor, who says that he only said Bill was likely to lose his ability to walk from diabetes. Originally the doctor made it seem like Bill would ultimately need to use a wheelchair. (Later, Bill beats him up for this, with Hank standing guard.) Ironically, this \\"diagnosis\\" leads Bill to a depressed slump, where he meets Thunder, a wheelchair-using muscle man who plays a wheelchair-friendly version of Rugby. This then leads Bill to get into better shape while playing the sport and this cured his diabetes. Bill's personal hygiene and other habits are shown to be very poor. As previously mentioned he has severe foot fungus, terrible breath and body odor (when opening the hatch of a tank Bill had stolen, Hank believed there was a dead animal inside due to the smell). Various comments indicate that he doesn't shower or brush his teeth on a regular basis. Bobby states that he has dandruff in spite of being bald. He is regularly shown eating food he finds in or under his couch, and has even been shown to eat food without dishes (as in one episode where he was cooking himself spaghetti, where he broke his only plate and was forced to eat the spaghetti off of his counter and drink the jar of sauce he was going to serve with it). He dumps garbage directly out his kitchen window despite having a garbage can. He has been shown to fall asleep while eating snacks, which attracts animals into his bedroom, though he seems incredulous or apathetic to this. His bathroom is described as disgusting, when asked if they would rather endure a dangerous and painful stunt (ex. stick a wasp up your nose) or shower in Bill's bathroom, his friends always choose the former. When assigned tasks to get his house ready for a family reunion after Nancy and Peggy are assigned the bathroom, both are horrified and desperately try to change assignments. He also has a foot fetish, finding Peggy's unnaturally over-sized feet very appealing, and even tries to take her discarded full-body cast as she convalesces following a disastrous skydive. Bill is also portrayed as being the poorest of Hank's friends. However, he resides in a similar looking house as all the other members of the main cast (one episode reveals he won it in his divorce). Moreover, although Bill is portrayed as poor he is often seen spending money on extravagant, or needless items. This is likely because he generally does not date nor has any family leaving him with extra income. Moreover, while Dale and Nancy can not afford a plastic surgery in the episode \\"Trouble With The Gribbles\\", Bill offers to pay for it himself, signifying that he may be wealthier than the Gribble family. Despite being physically out of shape, a target of many pranks, and incompetent in many areas Bill is shown to be a great barber at his local army base, so much so that when in episode \\"Hank's Bad Hair Day\\", when the army eliminates barbers, the base commander makes sure to keep Bill as the base's barber, making him perhaps the only military barber remaining in the army. == Physical appearance == Bill Dauterive is overweight and balding, and often falls victim to Dale's harassment. Possibly because of low self-esteem and depression, Bill does not regularly brush his teeth, shower, or exercise, only doing these things when dating a woman. When introducing himself to a lawnmower focus group in \\"Nine Pretty Darn Angry Men\\", he states that he is 5‚Äô8.75\\" (174.6 cm). Although currently overweight Bill is shown to be in incredible shape when first joining the army and when met by old friends they are generally surprised to see how out of shape he became. He is depicted as not meeting the Army's Physical Fitness Standards, however he manages to pass by accidents such as the instructor failing to score him and not wanting to redo the test, or injuring himself prior to the test. In the episode \\"Tankin' to the Streets\\", Dale suggests that Bill's weight problems stem from a military program designed to create walrus like soldiers to fight the Russians in the Arctic, however Bill was a member of the placebo group. The likely source of his weight problems comes from depression due to his wife leaving him. Despite being the most overweight out of the show's main characters Bill does on occasion show glimpses of the athleticism he once possessed. In the episode \\"Bills are Made to be Broken\\", Bill is allowed to return to high school to regain his touchdown record because he never graduated and manages to score despite the best efforts of the defense. Also in the episode \\"Bulk and the Body Buddies\\", Bill is shown to be able to bulk up and gain muscle relatively fast when he allows a group of muscle builders to work out in his garage. Although Bill is typically easily bullied by his friends, the times he does decide to stand up to himself people generally back away from him suggesting he is physically intimidating despite being overweight, while Dale routinely threatens individuals to no effect due to his small stature. Bill is also shown as being very tough, while Dale trembles at even the thought of pain, Bill is typically shown working through injuries. In the episode Bill of Sales, he is shown to be a competent sales man and Peggy uses him to win a sales contest, it is shown that Bill works hardest when he is insulted so Peggy continues to push him until he begins to bleed, although Bill continued to work Peggy fired him so that he could get better. == Romantic relationships == Bill Dauterive's ex-wife was named Lenore, who was seen and voiced in the episode \\"Hank and the Great Glass Elevator\\", attempting to worm her way back into Bill's life when he became high-profile while dating former Texas governor Ann Richards.Dallas Morning News Archive During the early seasons, he often pined for Lenore to return after she ran out on him, but he was somewhat successful in getting over her in the episode \\"Pretty Pretty Dresses\\" after Hank resorts to pretending to be Lenore. Bill then finally symbolically confronts Lenore for leaving him, and after being told \\"I don't love you anymore\\" he becomes enraged and yells \\"You don't deserve William Fontaine de la Tour Dauterive!\\". During \\"Hank and the Great Glass Elevator\\", Lenore tries ordering Bill around in front of Ann Richards but he finally tells her off by mooning her. Other relationships include Luanne's mother Leanne Platter (\\"Leanne's Saga\\"), which ended when she reverted to her drunken violent ways and stole his truck, and Kahn's mother Laoma Souphanousinphone (\\"Maid in Arlen\\"), which was broken up by interference from Kahn, who convinced Bill that his mother was in love with astronaut Harrison Schmitt, but they then found out Kahn had been lying because seeing the two of them together disgusted him, and reunited with Kahn grudgingly saying they seemed right together (the show originally intended for Bill and Laoma to remain together, but the writing staff changed that plan and simply wrote her out of the series so Bill could remain unlucky in love to comedic effect, although their relationship is briefly mentioned in one subsequent episode). He also had a brief, mostly sexual, relationship with two of his cousins' widows (\\"A Beer Can Named Desire\\"). In the episode \\"The Untitled Blake McCormick Project,\\" Bill dates a woman named Charlene, and she even moves in with him, however Charlene's past with John Redcorn complicates matters. In a later season, he dated Reverend Karen Stroup for a time and even moved her in with him. When Reverend Stroup and Bill began dating, her congregation showed massive disapproval of their Reverend dating anyone, especially Bill. This meant that they had to carry out their relationship in secret. To Bill, this was exciting. He enjoyed the fact that they were having a relationship that was viewed as immoral by their peers. Unfortunately for Bill, when the pressure became too much for Stroup, she stepped down from her Reverendcy so that they could date like normal people. Bill ultimately broke up with Stroup because he found the relationship was no longer exciting when it was not a secret. Due to his ability to keep going after virtually any rejection, Bill is the one able to snap Boomhauer out of his depression when rejected by a woman he truly had feelings for. Peggy Hill has said and done many cruel things to Bill, both to his face and behind his back with no regards to his feeling. But despite Bill's complete infatuation with Peggy, she seems to loathe him just as much. She brings him endless heartache, though it's not always intentional. For example, during a game of baseball, she once accidentally threw a bean-ball at his head, knocking him to the ground. She then mistakenly threw another at his crotch, putting him in excruciating pain and humiliation. She stole his prized American flag and accidentally destroyed it, driving him to absolute tears. Another time, angry at his endless pursuit of her, she hit him once at a game, she inadvertently wound up knocking him off the bleachers‚Äîhis arm later in a sling. She killed off his character in the video game \\"Pro-Pain\\"‚Äîonce again, making him cry. She, Dale and Minh studied him to make money for their investing endeavors, but eventually dropped him when he became conscious of it all‚Äîdeepening his depression. Despite all of this, she says she considers him \\"a friend.\\" == Work == Bill holds the fictional military occupational specialty \\"barber\\" in the United States Army under Ft. Blanda's H company, 110th infantry. His rank has been revealed through dialogue, in scenes of him wearing obsolete olive drab fatigues as being sergeant, and he appears to wear the insignia of E-5 on his Class A uniform in the episode \\"Old Glory\\". He has never deployed in his Army career. He briefly served as a recruiter when his position was eliminated for being wasteful, but it was secretly restored when Hank donated a new chair, with a cover job as an electrician. He speaks four to six languages (English, French, and Tagalog for sure), of which he used at least four in the army. It is revealed in one episode that as an athletic young man entering the army, he wanted to serve in the armored cavalry in a tank crew. He also was briefly a professional hair stylist with Luanne at the trendy salon Hottyz until it was discovered he wasn't homosexual. Bill and Luanne eventually worked for Hank's barber, Jack, which brought in a young adult clientele and saved Jack from going out of business. Several times throughout the series Bill is revealed to be very talented at cutting hair. When Hank receives a bad hair cut, Bill is able to fix it quite easily. He revealed to Hank that he dyed the hair of 53 officers who serve at Ft. Blanda. When given other military duties such as recruiting, he has no success. While working at Hottyz, a high style salon, Bill and Luanne pitch together to host a chair. Luanne increases her sex appeal and Bill pretends to be gay so he won't offend women. They quickly rise to become \\"first chair.\\" On another episode, it is revealed that the General of the base at won't allow anyone besides Bill cut his hair. When he is engaged by other pursuits, such as when he toured with a choir group called the Harmonoholics or when he decided to run his own halfway house, Bill uses up all his personal and sick days from the army almost to the point of going AWOL; otherwise he doesn't use them at all. He is described as being nice but often depressed and lonely; his overwhelming need to make people like him makes him easily taken advantage of, particularly by Dale. He is overwhelmingly patriotic. When an American Flag is due to be disposed of by burning (as is principal practice), he offers to take the flag and hoist it over his home. When Kahn dares to so much as attempt to lower the flag, Bill lunges at Kahn fiercely. When the flag is destroyed, Bill cries terribly. In the episode \\"Bill of Sales\\" it is also suggested that Bill has emotionally masochistic tendencies‚Äîexplaining his lust for Peggy. No one finds Bill more repellent than she does‚Äîand everyone finds Bill very repellent. After learning this, Peggy's attempt to, in her words, \\"'motivate' him, business term, with a little 'praise', my term, he goes plumb loco, Spanish term.\\" Hank's response, \\"You must have confused him; being dumped on is all Bill knows\\" leads Peggy to conclude that \\"Bill has had a hard life and he likes it that way\\" and subsequently refers to him as a \\"nut job\\". She manages to persuade him to go back to work for her by verbally abusing him. However, she soon fires him out of feelings of guilt for taking advantage of his low self-esteem. It's also during this episode that Bill shows exceptional skills as a salesman, helping Peggy achieve her sales quotas quickly. However, it could be seen as Bill didn't want to betray Hank (afraid that Peggy was coming onto him), and the reason for going back to help Peggy was fear she didn't want to even talk to him anymore. According to Drawn to Television by M. Keith Booker, Bill \\"is a lonely figure who adds a touch of pathos to the humor of King of the Hill, which is often bittersweet.\\" Jim Bawden of the Toronto Star describes Bill as a \\"sad sack\\". Voicing Bill and a couple other characters on the show is Stephen Root's favorite job. == References  External links == Category:King of the Hill characters Category:Fictional hairdressers Category:Fictional Cajuns Category:Fictional characters from Louisiana Category:Fictional characters from Texas Category:Television characters introduced in 1997 Category:Fictional cross-dressers Category:Fictional military sergeants Category:Fictional players of American football Category:Fictional United States Army personnel Category:Fictional victims of child abuse Category:Fictional attempted suicides Category:Male characters in animation ","title":"Bill Dauterive"},{"id":"20201546","text":"Van Boetzelaer (or: van den Boetzelaer) is an old aristocratic family that stems from the region of Kalkar, Germany. ==History== The family history in the Duchy of Cleves can be traced back to the 13th century (\\"Uradel\\"), when the van Boetzelaers belonged to the local nobility.

It became his fifth album to top the Billboard country album charts. It also reached number 66 on the pop albums chart. ==History== Hag was Haggard's first album with a majority of original songs in two years, following two tribute albums (to Jimmie Rodgers and Bob Wills) and two live albums in 1969 and 1970. While Hag spawned no #1 hits, it did include three singles that went to number 3. In his 2013 book The Running Kind, Haggard biographer David Cantwell contends that Hag was \\"the most sustained and closest-to-coherent political statement of his career...The world Hag portrays on Hag is one teetering on the brink. From atop some middle-American watchtower, Merle delivers a nearly despairing state of the union.\\" The album opens with the Ernest Tubb World War II era-hit \\"Soldier's Last Letter,\\" a song that took on a new relevance in 1971 with America's continued involvement in the Vietnam War. Haggard addresses social issues plaguing the country at home, such as street violence (\\"Jesus Take Hold\\") and homelessness (\\"Sidewalks of Chicago\\"). The LP also contains some of Haggard's most delicately sung love songs, such as the melancholy \\"Shelly's Winter Love\\" and \\"The Farmer's Daughter.\\" Haggard would rerecord \\"No Reason to Quit\\" for his 1983 duet album Pancho and Lefty with Willie Nelson. Hag was reissued along with Let Me Tell You About a Song on CD by Beat Goes On Records in 2002.[ Allmusic entry for Hag/Let Me Tell You About a Song.] Retrieved December 2009. ==Reception== Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic calls it \\"one of his absolute best albums‚Äîwhich means a lot, because he recorded no shortage of great records. In contrast to the rowdy live albums and the raucous Western swing that preceded it, Hag is quite quiet and reflective, sometimes referencing the turmoil within America at the end of the '60s, but more often finding Haggard turning inward.\\" Music critic Robert Christgau wrote \\"Four country hits on Haggard's first straight studio album in a year and a half, but only the simple goodbye song \\"I Can't Be Myself\\" escapes bathos.\\" ==Track listing== All songs by Merle Haggard unless otherwise noted: #\\"Soldier's Last Letter\\" (Redd Stewart, Ernest Tubb) ‚Äì 2:11 #\\"Shelly's Winter Love\\" ‚Äì 3:22 #\\"Jesus, Take a Hold\\" ‚Äì 2:16 #\\"I Can't Be Myself\\" ‚Äì 2:51 #\\"I'm a Good Loser\\" ‚Äì 2:38 #\\"Sidewalks of Chicago\\" (Dave Kirby) ‚Äì 2:29 #\\"No Reason to Quit\\" (Dean Holloway) ‚Äì 2:35 #\\"If You've Got Time (To Say Goodbye)\\" ‚Äì 2:52 #\\"The Farmer's Daughter\\" ‚Äì 2:55 #\\"I've Done It All\\" ‚Äì 2:15 ==Personnel== *Merle Haggard‚Äì vocals, guitar The Strangers: *Roy Nichols ‚Äì lead guitar *Norman Hamlet ‚Äì steel guitar, dobro *Bobby Wayne - rhythm guitar, harmony vocals *Dennis Hromek ‚Äì bass, background vocals *Biff Adam ‚Äì drums with *Red Lane ‚Äì guitar *George French ‚Äì piano *Johnny Gimble ‚Äì fiddle and *Earl Ball ‚Äì piano *Glen D.

Laird (July 18, 1908 ‚Äì November 7, 1933), also known by her married name Susan Scavey, was an American competition swimmer who represented the United States at the 1928 Summer Olympics. Laird was born in Homestead, Pennsylvania, and was one of four girls, including Josephine McKim and Lenore Kight, who trained at the Carnegie Library Athletic Club under coach Jack Scarry, her uncle, to represent the United States as members of the Olympic swim team. She began swimming at age 14 on the advice of a physician after developing St. Vitus Dance. The doctor believed swimming as a daily exercise would help to cure her nervous condition. Laird won her first championship in 1924 at Lake Elizabeth in Pittsburgh, completing the 50-yard freestyle in 32 seconds. She placed second in the 100 meters and third in the 300-yard medley at the 1926 Sesquicentennial in Philadelphia. That year, she went on to win the national 100-yard junior championship. In 1928 she qualified for the American Olympic Team, and traveled aboard the S.S. President Roosevelt to Amsterdam, the Netherlands, for the 1928 Summer Olympics. Laird finished fifth in the women's 100-meter freestyle. She also helped the American relay team to qualify for the final of the women's 4√ó100-meter freestyle relay as they set a new world record in the semifinals. Laird did not receive a gold medal, even though the American team finished first in the event final, because she did not swim in the final. After graduating from Temple University in 1930, Laird was appointed girls' coach and physical education instructor at Homestead High School, a position she held until her death from a rare blood disorder and subsequent pneumonia at age 25. ==See also== * List of Olympic medalists in swimming (women) * List of Temple University people * World record progression 4 √ó 100 metres freestyle relay ==References== US women 4 √ó 100 m team at the 1928 Olympics, Laird is third from right Category:1908 births Category:1933 deaths Category:American female freestyle swimmers Category:World record setters in swimming Category:Olympic swimmers of the United States Category:People from Homestead, Pennsylvania Category:Swimmers at the 1928 Summer Olympics Category:Temple University alumni ","title":"Susan Laird"},{"id":"20201722","text":"Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Infant Jesus Convent, commonly referred to as Infant Jesus Convent (IJC) is a secondary school for girls in the city of Malacca, Malaysia. It is also sometimes referred to as the Main Convent or the French Convent (as opposed to the Portuguese Convent, Cannossa). SMK Infant Jesus Convent Malacca is a semi-government funded daily school. This means that syllabus and school activities are regulated by the Ministry of Education, but the school receives little help for repairing and maintaining its condition, because the land is still under church authority. It is one of the 30 Convent secondary schools in Malaysia. As of 2008, IJC is the last remaining IJ Convent in Malaysia whose land is still under church authority. ==Location== IJC is located in the heart of Malacca City, and is a stone's throw away from the historic A Famosa fort and a number of shopping malls. It is situated exactly in front of SK Convent Infant Jesus 1 and 2, its primary sister schools. IJC is located on Jalan Parameswara, which was named after the Palembang prince credited for the opening of Malacca around 1402. ==Academics== Like other secondary schools, it offers lower and upper secondary educations: Form 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. Forms 4 and 5 are split into 2 basic streams, Sciences and Humanities. The School also offers 6th Form education in Mathematics and Humanities. The school is known for its performance in public exams, notably PMR (Lower Secondary Evaluation) and SPM (Malaysian Education Certificate). In 2007, there were 100% passes in the SPM, a feat considered remarkable for a daily school without the privilege of selecting its students. ==School Anthem== Oh, Oh, Oh Let's all in harmony sing, Of the school we love so dear, The life we lead so happily, Among sisters and teachers and friends So, Let's rejoice this day and remember, Simple in virtue, Then Our cares will fade away, Let us sing Let's sing of student days, Of good and jolly days, When students hope and pray, To come back some fine day So let our hearts rejoice, As once again we sing, One of the olden days, Of students days We must get on sad to say, List to our vocation call, But we'll think of student days, God bless them one and all ==Sport Houses== The four sport houses are named after the first four Principals: * Anselm (red) * Mathilde (blue) * Leonard (green) * Marcinenne (yellow) In 2010, SMK Convent Ipoh (in Perak not Melaka) held its 64th Annual Sports Day recently at Stadium Perak. The event was officiated by Dato‚Äô Ir. Dr. Safry Kamal, Chairman of Parent-Teacher Association. The event began with a march-pass of the participating contingents. Their ability to march in sync with the music impressed the crowd of on-lookers and supporters in the stadium stands. The highlight was definitely the inter-school 4 √ó 100 m race between the host, SMK Methodist (P), SMJK Ave Maria Convent, SMJK Perempuan Cina Perak and SMK Jalan Pasir Puteh. SMK Convent Ipoh and SMJK Perempuan Cina Perak clinched the Under-15 and Under-18 titles, respectively. Unique to the event was the cheerleading competition which drew much attention from the crowd. In line with the school‚Äôs vision to become one of the top 200 schools in Malaysia by 2012, the principal, Mdm. Lim Swee Kew, said that achievements in sports and academics were key criteria in achieving the position. The march-pass competition was won by the Kadet Remaja Sekolah while Red House was the adjudged the overall champion.

Shang archaeology is concerned with the archaeological evidence for the Shang dynasty. Choice of excavation sites and interpretation of finds have been heavily influenced by the textual historical record. == Excavation sites == The earliest and to-date most well known Shang site is Yinxu, near Anyang in Henan province. Work began in 1928 initially as an investigation of the source of oracle bones. It was carried out by a team from the new research organisation Academia Sinica, and directed by the Harvard-trained anthropologist Li Ji. Fifteen seasons of excavation were carried out at Anyang until 1937, when the Second Sino- Japanese War forced the archaeologists to evacuate. During that time, the Anyang excavators uncovered large pounded-earth (hangtu) architectural foundations, sacrificial burial cemeteries, and gigantic shaft tombs, not to mention caches of bronze vessels. Historians have come to associate the site with Yinxu, the traditional name of the Shang capital for the last twelve kings of the dynasty, starting with Pan Geng. Excavations at Anyang resumed in 1950, under the auspices of a new Institute of Archaeology, and a permanent field station was established there in 1958. The successes at Anyang encouraged further archaeological efforts, awareness of which has been fostered by the State Bureau of Cultural Relics. In 1952, excavations at Erligang, near Zhengzhou, disclosed the remains of a walled city at least as large as Anyang, but from a demonstrably earlier period. Excavations were difficult, however, because the ancient city lay beneath the modern one. The still older site of Erlitou, near Luoyang, was discovered in 1959 by a survey prospecting for Xia remains. The three sites of Erlitou, Erligang, and Anyang have been taken to provide a complete chronological sequence for the early Bronze Age in China. There have also been other finds away from the Yellow River valley. A significant early achievement was the discovery of an Erligang-period city at Panlongcheng, not far from the Yangzi River. Further and more distinct finds surfaced later in the middle and lower Yangzi regions, including the Wucheng site in Jiangxi, suggesting local civilisations separate from those of the Yellow River region. This argument has grown stronger with the discoveries further afield ‚Äì that of spectacular sacrificial pits at Sanxingdui, Sichuan in 1986, and of a rich tomb at Xingan, Jiangxi, in 1989. == Oracle bones == Oracle bones were first recognised for their true nature in 1898, and scholars have been labouring to decipher them ever since. They circulated among collectors and antique dealers, and to this day some 200,000 oracle bone fragments from the Xiaotun site in Anyang have been counted. These inscriptions record the pyromantic divinations performed at the court of the Shang kings. The king or his diviners would address an oral \\"charge\\" to a specially prepared turtle plastron or cattle scapula while applying a hot poker or brand to produce a series of heat cracks in the shell or bone. They then interpreted these cracks as auspicious or inauspicious, after which engravers carved into the surface of the shell or bone the subject of the charge, sometimes the forecast, and less frequently the result. == Bronze metallurgy == Bronze has been left behind in China in quantities not comparable to anywhere else in the world. Both technologically and artistically, the metalworking tradition that arose in China is unlike any other in the world. The technological feature which distinguishes Shang bronzes from those found elsewhere in the world is the technique of casting as opposed to hammering. Casting was a far more extravagant technique compared to hammering, and required both abundant mineral resources and organisation of labour. The earliest evidence for bronze casting are the two dozen bronze vessels unearthed at Erlitou. Bronzes appear in much large quantities at Erligang, and show technological and artistic advances. ==See also== * History of Chinese archaeology == Further reading == * * * Category:Archaeology of China Archaeology ","title":"Shang archaeology"},{"id":"20202056","text":"The CHUM neon sign at 250 Richmond Street West 250 Richmond Street West is a studio complex in Downtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

When Bell Canada acquired Astral Media they were required by the Competition Bureau to divest a number of certain assets. As a media company in Canada cannot own more than two FM and two AM English radio stations in any one market, Flow 93.5 was subsequently sold while NewsTalk 1010 and Virgin 99.9 were kept through the purchase of Astral. The studios for CFRB and CKFM-FM were previously located at 2 St. Clair Avenue at Yonge and St. Clair until these stations moved to the complex on May 10, 2014. Until 2010, the building was also home to CHUM FM sister station, CHUM AM, both during its time as CP24 Radio 1050 and briefly in 2010 during the first few months operating as TSN 1050. Now, CHUM AM is primarily based at the 9 Channel Nine Court complex in the Agincourt neighbourhood of Scarborough, so its radio programs can be simulcast on TSN's television network. ==References * Bell Media Category:Buildings and structures in Toronto Category:Bell Media Category:Radio studios in Canada ","title":"250 Richmond Street West"},{"id":"20202084","text":"Bassman may refer to: *Fender Bassman, bass amplifier *1st Bassman, album by Paul Chambers ==People== *Bassman (surname) ==See also== * Baseman (disambiguation), one of several fielding positions in softball and baseball ","title":"Bassman"},{"id":"20202096","text":"H√©ctor Alejandro Daniel Rivera (born May 17, 1952 in Rosario, Santa Fe) is an Argentine pianist settled in Italy.

The following month, the band toured North America as the main support act to Metallica on their World Magnetic Tour. The group met controversy when they were banned from playing at The Forum in Inglewood, California, where Metallica were booked for two dates.

The group announced shows in outlying cities in lieu of the ban. In February 2009, the band toured Europe; a number of the U.K. dates were part of a package tour sponsored by Metal Hammer dubbed \\"Defenders of the Faith\\" featuring Dimmu Borgir as co-headliners. The group then toured Australia through March as part of the Soundwave Festival, which was headlined by Nine Inch Nails and Alice in Chains. In April 2009, the group began a headlining North American tour, sponsored by No Fear Energy.http://music.ign.com/articles/945/945272p1.html The leg began in Phoenix, Arizona and wrapped up mid-May in North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.

Morton was replaced by Buz McGrath of Unearth for the remaining summer dates, and Doc Coyle of God Forbid for.the first three weeks of a fall North American leg. Morton eventually rejoined the group in October in Tampa, Florida. The show in Prague at Abaton on May 24, 2010 was the subject of manslaughter charges against vocalist Randy Blythe in 2012 and 2013.

The highway forms a portion of Interstate 80 Business within the city of Lovelock, and previously carried the alignment of former U.S. Route 40 and U.S. Route 95. ==Route description== View along SR 396 near the north edge of Lovelock looking northbound SR 396 in downtown Lovelock SR 396 begins at the West Lovelock interchange with Interstate 80 and U.S. Route 95. The route follows Cornell Avenue north into the center of the town. The highway crosses Main Street (SR 398) and continues along Cornell Avenue to its end at a five-point intersection with 14th Street, Airport Road (SR 856) and Upper Valley Road near the Lovelock city limits. Here, State Route 396 turns to follow Upper Valley Road. As the route heads northeast out of Lovelock, the surroundings become more rural in nature with open farmland on both sides of the highway. The highway also parallels the Union Pacific railroad tracks for some distance. Eventually, SR 396 turns east to intersect I-80 again at the Coal Canyon interchange, where the route terminates. The Cornell Avenue portion of State Route 396 also carries a portion of Lovelock's Interstate 80 Business Loop. The business route diverges from SR 396 at 14th Street, following Airport Road back to I-80. ==History== SR 396 was originally part of State Route 1 (SR 1). That route, designated with the passage of Nevada's first highway law in 1917, created a highway route across northern Nevada from California to Utah which passed through Lovelock. With the adoption of the U.S. Highway System in 1926, US 40 was eventually added concurrently with SR 1. With the advent of the Interstate Highway system, Interstate 80 (I-80) gradually replaced US 40 across northern Nevada and was removed from Lovelock by 1976. Also around this time, the Nevada Department of Transportation was beginning to renumber its highways, eliminating the State Route 1 designation and redesignating the Lovelock portion on Cornell Avenue and Upper Valley Road as State Route 396. Even though the cross-state designations of US 40 and SR 1 had been eliminated by the mid-1970s, construction of the Interstate 80 freeway in Lovelock was not started until 1981, so through traffic continued to use SR 396 in the city. ==Major intersectionsSee also== * * ==References== 396 Category:Transportation in Pershing County, Nevada Category:Interstate 80 Category:U.S. Route 40 Category:U.S. Route 95 ","title":"Nevada State Route 396"},{"id":"20202260","text":"Soo Line 2713 is an H-21 class 4-6-2 steam locomotive that was built for the Wisconsin Central Railway in May 1911.

Unlike most portrayals of exorcism and spirit possession in fiction, Apparitions is more religiously accurate and fact-based, incorporating the nature of demonic possession as described by the Church. It also recounts historical events associated with Christianity and other Abrahamic religions, which may have been caused (or directly influenced) by Heaven or Hell, indicating that the War described in the Bible may not have fully concluded. The series is written by Joe Ahearne. == Episodes  Episode 1 === In Rome, a meeting is being held at the Congregation for the Causes of Saints. Father Jacob, a London priest and investigator of miracles for the Congregation, has presented a case that may lead to Mother Teresa's canonization: Vimal, a young man who is currently training to enter the priesthood, was cured of leprosy (without antibiotics) after praying to Mother Teresa. Vimal was spontaneously cured when he was a child, just as Mother Teresa died, a miracle that has been offered as proof of her right to sainthood. But Vimal is soon visited by the apparition of a demon in the guise of a homeless man named Michael, and comes to realize that it was, in fact, demons who restored his flesh. He also feels that they are causing his homosexual thoughts. Meanwhile, a little girl named Donna approaches Father Jacob, claiming that her father, Liam, is possessed. When Father Jacob approaches the girl's father with a request to perform an exorcism, Liam violently rejects the suggestion. When he finally does agree‚Äîin order to keep Father Jacob from telling Social Services that he struck Donna in a fit of anger‚Äîthe event goes badly; the demons in Liam threaten and then attack Father Jacob, leaving the priest unconscious on the kitchen floor. Liam phones his daughter and convinces her to meet him that night. The demons' plans to defile her are thwarted when Father Jacob and Monsignor Vincenzo arrive to perform a full exorcism. As they begin, the demons tell Father Jacob that if he continues the exorcism, they will 'take back' the miracle they performed for Vimal. After Cardinal Bukovak rejects Vimal as a potential priest, the young man finds himself drawn to a men's bathhouse. While Vimal looks to finally satisfy his sexual urges, a possessed Michael appears and skins him alive. At the same time, Liam is freed of his possession by Jacob and Vincenzo, at the spot in Kensington Gardens where Donna was conceived at the exact moment of Mother Teresa's death.

The homeless man appears repeatedly, challenging Jacob to a kind of exorcism duel - they shall battle each other for supremacy and see who comes out on top, God or Lucifer. There are puzzles and clues that lead to some amalgam of the Holocaust, hell, heaven, the next Vatican exorcist, the usual stuff. This mystery leads Father Jacob into the past of Monsignor Vincenzo.

Cardinal Bukovak assigns Dr. Elaine Errison, an atheist psychologist, to assess Jacob. She believes that his religious beliefs (and Christianity) are a kind of mental illness. After being relieved of his duties, Jacob leaves the seminary and stays in a hotel where a mysterious woman tells him that anyone who attempts to exorcise him will be killed. With Jacob, Daniel and Ruth all reciting the prayer, Michael is vanquished, but in his final moments puts a bullet into Cardinal Bukovak, who is subsequently promoted for apparently attempting to defend the Pope.

These communities are described as working like one unit, meaning that every species plays an important part in the overall well-being of the ecosystem in which the community resides; much like the organelles within a cell, or even the cells making up one organism. Holistic communities have diffused boundaries and an independent species range. Co-evolution is likely to be found in communities structured after this model, as a result of the interdependence and high rates of interaction found among the different populations. Species compositions of communities change sharply at environmental edges (known as ecotones). ==Background== According to a widespread narrative, the ideas of a holistic ecological community were introduced by plant ecologist Frederic Clements in 1916, and countered by Henry Gleason in 1917, when he proposed the individualistic/open community concept (in applications to plants). However, this seems to be wrong in at least two essential respects: * The concept of mutualistic organismic ecological community might firstly have been introduced by Eugenius Warming, a botanist and the main founder of the scientific discipline of ecology, who introduced the term ‚Äúplantesamfund‚Äù, plant community (Warming 1895). At the beginning of the section ‚ÄúCommunal life of organism‚Äù of his later book ‚ÄúEcology of Plants‚Äù (Warming and Vahl 1909), Warming clearly emphasizes the importance of mutual dependence among coexisting species: ‚ÄúThe manifold, complex, mutual relations subsisting among organisms are matters of such profound import to plant-life and plant- communities that this Section of our book is set apart for their consideration‚Äù (ibid.: 82). ‚ÄúIn plant communities there is, it is true, often (or always) a certain natural dependence or reciprocal influence of many species upon one another; they give rise to definite organized units of a higher order‚Äù (ibid.: 95).Kirchhoff, T. (2020). The myth of Frederic Clements‚Äôs mutualistic organicism, or: on the necessity to distinguish different concepts of organicism. History and Philosophy of the Life Sciences, 42(2), article 24. * Undoubtedly, Clements compares plant communities with organisms and calls them ‚Äúcomplex organisms‚Äù and. later, ‚Äúsuper organisms‚Äù as well. \\"However, Clements‚Äôs theory does not include the assumption that mutual dependence is a principle of the organisation of plant communities. Rather, he interprets plant communities as top-down control-hierarchical entities, in which the subordinate species depend on dominant species ‚Äî but not the other way around. Therefore, his theory represents what may be called ‚Äòcontrol- hierarchical organicism‚Äô as against ‚Äòmutualistic organicism‚Äô.\\" While Warming might have been the first to propose an organismic theory of ecological communities, one of the first to elaborate such a theory has been the limnologist, zoologist and ecologist August Thienemann. According to Thienemann, a biocoenosis ‚Äúis not just an aggregate, a sum of organisms that coexist in the same biotope owing to alike exogenous habitat conditions but a (supra-individual) whole, a togetherness and a for-each-other of organisms‚Äù (Thienemann 1939: 275). He even assumes that the members of a biocoenosis feature ‚Äúspecific mutual relations that are vital for their life‚Äù (ibid.: 268), whereby this mutual ‚Äúbond either exists directly from organism to organism or operates indirectly by the medium of vitally created modifications of the physiographic conditions of the biotope‚Äù (Thienemann 1941: 105).For a more detailed discussion of Thienemann‚Äôs theory see Golley, F. B. (1993): A history of the ecosystem concept in ecology more than the sum of the parts. New Haven: Yale University Press: 38‚Äì41, 56; Potthast, T.

Neither organismic nor individualistic communities have been found to exist in nature in entirety, both are theoretical concepts that can be applied to empirical communities. For example, a community's composition can be better explained by holism than individualism, or vice versa. This ecological concept is based on the broader concept of holism, which describes the functionality of any system as having many individual parts, all of which are extremely important to the system's viability. \\"A community has been viewed as a super organism with integrity analogous to that of cells in an organism. This is the holistic or unitary view of a community, and one championed by Clements (1916). He regarded the community to be a highly integrated unit that operated very much within itself with little interaction with surrounding communities - a closed community.\\" \\"The holistic model considers all living beings as its subjects who are manifestations of the Absolute and part of the whole. It includes all relations that arise between them. The most efficient satisfaction of their interest is the most important designation of the holistic system (holistic community). The holistic community is equally responsible for the human development and for the harmonious evolution of all other subjects of holistic model. The subjects of holistic model are the following: * Humankind * Animals * Plants * Planet Earth * Extraterrestrial beings * Celestial bodies This characteristic illustrates that the holistic model is universal and exceeds just human relations. It is not just humanistic but also respectful for all life in general. The necessity to identify the subjects in the frame of the whole is the first condition for the proper satisfaction of their interests. Without differentiating them and without knowing well how they function, it is impossible to conduct rational action which aims to fulfil the needs of everyone in the system and to refine their environment.\\" ==See also== * Organicism * Organic unity * Systems ecology ==References * Holistic Community - Holistic Therapy Resources Category:Ecology ","title":"Holistic community"},{"id":"20202586","text":"Brae of Achnahaird (Achadh na h-√Äirde) is a small settlement at the head of Achnahaird Bay in Achiltibuie, Ullapool in Ross-shire, Scottish Highlands and is in the Scottish council area of Highland.

It is in oil on oak, and 83.8 x 65.4 cm. Rembrandt shows the episode of Jesus and the woman taken in adultery from the Gospel of Saint John. In this scene, a few Jews, mainly Scribes and Pharisees, tried to catch Jesus condoning disobedience to the Jewish Law, knowing that Jesus pitied wrong-doers. To do this, they produced a woman who had been caught taking part in adultery. Then, they said \\"Teacher, this woman has been caught in the act of adultery. Now in the law Moses commanded us to stone such. What do you say about her?\\" Jesus replied, \\"He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her\\" (John 8: 3-7). Rembrandt made Jesus appear taller than the other figures and more brightly lit. In contrast, the Jews are \\"in the dark\\" and appear lower. Symbolically, Jesus's height represents his moral superiority over those who attempted to trick him. == Painting materials == The painting was investigated by the scientists of the National Gallery London.Bomford, D. et al., Art in the making: Rembrandt, New edition, Yale University Press, 2006, pp. 126-131.

It is believed that hostilities among the inlanders of Malaita forced some people into the lagoon where over time they built their islands on sandbars after diving for coral. The religion of the island was based on prayers and offerings to the ghosts of dead ancestors, mediated by priests who kept their skulls and relics in tabu houses. Some ancestors were incarnated as sharks which protected their descendants. Langalanga is also the main source of the shell money now made in Solomon Islands. ==History== In Malaita legend, the first settlement on the island began around 3,000 BC at a place called Siale. The first places in the Malaita area to be settled were Dukwasi (Kwara'ae speaking people), and the Asi (man-made islands) namely: Aoke, Kaloka and Rarata in Langa Langa lagoon, Laulasi, Alite Koalia and Gwa'ata ‚Äì Ta'alulolo. It is also believed the early settlers originated from Mt. Kolovrat (Alasa'a), the highest peak on the main Malaita Island. The early settlers were believed to be castaways from the Alasa'a community. Some said they chose not to return to Alasa¬¥a because of the distance. It is an approximately two days walk. And the main reason why they came is to fish and in search for other sea foods in the island of Launasi meaning ¬¥'I'm stuck now known as Laulasi. From then they named the island Launasi in relation to the expression. After they had settled, other people began to arrive from different parts of Malaita and outside to settle in the Langalanga lagoon. They came from Small Malaita, Florida (Ngella), some came from the northern part of Guadalcanal believed to be from Longuvalasi area and others from the northern region of Malaita. Through inter-marriages, their descendants spread to the whole of the Langalanga lagoon. Certain cultural features or Tambu House (Place of the first settlements) are still preserved which attest to the settlement patterns that were made. Part 1 Documentary Video Part 2 Documentary Video ==1800 to 1900== In 1892 the Queensland government Australia abandoned the Pacific labour trade known as Blackbirding and in 1901 the Commonwealth of Australia enacted the Pacific Island Labourers Act 1901 which facilitated the deportation of Pacific Islanders that was the precursor to the White Australia policy. Britain was provided with a \\"plausible excuse for protecting the Solomons\\" and so protecting their labour reserves. By declaring a protectorate, the British were able to justify keeping out other colonial powers. In 1893 then Gibson of HMS Curacoa (1854) sailed around the islands to declare a protectorate with the only opposition by the Laulasi villages who refused the British flag. When Gibson asked why the flag was refused, the villages were afraid that their acceptance of it would signify to the bush people that by aligning themselves with Britain the lagoon dwellers were preparing for war and this would lead the bush people discontinuing trade with the lagoon people, who had no gardens and were dependent on food. ==1911 ‚Äì Author Jack London== American author Jack London travelled to Langa Langa in a yacht in 1908. > \\"We ran down the lagoon from Langa Langa, between mangrove swamps through > passages scaresly wider than the Monota, and passed the reef villages of > Kaloka and Auki.

Taken 2008 Historically, chiefs in the Langalanga lagoon are looked upon as very important in uniting communities. Normally, chiefs are chosen from chiefly tribes or clan. Villages in the past used to have threes chiefs, Fa'atabu who makes offering and communicated with the spirits and ancestors, the Ramo is responsible for tribal warfare and Waenotolo is the chief responsible for controlling, organising, leadership and uniting the whole community. Priests in Laulasi live in \\"spirit houses,\\" and when they die, their bodies are taken to the nearby village of Alite to decompose, after which the skulls are brought back and placed in a \\"house of skulls.\\" On the side of the island is an inlet where custom priests calls the sharks to come to the surface. The sharks are re- incarnation of the people's ancestors who died many years before. They also offer sacrifices to the sharks in the form of pigs. Ordinary men are not allowed to visit the shark site unless invited by the custom priest. According to local legend, a fisherman whose boat capsizes at sea may call on a shark to rescue him; after being rescued and returned to shore, he must sacrifice a pig, or else the shark will eat him next time he goes out to sea. By the 1960s many of the LangaLanga villages were Christian. Many of the communities previously sited on the artificial islands had been shifted to the mainland, with encouragement from the missionaries anxious to promote a clean break with the pagan past, and inducement in the form of greater access to land for subsistence farming. ==Last Pagan priest== In 1980, Moses Beogo who was the last Pagan priest (Fata'abu) on Laulasi and the last to perform the shark calling tradition, died. His skull is kept with the skulls of the other priests. ==Tourism== An \\"apartment\\" to store Priest Heads of another tribe. Taken 2008 Another \\"apartment\\" to store Priest Heads of one tribe. Taken 2008 A report on the British Solomon Islands dated 1972 states: > \\"where the traditional process of making shell money and other island > activities may be observed, once again proved popular with the tourists\\". In 1981 a symposium in the then U.S.S.R heard of Solomon Islands that: > \\"One of the more successful ventures in the tourist industry is Laulasi > Adventure Tours Ltd\\" In 1982 a research paper by the Australian National University claimed: > \\"Laulasi has become one of the notable tourist attractions of the South > Pacific ‚Äì with all the predictable consequences for the integrity of the > ancestral religion and the fabric of community social life. Moreover, the > expatriate entrepreneurs were Baha'is, and offered a ready-made religious > accommodation between ancestors and capitalism\\". In 1997 an author stated: > \\"Laulasi village, at the centre of the lagoon, makes a business of being > nice to visitors. A real business, because it charges more than a Disneyland > ticket to tread its man made shores\\". In 2006 The Last Heathen by Charles Montgomery concludes that for this he was expecting to find a volatile mixture of the tribal, pagan religion and Christianity. He found a comfortable hybrid instead, the two religions living in harmony. In November 2008 on an invitation from the Laulasi community a delegation from RAMSI was invited to attend to officiate the \\"re-opening\\" of the Laulasi Tourist Industry. Members took footage and photographs with a view of assisting with publicity. The delegation was escorted to the dock with a traditional war canoe trailing and a 10-seat war canoe leading with the latter being Laulasi women singing a traditional welcome song. On arrival at the dock, warriors confronted the delegation until a sum of shell money was presented to the warriors as a sign of peace. Once this gift was received the village girls offered the delegation refreshments. The men of the delegation were permitted to tour the three \\"apartments\\" that each represented a tribe. In each apartment, the skulls of past priests were laid atop one another. Once this tour concluded, the delegation was presented with a display of song and dance and formalities and a demonstration of the minting process of the shell money. The village women then sang as the delegation sailed away. ==Boatbuilding== The Annual Report on the British Solomon Islands dated 1953 states > \\"..a flourishing boat building industry has been established and cutters are > being built for the inter-island trade. A boatbuilding school has been > established. The shell money minting production line. Taken 2008 Cutting the shell with a sharp stone. Taken 2008 Drilling the hole with a traditional drill. Taken 2008 Beading the shells for the finished product. Taken 2008 Generally, the Lanagalanga people are very skilful boat builders. It can be said that it is unique to the constituency. In the early stages people used to build dingies. Later, with improvements in skills, they built what they referred to as 'CARTER BOATS' which is sharp at both ends. They used sails to travel around Malaita and to other Islands such as Gudalcanal and Isabel. Commercial boat building in the constituency started in the 1960s around the time when the Government established a boat building school in Auki. Mr. Frank Faulker who used to teach at the school and who now settled in Auki, is said to be the main person behind the success of the industry in Langalanga. ==Shell Money== The history of shell-money making in the langa langa lagoon is patchy. Stories retold from myths said that the first person to introduce shell money to the Langalanga lagoon was a woman from Buin in Bougainville. She was banish and floated in a coconut shell from Buin to Guadalcanal and finally to Malaita and landed at Tafilo a village at Lalana near Laulasi. Traditionally, there had been substantive trade between the Langalanga people and people from Buin in shell money until the emergence of the Bougainville crises. Most of the private ship owners from the constituency generated capital through shell money trade to build their ships. They took shell money to Buin and traded it for cash and used the cash to build wooden boats. As the production rate increased, shell resources were depleted, particularly in Langalanga lagoon. Even in the 1970s some types of shell were rare. Four different types of shell are used in making shell money, A red lipped rock oyster called Romu (chama pacifica), white shell known as Kee (Beguina semi-orbiculata), black horse mussel shells called Kurila (Atrina vexillum) and thick white disks from a rigid cockle known as Kakadu (Anadara granosa) What makes this money valuable are the purple disks, whose number per string is carefully calculated and which are made from the lips of the Romu shell which the Langa Langa people collect twice a year from the lagoon areas of the clan of the Lau tribe. The chief of the Lau clan allows them to fish for the shells in exchange for half the money strings. ==Notable people== * Bartholomew Ulufa'alu (25 December 1950 ‚Äì 25 May 2007) was the Prime Minister of the Solomon Islands from 27 August 1997 to 30 June 2000. ==See also== * Youtube video of Laulasi Island ==References== Category:Islands of the Solomon Islands Category:Anthropology Category:World War II sites in the Solomon Islands Category:History of the Solomon Islands Category:Exploration of Asia Category:Articles containing video clips ","title":"Laulasi Island"},{"id":"20202644","text":"Love People is the sixth album including Christmas with The Jets recorded with Liberty Park Records by the family group The Jets.

Aimed at global financial professionals, Bloomberg Markets publishes articles on the people and issues related to global financial markets. Bloomberg Markets, which is based in New York City, has readers in 147 countries. More than half of its readers live outside the U.S. As of December 2011, the magazine had a circulation of 375,000 and was available for sale at bookstores and selected newsstands. All subscribers of the Bloomberg Professional service and the Bloomberg Terminal also receive Bloomberg Markets as part of their subscription. Newsstand sales averaged 6,154 in 2010. ==History== Bloomberg Markets was launched in July 1992 as \\"Bloomberg: A Magazine for Bloomberg Users\\" and was originally intended to be a guide for the Bloomberg Professional service. Although every issue included instructions for navigating terminal functions, content also included articles about financial markets aimed at portfolio managers, corporate executives, brokers, bankers and securities traders. William Inman served as Bloomberg Markets founding editor. In 1999, the magazine became part of Bloomberg News and Ronald Henkoff became editor. Prior to joining Bloomberg Markets, Henkoff worked as a reporter and editor at Newsweek and Fortune. Henkoff was tapped by Bloomberg News chief Matt Winkler to bolster the magazine's feature writing, which had not been a focus of the publication. In 2000, the magazine's name was changed to Bloomberg Markets and became available on newsstands. In fall 2010, Bloomberg Markets was redesigned in an effort to attract a broader array of advertisers and expand its content. The redesign, led by Bloomberg Markets editor Ronald Henkoff and publisher Michael Dukmejian and developed by the firm of Priest + Grace, gave the publication a new, more contemporary look. In April 2011, Bloomberg Markets hired its first creative director, Siung Tjia, the former creative director of ESPN The Magazine. In addition to design changes, the editors added regular coverage of careers and personal finance following a global survey of readers. In addition to the redesign, Bloomberg Markets unveiled a trade advertising campaign to position itself as the leading publication for the \\"global financial elite\\" and increased its circulation rate base from 355,000 to 375,000 by December 2011. The campaign and shift in design lead to new advertising deals with luxury brands such as Range Rover, Goldman Sachs and Allianz. The ultimate goal, according to Dukmejian, is for Bloomberg Markets to reach a circulation of 450,000 with 15,000 on newsstands. In June 2011, Bloomberg Markets announced the launch of the 50 Most Influential franchise, its list of the most influential people in global finance, which appeared in the October 2011 issue. To coincide with the issue, the magazine hosted the inaugural Bloomberg Markets 50 Summit, a day- long event, held in September 2011 in New York City. A second 50 Most Influential ranking was published in the magazine's October 2012 issue. Bloomberg Markets would be testing a spin-off luxury title with a spring 2012 issue called Bloomberg Pursuits. In October 2015, it was announced by the parent company that Bloomberg Markets would reduce publication from 11 issues a year to six. ===Staff=== Bloomberg Markets has a staff of editors in the U.S., Latin America, Europe and Asia. In addition, the magazine draws on contributions from journalists at Bloomberg News, a global news service with 146 bureaus in 72 countries. ==Honors and awards== Bloomberg Markets has won almost 200 journalism and design awards including a Gerald Loeb Award, a Scripps Howard Award and a George Polk Award. In 1995, the magazine was a finalist for the National Magazine Awards in the General Excellence category for magazines with a circulation under 100,000. In 2006, editor Ron Henkoff won the Lawrence Minard Award as part of the Gerald Loeb Awards, which recognizes an editor whose career achievements and contributions to the profession of business, financial and economic journalism exemplify excellence in the area of editing. In 2011, Bloomberg Markets was named a finalist for the American Society of Magazine Editors' General Excellence Award for Finance, Technology and Lifestyle Magazines and Bloomberg Markets senior writer David Evans was named a Pulitzer Prize finalist in the National Reporting category. Evans also received the 2011 John Chancellor Award given by Columbia Journalism School. In 2012, Bloomberg Markets was made available in digital form for the iPad alongside its Businessweek subscription circulation. ==Notable stories and their impact== \\"Duping The Families of Fallen Soldiers\\" (September 2010) Following a six-month investigation, David Evans's article revealed that life insurance companies were withholding billions of dollars in benefits from the families of slain soldiers and millions of other Americans. As a result of the article, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs required that Prudential offer the families of slain soldiers the option of receiving one check for the full amount of the death benefit. Evans was named as a finalist for the 2011 Pulitzer Prize for his article. \\"Toxic Debt\\" (July 2007) This three-story cover package revealed the complicit role of rating companies Moody's and Standard and Poor's in creating the complex mortgage-backed securities stuffed with subprime debt that would trigger the global credit crisis. \\"Big Pharma's Shameful Secret\\" (December 2005) The article revealed that poorly supervised clinical trials for potential new drugs often injure and kill participants. As a result of the magazine's expose, the largest clinical trial company in the U.S. ousted its three top managers and government authorities shut down its biggest test center. \\"The Banks That Fleeced Alabama\\" (September 2005) Bloomberg Markets magazine reported that a group of banks led by JPMorgan Chase had overcharged Jefferson County, home to Birmingham, by at least $60 million in fees assessed on $5.8 billion in complex contracts called Interest-rate swaps that the county used to finance a sewer system. In October 2009, former Birmingham Mayor Larry Langford was convicted of taking bribes to steer a share of the JPMorgan deals to a local bank. As a result of the corruption, in November 2011, Jefferson County filed the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history. ==References * Other provider for bloomberg markets magazine subscription Category:Business magazines published in the United States Category:Monthly magazines published in the United States Markets Category:Magazines established in 1992 ","title":"Bloomberg Markets"},{"id":"20202686","text":"Tripura Industrial Development Corporation or TIDC is a state Industrial Development Corporation in the state of Tripura, India. ==History== The Tripura Industrial Development Corporation Limited (TIDC) was established in 1974 as a Private Limited Company under the company's act 1956.

Continuing the tradition of his family (he claims to follow the example set by Clementianus), he edited a manuscript containing the first ten books of Livy' Ab urbe condita, initially corrected by some Victorinus, then bought by Quintus Aurelius Symmachus, and finally emended by Nichomachus before arriving into the hands of Dexter; all of the manuscripts of the first ten books of Livy's Ab Urbe condita that were subsequently copied through the Middle Ages into modern times are derived by this single manuscript, thanks to whom those books have survived.

After several years of hockey in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and New York, Check was signed by the Montreal Canadiens after a season playing with the Quebec Senior Hockey League in 1943. In his first NHL season, he played only one professional game, with the Red Wings in 1944. Check was then loaned to the Black Hawks, where he played 26 games in his final NHL season. The Canadiens then renewed his contract and sent him to the Ottawa \\"Senior\\" Senators of the Quebec Senior Hockey League, where he spent the last six seasons of his career. Check was a part of two Allan Cup-winning teams, in 1944 and 1949, and became a sales representative in later life. He died on May 11, 2009 in Ottawa, Ontario at the age of 90. ==Early life== Check was born in Brandon, Manitoba on May 22, 1918. Alongside Frank Stahan, Check played two seasons from 1936 through 1938 with the Brandon Wheat Kings of the Manitoba Junior Hockey League. He played two seasons for the Regina Aces (later renamed the Regina Vic-Aces) of the Saskatchewan Senior Hockey League from 1938 through 1940 before deciding to continue his career at the professional level. At the peak of his career, Check stood five feet, ten inches tall and weighed 165 pounds. ==Hockey career== After these teams Check, a left winger, spent a season with the New York Rovers of the Eastern Amateur Hockey League. Although the team finished last, he nevertheless was responsible for 21 goals and 20 assists. This was followed by a year with the Sydney Millionaires of the Cape Breton Senior Hockey League, producing 29 goals and 22 assists. During the 1942‚Äì1943 season, Check was signed by the National Hockey League's Montreal Canadiens, although he continued to play for the Quebec Aces of the Quebec Senior Hockey League through 1944, scoring for them a total of 60 goals and 40 assists. His only NHL game during this period was played with the Detroit Red Wings on March 11, 1944, when the Canadiens provided him as an emergency injury replacement, and he did not score any points. Check did, however, win his first Allan Cup while playing with the Aces, defeating the Port Arthur Shipbuilders in 1944. For the 1944-1945 season, he was loaned to the Chicago Black Hawks, playing 26 games and scoring six goals and two assists. Check spent the rest of his career with the Ottawa \\"Senior\\" Senators of the QSHL, after having his contract re-purchased by the Canadiens and being loaned out. He competed in the Allan Cup twice more. In 1948 his team lost to the Edmonton Eskimos, but captured the championship in 1949 after facing off against the Regina Capitals. In six seasons with the Senators, he scored a total of 81 goals and 84 assists, placing him among the top ten league scorers four times. He retired after the 1950‚Äì1951 season. ==Later life== After his hockey career, Check worked as a sales representative for the Hiram Walker distillery for over 30 years. He kept many friends from his hockey days in his later years, including Leo Gravelle, Emile Dagenais, Billy Robinson, Eddie Emberg and Larry Regan. Check died on May 11, 2009 at the age of 90 in Ottawa, Ontario. At the time of his death, he was one of the last surviving players from Ottawa's last Allan Cup championship team, the Senior Senators of 1949. ==References * Category:1918 births Category:2009 deaths Category:Canadian ice hockey left wingers Category:Chicago Blackhawks players Category:Detroit Red Wings players Category:New York Rovers players Category:Sportspeople from Brandon, Manitoba Category:Canadian expatriate ice hockey players in the United States ","title":"Lude Check"},{"id":"20202752","text":"Whihala Beach is located on Lake Michigan.

The show is hosted by Steve Valentine, and produced by Endemol USA. The first season aired on the Sci-Fi Channel from November 12 to December 17 of 2008, and has also aired on USA Network and Chiller. ==Premise== Seven strangers from across the United States arrive at a large, mysterious mansion. The mansion's eccentric owner (Steve Valentine) spends his free time stashing his assets throughout the mansion, and he is assisted by his silent butler, the eighty-year-old maniacal freak, Rupert.Lowry, Brian. \\"Estate of Panic Review\\" Variety. 12 November 2008. Retrieved March 5, 2009. Once the players arrive at the estate, The owner challenges them to find the cash he has hidden in a series of rooms. The task is made difficult, however, as the contestants must come face to face with their greatest phobias while in the house. In each room, the last person to leave and the person who collects the least money are both eliminated. After three rooms are explored and six players have been eliminated, the final contestant earns the opportunity to win (and add to) everything collected by all players by completing a final challenge in the estate's Vault. ==GameplayMain game=== The game is similar in concept to several other shows such as Fear Factor (also produced by Endemol), the Nickelodeon game show Finders Keepers, the French game show Fort Boyard, the British game show The Crystal Maze, and the GSN game show How Much Is Enough? The seven contestants search through a series of three rooms for cash. Bills of smaller denominations ($1, $5, etc.) are hidden in relatively easy locations in the rooms, or even placed out in plain sight; bills of larger denominations (up to $100) are hidden in areas that are either more difficult to reach or protected by various animals (snakes, crabs, spiders, maggots, insects, etc.), all of which are harmless, yet disturbing. Meanwhile, each room takes on a life of its own to make things trickier and scarier for the contestants. For example, the basement floods with water; the study has moving walls and ceiling that \\"shrink\\" the room to a very small size; the floor in the kitchen has properties similar to quicksand, and the garden is rigged with electric fences. Once a contestant believes that he or she has enough money to secure a spot in the next round, the player must leave the room and place all cash collected on a tray held by Rupert. Not all exits remain open the entire time, however, and a contestant might either have to wait for an exit to unlock or take an alternate route to make it out of the room in time. Elimination While there is no explicitly-stated time limit in any of the rooms, the rooms become more uninhabitable as time passes and the number of players shrinks, forcing the players to consider when to exit. In each round, the last player left in the room is eliminated; the show claims that the contestant is \\"trapped\\" inside once all the others have exited. In addition: of the contestants who did exit, the one who recovered the least money is also eliminated and escorted from the house by the butler. Should there be a tie for last place, both players advance, but the two players with the least money in the next room are eliminated in addition to the trapped player. There is no reward for recovering the most money in the first room, but the person who does so in the second room usually receives assistance that may prove useful in the third room. The total money recovered by all eliminated contestants is placed in a cumulative pot, which is then offered as a prize to the last remaining contestant. Extras At times, a monetary bonus is offered to a contestant who can retrieve a certain object or set of objects hidden in one of the rooms. Depending on the object, it could either help or hinder the player's actual progress in the room: carrying some objects around could impede the player's progress, while setting them down would put them at risk of being stolen, with the others have the ability grab the rest without letting go. Other hidden objects could be worn to protect the player against some unwanted distraction(s) in the room (i.e. Rubber soled slippers, to protect against electric shocks). ===The Vault=== The last remaining contestant is given the chance to win all the money recovered by all seven contestants, plus more, in the Vault. The contestant is restrained (such as by a leg chain, a harness suspended from the ceiling, or a straitjacket) in a vault containing 200 \\"safety deposit boxes.\\" Some boxes contain cash, while others have worthless items or booby traps such as snakes; a few boxes contain tools the contestant can use to free himself from the restraint. In some versions, the player must recover the prize winnings as well. Unlike the previous rooms, the Vault features a time limit: ten steel balls roll at intervals through a \\"timing device.\\" Once eight balls have finished dropping, red lights begin flashing to warn the contestant; when all ten have finished dropping, the door locks. If the contestant exits the Vault before the door locks, he or she wins all the money collected that night, plus any money recovered from the Vault. If the door locks, he/she loses all of the money. As a last resort, the contestant can choose to \\"panic,\\" pressing a button in the corner of the vault to summon Valentine to the rescue. Alternatively, if the contestant cannot physically reach the button, he/she may shout out, \\"I'm panicking,\\" to the same effect; in earlier episodes, Valentine told the contestant to do both. A contestant who panics forfeits any money collected in the vault as well as half of the money collected in the first three rooms. While not specifically stated, it is implied that if the player tries to cheat by removing a ball, he/she will be disqualified. If the contestant makes it out of the Vault, the host states how much money they got and Steve tells them to leave by saying\\"Get out of my house\\" after Steve tells the contestant to leave Steve wil then walk away to another room and the contestant leaves the house get in the car and leaves the mansion with their money . ==Production== Estate of Panic is filmed on an estate in Argentina, although some challenges are filmed in a studio because, according to Valentine, \\"the scope of the challenges is so ambitious and huge that there were times when we couldn't really destroy that person's house.\\"Halterman, Jim. \\"INTERVIEW: STEVE VALENTINE, RICHARD HALL PUT \\"ESTATE OF PANIC\\" INTO SCI FI\\" The Futon Critic.

Get Out of My House  Chad, Debbie, Eben, Jessica, Jill, Lee, Zondra  Room 1: A basement that floods from a never- ending torrent from \\"busted\\" pipes; snakes. Last in room: Jill Bottom two: Debbie and Zondra Least money: Debbie Room 2: A garden surrounded with electric wires, the shocks of which grew in intensity as time went on. Players also could not wear socks or shoes during this round. Last in room: Jessica Bottom two: Eben and Zondra Least money: Eben Most money: Chad Room 3: A study constructed to have its walls and ceiling close in, crushing furniture as the space in the room grew smaller. For winning the previous round, Chad won a screwdriver, which could be used to remove the vent covers, which concealed more money, but he simply used his hands. Last in room: Lee Least money: Zondra Winner: Chad Vault: Chad had one leg shackled to a chain on the floor that limited his range of movement to just short of the door. He had to either find a key or use some of the tools available in the safe deposit boxes to cut himself free; he found a saw, a wrench, and a crowbar, and used the crowbar to break the wooden pedestal off the floor. Chad escaped the vault, winning $28,511 for the evening. - 2. That Sinking Feeling  Adrienne, Cassandra, Deanne, Joey, Royce, Serena, Ted  Room 1: A crawl space containing snakes and tarantulas in some straw. Also hidden in the crawl space were two halves of a painting (which Valentine claimed was a painting of Rupert's parents). Only one player could bring it out, and needed both halves; the player bringing out both halves of the painting won a $1,000 bonus towards his or her score for the room. Last in room: Serena Bottom two: Adrienne and Cassandra Least money: Cassandra Bonus: Deanne (won another half of the painting with a quick rock, paper, scissors contest.) Room 2: A kitchen containing maggoty food. The floor was actually a non-Newtonian fluid into which the contestants would sink if they did not move quickly. Last in room: Deanne Bottom two: Adrienne and Ted Least money: Adrienne Most money: Royce Room 3: The sewers underneath the mansion. Some routes contained dead ends. For winning the previous round, Royce was allowed to wear rubber gloves on his hands. Last in room: Joey Least money: Ted Winner: Royce Vault: Royce was suspended from the ceiling with his feet just barely touching the ground. He either had to find cutting tools to cut himself down, or find a way to grab a loop above his head to be freed instantly. Royce escaped the vault, winning $26,849 for the evening. - 3. Shocked and Dismayed  Andy, Brian, Chris, David, Kristen, Miriam, Nikki  Room 1: An electrical room covered in a web of shock wires, similar to the garden in the first episode; halfway through, the lights would periodically go out, further distracting the players and preventing them from seeing the wires. Also hidden in the room was a pair of slippers; only one player could bring them out, and could also wear them to lessen the effect of the electrical shocks; the player bringing out both slippers won a $1,000 bonus towards his or her score for the room. Last in room: Brian Bottom two: Kristen and Nikki Least money: Kristen Bonus: David Room 2: A wine cellar with spikes that appeared out of the wall and snakes in the barrels; eventually the walls themselves closed in on the contestants. Last in room: Chris Bottom two: Miriam and Andy Least money: Miriam Most money: David Room 3: A refrigerated room filled with ice blocks, ice sculptures, and a deep freeze containing ice cream novelties with cash hidden inside of them. Halfway through the round it began to snow; money also fell with the snow. For winning the previous round, David was allowed to wear gloves on his hands. Last in room: Nikki Least money: Andy Winner: David Vault: David's leg was chained to the floor as in the first episode, but his arms were also handcuffed to long chains extending from two of the deposit boxes. He had to free himself from the floor with hidden tools and also find the key to unshackle himself from the cuffs. David could not set himself free from the ankle chain and panicked, winning just under $13,000 of the near $26,000 found that evening. - 4. A Raw Deal  Adrian, Chioma, Chris, Courtney, Michael, Ron, Sharon  Room 1: A trash compactor filled with garbage and worms, among which the cash was buried. As the round progressed, a garbage chute spewed more sludge as well as money; the compactor was also activated at points to close the walls in on the contestants. In addition, a mask was buried in the trash; the contestant who found it earned an additional $1,000. Last in room:Courtney Bottom two: Chioma and Ron Least money: Ron Bonus: Adrian (keeps it secret by hiding it and asking if anyone saw it.) Room 2: A meat locker shielded in total darkness (though the audience is able to see, thanks to infrared cameras), with rotten fruit and more garbage strewn across the floor; halfway through, the lights came on briefly, giving the contestants a glimpse into what they were actually touching. The carcasses and garbage concealed money, as well as things cut to feel like money to fool the contestants, such as lettuce, newspaper, and other paper products; there were also dummy \\"carcasses\\" containing bricks instead of money to further confuse the players. Last in room: Sharon Bottom two: Chris and Chioma Least money: Chris Most money: Adrian Room 3: A series of giant gopher holes forming a maze of tunnels; as the contestants ventured through the space, additional dirt (as well as money) fell from the ceiling and piled up on and around the contestants. For winning the previous round, Adrian was given knee pads to make it easier to maneuver throughout the tunnels. Last in room: Chioma Least money: Adrian Winner: Michael Vault: Michael was shackled to the floor; however this time the key to get out was located in a safe next to him. The safe was held shut by a combination lock, the combination numbers of which were hidden in three separate deposit boxes in the room. Michael had to retrieve the numbers, place them in the correct order, and unlock the lock to obtain the key to unshackle himself. Michael escaped, earning $31,181 for the night. - 5. Don't Burst My Bubble Alex, Bonnie, James, Jenileigh, Jordan, Maya, Nancy Room 1: Egyptian- themed room filled with artifacts and sarcophagi containing cash, as well as insects, tarantulas, scorpions, and \\"water snakes\\". Once underway, sand began pouring from the ceiling, burying the money and making it harder for the contestants to move about. There are also rubies hidden in the room, which were worth $200 each if found. No other gems would generate bonus money, as shown when Bonnie brought a count out of the room. Last in room: Alex Bottom two: Bonnie, Maya Least money: Tied; both Bonnie and Maya advanced. Room 2: \\"Steve's childhood bedroom\\" filled with toys, balloons and party favors. Giant balloons on the wall filled with air and exploded at random times, spreading confetti and cash all over the room. For that reason, players were given safety glasses for this room. Last in room: Jordan Bottom three: Bonnie, Maya, Nancy Least money: Maya, Nancy Most money: Jenileigh Room 3: The three contestants were put into the storm drains, a maze of pipes with many dead ends. In addition, it was raining, causing large amounts of water to flow through the drain at random times. For winning the previous round, Jenileigh was given a plastic bag, which she used as additional storage space for her money. Last in room: Bonnie Least money: Jenileigh Winner: James Vault: All of the winnings from the evening were placed inside a safe in the vault, while James was tied to a chair in the middle of the room; he had to cut himself free from the chair, find the combination to open the safe, place the night's winnings and any other money he found back into the bag they were kept in (which was also left in the room), and escape. The combination to the safe was the number of jewels inside each of three numbered velvet bags hidden in the Vault (each bag was numbered, so the number of jewels in the bag labeled #1 would be the first number in the combination, etc.); the jewels themselves were worth $50 each if they were brought out along with the money. The combination was shown to be 46-15-82, for a total of 143 jewels, thus $7,150. James escaped the vault, winning $36,652 for the evening. - 6. A Grave Situation  Chris, Janet, JoAnn, Kaleti, Milo, Ruby, Tenille  Room 1: The estate's attic, which was cluttered with old knick- knacks, cobwebs, and tarantulas. Also in the attic was a hidden compartment that contained cash but also featured a door that closed behind the contestant, trapping him inside until a good amount of force was used to open the door. Inside the room was an urn worth a $1,000 bonus to the person that found it. Last in room: Tenille Bottom two: Janet, Ruby Least money: Ruby Bonus: Chris Room 2: A trophy room, which partway through the round began flooding with mud that spewed from behind the room's pictures and from some of the mounted animal heads. Some of the treasure boxes in the room contained large snakes; others required keys to open, which were hung in giant clusters on the wall. Unlike previous episodes, the special advantage was not given to the player that collected the most money in the round; instead, it was given to the contestant who found a \\"guardian angel\\" statue hidden in the room. Last in room: Kaleti Bottom two: JoAnn and Janet were called out, but neither had the least money. Least money: Chris Bonus: Milo Room 3: The estate's graveyard, which contained coffins in various states of burial, some filled with crabs and/or garbage; a mausoleum filled with money; one particularly deep coffin that could be used to trap the player(s) who went for its contents (Milo entered and was trapped by JoAnn, but forced his way out); and guard dogs to intimidate the players. For finding the hidden bonus in the previous round, Milo received a 10-second head start. Last in room: Janet Least money: JoAnn Winner: Milo Vault: Milo was locked inside a straitjacket with only one hand (and very little arm movement) available to open doors. Milo had to find the key located in one of the deposit boxes and free himself from the straitjacket before escaping the vault. Milo escaped, winning $26,095 for the evening. } ==Reaction== Brian Lowry in Variety praised host Valentine's \\"macabre charm\\" but stated the show overall is a \\"parade of silly stunts and contests\\" which becomes \\"mostly an ordeal for viewers.\\" ==References * Category:Syfy original programming Category:2000s American reality television series Category:2008 American television series debuts Category:2008 American television series endings Category:Television series by Endemol ","title":"Estate of Panic"},{"id":"20202819","text":"The Skyland Camp-Bowman Lake Ranger Station in Glacier National Park was originally built as the Culver Boys' Military Academy.

The main cabin, known as \\"Rainbow Lodge\\" was built by the boys of the academy in 1920 from red cedar logs, and is more elaborate and carefully detailed than typical ranger stations of this period. The interior is dominated by a stone fireplace. The camp was originally owned by the Culver Military Academy of Culver, Indiana, which operated the camp as a concession within the park, on the shore of Bowman Lake. It operated for a few seasons, but poor management caused the National Park Service to terminate the camp's contract.

He also played first-class cricket for the Tasmanian cricket team in his younger years, dismissing Donald Bradman in the 1935 season. ==Cricket career== The Tasmanian team that played the South Africans at Hobart in January 1932. Rex Townley is standing third from left. As Tasmania didn't compete in the Sheffield Shield at the time of his cricketing career, Townley's appearances for his state were limited to matches against touring sides such as the Marylebone Cricket Club and South Africa as well as out of season first-class fixtures against other Australian states. A legbreak bowler, Townley took 36 wickets at 35.52 in first-class matches. His claim to fame as a cricketer was dismissing Donald Bradman, caught and bowled for 369, in a first-class match against South Australia, the legendary batsman's second highest ever score at that level. He also claimed in his career the wickets of English Test cricketer Ernest Tyldesley and South African Test player Bruce Mitchell. ==Political career== Like his younger brother Athol, the Australian Minister for Defence from 1958 to 1963, Townley went into politics. He joined the Tasmanian House of Assembly at the 1946 election as an Independent, representing Denison. The Liberal Party installed Townley as their leader for the 1950 election but lost to incumbent Premier Robert Cosgrove, despite achieving a 9.8% swing. With the Liberals regaining two seats which had been held by Independents since 1948, Labor stayed in power only thanks to the support of the remaining Independent, Bill Wedd. Townley also led the Liberals into the 1955 election and picked up a seat to leave the House of Assembly with a deadlock as both parties had 15 seats out of a possible 30 in the assembly. Cosgrove however remained as Premier of Tasmania. On 30 June 1965, Townley resigned from parliament, having never failed to defend his seat in an election. ==See also== * List of Tasmanian representative cricketers ==References *Cricinfo: Reginald Townley * Rex Townley at Cricket Archive *The Parliament of Tasmania from 1856 (Rex Townley) Category:1904 births Category:1982 deaths Category:Australian cricketers Category:Tasmania cricketers Category:Liberal Party of Australia members of the Parliament of Tasmania Category:Members of the Tasmanian House of Assembly Category:Australian sportsperson-politicians Category:Leaders of the Opposition in Tasmania Category:20th-century Australian politicians ","title":"Rex Townley"},{"id":"20202851","text":"A map of Langa Langa lagoon, Malaita, Solomon Islands. Laulasi Island. Note the man-made walls. The sacred area is located to the right of the island. Taken 2008 Langa Langa Lagoon or Akwalaafu is a natural lagoon on the West coast of Malaita near the provincial capital Auki within the Solomon Islands. The lagoon is 21 km in length and just under 1 km wide. The \\"lagoon people\\" or \\"salt water people\\" live on small artificial islands built up on sand bars over time where they were forced to flee from the headhunters of mainland Malaita. The islands in the lagoon are renowned for their shell money minting process, their \\"shark worship\\" beliefs, their shipbuilding skills and tourism. The most popular and well known of this islands is Laulasi which has had a thriving tourism industry dating back to the early 1970s; although tourism is largely underdeveloped. The Langa Langa Lagoon provides opportunities for snorkeling, and the villagers provide shell making demonstrations.\\"Matthew Prowse blog . 18 June 2014. Retrieved 22 March 2015. == Etymology == Langa in Solomons Pijin language means \\"along\\" or long. ==History== In Malaita legend, the first settlement on the island began around 3,000 BC at a place called Siale. The first places in the Malaita area to be settled were Dukwasi (Kwara'ae speaking people), and the Asi (man-made islands) namely: Aoke, Kaloka and Rarata in Langa Langa lagoon, Laulasi, Alite Koalia and Gwa'ata ‚Äì Ta'alulolo. It is also believed the early settlers originated from Mt. Kolovrat (Alasa'a),the highest peak on the main Malaita Island. The early settlers were believed to be castaways from the Alasa'a community. They said, the people were forced out from the community because of bad behaviour and disrespect for custom and traditional way of living. During their journey the final stopover was at Laulasi where they felt it was safe from enemies. After they had settled, other people began to arrive from different parts of Malaita and outside to settle in the Langalanga lagoon. They came from Small Malaita, Florida (Ngella), some came from the northern part of Guadalcanal believed to be from Longuvalasi area and others from the northern region of Malaita. Through inter-marriages, their descendants spread to the whole of the Langalanga lagoon. Certain cultural features or Tambu House (Place of the first settlements) are still preserved which attest to the settlement patterns that were made. ===1800 to 1900=== From the 1870s to 1903 Malaitan men (and some women) comprised the largest number of Solomon Islander participants in the indentured labour trade to Queensland, Australia and to Fiji. The 1870s were a time of illegal recruiting practices known as Blackbirding. Malaitans are known to have volunteered as indentured labourers with some making their second trip to work on plantations, although the labour system remained exploitative. In 1901 the Commonwealth of Australia enacted the Pacific Island Labourers Act 1901 which facilitated the deportation of Pacific Islanders that was the precursor to the White Australia policy. However many islanders remained and formed the South Sea Islander community of Australia. In 1893 then Gibson of HMS Curacoa (1854) sailed around the islands to declare a protectorate with the only opposition by the Laulasi villagers who refused the British flag. When Gibson asked why the flag was refused, the villages were afraid that their acceptance of it would signify to the bush people that by aligning themselves with Britain the lagoon dwellers were preparing for war and this would lead the bush people discontinuing trade with the lagoon people, who had no gardens and were dependent on food. Britain was provided with a \\"plausible excuse for protecting the Solomons\\" and so protecting their labour reserves. By declaring a protectorate, the British were able to justify keeping out other colonial powers. ===1911 ‚Äì Author Jack London=== American author Jack London traveled to Langa Langa in a yacht in 1908. > \\"We ran down the lagoon from Langa Langa, between mangrove swamps through > passages scaresly wider than the Monota, and passed the reef villages of > Kaloka and Auki.

The LangaLanga/Wala and Kwara'ae people more or less have the same cultural and traditional practices and follow the same chiefly system. Male children for example are more valued than females because they will continue with the line or tribe. Girls are not so preferred because they leave the community when they get married. Boys are separated from their parents when they are around 12 or 13 years old to live separate in the men's houses. Around that age, they are taught by the fathers basic important skills such as fishing, building houses, making canoes or cutting and sewing sago palm leaves. Girls on the other hand, they stay with their mother and taught household cores such as cooking, weeding around the house, cleaning and looking after their younger brothers of sisters. One of the important things that girls learn at an early age too is how to make shell money. Historically, chiefs in the Langalanga lagoon are looked upon as very important in uniting communities. Normally, chiefs are chosen from chiefly tribes or clan. Villages in the past used to have threes chiefs, Fa'atabu who makes offering and communicated with the spirits and ancestors, the Ramo is responsible for tribal warfare and Waenotolo is the chief responsible for controlling, organising, leadership and uniting the whole community. Priests in Laulasi live in \\"spirit houses,\\" and when they die, their bodies are taken to the nearby village of Alite to decompose, after which the skulls are brought back and placed in a \\"house of skulls.\\" On one side of the island is an inlet where custom priests calls the sharks to come to the surface. The sharks are re-incarnation of the people's ancestors who died many years before. They also offer sacrifices to the sharks in the form of pigs. Ordinary men are not allowed to visit the shark site unless invited by the custom priest. According to local legend, a fisherman whose boat capsizes at sea may call on a shark to rescue him; after being rescued and returned to shore, he must sacrifice a pig, or else the shark will eat him next time he goes out to sea. By the 1960s many of the LangaLanga villages were Christian. Many of the communities previously sited on the artificial islands had been shifted to the mainland, with encouragement from the missionaries anxious to promote a clean break with the pagan past, and inducement in the form of greater access to land for subsistence farming. == Economy == The shell money minting production line, 2008 Cutting the shell with a sharp stone, 2008 Traditionally, there had been substantive trade between the Langalanga people and people from Buin (Bougainville) in shell money until the emergence of the Bougainville crisis. Most of the private ship owners from the constituency generated capital through shell money trade to build their ships. They took shell money to Buin and traded it for cash and used the cash to build wooden boats. Until recently, it has been a driving business which can be conservatively valued at $50,000.00 to $100,000.00 per annum. Shell money products include bracelets, necklaces, Tafuliae, Ha'a (smaller beads shell money used in some parts of the country), ear rings, finger ring, 'head bands' etc. At present, unfortunately, the industry is slowly declining due to input scarcity. The major supplier of raw material South Malaita is not willing to supply any more shells. The only supplier which still sell raw materials to Langalanga people is Western Province although not reliable and in very small quantity. Drilling the hole with a traditional drill, 2008 Beading the shells for the finished product, 2008 ==Shell money== The history of shell-money making in the Langa Langa lagoon is patchy. Stories retold from myths said that the first person to introduce shell money to the Langalanga lagoon was a woman from Buin in Bougainville. She was banished and floated in a coconut shell from Buin to Guadalcanal and finally to Malaita and landed at Tafilo, a village at Lalana near Laulasi. As the production rate increased, shell resources were depleted, particularly in Langalanga lagoon. Even in the 1970s some types of shell were rare. The limited land available for agriculture, has the consequence that the production of shell money is a continuing source of income. The creation of shell money is also an important cultural symbol to the people of the Langalanga lagoon. Four different types of shell are used in making shell money, A red lipped rock oyster known as \\"romu\\" (Chama pacifica in the family Chamidae), white shell known as \\"ke'e\\" (Beguina semiorbiculata in the Carditidae), black horse mussel shells called \\"kurila\\" (Atrina vexillum in the Pinnidae) and thick white disks from a rigid cockle known as \\"kakadu\\" or\\"kakandu\\" (Anadara granosa in the Arcidae) ==Boatbuilding== The Annual Report on the British Solomon Islands dated 1953 states > \\"..a flourishing boat building industry has been established and cutters are > being built for the inter-island trade. A boatbuilding school has been > established. Generally, the Lanagalanga people are very skilful boat builders. It can be said that it is unique to the constituency. In the early stages people used to build dingies. Later, with improvements in skills, they built what they referred to as \\"Carter boats\\" which are sharp at both ends. They used sails to travel around Malaita and to other Islands such as Guadalcanal and Isabel. Commercial boat building in the constituency started in the 1960s around the time when the Government established a boat building school in Auki. Mr. Frank Faulker who used to teach at the school and who now settled in Auki, is said to be the main person behind the success of the industry in Langalanga. ==Fishing practices== The people of Langalanga developed fishing practices for the lagoon and the ocean with the fishing usually done from a canoe. A common method is angling, that was formerly carried out using lure hooks made of shell shanks or with baited hooks made of bone or shell. In the lagoon the fishing practices included spearing, netting, and collecting marine invertebrates, including by diving. Some traditional fishing practices have been abandoned include using fish traps (afeafe and ere‚Äôere), the fish-drive (rarabu) using coconut leaves, fish-poisoning, kite-fishing (kwaferao), and angling with a straight hook (lana). ==See also== * Youtube video of Laulasi Island ==References== Category:Islands of the Solomon Islands Category:World War II sites in the Solomon Islands Category:Headhunting Category:History of the Solomon Islands Category:Exploration of Asia ","title":"Langa Langa Lagoon"},{"id":"20202866","text":"Cherokee is a small town situated in the Macedon Ranges Shire, in Victoria, Australia north of the state capital, Melbourne.

The venue was staged in July 1938 at the city's ', later renamed \\"\\", following the trademark grandiose style of the Nazi Sports Body. This highly nationalistic sports event was officially commemorating the 125th anniversary of the historical German Wars of Liberation against Napoleon and the first award of the Iron Cross in the city of Breslau itself in 1813. It was staged as a grand patriotic, expansionist occasion, illustrating the clamor for a Greater Germany to the public. This event gathered German athletes brought from many different parts of the world, like Argentina, South West Africa, Italy, the US and South Africa. It also became a gathering of representatives of German ethnic minorities, mainly from Eastern Europe (Siebenb√ºrgen, Banat) who staged processions dressed in their colorful folkloric costumes, a display of the Nazi Drang nach Osten policies.Ethnic groups from Siebenb√ºrgen in procession Not only sports competitions and athletes' parades took place, but also numerous military, civil, and folklorical-costume processions in the mains streets of the city of Breslau. ==Symbolism of the event== The Deutsches Turn- und Sportfest was a highly political event, attended by many high-ranking Nazi officials. The event was presided over by Reichssportf√ºhrer (NSRL leader) Hans von Tschammer und Osten and the patron of the festival, Reich minister of the interior Wilhelm Frick. Adolf Hitler and other high-ranking personalities of the Third Reich attended the inaugural venue of the games. During this occasion Hitler gave a speech from the balcony of Hotel Monopol in Breslau.Wratislavia-net The event and its celebration of Germanism, as well as the choice of Dr. Wilhelm Frick to lead it, was part of the creation of a war- preparation atmosphere by the Nazi state. Minister of the Interior Frick was the spearheader of Germany's rearmament in violation of the Versailles Treaty. His inaugural speech was full of war symbolism, setting the mood for the events that would culminate the following year with the invasion of nearby Poland, then just a few miles to the east of Breslau. Viciously attacked and fanatically defended, the city of Breslau would suffer much destruction towards the end of World War II.Sportfest 1938 ==Commemorative editions== The Post Office of the Reich issued special stamps and postcards to mark the occasion of the 1939 Breslau Games. Volk in Leibes√ºbungen (A people into Physical Exercise), a lavishly illustrated commemorative book on the Sportfest was published in Berlin the same year on behalf of the Reichssportf√ºhrer Hans von Tschammer und Osten.

Designed by theater architect Thomas W. Lamb, the Capitol originally had a searing capacity of 5,230 and opened October 24, 1919. After 1924 the flagship theatre of the Loews Theatres chain, the Capitol was known as the premiere site of many Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) films. The Capitol was also noted for presenting live musical revues and many jazz and swing bands on its stage. ==History== The Capitol was one of the first of the large lavish movie theaters that dominated the film exhibition business for the next 40 years, built by Messmore Kendall as one of New York‚Äôs first cinema palaces, through his realty company, Moredall Realty Company. It opened on October 24, 1919 with the New York premiere of United Artists' first production, His Majesty, the American. The theater was acquired in 1924 by the entertainment magnate Marcus Loew and became the flagship of his deluxe Loew's Theatres chain. The Capitol was the frequent site of the world premieres of films made by the Loew's-owned Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studio. The Wizard of Oz (1939) had its first New York run at the theatre. Jerry Lewis started as an usher at the theatre. After having been converted for the presentation of Cinerama wide screen films in 1964, the theater's last engagement was MGM's 2001: A Space Odyssey, which opened on April 3, 1968. The Capitol closed September 16, 1968 with a live all-star benefit featuring Bob Hope and Johnny Carson. The theatre was replaced by the Uris Building (now Paramount Plaza) office tower. ==Radio== Airing for the first time in November 1922, The Capitol Theatre Family Show was a 45‚Äì60 minute program broadcast Mondays on the NBC Blue Network March 7, 1927 ‚Äì July 27, 1931.Hickerson, Jay.

In 1925, he began arranging orchestral and small ensemble pieces for the Capitol's radio program on WEAF, which became the flagship station of the NBC Red Network in 1926. Beginning in 1926, the series of light classical concerts titled Capitol Theatre was broadcast by the NBC Red Network on Sunday evenings from 7:20pm to 9:15pm.

He reigned circa 899‚Äì911. His territories included Central Java, East Java, and Bali. In 907 he created the Mantyasih inscription (also known as Balitung's charter), containing the list of Medang kings. He also mentioned in Kaladi inscription (c. 909 CE). == Rise to power == Historians such as Boechari and Poerbatjaraka argued that Dyah Balitung became the king as a result of his marriage to the daughter of his predecessor. It was speculated that his predecessor and his father-in-law is Rakai Watuhumalang, who according to the stele of Mantyasih ruled before Balitung. However, the reason Balitung inherited the kingdom may not be that of marrying the King's daughter, since he also had a son, Mpu Daksa, according to the stele of Telahap. An alternative explanation could be that after Rakai Kayuwangi's death, the kingdom was broken. This is confirmed with Maharaja Rakai Gurunwangi's stele of Munggu Antan and Rakai Limus Dyah Dewendra's stele of Poh Dulur. It has been suggested that Dyah Balitung became a hero by defeating Rakai Gurunwangi and Rakai Limus, and thus uniting the divided kingdoms. As a result, the people elected Balitung as King in favour of his brother-in-law, Mpu Daksa. == Reign == During his rule, the palace was moved to Poh Pitu area and named Yawapura. It has been suggested that this is because the former palace, Mamratipura, built by Rakai Pikatan, was badly damaged as a result of war between Rakai Kayuwangi and Rakai Gurunwangi. The oldest stele under the name of Balitung is the stele of Telahap, dated 11 September 899. However, it is possible he ascended the throne before 899. The next stele is Watukura, dated 27 July 902. This is the oldest stele that mentions the existence of the position of Rakryan Kanuruhan (Prime Minister). Meanwhile, the position of Rakryan Mapatih in Balitung's era is equivalent that of a crown prince, held by Mpu Daksa. The stele of Telang, dated 11 January 904, mentions the development of a complex named Paparahuan, led by Rakai Welar Mpu Sudarsana, located on the verge of the Bengawan Solo river. Balitung freed the villages in Paparahuan and its surroundings from tax, and forbid the local inhabitants to collect payment from people who crossed the river. The stele of Poh (17 July 905) states that the village of Poh was freed from tax in return for taking care of Sang Hyang Caitya and Silunglung, properties of the previous ruler Rakai Pikatan, the grandfather of Mpu Daksa and Balitung's consort. The stele of Kubu-Kubu (17 October 905) describes the gift given to Rakryan Hujung Dyah Mangarak and Rakryan Matuha Dyah Majawuntan in form of a village, Kubu-Kubu, as they both conquered the Bantan area. Historians speculate that Bantan might be an alternative name to Bali. Bantan means \\"sacrifice\\", while Bali means \\"offering\\". The stele of Mantyasih (11 April 907) describes the gift given to five junior ' because they kept the peace during Balitung's wedding. Also mentioned in this stele is the previous ruler of the kingdom before Balitung. In 907, Balitung offered the village of Rukam to his grandmother, Rakryan Sanjiwana. == The end of an era == The accession of Balitung as king may have caused the previous king's son, Mpu Daksa, to become jealous. During the rule of his brother-in-law, Mpu Daksa held the position of Rakai Hino as described in a stele dated 21 December 910 about the partition of the Taji Gunung area between him and Rakai Gurunwangi. According to the stele of Plaosan, Rakai Gurunwangi is rumoured to be the son of Rakai Pikatan. Historians speculate that Rakai Gurunwangi allied himself with Mpu Daksa, his nephew, as they are the son and grandson of Rakai Pikatan. The historian Boechari is certain that the rule of Balitung ended as a result of Mpu Daksa's rebellion. According to the stele of Taji Gunung (910), Daksa was still as Rakai Hino, while by the stele of Timbangan Wungkal (913), he had already ascended the throne as king. == References == * Marwati Poesponegoro & Nugroho Notosusanto. 1990.

Retrieved 11-05-2009. is practiced throughout West Africa (especially in Nigeria and Ghana) and other African countries and beyond, symbolizing the conclusion of a harvest and the beginning of the next work cycle. The celebration is a very culturally based occasion, tying individual Igbo communities together as essentially agrarian and dependent on yam, the king of crops. == Igbo tradition == Yams are the first crop to be harvested, and are the most important crop of the region. The New Yam Festival is therefore a celebration depicting the prominence of yam in the social-cultural life of Igbo people. The evening prior to the day of the festival, all old yams (from the previous year's crop) are consumed or discarded. The next day, only dishes of yam are served at the feast, as the festival is symbolic of the abundance of the produce. Though the style and methods may differ from one community to the next, the essential components that make up the festival remain the same. In some communities the celebration lasts a whole day, while in many places it may last a week or more. These festivities normally include a variety of entertainments and ceremony, including the performance of rites by the Igwe (King), or the eldest man, and cultural dances by Igbo men, women, and their children. The festival features Igbo cultural activities in the form of contemporary shows, masquerade dances, and fashion parades. == ·ªäwa-ji ceremony == Usually at the beginning of the festival, the yams are offered to the gods and ancestors first before distributing them to the villagers. The ritual is performed either by the oldest man in the community or by the king or eminent title holder. This man also offers the yams to God, deities and ancestors by showing gratitude to God for his protection and kindness in leading them from lean periods to the time of bountiful harvest without deaths resulting from hunger. After the prayer of thanksgiving to God, they eat the first yam because It is believed that their position bestows the privilege of being intermediaries between their communities and the gods of the land. The rituals are meant to express the gratitude of the community to the gods for making the harvest possible, and they are widely followed despite more modern changes due to the influence of Christianity in the area. This therefore explains the three aspect of Igbo worldview, that they are pragmatic, religious and appreciative. The day is symbolic of enjoyment after the cultivation season, and the plenty is shared with friends and well-wishers. A variety of festivities mark the eating of new yam. Folk dances, masquerades, parades, and parties create an experience that some participants characterize as \\"art\\"; the colorful festival is a spectacle of exhibited joy, thanks, and community display. Palm oil (mman·ª• nri) is used to eat the yam. Iwa ji also shares some similarities with the Asian Mid-Autumn Festival, as both are based on the cycles of the moon and are essentially community harvest festivals. This event is important event in the calendar of Igbo people all over the world. The harvest of yam and the celebration of the God of the land through the New Yam festival is an epitome of the people‚Äôs religious belief in the supreme deity. The coming of the new moon in the month of August marks the preparation for the great ‚ÄúIri Ji Ohu‚Äù festival, but the time and mode of preparation differs from community to community. The New Yam festival is a highly captivating art event. The colourful festival is a visual spectacle of coherence, of dance, of joy and feasting, an annual display for community members, to mark the end of the cultivation season, a festival where the people express their gratitude to those that helped them reap a bountiful harvest.

Dirk I van Brederode, also called Dirk van Teylingen, built the Brederode castle. During the Protestant Reformation the Van Brederode family left Holland and their properties were confiscated by the government.

Several members have played leading roles in politics for many generations. King Louis XIV elevated the family to the French nobility and referred to them as \\"princes of the Maronites\\" in many letters. Pope Clement X made them Counts Palatine. Most of the Lebanese Khazen branch is Maronite, while some other branches are Greek Orthodox and Muslim but are not related to the Mount-Lebanese, which were endowed with these honors. ==History== The Khazen Cheikhs can trace back their lineage to the 9th century, when they were mainly located between Houran, Damascus, Baalbeck, and Nablus. They started buying and acquiring lands in Mount Lebanon during the 15th century and, more specifically, first in Jaj (currently in Byblos District). They continued their exodus to the Keserwan district, where they bought lands from the Shi'a tribes. This caused the Shi'a to move towards what is known today as the South of Lebanon and the Maronites to the Keserwan district. In 1584, the Khazen were able to hide the princes Fakhreddine and Youn√®s in Ballouneh. At that time, their father, cornered by the Ottoman's army and losing the fight against them, informed his wife Sitt Nossab to send his sons to the Khazen, a powerful and influential family at that time. The great Fakhreddine, when he took power, was greatly influenced by the Khazen family politically and religiously. In return, he granted them the title of Cheikh and complete political influence and control of Mount Lebanon.2004 Maronite Synod, The Maronite Church and Politics, ¬ß 10 & 11\\\\. Quote: \\"When the Ottoman state became displeased with the emirs of the ‚ÄòAssaf family and with their aides from the Hobeish family, they endeavored to gradually eliminate them, replacing them with the princes of the Bani Sayfa family. The latter, too, were from the Turkmen tribes, brought in by the Ottoman state to protect the shores. However, they used to rule according to the Shari‚Äôa, and not according to civil convention. During that period, the Maronite migration toward the southern regions of Mount Lebanon coincided with their contact with Rome and the West through the Franciscan missionaries and other Christian organizations working in the Holy Land. They soon started a new partnership, first with the Ma‚Äôan family and prince Fakhreddin, through the Khazen family and, in a second stage, with the Abi-l-Lama‚Äô family. Fakhreddin aspired to gain independence from the Ottoman Empire and wished to be open to the West. ... During that period, harmony was complete, not just between the Maronite Church and the Lebanese Emirate with the different confessions and beliefs of the princes, but also between the Church and the new Maronite leadership, such as the Hobeish and Khazen families, among others. These were, unlike the Mouqaddams, very zealous for the interests of the Church.\\" Similarly, the Khazen also gave shelter to Prince Haidar Shehab's sons, in Keserwan in the early 18th century.Antoine Khoury Harb, The Maronites: History and Constants, p. 116. Quote: \\"When Prince Ahmad Maan died, the Shehabs, relatives of the Maan, took over. When the regent Prince Bashir I passed away in 1706, Prince Haidar reigned, and moved the seat of the emirate from Hasbaya to Deir el- Qamar. The Ottoman Wali of Sidon deposed the Shehabi Prince and replaced him by the leader of the Yamani party, Prince Yussef Alam - Eddin. Haidar fled with his two sons and some of his followers to Ghazir in Kisrawan where his allies, the Khazen and Hobeish families from the Qaysi party, were in control. When the army of Prince Yussef Alam-Eddin conquered and burnt Ghazir, Haidar left his sons in Kisrawan and took refuge in Hermel. The sheikhs of the Khazen family offered hiding-places to the prince's family.\\" The Khazen families, who were now controlling the Keserwan district, were very influential within the Maronite Church. This is due to their financial support of the Church and their assistance in its expansion by the construction of many monasteries, several of which they still own today, as well as their connections to the French.Matti Moosa, The Maronites in History, p. 283. Quote: \\"We have also seen earlier that the Maronite community had been placed under the protection of France and that the French kings began to choose their consuls from among the Maronite dignitaries. Through the power and prestige of France the consuls then exercised authority over the Maronite Church and its clergy. The Maronites were so proud to be under the protection of France that some Maronites called themselves, 'the French of the East.' Thus, through France, the Shihabi amirs, who will be discussed shortly, realized the importance of Maronite rule and power, and they and the Maronites became united in a common interest. In 1697, Amir Ahmad died without an heir, and the Druze notables chose his nephew Bashir al-Shihabi as their new ruler. He was succeeded in 1707 by the young Amir Haydar al-Shihabi, grandson of Amir Ahmad al-Ma'ni. Haydar recognized the authority of the Maronite al-Khazins and the Hubayshis of Kisrawan and Ghazir and treated these two families as equal to the feudalistic Druze families.\\" They also offered lands and, most importantly, supplied security to the Church and the Maronite community overall. In 1656, Cheikh Abou Nawfal received a Papal decoration for his help in the expansion of the Maronite faith in Mount Lebanon. The family was consulted on each patriarchal election and controlled episcopal nominations for three Maronite archbishoprics‚Äîrepresenting the districts of Aleppo, Baalbeck, and Damascus‚Äîuntil the 19th century.Richard Van Leeuwen, Notables and Clergy in Mount Lebanon: The KhƒÅzin Sheikhs and the Maronite Church (1736-1840), p. 103-104. Quote: \\"The influence of the KhƒÅzin sheiks in clerical matters concentrated on two aspects, which were, as far as the clergy were concerned, closely interrelated: the nomination of prelates and the founding and administration of clerical and monastic possessions. Traditionally, the main Maronite nobles were consulted on the occasion of the election of the patriarch. ... Eventually, the three main branches of the KhƒÅzin family acquired the privilege of selecting the mutrƒÅns of the dioceses of Aleppo (awlƒÅd Abƒ´ Nasƒ´f), Baalbek (awlƒÅd Abƒ´ QƒÅnsawh), and Damascus (awlƒÅd Abƒ´ Nawfal). This privilege was acknowledged by Patriarch Ya'q≈´b 'AwwƒÅd. It is, therefore, evident that the KhƒÅzin sheiks also interfered in dioceses which officially had no connection with their administrative territory, an indication that they saw their role in church matters as an extension of their political power within the community as a whole.\\" (Text also available here.)Farid el-Khazen, The Breakdown of the State in Lebanon, 1967-1976, p. 35. Quote: \\"By the mid-19th century, the church and its monastic orders were present in various areas of the Mountain. Its power had surpassed that of the lordly Maronite families, notably the Khazen family, on which it had previously depended for protection and support. 'By the end of the 18th century,' writes Iliya Harik, the 'church had become the largest, the most organized, and the wealthiest organization in the whole of Mount Lebanon.' It established educational institutions in various parts of the Mountain and had an educated and active clergy. By the time the Mutasarrifiyya was established, the Maronite Patriarch emerged as the de facto central political figure in Mount Lebanon.\\" There were three important and influential patriarchs from the Khazen family: Youssef Dargham (1733‚Äì1742), Toubia (1756‚Äì1766) and Youssef Ragi (1845‚Äì1854). Several bishops have also shared the name, including Michel (Caesarea, 1767-1786), Ignace (Nablus, 1787-1819), Germanos (Damascus, 1794-1806), Estefan (Damascus, 1806-1830), Anton (Baalbeck, 1807-1858), Estefan (Damascus, 1848-1868), Louis Joseph (Ptolemais, 1919-1933), and Georges Abou (Rusadus, 2014-current). In 1858, Tanios Chahine started a rebellion against the Khazen family, which caused a great loss to their dominance over Kerserwan. The rebellion was a result of a power struggle between the Abi Lamaa family, the English, the French, the Ottomans, and particular Khazen who wanted to increase their influence.William Harris, Lebanon: A History, 600-2011, p. 162. Quote: \\"After 1860, France and Britain converged in protecting their stakes in the empire against Russian encroachment. French defeat by Prussia in 1870 made France more risk averse. French interest in Maronite clerical turf struggles with governors waned; indeed, France was the chief architect of the eventual competitor of the church -- the elected administrative council. France was schizophrenic in upholding both the Ottomans and its own influence in Mount Lebanon and Syria. Davud Pasha, an Armenian Catholic, developed fruitful relations with foreign consuls and strong local commitment. These were assets in resuscitating the local secular elite. In the Kisrawan, Davud reconciled the Khazen sheikhs and the peasants, the former retrieving much of their property and the latter mollified with tax and land concessions.\\" After these events, the Khazen stayed involved in politics, yet their work as one family holding ultimate Maronite power has diminished greatly. The Khazen crest which includes a snowy part of the mountain and cedar trees, reflects the family's special closeness to the country, and especially to Mount Lebanon. The Khazen Crest (image). There are multiple branches of the family. The 2 main branches are based in Ajaltoun, which mainly traces its origins from Nawfal Abou Nassif el-Khazen (son of Nader Abou Nawfal el-Khazen), and Ghosta, which mainly traces its origins from Fayad Abou Kanso el-Khazen (son of Nader Abou Nawfal; also, consul of France).Khazen Genealogical Tree. See Nader Abou Nawfal and his list of children. Kfardebian, which is nearby, also has a sizable branch as well as Achqout and Jounieh. ==Today== In modern times, Khazen have always represented Keserwan with at least one MP in the Lebanese Parliament.

The object was initially announced in 2008 and confirmed as real in 2012 from images taken with the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) on the Hubble Space Telescope and, according to calculations reported in January 2013, has a 1,700-year, highly elliptical orbit. It has a periastron of 7.4 billion km (~50 AU) and an apastron of about 44 billion km (~300 AU). As of May 25, 2013 it is 110 AU from its parent star. The true nature of Fomalhaut b is the subject of significant debate. Fomalhaut b was initially identified as one of the first exoplanets to be directly imaged: its detection was attributed to reflected light from circumplanetary material (e.g. a dust ring) and thermal emission from a jovian planet atmosphere. Fomalhaut b has subsequently been described as a low-mass planet whose surrounding dust cloud is entirely responsible for its detection or, most recently, debris from a collision of asteroids instead. The object was one of those selected by the International Astronomical Union as part of their public process for giving proper names to exoplanets.NameExoWorlds: An IAU Worldwide Contest to Name Exoplanets and their Host Stars. IAU.org. 9 July 2014NameExoWorlds . The process involved public nomination and voting for the new name.NameExoWorlds. In December 2015, the IAU announced the winning name was Dagon.Final Results of NameExoWorlds Public Vote Released, International Astronomical Union, 15 December 2015. The name Dagon was proposed by Dr. Todd Vaccaro and forwarded by the St. Cloud State University Planetarium to the IAU for consideration. Dagon was a Semitic deity, often represented as half-man, half-fish. ==Summary== The nature of Fomalhaut b is unclear. On one hand, Fomalhaut b could be a planet less than twice Jupiter's mass that is either enshrouded in a spherical cloud of dust from ongoing planetesimal collisions or surrounded by a large circumplanetary ring system, either of which are responsible for scattering the primary star's light and thus making Fomalhaut b visible. Alternatively, it could be a conglomeration of rubble from a recent collision between comet-to-asteroid-sized bodies, and not actually a planet.. Fomalhaut b and three companions around HR 8799, whose discovery was announced simultaneously, were described as the first directly imaged extrasolar planets (among earlier claims such as e.g. 2M1207 b, GQ Lup b, DH Tau b, AB Pic b, CHXR 73 b, UScoCTIO 108 b, CT Cha b, 1RXS 1609 b) in that their emission was thought to originate at least in part from a planetary atmosphere. However, subsequent studies from the Spitzer Space Telescope and a reanalysis of the original HST data instead suggest that Fomalhaut b's light is scattered starlight, not planet thermal emission. == Initial discovery by Hubble == Comparison between the Solar System and the system around Fomalhaut The existence of a massive planet orbiting Fomalhaut was first inferred from Hubble observations published in 2005 that resolved the structure of Fomalhaut's massive, cold debris disk (or dust belt/ring). The belt is not centered on the star, and has a sharper inner boundary than would normally be expected. A massive planet on a wide orbit but located interior to this debris ring could clear out parent bodies and dust in its vicinity, leaving the ring appearing to have a sharp inner edge and making it appear offset from the star. In May 2008, Paul Kalas, James Graham and their collaborators identified Fomalhaut b from Hubble/ACS images taken in 2004 and 2006 at visible wavelengths (i.e. 0.6 and 0.8 Œºm). NASA released the composite discovery photograph on November 13, 2008, coinciding with the publication of Kalas et al. discovery in Science. Kalas remarked, \\"It's a profound and overwhelming experience to lay eyes on a planet never before seen. I nearly had a heart attack at the end of May when I confirmed that Fomalhaut b orbits its parent star.\\" In the image, the bright outer oval band is the dust ring, while the features inside of this band represent noise from scattered starlight. == Early follow-up observations and doubts == In the discovery paper, Kalas and collaborators suggested that Fomalhaut b's emission originates from two sources: from circumplanetary dust scattering starlight and from planet thermal emission. Here, the former explains most of the 0.6 Œºm brightness and planet thermal emission contributes to much of the 0.8 Œºm brightness. Their non-detections with ground-based infrared data suggested that Fomalhaut b had to be less massive than about 3 Jupiter masses. However, Fomalhaut b should be detectable in space-based infrared data if its mass is between 1-3 Jupiter masses. But sensitive infrared Spitzer Space Telescope observations failed to detect Fomalhaut b, implying that Fomalhaut b has less than 1 Jupiter mass. Furthermore, although the planet was thought to be a plausible explanation for Fomalhaut's eccentric debris ring, measurements in the Kalas et al. paper hinted that it was moving too fast (i.e. not apsidally aligned) for this explanation to work. Finally, researchers analyzing September‚ÄìOctober 2011 Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) data for Fomalhaut's debris ring suggested an alternate hypothesis: that the ring could be shaped by much smaller, shepherding planets, neither of which needed to be Fomalhaut b. These results invoked skepticism about Fomalhaut b's status as an extrasolar planet. ==Recovery, independent confirmation by Hubble and further additional findings== On October 24, 2012, a team led by Thayne Currie at the University of Toronto announced the first independent recovery of Fomalhaut b and revived the claim that Fomalhaut b identifies a planet. They reanalyzed the original Hubble data using new, more powerful algorithms for separating planet light from starlight and confirmed that Fomalhaut b does exist. They also provided a new detection of Fomalhaut b at 0.4 ¬µm. They modeled the optical detections and infrared upper limits for Fomalhaut b, showing that Fomalhaut b's emission can be completely explained by starlight scattered by small dust and arguing that this dust surrounds an unseen planetary-mass object. Thus, they consider Fomalhaut b to plausibly be a \\"planet identified from direct imaging\\" even if Fomalhaut b is not, strictly speaking, a directly imaged planet insofar as the light does not come from a planetary atmosphere. A second paper made public a day later and led by Raphael Galicher and Christian Marois at the Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics also independently recovered Fomalhaut b and confirmed the new 0.4 ¬µm detection, claiming the spectral energy distribution (SED) of Fomalhaut b cannot be explained as due to direct or scattered radiation from a massive planet. They considered two models to explain the SED: (1) a large circumplanetary disk around a massive, but unseen, planet and (2) the aftermath of a collision during the past 100 years of two Kuiper belt objects of radii about 50 km. Subsequent Hubble data obtained in 2010 and 2012 with the STIS instrument by Paul Kalas and collaborators again recovered Fomalhaut b. However, analysis of Fomalhaut b's astrometry showed that the object has a high eccentricity (e = 0.8), its orbit (projected on the sky) crosses the plane of Fomalhaut's debris ring, and thus it is unlikely to be the object sculpting the debris ring's sharp inner edge. Fomalhaut b's high eccentricity may be evidence for a significant dynamical interaction with a hitherto unseen planet at a smaller orbital separation. Analyses of additional STIS data obtained in 2013 and 2014 argue that Fomalhaut b is fading and expanding in size, a behavior that may support the interpretation of Fomalhaut b as a collision between two asteroid-sized objects. The revival of the claim that Fomalhaut b is (possibly) a planet after it had been discounted led some to nickname the object a \\"zombie planet\\", although this is a non-technical term used in press material and does not appear in any peer-reviewed manuscript. == Physical characteristics == Assuming that Fomalhaut b's orbit is in the same plane as the debris disk located exterior to it, it orbits Fomalhaut at a distance of approximately . This distance is about closer to the star than the inner edge of the debris disk. The orbital separation of Fomalhaut b is larger than that for directly imaged planets around Œ≤ Pictoris and HR 8799 (8‚Äì70 AU). Fomalhaut b appears to be moving at about 4 kilometers per second. While it is unclear whether Fomalhaut b's orbit will make it cross the debris disk or cross the debris disk only in projection (i.e. it is not orbiting in the same plane as the disk), its orbit is not completely nested within the debris disk. At the optical wavelengths at which Fomalhaut b is detected, it is only about 2.7√ó10‚àí10 times as bright as the star and is the faintest (intrinsically) extrasolar object yet imaged. The shape of its spectrum, as determined from measurements obtained at 0.4 to 0.8 Œºm, appears similar to that of its host star, suggesting that the emission identifying Fomalhaut b is completely due to scattered starlight. Although the initial discovery paper for Fomalhaut b suggested that its optical brightness may be variable due to planetary accretion, later reanalyses of these data fail to find convincing evidence that Fomalhaut b is indeed variable, thus eliminating evidence for planetary accretion. However, longer-term monitoring of Fomalhaut b may show evidence that the object is fading with time. In order for Fomalhaut b to be detectable at optical wavelengths, it must have an emitting area much larger than the physical size of a planet, a fact further strengthening the case that what we see as Fomalhaut b is not light coming from a planetary atmosphere. A circumplanetary ring system is large enough to scatter enough starlight to make Fomalhaut b visible only if it has a radius between 20 and 40 times that of Jupiter's radius. A spherical cloud of dust with a radius of can make Fomalhaut b visible. Fomalhaut b appears as an unresolved point source in the highest-quality data (at 0.6 Œºm) which would suggest that its projected emitting area cannot be larger than about 0.25 AU, about 1/4th of the Earth‚ÄìSun distance. However, it may be resolved at slightly longer wavelengths and in the most recently analyzed HST data, which would indicate that its emitting area is larger. The mass of Fomalhaut b, if a planet, is highly uncertain. Infrared non-detections suggest that Fomalhaut b cannot be more massive than 2 times Jupiter's mass but a lower limit on the mass depends on uncertain details for the nature of Fomalhaut b, its circumplanetary environment, and the existence of other planetary-mass bodies in the system. Models of Fomalhaut b sculpting the star's debris disk give a mass 0.5 times that of Jupiter. Models for Fomalhaut b assuming it is surrounded by a swarm of planetesimals imply that it could be much lower mass (10‚Äì100 times the mass of Earth). If Fomalhaut b is instead one of two shepherding planets that together confine the debris disk into a narrow ring, it could be anywhere between several times the mass of Mars to slightly more massive than Earth. If Fomalhaut b is a gas giant like Jupiter or Saturn, it probably formed several million years after the host star itself was formed, making it roughly 450 million years old. Alternatively, if it is a transient dust cloud it must be extremely young, perhaps having formed within the last few centuries. == Other planets orbiting Fomalhaut == Fomalhaut b is orbiting its host star at a wide separation, where forming massive planets is difficult. To explain its current location, Fomalhaut b could have been dynamically scattered by a more massive, unseen body located at smaller separations. Several ground-based observations have searched for this hypothetical Fomalhaut \\"c\\" but have yet to find it. At very small, Solar- System-like scales any additional companions must have a mass less than thirteen times the mass of Jupiter. At slightly wider scales comparable to the locations of planets around HR 8799, any additional planets must have masses below about 2 to 7 Jupiter masses. Fomalhaut b could have formed in situ if it coalesced from small pebble-sized objects that rapidly formed into a protoplanetary core which in turn accreted a gaseous envelope. ==Gallery== File:Fomalhaut with Disk Ring and extrasolar planet b.jpgFomalhaut b's position in 2004 and 2006 (ACS) File:Fomalhaut planet.jpgArtistic rendition of Fomalhaut b as a planet which revolves around its parent star File:Fomalhaut-artist-impression-heic2006a.jpgVisualisation of Fomalhaut and Fomalhaut b (artist's impression) == See also == * Direct imaging of extrasolar planets * List of extrasolar planets * List of star systems within 25‚Äì30 light-years == References  External links == *Hubblecast 22: Hubble directly observes planet orbiting Fomalhaut *Preprint of recovery/confirmation paper *Preprint of discovery paper *Preprint of prediction paper *NASA's Hubble reveals rogue planetary orbit for Fomalhaut b Category:Exoplanets Category:Exoplanets discovered in 2008 Category:Giant planets Category:Piscis Austrinus Category:Exoplanets detected by direct imaging Category:Exoplanets with proper names ","title":"Fomalhaut b"},{"id":"20203742","text":"The Coal Creek Patrol Cabin in Glacier National Park, Montana, is a rustic backcountry log cabin.

The cabin is notable for its original roof construction, which consisted of peeled logs laid along the pitch of the roof, culminating in a log ridgepole. The added weight was borne by double log purlins, one on top of the other. The configuration was apparently intended to protect against deadfalls, falling trees or branches. The logs were replaced by shingles in the 1940s and by metal in the 1960s. While the Paola ranger station was abandoned in 1932, as well as the Nyack station, the Coal Creek cabin is maintained and used by trail maintenance crews. ==References== Category:Ranger stations in Glacier National Park (U.S.) Category:Park buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Montana Category:Houses completed in 1925 Category:Government buildings completed in 1925 Category:Log cabins in the United States Category:Buildings and structures in Flathead County, Montana Category:National Register of Historic Places in Flathead County, Montana Category:Log buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Montana Category:1925 establishments in Montana Category:National Register of Historic Places in Glacier National Park Category:National Park Service rustic in Montana ","title":"Coal Creek Patrol Cabin"},{"id":"20203765","text":"Barry Leiba (born 1957) is a computer scientist and software researcher.

He was credited by the school with 96 knockdown blocks, which were the most ever by a Baylor offensive lineman. Smith gave up 3¬Ω sacks and was penalized five times. With Baylor running a spread offense since the arrival of new head coach Art Briles, Smith was usually in a two-point stance for pass protection, which caused NFL scouts to question his run blocking ability. ===College awards and honors=== *2008 First-team All-Big 12 *2008 Associated Press and Rivals.com Third-team All- American *2008 Football Writers Association of America All-American *2008 Pro Football Weekly honorable mention All-American ==Professional career2009 NFL Draft=== At the 2009 NFL Combine, Smith recorded the 11th-fastest 40-yard dash (5.09 seconds), tied for the fourth-most repetitions in the bench press (33), and was sixth in the three-cone drill (7.53 seconds) among all offensive linemen who participated.

Perrin This Union Pacific Railroad locomotive was built by Taunton in July 1868. The Taunton Locomotive Manufacturing Company was one of the earliest firms in the United States established especially for the manufacture of steam locomotives. Located in Taunton, Massachusetts, the company was organized in 1849 and incorporated the following year by William A. Crocker, Willard W. Fairbanks, William R. Lee and their associates.History of Bristol County, Hurd, 1883 Their first engine, the Rough and Ready was delivered in May 1849.Taunton Locomotive Manufacturing Company ==Company history== Willard W. Fairbanks was a machinist who had worked in Providence, Rhode Island building stationary and marine engines. The company's first engine was built from castings and plans prepared by George S. Griggs, who had been associated with the Boston & Providence Railroad, one of the earliest railroads in New England, which began operation in 1849.John H. White, Jr., American Locomotives - An Engineering History, 1830-1880; p.322 The company's shops were located on Wales Street just west of downtown Taunton along what was then the Taunton Branch Railroad, and later part of the Old Colony Railroad's vast system in Southeastern Massachusetts. In 1852 the company faced new competition from their neighbor across the tracks, the Mason Machine Works, a successful Taunton textile machine company, that decided to enter the locomotive-building trade.Arthur W. Wallace, Mason Steam Locomotives, (Forest Park, IL: Heimberger House Publishing Co., 2004), pp. 13-15, 18 and 44. By 1860, Taunton Locomotive had produced almost 300 engines.John H. White Jr., American Locomotive Builders in the Steam Era, (Self-published, 1982), p. 97. In 1861, Harrison Tweed would take over control the company from Fairbanks, and lead it through perhaps its most productive period. He was succeeded by Parley I. Perrin (P.I. Perrin) in about 1871. Perrin began as a machinist had joined the company in 1846 as a forman and draftsman, and worked his way up through the leadership ranks.History of Taunton, Massachusetts, 1893, Emery By 1877, Taunton Locomotive had its 675th locomotive. However, by then the company lagged far behind the larger locomotive builders of the time, such as Baldwin and Schenectady. The engines of Taunton, and the other New England locomotive builders were considered obsolete compared to these larger establishments. In 1883, the locomotive works established the Huber Printing Press Company to supplement its dwindling locomotive business. That same year, Nahum Stetson became president, after the death of Samuel L. Crocker.Representative men and old families of southeastern Massachusetts; J.H. Beers & Co., 1912; page 259 The last locomotive produced by Taunton Locomotive was built in 1889. The company also ventured into steam- powered snow plows, and other items, but sales gradually declined during the last decade of the 19th century. The company lasted until 1899. Over 900 steam locomotives had been produced by the Taunton Locomotive Manufacturing Company in its roughly sixty years in existence.1947 Taunton Daily Gazette article ==Legacy== In 1906 the site of the locomotive works was purchased by New England Cotton Yarns, a large conglomerate of textile mills, based in Boston. In 1947 the buildings of the Taunton Locomotive Manufacturing Company were demolished.Taunton Daily Gazette article The site is now occupied by a shopping center, constructed in the 1970s as part of an urban redevelopment plan by the City of Taunton. ==References== Category:Locomotive manufacturers of the United States Category:Defunct companies based in Massachusetts Category:Defunct manufacturing companies of the United States Category:Manufacturing companies based in Massachusetts Category:Taunton, Massachusetts Category:Industrial archaeological sites in the United States Category:Industrial buildings and structures in Massachusetts Category:Vehicle manufacturing companies established in 1849 Category:Manufacturing companies disestablished in 1899 Category:1849 establishments in Massachusetts Category:1899 disestablishments in Massachusetts ","title":"Taunton Locomotive Manufacturing Company"},{"id":"20203853","text":"The Psychology of Nuclear Proliferation: Identity, Emotions, and Foreign Policy is a 2006 book by Jacques E.

A spinneret is a device used to extrude a polymer solution or polymer melt to form fibers. Streams of viscous polymer exit via the spinneret into air or liquid leading to a phase inversion which allows the polymer to solidify. The individual polymer chains tend to align in the fiber because of viscous flow. This airstream liquid-to-fiber formation process is similar to the production process for cotton candy. The fiber production process is generally referred to as \\"spinning\\". Depending on the type of spinneret used, either solid or hollow fibers can be formed. Spinnerets are also used for electrospinning and electrospraying applications. They are sometimes called coaxial needles, or coaxial emitters. Spinnerets are usually made of metals with melting points too low to withstand the heating processes employed in industrial metallurgy, and thus are generally not used in constructing metals.

The Broncos selected Smith in the 2nd round (37th overall) in the 2009 NFL Draft. The Broncos traded their first round pick in 2010 in order to select him. This trade, among other poor decisions, led to the firing of coach Josh McDaniels. The pick Denver traded to Seattle was used to select Pro Bowler Earl Thomas. On July 26, 2009, Smith signed a four-year, $4.08 million contract with a $2.15 million signing bonus. The contract allowed Smith to earn $750,000 through a one-time playing-time incentive that was guaranteed for injury. In addition, if Smith won Defensive Rookie of the Year in 2009, he would have received $100,000. The contract also included a $50,000 workout bonus in 2011 and a $130,000 workout bonus in 2012. His base salary was $310,000 in 2009, $395,000 in 2010, $480,000 in 2011, and $565,000 in 2012. ===Detroit Lions=== On September 4, 2010, Smith was traded to the Detroit Lions for TE Dan Gronkowski. He had his first career interception on September 26 against the Minnesota Vikings. The following week, he beat Green Bay Packers receiver Greg Jennings on a jump ball for his second career interception. In a home game against the St. Louis Rams on October 10, Smith returned an interception 42 yards for a touchdown in the Lions 44-6 win. Against the Washington Redskins on October 30, Smith had a big interception late in the game to help the Lions comeback to beat Washington. He led the Lions in interceptions for the 2010 season. On August 31, 2012, the Lions released Smith as one of their final roster cuts. He was re-signed on October 18 due to injuries to Jacob Lacey and Bill Bentley. In Week 7 against the Chicago Bears, Smith was fined $15,750 for horse-collar tackling Brandon Marshall. ===NFL statistics=== {  - ! Year !! Team !! GP !! COMB !! TOTAL !! AST !! SACK !! FF !! FR !!

The church is located at 1439 West Main Road, Middletown, Rhode Island. It is an early example of Richard Upjohn's work in translating Gothic architecture from stone to affordable designs for small, wooden churches. Built in 1845, Holy Cross Church exemplifies the architecture made accessible by the publication in 1852 of Upjohn's book, Rural Architecture. In its survey of Middletown's architectural resources, the Rhode Island Historical Preservation Commission recommended the Church of the Holy Cross for inclusion in the National Register, along with Upjohn's more luxurious Italianate Hamilton Hoppin House. ==Description== A 1-story, end-gable, Gothic Revival structure with patterned- shingle sides, a projecting pedimented entry, square belfry in front and stained-glass Gothic windows. ==History== Holy Cross Church was designed by Mr. Richard Upjohn, an Englishman, who also designed Trinity Church in New York and St. Stephen's and Grace Church in Providence, Rhode Island. Upjohn was commissioned to build three Episcopal churches on Aquidneck Island, the other two being St. Mary's in Portsmouth and the now demolished Old Emmanual Church in Newport. At its consecration on October 14, 1845, Bishop Henshaw said, \\"Rustic in its exterior, but so chaste in its interior finish, and so perfect in its proportion, that it is more imposing in its religious impression and far better adapted to its sacred use than many buildings of far greater cost and pretensions.\\" From the church history: :\\"The Church of the Holy Cross had its beginnings specifically with two people, Miss Sarah Gibbs and John Henry Gilliat and possibly indirectly with a third person, Miss Cynthia Taggart, also with the unnamed people who welcomed the opportunity to attend religious services near their homes. In the early 1840s, Miss Gibbs became interested in bringing religious services and instruction to her neighbors. In November 1843, at the invitation of Rev. Francis Vinton, rector of Trinity Church, the Rev. Hobart Williams arrived in South Portsmouth to organize a mission. Miss Gibbs invited Rev. Williams to make his home at Oakland. Services were held at Oakland, a nearby school house, at homes of neighbors and in a school house on Middle Road in Portsmouth. In the spring of 1844 the attendance at the morning services became too large for the small school house and was transferred to Oliphant School on West Main Road in Middletown. On the first Sunday after Easter, April 14, 1844, Morning prayer was publicly offered in that place for the first time. Services were continued until the fall of the same year. The growing religious interest in the neighborhood now seemed to justify the building of a free chapel to provide a place where services could be held in the middle of the island. In April 1845, Mr. John H. Gilliat purchased from Thomas George Rogers, a brother-in-law of Cynthia Taggart, 1/2 acre of land on the South corner of Oliphant Lane and West Road for $75. Mr. Richard Upjohn, an Englishman, was employed as the architect. Mr. Upjohn had designed Trinity Church in New York and St. Stephen's Church and Grace Church in Providence. The Church was built with the gift from Mr. Gilliat of $2,145. Others gave $283.50 for the site and some special interior furnishings.\\" ==See also== Carpenter Gothic ==References *Church page on diocese website *Town of Middletown History Category:Episcopal churches in Rhode Island Category:Richard Upjohn church buildings Category:Religious organizations established in 1843 Category:19th- century Episcopal church buildings Category:Carpenter Gothic church buildings in the United States Category:Gothic Revival church buildings in Rhode Island Category:1843 establishments in Rhode Island ","title":"Church of the Holy Cross (Middletown, Rhode Island)"},{"id":"20204263","text":"Hof Prison () is a prison in Hof in Vestfold og Telemark, Norway.

He played college football at Oklahoma, and played for the Minnesota Vikings of the National Football League (NFL) from 2009 until his retirement in 2015. ==High school career== Loadholt attended Fountain Middle School and Fountain-Fort Carson High School in Fountain, Colorado, where he was a two-way lineman, team captain and a two-time All-State selection. His senior year of football ended in the second round to Palisade High School; in that match-up, he played against another two-time All-State selection, Matt Popick. In his senior year he also had 113 tackles along with eight touchdowns and was named Colorado Springs Area Player of the Year. He obtained a 1.23 GPA throughout his high school career as well. Also a standout in basketball and track, Loadholt led Fountain-Fort Carson's basketball team to the state title game when he averaged 17 points, 11 rebounds and three blocks per game. In track & field, Loadholt won a state championship title in the discus with a throw of 48.23 meters (158-2), and was a state runner-up in the shot put with a personal-best of 16.44 meters (53-10).http://footballtalentadvisors.com/blog/2009/06/ He originally committed to play college football at the Colorado, but did not qualify academically, and therefore he headed to junior college. ==College careerGarden City=== At Garden City Community College, Loadholt was a two-time junior college All-American. In his sophomore year, he had 93 pancake blocks and 113 tackles in 2006 and was named 2006 Jayhawk Conference Lineman of the Year.

He had the highest run grade on the team at 75%. He received All-Big 12 first team honors by the Dallas Morning News and an All-American honorable mention by Sports Illustrated In his senior year, Loadholt played left tackle in an offensive line that allowed 11 sacks all season, the third-lowest total of any team in the country, in 476 passing attempts. Protecting quarterback Sam Bradford, who threw 48 touchdown passes and went on to win the 2008 Heisman Trophy, and leading the way for DeMarco Murray and Chris Brown, who both ran for more than 1,000 yards, Loadholt helped the 2008 Sooners to become the highest-scoring team in college football‚Äôs modern era. ==Professional career2009 NFL Draft=== Loadholt was regarded as one of the better offensive tackles in the 2009 NFL Draft. Although his size and athletic ability were never in doubt, scouts questioned his poor aggressiveness and technique. ===Minnesota Vikings=== Loadholt was selected in the second round, 54th overall, by the Minnesota Vikings. He was signed by the Vikings on July 29, 2009.http://www.tulsaworld.com/sportsextra/article.aspx?subjectid=223&articleid;=20090730_223_B2_EDENPR293220 2009 season As a rookie, Loadholt stepped into a starting role at right tackle, opening 15 regular season games and both playoff contests, including the NFC Championship game. The 15 starts were the most by a Vikings rookie offensive tackle since Korey Stringer back in 1995 and he became just the fifth Vikings rookie offensive tackle to start a season opener, joining Doug Davis in 1966 as the only other right tackle. He was inactive for the game at St. Louis on October 11 due to a leg injury. For his first-year performance, he was named to the NFL All-Rookie team by Sporting News and PFWA as he helped the Vikings offense rank No. 5 in the NFL in total offense, the highest ranking since the 2004 season, and paved the way for running back Adrian Peterson to rush for 1,383 yards and 18 touchdowns, a new team record for rushing scores and the third-best single-season rushing total in team history.http://www.sportingnews.com/nfl-news/138968-sporting-news-2009-nfl- all-rookie-team Sporting News 2009 NFL All-Rookie Team 2010 season In his second year, Loadholt started all 16 games, joining only fellow offensive tackle Bryant McKinnie along the offensive line to start all 16 games. He helped pave the way for Adrian Peterson to rush for 1,298 yards and break the 100-yard mark 5 times during the season. In week 3, he helped Adrian Peterson rumble for an 80-yard touchdown against the Detroit Lions. In a game against the Dallas Cowboys in week 6, he joined former Oklahoma teammate Jon Cooper as a starter on the line when Cooper opened the game at center. In a comeback win against the Arizona Cardinals in week 9, he protected Brett Favre as he threw for a career-best 446 yards that helped the Vikings prevail 27-24 in OT over the Cardinal. 2011 season Loadholt (left) in 2011 In 2011, Loadholt joined fellow offensive line teammate Charlie Johnson as the only Vikings linemen to start all 16 games during the season, helping Adrian Peterson break the 100-yard mark in 3 games during the season with fullback Toby Gerhart and quarterback Joe Webb each breaking the 100-yard plateau once during the year.

Garden City Community College was established in 1919 to provide a means for post-secondary education for area residents. The school initially shared facilities in Sabine Hall and Calkins Hall in the 100 block of Buffalo Jones Avenue with Garden City High School and opened with a first class of less than three dozen students. The college moved to the then-new Garden City High School building in 1954. The Kansas Legislature passed the Community College Act in 1965, authorizing establishment of 22 independent colleges including GCCC. Today GCCC is one of 19 Kansas community colleges. Garden City Community College is a member of the Kansas Jayhawk Community College Conference and offers a variety of sports programs, referred to as the Broncbusters and Lady Broncbusters. GCCC has experienced large success in football, basketball, and baseball. ==History== Williams Broncbuster Baseball Stadium at Garden City Community College Pauline Joyce Fine Arts Building Thomas F. Saffell Library ===Early years=== The first four community colleges in Kansas were established in 1919, and GCCC is one of two from that group which still exist. It was created by county-wide election on April 1, 1919, and opened in September of the same year. GCCC initially shared facilities in Sabine Hall and Calkins Hall in the 100 block of Buffalo Jones Avenue with Garden City High School, and opened with a first class of less than three dozen students. The first graduate, Mildred Hope of Garden City, earned her degree in the spring of 1920. ===1950s‚Äì1990s=== The college moved to the then- new Garden City High School building in 1954, and first occupied a campus of its own in 1958 on property where Buffalo Jones Elementary School is located. The first effort to establish GCCC as an entity separate from the Garden City public school system was launched in 1958. It was killed in a Kansas legislative committee, a second attempt was also rejected in 1962. In 1963, the college moved back to Sabine and Calkins Halls, and also made use of nearby Ben Grimsley Gym, as well as a group of adjacent World War II-era barracks buildings. The Kansas Legislature passed the Community College Act in 1965, authorizing establishment of 22 independent colleges including GCCC. This authorized the institution to levy taxes, conduct its own programs, and function independently of the K-12 school system. County voters elected the first GCCC Board of Trustees in July 1965. Today, GCCC is one of 19 Kansas community colleges. The present 14-building, campus at 801 Campus Drive was designed between July 1965 and January 1966. Voters approved a $2.5 million bond issue, supplemented by a $538,000 federal grant for construction. Erected between 1968 and 1970 were the original residence hall, Academic Building, Saffell Library, Administration Building, Fouse Science-Math Building, Pauline Joyce Fine Arts Building and Physical Education Building. The Collins Technical Building was added in 1974, and a residential life addition was built in 1978. The Penka Building was added in 1986, when additions were completed to the Joyce, Collins and PE Buildings. Williams Stadium, a baseball facility, was also added. In January 1996 a . 1.4 million dollar technical teaching laboratory was completed so that GCCC could provide more training for workers in area and national industries. ===2000s‚Äìpresent=== A three-building student apartment complex opened in 2002, and a , two-level addition to the original student center was completed in 2003, with the entire structure renamed the Beth Tedrow Student Center. The , three-level, two-story Student and Community Services Center opened in August 2006 and was dedicated in October of the same year. Attached to the original Administration Building, the $3.12 million facility consolidated public and student services, provided an on-campus home for adult basic education, added a series of 21st-century classrooms and created a single point of assistance for most services GCCC provides. In the summer of 2018, the college board of trustees fired the college's president, Herbert Swender, after the college's faculty senate presented the board with a report describing \\"bullying, intimidation, sexual harassment and retaliation allegations against Swender and concerns about the college‚Äôs upcoming accreditation review.\\" His termination agreement with the college includes continued employment through the end of 2018 as a consultant. ==Accreditation== Garden City Community College is regionally accredited by the Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools. The GCCC Nursing Program is accredited by the Kansas State Board of Nursing and the National League for Nursing Accrediting Commission (NLNAC). Certain GCCC programs have also obtained other specific individual accreditation. GCCC has been accepted for the continuous quality improvement accreditation model by the national Academic Quality Improvement Project. While the normal accreditation review process is every ten years, member schools who participate in the AQIP program have their accreditation reviewed yearly. ==Athletics== The athletic teams offered at GCCC are referred to as the Broncbusters and compete in the Kansas Jayhawk Community College Conference. GCCC owns more than east of Campus Drive, which has been developed in a cooperative effort with the City of Garden City. Named Tangeman Fields in honor of Dr. James Tangeman, a former president, the property includes softball and baseball facilities. Also located there are the college's indoor baseball practice building, a football practice area, running track with public seating, and soccer fields. ==Gallery== File:Garden City Community Center Student Center (front view) IMG_5869.JPGGarden City Community College Student and Community Services Center, front view File:Garden City Community College Student Center IMG_5862.JPGGCCC Student and Community Services Center, rear view File:John Collins Vocational Building, GCCC IMG_5868.JPGJohn Collins Vocational Building File:Dennis B.

As its title indicates, the book is an entry in the long-running series of books about the Land of Oz, written by L. Frank Baum and his successors.Paul Nathanson, Over the Rainbow: The Wizard of Oz as a Secular Myth of America, Albany, NY, State University of New York Press, 1991.Suzanne Rahn, The Wizard of Oz: Shaping and Imaginary World, New York, Twayne, 1998.Michael O'Neal Riley, Oz and Beyond: The Fantasy World of L. Frank Baum, Lawrence, KS, University Press of Kansas, 1997. The publication of The Unknown Witches of Oz was timed to coincide with the centennial of the original Oz book, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (as was also true of Gina Wickwar's The Hidden Prince of Oz and Edward Einhorns's Paradox in Oz). Hardenbrook's novel is the first volume of a planned trilogy. ==The witches== Locasta is the name that Baum provided his Good Witch of the North in his 1902 dramatization of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. The Three Adepts are characters that Baum introduced in his final Oz book, Glinda of Oz -- though Hardenbrook changes their names and particulars, making them Locasta's granddaughters. ==The plot== Locasta, the Good Witch of the North, is forced out of Oz by the evil witch Mombi. Locasta solicits help to return to Oz, from a boy named Dan, a sixteen-year-old orphan she meets at the Los Angeles Public Library. Back in Oz, she learns that the land is in danger of conquest by a constellation of evil forces, including the Nome King, a genie named Taarna, and the demons and witches of Whaqoland. Locasta joins with Glinda and Princess Ozma, and the Adepts, to foil the villains and restore the moral order. In a notable departure from the practice of earlier writers on Oz, Hardenbrook creates a teenaged protagonist as a romantic interest for Ozma. ==Conceptual frame== Hardenbrook goes farther than many previous Oz authors in an attempt to provide a contemporary conceptual framework for the fictional world of Oz. In a Prologue titled \\"The Story So Far,\\" Hardenbrook specifies that Oz exists in a parallel universe, in \\"a galaxy very like our own Milky Way\\" with \\"a star virtually identical to our sun....\\" The star has \\"a planet that corresponds to Earth\\" -- though it differs in possessing \\"two extra moons and a polychromatic ring system....\\" The planet contains continents and archipelagoes that include \\"Dodgesonia\\" and \\"Geiselgea\\" as well as \\"Baumgea.\\" Hardenbrook goes on to summarize the narrative background of the Oz mythos -- the fairy queen Lurline and the whole scope and structure of magic, wizards and sorceresses crucial to Baum's fantasy -- before he gets to his story in earnest.Dave Hardenbrook, The Unknown Witches of Oz, Lakeville, MN, Galde Press, 2000; Prologue, \\"The Story So Far,\\" pp. xi-xiv. ==Tone== Hardenbrook writes in a more modern and ironic vein than the traditional Oz authors did; he describes Ozma as \\"the only world leader with an unwavering one-hundred-percent job approval rating!\\"The Unknown Witches of Oz, p. 2. His malevolent genie comes out of a spray can. Allusions to Bill Clinton, Rush Limbaugh, and environmentalism also occur.

A miner named Mike Reynolds who mined the river in the 1860s recovered a 36-ounce gold nugget. This was the largest nugget recovered from the river. The river was mined with many methods including hydraulics, tunnels, and shafts. During the Gold Rush this river went through two eras of great activity. The first era was from 1863 to 1868 and the second was from 1885 to 1900.

Protectionists Senator James Drake (Queensland), James McCay (Corinella), Allan McLean (Gippsland) and Sir George Turner (Balaclava) accepted office under Reid and effectively ended their connection with the Protectionist Party, becoming Free Trade MPs. They were joined by Richard Edwards (Oxley), Senator Simon Fraser (Victoria), Sir Philip Fysh (Denison) and James McColl (Echuca). Around this time the Revenue Tariff Party was dissolved, and its two parliamentarians, Senator Henry Dobson (Tasmania) and William McWilliams (Franklin), also became Free Traders. Protectionists Sir John Forrest (Swan) and Sir John Quick (Bendigo) also dissolved their relationship with Deakin's party, but stopped short of joining the Free Traders. They were the beginning of what became known as the \\"Corner\\" group of independent conservative protectionists. *In 1906, the Free Trade Party was renamed the Anti-Socialist Party. *In 1906, the Western Australian Party was formed. Sir John Forrest (Swan), formerly a Protectionist, ran as its endorsed candidate, but in reality remained a member of the \\"Corner\\" group. * Anti-Socialist MP Norman Cameron (Wilmot) lost pre-selection and contested the election as an Independent. * Labour Senator Anderson Dawson (Queensland) initially announced his intention to retire at this election. He ultimately decided to contest it, but as the Labour candidates had already been selected he ran as an Independent. * Labour MP James Ronald (Southern Melbourne), whose seat was abolished, was unsuccessful seeking pre-selection for Melbourne Ports.

As of the November 2011, it was the largest club in Queensland and second largest in Australia behind the Waverley Baseball Club in Victoria. As of the 2011‚Äì12 season, the club fields a team in every age group of the Greater Brisbane League from Under 8 to Under 20, as well as seven senior teams including an Over 35 Master's team. On 9 December 2008 it was named by the Australian Baseball Federation as the Club of the Year.2009 BADA Award Winners ==History== Redcliffe Baseball club was founded as a senior club in 1948 by an American ex-serviceman named Chuck Carroll and was later named the Redcliffe Whitesox.Eagles Down To Whitesox. (27 November 1971). Redcliffe & Bayside Herald, p52 .Harris, J.O (2009). Queensland Baseball 1905‚Äì1990. p38-41 & 63 Younger kids played at Redcliffe Police Citizens Youth Club then went elsewhere if they wanted to go on. Redcliffe Baseball Club had no direct feeder clubs from junior PCYC. In 1991 the PCYC could not support baseball anymore and the seniors wanted feeder clubs to support them so they joined forces at the Silcock Street oval and named themselves the Peninsula Padres ‚Äì based on the San Diego Padres. In the first year there were 7 teams in total. They needed a home run fence which they did not have at Silcock Street and could not put up. Council therefore asked them to relocate to the Redcliffe Showgrounds in 1996. The club had to take the fences down at showtime and then adjust the grounds after the show to make it suitable for baseball again. However, a big plus was the great light facility on the grounds. With greater promotion and a new facility, the move paid off with a boom and a resurgence of interest in baseball. Within a year at the Showgrounds there were 16 teams. In 2003‚Äì2004 the Council offered Talobilla Park as an option. Touch football had rejected Council‚Äôs suggestion so baseball and softball worked together to establish these sports in a permanent setting. The council, Queensland Government and the club used money to put in irrigation, back nets, turf and ancillary fixtures etc. to make the move possible. Also shipped in, was the old Redcliffe golf-club pro shop which is used for a canteen and meeting house. The move caused yet another resurgence and the club has now grown to 22 teams with about 225 players not to mention countless volunteers, coaches and administrators involved with the club. Padres is now the biggest club in Queensland, as well as second largest in Australia.Redcliffe Padres History ===2000‚Äì2001: Modern Major A=== In 2000, Baseball Queensland decided to make the Major A competition a wooden bat league and the Redcliffe Major A team led by Scott Brockie struggled to adjust to the change and finished mid-table. However, both Major B and C grade were finalists. The club fielded eleven junior teams and three senior teams and won its first ever Brisbane North premiership in the U12 age group.King, T., Wilson, K. (2001, April). President, and Secretary Reports. Redcliffe Leagues Padres Baseball Club Yearbook 2000‚Äì2001, pp. 4‚Äì9. ===2001‚Äì2002: Triumphant Padres=== Geoff Sharpe holds the B-Grade trophy at Holloway FieldThe 2001‚Äì2002 season was the most successful year since the club had been formed ten years ago, with President Terry King and A-Grade coaches Phil Schramm and Glen Brockie, two premierships were won in both Major B (second division) and Minor A (fourth division). The club fielded four senior and sixteen junior teams, making it the largest club in Queensland that year. Before the start of the season, the club's storage shed, a chicken shed used for the local Redcliffe Show, was set on fire by an arsonist with the club losing all but a single junior kitbag. That season the club also improved facilities at Redcliffe Showgrounds were the club was based by adding netting to the batting cages and having a PA system installed. The club was awarded four Greater Brisbane League semi-finals and the Northside junior grand finals.King, T., Hobbs, D. & West, S. (2002, April). President, Secretary and Treasurer Reports. Redcliffe Leagues Padres Baseball Club Yearbook 2001‚Äì2002, pp. 2‚Äì6. ===2002‚Äì2003: A Growing Club=== By the start of the season, the club had increased their numbers to six senior teams and twenty junior teams on the back of a heavy push in recruiting and opening of a Redcliffe schools competition. With a change of hands of club presidents to Keith Land, the club reigned as the largest club in Queensland and was named as the \\"Redcliffe Leagues Club Leading Edge Club of the Year\\". The year also came with news of moving to a new grounds at Talobilla Park by the 2004‚Äì2005 season. The club was awarded six Greater Brisbane League semi finals and three grand finals as well as the North preliminary finals. In addition the Queensland Academy of Sport utilised the fields for training as well as the Queensland Under 23 and regional teams. The season marked all Major league teams making the finals as well as the club's first official Canadian import, Cav Whitely. The club also set a Greater Brisbane League record in Major C, defeating Toowoomba Rangers 42‚Äì0.Land, K., Wilson, K. & West, S. (2003, April). President, Secretary and Treasurer Reports. Redcliffe Leagues Padres Baseball Club Yearbook 2002‚Äì2003, pp. 5‚Äì10. ===2003‚Äì2004: Last at Showgrounds=== Much of the focus of the season was off the field as the club prepared for a move to their new grounds at Talobilla Park by securing government and council grants. The club had a small decrease in size as it went down to six senior teams and seventeen junior teams, yet only managed to secure an U12 premiership. The Major C team also came close to breaking its own Greater Brisbane League record when they defeated Narangba Demons 41‚Äì1 to become minor premiers.Land, K. & West, S. (2004, April). President, Secretary Reports. Redcliffe Leagues Padres Baseball Club Yearbook 2003‚Äì2004, pp. 2‚Äì5. ===2007‚Äì2008: A-Grade Success=== The 2007‚Äì2008 proved to be the most successful one in history for the Redcliffe Padres Major A team as they won the Commissioners Cup and finished 3rd overall in the regular season standings of the Greater Brisbane League with teams stats of a win percentage of .656, batting average of .256, ERA of 4.46 and fielding average of .936. Success in the 2007‚Äì2008 season was mostly on the back of Canadian import Brett Murray who finished the season with an ERA of 2.42 and 122 strikeouts over the course of 104.1 innings and an 11‚Äì3 pitching record, highest in the league. Brett also contributed with the bat collecting 38 hits, including 11 doubles in the season. Steven Greer was a surprise representative for the Queensland Rams team that year along with Jay Nilsson and coach Bob Nilsson, Steven led the team with runs scored (30) and bases stolen (18 from 19 attempts), this capped off a fine Claxton Shield performance from previously unknown Steven Greer with 3/6 in two games including 3 RBIs.Claxton Shield Results Phil Schramm also had a high season with an OB% of .480 in 19 games including 4 saves. Schramm also led the league in hit by pitch balls, an astounding 16 times.Greater Brisbane League 2007/2008 stats The team had some success after qualifying for the post season, winning their semi-final series 2‚Äì0. However, the grand final series against Runcorn Indians proved to be difficult as import and starting pitcher Brett Murray's visa expired before the series could commence. A defensively weak Padres team lost the series convincingly 2‚Äì0 to be the Greater Brisbane League runners up. ===2008‚Äì2009: Australian Club of the Year=== The A-Grade team looked promising with two new Canadian imports, Devon Franklin and Brandon Hunter as well as a couple of new senior players, including the return of ex Queensland Rams pitcher Brian Debert. On top of the collection of new senior players, the A-Grade team would also see the emergence of eligible U18 players such as Queensland U18 pitcher, Lucas Bakker. The team got off to a shaky start making 18 errors and only one win in their first four games, but managed to notch wins against all three Brisbane Metro teams in as many weeks following. However, the club's A-Grade success was dampened by announcement of Canadian Devon Franklin that he would be leaving Australia early to go home before Christmas. Padres with the Commissioner's Shield At the Christmas break, Padres was awarded the opportunity to play in the second consecutive A-Grade Commissioners Cup, with coach Bob Nilsson and center fielder Stephen Greer away after being called up to the Queensland Rams squad.Steven Greer off to Perth The team played Surfers Paradise on 21 December at Beenleigh Hawks baseball ground and retained the shield under coach and Nilsson brother, Ron Nilsson. The game was won 4‚Äì3 with Brian Debert pitching 8 innings.Padres to Defend Commissioners ShieldPadres Retain Commissioners Shield The A-Grade team looked like they were going to cement a 2nd-place finish on the Northside until a horror run in March. Apart from the a two-game sweep against All- Stars, where A-Grade veteran Danny Dunsdon became the first player to play 400 games for the club, the team lost their four remaining games against Windsor and Pine Rivers meaning the team only scraped into the finals with the 2nd wildcard. They would face off against Pine Hills Lightning in the semi finals but lost to an opposition with far more momentum going into the finals in the 3rd game of a best-of-three series. The B-Grade team also had a horror run in the second half of the season, dropping them from equal 3rd at the end of the year to 8th by the end of the season. This horror run was not assisted by a mid-season injury to pitcher William Preinke who broke his arm while pitching. Major C, Minor A and Minor C enjoyed finals baseball as well, but neither grades managed to qualify for the final. Indeed, the only premiership for the club would be the U16 Division 1 team, who also won the minor premiership that year. On 9 December 2008, the club was named by the Australian Baseball Federation as the 2009 Baseball Club of the Year along with the Doncaster Baseball Club in Victoria, the largest club in Australia. In May, the club was also awarded Baseball Queensland junior club of the year as well as Sally West being awarded Volunteer of the Year.West, D., Brockie, G., West, S. (2009, June). Annual Report 2008/2009 pp. 3‚Äì4. ===2009‚Äì10 season: Major A Minor Premiers=== The Greater Brisbane League 2009-10 season commenced late September in 2009 and is an important one for the club as a new Greater Brisbane League format will be introduced with the Major A and Major B split into two divisions as well as a Masters competition being run by Baseball Queensland. The season saw the introduction of teams from Carina and Toowoomba back into the Majors. On 2 July, the club announced its new A-Grade coach as Todd Fairbrother, an ex Daikyo Dolphins and Queensland Rams player and coach to replace retired Bob Nilsson. Bob, however, soon returned to coach the B-Grade team and helped manage the A's.A Grade Coach Announced For Season 2009‚Äì10 The club finished 5th overall after the qualifying rounds with a 9‚Äì5 record, placing them in the top eight and qualifying for the Queensland Major League. Although the team started strong in the qualifying round, the team dropped four straight games including one run losses to Wests and Beenleigh Hawks, but finished strong with the return of Rodney Wodson from overseas, winning six from their last seven. After the preliminary rounds, the B-Grade team, by finishing 2nd, qualified for the Commissioners Shield and defeated Windsor 7‚Äì6 for the club's third successive Commissioners Shield trophy. With expanded rosters for the 2010 Claxton Shield, four players were named in the active 19-man roster; Carlos Prichard, Steven Greer, Rodney Wodson and Jay Nilsson. Inaugural SQBL A Premiers The club's regular season was the best ever for a Redcliffe A-Grade team, finishing with a 14‚Äì4 record securing the minor premiership and top seed for the finals. The team included Jay Nilsson leading the league in batting average (.443) and Rodney Wodson leading the league in ERA (1.77). It was also the first season of Daniel Nilsson who represented Australia in the 2009 World Youth Baseball Championship before the season and managed to hit a home run in his debut at bat. The finals run was less than ideal for A-Grade who went down to Windsor in three games (6‚Äì5, 5‚Äì6, 5‚Äì6) in the semi-final and Wests (9‚Äì0, 9‚Äì18, 2‚Äì8) in the preliminary final. Wests went on to beat Windsor for the premiership. The only successful team in the season being the SQBL A team who defeated Pine Hills 11‚Äì4. ===2010‚Äì11 season=== With the departure of Bob Nilsson, Phil Overlack joined Todd Fairbrother at the helm of the A-Grade squad. The team qualified for Major League, but missed out on finals by 1 win. The 7‚Äì9 Pine Hills Lightning would go on to defeat the 16‚Äì2 Windsor Royals in A-Grade that year. All other grades qualified for the finals, with Major B bowing out in the preliminary final, SQBL A losing their grand final by 1 run in the final inning, SQBL B winning the premiership and SQBL C scraping into the semi finals, but getting thoroughly defeated. ==Uniform== As of the 2009‚Äì2010 season, there are two uniforms used, one for U8's to Little League (U12) and one for U14's up. The junior uniform is a singular grey T-shirt with red 3/4 sleeves and drawstring, belt-less grey pants. The senior uniform is a red undershirt with red piping around the neck and down either side of the front buttons and \\"Padres\\" in red letters outlined in white arched across the chest. Players also get to choose a personal number between 1‚Äì99 that is displayed on the back of their overshirt in large red block numbers with white outline. Pants are like juniors except they are button-up grey pants with red piping and a red belt. Both the juniors and seniors wear red socks and the Padres cap is red with a stylized 'P' for Padres, very similar to the Philadelphia Phillies cap insignia. While the Redcliffe Baseball Club was known as the 'Whitesox' from 1951 till 1973. The uniform was a black undershirt and overshirt with white trim sleeves. On the right middle side of the shirt was the word \\"SOX\\" in an Old English font, diagonally arranged. The cap was white with black brim and the SOX logo printed diagonally across it. Pants were plain white with a black belt and socks. The first Peninsula Padres uniform was worn between 1992 and 1995 uniforms were a red 3/4 length sleeved undershirt and a white bodied, red pin striped T-shirt styled overshirt with \\"Padres\\" arched across the chest. Pants were white, also with red pinstripe, instead of the current grey and socks were white with red trimmed sides. The cap was primary red with the insignia a red oblate 'P' cutting into an upside white oblate 'P' to form a square. The juniors wore a plain white uniform with a red collar trim and \\"Padres\\" in red arched across the chest. Pants were plain white with a red pipe down the outer leg sides. Plain white socks were also worn. Insignia was on the right sleeve of both uniforms. In the 1995‚Äì1996 season the red undershirt was reduced to a T-shirt size and only visible above the overshirts collar. The hat insignia was changed to the stylized 'P' and sock colour was reversed so that socks were now primarily red with white foot and side trim. Juniors were changed to a red instead of white base to the uniform and the word \\"Padres\\" was changed to white. The modern uniform was first issued at the start of the 1999 season. The overshirt was changed to the grey base with red piping and sleeves shortened so the undershirt was visible and pants were changed to grey with red piping. Also the socks changed to a plain red. The cap changed slight as the 'P' was thinned, giving a more stylistic look. In the 2002‚Äì2003 season, the Major A team wore a black undershirt and socks, as well as a black with red brimmed cap instead of the traditional red for night games played on a Friday night. The night uniform was scrapped by 2004 and the singular uniform for all senior teams returned. ==Current season== The current season has seen a major reshuffling in the A-Grade playing roster with longtime Padres players Jay Nilsson, Ryan Nilsson and Steve Greer all opting to join Bob Nilsson at Pine Hills Lightning. The club also lost pitcher Rodney Wodson to Pine Hills, Brian Debert to All-Stars, Shannon Mills to Windsor Royals as well as Lucas Bakker and Jake Pannunzio to college. To fill the player drain, the club added imports Jeff Tezak and Kevin Hoef from the United States. Also returning from college was Nathan Corscadden and Greg Johnston as well as the debuts of Australian junior representatives Sam Holland and Mike Young. The club qualified in 5th position after the first half of the season for Major League. ==School Competition== In 2002, members from the Redcliffe committee succeeded in creating a primary schools baseball competition on the Redcliffe Peninsula in Queensland to be created alongside other summer sports such as cricket and softball. This included teams from Humpybong, Scarborough, Kippa Ring, Hercules Road, Southern Cross and Grace Lutheran primary schools who play during their Friday afternoon sport at Talobilla Park. In 2009, this competition had a total of 16 teams and is the backbone to recruiting juniors in Redcliffe, making baseball more popular than cricket in Redcliffe.West, D., Brockie, G., West, S.

At the time, she owned a consulting firm and served on the tree advisory committee. She was also a member of the Greater Seminole Area Chamber of Commerce Board of Directors, and served on the governor's tax reform task force. (subscription required) The Greater Seminole Area Chamber of Commerce held a forum for the City Council candidates in February 2002. Each candidate had a brief time to make an opening statement, answer two questions, and make a closing statement.

She advocated care in annexation. (subscription required) She received the support of the Seminole Professional Fire Fighters Association. (subscription required) She was elected to the Seminole City Council in March 2002, her first publicly elected office. Of the three people elected to the council in that race, she had the most votes. (subscription required) In 2003, she supported levying fines for false fire alarms. The fines would increase after with the fourth false alarm in a twelve-month period. The legislation addressed concerns that false alarm response was reducing the availability of fire fighters. About ten percent of the fire department's calls had been to false alarms, with most of those due to faulty alarm systems. (subscription required) She also favored the changing the name of the city's signature festival, the \\"Seminole Pow Wow.\\" The name was considered offensive, and politically incorrect, as well as inappropriate as being totally unrelated to Native American culture.

(subscription required) During the campaign, Long suggested solutions for the Florida insurance crisis, while acknowledging the complexity of the issues. She recommended making Citizen's Property Insurance Co, the state-run \\"insurer of last resort,\\" more like a business, assessing risk and operating within a balanced budget. She recommended forming a consortium of coastal states to share costs in dealing with windstorms and catastrophic loss. She also recommended looking into \\"insurance savings accounts\\" to deal with catastrophic loses. These accounts would be funded with money from premiums paid by citizens and the private insurers.

(subscription required) Long used her office to champion unincorporated residents within her district, who felt they were not receiving adequate benefits from the Pinellas Park Water Management District. The district builds and maintains drainage projects in mid-Pinellas County. Residents in the Bayou Club and Lealman areas did not feel they received direct benefits from the water management district, and that they should be able to opt out of paying taxes to it. The District responded that Bayou Club would not exist without the drainage system it provided. Representative Long sought to have the matter decided by referendum. (subscription required) Long sponsored a bill that would prohibit local governments from spending public money on \\"political advertisement or electioneering communication.\\" (subscription required) She opposed a 2008 bill, HB 257, that required pregnant women to have a sonogram before undergoing a first-trimester abortion. (subscription required) She and state Senator Dennis L. Jones supported legislative action to require airports, universities and state agencies to recycle. Opponents of the bill said it would cost too much. (subscription required) In August 2008, Long told the Pinellas Park Kiwanis Club that she supports taxing Internet sales as a possible solution to state budget problems. She said that Florida had grown markedly since the tax codes were first written, and that they needed updating. 2008 campaign Prior to the 2008 election, Long spoke of the need to create a wind insurance program and improve property insurance. She also expressed concern over the tax burden of low-income seniors, first-time home buyers, and small business owners. She advocated improvements in health care, such as electronic record keeping and affordable drugs for seniors. (subscription required) She received the endorsement of the Sierra Club and the St. Petersburg Times. The Republican Party was impressed enough with her that it invited her to change parties. (subscription required) The Times lauded what it called her \\"clear-headedness\\" for her stances on reviewing special taxing districts (such as the Pinellas Park Water Management District), looking into consolidating state law enforcement agencies, and modifying the requirements for Bright Futures scholarships. (subscription required) 2008‚Äì2012 term In 2008, Long defeated Republican Christopher Peters, a lifeguard at Fort De Soto Park, with 58 percent of the vote.

As the first permanent white settlement in the East Kootenay region of the Southern Interior, Fisherville boasted a population of 5,000 inhabitants in 1865 and numerous buildings including six general stores, four saloons, two butcher shops, a brewery, a blacksmith‚Äôs shop, a boarding house, a post office, a sawmill, and government offices. Fisherville was the first in the series of town sites which sat on the bench above the Wild Horse River. Successive settlements were referred to as ‚ÄòWild Horse‚Äô or ‚ÄòKootenay‚Äô. The gold rush of 1864 was directly responsible for the creation of Galbraith‚Äôs Ferry which later became known as Fort Steele. When the railway bypassed Fort Steele in favour of Cranbrook in 1898, Fort Steele began to decline while Cranbrook grew to become the region‚Äôs economic and commercial centre. Cranbrook ‚Äì formerly known as ‚ÄòJoseph‚Äôs Prairie‚Äô ‚Äì was also site of the Ktunaxa Chief Isadore‚Äôs favourite farm. However, land ownership was eventually granted to British Colonel James Baker. Fisherville is the site of a former Gold Rush boomtown in the East Kootenay Named for Jack Fisher, who discovered the strike in the canyon of the Wild Horse River in 1863. Initially a thousand miners pushed into the canyon of that river and built Fisherville, which was soon moved a bit south and higher up than the original townsite had been when it was discovered rich gold deposits lay beneath the site. The new townsite was officially named Kootenai or Kootenay, and also Wild Horse, but remained commonly known as Fisherville. In its second winter (1864) saw only 100 white men and c.20 Chinese in residence; by 1866 the town's population was 300 Chinese and fewer than 100 whites. > In 1879 the HBC sold interests to Galbraith's firm, who operated a store at > Fisherville.

Over of university-owned land are available for pastures, crops, groves, and ornamental plantings. The university shares with the University of California, Riverside, the distinction of having the only agriculture programs in Southern California. Farmlands flank the campus, giving a stark contrast to a stereotypical urban university. *College of Business Administration: Cal Poly Pomona is one of the 500 institutions worldwide that are accredited by Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB International) at both graduate and undergraduate levels. *College of Education and Integrative Studies. *College of Engineering: The College of Engineering has the largest engineering and computer science programs in California. The college was established in 1957 and has an active enrollment of 4,500 students in seven academic departments. The college graduates one of every fourteen engineers in the state. Each year, nearly 700 engineers obtain degrees in the various disciplines. Cal Poly Pomona has the second largest civil engineering department in the United States (after Texas A&M; University in College Station) with over 1,000 undergraduates enrolled in that major alone. In 2010, the Cal Poly Pomona's College of Engineering was ranked 5th in the nation by U.S. News & World Report based on peer assessment, student selectivity, financial resources, and other factors in the ‚ÄúUniversities-Master‚Äôs‚Äù category for public universities. The Department of Chemical and Materials Engineering was formed in 1972 and is accredited by ABET, Inc. (formerly the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology) and by the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE). *College of Environmental Design: The planning programs at Cal Poly Pomona evolved from the undergraduate landscape architecture program that originally was part of the School of Agriculture. After approval of the creation of a new School of Environmental Design, the landscape and urban planning programs moved into their current building in January 1971. The Department of Urban Planning was created and soon after a Department of Architecture. Department of Urban Planning was renamed \\"Department of Urban and Regional Planning\\" in 1983 to reflect an expanded program. The School was renamed the \\"College of Environmental Design\\" in 1988. The Department of Art was transferred to Environmental Design from the College of Arts in 1992.

He was a child prodigy, and student of Fr√©d√©ric Chopin.Szulc, Tad (1998). Chopin in Paris: the life and times of the romantic composer. Pg 301. Simon and Schuster, USA. ==Life and education== Filtsch was born in M√ºhlbach (Sebe»ô) in present-day Romania. His father, a Lutheran church pastor in M√ºhlbach, was his first piano teacher. It was his first public success at the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde in Vienna. Carl and his brother Joseph, also a child pianist, arrived in Paris on November 29, 1841 and immediately sought out Chopin to be Carl's teacher. Though Chopin almost never taught children, and rarely gave a student more than one lesson per week, he agreed to teach Carl, and gave him three lessons per week. Considered Chopin's most talented pupil, Filtsch received high praise from Franz Liszt, Friedrich Wieck, Giacomo Meyerbeer, Ignaz Moscheles, the music critic Ludwig Rellstab, and fellow child prodigy, Anton Rubinstein. Filtsch began touring Europe on concert tours at the age of 13. After triumphant concerts in Paris, London, and Vienna, his promising career was cut short by an early death in Venice from tuberculosis. ==Quality of playing== According to numerous letters from Chopin and his acquaintances, Chopin considered Filtsch the most worthy interpreter of his music. A friend of Chopin, Ferdinand Denis, reported in an article in Vienna's Der Humorist in February 1843 that on one occasion after listening to Filtsch, Chopin exclaimed, \\"My God! What a child! Nobody has ever understood me as this child has...It is not imitation, it is the same sentiment, an instinct that makes him play without thinking as if it could not have been any other way. He plays almost all my compositions without having heard me [play them], without being shown the smallest thing - not exactly like me [because he has his own cachet], but certainly not less well.\\" ==Recordings== * Filtsch, Talberg, Liszt, Chopin: Piano music - Leonhard Westermayr (CD MMS 2616) * (2010) Mikuli, Teffelsen, Filtsch, Gutmann: Piano music - Hubert Rutkowski (Naxos 8.572344) * (2011) Mikuli, Teffelsen, Filtsch: Violin & piano music - Voytek Proniewicz, Alexander Jakobidze-Gitman (Naxos 8.572460) * (2012) Tellefsen and Filtsch: Piano Concerto, Concert Piece, Overture - Hubert Rutkowski, Polish Radio Symphony Orchestra, Lukasz Borowicz (Accord 177 2) *(2016) Carl Filtsch Piano Solo Pieces - Chiyo Hagiwara (ALCD-9161) ==References * The Annual Filtsch Piano Competition * Konzertstueck by Carl Filtsch (1830-1845) * Partial list of works Category:Polish Romantic composers Category:Austrian classical composers Category:Austrian children Category:Transylvanian-Saxon people Category:1830 births Category:1845 deaths Category:Austrian classical pianists Category:Male classical pianists Category:Child classical musicians Category:Pupils of Fr√©d√©ric Chopin Category:People from Sebe»ô Category:19th-century deaths from tuberculosis Category:19th-century classical composers Category:19th-century classical pianists Category:19th-century male musicians ","title":"Carl Filtsch"},{"id":"20205031","text":"The white suckerfish or mantasucker (Remora albescens) is a species of remora in the family Echeneidae, a group of elongated marine fish with adhesive discs for attaching to larger organisms. The distribution of this species is worldwide in warm open seas: it is found in the western Indian Ocean including R√©union and Mauritius, in the eastern Pacific Ocean from San Francisco to Chile (but is rare north of Baja California), and in the western and eastern central Atlantic Ocean from Florida and the Gulf of Mexico to Brazil and St. Paul's Rocks. The white suckerfish can reach in standard length. The adhesive disk is short and wide, the length 34-40% and the width 22-26% of the standard length, with 13-14 lamellae. The pelvic fins are placed far forward and narrowly attached to the abdomen; the dorsal, anal, and pectoral fins are short with reduced rays. The dorsal fin rays number 18-23, the anal fin rays 18-24, and the pectoral fin rays 18-21. The dentition is specialized, consisting of many large, stout canine teeth set in large patches in broad jaws. The head, body, and fins are colored light brown, light tan, or light grey to whitish. Three documented specimens from the Gulf of Mexico show considerable variation in color pattern, from uniform grey or pale bluish- white to light grey, darkening on the sides and belly and bearing numerous elongated spots. One living specimen immediately darkened in color when it was removed from sea water and lightened when it was returned. White suckerfish are rarely found free-swimming; they are host-specific to manta rays, and enter their host's mouth and gill chamber more often than any other remora. They are also occasionally found attached to sharks, and in the Indo-Pacific region to black marlin. Unlike some other remora species, parasitic copepods comprise a negligible part of the diet of the white suckerfish, suggesting it may not have a mutualistic relationship with its host. The white suckerfish responds to a touch on its belly by forcefully erecting its pelvic fins, possibly an adaptation to avoid crushing by its host. Nothing is known about their reproduction. It is used in Chinese medicine. ==References * Photograph white suckerfish white suckerfish ","title":"White suckerfish"},{"id":"20205035","text":"flower buds and flowersfruitA bloodwood tree \\"bleeding\\" sap Corymbia opaca, also known as the desert bloodwood, is a species of tree that is endemic to northern Australia. It has rough bark on part or all of the trunk, lance- shaped leaves, club-shaped flower buds and urn-shaped fruit. Several parts of this plant are used by Aboriginal Australians in traditional medicine. ==Description== Corymbia opaca is a tree, rarely a mallee, that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has rough, tessellated, reddish brown bark over some or all of its trunk. Young plants and coppice regrowth have petiolate, egg-shaped to lance-shaped leaves, long and wide, with a small point on the tip. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, the same shade of green or greyish green on both sides, lance-shaped, long and wide with a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in groups of seven on an unbranched, cylindrical peduncle long, the individual buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are club-shaped, with an oval floral cup about long and wide and a saucer-shaped operculum that has a central point and is about long and wide. The flowers are creamy white and the fruit is an urn-shaped capsule long and wide. ==Taxonomy and naming== The desert bloodwood was first formally described in 1985 by Denis John Carr and Stella Grace Maisie Carr who gave it the name Eucalyptus opaca and published the description in their book Eucalyptus 1 - New or little-known species of the Corymbosae. The type specimens were collected in 1983 from the Lasseter Highway near Kata Tjuta. In 1995, Ken Hill and Lawrie Johnson changed the name to Corymbia opaca, publishing the change in the journal Telopea.Philip Moore 2005 ‚ÄúA Guide to Plants of Inland Australia‚Äù Reed New Holland The specific epithet (opaca) is derived from the Latin word opacus meaning \\"darkened, dull, not shining or opaque\\". Some authors and herbaria accept C. opaca as a distinct species and others consider it to be inseparable from C. terminalis and C. tumescens. To the extent that the species can be reliably differentiated, C. terminalis has thinner leaves, larger buds and fruit and thicker pedicels than C. opaca. ==Distribution and habitat== Corymbia opaca occurs in scattered population in desert areas of the southwest Kimberley, Pilbara and northern desert regions of Western Australia, in central and southern parts of the Northern Territory (particularly around Alice Springs) and in the Mann and Musgrave Ranges in the far northwest of South Australia. It commonly grows in sandy soils in alluvial areas and on lower hillslopes.Purdie. J., Materne. C., Bubb. A, 2008 ‚ÄúA Field Guide to Plants of the Barkly Region of the Northern Territory‚Äù Barkly Landcare and Conservation Association Incorporated ==Conservation status== This eucalypt is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife and as \\"least concern\\" in South Australia. ==Use in bush medicine== Occasionally a bloodwood tree will shed a piece of bark, hence opening a \\"wound\\" through which a blood-like kino will flow. The sap flows until it crystallises, covering up the hole in the bark. Australian Aboriginals collect this substance as bush medicine. They apply the sticky gum directly to sores or cuts and it works as an antiseptic. If the sap is in a dried form, it can be crushed into powder and boiled in water to use as an antiseptic wash. Another use of the bloodwood sap by Aboriginal people is to tan \\"kangaroo-skin waterbags\\". People collect bush coconuts (a type of bush tucker) from the tree, which are produced by an insect in gall. The roots of the bloodwood tree store water. Aboriginal peoples would dig up the roots and drain the water into a container. ==See also== *List of Corymbia species ==References== opaca Category:Myrtales of Australia Category:Australian Aboriginal bushcraft Category:Rosids of Western Australia Category:Flora of the Northern Territory Category:Flora of South Australia Category:Plants described in 1985 Category:Taxa named by Lawrence Alexander Sidney Johnson Category:Taxa named by Maisie Carr ","title":"Corymbia opaca"},{"id":"20205043","text":"Logan County Schools is the sole school district located in Logan, West Virginia, United States.

The fourth named storm and fifth tropical storm or hurricane of the season, Dorothy developed on August 17 from a tropical wave to the east of the Lesser Antilles. It tracked west-northwestward throughout its entire duration, and despite forecasts of attaining hurricane status, Dorothy reached peak winds of 70 mph (110 km/) ‚Äì slightly below hurricane status. The storm struck Martinique on August 20, and subsequently began a gradual weakening trend in the Caribbean Sea. On August 23, Dorothy dissipated south of Hispaniola. Most significantly affected by the storm was Martinique, which received 26.8 in (680 mm) of rainfall in a 24‚Äëhour period. The rainfall caused flooding and mudslides, resulting in about $34 million in damage (1970 USD); 186 homes were destroyed, and 700 people were left homeless. The flooding killed up to 50 people on the island. Elsewhere in the Lesser Antilles, the storm killed one person on Dominica from heavy rainfall, and in Guadeloupe heavy damage to the banana crop was reported. ==Meteorological history== The origins of Tropical Storm Dorothy were from a tropical wave that moved off the coast of Africa on August 13. It tracked generally westward, developing into a tropical depression on August 17 about 1375 mi (2210 km) east of Tobago in the Lesser Antilles. Two days later, it strengthened into Tropical Storm Dorothy, while located about 500 mi (800 km) east of the Lesser Antilles, with its intensity confirmed by the Hurricane Hunters. With light vertical wind shear and warm water temperatures, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) remarked on August 19 that \\"hurricane status would probably be attained this afternoon or tonight.\\" Its track was expected to continue generally west-northwestward, influenced by a ridge near the Bahamas, and within 60 hours Dorothy was forecast to be north or over Puerto Rico. However, a subsequent Hurricane Hunters flight reported a more westerly motion, which would bring its track through the central Lesser Antilles. Tropical Storm Dorothy gradually intensified, reaching peak winds of 70 mph (110 km/h) on August 20 just east- northeast of Barbados. Hurricane Hunters confirmed the intensity, though the flight also reported a weakness of low-level inflow. Despite maintaining winds of just below hurricane-force, there was no evidence of an eyewall on radars as the storm approached the Lesser Antilles. Late on August 20, the storm moved across Martinique into the Caribbean Sea, during which its low-level circulation became disorganized. As Tropical Storm Dorothy moved further into the Caribbean Sea, it began a gradual weakening trend initiated by a persistent tropical upper tropospheric trough, as well as the presence of strong wind shear and a lack of inflow. Hurricane Hunter flights late on August 21 and early on August 22 failed to locate a closed low-level circulation, and as a result the storm was downgraded to a tropical depression. After another flight into the system could not detect a circulation, the NHC discontinued advisories on Dorothy to the south of Hispaniola late on August 22\\\\. Around the same time, thunderstorms increased in association with the cyclone, and forecasters remarked the potential for re-intensification over the western Caribbean Sea. However, the storm became more disorganized, and on August 23 Dorothy degenerated into a tropical wave. ==Preparations and impact== After the first tropical cyclone advisory was issued on Tropical Storm Dorothy, a hurricane watch and storm warning were issued for the Leeward Islands from Dominica northward. As its westward track became more apparent, the watches and warnings were extended southward to include Martinique and Saint Lucia. On Martinique, authorities released a statement that warned the public for the potential for strong winds, heavy rainfall, and rough waves. Also on the island, officials converted schools and government buildings into shelters for people in low-lying areas. As a result of the storm, the Martinique Aim√© C√©saire International Airport in Le Lamentin was closed. The storm dropped heavy rainfall while crossing the Lesser Antilles. In Martinique, the highest 24‚Äëhour total was 26.8 inches (680 mm) in Fourniols, which was twice the average rainfall for August. Additionally, the capital city of Fort-de-France reported 13.4 in (341 mm). There, the rainfall broke all records for durations up to 24 hours; about 1 inch (26 mm) fell in 5 minutes, and in one hour a station reported 6.02 inches (153 mm). The rainfall caused flooding and mudslides, as well as rivers exceeding their banks; several bridges collapsed during the storm, and many homes were washed away. During the passage of the storm, sustained winds on the island reached 67 mph (108 km/h), with gusts reaching 99 mph (160 km/h) in the Caravelle peninsula. Throughout the country, the storm destroyed 186 homes and left 700 people homeless. The passage of Dorothy left heavy crop damage on the island, totaling 32 million francs (1970 FRF, $5.8 million 1970 USD); a total of 3.75 mi¬≤ (9.72 km¬≤) of banana crop was destroyed, and 2.16 mi¬≤ (5.6 km¬≤) of sugar cane was destroyed. Damage on the island totaled 190 million francs (1970 FRF, $34 million 1970 USD). Tropical Storm Dorothy caused several deaths on Martinique, although the exact death toll is unknown. The National Hurricane Center reported 50 deaths, although the post event report provided by the French meteorological agency reported 44 people dead or missing. Most of the deaths were in Saint-Joseph, where 20 people drowned in the Riviere l'Or. Floodwater rescues had been made difficult due to washed out roads and poor communications after the storm. In addition to the deaths, several people were injured. After the passage of the storm, Martinique was temporarily left isolated, when communications were downed with other nearby islands. The French Red Cross distributed 500 blankets and one ton of condensed milk; the agency also sought international assistance. Elsewhere in the Lesser Antilles, the storm caused flooding and mudslides in Dominica. There, the storm caused one death, when flooding heavy rainfall washed out a bridge. Also, all of the capital city of Roseau lost power and water service due to the storm. In neighboring Guadeloupe, the storm left much of the banana crop destroyed. Later, after it entered the Caribbean Sea, small craft warnings were issued for the Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. In its review of the storm, the National Hurricane Center did not mention any damage in the Greater Antilles. ==See also== *Other tropical cyclones named Dorothy *Tropical Storm Erika ==References== Dorothy (1970) Dorothy Dorothy (1970) Dorothy (1970) Dorothy (1970) ","title":"Tropical Storm Dorothy"},{"id":"20205092","text":"Vinod Rai (born 23 May in parsa,Gazipur 1948) is a former IAS officer who served as the 11th Comptroller and Auditor General of India.

In February 2016, Rai was appointed the chairman of Banks Board Bureau (BBB), the body which advises the government on top- level appointments at public sector banks and ways to address the bad loans. ==United Nations Panel of External Auditors== He is the chairman of United Nations Panel of External Auditors http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/big-ticket- corruption-scandals-a-thing-of-past-former-cag-vinod-rai-759606 and member of the Governing Board of the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI). The United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon has appreciated the panel and the yeoman service rendered by the external auditors in improving governance in the United Nations system. The panel headed by Vinod Rai discussed the major business transformations currently under way in the United Nations with Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon. The Panel of External Auditors plays an important role in promoting accountability and strengthening governance mechanisms in the UN organisations. Mr. Rai has taken over as the chairman of Governing Board of the Asian Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (ASOSAI) on 29 February 2012. ==CAG of India== Forbes described Rai as being among that rare breed of civil servants who knows how to get work done in the government. A former colleague says Rai has an uncanny ability to cut through red tape. He was appointed as Comptroller and Auditor General of India with the backing of finance minister P. Chidambaram. But he has served up uncomfortable audit reports that have pinned many government departments beyond the baseline. He has consistently hit the headlines for his unforgiving audits, ranging from the scathing report on the shoddy preparation for the Commonwealth Games to the latest on spectrum allocations for second generation (2G) telecom services. Along with a vibrant media, an activist Supreme Court and an increasingly vociferous civil society, his supporters say, Rai has made his office into a powerful force for accountability and transparency in modern India. ==BCCI chief== * The Supreme Court nominated a four-member panel to look after the administration of the BCCI. * Former CAG Vinod Rai, historian Ramachandra Guha, banker Vikaram Limaye and former captain of women's cricket team Diana Edulji were to look after the BCCI's administration until formal elections were held. ==Reforms suggested by Vinod Rai== Vinod Rai recommended that all private-public partnerships (PPPs), \\"Panchayti Raj Institutions\\" and societies benefiting from government funds should come within the ambit of the CAG. The PPP model is a popular medium for the execution of infrastructure projects worth millions of rupees, and these projects are not audited by the CAG. 60 percent of government spending does not currently come under the scrutiny of the CAG. ==Major audits2G Spectrum allocation=== He is widely credited for the report on issue of Licences and Allocation of 2G Spectrum by United Progressive Alliance government which resulted in a huge controversy in India. The report estimated that there was a presumptive loss of . In a chargesheet filed on 2 April 2011 by the investigating agency Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), the agency pegged the loss at On 2 February 2012 the Supreme Court of India on a public interest litigation (PIL) declared allotment of spectrum as \\"unconstitutional and arbitrary\\" and quashed all the 122 licenses issued in 2008 during tenure of A. Raja (then minister for communications & IT in United Progressive Alliance) the main accused. The court further said that A. Raja \\"wanted to favour some companies at the cost of the public exchequer\\" and \\"virtually gifted away important national asset\\". However, the Presumptive Revenue loss calculation has never been established and has at best remained a conjecture. On 3 August 2012 when according to the directions of the Supreme Court, the Government of India revised the spectrum price to Rs 140 billion as reserve price for 2G spectrum and decided to sell airwaves in Delhi, Mumbai, Karnataka and Rajasthan for 1800 MHz band, and pan India for the 800 MHz band the response was poor, to say the least. The Government then announced that it would auction the unsold spectrum in the 1800 MHz band from the 2012 spectrum auction, immediately after the first round, which began on 11 March, got over to comply with a Supreme Court order. The government also reduced the reserve price for 1800 MHz by 30% and for 800 MHz by 50% from the 2012 spectrum auction. Response to the 2013 spectrum auction was also very poor. While there were no bidders for spectrum in 1800 MHz and 900 MHz bands, MTS India was the only bidder for airwaves in 800 MHz band. Airtel and Idea were reluctant to participate in the spectrum auction for due to steep pricing of the auction. The main criticism to the report now emerging is that the CAG exceeded its constitutional mandate as it attempted in a sense to change the policy of the Government of India which at that point was to promote telecom growth and not revenue maximisation by arguing that spectrum could only be sold by auction and creating figures for Presumtive losses around it. However, the Honble Supreme Court Of India in the Presidential Reference (2012) has upheld the right of the Government to frame policy and said \\"The norm of ‚Äúcommon good‚Äù has to be understood and appreciated in a holistic manner. The manner in which the common good is best subserved is not a matter that can be measured by any constitutional yardstick ‚Äî it depends on the economic and political philosophy of the government. Revenue maximization is not the only way in which the common good can be subserved. Where revenue maximization is the object of a policy, being considered qua that resource at that point of time to be the best way to subserve the common good, auction would be one of the preferable methods, though not the only method. Where revenue maximization is not the object of a policy of distribution, the question of auction would not arise. Revenue considerations may assume secondary consideration to developmental considerations. \\" 1 ===CoalGate (coal mines allocation)=Delhi Commonwealth Games 2010=Padmanabhaswamy Temple Audit=== Based on the recommendations by amicus curiae-senior advocate Gopal Subramaniam who was investigating the issues of financial irregularities and mismanagement in the Padmanabhaswamy Temple, the Supreme Court of India issued an interim order on 24 April 2014 stating that Mr Vinod Rai will supervise special audit of property of temple. Rai responded by saying that he felt \\"very humbled\\" and said \\"With all sincerity I will take up the task\\". ==Confrontation with Governments== As a part of his duty, Rai has many a times raised questions on faulty policy making of several state governments and Union government run by Congress led United Progressive Alliance and BJP led Governments in Chhattisgarh and Gujarat. He had slammed the Union government in the allocation of spectrum for 2G mobile use to telecom operators, conduct of the 2010 Commonwealth Games, running of its flagship rural employment guarantee scheme and the spending by Reliance Industries in KG D6 oil block. He had also pointed out improprieties in allocating coal blocks, and Union government's overt generosity to GMR in an airport project and Reliance Power in Sasan ultra mega power plant. CAG slammed the government of Goa for forest policy delay, and the Haryana government for loss of over due to \\"deficiency\\" in imposing taxes like sales tax on goods, stamp duty and registration fee in land deals and taxes on vehicles in more than 4,000 cases in a year. There are certain times when ministers of ruling Congress coalition government criticised CAG. Minister of state in PMO, V. Narayanasamy said \\"CAG has no authority or right to comment on the policy of the government but unfortunately it has questioned its authority, which is totally unwarranted and against the mandate given to them\\". However CAG Vinod Rai defended his position by stating at an Economic Editor's Conference in 2011 \\"I am making it clear that I do not think the CAG is exceeding its jurisdiction, because the basic responsibility of the CAG is to identify if there is any lapse,\\" and challenged the government to identify the specific breach of mandate. ==Published book== He wrote Not Just an Accountant: The Diary of the Nations Conscience Keeper, which speaks about how the political system was exploited to violate laws in 2G spectrum case, Krishna-Godavari gas basin contract, Commonwealth Games scam, Indian coal allocation scam and the controversial purchase of aircraft. ==Awards and recognition== {  style=\\"font-size:90%;\\" - !

Wapasha was built as the steel-hulled, single-screw tug William J. Moran, completed in September 1938 at Bay City, Michigan, by the Defoe Boat and Motor Works, Inc.. William J. Moran was acquired by the U.S. Navy from the Moran Towing and Transportation Company of New York City, 9 December 1940. The tug was classified as a yard net tender, renamed USS Wapasha, and designated YN-45 on 25 December 1940. Converted for naval use at the New York Navy Yard in Brooklyn, New York, Wapasha was placed in service on 27 January 1941. Wapasha was allocated to the 1st Naval District at Boston, Massachusetts, which became her home port. After shifting to Boston on 1 February 1941, she took up her net tending duties in Narragansett Bay, based at Naval Training Center Newport at Newport, Rhode Island. During her service there, which lasted into 1947, she was twice reclassified: on 8 April 1942 she was reclassified a tug-class net tender and redesignated YNT-13 and, on 4 August 1945, she was reclassified a large harbor tug and redesignated YTB-737. Placed out of service on 11 February 1947, Wapasha was struck from the Navy List on 11 March 1947 and turned over to the Maritime Commission for disposal on 16 May 1947. Acquired by Tug Anne Moran, Inc., of New York City, the vessel was renamed Anne Moran and performed harbor tug services in New York Harbor. She was sold in 1976 to Solvent Tanker Corporation of Staten Island, New York, and renamed Yankee. She later was sold again, to Eklof Marine Corporation of Staten Island. ==References== * *Wapasha (YTB-737) ex Wapasha (YNt-13) (1942 - 1945) Wapasha (YN-45) (1941 - 1942) Category:Net tenders of the United States Navy Category:Tugs of the United States Navy Category:United States Navy Minnesota- related ships Category:Ships built in Bay City, Michigan Category:1938 ships Category:World War II auxiliary ships of the United States ","title":"USS Wapasha (YN-45)"},{"id":"20205113","text":"Isa Quensel Isa Quensel (21 September 1905 - 3 November 1981) was a Swedish actress and operatic soprano who appeared in over 50 films, plays, operas, TV and radio shows.

Musa ibn Musa al-Qasawi also nicknamed the Great () (born circa 790 ‚Äì 26 September 862) was leader of the Muwallad Banu Qasi clan and ruler of a semi-autonomous principality in the upper Ebro valley in northern Iberia in the 9th century. ==Rise== Musa ibn Musa was descendant of Cassius, who converted to Islam after the Muslim conquest of Iberia. His father, Musa ibn Furtun, appears in scattered accounts of the late 8th century, and was apparently assassinated in Musa's youth. His mother, whose name is unknown, was also mother by another husband of Basque chieftain √ç√±igo Arista, Musa's half-brother. Musa's early years are obscure, although he is presumed to have supported the Basques against the Franks in the Second Battle of Ronceveaux, a battle generally credited as giving birth to the nascent Kingdom of Pamplona. Likewise it is claimed that in 839 his son Furtun ibn Musa led a campaign that resulted in a rout of the \\"king of the Gallaecians\\", \\"Loderik\\" or \\"Luzriq\\"\\"The barbarian Luzriq\\" (), identified by some with Rodrigo of Castile (although if so the incident appears to have been misdated) or with Alfonso II of Asturias. and he leveled the defenses of √Ålava. ==Rebellion== It is in 840/41 that we first hear of Musa ibn Musa himself. In response to attacks on the lands of his half-brother, √ç√±igo Arista, and the expulsion of kinsman Abd al-Jabbar ibn Qasi by the brothers Abd Allah and Amir ibn Kalayb, governors respectively of Zaragoza and Tudela, Musa and √ç√±igo rose in rebellion against emir Abd ar-Rahman II. This led to a reprisal campaign under the leadership of the emir's son, Mutarrif, and general Abd al-Wahid ibn Yazid Iskandarani. In 842, Musa was in charge of the vanguard of the emir's army marching against Cerdanya, but believing himself mistreated by the commanding general, Musa again rebelled and along with his nephew, Garc√≠a √ç√±iguez of Pamplona, defeated a Cordoban army. Musa ibn Musa and √ç√±igo √ç√±iguez again joined forces to ambush and capture one of Abd ar- Rahman's commanders in 843, al-Harit, but the consequence was a massive military response from C√≥rdoba, led by the Emir in person, resulting in the defeat of the allies and the taking of slaves in the vicinity of Pamplona. A second retaliatory expedition in 844 inflicted a further defeat, in which Fort√∫n √ç√±iguez, the premier soldier of Pamplona, was killed and Musa and √ç√±igo barely escaped, while hundreds of the Pamplona nobility defected to the Cordoban side. Musa submitted and in November led his troops to Seville, helping to defeat a large army of Viking raiders who had sacked the city. However, he again rebelled the next year. When Muhammad, son of Abd ar-Rahman, took Tudela, Musa submitted, offered his sons as hostages and went to the emir's court. In 846 Musa again was forced to submit, this time to the emir's son Hisham, but Abd ar-Rahman was again forced to launch punitive campaigns against Musa in 847, and in 850 when Musa and √ç√±igo again joined in rebellion, Musa's son Isma'il ibn Musa playing a critical role in the uprising. Throughout this time, Musa faced opposition from within his family. Ibn Hazm reports that his brother, Yunus ibn Musa, remained loyal to C√≥rdoba, and joined with the sons of their uncle Zahir ibn Fortun to fight Musa ibn Musa for most of his life, about 30 years. ==Third King of Spain== The Islamic year 237 (851/2) proved critical for Musa ibn Musa. In this year his half-brother and repeated ally in rebellion, √ç√±igo Arista, died, as did the emir, Abd er- Rahman II. Musa also gained a great victory in a two-day battle, defeating Basque or Gascon forces near Albelda. The next year, Musa's control over his territories and his links to the emirate were formalized, the new emir, Muhammad, naming Musa WƒÅli of Zaragoza and governor of the Upper March of Al- Andalus. The next decade marked the height of his power. He would control Zaragoza, Tudela, Huesca and Toledo, forming what was, in effect, a Taifa state stretching from N√°jera to Zaragoza and Calatayud, and viewed as equivalent to the emirate of C√≥rdoba and the Kingdom of Asturias, Musa being referred to as ‚ÄúThe Third King of Spain‚Äù.‚Äútertium regum in Spania‚Äù, i.e. Iberia. The hill of Monte Laturce today In 854, Toledo rebelled, supported by Ordo√±o I of Asturias and Garc√≠a √ç√±iguez, and the emir Muhammad launched a punitive campaign which ended in the Battle of Guadalacete, Musa apparently participating on C√≥rdoba's behalf. The next year(855) Musa led a Cordoban attack on √Ålava, in the southeastern section of the Kingdom of Asturias, and in 856 he launched an independent expedition against Barcelona and Terrassa. Apparently in 859, Musa's son Lubb ibn Musa ibn Qasi was appointed Wali of Toledo, and the same year, Musa permitted a Viking force to pass through his lands to attack Pamplona, where they captured Musa's nephew and former ally Garc√≠a √ç√±iguez and ransomed him for either 70,000 or 90,000 gold dinars. This further soured relations between the kinsmen, and Garc√≠a joined with Ordo√±o in an assault on Musa's lands, which led to a second battle at Albelda. The Christians divided their forces, besieging the town and pursuing Musa‚Äôa army to a refuge on Mount Laturce. They dealt Musa a crushing defeat, killing his son-in-law, an otherwise unknown Basque prince Garc√≠a, and forcing Musa to flee. This victory would be remembered in Christian sources in the form of the legendary Battle of Clavijo. ==Decline and Death== The Christian victory at Albeda led to the end of Musa's autonomy. In 860, emir Muhammad removed Musa as wali and governor, and personally led an army through Musa‚Äôa lands on a month-long punitive campaign against Pamplona which resulted in the capture of prince Fort√∫n Garc√©s of Pamplona. In 861, Muhammad required Musa to play a subservient role in a campaign against Barcelona. The next year, 862, saw Musa trying to re-exert his power, directing a military show of force against his son-in-law, the Berber Azraq ibn Mantil ibn Salim (). Musa attacked Guadalajara, but received several wounds, being unable to mount a horse. He withdrew to Tutila, where he died 26 September 862. ==Family== Musa ibn Musa is reported by the C√≥dice de Roda to have married a daughter of his half- brother √ç√±igo Arista. She was not his only wife, as he also married a cousin Maymuna (), daughter of his paternal uncle Zahir ibn Furtun and mother of his younger son Isma'il. No source reports the mother of his other sons: Lubb, Mutarrif and Furtun. He had at least two daughters; Auria (, Awriyah), wife of Basque prince Garcia, killed at Mount Laturce, and by him having a son Musa ibn Garshiya; and another daughter, \\"the most beautiful girl in Al-Andalus\\", married to Azraq ibn Mantil. ==Legacy== The death of Musa led to a decade-long disappearance of the family from the political scene but it returned to rule over a shrinking territory for another half-century. However, their position between the growing powers of the caliphate to the south and the Christian principalities to the north proved untenable, and after three generations of varied success, the leaders of the family, Musa's great-great grandsons, were displaced, exiled or killed by the end of the 920s and the last vestiges of Musa's principality disappeared. His pseudo-autonomy from a C√≥rdoba unable to maintain direct control foreshadowed the Muwallad rebels of the early 10th century and the later Taifa kingdoms. ==NotesReferences== * * *Ibn Hazm, Jamharat ansab al-'Arab *Levi-Proven√ßal, Histoire de l'Espagne Musulmane * * Category:862 deaths Category:People of the Emirate of C√≥rdoba Category:Basque history Category:9th-century Al-Andalus people Category:Banu Qasi Category:8th-century births Category:9th-century rulers in Europe Category:Upper March ","title":"Musa ibn Musa ibn Qasi"},{"id":"20205157","text":"Wapasha may refer to: ;People *A succession of Mdewakanton Sioux chiefs **Wapasha I (1718-1806) **Wapasha II (1768‚Äì1855) **Wapasha III (¬±1816-1876), also known as Joseph Wapasha **Wapasha IV, also known as Napoleon Wapasha ;Ships *USS Wapasha (YN-45), later YNT-13, later YTB-737, a United States Navy net tender, later large harbor tug, in service from 1941 to 1947 ","title":"Wapasha"},{"id":"20205176","text":"Russell Frederick Phillips (September 17, 1888 in Rat Portage, Ontario - August 22, 1949 in Vancouver, British Columbia) was a Canadian ice hockey player.

She had fixed her daughter Jiaoyan's marriage so that she end up with someone who was more financially stable. The daughter however was extremely unhappy since the fixed husband was fat and unattractive. The daughter was actually in love with the poor coolie boy A'long. However society would not allow a girl of reputable social status to marry a boy of low social status. The oldest brother of the family Che Weiren later committed a murder. He has been spoiled by the family riches. When the government was looking for the murderer, the coolie boy A'long innocently admitted to the crime so the brother didn't have to go to prison. Eventually the house got weak in morale. A fisherman named Gao Lixiang came in to help the Che family business. At first he was looked down upon due to his low society status. Soon he figured out how to dye clothes. He single handed won an imperial clothing competition by making through the obstacle course with his dyed clothes. The Che family was surprised that a simple fisherman could beat the business. Then one day a major fire broke out in a restaurant and Lixiang saved a daughter and a westerner from the crisis. The daughter turned out to be from the competing Wang family business. She tried to lure him into their family claiming the Che family treats him unfairly. After a number of business competitions he was gaining more respect in the Che family. Eventually the siblings got jealous and tried to get Lixiang kicked out of the household. Eventually the mother made Lixiang the head of the business, since he was most capable. Eventually the business was in trouble from all the competition. But the westerner who was saved in the fire came back with a bunch of goods from the west such as magnifying glass and music boxes. They started selling western goods and the business improved again, since no one else have seen these merchandise. Later the family went into a feud between the oldest son Che Weiren and Lixiang. In setting Lixiang up, the oldest son killed an outsider, Bai Biao, who later turned out to be his own genetic father. After a number of twists Lixiang was promoted to be the chairman of the business association above all businesses, but he was put in the chairman position because the government official liked his former fianc√©e Yang Danping. The oldest brother in the family soon developed a deep jealousy over the Lixiang's success who now owns his family business, his girlfriend Xu Xiaoman and his mother's trust. He sank into depression with opium addictions, and was later bribed by a government official to sell out his whole family business in exchange for unlimited opium. The mother of the family ended up in prison having been set up by the government officials. But her kids did not stand by her since they experienced too much hardship during their childhood. Lixiang ended up rescuing the family business, but soon finds the business to be unmanageable. Worse is that the mother who ran the business indirectly murdered his parents earlier. The story experience more twists and turns eventually to include the death of Qing government officials. ==Cast== { width=70% - !width=15% Cast !!width=15% Role !!width=40% Description - Eric Wang  Gao Lixiang È´òÁ´ãÁøî  Main character.

He grew up on Gould Street, near the Mutual Street rink. Giroux had been working since at least the age of 17 (he had a job feeding newsprint into the press at a Toronto trade paper), but he also played hockey. Giroux began his hockey career at a young age. He was a member of the Marlboros junior team that reached the OHA finals in 1902-03, and also of the intermediate team that won the provincial championship that year. He first appeared in the Stanley Cup playoffs in February 1904, at the age of 20, while playing for the OHA senior champion Toronto Marlboros. Toronto played against the Ottawa Silver Seven, who beat Toronto in the first game 6-3 and 11-2 in the second game (best-of- three format). A Toronto Star story on September 13, 1904 notes that Giroux had taken up residence in Rat Portage (later Kenora), Ontario the hometown of his Marlboros teammate Tommy Phillips who had returned home that May. Giroux and Phillips played with the Kenora Thistles in 1905. Kenora played for the Stanley Cup, but lost two games to one to Ottawa. In January 1907 Kenora again played for the Stanley Cup, and with Giroux in net, Kenora defeated the Montreal Wanderers 12-8 over two games to win.\\"The Thistle Hockey Team Wins The Stanley Cup\\" Lake of the Woods Museum Each player received a gold-plated cup for winning the Stanley Cup. Giroux was in net when Kenora defeated Brandon on March 16 and 18, to win the Manitoba Championship and retained the Stanley Cup. However, about a week later the Montreal Wanderers regained the Stanley Cup from Kenora in two games in Winnipeg. Because Kenora was unable to compete with other professional teams, it folded in 1908, and Giroux retired as a player. When Kenora challenged the Winnipeg Victorias for the Allan Cup in March 1911, Giroux officiated along with long-time friend Tommy Phillips. Winnipeg won the Allan Cup, out scoring Kenora 12-5. ==References * Category:1883 births Category:1930 deaths Category:Canadian ice hockey forwards Category:Sportspeople from Toronto Category:Kenora Thistles players Category:Stanley Cup champions Category:Ice hockey people from Ontario ","title":"Eddie Giroux"},{"id":"20205256","text":"This agreement is officially known as the Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste relating to the Unitisation of the Sunrise and Troubadour Fields.Full text of agreement available from the Australasian Legal Information Institute's Australian Treaty Series database at The Sunrise International Unitisation Agreement (Sunrise IUA) was made to enable the exploitation of the Sunrise and Troubador petroleum and gas fields in the Timor Sea, together known as the Greater Sunrise field. The Greater Sunrise field straddles the border between the joint petroleum development area (JPDA) established under the Timor Sea Treaty and Australian territorial waters as determined by the 1972 seabed boundary agreement between Australia and Indonesia. Unitisation of the field would enable it to be treated as one as far as exploitation, regulation, revenue taxation, management and other purposes are concerned, giving certainty to investors by providing a financial framework and international legal basis for development of the field. The agreement deemed 20.1% of the resources of the Greater Sunrise field as lying within the JPDA, attributing 20.1% of production from it to the JPDA and 79.9% to Australia. With East Timor getting 90% of the revenue of the JPDA, it effectively was only going to receive 18.1% of the revenue from the field. This share ratio was amended to both Australia and East Timor getting equal share of the upstream revenue from the field with the signing of the Treaty on Certain Maritime Arrangements in the Timor Sea (CMATS) in 2006. By virtue of this, this agreement is \\"read together\\" with CMATS and the Timor Sea Treaty. The Sunrise IUA was signed in Dili, East Timor on 6 March 2003 by then Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs Alexander Downer and Ana Pessoa, East Timor's Minister of State for the Presidency of the Council of Ministers. The agreement came into force on 23 February 2007 by virtue of the coming to force of CMATS on the same day. ==See also== *Treaty on Certain Maritime Arrangements in the Timor Sea (CMATS) *Timor Sea Treaty ==References== Category:Timor Sea Category:Commercial treaties Category:Joint development areas Category:Treaties of Australia Category:Treaties of East Timor Category:Treaties concluded in 2003 Category:Treaties entered into force in 2007 Category:Energy in East Timor Category:Petroleum in Australia Category:Australia‚ÄìEast Timor border Category:Australia‚ÄìEast Timor relations ","title":"Sunrise International Unitization Agreement"},{"id":"20205262","text":"The Jewish Sports Hall of Fame may refer to: *The International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in Netanya, Israel *The National Jewish Museum Sports Hall of Fame in Commack, New York *The Orange County Jewish Sports Hall of Fame at the Merage Jewish Community Center in Irvine, California *The Southern California Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in Beverley Hills, California ","title":"Jewish Sports Hall of Fame"},{"id":"20205280","text":"Wapasha (II) (1768-1855) was the name of a Mdewakanton Dakota chief.

The station is owned by Entercom through licensee Entercom License, LLC and broadcasts a sports format with local shows most of the day and programming from CBS Sports Radio during the evening and overnight hours. Studios are located in Towson, Maryland while the transmitter is located in Baltimore's Frankford neighborhood at (). ==HistoryHistory of the WJZ-FM callsign=== The call letters WJZ-FM were originally used on what is now WPLJ in New York City from its founding in 1948 to 1953 when the station became WABC-FM, alongside WABC-TV and WABC (AM). The call letters \\"WJZ\\" were originally created by the Westinghouse Electric Corporation, the direct predecessor to the current CBS Corporation. Westinghouse was the owner of WJZ radio in Newark, New Jersey from 1921 to 1923, before it moved to New York. The \\"JZ\\" in the call sign referred to New Jersey. The WJZ call letters have been used in Baltimore since 1957, when WAAM (channel 13) was renamed to WJZ-TV, an ABC Network affiliate that was changed to CBS in 1995. ===Early years=== WJZ-FM signed on November 22, 1963 as WCBC, owned by Christian Broadcasting Company. The station was purchased on March 6, 1968, by Key Broadcasting, who changed its call sign to WBMD-FM. The FM station was paired with a country AM station, WBMD, already owned by Key. In 1970, the FM's format became hard rock at night, with country during the day. On July 5, 1971, the station's call sign was changed to WKTK and the format shifted to all progressive rock music. From 1977 to 1979, WKTK played disco music, but later changed to oldies with the decline of disco. In 1982, the call letters became WQSR as the station planned to join Super Radio, a new national music network to be operated by ABC. Shortly before Super Radio's scheduled launch, ABC decided not to go forward with the network. WQSR kept its new call letters. WQSR was then sold to Sconnix Broadcasting in 1988 and continued playing oldies music. The station was sold to Infinity Radio in 1993, then passed on to CBS Radio in 1997. ===WXYV=== On September 8, 2001, at 6 a.m., WQSR moved to WXYV's 102.7 FM frequency to broadcast on a better signal. After two days of simulcasting, at 3 p.m. on September 10, 105.7 FM became the new home for WXYV, with an urban contemporary music format known as \\"X105.7.\\" (X105.7 marked WXYV's second stint as an urban station; the first incarnation was known as \\"V103\\", which flipped to CHR/Top-40 and became \\"102.7XYV\\" in 1997, and was then re-branded as \\"B102.7\\" in 1998, with the same CHR/Top-40 format.) The call letter swap between the two stations became official 4 days later.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/2000s/2001/RR-2001-09-21.pdf Both stations were owned by Infinity Broadcasting (now CBS Radio). The morning show was a simulcast of former V103 and 92Q personality Frank Ski's morning show, originating from WVEE (also known as \\"V103\\", but located on the 103.3 frequency) in Atlanta. ===Revival of WHFS=== However, X105.7 failed to compete against WERQ-FM, which resulted in WXYV flipping to hot talk on March 10, 2003.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/2000s/2003/RR-2003-03-14.pdf The station was an affiliate for Howard Stern and the Don and Mike Show. The station adopted the name \\"Live 105.7\\", which would later change to \\"105.7 Free FM\\" in 2006, and then \\"Baltimore's FM Talk 105.7\\" in 2007 after CBS phased out the Free FM branding nationwide. This logo was used during WHFS's talk radio incarnation. Meanwhile, Infinity Broadcasting saw an unexpected public reaction to their decision to change the format of 99.1 FM in Washington. The story was covered by local TV stations for many days afterwards, and mentioned nationally by The Washington Post, The Howard Stern Show, and The Today Show. The corporate offices of Infinity Broadcasting in New York City were flooded with phone calls and e-mails from irate listeners. An online petition protesting the format change gathered tens of thousands of signatures in only a few days. Media attention was attracted by a public protest in downtown Washington, outside a skate shop where WHFS maintained a remote storefront studio in its last few months. WHFS' main competitor, DC101, paid tribute to the station, airing many memories of WHFS from its DJs and listeners. Infinity Broadcasting responded by resurrecting the WHFS format on nights and weekends at 105.7, beginning at 7 p.m. on January 21, 2005 with former WHFS afternoon DJ Tim Virgin. The station rebranded itself as \\"The Legendary HFS, Live on 105.7\\"; Infinity Broadcasting moved the WHFS call letters to the station days later. 'HFS was pulled from the airwaves again on February 1, 2007, immediately before KMS on HFS premiered, yet retained the WHFS call letters traditionally associated with the music the station used to broadcast. Currently, HFS2 and Locals Only with Neci remain WHFS's only ties to its original format. ===HFS2=== In 2006, WHFS began to broadcast a digital signal for radios using the new HD Radio technology, and launched an all-music station named \\"HFS2\\" on its second HD Radio channel. The station focuses primarily on new alternative rock and indie rock, and currently has no DJs or commercials. On January 19, 2007, the online stream of \\"HFS2\\" was launched with the slogan \\"What You've Been Missing\\" hinting at the death of HFS music on the regular 105.7 frequency. On Thursday, November 1, 2007, Neci Crowder began broadcasting on HFS2 from 8am to 1 pm. This marked the first time a live DJ has been heard on HFS2. ===105.7 the Fan=== On November 3, 2008, WHFS flipped to a sports talk format, branded as \\"105.7 The Fan.\\"https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/baltsun/doc/406216404.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS;=ABS:FT&type;=current&date;=Nov+4%2C+2008&author;=Kaltenbach%2C+Chris&pub;=The+Baltimore+Sun&edition;=&startpage;=&desc;=SOMETHING+TO+TALK+ABOUT%3A+105.7+FM+SWITCHES+TO+SPORTS Along with the format change came a new callsign: WJZ-FM. The new station has Ed Norris and Rob Long in the morning drive (\\"Norris & Long Show\\" 5:30-10 AM), Bob Haynie and Vinny Cerrato (\\"Vinny & Haynie Show\\" from 10 AM to 2 PM), and Scott Garceau and Jeremy Conn (\\"Scott Garceau Show\\" from 2 to 6 PM. WJZ-FM retained WHFS' status as the flagship radio station for Baltimore Orioles baseball and Maryland Terrapins football and men's basketball. The WHFS call sign landed on 1580 AM (formerly WPGC) one week later. Orioles broadcasts moved from WJZ-FM back to WBAL (which WHFS had replaced as flagship in 2007) in 2011. But in 2015, WJZ-FM reacquired the broadcast rights to Orioles games from WBAL for the second time. On February 2, 2017, CBS agreed to merge CBS Radio with Entercom, currently the fourth-largest radio broadcaster in the United States; the sale will be conducted using a Reverse Morris Trust so that it will be tax-free. While CBS shareholders retain a 72% ownership stake in the combined company, Entercom was surviving entity, separating WJZ radio (both 105.7 FM and AM 1300) from WJZ-TV. The merger was approved on November 9, 2017, and was consummated on the 17th. However, despite no longer sharing an owner with WJZ-TV, the deal grants the station the right to use the call letters in perpetuity. ==Signal note== WJZ-FM is short-spaced to WQXA-FM 105.7 The X (licensed to serve York, Pennsylvania) as they operate on the same frequency and the cities they are licensed to serve are only 48 miles apart. The minimum distance between two Class B stations operating on the same channel according to current FCC rules is 150 miles. Both stations use directional antennas to reduce their signals toward each other. ==References External links == * * Category:Catonsville, Maryland JZ Category:Sports radio stations in the United States Category:American Basketball Association flagship radio stations Category:Baltimore Orioles broadcasters Category:Radio stations established in 1963 Category:1963 establishments in Maryland Category:American radio stations with a three-letter call sign Category:CBS Sports Radio stations Category:Entercom radio stations ","title":"WJZ-FM"},{"id":"20205321","text":"Wapasha, c. 1860.

The match took place on November 22, 2009, at Qwest Field in Seattle, Washington, and was contested between the Los Angeles Galaxy and Real Salt Lake. Real Salt Lake won the match 5‚Äì4 in a penalty shootout following a 1‚Äì1 draw. Salt Lake goalkeeper Nick Rimando was named man of the match for making several saves in the shootout, allowing defender Robbie Russell to score the winning goal. It was the club's first championship, coming in their fifth season in the league, and the second MLS Cup to be decided by a shootout. An attendance of 46,011 people made the 2009 final the fourth-largest in MLS Cup history. It was also the first MLS Cup to be played on artificial turf. The match was broadcast in the United States on ESPN and Galavisi√≥n. ==Venue and pre-match== Qwest Field was chosen as host venue of MLS Cup 2009 Qwest Field was announced as the venue for the MLS Cup on March 11, 2009, a week before Seattle Sounders FC played their inaugural match at the stadium. Qwest Field became the eighth stadium to host the MLS Cup and the first new stadium chosen for the final since 2005. The selection of a venue with an artificial turf playing surface, a first for the MLS Cup, was criticized by several players prior to the final. Qwest Field was built for the Seattle Seahawks of the National Football League in 2003, but was designed with soccer in mind. It hosted several international friendly matches, as well as part of the 2005 CONCACAF Gold Cup, prior to becoming the home stadium of the Seattle Sounders. Due to the use of Qwest Field as the MLS Cup venue, the Seattle Seahawks schedule was modified to include three away games in November. In their inaugural season, the Sounders set the league record for average attendance, with 30,897, prompting additional interest in the cup. The initial offering of 30,000 tickets were sold out in early November, prompting the release of 6,000 additional tickets. Ticket sales passed 40,000 on the day before the match. To celebrate the MLS Cup final, the logos of the league and the two finalists were painted onto the roof of the city's iconic Space Needle. The Philip F. Anschutz Trophy was brought to the city aboard a state ferry by Sounders coach Sigi Schmid and technical director Chris Henderson. Other pre-cup festivities included a free concert by rock band Third Eye Blind, a summit of supporters representing several MLS clubs, a March to the Match from Pioneer Square, and a \\"Soccer Celebration\\" festival outside the stadium plaza. ==Road to the final== The MLS Cup is the post-season championship of Major League Soccer (MLS), a professional club soccer league in the United States and Canada. The 2009 season was the 14th in MLS history, and was contested by 15 teams in two conferences. Each club played 30 matches during the regular season from March to October, facing each team twice and two in-conference teams a third time. The playoffs, running from October 29 to November 22, were contested by the top two clubs in each conference and four wild card teams in the next positions regardless of conference. It was organized into three rounds: a home-and-away series in the Conference Semifinals, a single-match Conference Final, and the MLS Cup final. The 2009 edition of the MLS Cup was contested by the Los Angeles Galaxy and Real Salt Lake. The two teams were from the Western Conference, marking the second consecutive edition to be played between two teams from the same conference. The Galaxy and Real Salt Lake played each other twice in the regular season: a 2‚Äì2 draw hosted by Real Salt Lake in May and a 2‚Äì0 loss for hosts Los Angeles in June. ===Los Angeles Galaxy=== The Western Conference Final, played against the Houston Dynamo at the Home Depot Center in Carson, California The Los Angeles Galaxy were one of the original teams in MLS and appeared in five previous MLS Cup finals, winning in 2002 and 2005. The team finished joint- last in the league in 2008, replacing manager Ruud Gullit with former United States national team coach Bruce Arena midway through the season. In the 2009 SuperDraft, the Galaxy selected Omar Gonzalez and A. J. DeLaGarza, both of whom would lead a revamped defense alongside newly-acquired goalkeeper Donovan Ricketts. Though without star midfielder David Beckham due to an extended loan to A.C. Milan, the Galaxy began the season with one loss and two wins in their first twelve matches. After Beckham's return in July, the team went on a six- match unbeaten streak and secured a playoff berth in late August. The Galaxy finished the season with 12 wins, 6 losses, and 12 draws, placing first in the Western Conference with 48 points. The Galaxy played the Western Conference Semifinals against Chivas USA, the co-tenant of the Home Depot Center appearing in their fourth consecutive playoffs. The first leg ended in a 2‚Äì2 draw, marked by four goals that were the result of defensive mistakes by both teams. The Galaxy advanced to the Conference Final after winning 1‚Äì0 in the second leg, with Landon Donovan scoring the lone goal from a penalty kick. The Western Conference Final was played against the Houston Dynamo and hosted by the Galaxy at the Home Depot Center. The match was interrupted by two power outages in both halves of regulation time, which ended scoreless after a Dynamo goal in the 80th minute was disallowed. Defender Gregg Berhalter scored in the 103rd minute and was followed six minutes later by a Landon Donovan penalty to give the Galaxy a 2‚Äì0 win and a place in the MLS Cup final. ===Real Salt Lake=== Real Salt Lake entered MLS as an expansion team in 2005, but failed to qualify for the playoffs in its first three seasons. Veteran midfielder Jason Kreis, who had scored the franchise's first goal, was appointed head coach after six straight losses to begin the 2007 season and worked with new general manager Garth Lagerwey to rebuild the team. After acquiring several key players in 2008, including captain Kyle Beckerman, and defenders Nat Borchers and J√°mison Olave, the team qualified for the playoffs and advanced to the Western Conference Final, where they were defeated by the New York Red Bulls. Salt Lake began the 2009 season, their first to be fully played at Rio Tinto Stadium and fifth overall, with nine home wins, five draws, and one loss. The team failed to produce similar results in away matches and finished with a losing record of 11 wins, 12 losses, and 7 draws. Real Salt Lake qualified for the playoffs on the last day of the season with 40 points, thanks to favorable results from three matches that eliminated five other teams competing for the final two wild card spots. As a wild card, the team was seeded into the Eastern Conference Semifinals against the Columbus Crew, the defending MLS Cup champions. Real Salt Lake won the home leg 1‚Äì0 on a goal by Robbie Findley, but conceded two early goals in the opening 35 minutes of the away leg in Columbus. The team responded with three goals scored by Javier Morales, Findley, and Andy Williams to win 3‚Äì2 and advanced 4‚Äì2 on aggregate. Real Salt Lake faced the Chicago Fire in the Eastern Conference Final at Toyota Park in Bridgeview, Illinois, which ended in a scoreless draw after extra time. Salt Lake won the ensuing penalty shootout 5‚Äì4 after seven rounds, relying on three saves by goalkeeper Nick Rimando. Real Salt Lake became the third MLS Cup finalist to have qualified for the playoffs as the lowest seed, mirroring the New York Red Bulls the previous year, and was the second expansion team to contest an MLS Cup. ===Summary of results=== :Note: In all results below, the score of the finalist is given first (H: home; A: away). {   - !colspan=4Real Salt Lake !Round !colspan=4LA Galaxy - colspan=4 valign=top5th place in Western Conference {  style=\\"text-align:center; margin:0; font-size: 95%\\" - !width=\\"20\\" ! style=\\"width:175px;\\"Team !width=\\"20\\" !width=\\"20\\" !width=\\"20\\" !width=\\"20\\" !width=\\"20\\" -FFFFCD;\\" 3align=leftSeattle Sounders FC30 1271147 -FFFFCD;\\" 4align=leftChivas USA30 1311645 -FFFFCD;\\" 5align=leftReal Salt Lake30 1112740 - 6align=leftColorado Rapids30 10101040 - 7align=leftFC Dallas30 1113639 } c1e0ff\\"Regular season colspan=4 valign=top1st place in Western Conference {  style=\\"text-align:center; margin:0; font-size: 95%\\" - !width=\\"20\\" ! style=\\"width:175px;\\"Team !width=\\"20\\" !width=\\"20\\" !width=\\"20\\" !width=\\"20\\" !width=\\"20\\" -FFFEBB;\\" 1align=leftLA Galaxy30 1261248 -FFFEBB;\\" 2align=leftHouston Dynamo30 138948 -FFFFCD;\\" 3align=leftSeattle Sounders FC30 1271147 -FFFFCD;\\" 4align=leftChivas USA30 1311645 -FFFFCD;\\" 5align=leftReal Salt Lake30 1112740 } - c1e0ff\\" Opponent  1st leg 2nd leg MLS Cup Playoffs Opponent  1st leg 2nd leg - align=leftColumbus Crew 4‚Äì2 1‚Äì0 (H) 3‚Äì2 (A) c1e0ff\\"Conference Semifinals align=leftChivas USA 3‚Äì2 2‚Äì2 (H) 1‚Äì0 (A) - align=leftChicago Fire colspan=30‚Äì0 (5‚Äì4 p) (A) c1e0ff\\"Conference Final align=leftHouston Dynamo colspan=32‚Äì0 (H) } ==Broadcasting== The MLS Cup final was televised in the United States on ESPN and ESPN360.com in English and Galavisi√≥n in Spanish. GolTV Canada broadcast the match in Canada, and ESPN International carried the match in 122 countries, primarily in Latin America, the Middle East, and Oceania. This was the first edition of the MLS Cup to be carried on a cable network, as the previous thirteen were on ABC, and was scheduled later at night to compete with NBC Sunday Night Football. ESPN covered the match using 19 cameras and several digital features, including player tracking statistics and an offside line displayed on instant replays. JP Dellacamera was the lead play-by-play commentator and John Harkes provided color commentary. The network's coverage of the final was later criticized by Salt Lake City-area media outlets for its favoritism of the Galaxy. ==MatchSummary=== A view of the match from the stands The Galaxy were described as the favorites in the MLS Cup match-up, with a better set of players and manager Bruce Arena's previous cup victories with D.C. United. Both teams fielded their regular lineups, with no major injuries; David Beckham was forced to skip several practice sessions prior to being injected with a painkiller to alleviate a bruised right ankle. Kevin Stott was named the head referee for his third MLS Cup final, following the 2001 and 2005 finals. Despite a forecast of rain, the weather at kickoff was cloudy and the air temperature was . During the first half, the Galaxy had the majority of possession and chances on goal, taking six shots. Real Salt Lake midfielder Javier Morales was substituted in the 22nd minute after suffering from a torn meniscus in his left knee after a collision with David Beckham; Morales left the field in tears and was replaced by Clint Mathis. After two missed opportunities, Los Angeles forward Mike Magee scored the final's opening goal in the 41st minute, finishing a cross from Landon Donovan. At halftime, the Galaxy led 1‚Äì0 and Real Salt Lake were forced to substitute midfielder Will Johnson, who was suffering from food poisoning contracted days earlier. Real Salt Lake regrouped in the second half and set up a chance in the 47th minute for Robbie Findley, who collided with Omar Gonzalez and Galaxy goalkeeper Donovan Ricketts. After being clipped by Gonzalez's right foot, Ricketts broke his right hand but elected to continue playing after being evaluated by on- field trainers. Salt Lake continued attacking and Findley scored the equalizing goal in the 64th minute by finishing a deflected shot from Yura Movsisyan. Ricketts walked off the field and was substituted in the 66th minute for his backup Josh Saunders in what was the first goalkeeper substitution in MLS Cup history. Both teams exchanged several chances late in the second half, including misses from Movsisyan and Donovan, but neither could score a second goal. The half ended with seven minutes of stoppage time due to Ricketts' treatment. In extra time, Real Salt Lake continued to have the majority of possession and chances, eventually tallying nineteen shots to the Galaxy's thirteen. Shots by Findley and Mathis were blocked and sent wide of the goal, grazing the outside of the side net. The match remained tied after extra time, leaving the MLS Cup to be decided through a penalty shootout for the second time in its history. The shootout began with David Beckham, who scored on his attempt, and was followed by successful penalties taken by Clint Mathis for Salt Lake, Gregg Berhalter for the Galaxy, and Findley for Salt Lake. With the score tied 2‚Äì2, Salt Lake goalkeeper Nick Rimando saved an attempt by Jovan Kirovski, and Saunders saved a kick by Salt Lake captain Kyle Beckerman. Despite his proficiency in penalties, Landon Donovan missed by putting it over the goalpost, and Ned Grabavoy scored to give Salt Lake a 3‚Äì2 lead going into the final rounds. Magee scored to keep the Galaxy in the shootout and an attempt by Salt Lake midfielder Andy Williams was saved by Saunders to trigger sudden death rounds. Williams was chosen as the final kick taker for Salt Lake by manager Jason Kreis because of the emotional connection to the team and Seattle that he had due to his wife's then-ongoing battle with a rare form of leukemia, which was being treated in Seattle. Chris Klein and Chris Wingert both scored their respective penalties, bringing the score to 4‚Äì4 before Rimando saved an attempt by Galaxy forward Edson Buddle. Salt Lake defender Robbie Russell scored the winning penalty in the seventh round, bringing the score to 5‚Äì4. After scoring the penalty, he turned around and fell to his knees as he was swarmed by his teammates. ===Details=== { width=92%  -   } { width=\\"100%\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" { style=\\"font-size: 90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" colspan=\\"4\\"REAL SALT LAKE: - !width=25 !!width=25 - GK 18  Nick Rimando - DF 4 J√°mison Olave - DF 6  Nat Borchers  - DF 3  Robbie Russell   - DF 17  Chris Wingert - MF 11 Javier Morales   - MF 5 Kyle Beckerman (c) - MF 77 Andy Williams - MF 8 Will Johnson   - FW 9 Yura Movsisyan   - FW 10  Robbie Findley - colspan=3Substitutes: - GK 1 Chris Seitz - DF 2 Tony Beltran - MF 12 Jean Alexandre - MF 20 Ned Grabavoy   - MF 84 Clint Mathis   - FW 16 Fabi√°n Esp√≠ndola   - FW 19 Pablo Campos - colspan=3Manager: - colspan=4 Jason Kreis } valign=\\"top\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" { style=\\"font-size: 90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" align=center colspan=\\"4\\"LOS ANGELES GALAXY: - !width=25 !!width=25 - GK 1  Donovan Ricketts   - LB 2  Todd Dunivant  - CB 16  Gregg Berhalter  - CB 4 Omar Gonzalez   - RB 28 Sean Franklin - RM 10 Landon Donovan (c) - CM 23  David Beckham  - CM 33 Chris Birchall   - LM 18 Mike Magee - FW 14  Edson Buddle  - FW 9 Jovan Kirovski - colspan=3Substitutes: - GK 12 Josh Saunders   - DF 5 Yohance Marshall - DF 20 A.

The 2009 final was the second in MLS Cup history to be won by an expansion team and the second to finish with a penalty shootout. Nick Rimando was named the MLS Cup most valuable player, only the second goalkeeper to earn the honor, and Jason Kreis became the youngest coach to win the MLS Cup, along with the fourth former player to coach a championship team. The 2009 final was attended by 46,011 spectators, then the fourth-largest crowd for an MLS Cup final and the largest since the 2002 final at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts. Approximately 2,000 fans attended from Salt Lake City and were joined by Seattle Sounders FC supporters, who chose to root for the \\"underdog\\" team. The crowd and atmosphere at the stadium were praised by league officials (including executive Don Garber), the teams, and the media. The stadium, later renamed CenturyLink Field, hosted its second MLS Cup final in 2019, which saw the Sounders defeat Toronto FC in front of 69,274 spectators‚Äîa stadium record for a sporting event. The Real Salt Lake team returned the following afternoon and was greeted by hundreds of fans at Salt Lake City International Airport. The team was honored by a reception at the Utah Governor's Mansion and the Utah State Capitol, culminating in a parade from the state capitol to a rally at Rio Tinto Stadium attended by 5,000 fans. Governor Gary R. Herbert declared November 24, 2009, as Real Salt Lake Day. The team was later honored with a traditional champion's ceremony at the White House by President Barack Obama on June 4, 2010. Real Salt Lake qualified for the 2010‚Äì11 CONCACAF Champions League, where they became the first MLS team to reach the modern tournament's finals, losing 3‚Äì2 on aggregate to C.F. Monterrey. Real Salt Lake would later return to the MLS Cup final in 2013, finishing as runners-up to Sporting Kansas City after losing a penalty shootout. The Galaxy and Real Salt Lake met in the 2011 Western Conference Final, where Los Angeles won 3‚Äì1 and advanced to the MLS Cup final and win their first championship since 2005. Los Angeles would also win the cup in 2012 and 2014, bringing their total number of MLS Cup championships to five and surpassing the record set by D.C. United. ==References== 2009 * Category:LA Galaxy matches Category:Real Salt Lake matches Category:Association football penalty shoot-outs Category:Sports competitions in Seattle Category:Soccer in Washington (state) Category:November 2009 sports events in the United States Category:2009 in sports in Washington (state) Category:2009 in Seattle ","title":"MLS Cup 2009"},{"id":"20205339","text":"The Battle of Tor√† was a defensive battle of the Reconquista, fought between an alliance of Catalan counts and an army of the Caliphate of C√≥rdoba in 1003 at Tor√†, Lleida. The main source for the battle is Andrew of Fleury, who probably received his information, which is detailed and generally accurate, during a trip to the Catalonia. He incorporated the account in his Miracula sancti Benedicti around 1043.Carl Erdmann (1977), The Origin of the Idea of Crusade, trans. by Marshall W. Baldwin and Walter Goffart (Princeton: Princeton University Press), 99-100. The four Christian counts of the battle were Raymond Borell of Barcelona, Bernard I of Besal√∫, Wifred II of Cerdagne, and Ermengol I of Urgell. The German historian of the Crusades Carl Erdmann supposed the leader of the Muslim army to be Abd al-Malik, the son of the recently deceased hajib Almanzor. When Andrew records that the caliph himself, then Hisham II, died in the encounter, he is probably rehearsing a local legend. The battle is not dated precisely by any chronicler, but the names of the counts (all given by Andrew) restrict it to between the years 992 and 1010. A date of 1003 has been deduced by Erdmann from other accounts that a Muslim army moved through the County of Barcelona and passed into the south of the County of Urgell in the summer of 1003. The exact location of the battle, Thoranum castrum (the castle, or fortified place, of Tor√†), is given by Andrew. The Muslims, according to both Latin and Arabic sources, were defeated and one of their leading men killed. The Muslims retreated to their own territory, where a second battle was fought at Albesa.This‚ÄîErdmann's chronology‚Äîassumes a summertime campaign, whereas the battle of Albesa may have occurred in February and been the cause and not the effect of a Muslim invasion, cf. Dolors Bramon Planas (1995), \\"La batalla de Albesa (25 de febrero de 1003) y la primera aceifa de ‚Äò√Åbd al-Mallk al-Muzaifar (verano del mismo a√±o),\\" Anaquel de estudios √°rabes, 6, 21‚Äì28. The result of this second battle is unclear, but it was the end of the brief war, and possibly the campaigning season. Importantly, Andrew reports the battle in terms as if describing a holy war. The Muslims, whose numbers he puts at 17,000, are \\"new Philistines\\". Bernard of Besal√∫ he quotes as reasoning that if the saints Peter and Michael and the Virgin Mary each kill 5,000 Muslims, there will be a manageable number left for the soldiers. Bernard recalls that the Muslims are often slain before they have a chance to retreat. According to Andrew, after the battle the Virgin Mary miraculously brought news of the Christian victory to as far away as Monte Sant'Angelo. Despite the theme of religious warfare, Spanish historians have not picked up on Andrew's account. ==Notes== Category:Battles in Catalonia Category:Conflicts in 1003 Category:1003 in Europe Tora Category:11th century in Al-Andalus Category:Medieval Catalonia Category:Battles of the Reconquista ","title":"Battle of Tor√†"},{"id":"20205344","text":"Santa Barbara Starcraft Marine, Starcraft Boats, or simply Starcraft is the name of a company that manufactures boats, campers and RVs. In the beginning, Starcraft also produced farm equipment including aluminum water tanks. The original name of the company was Star Tank Company. ==History== Starcraft was founded in 1903 by Arthur E. Schrock in the rural town of Goshen, Indiana. In 1969, Bangor Punta purchased Starcraft and it grew to over 700 employees. Bangor Punta would become the first of five parties to own Starcraft. In 1980, they moved from Goshen to Topeka, Indiana. In the late 80s, Starcraft became part of the Brunswick family of companies, which included Mercury Marine. In 1996 Brunswick Corporation decided to divest itself of Starcraft. Doug Schrock, the son of Harold Schrock who had sold Starcraft, purchased Starcraft Boats. Starcraft's recreational vehicle business was sold to Jayco in the 1990s. Starcraft Marine is now part of the Smoker Craft family of boats based in New Paris, Indiana. ==Aluminum boat models== *Holiday- a closed-bow runabout ranging in size from 14' up to 22' in length *SuperSport- an open-bow versatile hull often used for fishing, cruising, or water sports *Jupiter- a closed-bow hull commonly built in a 16' length *Jet/JetStar- closed-bow light runabouts often used for water sports *Islander- 18'-26' cuddy cabin cruisers often used for deep-water fishing/cruising *Chieftain- Starcraft's original aluminum cuddy cabin model made in lengths from 18'-24'holiiday *Sunchief- the largest closed-bow model runabout available with inboard-outboard power *Marlin - 14 and 16 ft closed bow, tiller steering, wood bench seats. last produced in 1966 *Sea Scamp- 12'-14' fishing hulls with bench-style seating *Seafarer- Similar to the Sea Scamp only more lightweight *Offshore V- A rare model of the SuperSport designed for open water fishingj ==Fiberglass boat models== Older (1960s-1970s) Starcraft fiberglass boats were characterized by their simulated \\"wood-strake\\" side hull appearance (excepting the Safari model), one-piece curved windscreens, smooth fiberglass closed-bow tops, 4 place fold-down seating, and having a modest outboard engine capacity ranging from 45 hp up to around 75 hp/80 hp (excepting Newport & Imperial I/O models). Lighter, more powerful, modern outboards can be accommodated on these study & well made hull transoms but torque forces developed by newer outboards do present some risk of damage to structural integrity if they exceed the rated capacity. Model names appear to have changed often in the 1960s, with different trim packages being the only true distinction between similarly sized models and engine capacities. In the mid-1970s tri-hulled style models were offered and the traditional closed-bow models began using sleeker, smooth, modern side-hull appearance designs, losing their distinctive classic \\"faux wood-strake\\" appearance. By the 1980s deep-V hull, deck boat, and both cuddy & bowrider sportfisher/sport runabout models expanded Starcraft's pleasure and fishing boat offerings as Brunswick acquired the marine division & brought Starcraft into the modern fiberglass boat design mainstream. ==1960s-early 1970s== *Arrow- 14' fiberglass model rated for up to 45 hp outboard engines (circa 1968). *Mustang- Similar in size (14') and capacity (</=45&nbsp;hp) to the Arrow (circa 1966). *Siren- 14' model similar to the Arrow & Mustang (circa 1965). *Bahama- 15' fiberglass closed-bow runabout/fishing model rated for up to 75&nbsp;hp outboard engines (circa 1964). *Lancer- 15' fiberglass model similar to the Bahama & Saber models (circa 1962). *Saber- Similar in size (15') and capacity (</=75 hp) to the Bahama & Lancer models (circa 1963-1968). *Caravelle- 15' fiberglass model rated for up to 80 hp outboard engines (circa 1968). *Riviera- 17' closed-bow \\"wood-straked\\" appearance fiberglass offering from Starcraft (circa 1965). ‚Ä¢ *American- 15' fiberglass Starcraft model differing in appearance with its more modern \\"smooth\\" rather than \\"wood-straked\\" hull sides look (circa 1973). *Safari- 16' fiberglass Starcraft model differing in appearance with its more modern \\"smooth\\" rather than \\"wood-straked\\" hull sides look (circa 1966). ‚Ä¢ *Newport- 16' fiberglass ski boat model equipped with 120 hp Mercruiser I/O stern drive (circa 1968). *Imperial- 18' fiberglass model equipped with 250c.i./165 hp Mercruiser I/O stern drive (circa 1968). ‚Ä¢ *Tri Star- 17' fiberglass tri-hull style model carrying the more modern appearance & appointments of present-day glass boats (circa 1978). ==References== * Company history and overview ==External links== * Official website Category:American boat builders Category:American companies established in 1903 Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1903 ","title":"Starcraft Marine"},{"id":"20205350","text":"Smelling is an important part of wine tasting; it is thought that much of perceived taste is due to olfactory receptors at the back of the nasal cavity. The aromas of wine are more diverse than its flavors. The human tongue is limited to the primary tastes perceived by taste receptors on the tongue ‚Äì sourness, bitterness, saltiness, sweetness and savoriness. The wide array of fruit, earthy, leathery, floral, herbal, mineral, and woodsy flavor present in wine are derived from aroma notes sensed by the olfactory bulb.J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition p. 683 Oxford University Press 2006 In wine tasting, wine is sometimes smelled before being drunk in order to identify some components of the wine that may be present. Different terms are used to describe what is being smelled. The most basic term is aroma which generally refers to a \\"pleasant\\" smell as opposed to odor which refers to an unpleasant smell or possible wine fault. The term aroma may be further distinguished from bouquet which generally refers to the smells that arise from the chemical reactions of fermentation and aging of the wine.J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition p. 35 Oxford University Press 2006 == Aroma vs. bouquet == A common aroma associated with the grape variety Gew√ºrztraminer is that of lychee fruit. In professional wine tasting, there is generally a distinction made between \\"aromas\\" and a wine's \\"bouquet\\" while in casual wine tasting these two terms are used interchangeably. An aroma refers to the smells unique to the grape variety and are most readily demonstrated in a varietal wine ‚Äì such as lychees with Gew√ºrztraminer or black currant with Cabernet Sauvignon. These are smells that are commonly associated with a young wine. As a wine ages, chemical reactions among acids, sugars, alcohols and phenolic compounds create new smells that are known as a wine's bouquet. These can include honey in an aged Sauternes or truffles in a Pinot noir. The term bouquet can also be expanded to include the smells derived from fermentation and exposure to oak. In Burgundy, the aromas of wines are sub- divided into three categories ‚Äì primary, secondary and tertiary aromas. Primary aromas are those specific to the grape variety itself. Secondary aromas are those derived from fermentation. Tertiary aromas are those that develop through either bottle or oak aging. The technique of microoxygenation affects the aromatic bouquet.Sensory characteristics changes of red Grenache wines submitted to different oxygen exposures pre and post bottling. Soline Caill√©, Alain Samson, J√©r√©mie Wirth, Jean-Baptiste Di√©val, St√©phane Vidal and V√©ronique Cheynier, Analytica Chimica Acta, 15 February 2010, Volume 660, Issues 1‚Äì2, pp. 35‚Äì42, == Components of a wine's aroma == Within wine there are volatile and non-volatile compounds that contribute to the make up of a wine's aroma. During the fermentation and for the first few months of a wine's existence, chemical reactions among these compounds occur frequently and a wine's aroma will change more rapidly during this period than at any other point. As a wine ages and matures, changes and developments in aroma will continue to take place but at a slower and more gradual pace. Volatile aroma compounds are present in the skin and juice of a grape berry and will vary in composition according to the individual grape variety. It is theorized that the Vitis vine developed these compounds as an evolutionary tool to aid in procreation by attracting insects to assist with pollination and birds and other animals to eat the berries and disperse the seeds. The diverse spectrum of aromas associated with individual grape varieties is a reflection of the vine's adaptation to ecological conditions and competition among other plants.J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pp. 273‚Äì274 Oxford University Press 2006 It is theorized that the grapevine developed aroma compounds as an evolutionary advancement to attract insects and animals to assist in pollination and dispersion of seeds. The majority of volatile compounds responsible for aroma combine with sugars in the wine to form odorless glycosides. Through the process of hydrolysis, caused by enzymes or acids in the wine, they revert into an aromatic form. The act of tasting wine is essentially the act of smelling these vaporized aroma compounds. Olfactory receptors cells, each sensitive to a different aroma, pick up these compounds and transfer the information to the brain by way of the olfactory bulb.K. MacNeil The Wine Bible pp. 100‚Äì104 Workman Publishing 2001 In the 1980s there was renewed focus in studying the correlation between aroma/flavor compounds in grapes and the resulting quality of wine. Scientists were able to use chromatograph ‚Äì mass spectrometers to identify volatile aroma compounds in various grape varieties. Study of the compounds responsible for aroma and flavor, as well as their correlation with a wine's quality, is ongoing. As understanding of these compounds grows, there is concern that wines in the future could be \\"manipulated\\" through the use of chemical additives to add complexity and additional aromas to wine (such as creating a manufactured perfume) . In 2004, a winery in South Africa was found to have added illegal flavoring to their Sauvignon blanc to enhance the aroma. Viticultural studies have focused on how aroma compounds develop in the grapes during the annual growth cycle of the vine and how viticultural techniques such as canopy management may contribute to developing desirable aromatics in the wine. === Identified aroma compounds === Some of the identified aroma compounds include the following: * Methoxypyrazine ‚Äì grassy, herbaceous aroma compound associated with Cabernet Sauvignon and Sauvignon blanc. * Monoterpenes ‚Äì responsible for the floral aromatics of varieties like Gew√ºrztraminer, Muscat and Riesling. Includes geraniol, linalool and nerol. * Norisoprenoids ‚Äì Carotenoid derived aromatic compoundsCarotenoid breakdown products the ‚Äì norisoprenoids ‚Äì in wine aroma. Maria Manuela Mendes-Pinto, Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics, 15 March 2009, Volume 483, Issue 2, pp. 236‚Äì245, that includes megastigmatrienone which produces some of the spice notes associated with Chardonnay and zingerone responsible for the different spice notes associated with Syrah. Other norisoprenoids include raspberry ketone which produces some of the raspberry aromas associated with red wine, damascenone which produces some of the rose oil aromas associated with Pinot noir, and vanillin. * Thiols/Mercaptans ‚Äì sulfur-containing compounds that can produce an aroma of garlic and onion that is considered a wine fault. They have also been found to contribute to some of the varietal aromas associated with Cabernet Sauvignon, Gew√ºrztraminer, Merlot, Muscat, Petit Manseng, Pinot blanc, Pinot gris, Riesling, Scheurebe, Semillon and Sylvaner. ===Esters=== Some of the aromas perceived in wine are from esters created by the reaction of acids and alcohol in the wine. Esters can develop during fermentation, with the influence of yeast, or later during aging by chemical reactions. The precise yeast strain used during fermentation and temperature are two of the strongest indicators of what kind of esters will develop and helps explain partially why Chardonnay grown in the same vineyard but made by two different producers could have different aromatics. During bottle aging hydrogen ions, found in higher concentration in low pH (high acid) wines, serves as a catalyst in the formation of esters from acids and alcohols present in the wine. However, at the same time these hydrogen ions encourage esters to also split apart back into acids and alcohols. These two counterbalancing acts gradually inch a wine closer to a state of equilibrium where there is equal parts alcohol, acids, esters and water (a by product of the reactions). During this period the ester influenced bouquet of the wine is constantly changing due to the concentration, formulation and splitting of different esters. This is partly the reason why a wine will have one set of aromas at one time and other aromas later in its life.J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition p. 258 Oxford University Press 2006 ==In wine tasting== The sense of smell and detecting the aromas in wine is the primary means through which wine is tasted and evaluated. Prior to tasting the wine, wine drinkers will often smell the wine in the glass.T. Stevenson \\"The Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia\\" p. 10 Dorling Kindersley 2005 Large bowl glasses with tapered openings, some of which are specifically designed to enhance aromatics of different wines, can assist in capturing more aromatics within the glass for the drinker to detect. Wines served at warmer temperature will be more aromatic than wine served cooler due to heat's ability to increase the volatility of aromatic compounds in the wine. Swirling, or aerating, the wine will increase available surface area, increasing the rate at which aroma molecules volatilize. Some subtle aromatics can be overwhelmed by more dominant aromatics that arise after swirling, so most professional tasters will sniff the wine briefly first before swirling. The closer the nose is to the wine, even right inside the glass, the greater chances of aromatics being captured. A series of short, quick sniffs versus one long inhale will also maximize the likelihood of aromatics being detected. The human nose starts to \\"fatigue\\" after around six seconds and so a pause may be needed between sniffs. When wine is sipped, it is warmed in the mouth and mixes with saliva to vaporize the volatile aroma compounds. These compounds are then inhaled \\"retro-nasally\\" through the back of the mouth to where it is received by nearly five million nerve cells. The average human can be trained to distinguish thousands of smells but can usually only name a handful at a time when presented with many aromas. This phenomenon, known as the \\"tip of the nose phenomenon\\", is countered when a person is given a list of possible choices, through which they can often positively identify the aroma. Professional wine tasters will often mentally cycle through a list of potential aromas (and may use visual aids like the aroma wheel, developed by Ann C. Noble of University of California, Davis) until one choice stands out and can be identified in the wine. Detecting an aroma is only part of wine tasting. The next step is to describe or communicate what that aroma is and it is in this step that the subjective nature of wine tasting appears. Different individuals have their own way of describing familiar scents and aromas based on their unique experiences. Furthermore, there are varying levels of sensitivity and recognition thresholds among humans of some aromatic compounds. This is why one taster may describe different aromas and flavors from another taster sampling the very same wine. ==See also== * Speyer wine bottle ==References== Category:Wine Category:Wine tasting ","title":"Aroma of wine"},{"id":"20205365","text":"Wapasha (IV) (1854‚Äì1925) was a Mdewakanton Dakota chief, also known as \\"Hdakinyan\\" and Napoleon Wapasha.

The Texas Book Festival is a free annual book fair held in Austin, Texas. The festival was established in 1995 by Laura Bush, then the First Lady of Texas, and Mary Margaret Farabee, wife of former State Senator Ray Farabee. The first festival took place at the Texas State Capitol in November 1996. The festival takes place in late October or early November. It is frequently cited as one of the top book festivals in the United States. The festival was initially created to benefit the state's public library system, promotes the joy of reading, and honor Texas authors. Since then, the festival has greatly expanded, with a focus on nationally known authors, attracting major bestsellers and award- winners. The revised mission statement: \\"The Texas Book Festival connects authors and readers through experiences that celebrate the culture of literacy, ideas, and imagination. With the assistance of Honorary Chairman and librarian, Mrs. Bush, and a task force, the festival has grown, hosting more than 2,000 authors since its introduction. It grew to hosting about 250 authors each year and attracting more than 40,000 attendees. In 2015, it hit a record 300 authors, including Booker Prize winner Margaret Atwood, Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Elizabeth Strout, Pulitzer Prize-winning critic Margo Jefferson, politicians Gary Hart and John Sununu, Jonathan Lethem, Lemony Snicket, Taye Diggs, Leonard Pitts, Robert Christgau and Jessica Hopper. Each year, the festival honors a writer with the \\"Bookend Award\\" for outstanding contribution to the literature of Texas. In addition to the award event, the festival includes children's books, crafts, and costumed characters. 2020 will see the entire festival to be held online, caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. ==See also== * Books in the United States * National Book Festival, founded by Laura Bush and James H.

The project was created and is led by Mahabir Pun, who received international recognition including the Magsaysay Award for his work in this field. == Development of the wireless network infrastructure == Himanchal High School, founded in 1993, is located in Nangi, a mountain village in western Nepal. In 1996, Mahabir Pun started using the school's Web site to attract volunteers and collect materials for the school. After requesting assistance from the BBC, Pun attracted volunteers and computer equipment donations from around the world. Pun used two small hydro-generators installed in nearby streams to power computers which had been donated by people in Australia, Singapore and Malaysia. In 2002, Wi-Fi-based wireless connectivity was established between Nangi and a neighbouring village, Ramche. After five years, the team succeeded in connecting Nangi to Pokhara, the closest city with Internet access. Numerous institutions and technology firms provided support for the project, including the Donald Strauss Foundation, the International Center for Applied Studies in Information Technology at George Mason University, the World Bank, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), Doodle Labs, Pacific Wireless and others. Besides the international support, local institutions including the E-Networking Research and Development, Gandaki College of Engineering and Sciences and Prime College also contributed to the project. By 2008, forty-two villages in Myagdi, Kaski, Parbat, Makawanpur, Dolakha, Palpa, Bajhang and Khumbu region had acquired Internet access through the project. At that time, nineteen further villages in Rasuwa, Nuwakot, Gorakha, Tanahu, Myagdi and Baglung districts were also anticipating Internet access. Nepal Wireless serviced more than 140 remote mountain villages. ===Communications=== Using Wi-Fi technology, many villages within the project region have been connected to the Public-switched Telephone Network (PSTN). Previously, most of them did not have telephone access. The communications centers in these villages now provide call services, Internet access, and video conferencing facilities. These centers are also capable of providing photocopying, document processing and photography services. ===Distance Education=== High school students began using the Internet for educational purposes, and using e-mail to communicate with fellow students abroad. The project worked with the Open Learning Exchange, Nepal Research and Education Network , a non-governmental organization, to develop interactive educational materials based on government curricula. While live distance education programs have been tested, due to poor video quality, the project is seeking technical assistance to make the system functional. This is required to address the problem of providing education and training in remote areas of Nepal. ===Telemedicine=== Three villages, Nangi, Ramche and Tikot, are connected to the city hospital in Pokhara. In order to treat patients, health workers in these villages use video-conferencing facilities to share information with the doctors in the city hospital. The project also helped to launch a telemedicine service between Kathmandu Model Hospital and Dolakha General Hospital, and plans to expand services in the rural areas of Makawanpur. ===E-Commerce=== In 2007, with the help of student volunteers of Gandaki College of Engineering and Sciences of Pokhara, the project launched a Web site for local electronic commerce. This Web site is used to trade supplies such as grain, poultry, and cattle. Virtual credit card transaction was also being tested in 2008. ===Agricultural=== Farmers have been using the network to buy and sell livestock as well as exchange veterinary tips. The web-based agriculture application called Haatbazar (local market) has facilitated increasingly diverse agriculture applications, including yak raising, cheese making, yak and cow cross-breeding farms, fisheries and vegetable farming. ===Environmental=== Nepal Wireless is developing a surveillance system at Chitwan National Park to monitor poachers and to help save endangered species like tigers, leopards, and rhinos. Environmental applications have mostly been collaborations with larger projects, including setting up of weather stations at high altitude locations like Mohare Danda. ===Social enterprises=== The project also provides a plant nursery, a carpentry facility, paper-making and sewing machine workshops, a camping ground for trekkers, a fish farm and a yak farm to support the local economy and provide employment. == Future and long- term goals == The future and long-term goals of NWNP include: # acquiring additional resources to improve and extend distance education and telemedicine programs # running electronic commerce training programs in the villages # improving the quality of Internet connectivity # extending the existing network and services # starting remittance and credit card transactions in the villages and tourist towns # organizing training programs to help others replicate the network in other parts of the country # developing a formal Web application dedicated to telemedicine # adding redundancy and backup to existing network services # developing a limited liability company with multiple stakeholders. ==References External links == * Nepal Wireless Networking Project * Himanchal Education Foundation *Mahabir's center for nepal connection Category:Internet in Nepal Category:Communications in Nepal Category:Wireless network organizations Category:Community networks ","title":"Nepal Wireless Networking Project"},{"id":"20205531","text":"Principal Chiefs of the Arapaho Tribe, engraving by James D.

Cheyenne and Arapaho Indian Reservation were the lands granted the Southern Cheyenne and the Southern Arapaho by the United States under the Medicine Lodge Treaty signed in 1867. The tribes never lived on the land described in the treaty and did not want to. Recognizing this fact, on August 10, 1869 President Grant issued an executive order to set aside lands on the North Fork of the Canadian River for the tribes.\\"Cheyenne and Arapaho Reserve\\" Oklahoma History Center. The lands were located in western Indian Territory south of the Cherokee Outlet and north of the Kiowa-Comanche-Apache Indian Reservation.Berthrong, map, pp. 13-14 However, a portion of it was split off later to form the Caddo-Wichita-Delaware Indian Reservation.Berthrong, p. viii The area occupied by the tribes is now referred to as the Cheyenne-Arapaho Oklahoma Tribal Statistical Area. ==The last of the buffalo== Following the Red River War, nearly all of the Southern Cheyenne and the Southern Arapaho began to live on the reservation. Despite the best efforts of the Indian Agent, John DeBras Miles, the promised government rations were inadequate and the tribes also suffered from disease. Congress appropriated inadequate funds for support of the reservations and only poor quality cattle were available for sale to the government. Thousands of cattle were being grazed illegally on the reservation by Texas cattlemen, but when the Indian agent attempted to buy cattle, he was refused. Some cattle were confiscated on promise of payment. On the advice of the army, fearful of an outbreak, Miles withheld ammunition from the tribes, leaving them as easy prey for white horse thieves. Cheyenne women gained some paying work tanning hides for white traders. In 1875, 1876, and 1877 the tribes competed with white buffalo hunters for the last of the diminishing buffalo herds. Many buffalo were taken, but never enough to satisfy the tribes' needs; by 1877 there were very few left. In the winter of 1877-78 the remaining stragglers of the southern herd were hunted down.Berthrong, pp. 3-18 ==Northern Cheyenne== In 1877 nearly a thousand Northern Cheyenne came or were escorted to the reservation from their home ranges in the north. Rations were inadequate, as was medical care. In September 1878, a band under the leadership of Dull Knife and Little Wolf escaped and fled north, the Northern Cheyenne Exodus. Most of the Northern Cheyenne remained, but by 1883 all that wanted to were permitted to return to the north where the Tongue River Indian Reservation was established in 1884.Berthrong, pp. 26-47 ==Agriculture, education, and work== In the late 1870s and the early 1880s there was some farming by both the Cheyenne and Arapaho, with the Arapaho being more committed and successful. Recurrent droughts resulted in crop failures. It took several years for the Indian agent and his farmers to understand basic techniques of dryland farming, such as conserving winter moisture. There was some work hauling supplies, making hay, and cutting wood. Gradually more children were enrolled in the Indian boarding schools on the reservation and at Carlisle Institute in Pennsylvania. A separate facility patronized by the Cheyenne was established in Caddo Springs. But, the Cheyenne and Arapaho could find little work, even for the Carlisle graduates who returned to the reservation. The Indian agent's promising attempt to build a cattle herd was ended when the Office of Indian Affairs commanded distribution of the herd, giving each Indian an average of three cattle, too few to do much with. Shortages of rations continued, with few resources available to the Indian agent to provide work opportunities for his charges.Berthrong, pp. 48-90, ==Grazing licenses, 1882 to 1885== During the early 1880s, the vast majority of the reservation was licensed for grazing to large cattle outfits in 8 large parcels, at the rate of 2 cents per acre, about a third of the fair market price. They were not leases, as a legal lease of reservation land was forbidden by law. John DeBras Miles, the Indian agent, called a council of chiefs and cattlemen on December 12, 1882 to consider grazing permits, and believed he had obtained the consent of the vast majority of the representatives of the tribes. There was still strong opposition, particularly among the Cheyenne camped at Cantonment. They killed some cattle for food and also as cultural resistance. The soldier societies began requiring the Cheyenne to participate in medicine ceremonies and punished Cheyenne who farmed or sent their children to school. Miles resigned on March 31, 1884. His replacement, D. B. Dyer, did not respect the Cheyenne and his relations with them were strained. His approach to disorder was to request troops, which were not provided. Escalating conflict continued between Indians and the cattlemen. In July 1885, by presidential order of Grover Cleveland, the cattlemen were ordered off the reservation, which was placed under military control. Dyer was replaced by an army officer, Captain Jesse M. Lee.Pages 91 to 117, Berthrong, The Cheyenne and Arapaho Ordeal. A map of the cattle leases is shown on page 97. ==Dawes Allotment Act== The lands granted by the Treaty of Medicine Lodge were extensive, setting aside a substantial portion of western Oklahoma for the exclusive use of the Cheyenne and Arapaho. > ...The United States now solemnly agrees that no persons except those herein > authorized so to do, and except such officers, agents, and employ√©s of the > Government as may be authorized to enter upon Indian reservations in > discharge of duties enjoined by law, shall ever be permitted to pass over, > settle upon, or reside in the territory described in this article....Article > 2, TREATY WITH THE CHEYENNE AND ARAPAHO, 1867 Oct. 28, 1867; 15 Stats., > 593.; Ratified July 25, 1868.; Proclaimed Aug. 19, 1868 In 1890, the United States, operating through the agency of the Cherokee Commission, acting under the provisions of the Dawes Act, broke the treaty. It allotted a 160-acre parcel to each household for subsistence farming. The remainder was classified as surplus and sold to settlers. At the time, the government believed that forced assimilation to the European-American farm model would help the Indian learn to fit into United States society, as would the associated extinguishment of tribal government and communal tribal interest in land.60th annual Report of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs to the Secretary of the Interior. Bureau of Indian Affairs. Pp. 3-10. The allotments were held in trust by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, which leased much of that land to settlers. This process took several years, but by 1910 nearly all the lands of the reservation were in the possession or control of settlers, leaving the Indians as a small minority of the population of the reservation and possessing only a small portion of their original lands. At noon April 19, 1892, the lands of the Cheyenne and Arapaho reservation were opened for settlement by homesteaders; the Indians retained located mostly along the North Fork of the Canadian River, the Canadian River, and the Washita River.Moore, pp. 280-284Berthrong, pp. 148-181,Page 341 to 345, Report of the Cheyenne and Arapaho Agency, October 1, 1891, 60th annual Report of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs to the Secretary of the Interior Bureau of Indian Affairs ==The Cheyenne== Cheyenne beaded knife sheath, Oklahoma History Center In Oklahoma, the Cheyenne live near Thomas, Clinton, and Weatherford, Custer County; Hammon (Red Moon), Roger Mills County; El Reno and Concho, Canadian County; Kingfisher, Kingfisher County, Watonga and Canton, Blaine County; Seiling, Dewey County.

The two tribes are referred to in Oklahoma as the Southern Cheyenne and the Southern Arapaho, a reference intended to distinguish them from their respective northern divisions on reservations in Montana (Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation) and Wyoming (Wind River), respectively. The southern bands were forced to move to the Indian Territory as a result of the Medicine Lodge Treaty of 1867,Indian Affairs: Laws and Treaties, Vol. II. Compiled and edited by Charles J. Kappler. Washington : Government Printing Office, 1904. which was signed by Chief Little Raven as leader of the Southern Arapaho.\\"Cheyenne- Arapaho Lands Genealogy.\\" RootsWeb. ==The Arapaho== Arapaho women's leggings and moccasins, 1910, Oklahoma History Center In Oklahoma, the Arapaho live mostly in rural areas near the towns of Canton, Greenfield and Geary in Blaine County, and at Colony in Washita County. The name Arapaho originates in the Pawnee term tirapihu (or larapihu), meaning, \\"He buys or trades\\", probably due to their being the dominant trading group in the Great Plains region. The Arapaho call themselves Inun-ina meaning \\"our people\\" or \\"people of our own kind.\\" The Arapaho are one of the westernmost tribes of the Algonquian language family. Members of the Northern Arapaho who live on the Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming call the Oklahoma group Nawathi'neha or \\"Southerners.\\" With the Organic Act of 1870, the Arapaho retained a nominal tribal government, and twelve chiefs were selected by a scout and retired Arapaho chief named Ute. The twelve chiefs were Jesse Rowlodge, David Meat, John Hoof, Dan Blackhorse, Ben Spotted Wolf, Bill Williams, Wilburn Tabor, John Sleeper, Annanita Washee, Scott Youngman, Saul Birdshead, and Theodore Haury. Two Cheyenne were elected by custom to serve as Arapaho chiefs, Ben Buffalo and Ralph Whitetail. == Notes References== *Berthrong, Donald J.

Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, 1997, p. 351 In his youth he was educated at Constantinople, but he travelled to the monasteries of Andros, where he could obtain rare manuscripts and was taught mathematics by an old monk. He originally taught privately in obscurity in Constantinople. The story goes that when one of his studentsAccording to the Pseudo-Symeon, this student was Bo√Øditzes, who betrayed Amorium to the caliph. was captured during the Byzantine-Arab Wars, the Caliph al-Mamun was so impressed by his knowledge of mathematics that he offered Leo great riches to come to Baghdad.According to Joseph Genesius and Theophanes Continuatus between 829 and 833; Symeon the Logothete makes the caliph al-Mutasim and puts the invitation after the Islamic conquest of Amorium in the fall of 838, cf. Leo took the letter from the caliph to the Byzantine emperor Theophilos, who, impressed by his international repute, conferred on him a school (ekpaideutƒìrion) in either the Magnaura or the church of the Forty Martyrs.Symeon says the Magnaura, Continuatus the Forty Martyrs (Treadgold, \\"Chronological Accuracy \\", 186). In the version of the story recorded by Theophanes Continuatus, the caliph, upon receiving Leo's letter of refusal, sent a letter requesting answers to some difficult questions of geometry and astrology, which Leo obliged. Al-Mamun then offered two thousands pounds of gold and a perpetual peace to Theophilos, if only he could borrow Leo's services briefly; the request was declined. The emperor then honoured Leo by having John the Grammarian consecrate him metropolitan of Thessalonica, which post he held from the spring of 840 to 843. There is a discrepancy in this account, however, in that the caliph died in 833. It has been suggested that either the connection between the caliph's final letter and Leo's appointment as metropolitan is in error, or the caliph in question was actually al- Mutasim. This latter option squares with the account of Symeon the Logothete, who makes Leo teach at the Magnaura from late 838 to early 840 and was paid handsomely.Treadgold, \\"Chronological Accuracy \\", 172. Leo, an iconoclast sometimes accused of paganism, lost his metropolitancy with the end of the Iconoclasm in 843.Warren T. Treadgold (1997), A history of the Byzantine state and society (Stanford University Press), 447. Despite this, he delivered a sermon favourable of icons within months of Theophilos' death.Warren T. Treadgold (1988), The Byzantine Revival, 780-842 (Stanford University Press), 372. Around 855, Leo was appointed at the head of a newly established Magnaura School by Bardas.Treadgold, \\"Chronological Accuracy \\", 187, believes, on the basis of the Logothete's account, that this occurred in 843 and was a re- founding of Theophilos' school. He was renowned for his philosophical, mathematical, medical, scientific, literary, philological, astronomic, and astrological learning, and was patronised by Theoktistos and befriended by Photios I of Constantinople. Cyril was his student. Leo has been credited with a system of beacons (an optical telegraph) stretching across Asia Minor from Cilicia to Constantinople, which gave advance warning of Arab raids, as well as diplomatic communication. Leo also invented several automata, such as trees with moving birds, roaring lions, and a levitating imperial throne. The throne was in operation a century later, when Liutprand of Cremona witnessed it during his visit to Constantinople. Records Liutprand's description.For a detailed discussion of Leo's telegraph and his automata, see Leone Montagnini (2002), \\"Leone il Matematico, un anello mancante nella storia della scienza\\", Studi sull'Oriente Cristiano, 6 (2), 89‚Äì108. == Works == Most of Leo's writings have been lost. He wrote book-length works, poems, and many epigrams,Among them, worthy of special mention are some centos preserved in the Palatine Anthology, see Prieto Dom√≠nguez, √ìscar (2011), De Alieno Nostrum: el Cent√≥n profano en el mundo griego. Estudios filol√≥gicos, 328. Salamanca: Ediciones Universidad de Salamanca. , p. 120-179. and was also a compiler, who brought together a wide range of philosophical, medical, and astronomic texts. His library can at least partially be reconstructed: Archimedes, Euclid, Plato, Paul of Alexandria, Theon of Alexandria, Proclus, Porphyry, Apollonius of Perga, the lost Mechanics of Quirinus and Marcellus, and possibly Thucydides. He composed his own medical encyclopaedia. Later Byzantine scholars sometimes confused Leo with the scholar Leo Choirosphaktes and the emperor Leo VI the Wise, and ascribe to him oracles. ==Notes External links == *Katerina Ierodiakonou and B√∂rje Byd√©n (2008), \\"Byzantine Philosophy.\\" Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.

It was characterised by a Christian world-view, but one which could draw ideas directly from the Greek texts of Plato, Aristotle, and the Neoplatonists. ==History== Greek science and literature remained alive in the Byzantine world, and Byzantine philosophy drew heavily on Plato, Aristotle, and the Neoplatonists, even if it was now Christian in tone. In the 7th century, John of Damascus produced a three-part encyclopedia containing in its third part a systematic exposition of Christian theology.Ninian Smart, World Philosophies, pages 151-2. Routledge In the 9th century Photios, the Patriarch of Constantinople, collected many works by ancient writers, and studied Aristotelian logic, and his pupil Arethas commentated on works by Plato and Aristotle.Phil Linos Benakis, \\"Byzantine philosophy\\" entry in the Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy (1998) By the 11th and 12th centuries there was a growing interest in the teaching of philosophy, and figures such as Michael Psellos, Eustratius of Nicaea, and Michael of Ephesus wrote commentaries on Aristotle. In the 13th and 14th centuries we have important philosophers such as Nicephorus Blemmydes and Theodore Metochites. An important figure was Gregory Palamas who developed a mystical movement known as Hesychasm, which involved the use of the noetic Jesus prayer to achieve a vision of the uncreated Light also called the Illumination or Vision of God. It was the Hesychast movement that caused a rift in the Christian East which led many philosophically minded individuals to go West. This migration played a critical role in the manifestation of the Renaissance in the West. Especially the role Barlaam of Calabria, who opposed Hesychasm, played in the formation of Roman Catholic theology in the West. The last great philosopher of Byzantium was Gemistus Pletho who felt that a restored Platonism could reverse the decline of the Empire. He was an important figure in the transmission of ancient philosophy to the West. ==University of Constantinople== Byzantine society was well educated by the standards of its time, with high levels of literacy compared to the rest of the world. Significantly it possessed a secular education system that was a continuation of the academies of classical antiquity. Primary education was widely available, even at the village level. Uniquely in that society education was available for both sexes. It was in this context that the secular University of Constantinople can be understood. Further still secular education was common, to a degree, in the empire. As for many centuries, before the Muslim conquest, similar institutions operated in such major provincial capitals as Antioch and Alexandria.Europe: A Cultural History, by Peter Rietbergen 1998, p.101 The original school was founded in 425 by Emperor Theodosius II with 31 chairs for Law, Philosophy, Medicine, Arithmetic, Geometry, Astronomy, Music, Rhetoric and other subjects, 15 to Latin and 16 to Greek. The university existed until the 15th century.Myriobiblos The main content of higher education for most students was rhetoric, philosophy and law. With the aim of producing competent, and learned personnel to staff the bureaucratic postings of state and church. In this sense the University was the secular equivalent of the Theological Schools. The university maintained an active philosophical tradition based on Platonism and Aristotelianism, with the former being the longest unbroken Platonic school, running for close to two millennia until the 15th century. The School of Magnaura was founded in the 9th century and in the 11th new schools of philosophy and law were established at the Capitol School. The period of decline begun with the Latin conquest of 1204 although the University survived as a non-secular institution under Church management until the Fall of Constantinople. ==Issues and ideas== The principal characteristics of Byzantine philosophy are: #The personal hypostases of God as the principle not only of substance but also of being (Ontology, Metaphysics). Person as ontological rather than substance or essence. #The creation of the world by God and the limited timescale of the universe #The continuous process of creation and the purpose behind it #The perceptible world as the realization in time of that which is perceptible to the mind, having its eternal hypostasis in the divine intellect (nous) The world and humanity are subject to divine providence, but the Byzantine philosophers asserted the need for free-will and self-determination. The soul as immortal is uncreated in its energies but created in itself. Soul is body plus spirit, and directly connects with the intellect to enable the achievement of happiness by means of the freedom of decision. The relationship between God and human beings is based on love, which explains the central place of humans in creation. ===Neoplatonism=== The relationship between the mystic, religious understanding of God and a philosophical one has various stages of development in the history of the Roman East. The nous as mind in Byzantine philosophy is given the central role of understanding only when it is placed or reconciled with the heart or soul of the person. The soul being the whole unit of man the mind as rational and noetic being an integral part of man's soul. Earlier versions of Christian and Greek philosophical syncretism are in modern times referred to as Neoplatonic. An example of this can be seen in the works of Origen and his teaching on the nous as to Origen, all souls pre-existed with their Creator in a perfect, spiritual (non-material) state as \\"minds\\" or nous, but later fell away in order to pursue an existence independent of God. Since all souls were created absolutely free, God could not simply force them to return to Him (this was, according to Origen, due to God's boundless love and respect for His creatures). Instead, God created the material cosmos, and initiated history, for the purpose of guiding the wayward souls back to contemplation of His infinite mind, which is, according to Origen, the perfect state.Apokatastasis - In pre-Christian Stoic and Middle Platonic philosophy, this term referred to the universal restoration of the cosmos to the state in which it was first constituted by the divine mind or first principle. The great Christian theologian Origen of Alexandria used this term to denote the final restoration of all souls to God. According to Origen, all souls pre- existed with their Creator in a perfect, spiritual (non-material) state as \\"minds,\\" but later fell away in order to pursue an existence independent of God. Since all souls were created absolutely free, God could not simply force them to return to Him (this was, according to Origen, due to God's boundless love and respect for His creatures). Instead, God created the material cosmos, and initiated history, for the purpose of guiding the wayward souls back to contemplation of His infinite mind, which is, according to Origen, the perfect state. This obviously excludes any concept of eternal damnation or hell. ==See also== * Byzantine literature *Byzantine science *Halki seminary *Corpus Scriptorum Historiae Byzantinae *Greek scholars in the Renaissance *Medieval Greek ==NotesReferences== * Tatakis, B., 1949, La philosophie Byzantine, Paris.

Kurt Vonnegut called it, \\"A handbook for tough, truth-telling outsiders who are proud, as was Algren, to damn well stay that way.\\" ==Overview== The bulk, written between 1951 and 1953, presents Algren's philosophy as a writer, especially in the context of McCarthyism. The book was demanded by and given in June 1953 to his then-publisher Doubleday, but possibly due to the pressure of the FBI's then-ongoing investigation of Algren, Doubleday rejected it in September. Algren then sent it to his agent, but the manuscript was either lost in the mail or intercepted by the FBI, and the text salvaged from a carbon copy. In 1956, Algren gave those carbons to Van Allen Bradley, the Chicago Daily News editor who had commissioned the essay that inspired the book. Excerpts were published as \\"Things of the Earth: A Groundhog View\\" (in The California Quarterly, Autumn 1952) and as \\"Great Writing Bogged Down in Fear, Says Novelist Algren\\" (in the Chicago Daily News, December 3, 1952).

Philadelphia: Gresham Publishing, 1892. ==Judge James Van Horn== Judge James Van Horn was born in the state of New Jersey. James Van Horn moved north as the famous Erie Canal was being built. Van Horn settled in Newfane in 1817 with 9 children.\\"Town of Newfane Historical Society To Conduct Open House at Green Acres.\\" Lockport Union-Sun and Journal, 1978. Van Horn built a gristmill and was the first builder of a wool mill in Niagara County, New York in 1842.Niagara County Bicentennial. Niagara County, 2008. Van Horn became one of four of Niagara County's first judge's in 1821. In 1823, he built the brick Georgian-style Van Horn Mansion which was the first brick home in Newfane.\\"Van Horn Mansion Was First brick Home.\\" Lockport-Union Sun and Journal, 1990. James Van Horn was the Town of Newfane Supervisor from 1829-1831. Note: This includes and Accompanying nine photographs ==The Mansion after the Van Horns== The last surviving Van Horn descent sold the mansion to W.H. Davis of New York City in 1910. In 1922, it was owned by Herbert Pease. Douglas Patterson of Nova Scotia, Canada, purchased the mansion in 1929 after a short ownership by the Cramer Brothers. During that time until 1938, Patterson opened a community skating rink to the residents of Newfane. In 1939, the structure suffered a fire. Mary Wagner in 1949 received the mansion and helped to renovate it for an upscale restaurant known as Green Acres.Kostoff, Robert. The History of Niagara County, NY. Lewiston: Edwin Mellen Press, 2001. In 1959, the building was converted into apartments by John Strickland and eventually was left for vandals. The Noury Chemical Company acquired the structure and then donated it to the Newfane Historical Society in 1987. The Newfane Historical Society has maintained its splendor and value to present day. It has held Victorian teas, tours, and underwent numerous volunteer renovation programs over the years. ==Haunting Occurrences== Malida Van Horn's grave stone located on the grounds of the Van Horn. In 1996, a student of Niagara County Community College created a haunted house in the mansion. Psychics have long called the building haunted. The Van Horn Mansion is one of several haunted locations in Niagara County and Western New York. During renovations roofers witnessed faces in windows of the vacant mansion and saw lights flicker for no reason. Carpenters saw spirits appear to them. The person who haunts the mansion is said to be Malinda with a few others. The grave of Malinda, wife of James Van Horn Jr, is located in the rose garden on the south side of the grounds. Cars have skidded to avoid hitting a girl running from the mansion who later vanishes.Winfield, Mason. Buffalo: Petit Press, 2003. The girl is believed to be Malinda. People have held s√©ances there, and have recounted other paranormal occurrences as well. The bones of Malinda have since been moved to a small area in the backyard of the mansion and no other paranormal encounters have been made. Researcher Joe Nickell has written that there is no credible evidence the mansion is haunted. He wrote that the various incidents at the mansion have simple physical causes or are the result of misperception and suggestion. Nickell discovered that there were many contradictory and exaggerated stories about Malinda. He also attended some s√©ances in 2003 and discovered the table-tipping phenomena was the result of the ideomotor effect.Nickell, Joe. (2012).

Begonia boliviensis is of special historical interest to gardeners, being one of the species used by John Seden in the production of the first hybrid tuberous begonia raised in England, B. √ó sedenii. The plant originates from montane cloud forests on the eastern side of the Andes in Bolivia and Argentina. It is typically found in rock crevices and slopes near streams, where plant competition is low. It was exhibited for the first time at the International Horticultural Show in Paris, in May 1867, when it attracted much attention from both botanists and horticulturists, \\"more than any other plant then brought to that magnificent exhibition.\\" ==Description== The stems of Begonia boliviensis spring from a tuberous root-stock, and attain a height of between and ; the flowers, produced in pairs or threes on short stems in the angles of the obliquely lanceolate leaves, are bright orange/pink in colour, composed of four pointed segments. The description in Hortus Veitchii reads: > \\"A very beautiful plant with drooping scarlet flowers, from Bolivia, sent by > Richard Pearce, and of great interest as one of the original species from > which the numerous garden varieties, so popular at the present day, have > been derived.\\" The cultivar B. boliviensis 'Bonfire' is widely available commercially and can be used in containers, in hanging baskets and as a landscape plant. It has bright-orange, bell-shaped flowers covering the plant from late spring through summer, with serrated foliage accented by a red margin. It reaches tall. ==Hybridization== Shortly after the plant's introduction to England, John Seden, the foreman at James Veitch & Sons of Chelsea, London, successfully crossed B. boliviensis and another Andean species, believed to be B. veitchii. This was the first hybrid tuberous begonia raised in England. The new hybrid variety was named B. √ó sedenii after him and was distributed in 1870, having been awarded the Silver Floral Medal by the Royal Horticultural Society.Irish Gardening (1909) Volume 4 page 98 ==References== boliviensis Category:Flora of Argentina Category:Flora of Bolivia Category:Garden plants Category:Veitch Nurseries Category:Plants described in 1859 ","title":"Begonia boliviensis"},{"id":"20205757","text":"Astragalus cimae is a species of milkvetch known by the common name Cima milkvetch.

It was released on May 19, 2009 in North America. The game ships with a strappable pouch to hold the Nunchuk and a resistance band. The game is the first in a line of EA Sports Active branded games and related peripherals. An expansion, EA Sports Active: More Workouts, was released on November 17, 2009. A follow-up, EA Sports Active 2, released in November 2010. An NFL-themed version, EA Sports Active NFL Training Camp, was released on the same day. == Gameplay == EA Sports Active is an exercise game consisting of activities that use the motion controls of the Wii platform. Primarily played using the Wii Remote, the game package includes a pouch that allows the player to strap the attached Nunchuk to their legs in order to track their lower body movements. The Wii Balance Board is also supported but is not required for play.Q&A;: EA Sports Active-ating Wii The game features a number of exercise options supervised by a virtual personal trainer, including 20 minute workout regimens and a 30 Day Challenge mode that lets players set workout goals, such as calories burned or a number of sessions while tracking their progress over time. The idea is that the weight loss will happen on its own if the calories burned goals in each workout are met or exceeded. The game also awards trophies for reaching specific fitness landmarks, such as accumulating 10 total workout hours, working out with a friend, and completing all the exercises in the 30 Day Challenge. Players are also encouraged to create a custom workout session built around either personal favorite exercises, calorie goals (such as burning 100+ calories in one session), or targeting specific body areas. To help aid in creating a balanced workout, a percentage chart displays how much of the routine is devoted to either upper body, lower body, or cardio development. The intensity of the workout can be altered by changing the difficulty levels of either a single exercise or the entire routine. == Development == EA Sports' Peter Moore claims that EA Sports Active was developed to focus more on a higher-impact \\"Western\\" philosophy of exercise focused mainly on weight loss, compared to a lower-impact, stretching and balance based \\"Eastern\\" approach, as taken by Nintendo's Wii Fit. EA also saw a strong business opportunity in creating a game for people who need to work out yet do not have the time or are not comfortable doing so in public.EA Sports Chief Names His Brand‚Äôs 2008 Highlight, Predicts Fitness Gaming Boom Celebrity personal trainer Bob Greene was involved with developing the game. ==Reception== EA Sports Active has received generally positive reviews from video game critics and the mainstream media. One of the biggest critiques on EA's community message boards about the game was the lack of real resistance offered by the supplied elastic band. Many found that folding the band over itself as suggested by the game's tutorial to be ineffective in increasing the resistance level. However, the supplied grips for the elastic band can be used with other elastic bands, specifically those used in pilates, in order to increase the intensity of all upper body exercises.EA Sports Active General Discussion - Elastic Band for muscle development EA claims that EA Sports Active has sold over 600,000 units worldwide between May 19, 2009 and June 1, 2009, and 1.8 million units in its quarter. It is EA's best selling Wii title. The lack of an option to switch to left-handed has caused discontent for some left-handed users who have purchased the game as this is not advertised on the outer packaging. ==More workouts== After the success the game received, EA Sports released an expansion pack on 17 November 2009, titled EA Sports Active: More Workouts, which, as the name suggests, added several new workouts to the existing program. == References  External links == * Official EA Sports Active website Category:2009 video games Category:EA Sports games Category:Electronic Arts franchises Category:Electronic Arts games Category:Exergames Category:Video games developed in Canada Category:Video games with expansion packs Category:Wii games Category:Wii-only games Category:Wii Balance Board games ","title":"EA Sports Active"},{"id":"20205816","text":"The Shri Ram School is a co-educational private school in India.

All campuses are polythene free zones and a fine of up to Rs. 50/- can be levied for the offense (by the Green Brigade). The Junior Schools are equipped with a 'Green Brigade' that emphasises saving the environment within the school and in the neighbourhood. The Senior Schools have a Tiger Task Force that visits nearby tiger reserves and helps in any way that they can towards the conservation of the tiger - India's national animal. == Motto == Vidya Dadaati Vinayam - May Education Foster Humility. Also the national anthem is widely sung at Shri Ram Awards The Shri Ram School was rated the best school in India in 2010 by the magazine \\"Education World\\" whereas in 2011 it came in second. == Curriculum == The school ascribes to the ISC and ICSE Boards. In addition, the IB Diploma Programme (since January 2005), administered by the International Baccalaureate (IB) The Shri Ram School IBO website. and the National Indian Open Schooling Certificate are offered at the Senior School in the Moulsari campus. == Campus facilities/infrastructure == The Junior School is at the edge of the Ridge Forest on a plot.

The grey-green stone fa√ßade of Senior School, set amidst of gently undulating green of the campus, is set against the desert landscape of Gurgaon. The building's design is based on 'clusters' of rooms for the Middle School, the Senior School and the Administrative offices. Ramps facilitate access for students and visitors. Interspersed in between are the Library, the computer laboratories, science laboratories, AV room, workshop room, the liberal arts studio, the auditorium, the gymnasium, the medical room, the SEN/NIOS rooms, the kitchens, the lunch area and staff rooms.

The building has two wings - the Junior and Senior, containing the library, science laboratories, Computer Laboratories, workshop room/AV room, SEN/NIOS rooms, art and craft rooms, music and dance studios, the lunch hall. A new wing for the Elementary School is under construction, designed for low consumption of energy - the rooms will not need to be lit during the days, they will be well ventilated and naturally insulated against the heat and cold, with solar panels on the roof and roof top rain water harvesting. There is a plan to add another building in the DLF campus. An extra floor is also being added to the older school buildings of the DLF campus. An extra floor has already been added to The Shri Ram School - Aravali and an auditorium has been constructed. == Developing a social conscience == Each campus provides opportunity to the less advantaged in the community. Vasant Vihar plays host to Vidya Bal Vihar, Aravali to Vidya Comfort School, and Moulsari to Balwadi providing a space for 'slum' children to get their education in a 'proper school'. The children of Class XI take part each year in Socially Useful Productive Work (SUPW) during which they spend a week in a village, experiencing every aspect of village life and contributing to it. Prior to the trip, the village is asked for a wish list and the children offer physical labour to fulfil that need. For example, the students have constructed a road, built a shed in the cremation ground and a completely cemented basketball court - acquiring the skills needed to do so. The students work with the villagers, visit their homes and share their food thus gaining a true understanding of the challenges and strengths of rural India. The children of the same group that have opted for the IBSCSYSE Diploma Programme take on a similar initiative - that of Community, action, service (CAS). In 2010, after the 2010 Leh floods, its students formed \\"Mission Julley\\", (Julley means 'hello' in the local language), an initiative which included an online community page and events, collected Rs 8 lakh for three schools and a Relief Camp in Leh. The entire parent and student body was involved in raising money. ==References * The Shri Ram School Official Website (http://tsrs.org/) Category:International Baccalaureate schools in India Category:Private schools in Delhi Category:Schools in Gurgaon Category:Schools in Noida Category:Educational institutions established in 1988 Category:1988 establishments in India ","title":"The Shri Ram School"},{"id":"20205850","text":"A map of Kamakura is the name of a neighborhood (a ) in Kamakura, a city located in Kanagawa, Japan, about 50 km south-south-west of Tokyo.

Eligibility rules for prospective players have changed several times during the history of the league. No player may sign with the NBA until they are 19 years or older. Players who have played at least one year of college basketball are eligible for the NBA draft; this has been colloquially called the one-and-done rule, with such players called \\"one-and-done players\\". ==Early history== In the earliest days of the NBA, three players entered the NBA without having played in college (although one of them did not enter the league until he was 39 years old). However, the league eventually established a rule that \\"a player could not make himself available\\" for the draft until two years after his high school graduation.One later player, Reggie Harding, would be drafted in 1962 despite never enrolling in a college an being less than four years out of high school. However, he did not enter the league until , after he had turned 21. ==Haywood v. NBA== The first major challenge to the NBA's eligibility rules came from Spencer Haywood. He graduated from high school in 1968, at a time when college freshmen were not allowed to play varsity sports for NCAA member schools. He played a year at a Colorado junior college, followed by a season at the University of Detroit. After the 1970‚Äì71 season, he left college for the NBA's rival at the time, the ABA, which had no rule restricting college underclassmen from entering the league, and had a spectacularly successful rookie season with the Denver Rockets (the predecessor to today's Denver Nuggets), being named the ABA's Rookie of the Year and MVP. Near the end of the season, he turned 21; shortly after its end, he repudiated his contract with the Rockets, claiming he had been defrauded. Haywood then signed a contract with the Seattle SuperSonics (later relocated to become the Oklahoma City Thunder), which put him and the Sonics on a collision course with the NBA, as he was only three years removed from his high school graduation. The NBA threatened to disallow the contract and impose sanctions against the Sonics. Haywood responded by filing an antitrust suit against the league, seeking an injunction to prevent the NBA from disallowing the contract or punishing the Sonics. The case eventually reached the U.S. Supreme Court, which issued a 7‚Äì2 decision in Haywood's favor in 1971. After the decision, the NBA allowed players to leave college early as \\"hardship cases\\", which essentially meant that the player had to prove financial hardship. This rule quickly developed into one that was observed in the breach, with Sport magazine writer Jackie Lapin commenting in the 1970s that \\"Almost anyone who has been any good at the game in the past decade would qualify [as a hardship case]‚Äîwith the probable exception of Bill Bradley, the banker's son.\\" ==Later history== As a consequence of the aforementioned Haywood decision, and following soon after, three high schoolers chose to enter the professional ranks without ever enrolling in a college. The first was Moses Malone, who went to the ABA upon his high school graduation in 1974, almost immediately establishing himself as a star of the future. After the ABA‚ÄìNBA merger in 1976, his career continued on its upward trajectory, ultimately earning him three NBA MVP awards, four appearances on the All-NBA First Team, 12 consecutive NBA All-Star Game appearances, an NBA title, a place among the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History, and enshrinement in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. In 1975, Darryl Dawkins and Bill Willoughby both went to the NBA from high school. Dawkins had a solid 14-year career in the NBA, while Willoughby was no more than a journeyman in eight NBA seasons. While underclass draftees are too numerous to list, it can be noted that among the aforementioned 50 Greatest Players, 10 (not including Malone) left college early for the NBA.Charles Barkley, Clyde Drexler, Julius Erving, George Gervin, Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan, Hakeem Olajuwon, Shaquille O'Neal, Isiah Thomas, and James Worthy. After Dawkins and Willoughby, no high school player went directly to the NBA for 20 years, although Lloyd Daniels and Shawn Kemp went to the NBA without having played college basketball (both had enrolled in college, but never played). That would change in 1995 with the arrival of future NBA MVP Kevin Garnett, who was selected fifth overall. The following year, another future MVP in Kobe Bryant and a future All-Star in Jermaine O'Neal were first-round picks out of high school. Most years after that saw at least one, and often more, high schoolers drafted, most notably Tracy McGrady (1997), Kwame Brown (the first high schooler to be the #1 overall pick, in 2001), Amar'e Stoudemire (2002), LeBron James (#1 in 2003), and Dwight Howard (#1 in 2004). However, the influx of high schoolers caused considerable controversy. When the NBA and its players union negotiated a new Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) in 2005, NBA Commissioner David Stern publicly called for a higher age limit of 20, stating that he wanted the league's scouts and general managers out of high school gyms and that too many young urban Americans incorrectly saw the NBA as a sure path to fame and financial security. Most of the players were opposed to an age limit; Jermaine O'Neal was perhaps the most strident critic, accusing the NBA of racism. Ultimately, the union reluctantly agreed to an age limit of 19, accepting it in exchange for tweaks to salary cap rules that were favorable to the players' interests. The current eligibility rules were established under the NBA's collective bargaining agreement (CBA), which expired in , resulting in a lockout. The previous CBA, approved in December 2011, made no changes to the draft rules, but called for the NBA and its players union to form a committee to discuss draft-related issues. In 2016, the NBA and NBA Players Association met to work on a new CBA, which both sides approved in December of that year. This most recent agreement started with the 2017‚Äì18 season and will run through 2023‚Äì24, with a mutual opt-out after 2022‚Äì23. The basic rules that started in the 2006 draft are: * All drafted players must be at least 19 years old during the calendar year of the draft. To determine whether a player is eligible for a given year's draft, subtract 19 from the year of the draft. If the player was born during or before that year, he is eligible. * Any player who is not an \\"international player\\", as defined in the CBA, must be at least one year removed from the graduation of his high school class. The \\"one year out of high school\\" requirement is in addition to the age requirement. For example, although O. J. Mayo turned 19 in November 2006, six months before his high school graduation, he was not eligible until the 2008 draft, a year after his high school class graduated. Stern stated the rules were business-related and not a \\"social program\\", citing the need to see players perform against higher competition before they are evaluated for valuable draft picks. The rule effectively mandated that players spend at least one year in college. High school players who would otherwise have jumped directly into the NBA were instead playing in college for the required year before leaving and entering the draft‚Äîa phenomenon known as one and done. Some colleges have embraced this rule to their advantage, notably the University of Kentucky and Duke University, among others. Many of their players have played the one mandatory year, leaving after their freshman season to enter the draft. The NBA G League (formerly Development League) is one alternative to college. Players can earn five-figure salaries, but the level of competition is possibly lower than in the Division I level in college. Some players, most notably Brandon Jennings, have also played overseas in lieu of college. However, in recent years, other players like Satnam Singh, Thon Maker, and Matur Maker have looked to enter the NBA draft while still being high schoolers by exploiting a loophole where they enter the draft as high school postgraduates. In April 2018, a report from the Commission on College Basketball was released. It recommended, among its findings, the abolishment of the \\"one-and-done\\" rule, thus high school players can be directly eligible for the draft again. The NBA notified its member teams in a memorandum later in June that the earliest possible draft without the one-year rule (not named in the memo), among eligibility changes, was initially in 2021, only to be moved forward in October to 2022. The NBA looks to revert their ruling from 2005 to change the age limit back to 18 again with a recent report from February 2019.http://www.nba.com/article/2019/02/21/nba-and-union-look-end-one-and-done ===Automatic eligibility=== Players whose 19th birthday falls during or before the calendar year of the draft, or at least one year removed from the graduation of their high school class, and who do not meet the criteria for \\"international\\" players are automatically eligible if they meet any of the following criteria: * They have completed four years of their college eligibility. * If they graduated from high school in the U.S., but did not enroll in a U.S. college or university, four years have passed since their high school class graduated. * They have signed a contract with a professional basketball team outside the NBA, anywhere in the world, and have played under that contract. They also must be released from their contract before they can leave college to go to the NBA Those who have reached the minimum eligibility age of 19 and meet the criteria for \\"international\\" players are automatically eligible if they meet any of the following criteria: * They are at least 22 during the calendar year of the draft. * They have signed a contract with a professional basketball team outside the NBA within the United States, and have played under that contract. ===\\"Early entry\\" player=== Players who are not automatically eligible but wish to be drafted must declare their eligibility no later than 60 days before the draft. After this date, \\"early entry\\" players may attend NBA pre-draft camps and individual team workouts to show off their skills and obtain feedback regarding their draft positions. Under the CBA, a player may withdraw his name from consideration from the draft at any time before the final declaration date, which is 10 days before the draft. However, the NCAA adopted a rule that took effect in August 2009 that requires players at its member institutions to withdraw no later than May 8 to retain their college eligibility; the first draft affected by this rule was the 2010 draft. In 2011, the NCAA shortened its timeline for players to withdraw and retain eligibility to one day before the start of the spring signing period for men's basketball, which occurs in April. The NCAA changed its withdrawal rule again in 2016, effective with that year's draft; its withdrawal deadline is now in late May, specifically 10 days after the final day of the annual NBA Draft Combine. Due to disruptions brought about by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the NCAA announced that for the 2020 draft, the withdrawal deadline was changed to 10 days after the combine or August 3, whichever comes first. A player who declares for the draft and stays in it loses his college eligibility when he is drafted. He can sign with any agent following an evaluation from the NBA Undergraduate Advisory Committee, and if he ends up undrafted, he has the opportunity to return to his school for at least another year only after terminating all agreements with that agent, effective with the 2019 draft; until 2018, college players lost their eligibility when they signed with their agents and stayed in the draft, only to be left undrafted. Before 2016, the NCAA only allowed a player to enter the draft once without losing eligibility, but current NCAA rules now allow players to declare for and withdraw from multiple drafts while retaining college eligibility. The CBA allows a player to withdraw twice. ===Definition of international players=== The CBA defines \\"international players\\" for draft purposes as those who meet all of the following criteria: * Permanently reside outside the U.S. for at least three years before the draft while playing basketball outside the U.S. * Have never enrolled in a U.S. college or university. * Did not complete high school in the U.S. Note that this definition is very different from what the NBA uses in listing \\"international players\\" on its team rosters. For that purpose, the league defines an \\"international player\\" specifically as one born outside the 50 United States or the District of Columbia, even if that player's parent is a natural-born American. Also of note is that a prospective player's birthplace is not relevant to his definition as an \\"international player\\" for draft purposes. By contrast, the WNBA requires that, for purposes of its draft, \\"international players\\" be born outside the U.S. ===Reaction of high school players=== In the third annual High School Hoops magazine,Bodenburg, Rob, Ryan Canner-O'mealy, Jon Mahoney, and Ben Sylvan. \\"Scouting the Nation.\\" High School Hoops 2005: 16-17. the players weighed in on the subject of the new rules regarding draft eligibility. Many of them felt that it was unfair. Kansas State freshman Bill Walker, said (as a junior in high school), \\"I'm against it. I don't see why you have to be 19 to play a game of basketball when you can be 18 and go to war for our country and die. It's ridiculous.\\" Jerryd Bayless said \\"It's not fair at all. If a tennis player can go pro at 13, I don't understand why a basketball player can't go pro at 18.\\" A possible number one pick out of high school, had the rule not been put in place, was Greg Oden (though he was still picked first in 2007). When asked about the agreement he said \\"It's unfair, but it's over with now, so there's no reason to complain.\\" In spite of the claims that the rule is unfair, Wayne Ellington of North Carolina, said that \\"‚Ä¶I also think it's going to help the league a little bit. Some guys who come in, like from this year's draft, it will help.\\" Brandan Wright said that \\"It may hurt guys who need money, but it will help people grow and develop.\\" On the specific topic of Oden entering the draft, Jack Keefer, Oden's high school coach at Lawrence North, Indiana, said, \\"I really think he thought he was going to college. He seems to be more at ease with himself right now. I think the stress came with worrying about the NBA.\\"Mahoney, Jon. \\"Next Question?\\" High School Hoops 2005: 38-39. While a lot of high school players just accepted that this is just how it is, some object to this rule. They said that it puts excess stress on them because they start being recruited in their junior year of high school. If they have a bad season it could ruin their chances to get into college and therefore into the NBA. It can also be stressful picking a college to play at, which can be unneeded stress if a player decides to leave after only one year. ===Alternates to college basketball=== While playing college basketball has been the most popular option for players coming out of high school, some have opted for alternative options. Oklahoma City Thunder guard Terrance Ferguson had originally committed to Alabama then Arizona, but then decided to play in Australia for the Adelaide 36ers. He has urged others to do the same, saying: \\"Most one-and-done players only spend a few months in college. You have to do schoolwork and all this other stuff. You go overseas, you spend the same amount of months, but you‚Äôre focusing straight on basketball. I feel like more players should do it.\\" Another argument he made is that he gets paid for playing overseas, while college players don't receive pay, which is one of the biggest issues players have with going to college. Another alternative that can be taken is instead of playing, players may take a year off to train. Recently drafted Portland Trail Blazers guard Anfernee Simons decided to skip out on college altogether, and instead opted to spend a year at the IMG Academy. Simons explained his reasoning for skipping college by saying, ‚ÄúI feel like in college you got three classes a day. That‚Äôs a big thing ‚Äî a lot of time. That‚Äôs basically time that I was able to spend in the gym getting better.‚Äù ===Changes for college underclassmen in 2016=== In March 2015, following a series of meetings that began at the 2014 men's Final Four, the NBA, NCAA, and the trade association for college men's coaches, the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC), announced a plan that would give college underclassmen a better opportunity to make an informed decision about their NBA status than the then-current system. Under this plan: * The NCAA would no longer automatically treat entry into the draft as forfeiture of remaining college eligibility. Instead, it would allow underclassmen to withdraw from the draft in late May, about five weeks after the then-current deadline, and retain their remaining eligibility (as long as they do not sign with an agent or a professional basketball team in the meantime). The NBA's early-entry and withdrawal deadlines, respectively 60 days and 10 days before the draft, would not change because they are written into the league's collective bargaining agreement. * The NBA would expand its invitation-only draft combine, currently held in Chicago, to include players with remaining college eligibility (who would also have to be invited in order to attend). The stated purpose of this expansion was to allow underclassmen to receive feedback from NBA teams on their draft prospects. According to one NCAA executive, the expanded combine would involve from 20 to 30% more players than the approximately 70 who participated at that time. The NCAA rule change was formally presented by the NCAA men's basketball oversight committee on June 24, 2015, and was approved by the NCAA Division I council on January 13, 2016. The new rule, which took effect with the 2016 draft, specifically sets the new withdrawal date at 10 days after the end of the NBA draft combine. Additionally, players may declare for the draft multiple times without losing college eligibility, as long as they withdraw before the new deadline without hiring an agent or signing a professional basketball contract, and are now allowed to attend the draft combine and one tryout per year for each NBA team without losing college eligibility. However, it has been stated that current commissioner Adam Silver has been working to change this rule and meeting with NCAA officials to make the changes for the betterment of the NBA and NCAA basketball players, teams, and coaches alike. ==Notes and references== Category:National Basketball Association draft ","title":"Eligibility for the NBA draft"},{"id":"20205905","text":"\\"Love Screw\\" is MAX's 26th single on the Avex Trax label. ==Track list== {  - bgcolor=\\"#CCCCCC\\" ! # !! width=\\"350\\"Title !!

It was replaced by Veikkausliiga in 1990. In 1930 league format was used for the first time to decide Finnish champion. Before that from 1908 to 1929 the championship was decided with cup competition. The league was dominated by clubs from Helsinki, Turku and Vyborg. The first champion was HIFK Fotboll from Helsinki. In 1935 four best clubs were from Helsinki and in 1934 and 1936 top three clubs also came from Helsinki. From 1908 to 1940 the championship went outside Helsinki on only six occasions. Kuopio was the first inland city to get into the league when Pallotoverit were promoted in 1938. During World War II years the league was sometimes cut short, abandoned or decided with cup competition instead. In 1940s TUL clubs also participated. The last Mestaruussarja season was 1989 and FC Kuusysi was crowned as the last champions. The new top level division was at first called SM-liiga and later renamed as Veikkausliiga.

Developed slowly from the 1960s, it had a population of 1157 at the 2013 Census. The suburb is located on the eastern side of the Hutt River at the base of the Eastern Hutt Valley Hills and Emerald Hill, with SH2 running right through it. It is bordered by Timberlea to the east (at the intersection of SH2 and Norana Road in the northeast), Maoribank to the south of SH2 at Moeraki Road, and Birchville just past the northern side of Harcourt Park on Akatarawa Road. T≈çtara Park can be accessed by foot by crossing the Harcourt Park Bridge at the end of Norbert Street. Brown Owl is serviced by a small shopping centre on Akatarawa Road and a Caltex service station on SH2 opposite Moeraki Road. == Subdivisions == Brown Owl is split into three distinctive areas: The main central part of Brown Owl was mostly developed between 1970 and 1990, and contains all of the businesses in Brown Owl. On the south- western side of Emerald Hill are four streets which contain houses that offer expansive views across the Upper Hutt Valley. The main street, Sunnyview Drive, regularly contains a Christmas lights exhibition annually in December; many of the residents light up their houses and the street with extensive lights displays. It can be seen right across the Upper Hutt Valley. This area was mainly developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Next to the river and Te Haukaretu Park is the Riverglade subdivision. This modern subdivision, developed between the early 1990s and mid-2000s, contains large executive homes; with many of these homes having views across Te Haukaretu Park towards the Hutt River. == Parks == There are three public parks in Brown Owl: Brown Owl Park; Located off of SH2 (access point from Speargrass Grove, Timberlea also), contains some bush and a small trail. Te Haukaretu Park; Located at the end of Norbert Street next to the Harcourt Park Bridge, this picturesque park runs along the eastern bank of the Hutt River.

Wellington's Kiwi Holiday Park is located on its northern side off of Akaratawa Road. The Hutt River Trail runs along the western edge of the park. Harcourt Park is a very good spot to witness river terracing. The Gardens of Isengard in the Lord Of The Rings trilogy was filmed in Harcourt Park. == Schools == Brown Owl used to have a school (Brown Owl School), but this school closed in 2002. The nearest primary schools are Maoribank School and Birchville School.

It was named after Pearce's employers, James Veitch & Sons of Chelsea, London. It can be found today in the mountains around Machu Picchu. A later plant collector, Walter Davis, found Begonia veitchii inhabiting rocky positions by waterfalls, in company with Masdevallia veitchiana. Begonia veitchii played an important role in the development of today's popular hybrid cultivars and, together with Pearce's other introductions, B. boliviensis and B. pearcei, was subsequently hybridized to produce the Begonia √ó tuberhybrida cultivar group. ==Description== The flowers are bright red-orange. They have rounded petals and are displayed on strong erect stalks well above the foliage. According to Hortus Veitchii, Sir Joseph Dalton Hooker, writing in the Botanical Magazine, described this as \\"the finest species then known\\", saying: > \\"Of all the species of Begonia known, this is, I think, the finest. With the > habit of Saxifraga ciliata, immense flowers of a vivid vermilion cinnabar- > red, that no colorist can reproduce, it adds the novel feature of being > hardy in certain parts of England at any rate, if not in all.\\" ==References *Begonia veitchii photographs veitchii Category:Flora of Peru Category:Veitch Nurseries ","title":"Begonia veitchii"},{"id":"20206051","text":"Yellow Bear, Mato «¶√≠ ( 1844‚Äì1913), was an Oglala Lakota leader. ==The first Yellow Bear== The first Yellow Bear was a prominent headman among the Tapisleca Tiyospaye (translated as the Spleen or Melt Band), one of the major divisions of the southern Oglala Lakota. He accompanied the first Oglala delegation to Washington, D.C. in 1870. By the following year, Colonel John E. Smith rated the size of this leader's village at about 40 lodges, one of the largest family groups within the Tapisleca Band. Yellow Bear was murdered in 1872 near Fort Laramie during a fight with the controversial white trader John Richard Jr.William Garnett Interviews, Ricker Papers, Nebraska State Historical Society. Published in: Donald F. Danker, \\"The Violent Deaths of Yellow Bear and John Richard Jr.,\\" Nebraska History 63 (1982):137-51; Richard E. Jensen (ed.), Voices of the American West, Volume 1, The Indian Interviews of Eli S. Ricker, 1903-1919 (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 2005) pp. 104-113. As the Lakota reservations were being established following the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868, the majority of the Tapisleca gave up their buffalo hunting way of life and settled at the Red Cloud Agency. By 1874, leadership of Yellow Bear's band appears to have passed to his younger brother, Black Hawk. At about this same time, another Oglala named Yellow Bear began to emerge among the Tapisleca, perhaps another \\"brother\\" (in the widest Lakota sense).Catherine Price, The Oglala People, 1841-1879: A Political History (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1996) ==Great Sioux War of 1876-77== Born about 1844 or 1845, Yellow Bear was one of several younger Oglala leaders who came into prominence among the Lakota during the Great Sioux War of 1876-77. With the traditional avenues of a warrior no longer available, he is an example of how a new generation of leaders found success as an intermediary between the U.S. government and the Lakota people. Yellow Bear enlisted as a scout in General George Crook's Indian Scouts in the fall of 1876 and he participated in the Powder River Expedition, fighting alongside the Army against the Northern Cheyenne in the Dull Knife Fight.Register of Enlistments, Indians Scouts, National Archives. Charles M. Robinson III, The Diaries of John Gregory Bourke, vol. 2 (Denton, TX: University of North Texas Press, 2005) p. 155. By February 1877, Yellow Bear had been promoted to sergeant in Company B, Indian Scouts, and he was recognized as the primary headman or spokesman of the Tapisleca band at the Red Cloud Agency, indications of his growing influence. Photographer D. S. Mitchell included a portrait of Yellow Bear in his series of prominent Oglala portraits taken that summer or fall.Ephriam D. Dickson III, Crazy Horse's Contemporaries: D. S. Mitchell's Native Portraits from the Red Cloud Agency, Nebraska, 1877 (in prep.) During the excitement over Crazy Horse in the fall of 1877, Yellow Bear attended the council with other Oglala headmen. When Indian scouts were used to surround Crazy Horse's village on September 4, Yellow Bear was not present but he sent word that he agreed with the action. In the fall of 1877, he was selected as one of the Oglala delegates together with Red Cloud sent to Washington, D.C. to meet with the president. \\"I want to know now which is the best way we can live for a long time,\\" he told President Hayes. \\"I have a band of my own and I have come down to work for them.\\"James C. Olson, Red Cloud and the Sioux Problem (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1965)p. 243-248. ==Later life== Yellow Bear married his first wife, Wild Horse, about 1870. About four years later, he married his wife's younger sister, Holy Day. Together, the family bore eight children, four of whom grew to adulthood. As the Oglala settled on the Pine Ridge Agency after 1878, the family bands within the Tapisleca established various communities. Yellow Bear's community, known as the Shkokpaya, settled just northwest of Allen, South Dakota, within what later became known as the Pass Creek District of the reservation. The 1890 Pine Ridge census lists the Shkokpaya with 22 families or 99 people. Among the band members listed was Imitates Dog (Sunka Onca), a brother of Yellow Bear. Other sisters of Yellow Bear's wives married Yellow Hawk and Little Crow, both also members of the Shkokpaya. Another prominent member of the Shkokpaya was Pawnee Killer, though his relationship to Yellow Bear is not known.Pine Ridge Agency Census, 1890, National Archives. Yellow Bear continued to serve as a prominent Oglala leader at Pine Ridge, again traveling to Washington, D.C. in 1888. He died September 1, 1913 near Allen, South Dakota.Annuity Rolls, 1914, Pine Ridge Agency Records, Kansas City Regional Archives. In 1965, Leonard Nimoy played Yellow Bear in the episode \\"The Journey\\" of the syndicated western television series, Death Valley Days. In the story line, two cavalry officers, Richard Henry Pratt (Wayne Rogers) and Sergeant Wilks (Robert J. Wilke) clash over treatment of Indian prisoners. ==Notes== Category:1844 births Category:1913 deaths Category:Lakota leaders Category:Native American people of the Indian Wars ","title":"Yellow Bear"},{"id":"20206072","text":"Arshad Mehmood is a Pakistani actor, Music composer, and a singer.Four-day international music festival begins Dawn (newspaper), Published 2 Dec 2014, Retrieved 6 February 2018 ==Early life and career== He had started composing music for Pakistan Television Corporation back in 1972.

AIC produced a 12-episode anime adaptation in 2010, with four additional episodes streamed online in 2011.

Bandai Namco Games developed three visual novel video games from 2011 to 2013 for the PlayStation Portable and PlayStation 3 consoles. ==Plot== Kyosuke Kosaka, a normal 17-year-old high school student living in Chiba, has not gotten along with his younger sister Kirino in years. For longer than he can remember, Kirino has ignored his comings and goings and looked at him with spurning eyes. It seemed as if the relationship between Kyosuke and his sister, now fourteen, would continue this way forever. One day however, Kyosuke finds a DVD case of a magical girl anime which had fallen in his house's entranceway. To Kyosuke's surprise, he finds a hidden eroge inside the case and he soon learns that both the DVD and the game belong to Kirino. That night, Kirino brings Kyosuke to her room and reveals herself to be an otaku with an extensive collection of moe anime and younger-sister-themed eroge she has been collecting in secret. Kyosuke quickly becomes Kirino's confidant for her secret hobby. The series then follows Kyosuke's efforts to help his sister to reconcile her personal life with her secret hobbies, while restoring their broken relationship and coming to terms with their true feelings for each other. ==CharactersMain=== ; : :Kyosuke is the 17 year-old protagonist of Oreimo. He has a distant relationship with his sister, and feels that this will never change. However, this suddenly changes when he finds one of her eroge and, after confronting her with it, learns that she is an otaku. Through this experience he realizes that he knows very little about his sister, including her being a model as well as an exemplary student. He decides to become more of an older brother to her. Despite Kyosuke being older, his sister is generally the dominant person in their relationship, with Kyosuke only standing up to her in truly serious situations. Kyosuke initially claims to prefer a relatively peaceful and simple life, but grows to enjoy spending time with his sister as well as the drama she causes to the point where he becomes lonely when she is not around. Kyosuke helped Ruri make friends and joins the Game Research Club with her during his third year when Ruri becomes his junior. Kyosuke dates Ruri during summer vacation but she breaks up with him. In the Oreimo: Kuroneko spin-off manga, the two wind up back together ten years later as an alternate ending to the canonical story written in the original light novels. :In the past, Kyosuke had good grades and was the fastest runner in his elementary school. He also had the tendency to shoulder everything himself, thinking that there was nothing that he could not achieve, and often said \\"Leave it to me\\". However, after a hiking accident, Kyosuke was convinced by Manami that he should not try so hard at everything, which drastically changed his personality. He turned into someone who only desired to live a normal lifestyle, and his studies and athleticism worsened over time. ; : :Kirino is Kyosuke's 14 year-old younger sister. She is normally mature and independent for her age. However, this is a facade and she only reveals her true personality‚Äîimmature, abusive, and ungrateful with an aggressive, tsundere-like character‚Äîto Kyosuke, whom she orders to play her games and care for the characters, only to accuse him of being a pervert and a lolicon. She is secretly an otaku with an obsession for \\"little sister\\"-themed eroge, as well as the children's anime series Stardust Witch Meruru. She works as a magazine model and later becomes a novelist, the funds from which she uses to support her hobby. Despite her interests, she states she does not know why she started liking eroge and denies having a brother complex. Nevertheless, she frequently forces Kyosuke to spend time with her, whether it is playing games or taking her out, but denies that she actually enjoys the time they spend together. :Kirino is also shown to become frustrated whenever Kyosuke is with or shows interest in other girls. She even goes so far as to sabotage his time with another girl. Despite this, she is genuinely grateful to her brother. Although she states that she only likes eroge because of their cute characters, she shows a perverted side of herself when playing those games. She uses the screen name Kiririn when with her otaku friends. She used to admire Kyosuke in the past, whom she saw as a perfect brother. Kyosuke started distancing himself from her during elementary school. Kirino once tried to chase after Kyosuke (who ran away to play with his friends) but she tripped and cried in disappointment. This spurred her to start working hard on her academics and sports. She was also severely disappointed in Kyosuke's change in personality after the incident with Akimi. ; : :Ruri is a 15 year- old otaku girl who lives near Kirino and later enrolls in Kyosuke's school. She often wears gothic lolita clothing based on a character from her favorite anime, even during hot weather, and will sometimes add cat ears and a tail. She calls herself Kuroneko (black cat) and wears contact lenses to make her blue eyes appear red. Due to both of their tsundere-type personalities, she constantly clashes with Kirino. However, both girls genuinely care for each other and value the time they spend together. Like Kirino, Kuroneko is very prideful but is willing to swallow her pride to achieve a goal. Unlike Kirino, who likes little sister-themed games and magical girl anime, Kuroneko enjoys teen-centered fantasy anime. She often mentions \\"dark magic\\", claiming that she has it. She is noted to have a very large vocabulary - Kirino once comments that she needed to use a dictionary to translate her novel. :Kuroneko has two younger sisters, Hinata and Tamaki, whom she cares for dearly, although they and her mother worry about Ruri when she is in otaku mode. At school, Kuroneko wears normal clothes and at home takes care of her younger sisters. She later joins the video game club after she enrolls into Kyosuke's school; she is very good at playing video games. She dates Kyosuke for over summer vacation before breaking up with him. :The Oreimo: Kuroneko spin-off manga, written by author Tsukasa Fushimi, sets an alternate ending to the original canonical story. Ruri still breaks up with him as to not upset Kirino, but he tells her to wait for him. In the manga's epilogue set ten years later, the couple are married, and have at least three children together. ; : :Saori is the leader of the \\"Anime Girls Unite!\\" group on the Internet, whom Kirino encounters in a meet-up. She wears very thick glasses (shown as swirls) and speaks with an exaggerated tone. She is a fan of Gundam (her alias is named after the character, Quattro Bajeena) and is also a collector of their model kits. Despite her general appearance in public, Saori is actually from a wealthy family and speaks formally when not with her friends. As Kyosuke notes, Saori is drastically different in person as compared to how she communicates over the Internet or the phone. :According to Kyosuke, she dresses as a stereotypical otaku, but has the body of a supermodel. She is tall and usually has to have cosplay costumes tailor made for her. Despite being a middle school girl around Kirino and Kuroneko's ages, she is around the same height as Kyosuke, which surprises him when he first meets her. Despite her cheery attitude, Saori is quite lonely, living by herself, and has always feared that one day her true friends (Kirino, Kyosuke, and Ruri) will leave her in a similar way that her older sister (who married and moved away) left her. The reason she set up a hobby group of her own is that she was \\"just the sister of a member\\" of her sister's hobby group \\"Pretty Garden,\\" and was severely disappointed and angry when the group eventually dissolved after her sister moved away. ; : :Ayase is Kirino's classmate who is her best friend and also works as a model. She admired Kirino for being seemingly perfect in every way and she used to have a crush on Kyosuke, thinking of him as Kirino's caring brother. She was greatly disappointed when she found out about Kirino's otaku hobby and how Kyosuke was aware of it and helped support it. Ayase later reconciled with Kirino, but not as much with Kyosuke. Ayase is normally a friendly, nice, and refined girl, but becomes agitated and somewhat violent at the thought that she is being lied to, which she hates above all else. She also believes what she hears on the news, thus explaining her disapproval of anime and manga, calling it a disgusting hobby, especially eroge, due to the media's portrayal that otaku will eventually become criminals. Once she develops a dislike and contempt for someone, she shows a much ruder and even hostile side of herself. She stubbornly maintains a strong dislike and disrespect for Kyosuke, convincing herself that he is really the pervert she persistently calls him. She becomes good friends with Manami and often confides private matters to her. She eventually overcomes her prejudice and harbors romantic feelings for Kyosuke. ; : :Manami is Kyosuke's childhood friend. She wears glasses and is described as \\"plain\\", something she views as a compliment from Kyosuke. She has a crush on Kyosuke and blushes whenever he compliments her. Due to the amount time they spend together, people around them assume that they are dating. Kyosuke explains that although he does not have feelings for her beyond being close friends, for some reason he does not like the idea of Manami having a boyfriend. Kyosuke is unaware of the many times that Manami has attempted to become closer to him by trying to do things that couples do and how she is willingly doing things to please him in any way, such as cooking and cleaning. According to Kyosuke, her speech patterns resemble those of a grandmother or an old lady. After Kyosuke's accident it was Manami who convinced him to stop trying his best in everything, and made him into the average person today, which severely disappointed Kirino and caused the rift between her and Kirino. She manages to make up with Kirino after Kyosuke gets them to talk. Manami later confesses to Kyosuke but he rejects her. ; : :Kanako is Kirino and Ayase's fellow friend, classmate and model, who sometimes swaps between a cute and a bratty personality. She is a talented singer who dreams of becoming an idol and attends many auditions. She frequently goes to karaoke and is capable of perfectly remembering any song that she has heard once. She is unaware of Kirino's hobby and generally finds anime childish and otaku disgusting, though on one occasion she was tricked into cosplaying as Kirino's favorite anime character, Meruru, for a contest and won. Despite winning the contest, she was disgusted by what she had gone through, but liked the idea of being praised and the event even helped her career. She later realized that Kyosuke, who acted as her manager, was Kirino's brother. She also asked Manami to teach her to cook in order to be able to cook for her parents. ; : :K≈çhei's little sister and a member of the Games Research club, as well as Ruri's classmate. Similar to Kirino, she has an obsession with eroge, albeit she prefers hardcore yaoi. She even fantasies about her other clubmates, imagining her brother and Kyosuke as a couple and becoming visibly disappointed when Kyosuke assures her that he is straight. The relationship she has with her brother is quite strong yet it is unclear how they feel about each other. She joined the Games Research club in order to learn how to become a games designer. She is also very good at games, and skilled in programming. In volume 12, she ends up dating Makabe. ===Supporting=== ; : :He is Kirino and Kyosuke's domineering father. He is a high-ranking police officer and has a no nonsense policy at home. He does not like the fact that Kirino is a model, but allows her to do so if she does well in school. He is severely against otaku, believing them to be a waste of a life, so when he finds out Kirino is one, he orders her to throw away all of her otaku-related material. When Kyosuke challenges him, he allows her to keep everything except the eroge, although Kyosuke manages to protect even that by claiming that they belong to him. He is shown to truly care for Kirino despite his gruff exterior, as he has saved every article and picture of all her accomplishments. He claims that he knows best of what is going on in the family and he has always known that the eroge belonged to Kirino, despite Kyosuke's effort to convince him otherwise. In Ore no Im≈çto ga Konna ni Kawaii Wake ga Nai Portable ga Tsuzuku Wake ga Nai, he is Kyosuke's uncle. ; : :She is Kirino and Kyosuke's loving mother. She is aware of her daughter's obsession, as she has referred to her as \\"my otaku daughter\\". She is aware of many things going on in her family and helps keep the peace in the house. She is the first one to question the improving relationship between Kyosuke and Kirino, which in turn resulted in Kyosuke moving out in order to prepare for his examinations. However, she never considered Kyosuke and Kirino to have an unhealthy relationship and was instead using this improved relationship in order to improve Kyosuke's grades. In Ore no Im≈çto ga Konna ni Kawaii Wake ga Nai Portable ga Tsuzuku Wake ga Nai, she is Kyosuke's aunt. ; : :Manami's little brother, whose attempts to follow the cool trends often backfire on him. He sports a buzzcut having been convinced that he was getting a skinhead look. It is hinted that he formed a pact with Kirino during primary school to boycott Kyosuke and Manami, but apologized to Kyosuke after Kyosuke helped him in school and has been a loyal follower of Kyosuke since then. ; : :Kyosuke's classmate who, similar to Kyosuke, often has to support his little sister's hobby for eroge. Unlike Kyosuke's strained relationship with Kirino, K≈çhei's relationship with Sena is much better, although Kyosuke considers him to be somewhat of a siscon. While he is a huge siscon, his feelings for his little sister are completely unromantic and only loves her as a little sister. ; : :The president of the Games Research club at Kyosuke's school, which both Kyosuke and Ruri end up joining. He is also into little sister-themed eroge and Kyosuke first meets him when trying to borrow a bike to ride home following a midnight eroge launch. ; : :Kaede is a second year member of the Games Research club, and also the most normal member of the club. He dates Sena in volume 12 and calls K≈çhei \\"Aniki\\". ; : :Iori is the editor who published Kirino's work. In the Light Novel, she stole Kirino's work and passed it off as her own. ; : :Misaki is the president of Eternal Blue who tried to persuade Kirino to pursue a modelling career abroad. ; : :K≈çki is a model who is secretly an otaku. Kirino asked him to pretend to be her boyfriend in order to make Kyosuke understand how she felt when he hung out with other girls. Later on, he befriended Kyosuke and helped him several times, such as giving dating advice. However, he also caused trouble for Kyosuke, such as when he gave Kyosuke an expensive set of adult game figures as a housewarming gift. ; : :The elder of Ruri's little sisters. Despite her young age, she is able to understand the situation her sister is in. She once thought that her sister was pretending to have a boyfriend and was surprised to find out that Kyosuke was real. She also understands the circumstances of Ruri's breakup with Kyosuke. ; : :The younger of Ruri's little sisters. She was scared by Kirino's beastly act upon seeing her. She loves her older sisters dearly and gets along well with Kyosuke. ; : :Bridget is the winner of the first Meruru cosplay event. However, she lost to Kanako in the second event. She later grew to be quite close to Kanako. ; : :Ria is Kirino's roommate during her stay in the United States who devotes her life to running. Known as the fastest elementary school runner, Kirino outran her when Kyosuke came to pick Kirino up in the United States. Ria came to Japan seeking revenge, and was able to beat Kirino in another race. ; : :Kaori is Saori's elder sister who created the group \\"Pretty Garden,\\" which Saori participated in. However, she left a bad impression on Saori after she left for America, which caused Pretty Garden to dissolve and eventually influenced Saori to create her own hobby group. It is revealed that after the misunderstandings between the sisters was solved, they became close. ; : :Kanata is Kanako's sister and a manga author who was a prominent member of Pretty Garden. She was Saori's biggest influence in her otaku hobbies. ; : :Shinya was another prominent member of Pretty Garden. ; :Sayaka is the owner of Ayase's fan blog who stalks Ayase. Sayaka admires Ayase, and was disappointed in the misunderstanding that Ayase started dating Kyosuke as Ayase went to Kyosuke's house every day during his mock-exam period. Kyosuke eventually mediated the relationship between Sayaka and Ayase while Sayaka said that she aspires to be a photographer. ; : :Akimi is Kyosuke's middle school classmate who refused to come to school during middle school. After several attempts, Kyosuke managed to convince her to come to school and even forged her parents' signature so that she could go on a field trip. Unfortunately Akimi was injured falling from a tree in a restricted area that Kyosuke brought her to. As a result, her parents moved her to another school and forbade Kyosuke from interacting with her again, which was the main cause for Kyosuke's change in personality. Three years after the incident, Akimi managed to find Kyosuke and confessed to him, but was rejected. ==MediaLight novels=== Oreimo began as a light novel series written by Tsukasa Fushimi, with illustrations provided by Hiro Kanzaki.

The opening theme for the anime is \\"Irony\\" by ClariS and is composed by Kz of Livetune, while each episode features a different ending theme sung by one of the voice actors. The music of the anime is composed by Satoru K≈çsaki and a soundtrack was released on January 12, 2011. Aniplex of America began streaming and simulcasting the series in North America through Anime News Network (ANN), but security issues involving the illegal leaking of episode two online resulted in the stream being placed on hold. The stream of Oreimo returned to ANN with the first four episodes on November 8, 2010. Aniplex of America released the series on an English-subtitled DVD box set in October 2011. The anime is licensed by MVM Films in the United Kingdom. Oreimo train of Chiba Urban Monorail A second 13-episode anime season, titled and produced by A-1 Pictures, aired between April 7 and June 30, 2013 and was simulcast by Crunchyroll. An additional three episodes were screened at Otakon 2013 on August 9, 2013, and then streamed worldwide on August 18. The episodes were simulcast by Crunchyroll at the same time as the Japanese broadcast and were available until August 31, 2013. Despite the change in animation studio from the first season, the second season has the same staff as the first. The opening theme is \\"Reunion\\" by ClariS, while a contest was held for the second season's ending themes. This series has also been licensed by Aniplex of America. A-1 Pictures collaborated with Chiba Urban Monorail to promote the second season by making an Oreimo-themed monorail train, which remained in operation until September 30, 2013. In addition to decorating the exterior of the train, the anime characters were featured in in-train advertising to provide passengers with helpful tips about local sightseeing facilities and shops. In addition to their own series, the characters from Oreimo also make cameo appearances in the episodes of the anime adaptation of Eromanga Sensei, another light novel series written by Fushimi and illustrated by Kanzaki. ===Video games=== A PlayStation Portable visual novel titled Ore no Im≈çto ga Konna ni Kawaii Wake ga Nai Portable was developed by Bandai Namco Games and released on January 27, 2011. The limited edition bundle included an OAD, a sister-talk bonus CD, and an additional game for the PSP. A fighting game titled , based on the fictional game in the series, was released by Kadokawa Contents Gate on the Yahoo! MobaGe Service on January 20, 2011. A second PSP title, , was released on May 17, 2012. The opening theme of the second PSP game is \\"Nexus\\" by ClariS. A PlayStation 3 game, , was released on September 26, 2013 in Japan. Kirino also makes a cameo appearance in the A Certain Magical Index PSP game, being another game based on a light novel series published by ASCII Media Works. Kirino also appears as a playable character in Dengeki Bunko: Fighting Climax, with Kuroneko as a supporting character. ==Reception== The Mainichi Shimbun reported that the fourth volume sold the most copies of any light novel in August 2009. Anime News Network (ANN) reported in April 2012 that the first nine light novels had collectively sold 3.7 million copies in Japan. ANN writer Kim Morrissy cited Oreimo as the series that revived the little sister boom, and made comparisons to Tsukasa Fushimi's later series Eromanga Sensei. Morrissy stated that the key difference between the two, despite sharing a little sister moe theme, is that Oreimo has committed the ultimate incest taboo due to Kyosuke and Kirino being related by blood, whereas the siblings in Eromanga Sensei lack a blood relation, hence \\"allowing the romance to play out with a less direct connection to real-life incest\\". ==NotesReferences *Official website *Anime official website *Visual novel official website * Category:2008 Japanese novels Category:2009 manga Category:2010 anime television series Category:2011 manga Category:2011 video games Category:2012 video games Category:2013 anime television series Category:A-1 Pictures Category:Anime and manga based on light novels Category:Anime International Company Category:Anime ONAs Category:Aniplex Category:Aniplex franchises Category:ASCII Media Works manga Category:Comedy anime and manga Category:Dengeki Bunko Category:Dengeki Comics Category:Dengeki G's Magazine Category:Harem anime and manga Category:Harem video games Category:Incest in anime and manga Category:Japan-exclusive video games Category:Kadokawa Dwango franchises Category:Light novels Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:PlayStation Portable games Category:Seinen manga Category:Television shows based on light novels Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Visual novels ","title":"Oreimo"},{"id":"20206170","text":"John Klass (born February 16, in Singapore) is a singer/producer/songwriter/radio presenter. == Biography == John Klass has been in the entertainment scene since 1991.

The model is based on a foundational principle: \\"If one has maximal knowledge, then for every system, at every time, the amount of knowledge one possesses about the ontic state of the system at that time must equal the amount of knowledge one lacks.\\" This is called the \\"knowledge balance principle\\". Within the bounds of this model, many phenomena typically associated with strictly quantum-mechanical effects are present. These include (but are not limited to) entanglement, noncommutativity of measurements, teleportation, interference, the no-cloning and no-broadcasting theorems, and unsharp measurements. The toy model cannot, however, reproduce quantum nonlocality and quantum contextuality, as it is a local and non-contextual hidden-variable theory. ==Background== For nearly a century, physicists and philosophers have been attempting to explain the physical meaning of quantum states. The argument is typically one between two fundamentally opposed views: the ontic view, which describes quantum states as states of physical reality, and the epistemic view, which describes quantum states as states of our incomplete knowledge about a system. Both views have had strong support over the years; notably, the ontic view was supported by Heisenberg and Schr√∂dinger, and the epistemic view by Einstein. The majority of 20th-century quantum physics was dominated by the ontic view, and it remains the generally accepted view by physicists today. There is, however, a substantial subset of physicists who take the epistemic view. Both views have issues associated with them, as both contradict physical intuition in many cases, and neither has been conclusively proven to be the superior viewpoint. The Spekkens toy model is designed to argue in favour of the epistemic viewpoint. It is, by construction, an epistemic model. The knowledge balance principle of the model ensures that any measurement done on a system within it gives incomplete knowledge of the system, and thus the observable states of the system are epistemic. This model also implicitly assumes that there is an ontic state which the system is in at any given time, but simply that we are unable to observe it. The model can not be used to derive quantum mechanics, as there are fundamental differences between the model and quantum theory. In particular, the model is one of local and noncontextual variables, which Bell's theorem tells us cannot ever reproduce all the predictions of quantum mechanics. The toy model does, however, reproduce a number of strange quantum effects and does so from a strictly epistemic perspective; as such, it can be interpreted as strong evidence in favour of the epistemic view. ==The model== The Spekkens toy model is based on the knowledge balance principle \\"the number of questions about the physical state of a system that are answered must always be equal to the number that are unanswered in a state of maximal knowledge\\". However, the \\"knowledge\\" one can possess about a system must be carefully defined for this principle to have any meaning. To do this, the concept of a canonical set of yes-or-no questions is defined as the minimal number of questions needed. For example, for a system with 4 states, one can ask: \\"Is the system in state 1?\\", \\"Is the system in state 2?\\" and \\"Is the system in state 3?\\", which would determine the state of the system (state 4 being the case if all three questions were answered \\"No.\\"). However, one could also ask: \\"Is the system in either state 1 or state 2?\\" and \\"Is the system in either state 1 or state 3?\\", which would also uniquely determine the state and has only two questions in the set. This set of questions is not unique, however, it is clear that at least two questions (bits) are required to exactly represent one of four states. We say that for a system with 4 states, the number of questions in a canonical set is two. As such, in this case, the knowledge balance principle insists that the maximal number of questions in a canonical set that one can have answered at any given time is one, such that the amount of knowledge is equal to the amount of ignorance. It is also assumed in the model that it is always possible to saturate the inequality, i.e. to have knowledge of the system exactly equal to that which is lacked, and thus at least two questions must be in the canonical set. Since no question is allowed to exactly specify the state of the system, the number of possible ontic states must be at least 4 (if it were less than 4, the model would be trivial, since any question that could be asked may return an answer specifying the exact state of the system, thus no question can be asked). Since a system with four states (described above) exists, it is referred to as an elementary system. The model then also assumes that every system is built out of these elementary systems, and that each subsystem of any system also obeys the knowledge balance principle. ==Elementary systems== For an elementary system, let 1 ‚à® 2 represent the state of knowledge \\"the system is in state 1 or state 2\\". Under this model, there are 6 states of maximal knowledge that can be obtained: 1 ‚à® 2, 1 ‚à® 3, 1 ‚à® 4, 2 ‚à® 3, 2 ‚à® 4 and 3 ‚à® 4. There is also a single state less than maximal knowledge, corresponding to 1 ‚à® 2 ‚à® 3 ‚à® 4. These can be mapped to 6 qubit states in a natural manner: : 1 \\\\lor 2 \\\\iff  0 \\\\rangle, : 3 \\\\lor 4 \\\\iff  1 \\\\rangle, : 1 \\\\lor 3 \\\\iff  + \\\\rangle, : 2 \\\\lor 4 \\\\iff  - \\\\rangle, : 1 \\\\lor 4 \\\\iff  i \\\\rangle, : 2 \\\\lor 3 \\\\iff  -i \\\\rangle, : 1 \\\\lor 2 \\\\lor 3 \\\\lor 4 \\\\iff I/2. Under this mapping, it is clear that two states of knowledge in the toy theory correspond to two orthogonal states for the qubit if and only if they share no ontic states in common. This mapping also gives analogues in the toy model to quantum fidelity, compatibility, convex combinations of states and coherent superposition, and can be mapped to the Bloch sphere in the natural fashion. However, the analogy breaks down to a degree when considering coherent superposition, as one of the forms of the coherent superposition in the toy model returns a state that is orthogonal to what is expected with the corresponding superposition in the quantum model, and this can be shown to be an intrinsic difference between the two systems. This reinforces the earlier point that this model is not a restricted version of quantum mechanics, but instead a separate model that mimics quantum properties. ===Transformations=== The only transformations on the ontic state of the system that respect the knowledge balance principle are permutations of the 4 ontic states. These map valid epistemic states to other valid epistemic states, for instance: : ((12)(34)) (1 \\\\lor 2) \\\\to 1 \\\\lor 2, : ((12)(34)) (1 \\\\lor 3) \\\\to 2 \\\\lor 4, : ((12)(3)(4)) (1 \\\\lor 3) \\\\to 2 \\\\lor 3. Considering again the analogy between the epistemic states of this model and the qubit states on the Bloch sphere, these transformations consist of the typical allowed permutations of the 6 analogous states, as well as a set of permutations that are forbidden in the continuous qubit model. These are transformations such as (12)(3)(4), which correspond to antiunitary maps on Hilbert space. These are not allowed in a continuous model, however in this discrete system they arise as natural transformations. There is, however, an analogy to a characteristically quantum phenomenon, that no allowed transformation functions as a universal state inverter. In this case, this means that there is no single transformation S with the properties : S(1 \\\\lor 2) \\\\to 3 \\\\lor 4, \\\\qquad S(3 \\\\lor 4) \\\\to 1 \\\\lor 2, : S(1 \\\\lor 3) \\\\to 2 \\\\lor 4, \\\\qquad S(2 \\\\lor 4) \\\\to 1 \\\\lor 3, : S(1 \\\\lor 4) \\\\to 2 \\\\lor 3, \\\\qquad S(2 \\\\lor 3) \\\\to 1 \\\\lor 4. ===Measurements=== In the theory, only reproducible measurements (measurements that cause the system after the measurement to be consistent with the results of the measurement) are considered. As such, only measurements that distinguish between valid epistemic states are allowed. For instance, we could measure whether the system is in states 1 or 2, 1 or 3, or 1 or 4, corresponding to 1 ‚à® 2, 1 ‚à® 3, and 1 ‚à® 4. Once the measurement has been done, one's state of knowledge about the system in question is updated; specifically, if one measured the system in the state 2 ‚à® 4, then the system would now be known to be in the ontic state 2 or the ontic state 4. Before a measurement is done on a system, it has a definite ontic state, in the case of an elementary system 1, 2, 3 or 4. If the initial ontic state of a system is 1, and one measured the state of the system with respect to the {1 ‚à® 3, 2 ‚à® 4} basis, then one would measure the state 1 ‚à® 3. Another measurement done in this basis would produce the same result. However, the underlying ontic state of the system can be changed by such a measurement, to either the state 1 or the state 3. This reflects the nature of measurement in quantum theory. Measurements done on a system in the toy model are non-commutative, as is the case for quantum measurements. This is due to the above fact, that a measurement can change the underlying ontic state of the system. For example, if one measures a system in the state 1 ‚à® 3 in the {1 ‚à® 3, 2 ‚à® 4} basis, then one obtains the state 1 ‚à® 3 with certainty. However, if one first measures the system in the {1 ‚à® 2, 3 ‚à® 4} basis, then in the {1 ‚à® 3, 2 ‚à® 4} basis, then the final state of the system is uncertain, prior to the measurement. The nature of measurements and of the coherent superposition in this theory also gives rise to the quantum phenomenon of interference. When two states are mixed by a coherent superposition, the result is a sampling of the ontic states from both, rather than the typical \\"and\\" or \\"or\\". This is one of the most important results of this model, as interference is often seen as evidence against the epistemic view. This model indicates that it can arise from a strictly epistemic system. ==Groups of elementary systems== A pair of elementary systems has 16 combined ontic states, corresponding to the combinations of the numbers 1 through 4 with 1 through 4 (i.e. the system can be in the state (1,1), (1,2), etc.). The epistemic state of the system is limited by the knowledge balance principle once again. Now however, not only does it restrict the knowledge of the system as a whole, but also of both of the constituent subsystems. Two types of systems of maximal knowledge arise as a result. The first of these corresponds to having maximal knowledge of both subsystems; for example, that the first subsystem is in the state 1 ‚à® 3 and the second is in the state 3 ‚à® 4, meaning that the system as a whole is in one of the states (1,3), (1,4), (3,3) or (3,4). In this case, nothing is known about the correspondence between the two systems. The second is more interesting, corresponding to having no knowledge about either system individually, but having maximal knowledge about their interaction. For example, one could know that the ontic state of the system is one of (1,1), (2,2), (3,4) or (4,3). Here nothing is known about the state of either individual system, but knowledge of one system gives knowledge of the other. This corresponds to the entangling of particles in quantum theory. It is possible to consider valid transformations on the states of a group of elementary systems, although the mathematics of such an analysis is more complicated than the case for a single system. Transformations consisting of a valid transformation on each state acting independently are always valid. In the case of a two-system model, there is also a transformation that is analogous to the c-not operator on qubits. Furthermore, within the bounds of the model it is possible to prove no-cloning and no-broadcasting theorems, reproducing a fair deal of the mechanics of quantum information theory. The monogamy of pure entanglement also has a strong analogue within the toy model, as a group of three or more systems in which knowledge of one system would grant knowledge of the others would break the knowledge balance principle. An analogy of quantum teleportation also exists in the model, as well as a number of important quantum phenomena. ==Extensions and further work== Work has been done on several models of physical systems with similar characteristics, which are described in detail in the main publication on this model. There are ongoing attempts to extend this model in various ways, such as van Enk's model. The toy model has also been analyzed from the viewpoint of categorical quantum mechanics. Currently, there is work being done to reproduce quantum formalism from information-theoretic axioms. Although the model itself differs in many respects from quantum theory, it reproduces a number of effects considered to be overwhelmingly quantum. As such, the underlying principle, that quantum states are states of incomplete knowledge, may offer some hints as to how to proceed in this manner and may lend hope to those pursuing this goal. ==See also== * Hidden variable theory * Interpretation of quantum mechanics ==References== Category:Hidden variable theory Category:Scientific modeling ","title":"Spekkens toy model"},{"id":"20206194","text":"KMEI may refer to: * KMEI-LP, a low-power radio station (97.3 FM) licensed to Kamiah, Idaho, United States * the ICAO code for Meridian Regional Airport, in Meridian, Mississippi, United States ","title":"KMEI"},{"id":"20206217","text":"Babaoshan is an atonal pinyin romanization of various Chinese places.

The National Historical Commission of the Philippines (, abbreviated NHCP) is a government agency of the Philippines. Its mission is \\"the promotion of Philippine history and cultural heritage through research, dissemination, conservation, sites management and heraldry works.\\" As such, it \\"aims to inculcate awareness and appreciation of the noble deeds and ideals of our heroes and other illustrious Filipinos, to instill pride in the Filipino people and to rekindle the Filipino spirit through the lessons of history.\\" ==History== The present day NHCP was established in 1972 as part of the reorganization of government after President Ferdinand Marcos' declaration of martial law, but the roots of the institute can be traced back to 1933, when the American colonial Insular Government first established the Philippine Historical Research and Markers Committee (PHRMC). ===Philippine Historical Research and Markers Committee (1933)=== The Philippine Historical Research and Markers Committee was created by U.S. Governor General Frank Murphy, by Executive Order 451, to identify and mark \\"historic antiquities\\" in Manila as a first step towards their preservation. Church of San Agustin, Fort Santiago, Plaza McKinley, Roman Catholic Cathedral of Manila, San Sebastian Church, Concordia College, Manila Railroad Company, Dr. Lorenzo Negrao, and University of Santo Tomas (Intramuros site) were among the first structures to be granted markers. The installation of markers were first limited to identify antiquities in Manila; however, the commission's mandate was later expanded to cover the whole of the Philippines. Many markers were destroyed or lost due to World War II, along with the structures they represent, and many have been replaced by post-war markers. This first committee was composed of American journalist Walter Robb who served as chair; American Anthropologist H. Otley Beyer who would later be known as the father of Philippine Anthropology; Spanish Jesuit Fr. Miguel Selga, SJ; dean Edward Hyde from the University of the Philippines College of Engineering; and Filipinos Jaime C. de Veyra, Conrado Benitez, and Eulogio ‚ÄúAmang‚Äù Rodriguez. ===Philippines Historical Committee (1935)=== With the establishment of the Philippine Commonwealth in 1935, the PHRMC was replaced by the Philippines Historical Committee (PHC), which took over the functions as its predecessor, as well as the tasks of repairing government-owned antiquities and acquiring antiquities owned by private individuals. While there are extant historical markers issued in 1941 (e.g. Magellan's Cross, Basilica del Santo Ni√±o, First shot of the Philippine- American War, Colegio de San Juan de Letran, & Malaca√±an Palace), there are no known records of the activities of the committee during the Japanese occupation of the Philippines during World War II, as the Committee closed in protest. In the postwar reconstruction years the PHC was busy as there was a government interest in \\"the reconstruction of the past as a means to form nationhood.\\" Reconstituted six months after Philippine independence in 1946, the committee was first placed under the Office of the President, and then transferred to the Department of Education. During this time, it installed over 400 historical markers all over the archipelago; named and renamed various streets, plazas, towns and other public places; and acquired places and relics of heroes. As the nation rebuilt itself, a number of other historical commissions were also created by law to commemorate the birth centennials of various Philippine heroes of the late 19th century. All of these commissions were eventually merged into one National Heroes Commission created in 1963. ===National Historical Commission (1965)=== In July 1965, Congress passed Republic Act No. 4368 that created the National Historical Commission (NHC) and effectively abolished the Philippine Historical Committee and the National Heroes Commission whose functions were delegated to the NHC. Among the functions of the NHC are the following: to publish or cause to have written or published the works of our national heroes and other great and good Filipinos; to compile from various sources here and abroad data on Philippine history and prepare and publish there from source books on Philippine history; to identify, designate and approximately mark historic places in the Philippines and to cause the construction or reconstruction and to maintain and care for national monuments, shrines and historic markers that have been erected; to take charge of all historical activities or projects not otherwise undertaken by any entity of the government; to gather data on historical dates, personages, events, and documents presented for evaluation, and to acquire through purchase, donation, exchange or otherwise, important historical documents and materials; and to encourage researches in Philippine history and the writing and publication of textbooks on the subject, the research and writing of biographies of heroes, accounts of historical events, translations of important scholarly works of Filipinos and foreigners by providing appropriate or adequate incentives. ===National Historical Institute (1972)=== In 1972, President Ferdinand Marcos' declaration of martial law resulted in a reorganization of government and the renaming of the NHC as the National Historical Institute. ===National Historical Commission of the Philippines (2010)=== On May 12, 2010, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo signed the law reverting the National Historical Institute into its original form as the National Historical Commission of the Philippines. ==Current activities== The NHCP still undertakes all the functions of the previous commissions, most notably those of preserving historical sites and structures and serving as lead agency for the commemorations of Independence Day and Rizal Day.

Without the funding to progress his career stalled at this point, taking him back to kart racing, picking up the Australian Reed Light Championship in 1994, and also into dirt-track Speedway, running Super Sedans. ==Touring Cars== An opportunity opened in 1997 for Hossack, driving the Wynns backed Holden Commodore in the 1997 Australian Touring Car Championship, and impressed in the midfield, snatching several top ten results during the season. For the final round he moved into a Gibson Motor Sport run Commodore, which continued into the endurance season where on his Bathurst debut, he and co-driver Steven Ellery finished in sixth position, the highest placed finish for any rookie in the race. 1998 saw a full-time drive in the Gibson Motor Sport team along with Wynns backed team mate Darren Pate, and Ellery also as team mate in a Holden Young Lions liviered Commodore. Hampered by Yokohama tyres, which were no match for Bridgestone and Dunlop shod teams, it was not a happy season and Hossack was replaced after the Barbagallo Raceway round by experienced veteran Tomas Mezera as the team struggled for pace. Hossack returned to the team for the endurance races and paired with Pate, took eighth place at the Sandown 500 and seventh at Bathurst. While a full-time V8 Supercar drive did not return, Hossack was a valued endurance co- driver for the next several seasons, driving for Romano Racing in 1999 and returning to Gibson Motor Sport in 2000 with a highlight of ninth position for GMS with David 'Truckie' Parsons at Bathurst in 2000. After a few seasons away from V8 Supercars, Hossack returned in 2003, driving a third Ford Performance Racing Falcon with Adam Macrow. ==Australian Champion== John Gourlay owned Audi A4 Sports SedanHossack became involved in John Gourlay's Sports Sedan team, driving a Chevrolet V8 powered Saab 900. He finished runner up to Tony Ricciardello in the 2002 Australian Sports Sedan Championship, and fourth in 2003 behind Kerry Baily, Dean Randle and Ricciardello, before claiming a hard fought win in the 2004 Tranzam Sports Sedan Series. After placing third in the 2005 series the team scaled down their efforts over the next few years having come to the end of the Saab's racing career (it was sold during the 2006 season to Mark Nelson) and construction began on a new race car. Again Chevrolet V8 powered, the Audi A4 made its debut in 2007, and quickly became a race winning car. In an epic finale to the 2008 season, with the pointscore tied heading into the final race Hossack beat 2007 series winner Ricciardello to win the race and the series by three points. The 2007 season saw Hossack begin racing Superkarts as well, racing the Anderson Maverick owned by Scott Ellis' Safe Evolutions team, which Ellis was using to prove his own engine design, the Safe Racing Engine, which was a modern re-interpretation of the 20-year-old Rotax 256 design. Promising results in the first season lead to his first race wins, first at state level in Victoria, then in front of a national field on the support program of the 2008 Eastern Creek round of the V8 Supercar Championship. Two race wins at the opening round of the Australian Superkart Championship also held at Eastern Creek Raceway set up a points buffer which was whittled away as the final round at Mallala Motor Sport Park progressed. With a slender points lead to protect, and title rivals Sam Zavaglia and Gary Pegoraro winning races almost lost the title. After almost stalling on the final race, Hossack raced back through the field, overtaking 25 karts over the eight lap finale to climb into third place on the final lap. With Zavaglia finishing second, it gave the title to Hossack by just three points. Hossack lost both titles in 2009, his rivalry with Tony Ricciardello saw category veteran Des Wall win the Sports Sedan series with a consistent run, and Sam Zavaglia took the Superkart title with a career best season. Hossack was third in Sports Sedans and second in Superkarts. 2010 saw a return to the title claiming his second Australian Championship in Superkarts after win in the final race of the series broke a tie with Warren McIlveen whose previously points leading Superkart limped to the line in third position. ==Career results== {  style=\\"font-size: 95%;\\" - !

The place to set the monument was chosen by the widow of Alexander I Elizabeth Alexeievna (Louise of Baden) ‚Äì opposite the Greek monastery. Most of the money to subsidize the construction of the monument was donated by the members of the Imperial house of Romanovs, the rest of the sum was raised by the people of Taganrog. The statue was sculpted by the eminent sculptor, rector of the St. Petersburg Academy of Arts Ivan Martos. The architectural part of the monument was designed by the famous architect Avraam Melnikov. The bronze figure of the emperor at full height was draped with a simple gown, and a general's uniform was visible under it. The tsar held the sword hilt with his left hand, and carried a scroll which was supposed to be the code of laws. One foot of Alexander I trampled a coiling snake symbolizing the victory over Napoleon. The face of the sculpture was a copy of the emperor's portrait, and the winged angels at his feet pointed out his angelic character. The granite pedestal consisted of three parts, 5 steps led to it. The entire monument weighed about 1600 kg. On October 23 (11), 1831, celebrations took place on the occasion of unveiling the monument. They included divine services, consecration of the monument, firing a salute, ringing bells at all the churches and evening illumination. In 1837 cast-iron lumps with heavy chains were added to palisade the monument. In 1888 a square was planted around and fenced with iron forged railings. In 1920 the monument was destroyed (in 1932 the statue was remelted). In 1998 in the course of celebrations of the tercentenary of Taganrog the monument was reconstructed according to original plans at the same place. The reconstruction was financed by the Rossiyskiy Kredit Bank. The original model of the monument is kept in the collection of Russian Museum in Saint Petersburg. ==Old and Modern Views== File:Alexander I Monument 1907.jpgMonument on a postcard of 1907.

It is defined as the absorbed dose multiplied by the area irradiated, expressed in gray-centimetres squared (Gy*cm2 - sometimes the prefixed units mGy*cm2 or cGy*cm2 are also used). Manufacturers of DAP meters usually calibrate them in terms of absorbed dose to air. DAP reflects not only the dose within the radiation field but also the area of tissue irradiated. Therefore, it may be a better indicator of the overall risk of inducing cancer than the dose within the field. It also has the advantages of being easily measured, with the permanent installation of a DAP meter on the X-ray set. Due to the divergence of a beam emitted from a \\"point source\\", the area irradiated (A) increases with the square of distance from the source (A ‚àù d2), while radiation intensity (I) decreases according to the inverse square of distance (I ‚àù 1/d2). Consequently, the product of intensity and area, and therefore DAP, is independent of distance from the source. ==How DAP is measured== An ionization chamber is placed beyond the X-ray collimators and must intercept the entire X-ray field for an accurate reading. Different parameters of the X-ray set, such as peak voltage (kVp), tube current (mA), exposure time, or the area of the field, can also be changed. For example, a 5 cm √ó 5 cm X-ray field with an entrance dose of 1 mGy will yield a 25 mGy*cm2 DAP value. When the field is increased to 10 cm √ó 10 cm with the same entrance dose, the DAP increases to 100 mGy*cm2, which is four times the previous value.http://www.orau.org/ptp/PTP%20Library/library/CRCPD/10-01_QA_DAP.pdf ==Kerma Area Product== Kerma area product (KAP) is a related quantity, which for all practical radiation protection purposes is equal to dose area product. However, strictly speaking \\\\mathrm{DAP} = \\\\mathrm{KAP} \\\\times (1-g), where g is the fraction of energy of liberated charged particles that is lost in radiative processes in the materialICRU Report 50, Fundamental Quantities and Units for Ionizing Radiation, International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements 1998 In Seltzer, Stephen M.

In the book, Pogge explains that the poorest 44 percent of humankind have 1.3 percent of global income and their purchasing power per person per day is less than that of $2.15 in the US in 1993; 826 million of them do not have enough to eat. One-third of all human deaths are from poverty-related causes: 18 million annually, including 12 million children under five.World Poverty and Human Rights: Cosmopolitan Responsibilities and Reforms At the other end of the spectrum, the 15 percent of humankind in the developed countries have 80 percent of global income. Pogge argues that shifting 1 or 2 percent of the wealthy states' share toward poverty eradication is morally compelling. Yet most of the affluent believe that they have no such responsibility and Thomas Pogge's book seeks to explain how this belief is sustained. He analyses how the \\"moral and economic theorizing and our global economic order\\" have adapted to make the wealthy states appear disconnected from mass poverty abroad. Dispelling the illusion, he also offers a normative standard of global economic justice and makes detailed, realistic proposals toward fulfilling it.Thomas Pogge: World Poverty and Human Rights == Eradicate Poverty == Thomas Pogge argues that with the cost of two-thirds of the US military's expenditures, wealthy states could largely eradicate poverty.Thomas Pogge on Global Poverty The global rich have a duty to eradicate poverty because they have violated the principal of justice to not unduly harm others by their coercive global order.Ethical Theory and Moral PracticeVol. 7, No. 5 (January 2005), pp. 537-550 ==References== Category:2002 books Category:British non-fiction books Category:Books about poverty Category:Books about globalization ","title":"World Poverty and Human Rights"},{"id":"20206426","text":"Buena Vista is a small town in the Bolivian lowlands in the Santa Cruz Department.

The established studies by several historians associated this kingdom with Srivijaya and thought its location was somewhere in Sumatra, Java or Malay Peninsula. Indonesian historian suggested that Zabag is connected to the present day Muara Sabak area, the estuarine of Batang Hari River in East Tanjung Jabung Regency, Jambi province. Zabag may also located in Java, not Srivijaya because Zabag is noted to annex Srivijaya, and the size of Zabag is only half the size of an island called Ramni (Sumatra). However, its exact location is still the subject of debate among scholars. Other possible locations such as northern Borneo and Philippines are also suggested.The Medieval Geography of Sanfotsi and Zabag ==Historical sources== The main source of the existence of the kingdom of Zabag was revealed by a Persian sailor named Sulaiman al-Tajir al-Sirafi, known as Sulaiman the Merchant, in his book \\"Rihlah As-Sirafiy\\" (As-Sirafi's journey) recorded his journey to India, China, and the Zabaj islands in the period 851 AD. Following are excerpts of Sulaiman al-Tajir al-Sirafi's journey: > Then we will discuss the city of Zabaj, which separates [Arab] from China. > Between the two [Zabaj and China] can be reached by sea travel for a month, > or less if the wind is good; it is said to be around 900 farsakh.

(\\"Rihlah As-Sirafiy\\", Sulaiman al-Tajir al- > Sirafi) Many scholars identify Srivijaya empire with the Arabic Zabaj, which most scholars agree in equating it with Javaka (in Pali texts), that also appeared in Indian sources. According to a Sri Lankan source, king Chandrabhanu Sridhamaraja is one of Javakan kings from Tambralinga kingdom, who had invaded Sri Lanka in 1247. However, the term Javaka was not occurred here for the first time, the term has been used vaguely to identify a polity in Southeast Asia. The naval prowess of the Maharaja of Zabaj had played a major role in forming a legend recorded by Sulaimaan, an Arabic merchant in 851, and published by Masoudi, a historian, in his 947 book \\"Meadows of Gold and Mines of Gems.\\" He described the story of one proud Khmer king who foolishly defied the power of the Maharaja of Zabaj. Some scholars have sought to link this Maharaja of Zabaj with the Sailendra king of Java. However, there are few evidences to prove that the Maharaja of Zabaj is the same king of Sailendra. While the Javakan king of Tambralinga had been directly linked to Maharaja of Zabaj. Therefore, the Javaka had occurred in The history since 9th century. In addition, Javakan king also occurred in the history of Lavo kingdom. ===Legend of the Maharaja of Zabaj=== One day in a fit of jealousy, the Khmer ruler made the following remark in court. \\"I have one desire that I would like to satisfy,\\" said the young ruler. \\"What is that desire, O King,\\" inquired his faithful councillor. \\"I wish to see before me on a plate,\\" remarked the monarch, \\"the head of the King of Zabaj.\\" \\"I do not wish, O King, that my sovereign should express such a desire,‚Äù answered the minister. ‚ÄúThe Khmer and Zabaj have never manifested hatred towards each other, either in words or in acts. Zabaj has never done us any harm. What the King has said should not be repeated.\\" Angered by this sage advice, the Khmer ruler raised his voice and repeated his desire so that all of the generals and nobles who were present at court could hear him. Word of the young ruler‚Äôs impetuous outburst passed from mouth to mouth until it finally arrived at the court of the Maharaja of Zabaj. Upon hearing the words of the Khmer ruler, the Maharaja ordered his councillor to prepare a thousand ships for departure. When the fleet was ready, the Maharaja himself went aboard and announced to the crowd on shore that he would be making a pleasure trip amongst his islands. Once at sea, however, the Maharaja orders the armada to proceed to the capital of the Khmer ruler, where his troops took the Khmers by surprise, seized the city, and surrounded the palace. After the Khmer ruler had been captured, he was brought before the Maharaja of Zabaj. \\"What caused you to form a desire which was not in your power to satisfy, which would not have given you happiness if you had realized it, and would not even have been justified if it had been easily realizable?\\" inquired the Maharaja of Zabaj. Since the Khmer king had nothing to say in return, the Maharaja of Zabaj continued. \\"You have manifested the desire to see before you my head on a plate. If you also had wished to seize my country and my kingdom or even only to ravage a part of it, I would have done the same to you. But since you have only expressed the first of these desires, I am going to apply to you the treatment you wished to apply to me, and I will then return to my country without taking anything belonging to the Khmer, either of great or small value.\\" When the Maharaja returned to his own palace back home, he seated himself on the throne. Set before him was a plate upon which rested the head of the former Khmer king. === Sayabiga === Numerous Arabic sources noted the existence of a people called Sayabiga, which are already settled on the shores of the Persian Gulf before the rise of Islam. This tribe or group appears to have been derived from a colony of Sumatran or Javanese people, originally settled in Sind, but who were eventually made prisoners during a Persian invasion and forcibly enrolled in the Persian military forces. Sayabiga were mercenaries of high soldierly qualities, disciplined, used to the sea, faithful servants; and in consequence, they were considered eminently suitable to serve as guards and soldiers, gaolers, and wardens of the treasury. In the reign of Caliph Abu Bakr (632-634) they formed a garrison at At-Khatt, in Al-Bahrain, and in 656 they a-re recorded as having been entrusted with the guarding of the treasury at Al-Basra.Sayabiga, by G. Ferrand, in the Encyclopcedia of Islam, London and Leyden, 1926. Ferrand (1926) shows that the name Sayabiga is derived directly from Sabag, which is a variation of Zabag. ==LocationSrivijaya=== Many historian identify Zabag with Srivijaya, a maritime empire centered in Sumatra. Zabag is the Arabic word for Sumatra and Java, roughly corresponding with the Srivijaya Empire. A French scholar George Coed√®s published his discoveries and interpretations in Dutch and Indonesian-language newspapers. Coed√®s noted that the Chinese references to \\"Sanfoqi\\" or \\"Sanfotsi\\", previously read as \\"Sribhoja\\", and the inscriptions in Old Malay refer to the same empire. This contradicts the opinion of Mulyana and Lombard, who identified Sanfotsi and Sanfoqi as Srivijaya / Sumatra, in contrast to Java. Srivijaya and by extension Sumatra had been known by different names to different peoples. The Chinese called it Sanfotsi, and at one time there was an even older kingdom of Kantoli that could be considered as the predecessor of Srivijaya. In Sanskrit and Pali, it was referred to as Yavadesh and Javadeh respectively. The Arabs called it Zabag and the Khmer called it Melayu. This is another reason why the discovery of Srivijaya was so difficult. While some of these names are strongly reminiscent of the name of Java, there is a distinct possibility that they may have referred to Sumatra instead. === Java === Sulayman around 851 AD noted that Sribuza (Srivijaya) and Kalah (a place on the Malay peninsula, possibly Kedah) were the area ruled by Zabag. Therefore, the intended Zabag is not Srivijaya. Ibn Khordazbeh in 844, Ibn Al-Fakih in 902, Abu Zayd Hasan in 943, and Sulayman in 851 AD noted that Zabag united Sribuza and Kalah. From other Arabic information, the kingdom of Zabag is as far as 20 days of voyage from the Kalah. According to Abu'lfida' information, the distance between Kalah and the central state of Java was 20 days of journey. The distance is the same as the distance from Malacca to Majapahit as recorded by The Epic of Hang Tuah.Hikayat Hang Tuah, VI: 122. \\"Maka Titah Seri Betara, \\"Berapa lama-nya anak-ku datang ini di-laut?\\" Maka sembah Raja Malaka, \\"Patek ini empat puloh hari di-laut, banyak patek singgah. Jika patek berlayar sungguh-sungguh, dua puloh hari sampai-lah.\\" According to Nugroho, these information shows that Zabag is Java, not Sumatra or the Malay peninsula. He also noted several important points: Sulayman mentioned that Zabaj is only half the length of Al- Rami island, which indicates that Zabaj is Java while Al-Rami is Sumatra. The island which Maharaja reside, is very fertile and densely populated, which corresponds to Java. It is also possible that She-p√≥ or She-b√≥ in Chinese records, which is the original name of the island of Java (Javadvipa is the Sanskrit word for the island), is Zabag. When John of Marignolli returned from China to Avignon, he stayed at the Kingdom of Saba for a few months, which he said had many elephants and was led by a queen; Saba may be his interpretation of She-b√≥.Yule, Sir Henry (1913). Cathay and the way thither: being a collection of medieval notices of China vol. II. London: The Hakluyt Society.

The word \\"Saba\\" comes from Kawi Javanese language word Saba which means \\"meeting\\" or \\"assembly\\". Thus the name can be interpreted as \\"meeting place\\".

At the same time, he worked on a freelance base, among other things for the local stations RTV Oost, Omroep Gelderland, and Radio 1. He also wrote for several Dutch magazines: Nieuwe Revu, Kijk, and Voetbal International. Two years later, a radio documentary by Lassche about the everyday life on a village of farmers was awarded with the second prize at RVU-Radioprijs. Lassche has been working for the Evangelische Omroep since 2000 for several programs. He reconstructed an attempt at kidnapping Juliana of the Netherlands by South Moluccan radicals and to occupy the Soestdijk Palace. This plot, to be executed in April 1975, was prevented as the General Intelligence and Security Service (BVD) was tipped at the last moment. Etienne Urka, who was befriended with South Moluccans then, confessed to Lassche that he informed the BVD about the RMS plot while in prison. Lassche became renowned for his report about the 'Forgotten Poles during the Battle for Arnhem', for which he took the last journalistic television-interview with prince Bernhard. Following this documentary, Queen Beatrix honored the 1st Independent Polish Parachute Brigade with the Military Order of William on May 31, 2006. The commander of the Brigade, the late Major General Stanis≈Çaw Sosabowski, was awarded the \\"Bronze Lion\\" posthumously. The gratitude for this retribution was so great in Poland that Lassche himself was also decorated. On January 30, 2007, he was awarded a military decoration and the civil Golden Cross of Merit. During the ceremony, a grandson of Major General Sosabowski was present. In 2005 Lassche made a series of reports about the Netherlands's Foreign Law. It was discovered that civil servants of the Immigration and Naturalisation Services had informed the Congolese embassy and authorities that several of the people sent back to the Democratic Republic of Congo had claimed asylum in the Netherlands. This information is considered confidential and should not have been disclosed to the Congolese authorities. Rita Verdonk, then Minister of Immigration, at first denied any wrongdoing on behalf of herself or her civil servants, but later admitted that in several cases the Congolese embassy had been informed that returnees were former applicants for asylum in the Netherlands. For these reports, Lassche got the Gouden Tape, an incentive prize for young journalism television talent. Lassche's historical documentary t Was maar een mof ('He was just a jerry') revealed the story of the German Wehrmacht soldier Karl-Heinz Rosch during the occupation of the Netherlands in the Second World War, who rescued two Dutch toddlers but was killed himself. This story became well-known nationally and resulted in the dedication of a statue for Rosch.

The order contains around 1500 species, while the largest order with lichenized fungi, the Lecanorales, contains more than 14000 species. == Classification == The Arthoniales is the only order of the class Arthoniomycetes within the phylum Ascomycota. The order includes seven families (Andreiomycetacae, Arthoniaceae, Chrysotrichaceae, Lecanographaceae, Opegraphaceae, Roccellaceae and Roccellographaceae). Lecanographaceae, Roccellographaceae, Opegraphaceae and Roccellaceae are well- supported families within Arthoniales, and they were circumscribed in 2011. Andreiomycetaceae was described as a new family by Hodkinson and Lendemer in 2013. The Arthoniales is the sister group to Dothideomycetes. Figure 1. Cladogram of the Arthoniales, rooted with Curvularia brachyspora, Cudonia circinans and Seynesia erumpens as the outgroup. The cladogram shows the division of Arthoniales into seven families, based on Hodkinson et al. 2013. == Distribution and habitats == The Arthoniales is distributed in most habitats worldwide, as it ranges at latitudes from arctic to tropical regions. They grow on different types of substrates like bark, wood, rocks, bryophytes and living leaves. The order has adapted to live in both humid forests and dry habitats like savannas and steppes, as well as varying altitudes from sea level to alpine regions. The highest species diversity are known from subtropical coastal areas with a Mediterranean or dry climate. The species diversity of the Arthoniales is expected to be higher than currently reported from several areas worldwide like the tropical rain forests. == Ecology == The majority of species in Arthoniales have a lichenized lifestyle, but lichenicolous and saprophytic species are presented as well. The original state in the Arthoniales is believed to be the lichenized state, and the non- lichenized and parasitic states have evolved independently several times. The lichenized fungi live in symbiosis with a photobiont that in most cases is a species of Trentepohliaceae, but photobionts from Chlorococcaleae are known from Chrysotrichaceae and a few species in Arthonia. == Characters == It is difficult to mention typical morphological characters like fruit body, exiple, hypothecium, hymenium, chemistry, ascospore color and ascospore septation that can be used as uniting traits for delimiting families and genera in the Arthoniales. The reason is that the Arthoniales is an old order and taxa have evolved in parallel for a long time, which gives a high level of homoplasy. === Ascomatal anatomy === The ascomata are usually apothecial and it produces bitunicate asci. The bitunicate asci are thick-walled, with an outer and inner layer. The outer and inner layer of the ascus wall are called exotunica and endotunica, and they separate during ascospore release. The asci usually contains eight ascospores, while the shape and separation of the ascospores are more variating. === Thallus === The majority of the species in Arthoniales are crustose lichens, with a thallus growing tight to the surface. Fruticose lichens have a bushy thallus and are known in Roccellaceae, where it has evolved and been lost multiple times. The thalli among crustose lichens can either grow within the substrate, called endophloedal or it can grow at the surface of the substrate, called epiphloedal. == Genera incertae sedis == The following genera within the Arthoniales have not been placed with any certainty into a family. *Angiactis *Arthophacopsis *Bactrospora *Catarraphia *Glyphopsis *Gossypiothallon *Helminthocarpon *Hormosphaeria *Minksia *Nipholepis *Perigrapha *Phoebus *Sporostigma *Synarthonia *Synarthothelium *Tarbertia *Tremotylium *Trichophyma *Tylophorella *Wegea == References == Category:Arthoniomycetes Category:Lichens Category:Ascomycota orders ","title":"Arthoniales"},{"id":"20206516","text":"Terms such as Serbian Volunteers, Serbian Volunteer Corps, Serbian Volunteer Division, Serbian Volunteer Force, Serbian Volunteer Guard, Serbian Volunteer Military, et cetera may refer to: *Serbian Militia, a militia formed to fight the Ottoman Empire during the Great Turkish War *Serbian Militia (1718‚Äì39), a militia formed to fight the Ottoman Empire during the Austro-Turkish War *Serbian Free Corps, a militia formed to fight the Ottoman Empire in the 18th century, also known by the shortened name \\"Free Corps\\" *First Serbian Volunteer Division, a World War I era military organization created in Odessa, also known by the names \\"First Serbian Division\\" and \\"Serbian First Division\\" *Serbian Volunteer Corps (World War II), a formation of Nazi collaborators that began in 1941, also known by the acronym \\"SDK\\" and the name \\"Serbian Volunteer Command\\" *Serb Volunteer Guard, a paramilitary unit active in the 1990s, also known by the acronym \\"SDG\\" and the names \\"Serbian Volunteer Guard\\" and \\"Arkan's Tigers\\" ==See also== *Chetniks, a disorganized set of militant groups associated with both World Wars and later conflicts *List of Serbian paramilitary formations *Yugoslav Partisans, anti-Nazi forces including Serbs among other ethnicities ","title":"Serbian Volunteers"},{"id":"20206527","text":"Erich Hauser Erich Hauser (15 December 1930, Rietheim - 28 March 2004, Rottweil) was a German sculptor. == Life == From 1945 to 1948 Erich Hauser was apprenticed to a steel engraver. Moreover, he was taught drawing and modelling by Father Ansgar at the Beuron Archabbey. Afterwards he studied at the Freie Kunstschule in Stuttgart taking evening classes in sculpting. Sculpture by Erich Hauser in Kassel, 1972/73 Since 1952 Hauser worked as a free artist and sculptor. His first influences were the sculptures of the Spanish artist Pablo Picasso and the Italian-French artist Berto Lardera. In dealing with metal he was influenced by contemporary informel painters of the 1950s. At first his steel sculptures still showed noticeable marks of processing. Later he opted for smooth surfaces. Since 1962 he worked with industrially pre-fabricated steel plates. At the same time he dealt with basic geometrical structures and technical structural elements, which were characteristic of Hauser‚Äôs first autonomous works. He transformed composed surfaces into hollow sculptures to be viewed from all sides, showing edgy burrs and caves. The sculptures cannot be walked-on. Hauser assembled the metal elements in such a way that they finally became regular hollow bodies. Thus he created spheres, cubes and tetrahedrons. It is significant of these works that they seem likely to break or fall to pieces or be in risky balance. Hauser‚Äôs participation in the documenta III (1964), documenta 4 (1968) and documenta 6 (1977) in Kassel brought about his artistic breakthrough. From 1964 to 1965 Hauser was a guest lecturer at the school of visual arts in Hamburg. Since then he frequently used pillars as subjects and discovered spatial height.

With its coastal and riverine forests, its huge fresh water lakes, mountains and deserts, Sindh supports a large and varied wildlife population, this area is unique in the fact that it is the location of the world's only fertile desert on the planet. ==Habitat and wildlife== Due to the climate of Sindh, its forests support average population of jackals and snakes. The national parks established by the Government of Pakistan, in collaboration with organizations such as World Wide Fund for Nature and the Sindh Wildlife Department helps preserve a huge variety of animals and birds. The Kirthar National Park in the Kirthar range spreads out over more than 3000 km2 of desert, stunted tree forests and a lake. The KNP supports Sindh ibex, wild sheep (urial) and the black bear along with the rare leopard. There are also occasional sightings of The Sindhi phekari, ped lynx or caracal cat. There is now also a project to introduce tigers and asian elephants to KNP near the Hub dam lake. Black bears Rani Kot, a fort in the Kirthar range. Caracal ==Nara Canal region== Another biodiversity rich area of Sindh is the huge plains around the Nara Canal. The Nara Canal juts out of the Indus River from the Sukkur Barrage and irrigates hundreds of thousands of acres of cultivated land. The Nara Canal also provides vital water for species living in its proximity and also to its lakes. The famous Indus river dolphin is among the most endangered species in Pakistan and is found in the Northern Sindh's Indus River area and the upper reaches of the Nara Canal. Pharo (hog deer) and wild bear are found in the area of the central inundation belt. There are a variety of bats, lizards and reptiles: including the cobra, lundi (viper).

It is designed to quickly inform the public of various threats and emergencies such as earthquakes, severe weather and other danger. The system was developed in the hope that early warnings would speed up evacuation times and help coordinate emergency response. ==System== J-Alert is a satellite based system that allows authorities to quickly broadcast alerts to local media and to citizens directly via a system of nationwide loudspeakers, television, radio, email and cell broadcasts. According to Japanese officials, it takes about 1 second to inform local officials, and between 4 and 20 seconds to relay the message to citizens. An enhanced version of the J-Alert receivers were installed by the end of March 2019. The new models can automatically process the information within 2 seconds, compared to the older models that can take up to 20 seconds. All warnings, except for severe weather warnings, are broadcast in five languages: Japanese, English, Mandarin, Korean and Portuguese (Japan has a small Chinese, Korean and Brazilian population, as well as British, American and other English-speaking populations). The warnings were broadcast in these languages during the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami.Tsunami Warning in multiple languages. The severe weather warnings are only broadcast in Japanese. J-Alert broadcasts via both ground systems and the Superbird-B2 communication satellite. When there is a civil emergency such as a ballistic missile heading towards Japan, a special air raid siren sounds across loudspeakers and on TV and radio. When the siren starts, if it ends when the square waves hit at 329 kHz and 203 kHz, that means that a civil emergency is in effect. If the square waves reach 261 kHz and 283 kHz, that means the missile has passed. ==Information transmission capabilities== North Korean missile launch over Japan *Earthquake **Earthquake Early Warning **Quick updates on hypocenter, magnitude, and precautions of possible tsunami **Information of hypocenter, magnitude, intensities of various areas, and the presence of tsunami **Earthquake prediction warning for the T≈çkai earthquakes **Earthquake prediction advisory information of the T≈çkai earthquakes **Earthquake prediction information of the Tokai earthquakes *Tsunami **Major tsunami warning **Tsunami warning **Tsunami advisory *Volcano eruption **Emergency warning of volcanic eruption and the possibility of eruption **Warning of volcanic eruption and the possibility of eruption **Volcanic crater forecast *Severe weather **Emergency warnings for heavy rain, heavy snow, gale, snowstorm, waves, and storm surge **Warnings for heavy rain, heavy snow, gale, snowstorm, waves, and storm surge **Weather advisory **Information of the risk of landslides **Advisory information for tornado **Information of violent heavy rain **Flood forecast *Special emergency threats **Information of ballistic missiles **Information of airstrikes **Information of guerrilla and special forces attacks **Information of large-scale terrorism **Other information for civil and national defense ==Adoption rate== Many prefectures and urban areas were slow in adopting the system. Upon its introduction, the Japanese government hoped to have 80% of the country equipped with the J-Alert system by 2009. However, by 2011, only 36% of the nation had been covered. Cost had been a major factor; the initial installation is estimated to be around 430 million yen, and the yearly maintenance is estimated to be around 10 million yen. By May 2013, 99.6% of municipalities nationwide were covered. ==See also== *Emergency population warning *Emergency Warning Broadcast system ==References * J-Alert Overview Fire and Disaster Management Agency, Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications * ÂõΩÊ∞ë‰øùË≠∑ÂÆ§„ÉªÂõΩÊ∞ë‰øùË≠∑ÈÅãÁî®ÂÆ§ Fire and Disaster Management Agency, Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications * ÂåóÊúùÈÆÆ„Åã„ÇâÁô∫Â∞Ñ„Åï„Çå„ÅüÂºæÈÅì„Éü„Çµ„Ç§„É´„ÅåÊó•Êú¨„Å´È£õÊù•„Åô„ÇãÂèØËÉΩÊÄß„Åå„ÅÇ„ÇãÂ†¥Âêà„Å´„Åä„Åë„ÇãÂÖ®ÂõΩÁû¨ÊôÇË≠¶Â†±„Ç∑„Çπ„ÉÜ„É†ÔºàÔº™„Ç¢„É©„Éº„ÉàÔºâ„Å´„Çà„ÇãÊÉÖÂ†±‰ºùÈÅî„Å´„Å§„ÅÑ„Å¶ Cabinet Secretariat Civil Protection * ÂÖ®ÂõΩÁû¨ÊôÇË≠¶Â†±„Ç∑„Çπ„ÉÜ„É†ÔºàJ-ALERTÔºâ„ÅÆÊï¥ÂÇô Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications * Guide on disaster prevention and mitigation effort during earthquakes and tsunamis Japan Meteorological Agency * Protecting guide against Armed Attacks or Terrorism Cabinet Secretariat Civil Protection * J-Alert message relayed during the 2011 Tohoku earthquake, warning of an imminent tsunami * ÂÖ®ÂõΩÁû¨ÊôÇË≠¶Â†±„Ç∑„Çπ„ÉÜ„É† ÂÆüÈöõ„ÅÆÊîæÈÄÅ‰æã (J-Alert Demonstration) YouTube Category:Emergency management in Japan Category:Emergency population warning systems ","title":"J-Alert"},{"id":"20206664","text":"La Salette of Roxas College. is a Marian Institution school located in Vira, Roxas, Isabela, Philippines.

They have been poorly understood for a long time and its taxonomic position has been unclear because of lacking molecular data,. The family was previously included in Arthoniales of the class Arthoniomycetes but recent phylogenetic analyses supports it to belong in Eremithallales of the class Dothideomycetes. The Eremithallales was described as a new order in 2008, and Eremithallus costaricensis was included as the only species. The phylogenetic results placing Melaspileaceae in Eremithallales are corresponding with the morphology as the only genus in Eremithallales are sharing morphological similarities with Melaspilea, which is the type genus of Melaspileaceae. They are both being lichenized with a trentepohlioid photobiont and they share similarities in ascomata, exciple, hamathecium, ascus and ascospore types.

In addition to its carcinogenicity, aristolochic acid is also highly nephrotoxic and may be a causative agent in Balkan nephropathy. However, despite these well-documented dangers, aristolochic acid still is present sometimes in herbal remedies (such as for weight loss), primarily because of substitution of innocuous herbs with Aristolochia species.

The funding for this project was provided by the Inland Waterways Association, the East Riding of Yorkshire Council, and Waste Recycling Environmental Limited (WREN), who give grants to organisations based near to landfill sites. == See also == *Driffield Navigation *Canal lock == References  Category:Buildings and structures in the East Riding of Yorkshire Category:Transport in the East Riding of Yorkshire Category:Locks on the Driffield Navigation Category:Grade II listed buildings in the East Riding of Yorkshire ","title":"Wansford Lock"},{"id":"20206758","text":"Mirko Plantiƒá (born 15 January 1985) is a Croatian footballer. ==External links== *Profile at 1hnl.net *National team stats at Croatian Football Federation website Category:1985 births Category:Living people Category:Croatian footballers Category:Croatia under-21 international footballers Category:Croatia youth international footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:Croatian First Football League players Category:Slovak Super Liga players Category:Albanian Superliga players Category:NK Vara≈ædin players Category:NK Kri≈æevci players Category:FC Chornomorets Odesa players Category:FC DAC 1904 Dunajsk√° Streda players Category:KF Vllaznia Shkod√´r players Category:NK Meƒëimurje players Category:NK Croatia Sesvete players Category:NK Istra 1961 players Category:Croatian expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Ukraine Category:Croatian expatriate sportspeople in Ukraine Category:Expatriate footballers in Slovakia Category:Croatian expatriate sportspeople in Slovakia Category:Expatriate footballers in Albania Category:Croatian expatriate sportspeople in Albania Category:Expatriate footballers in Austria Category:Croatian expatriate sportspeople in Austria Category:Expatriate footballers in Switzerland Category:Croatian expatriate sportspeople in Switzerland Category:Expatriate footballers in Germany Category:Croatian expatriate sportspeople in Germany ","title":"Mirko Plantiƒá"},{"id":"20206762","text":"The angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), also called angiotensin (AT1) receptor antagonists or sartans, are a group of antihypertensive drugs that act by blocking the effects of the hormone angiotensin II (Ang II) in the body, thereby lowering blood pressure. Their structure is similar to Ang II and they bind to Ang II receptors as inhibitors, e.g., [T24 from Rhys Healthcare]. ARBs are widely used drugs in the clinical setting today, their main indications being mild to moderate hypertension, chronic heart failure, secondary stroke prevention and diabetic nephropathy. The discovery and development of ARBs is a demonstrative example of modern rational drug design and how design can be used to gain further knowledge of physiological systems, in this case, the characterization of the subtypes of Ang II receptors. ==History== In 1898, the physiologist Robert Tigerstedt and his student, Per Bergman, experimented with rabbits by injecting them with kidney extracts. Their results suggested the kidneys produced a protein, which they named renin, that caused a rise in blood pressure. In the 1930s, Goldblatt conducted experiments where he constricted the renal blood flow in dogs; he found the ischaemic kidneys did in fact secrete a chemical that caused vasoconstriction. In 1939, renin was found not to cause the rise in blood pressure, but was an enzyme which catalyzed the formation of the substances that were responsible, namely, angiotensin I (Ang I) and Ang II. In the 1970s, scientists first observed Ang II to harm the heart and kidneys, and individuals with high levels of renin activity in plasma were at increased risk of myocardial infarction and stroke. With the introduction of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in the late 1970s it was confirmed that Ang II plays an important role in regulating blood pressure and electrolyte and fluid balance. Before that attempts had been made to develop useful Ang II receptor antagonists and initially, the main focus was on angiotensin peptide analogues. Saralasin and other Ang II analogues were potent Ang II receptor blockers but the main problem was a lack of oral bioavailability. In the early 1980s it was noted that a series of imidazole-5-acetic acid derivatives diminished blood pressure responses to Ang II in rats. Two compounds, S-8307 and S-8308, were later found to be highly specific and promising non-peptide Ang II receptor antagonists but using molecular modeling it was seen that their structures would have to mimic more closely the pharmacophore of Ang II. Structural modifications were made and the orally active, potent and selective nonpeptide AT1 receptor blocker losartan was developed. In 1995 losartan was approved for clinical use in the United States and since then six additional ARBs have been approved. These drugs are known for their excellent side- effects profiles, which clinical trials have shown to be similar to those of placebos.Analogue-based Drug Discovery (Optimizing Antihypertensive Therapy by Angiotensin Receptor Blockers; Farsang, C., Fisher, J., p.157-167) Editors; Fischer, J., Ganellin, R. Wiley-VCH 2006. ==The angiotensin II receptor== The actions of Ang II are mediated by angiotensin receptors, AT1 and AT2. These receptors are members of the G protein-coupled receptors family which are seven transmembrane helices, connected by interchanging extracellular and intracellular loops. Each G protein-coupled receptor couples to a specific G-protein which leads to activation of a special effector system. AT1 receptors are for instance primarily coupled through the Gq/11 group of G-proteins. Two more angiotensin receptors have been described, AT3 and AT4, but their role is still unknown. ===Distribution in the body=== AT1 receptors are mainly found in the heart, adrenal glands, brain, liver and kidneys. Their main role is to regulate blood pressure as well as fluid and electrolyte balance. AT2 receptors are highly expressed in the developing fetus but they decline rapidly after birth. In the adult, AT2 receptors are present only at low levels and are mostly found in the heart, adrenal glands, uterus, ovaries, kidneys and brain. ===Functions=== Most of the known actions of Ang II are mediated through the AT1 receptors, for example vasoconstriction, aldosterone release, renal sodium reabsorption and vasopressin secretion. The AT2 receptor also takes part in regulation of blood pressure and renal function but mediates antagonistic effects compared to the AT1 receptor. ===Binding pockets=== Fig 1. Losartan receptor binding Ang II binds to AT1 receptors via various binding sites. The primary binding site is at the extracellular region of the AT1 receptor where Ang II interacts with residues in the N-terminus of the AT1 receptor and its first and third extracellular loops. The transmembrane helices also contribute to the binding via the C-terminal carboxyl group that interacts with Lys199 in the upper part of helix 5 of the receptor; see figure 1 for details. The ionic bridge formed between Lys199 and the carboxyl terminal group of the Phe8 residue of Ang II is most likely stabilized by the Trp253 residue. In addition, Phe259 and Asp263 in transmembrane helix 6 and Lys102 and Ser105 in the outer region of transmembrane helix 3 have also been implicated in Ang II binding. This region may possibly participate in the stabilization of the receptor's ratification and in the formation of the intramembrane binding pocket. ==Mechanism of action== Fig 2. Renin angiotensin pathway Blood pressure and fluid and electrolyte homeostasis is regulated by the renin‚Äìangiotensin‚Äìaldosterone system. Renin, an enzyme released from the kidneys, converts the inactive plasma protein angiotensinogen into angiotensin I (Ang I). Then Ang I is converted to Ang II with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), see figure 2. Ang II in plasma then binds to AT- receptors.Goodman & Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics 11th ed. (Renin and Angiotensin; Jackson E.K., 789-821) Editors; Brunton L.L., Lazo J.S., Parker K.L. New York McGraw Hill 2006. ARBs are blocking the last part of the renin‚Äìangiotensin pathway and block the pathway more specifically than ACE inhibitors. The AT1 receptor mediates Ang II to cause increased cardiac contractility, sodium reabsorption and vasoconstriction which all lead to increased blood pressure. By blocking AT1 receptors, ARBs lead to lower blood pressure. An insurmountable inhibition of the AT1 receptor is achieved when the maximum response of Ang II cannot be restored in the presence of the ARB, no matter how high the concentration of Ang II is. The angiotensin receptor blockers can inhibit the receptor in a competitive surmountable, competitive insurmountable or noncompetitive fashion, depending upon the rate at which they dissociate from the receptor. ==Drug discovery and development== Fig 3. Drug development of ARB ===Development from saralasin to losartan and eprosartan=== For a simple overview of the development of ARBs, see figure 3. Because of saralasin, the first Ang II antagonist, and the development of the first ACE inhibitor captopril, it was generally acknowledged that Ang II receptor antagonists might be promising as effective antihypertensive agents. Saralasin was developed in the early 1970s and is an octapeptide analogue of Ang II, where the amino acids Asp1, Ile5 and Phe8 have been replaced with Ser1, Val5 and Ala8, respectively. Saralasin was not orally bioavailable, had short duration of action and showed partial agonist activity and therefore it was not suitable as a drug. Thus the goal was to develop a smaller nonpeptide substance with similar inhibition and binding features. At this time, a group at DuPont had already started the screening of nonpeptide mimics of Ang II using existing substances from chemical libraries. Research investigators at Takeda discovered in 1982 the weak nonpeptide Ang II antagonists S-8307 and S-8308 from a group of 1-benzylimidazole-5-acetic acid derivatives. S-8307 and S-8308 have moderate potency, short duration of action and limited oral bioavailability, however they are selective and competitive AT1 receptor antagonists without partial agonist activity. A group at DuPont postulated that both Ang II and the Takeda leads were bound at the same receptor site. These two substances served as lead compounds for further optimization of AT1 receptor blockers. Using nuclear magnetic resonance studies on the spatial structure of Ang II, scientists at DuPont discovered that the Takeda structures had to be enlarged at a particular position to resemble more closely the much larger peptide Ang II. Computer modeling was used to compare S-8308 and S-8307 with Ang II and it was seen that Ang II contains two acidic residues near the NH2 terminus. These groups were not mimicked by the Takeda leads and therefore it was hypothesized that acidic functional groups would have to be added to the compounds. The 4-carboxy-derivative EXP-6155 had a binding activity which was ten-fold greater than that of S-8308 which further strengthened this hypothesis. By replacing the 4-carboxy-group with a 2-carboxy-benzamido-moiety the compound EXP-6803 was synthesized. It had highly increased binding affinity but was only active when administered intravenously. Replacing the 2-carboxy- benzamido-group with a 2-carboxy-phenyl-group created the lipophilic biphenyl- containing EXP-7711, which exhibited good oral activity but slightly less affinity for the AT1 receptor. Then the polar carboxyl group was replaced with a more lipophilic tetrazole group in order to increase oral bioavailability and duration of action further and the compound thus formed was named losartan. This development took place in 1986 and losartan became the first successful Ang II antagonist drug, approved as such in the United States in 1995 and was marketed by Merck. This development was an extensive program and it is estimated that the process from the Takeda structures to the final substance, losartan, took more than fifty person-years of work in biological testing and chemical modifications. This represents an excellent investment given that a recent study estimated that losartan administration in the European union may reduce health care provision costs by 2.5 billion euro over 3.5 years. Using a different lead, optimization from S-8308, eprosartan was developed by SmithKline Beecham in 1992. Eprosartan does not have a biphenyl-methyl structure but in order to mimic the C-terminal end of Ang II the 5-acetic acid group was replaced with an a-thienylacrylic acid and a 4-carboxy-moiety. Eprosartan is a selective, potent and competitive AT1 antagonist and its binding to AT1 receptors is rapid, reversible, saturable and of high affinity. ===Development from losartan to other drugs=== Losartan, valsartan, candesartan, irbesartan, telmisartan and olmesartan all contain a biphenyl-methyl group. Losartan is partly metabolized to its 5-carboxylic acid metabolite EXP 3174, which is a more potent AT1 receptor antagonist than its parent compound and has been a model for the continuing development of several other ARBs. Valsartan, candesartan and irbesartan were all developed in 1990. Valsartan, first marketed by Novartis, is a nonheterocyclic ARB, where the imidazole of losartan has been replaced by an acylated amino acid. Irbesartan was developed by Sanofi Research and is longer acting than valsartan and losartan and it has an imidazolinone ring where a carbonyl group functions as a hydrogen bond acceptor instead of the hydroxymethyl group in losartan. Irbesartan is a non- competitive inhibitor. Candesartan cilexetil (TCV 116) is a benzimidazole which was developed at Takeda and is an ester carbonate prodrug. In vivo, it is rapidly converted to the much more potent corresponding 7-carboxylic acid, candesartan. In the interaction of candesartan with AT1 receptor the carboxyl group of the benzimidazole ring plays an important role. Candesartan and its prodrug have stronger blood pressure lowering effects than EXP 3174 and losartan. Telmisartan, which was discovered and developed in 1991 by Boehringer Ingelheim, has carboxylic acid as the biphenyl acidic group. It has the longest elimination half-life of the ARBs or about 24 hours. Olmesartan medoxomil was developed by Sankyo in 1995 and is the newest ARB on the market, marketed in 2002. It is an ester prodrug like candesartan cilexetil. In vivo, the prodrug is completely and rapidly hydrolyzed to the active acid form, olmesartan (RNH-6270). It has a hydroxyisopropyl group connected to the imidazole ring in addition to the carboxyl group. ===Pharmacophore and structure-activity relationship=== Pharmacophore There are three functional groups that are the most important parts for the bioactivity of ARBs, see figure 1 for details. The first one is the imidazole ring that binds to amino acids in helix 7 (Asn295). The second group is the biphenyl-methyl group that binds to amino acids in both helices 6 and 7 (Phe301, Phe300, Trp253 and His256). The third one is the tetrazole group that interacts with amino acids in helices 4 and 5 (Arg167 and Lys199). The tetrazole group has been successfully replaced by a carboxylic acid group as is the case with telmisartan. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) Most of the ARBs have the same pharmacophore so the difference in their biochemical and physiological effects is mostly due to different substituents. Activity of a drug is dependent of its affinity for the substrate site and the length of time it binds to the site. Lipophilic substituents like the linear alkyl group at the 2-position on the imidazole ring together with the biphenyl-methyl group, associate with hydrophobic pockets of the receptor. An acidic group like tetrazole, CO2H or NHSO2CF3 at the 1-position of the biphenyl-methyl group will bind to a basic position in the receptor and are required for potent antagonistic activity. In valsartan, the imidazole ring of losartan has been replaced with an acylated amino acid. Several substituents have been tried at the 4- and 5- positions on the imidazole ring. The chloro and hydroxymethyl groups connected to these positions in losartan are probably not of much importance in receptor binding since the other ARBs do not possess these functional groups and have comparable or better binding affinities than losartan. Irbesartan has a carbonyl group at the 5-position, functioning as a hydrogen bond acceptor in place of the hydroxymethyl group of losartan, resulting in a longer binding to the receptor. The structure of eprosartan is the one that differs most from the other ARBs, the usual biphenyl-methyl group has been replaced by a carboxy benzyl group that mimics more closely the phenolic moiety of Tyr4 group of Ang II. This change results in a stronger binding to the receptor but the biochemical and physiological effects are not significantly improved. Telmisartan has a carboxylic acid at the 2-position of the biphenyl-methyl group and is more potent than the tetrazole analogue. It has been reported that imidazoles that have hydroxymethyl and carboxy groups at the 4- and 5 position, possessed potent antagonistic activity, caused by the hydrogen bonding and hydrophilicity of the hydroxymethyl group. It has also been reported that an hydroxy group in the 4-position on the imidazole ring, plays an important role in the binding affinity and compensates for the disadvantage of lipophilicity of the bulky alkyl group. These results show that a medium-sized hydroxy alkyl group, such as CHMeOH and CMe2OH, is favorable for the substituent of the 4-position on the imidazole ring. Furthermore, the ionizable group is favorable for the binding affinity. Candesartan and olmesartan have the highest affinity for the AT1 receptors, followed by irbesartan and eprosartan. Valsartan, telmisartan and EXP 3174 have similar affinities that are about ten-fold less than that of candesartan. Losartan has the least affinity. ARBs' affinity for the AT2 receptor is generally much lower (or around 10,000 times less) than for the AT1 subtype. Therefore, they allow unhindered stimulation of the AT2 receptor. ==Drug comparison and pharmacokinetics== {  border=\\"1\\" + Table 1: Comparison of ARB pharmacokinetics - ! Drug !

As can be seen in table 1, these drugs are highly plasma protein-bound and therefore oral administration once a day should provide sufficient antihypertensive effects. Around 14% of orally ingested losartan is metabolized to its 5-carboxylic acid metabolite EXP 3174. As mentioned before, candesartan cilexetil and olmesartan medoxomil are inactive ester prodrugs that are completely hydrolyzed to their active forms by esterases during absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. These three metabolites are more potent AT1 receptor antagonists than their prodrugs. The other ARBs do not have active metabolites. All of the ARBs, except for valsartan and olmesartan, are metabolized in some way by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme 2C9, that is found in the human liver. CYP2C9 is for example responsible for the metabolizing of losartan to EXP 3174 and the slow metabolizing of valsartan and candesartan to their inactive metabolites. Telmisartan is, on the other hand, in part metabolized by glucuronidation and olmesartan is excreted as the unchanged drug. Telmisartan is the only ARB that can cross the blood‚Äìbrain barrier and can therefore inhibit centrally mediated effects of Ang II, contributing to even better blood pressure control. All of the ARBs have the same mechanism of action and differences in their potency can be related to their different pharmacokinetic profiles. A few clinical head-to-head comparisons have been made and candesartan, irbesartan and telmisartan appear to be slightly more effective than losartan in lowering blood pressure. This difference may be related to different strengths of activity at the receptor level, such as duration and strength of receptor binding. ==ARBs under development== Pratosartan structure. Several new nonpeptide ARBs are undergoing clinical trials or are at pre-clinical stages of development. Among these are embusartan (BAY 10-6734 or BAY 10-6734), KRH-594, fonsartan (HR 720) and pratosartan (KT3-671). Pratosartan, for example, has a novel structure: a seven-membered ring that bears an oxo moiety (C=O) fused to the imidazole ring (figure 4), and its affinity for the AT1 receptor is about 7 times higher than losartan's. The purpose of the oxo group is similar to that of the carboxylic acid groups on other ARBs. Other attributes of ARBs are also under investigation, such as the positive effects of telmisartan on lipid and glucose metabolism and losartan's effects of lowering uric acid levels. Such effects might lead to new indications for these drugs but further research is needed. ==See also== * Discovery and development of renin inhibitors ==References== Category:Angiotensin II receptor antagonists Angiotensin Receptor Blockers, Discovery And Development Of ","title":"Discovery and development of angiotensin receptor blockers"},{"id":"20206768","text":"Hilde Hovdenak (born 15 February 1971) is a retired Norwegian long-distance runner who specialized in the 10,000 metres.

He made an instant impression at Al Shorta, scoring in friendly matches against Al Naft and Naft Al Junoob. His first league goals came against Al Shorta's fierce rivals Al Quwa Al Jawiya at the Al Shaab Stadium, where N'Lend scored a hat-trick of headers to seal a 4‚Äì1 victory. This was when N'Lend became a fan favourite and wrote his name into the history books, becoming the first-ever non-Iraqi to score a hat-trick in the Iraqi Premier League. He then went on to score again at the Al Shaab Stadium against Al Naft in a 2‚Äì2 draw, followed by the winning goal against Naft Al Junoob in a 2‚Äì1 win. He continued his impressive record of scoring in every game he had played at Al Shaab Stadium with the winning goal in a 2‚Äì1 win over huge rivals Al Zawraa, however that record ended five days later in a 1‚Äì1 draw with Al Talaba, a game in which he missed an open goal. He eventually left the club in May 2013 after a dip in form; Al Shorta's vice-president Adnan Jafar stated that the club had several players that were capable of filling in his position. ==Honours== ;Al-Shorta * Iraqi Premier League: 2012‚Äì13 ==References * *Iraqsport Category:1986 births Category:Living people Category:Cameroonian footballers Category:Cameroonian expatriate footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:Shanghai Greenland Shenhua F.C. players Category:Liaoning F.C. players Category:Chinese Super League players Category:Expatriate footballers in Algeria Category:Cameroonian expatriate sportspeople in Algeria Category:Expatriate footballers in Slovakia Category:Cameroonian expatriate sportspeople in Slovakia Category:Expatriate footballers in China Category:MC Oran players Category:Cameroonian expatriate sportspeople in China Category:Fovu Baham players Category:Expatriate footballers in Morocco Category:Cameroonian expatriate sportspeople in Morocco Category:Fath Union Sport players Category:FC DAC 1904 Dunajsk√° Streda players Category:Slovak Super Liga players Category:Al-Shorta SC players Category:Expatriate footballers in Iraq Category:Cameroonian expatriate sportspeople in Iraq Category:Expatriate footballers in Jordan Category:Cameroonian expatriate sportspeople in Jordan ","title":"Jean Michel N'Lend"},{"id":"20206918","text":"Dreyfus is a 1931 British film on the Dreyfus affair, translated from the play by Wilhelm Herzog and Hans Rehfisch and the 1930 German film Dreyfus.

The programme aired every Friday between 7pm and 10pm. The original show aired each Friday and Saturday night between 10pm and 1am from March 2006 and March 2010 on Talkradio's parent station, Talksport. The show was cancelled by Talkradio on 3 June 2019 following an allegedly anti-Semitic tweet Galloway made a few days prior. Following the cancellation, Galloway announced that the show would be moving to the Russian owned news agency Sputnik, with it being broadcast in the United States on FM and online via YouTube. ==Outline== On 11 March 2006, Galloway began his radio show on Talksport, and two weeks later started a simultaneous broadcast on Talk 107, Talksport's Edinburgh-based sister station. Billed as The Mother of All Talk Shows. Following his January 2006 humorous impersonation of a cat fed milk by actress Rula Lenska on Channel 5's Celebrity Big Brother, Galloway chose to begin every radio broadcast with the theme from the Top Cat cartoon series,Arifa Akbar \\"George Galloway: Top cat of the talk shows\\", The Independent, 27 August 2007 followed by an extempore monologue by Galloway, dealing primarily with political issues, economics, international relations, political philosophy and other topical issues. The show's title refers to Saddam Hussein's remark that the Gulf War was \\"the mother of all battles\\". Galloway made an inexplicit allusion to Hussein's remark comments at the U.S. Senate \\"Oil For Food\\" hearing in May 2005, when he called the hearing \\"the mother of all smokescreens\\". After the opening monologue, Galloway invited callers to challenge his views, with a preference for those who disagree with him and women callers. Galloway occasionally called his program The Great Debate and is different from other talk show hosts in that he willingly and ably debated hostile callers and encouraged those who strongly disagree with him to call \\"if you think you‚Äôre hard enough\\". In June 2009, the broadcasting regulator Ofcom said that several of Galloway's Talksport programme between November 2008 and January 2009 had broken its guidelines by moving away from a debating format \\"to campaign on a major matter of controversy\\", because Galloway had called on listeners to join demonstrations against Israel because of the 2008‚Äì9 Gaza War. Ofcom rejected complaints that the programmes concerned had failed to observe its impartiality rules.Simon Rocker \\"George Galloway rapped by Ofcom for radio show\\", The Jewish Chronicle, 25 June 2009 Galloway stopped presenting the show on 27 March 2010, due to campaign commitments in the 2010 UK General Election. ==Galloway's subsequent Talksport and Talkradio programmes== In August 2010, Galloway returned to the station with a new show in a similar format, but titled The Week with George Galloway, described by the station as a \\"No-holds barred review of the past seven days around the world.\\" The end of this programme was announced in March 2012 in common with the dropping of all the non-sport elements of its scheduleJohn Plunkett \\"TalkSport to axe all non- sports content\\", The Guardian 7 March 2012 at the beginning of April. Galloway began to broadcast on Talkradio (which launched in March 2016 as a sister station to Talksport), after the 2016 London Mayoral election. The first programme was broadcast in the evening of 24 June 2016, and the last on 17 May 2019. ==References== Category:British talk radio programmes Category:George Galloway Category:2006 radio programme debuts ","title":"The Mother of All Talk Shows"},{"id":"20207005","text":"This is a list of genes, proteins or receptors named A1 or Alpha-1 : * Actin, alpha 1 * Actinin, alpha 1 * Adaptor-related protein complex 2, alpha 1 * Aldehyde dehydrogenase 3 family, member A1 * Aldehyde dehydrogenase 4 family, member A1 * Aldehyde dehydrogenase 5 family, member A1 * Aldehyde dehydrogenase 6 family, member A1 * Aldehyde dehydrogenase 9 family, member A1 * Aldehyde dehydrogenase 18 family, member A1 * Aldo-keto reductase family 1, member A1 * Alpha-1-microglobulin/bikunin precursor * Apolipoprotein A1 and ApoA-1 Milano * ATPase, H+ transporting, lysosomal V0 subunit a1 * ATPase, Na+/K+ transporting, alpha 1 * ATP synthase, H+ transporting, mitochondrial F1 complex, alpha 1 * BCL2-related protein A1 * Butyrophilin, subfamily 1, member A1 * Butyrophilin, subfamily 3, member A1 * Capping protein (actin filament) muscle Z-line, alpha 1 * Carboxypeptidase A1 * Casein kinase 1, alpha 1 * Casein kinase 2, alpha 1 * Catenin (cadherin-associated protein), alpha 1 * Centaurin, alpha 1 * Cholinergic receptor, nicotinic, alpha 1 * Coagulation factor XIII, A1 polypeptide * collagen, type I, alpha 1 * collagen, type II, alpha 1 * Collagen, type III, alpha 1 * Collagen, type IV, alpha 1 * Collagen, type V, alpha 1 * Collagen, type VI, alpha 1 * Collagen, type VII, alpha 1 * Collagen, type VIII, alpha 1 * Collagen, type IX, alpha 1 * Collagen, type X, alpha 1 * Collagen, type XI, alpha 1 * Collagen, type XII, alpha 1 * Collagen, type XIII, alpha 1 * Collagen, type XIV, alpha 1 * Collagen, type XV, alpha 1 * Collagen, type XVI, alpha 1 * Collagen, type XVII, alpha 1 * Collagen, type XVIII, alpha 1 * Collagen, type XIX, alpha 1 * Collagen, type XXV, alpha 1 * Collagen, type XXVII, alpha 1 * Crystallin, beta A1 * Cyclic nucleotide-gated channel alpha 1 * Cyclin A1 * Cytochrome P450, family 1, member A1 * Defensin, alpha 1 * Dystrophin-associated protein A1 * Ephrin A1 * Eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha 1 * Family with sequence similarity 13, member A1 * Family with sequence similarity 19 (chemokine (C-C motif)-like), member A1 * Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) A receptor, alpha 1 * Gap junction protein, alpha 1 * GDNF family receptor alpha 1 * Glutathione S-transferase A1 * Glycine receptor, alpha 1 * Heat shock protein 90kDa alpha (cytosolic), member A1 * Hemoglobin, alpha 1 * Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 * Homeobox A1 * Immunoglobulin heavy constant alpha 1 * Importin alpha 1 * Interferon, alpha 1 * Interleukin 13 receptor, alpha 1 * Karyopherin alpha 1 * Laminin, alpha 1 * Major histocompatibility complex, class II, DP alpha 1 * Major histocompatibility complex, class II, DQ alpha 1 * Myosin light chain A1, an actin-binding protein * NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone), alpha 1 * Nucleolar protein, member A1 * PCDHA4 * Phospholipase A1 * Phosphorylase kinase, alpha 1 * Plexin A1 * Polymerase (DNA directed), alpha 1 * Potassium large conductance calcium-activated channel, subfamily M, alpha 1 * Proteasome (prosome, macropain) subunit, alpha 1 * Protein kinase, AMP-activated, alpha 1 * Protein tyrosine phosphatase, receptor type, f polypeptide (PTPRF), interacting protein (liprin), alpha 1 * Protocadherin alpha 1 * Pulmonary surfactant-associated protein A1 * Pyruvate dehydrogenase (lipoamide) alpha 1 * RNA binding motif protein, Y-linked, family 1, member A1 * Replication protein A1 * S100 calcium binding protein A1 * Sec61 alpha 1 * Serum amyloid A1 * Solute carrier family 35 (CMP-sialic acid transporter), member A1 * Spectrin, alpha 1 * Sperm protein associated with the nucleus, X-linked, family member A1 * Syntrophin, alpha 1 * Transient receptor potential cation channel, member A1 * UDP glucuronosyltransferase 1 family, polypeptide A1 * Urea Transporter A1 * a gene found in the maize encoding for the dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (reducing dihydroflavonols into flavan-4-ols) in the phlobaphene metabolic pathway ;

Their shape resembles the hide of an ox with a protruding handle in each of the ingot‚Äôs four corners. Early thought was that each ingot was equivalent to the value of one ox. However, the similarity in shape is simply a coincidence. The ingots' producers probably designed these protrusions to make the ingots easily transportable overland on the backs of pack animals. Complete or partial oxhide ingots have been discovered in Sardinia, Crete, Peloponnese, Cyprus, Cannatello in Sicily, Boƒüazk√∂y in Turkey (ancient Hattusa, the Hittite capital), Qantir in Egypt (ancient Pi-Ramesses), and Sozopol in Bulgaria. Archaeologists have recovered many oxhide ingots from two shipwrecks off the coast of Turkey (one off Uluburun and one in Cape Gelidonya). ==Context== The appearance of oxhide ingots in the archaeological record corresponds with the beginning of the bulk copper trade in the Mediterranean‚Äîapproximately 1600 BC. The earliest oxhide ingots found come from Crete and date to the Late Minoan IB, approximately 1500 BC to 1450 BC. The latest oxhide ingots date to approximately 1000 BC, and were found on Sardinia. The copper trade was largely maritime: the principal sites where oxhide ingots are found are at sea, on the coast, and on islands. ==Purposes== It is uncertain whether the oxhide ingots served as a form of currency. Ingots found in excavations at Mycenae are now part of the exhibits of the Numismatic Museum of Athens. Cemal Pulak argues that the weights of the Uluburun ingots are similar enough to have allowed \\"a rough but quick reckoning of a given quantity of raw metal prior to weighing\\". But George Bass proposes, via the Gelidonya ingots, whose weights are approximately the same if somewhat lower than the Uluburun ingot weights, that the weights were not standard and thus the ingots were not a currency. Another theory is that the oxhide shape, as well as the bun shape that some ingots took, was a visual statement that the ingot at hand is part of a legitimate trade. In Sardinia, oxhide ingot fragments have been found in hoards with bun ingots and scrap metal and, in some cases, in a metallurgical workshop. Citing this evidence, Vasiliki Kassianidou argues that the oxhide ingots \\"were meant to be used rather than to be kept as prestige goods\\". ==Major findsUluburun shipwreck=== In 1982, a diver discovered a shipwreck off the shore of Uluburun, Turkey.Cemal Pulak, \\"The Uluburun Shipwreck,\\" The Ship of Uluburun, trans. √únsal Yal√ßin, (Bochum: Deutsches Bergbau-Museum, 2006), 6. The ship contained 317 copper ingots in the normal oxhide shape, 36 with only two corner protrusions, 121 shaped like buns, and five shaped like pillows. The oxhide ingots (ingots with two or four protrusions) range in weight from after being cleaned of their corrosion. These ingots were found stacked in four rows following a herringbone pattern. The smooth sides of the ingots faced downwards, and the lowest layer rested on brushwood. There are three whole tin oxhide ingots, and there are many tin ingots cut into quarters or halves, with their corner protrusion(s) still intact. Besides metal ingots, the cargo included ivory, metal jewelry, and Mycenaean, Cypriot, and Canaanite pottery. Tree-ring dating of firewood from the ship gives an approximate date of 1300 BC. More than 160 copper oxhide ingots, 62 bun ingots, and some of the tin oxhide ingots have incised marks typically on their rough sides. Some of these marks‚Äîresembling fish, oars, and boats‚Äîrelate to the sea, and they were probably incised after casting, when the ingot was received or exported. Recently Yuval Goren proposed that the ten tons of copper ingots, one ton of tin ingots, and the resin stored in the Canaanite jars aboard the ship were one complete package. The recipients of the copper, tin, and resin would have used these materials for bronze casting through the lost-wax technique.Yuval Goren, \\"International Exchange in the Eastern Mediterranean: Food and Ships, Sealing-Wax and Kings as Seen Under the Petrographic Microscope,\\" Institute of Archaeology Kenyon Lecture, London, 13 Nov. 2008. ===Cape Gelidonya shipwreck=== In the early 1950s, divers found the remains of a shipwreck in Cape Gelidonya, off the coast of Turkey. The remains included a substantial amount of copper oxhide ingot material: 34 in full, five in half, 12 corners, and of random fragments. Twenty-four full copper oxhide ingots have stamps on their centers‚Äîusually of a circle containing intersecting lines. These stamps were likely made when the metal was soft. In addition, the ship contained numerous complete and incomplete copper bun-shaped ingots, rectangular tin bars, and Cypriot agricultural tools made of scrap bronze.George F. Bass, \\"Bronze Age Shipwrecks on the Eastern Mediterranean,\\" The Ship of Uluburun, trans. √únsal Yal√ßin, (Bochum: Deutsches Bergbau-Museum, 2006), 3. Radiocarbon dating of brushwood from the ship gives an approximate date of 1200 BC. ==Composition and microstructure== Typically the copper oxhide ingots are highly pure (approximately 99 weight percent copper) with trace element content of less than one weight percent. The few tin oxhide ingots that have been available to study are also exceptionally pure. Microscopic analysis of the Uluburun copper oxhide ingots reveals that they are highly porous. This feature results from the effervescence of gases as the molten metal cooled. Slag inclusions are also present. Their existence implies that slag was not fully removed from the smelted metal and thus that the ingots were made from remelted copper. Macroscopic observation of the Uluburun copper ingots indicates that they were cast through multiple pours; there are distinct layers of metal in each ingot. Furthermore, the relatively high weight and high purity of the ingots would be difficult to achieve even today in only one pour. The porosity of the copper ingots and the natural brittleness of tin suggest that both metal ingots were easy to break. As Bass et al. proposes, a metalsmith could simply break off a piece of the ingot whenever he liked for a new casting. ==Provenance== Controversy has swirled around the provenance of the copper oxhide ingots. Lead isotope analysis (LIA) suggests that the late LBA ingots (that is, after 1250 BC) are composed of Cypriot copper, specifically copper from the Apilki mine and its surrounding area. The Gelidonya ingots' ratios are consistent with Cypriot ores while the Uluburun ingots fall on the periphery of the Cypriot isotopic field.Pulak 2006: 9. On the other hand, Late Minoan I ingots found on Crete have Paleozoic lead isotope ratios and are more consistent with ore sources in Afghanistan, Iran, or Central Asia. The controversy settles on the validity of LIA. Paul Budd argues that LBA copper is the product of such extensive mixing and recycling that LIA, which works best for metals from a single ore deposit, is unfeasible.James D. Muhly, \\"Copper and Bronze in the Late Bronze Aegean,\\" The Ship of Uluburun, trans. √únsal Yal√ßin, (Bochum: Deutsches Bergbau-Museum, 2006), 72. Some scholars worry that the 1250 BC date is too limiting. They note that Cyprus was smelting copper on a large scale in the early LBA and had the potential to export the metal to Crete and other places at this time. Furthermore, copper ore is more plentiful on Cyprus than on Sardinia and far more plentiful than on Crete. Archaeologists have discovered numerous Cypriot exports to Sardinia including metalworking tools and prestige metal objects.Fulvia Lo Schiavo, \\"Cyprus and Sardinia,\\" Archaeometallurgy in Sardinia, eds. Fulvia Lo Schiavo et al., (Montagnac: √âditions Monique Mergoil, 2005), 313. Due to the heavy corrosion of tin oxhide ingots and the limited data for lead isotopic studies of tin, the provenance of the tin ingots has been uncertain.Pulak 2006: 12. The fact that scholars have been unable to pinpoint Bronze Age tin ore deposits compounds this problem.Pulak 2006: 11-12. ==Molds== A mold for casting an oxhide ingot was discovered in the LBA north palace at Ras Ibn Hani in Syria. It is made of fine-grained \\"ramleh\\", a \\"shelly\\" limestone. Archaeologists found burnt copper droplets around the mold. In spite of the questionable durability of limestone, Paul Craddock et al. concluded that limestone can be used for casting ‚Äúlarge simple shapes‚Äù such as oxhide ingots. Evolution of carbon dioxide from the limestone would damage the metal surface that touched the mold. Thus, metal objects requiring surface detail could not be produced successfully. This is not to say that oxhide ingots were normally cast in limestone molds. Using an experimental clay mold, Bass et al. argue that the ingot's smooth side was in contact with the mold while its rough side was exposed to the atmosphere. The roughness results from the interaction of the atmosphere and the cooling metal. ==Bronze stands with oxhide ingot depictions== In the Late Bronze Age, Cyprus produced numerous bronze stands that depicted a man carrying an oxhide ingot. The stands were designed to hold vases, and they were cast through the lost-wax process. The ingots show the familiar shape of four protruding handles, and the men carry them over their shoulders. These Cypriot stands were exported to Crete and Sardinia, and both islands created similar stands in local bronze workshops. ==Egyptian connections== While only one oxhide ingot fragment has been recovered from Egypt (in the context of a LBA smelting workshop), there is a wide array of painted scenes in Egypt that show oxhide ingots. The earliest scene dates to the 15th century BC and the latest scene to the 12th century BC. The ingots display their typical four protrusions, and red paint (which suggests they are copper) is preserved on them. The captions accompanying the scenes explain that the men who bring the ingots come from the north, specifically Retnu (Syria) and Keftiu (unidentified). They are shown being carried on the shoulders of men, sitting with other goods in storage, or as part of scenes in smelting workshops. In a relief from Karnak, the pharaoh Amenhotep II is seen riding a chariot and spearing an oxhide ingot with five arrows. A laudatory caption emphasizing the pharaoh‚Äôs strength accompanies the scene. Several of the ‚ÄúAmarna letters‚Äù dating to the mid-14th century BC refer to hundreds of copper talents‚Äîin addition to goods such as elephant tusks and glass ingots‚Äîsent from the kingdom of Alashiya to Egypt. Some scholars identify Cyprus with Alashiya. In particular, the Uluburun cargo is similar to the goods that, according to the letters, Alashiya sent to Egypt. ==References * Copper ingot in the shape of an oxhide at the British Museum website. * Oxhide ingot found at Enkomi, Cyprus, now in the British Museum * Bronze stand showing oxhide ingot-bearer, found at Kourion, Cyprus, now in the British Museum Category:Bronze Age Category:Bronze Age Europe Category:Archaeological artefact types Category:History of metallurgy ","title":"Oxhide ingot"},{"id":"20207052","text":"Girolamo Tartarotti (;. 1706‚Äì1761) was an Italian abbot, Neo-Platonist,. and writer, primarily famed for his works on witchcraft. ==Life== Tartarotti was born at Rovereto near Trent and studied at the University of Padua. For a time, he formed part of the entourage of Marco Foscarini, who later served as doge of Venice. Following the execution of the elderly nun Maria Renata Singer on charges of witchcraft, he took part in the academic debate over the witchcraft trials of his time, attempting to strike a middle ground which‚Äîagainst Martin Delrio and Benedetto Bonelli‚Äîdismissed most purported claims of witchcraft while, on the grounds of its appearance in scripture,. upholding the existence of sorcery against the skepticism of Scipione Maffei and Count Carli. The equivocation such a position entailed was first refuted by Bonelli in 1751.. ==Works== Abbot Tartarotti's Three Books on the Nocturnal Congress of the Lamia‚Äîcomposed in 1748 but delayed from publication by the Venetian Inquisition until 1750‚Äîproposed that witchcraft was an organized religion descended from the Romans' cults of Diana and Erodiade. This was an unpopular and heterodox idea, and he was obliged to restate some points in an apologia two years later.. He had the sermons of the Jesuit Georg Gaar, one of the clerics responsible for Sister Maria's execution, translated into Italian so as to publish his own attacks against the man's points.. He defended the existence of witchcraft, however, and won the vast majority of Italian academics to his side of the debate. *Ragionamento intorno alla poesia lirica toscana (1728) *Idea della logica degli scolastici e dei moderni (1731) *Delle disfide letterarie, o sia pubbliche difese di conclusioni (1735) *De origine Ecclesiae tridentinae et primis eius episcopis (1743) *Memorie istoriche intorno alla vita e morte de' santi Sisinio, Martirio ed Alessandro (1745) *De versione Rufiniana Historiae ecclesiasticae Eusebii Caesariensis dissertatio, in qua Valesianae interpretationis dignitas et praestantia vindicatur (1748) * . *De auctoribus ab Andrea Dandulo laudatis in Chronico Veneto (1751) * . *Lettera di un giornalista d'Italia ad un giornalista oltramontano sopra il libro intitolato: Vindiciae Romani Martyrologii uscito in Verona (1751) *Memorie antiche di Rovereto e dei luoghi circonvicini (1754) *Apologia delle Memorie antiche di Rovereto (1758) *Dell'origine della Chiesa di Aquileia (1759) *Lettera seconda di un giornalista d'Italia ad un giornalista oltramontano sopra il libro intitolato: Notizie istorico-critiche intorno al b.m.

Though most of the tracks did away with the backing she had used on her previous two albums, Illuminations had a completely different sound from anything she had previously done. From a basis of vocals and acoustic guitar, Sainte-Marie and producer Maynard Solomon used electronic synthesisers to create a sound that was much more experimental music than folk. Indeed, Illuminations was the first quadrophonic vocal album ever made, and on songs like the album's only single \\"Better to Find Out Yourself\\", her voice is completely altered by a Buchla synthesiser. Peter Schickele, however, did provide arrangements to \\"Mary\\", \\"Adam\\" and \\"The Angel\\", whilst the four tracks \\"Suffer the Little Children\\", \\"With You, Honey\\", \\"Guess Who I Saw in Paris\\" and \\"He's A Keeper of the Fire\\" were her first work to be not produced by Vanguard boss Maynard Solomon. Instead, they had a stripped-down rock sound and were produced by little known folk-jazz songwriter Mark Roth. Bob Bozina played guitar, John Craviotta drums and percussion, and Rick Oxendine played bass. ==Reception== Illuminations has acquired a fan base quite distinct from that associated with any of Sainte-Marie's other albums. In addition to its being cited as a favourite album by a number of musicians (notably Steve Hackett), a number of critics have seen its twisted, eerie soundscapes as laying the grounds for the evolution of gothic music as well as having an influence on New Weird America.

It has either 4 or 5 strings, normally tuned GDAE and CGDAE, respectively, and has the scale of a cavaco. ==History== The instrument evolved from the so-called \\"electric log\\", developed in the early 1940s by Adolfo \\"Dod√¥\\" Nascimento and Osmar √Ålvares Mac√™do, in Salvador, Brazil. It was equipped with four single strings mounted across a lengthy slab of wood and the neck of a cavaco (hence the names). During the 1950s and 60s, it was used exclusively to play instrumental music during carnival celebrations in Bahia. By the mid-1970s, when it became popular among Brazilian rock and pop musicians, it adopted its current name. This instrument apparently evolved in isolation from the efforts of contemporary American developers like Les Paul or Leo Fender, and given that solid-body electric mandolins did not appear in the United States until the 1950s, the Bahian guitar can be regarded almost as the eldest known electric mandolin, or a descend from its own distinct line of prehistoric solid body guitars. To the degree in which the Bahian guitar counts as a mandolin (despite the differences in measure and lack of double strings ‚Äì just like in the case of the Mandocaster), the \\"Electric Log\\" constitutes the eldest known solid-body electric mandolin. Until its invention, North American developers had not applied the principle of solid or almost-solid bodies to mandolins to the same extent as they had to guitars. The Bahian guitar was also the first headless solid-body electric plucked instrument, and nowadays it is usually manufactured to resemble a miniature electric guitar. ==Carnival usage== This instrument is intimately connected to the Brazilian Carnival, where it is used extensively, especially in Salvador. More importantly though, its creators must be credited with having set important accents in Brazilian popular music, by inventing an 'endemic' Brazilian version of the electric-guitar, and by supplying it with an individual musical language and style, before anything of such could be imported from abroad. In the late 1960s in Brazil during the Tropicalia movement, there was a lot of disapproval from musicians and critics towards the addition of elements from British/American pop and rock into Brazilian music ‚Äì including the use of electric guitars. The occurred however, is nowadays seen in Brazil as silly protests from those years (by many of the responsible, in fact). Nevertheless, the Bahian guitar was responsible for revolutionizing the carnival in the 1950s as an essential ingredient of the \\"Electric trio\\" tradition (especially on a space-restricted environment), which since then became the single most important trademark of the Bahia/Brazilian street carnival. ==External links== * Guitarra Baiana at Plate to Plate (archived GeoCities page) * Guitarra Baiana Guitarra Baiana. ==References== Category:Mandolin family instruments Category:Guitar family instruments Category:Brazilian musical instruments Category:Amplified instruments Category:Electric guitars ","title":"Bahian guitar"},{"id":"20207184","text":"Erecth√©e Bibiena M√©lanie Marie \\"Bienna\\" P√©l√©gry, later Boiteux (24 August 1899 - 18 January 1989),fichier des d√©c√®s was a French freestyle swimmer who competed in the 1924 Summer Olympics and in the 1928 Summer Olympics.

It is both enabler and beneficiary of other key Government of India schemes, such as Industrial corridor, Make in India, Startup India, Standup India, Sagarmala, Bharatmala, UDAN-RCS, Digital India, BharatNet. ==Historical perspective== In April 2005, wherein, India and Japan announced collaboration for feasibility and possible funding of the dedicated rail freight corridors, and RITES was entrusted with the feasibility study of both eastern and western corridors, followed by formation of a Planning Commission's Task Force to prepare a concept paper on Delhi-Mumbai (Western) and Delhi-Howrah (Eastern) dedicated freight corridor projects, and to suggest a new organizational structure for planning, financing, construction and operation of these corridors. In January 2006, RITES submitted the Feasibility Study Report of both the corridors and Cabinet approved Task Force's report, Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) gave \\"in principle\\" approval to the Feasibility Study report. Subsequently, RITES submitted the PETS Report based on which the project was approved at a cost of ‚Çπ28,181 crore. == Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFC) == Under the Eleventh Five Year Plan of India (2007‚Äì12), the Ministry of Railways started constructing a new Dedicated Freight Corridor (DFC) in two long routes, namely the Eastern and Western freight corridors. The two routes cover a total length of , with the Eastern Dedicated Freight Corridor stretching from Ludhiana in Punjab to Dankuni in West Bengal and the Western Dedicated Freight Corridor from Jawaharlal Nehru Port in Mumbai (Maharashtra) to Dadri in Uttar Pradesh. Upgrading of transportation technology, increase in productivity and reduction in unit transportation cost are the focus areas for the project. DFCCIL has been designated by the Government of India as a 'special purpose vehicle', and has been created to undertake planning & development, mobilisation of financial resources and construction, maintenance and operation of the Dedicated Freight Corridors. DFCCIL has been registered as a company under the Companies Act 1956 on 30 October 2006. === Need for DFC=== The Indian Railways have witnessed higher freight volumes without substantial investment in infrastructure, increased axle load, reduction of turn-round time of rolling stock, reduced unit cost of transportation, rationalization of tariffs resulting in improvement in market share and improved operational margins. Over the last 2 to 3 years, the railway freight traffic has grown by 8 to 11%, which is projected to cross 110 crore (1,100 million) tonnes by the end of 11th Five Year Plan. === Golden Quadrilateral Freight Corridor (GQFC) === GQFC has 6 DFCs, 2 are being implemented and the funding for the remaining 4 was approved in January 2018. The rail tracks linking four largest metropolitan cities of Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata and two diagonals North-South Dedicated Freight Corridor (Delhi-Chennai) and East-West Dedicated Freight Corridor (Kolkata-Mumbai) are called the Golden Quadrilateral (GQFC). These carry 55% of the India Railway's freight traffic over a total route length. The line capacity utilisation on the existing highly saturated shared trunk routes of Howrah-Delhi on the Eastern Corridor and Mumbai-Delhi on the Western Corridor varies between 115% to 150%. The surging requirement for the power generation requiring heavy coal movement, booming infrastructure construction and growing international trade has led to the conception of the GQFCs. Carbon emission reduction from DFCs will help DFCCIL claim carbon credits.

There are proposals to extend this line to Mangalore to connect India's biggest Petrochemical complex, international air-cargo facility (direct flights to gulf and Europe) and major seaport in Mangalore with Whitefield ICD (Inland Container Depot), through a tunnel being constructed with the help of Japan in the Western Ghats. This will result in hazardous petrochemicals currently being transported by road through tankers migrated to the railway cargo, resulting in efficiency improvements in country's energy security and safety to the common people living alongside national highways. * Heavy Haul Rail Corridor: Indian Port Rail Company Limited (IPRCL) has proposed of laying the third and fourth broad gauge railway line from Malegaon in Maharashtra to Paradip and Dhamra ports both on the Odisha Coast. The railway lines will be dedicated to carrying freight and mostly thermal coal. The development of this project will give a fillip to the government's initiative to promote multi- modal logistics and Coastal shipping. === Summary table of DFCs === Green background for the systems that are under construction.

Freight corridors of 3,300 km length will also be completed, freeing the dual use high demand trunk routes for running more high-speed passenger trains.Railways may invest Rs 20-lakh crore in high-speed corridors, The Economic Times, 23 December 2017. == Transformational effect on the Indian economy and railway == * Freight trains with 1.5 km length, 3660 mm width and 7.1 metre height clearance, a first and only in the world. * Double-stack standard shaped containers transported through electric locomotives with trailing loads of 15,000 ton and trains with 400 container capacity, a first and only in the world. * Bridges & formation to support 32.5 Ton axle load and track loading capacity of 12 t/m, a first at a large scale and travel distance. * 800 electric locomotives with 12,000 HP, biggest deployment of very high horse-powered locomotive anywhere in the world. * High speed freight trains running at speeds greater than 100 km/h. * Radio communication and GSM based tracking of all trains - a first in Indian railway sector. * DFC corridor has no level crossings and uses one of the most advanced construction techniques to improve the quality and speed of construction. * DFC aims to bring down the cost of freight transport using electrical fuel, bigger and larger trains. This will help Indian industry to become competitive in the world export market. * DFC will help India achieve the targets it has committed to in the Paris climate accord, by migrating from diesel propelled freight trains and fossil fuel-based road traffic to electricity based railway locomotives. India is a leader in renewable energy with most of the country's new electricity generation capacity added through solar, wind and nuclear sources. * The new generation pantograph allows an increase in the highest of the overhead wires (catenary height) from the standard 6 meters to 7.5 meters- setting the world record for the High Reach pantograph for highest catenary for electric locomotives. This will also enable Indian Railways to introduce double-decker passenger trains in high-density suburban passenger route and Ro-Ro cargo service across the Indian Railways network. * Indian passenger railway network will be able to run semi-high speed and high-speed trains in the existing network as cargo traffic will migrate to DFC. * Eastern DFC may not be able to support RoRo as it has height of 5.1 meter compared to 7.1 meter of the Western DFC. Because of this only Western DFC may be able to support RoRo services.

Incorporated in March 1988 under the Companies Act, CONCOR commenced operations in November 1989 taking over an existing network of seven inland container depots (ICDs) from Indian Railways. ==History== Indian Railway's strategic initiative to containerise cargo transport put India on the intermodal freight transport map for the first time in 1966. Given India's size (almost from North to South and East to West), rail transport is often a cheaper option for all cargo over medium and long distances, especially if the cost of inter-modal transfers can be reduced. Seeing that containerised multi-modal door-to-door transport provided a solution to this problem, in 1966 Indian Railways entered the market for moving door-to-door domestic cargo in special DSO containers. Although the first ISO container in India had been handled in Kochi as early as 1973, it was not until 1981 that the first ISO container was moved inland by Indian Railways to the country's first ICD at Bangalore, also managed by the Indian Railways. Expansion of the network to seven ICDs by 1988 saw an increase in container handling capacity, while along the way a strong view emerged that there was a need to set up a separate pro-active organisation to promote and manage the growth of containerisation in India. ==Core Business== CONCOR operates three core businesses: cargo carrier; terminal operator, warehouse operator & MMLP operation. ==References *Container Corporation of India Ltd.

It was established through funding from the World Bank and is located in New Delhi, the national capital. ==History== At the time of integration of the Indian Railway system in 1952, there were 41 repair workshops dealing with periodic overhaul of coaches, wagons and locomotives. Day-to-day repairs were handled in over 300 repair depots and sick lines. The last quarter century of planned development of Indian Railways has witnessed extensive changes in the mode of traction as well as development of new types of coaches and wagons. Diesel and electric locomotives have gradually replaced steam locomotives. The number of passenger coaches in service has almost doubled. The wagon stock holding is roughly 2.5 times that in 1951. Financial limitations, however, did not permit development of maintenance facilities compatible with the growth of rolling stock. Only 5 new workshops have been set up since 1952. The increased demand for maintenance was largely catered by piece-meal expansion of the existing facilities. Expenditure on workshops in this period was less than 2.5% of the total plan outlay on the railways. Nevertheless, to meet the requirement of new rolling stock, three new production workshops were set up. The problems encountered in manufacture and maintenance of the rolling stock is largely due to obsolescence of machinery and plant, diverse product mix and layout deficiencies. The situation in respect of machinery and plant is a source of major concern. The proportion of overage machines in 1979 had increased to 77% from 47% in 1952. Due to paucity of available maintenance funds, an agreement was negotiated with the International Development Association of the World Bank for providing a credit of $95m for the first phase of workshop modernisation programme expected to be completed by March 1983. Second and third phases of another 7 years envisage an estimated expenditure of Rs.400 crores inclusive of IDA Credits. The unprecedented magnitude of this effort prompted the Indian Railways to set up a specialist organisation wholly devoted to the furtherance of this task. Thus the Central Organisation for Modernisation of Workshops (COFMOW) came into existence in 1978 to implement the modernisation programme Cofmow is now the designated organisation of Indian Railways for selection, procurement and induction of modern workshop technologies and M&P.; == References  External links == * Official website Category:Railway companies of India Category:Railway workshops in India Category:Railway companies established in 1979 Category:1979 establishments in India Category:Companies based in Delhi ","title":"Central Organisation for Modernisation of Workshops"},{"id":"20207290","text":"Richard Condon (born 1937 in Belfast- died 1991 in County Mayo), was an impresario and theatre manager.

In early 1365 Louis I of Hungary, who like his predecessors styled himself \\"king of Bulgaria\\" (rex Bulgariae) among other titles, demanded that Ivan Sratsimir acknowledge his suzerainty and become his vassal. After Sratsimir's refusal, the Hungarian king undertook a campaign to conquer the Tsardom of Vidin. On 1 May 1365, he set off from Hungary; he reached Vidin on 30 May and captured the city on 2 June, after a brief siege.–ë–æ–∂–∏–ª–æ–≤, p. 202. The Hungarians took Ivan Sratsimir and his family captive and imprisoned them in the Humnik fortress in Bosiljevo, Croatia. Shortly afterwards, the Hungarians seized the entire land of the Tsardom of Vidin (known as Bodony in Hungarian) and turned it into a province of the Kingdom of Hungary governed by a ban. Initially, the area was governed by Peter Himfi, the Count of Pozsony, and then by Denis Lackfi, styled \\"voivode of Transylvania, governor of Vidin and ruler of the counties of Temes and Szolnok\\". ==Hungarian rule in Vidin== After establishing their administrative rule, the Hungarians proceeded to convert the local Bulgarian Orthodox population to Roman Catholicism with the assistance of Franciscan friars. Despite its short duration, this was one of the earliest Hungarian missionary dioceses. According to Hungarian data, the Franciscans converted 200,000 people or a third of the region's population; although the figure is considered grossly overestimated and unrealistic, among the converted were certainly Ivan Sratsimir and his royal family. That religious intolerance was reflected in the negative popular attitude towards the Hungarian overlordship, attested in a marginal note in an Orthodox religious book from the period: \\"This book was written by the sinful and unintelligent Dragan together with his brother Rayko in the days when the Hungarians ruled Vidin and it was great pain for the people at that time.\\"–ë–æ–∂–∏–ª–æ–≤, p. 209, note 61. Ivan Sratsimir's father, Tsar Ivan Alexander, ruler of Bulgaria at Tarnovo, could do nothing to stop the Hungarian invasion and his son's capture. Several years later, however, he took advantage of Byzantine Emperor John V Palaiologos' detention at Vidin and Count of Savoy Amadeus VI's campaign on the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast to organize an Orthodox coalition and salvage Vidin. For joining the alliance, Ivan Alexander offered the Byzantine emperor the Black Sea ports south of Nesebar (Messembria); in return, however, John V had to pay 180,000 florins to Vladislav I Vlaicu, voivode of Wallachia. The Vlach voivode would, in return, seize Vidin and cede it to Ivan Alexander. ==End of the banate== In 1369, the Hungarian occupation of Vidin was brought to an end. Although the initial campaign was not entirely successful because the Hungarians seized the city back, the ensuing negotiations between the Kingdom of Hungary and Ivan Alexander's allies, Vladislav I Vlaicu and Dobrotitsa, the despot of the semi- independent Dobrujan Principality of Karvuna, led to the return of the city to Bulgarian possession.

It belongs to the fungus moth family (Tineidae), and therein to the subfamily Nemapogoninae. Its junior synonym N. infimella was established by G.H. Heydenreich in the 1851 volume of his Lepidopterorum Europaeorum Catalogus Methodicus, but many sources still attribute it to G.A.W. Herrich-Sch√§ffer, who supposedly narrowly beat Heidenreich in (re)describing the species. But as it seems, Herrich-Sch√§ffer was merely one of the first to use the name proposed by Heydenreich, as the volume of his Systematische Bearbeitung der Schmetterlinge von Europa where he discussed the cork moth was not published until 1853 or 1854. That all nonwithstanding, the species had been already validly described by A.H. Haworth in the 1828 volume of Lepidoptera Britannica.FE (2009), Robinson [2010] ==Ecology and description== N. cloacella is a widespread species, found all across western Eurasia and North America, where it has recently been recorded from British Columbia.Shared but overlooked: 30 species of Holarctic Microlepidoptera revealed by DNA barcodes and morphology It is reportedly absent from France, but given that it occurs in all surrounding countries, this is unlikely to be correct. Its preferred habitat is woodland with a large amount of dead trees. The crepuscular adults are on the wing throughout the summer and are typically encountered at dusk but sometimes can be seen earlier in the day.FE (2009), Kimber [2010] This small moth has a wingspan of 10‚Äì18 mm. The forewings are irregularly mottled black, white and grey, resembling congeners such as the European corn moth (N. granella). The head has a tuft of pale yellow hairs. The caterpillars feed mainly on bracket fungi. Their food spectrum has been subject to considerable dispute in the past due to confusion with the European corn moth. Some claimed that N. cloacella caterpillars eat a wide range of food - dried fruit and mushrooms, seeds and other vegetable material, e.g. cereal grains, Capsicum annuum fruit, poppyseed (Papaver somniferum), bitter almonds (Prunus amygdalus amara) or bilberries (Vaccinium), but even cork (hence its common name) and beeswax. Other authors stated that they were only found on the oak mazegill fungus (Daedalea quercina), and ascribed the wide range of foodstuffs to N. granella. But as it seems, neither extreme was correct; the caterpillars do eat preferentially fungi - not only the oak mazegill but also others (e.g. birch polypore, Piptoporus betulinus) -, feeding on plant debris and similar materials when their favorite food is not available.Grabe (1942), Kimber [2010], and see references in Savela (2009) ==FootnotesReferences== * (2009): Nemapogon cloacella.

He served as Governor of the Indian State, Nagaland (1990‚Äì1992), and as the Chairperson of the Central Committee of World Council of Churches (1968‚Äì1975). ==Biography== Thomas was born on 15 May 1916 at Kozhenchery, Kerala India. His father M. M. Mammen was a reformation leader, printer and publisher based in Kozhenchery, Kerala, and was involved in the Independence Movement in India during the Salt Satygraha. His mother was Ooriapadickal Mariamma, a school teacher. He was the eldest of nine children. Thomas was raised in a Mar Thoma Syrian Church, in which his father was well known evangelist. In 1931, Thomas went to study Chemistry in a college in Trivandrum, Kerala, and had an evangelical spiritual experience. As a consequence, he became active in the Mar Thoma Youth Union and the Student Christian Movement, and became involved in evangelism among low-caste youth. Soon after obtaining his degree in 1935, he accepted the post of a teacher at Ashramam High School, Perumbavoor, run by the Mar Thoma Church, where the teachers used to pay part of their meager salary to the students from poor families. In 1937, instead of taking a lucrative job he went to Trivandrum, the capital of Kerala and started an orphanage there. Thomas was the first full-time Organizing secretary of Yuvajana Sakhyam (the Youth wing of the Mar Thoma Church) from 1945-47. He applied for ordination in the Mar Thoma Church, but that was rejected because of his membership in Communist party. At the same time he was rejected by the communist party because of his faith. Thomas became known for his ecumenical work, first being on staff with the World Student Christian Federation in Geneva (1947-1953), then serving as a moderator of the Central committee of the World Council of Churches (1968-1975). In 1990 he was appointed as Governor of Nagaland, a state with a large number of Christians, but later resigned in 1992. He was conferred with the honorary doctorate degree by the University of Uppsala in 1978. He was living at Manjadi, Tiruvalla. He died on 3 December 1996 and was laid to rest at Tiruvalla, Kerala. ==Works== #The acknowledged Christ of the Indian Renaissance (1969 SCM Press, London) #Risking Christ for Christ's Sake #Nagas towards 2000 #My Ecumenical Journey 1947-75 (1990) #Response to Tyranny ==References Further reading== * ==External links== * Category:1910 births Category:1996 deaths Category:People from Thiruvalla Category:Saint Thomas Christians Category:Indian Christian theologians Category:Governors of Nagaland Category:Christian communists ","title":"M.

It is endemic to Japan, but has been introduced worldwide, wherever there are Azaleas. ==Distribution== Initially described in the Netherlands from plants imported from Japan, it is found throughout Europe and has also been introduced to New Zealand and eastern Australia. In the southern part of Britain it occurs in sheltered gardens including Buckingham Palace, the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew and the Royal Horticultural Society Gardens, Wisley. It has been widely reported in greenhouses. In the United States the species can be found from Florida to Texas, and as far north as Long Island, West Virginia, and the Ohio Valley. On the west coast it is found in California, Washington and British Columbia, Canada. ==Description== The type locality is from Boskoop, Netherlands, and was described in 1913, from moths reared on Azalea indica, a cultivar of Rhododendron indicum, which was imported from Japan. The moths forewings are mainly dark-brown with a yellow band along the costal margin. The wingspan is and it flies from May to October depending on location and in Britain is double-brooded and sometimes there is a partial third brood. ==Ecology== Caloptilia azaleella deposits its eggs on azalea (Rhododendron spp) plants, under leaves near the midrib. Thiese are the only hosts so far recorded. The larva initially forms a mine and later rolls the leaf downwards from the tip, forming a cone. When mature a pale-brown pupa is formed in a white, membranous silken cocoon spun beneath a leaf and the moths can mate a week later. ==References * Lepiforum * Azalea Leaf Miner at UKmoths azaleella Category:Leaf miners Category:Moths described in 1913 Category:Endemic fauna of Japan Category:Moths of Africa Category:Moths of Asia Category:Moths of Australia Category:Moths of Europe Category:Moths of Japan Category:Moths of New Zealand Category:Moths of North America ","title":"Caloptilia azaleella"},{"id":"20207455","text":"On 14 March 1961 an aircraft accident occurred near Yuba City, California. A United States Air Force B-52F-70-BW Stratofortress bomber, AF Serial No. 57-0166, c/n 464155, carrying two nuclear weapons departed from Mather Air Force Base near Sacramento. According to the official Air Force report, the aircraft experienced an uncontrolled decompression that required it to descend to in order to lower the cabin altitude. Increased fuel consumption caused by having to fly at lower altitude, combined with the inability to rendezvous with a tanker in time caused the aircraft to run out of fuel. The aircrew ejected safely, and then the unmanned aircraft crashed west of Yuba City, tearing the nuclear weapons from the aircraft on impact. However, in a 2012 book LTC Earl McGill, a retired SAC B-52 pilot, claims that the aircrew, after an inflight refueling session that provided inadequate fuel, refused the offer of an additional, unscheduled inflight refueling, bypassed possible emergency landing fields and ran out of fuel. The crew ejected, the aircraft broke up and four onboard nuclear weapons were released. The weapons' multiple safety interlocks prevented both a nuclear explosion and release of radioactive material. LTC McGill, based on his SAC experience, blames the aircrew failures on the use of dexedrine to overcome tiredness on the 24-hour flight preceding the accident. The weapons did not detonate as their safety devices worked properly. A fireman was killed and several others injured in a road accident while en route to the accident scene. == Timeline == The following timeline is an abridged version of the description transcribed by Oskins and Maggelet from a declassified copy of the original Air Force accident report. Doe 11 was the aircraft call sign. Doe 13 was a second B-52 in formation for the first portion of the flight. All times are hours and minutes after takeoff. 0:20 ‚Äì the pilot first noticed excessive hot air coming from the pilots' vents. All attempts to control this hot air were unsuccessful. 6:00 ‚Äì Mather Command Post contacted the aircraft on HF radio. The heat problem was discussed and wing guidance received. This consisted of several suggested corrective actions which were verified by the pilot as having been used earlier without success. 6:30 ‚Äì Mather control room called the aircraft on HF radio and discussed the heat problem and the effects of the heat on the aircraft electronics and crew personnel. Wing guidance at this time was to continue the mission. 6:50 ‚Äì Mather control room contacted the aircraft and Wing guidance was to \\"continue mission as long as you can; call us back after second refueling tonight and advise us of your status, if it gets intolerable, of course, bring it home.\\" 11:15 ‚Äì Mather control called Doe 11 to see if he would complete the mission. At that the response was, \\"We are going to try.\\" 12:35 ‚Äì Mather control was contacted by Doe 11 and told that Doe 13's refueling was completed and \\"we are about ready to take off.\\" Control asked, \\"Your present status . . . has it improved?\\" The pilot answered \\"Negative . . . worse . . . number 3 engine setting at 70% . . . we had it once before and it cleared up but at this time it has not cleared as yet.\\" Control advised, \\"Understand you will proceed on course and we will be looking for you tomorrow.\\" 14:00 ‚Äì the outside panel of the pilot's L-4 window shattered. The heat in the cockpit was unbearable at this time and had cracked the glass case for the ball on both pilot's and co- pilot's turn and slip indicators. It is estimated that the upper compartment heat level ranged from 125‚Äì160 ¬∞F or higher during this period. A decision was made to depressurize the aircraft and attempt to continue the mission. Altitude was 33,500 feet. 14:20 ‚Äì after 20 minutes of unpressurized flight, the decision was made to descend to 12,000 feet and continue the mission as far as possible at this altitude. 15:00 ‚Äì Mather control contacted Doe 11 and asked \\"Which windshield is cracked and what is your present altitude?\\" Answer received, \\"The L-4 window shattered, heat unbearable at altitude, two sick crew members. We have descended to 12,000 feet and plan to go 150 nautical miles north of TP 3.19 and return direct to Mather.\\" They were advised to \\"proceed as planned, recommend you stay low altitude, give us an estimate on your fuel as soon as you get in close enough to contact us.\\" 16:50 ‚Äì Mather control contacted Doe 11 via HF radio requesting ETA to Mather. The aircraft reported, \\"We just passed TP 3.19 at 1212Z, estimate 150 nautical miles north of TP 3.19 at 1239Z, ETA to Mather 1755Z.\\" 18:50 ‚Äì Mather control contacted the aircraft through HF radio to check his progress. 19:45 ‚Äì McClellan called for flight plan and altitude required from last position to Mather. 20:30 ‚Äì aircraft contacted McClellan to ask Early Warning vessel \\"Hardware\\" to look out for them and would like a fix. 21:00 ‚Äì the aircraft contacted Mather control stating, \\"We would like a tanker up here and get a little fuel. We now figure we will be over the field at 14,000 pounds. That is a little light. We would like to have a tanker.\\" And, control answered Doe 11 \\"will be cleared for a straight in approach and will have tanker standby . . . we will not launch unless you go below 10,000 pounds.\\" Doe 11's ETA to Mather at this time was given as approximately 22:30 hours after takeoff. For approximately the next hour, several heading deviations up to 30 degrees were made by the pilot of Doe 11 to circumnavigate the weather associated with a front in this area. Turbulence was moderate. It is estimated from study of weather and Doe 11 pilot and navigator interviews that 7 or 8 minutes were lost during this frontal penetration due to these heading deviations. 21:50 ‚Äì Mather was contacted through HF radio and advised he had, \\"#1 main tank gauge stuck at 10,030 pounds . . . we are not sure just how much fuel we have in it now. We have No. 2 and one other 1/4 full warning light on and I think it would be a good idea to get that tanker airborne.\\" Mather Control Room advised, \\"We have a tanker airborne. Pick him up at Red Bluff VOR and refuel back in this direction. You might keep in mind, if things get a little close up there, head into Beale AFB.\\" Later in this same conversation, Mather control indicated, \\"We will get it off the ground here ASAP.\\" 22:10 ‚Äì Democrat contacted the aircraft on HF advising, \\"McClellan is requesting your present position.\\" The aircraft advised, \\" . . . just coasted in and looking for our tanker.\\" This was the last contact through Democrat HF radio. 22:10 ‚Äì the tanker was launched. 22:23 ‚Äì the bomber and the tanker initiated the head on rendezvous at 70 nautical miles. Normal mileage countdown was used and the bomber turned the tanker at 21 NM. This left Doe 11 flying at 280K IAS approximately 11NM behind the tanker after the tanker rolled out on refueling track. The bomber asked the tanker to slow down. The tanker reduced speed to 200K IAS, and then to 185K IAS. The bomber maintained 280K IAS to approximately 2NM behind this tanker, and then lost power. The pilot had warned the crew earlier of the possibility of bailout and he now alerted them to prepare for bailout. He initiated a 30-degree bank to the west toward a clear area as all engines flamed out together at approximately 22:40 hours after takeoff. The bailout sequence began at approximately 7,000 feet with an outside temperature of approximately 42 degrees, and was normal except the gunner could not jettison his turret despite full strength pull on the inner emergency release handle. The gunner was called forward and bailed out the navigator hatch, using the spare chute in the forward compartment. The pilot continued to guide the aircraft toward a clear area. The crew continued to bail out in order of navigator, spare navigator, spare pilot, EW, gunner, co-pilot and radar navigator. The pilot bailed out at 4,000 feet. The aircraft was trimmed and calculated to be at approximately a 21:1 glide ratio at this time. The aircraft made one complete 360-degree left turn and crashed into a clear flat barley field area 15.75 miles west of Yuba County Airport, California, at approximately 22:50 after takeoff. The aircraft struck the ground at a 15.3-degree left bank and an estimated attitude of 5 degrees nose down at an indicated airspeed of approximately 200 knots. Impact angle was approximately 45 degrees. ==See also== * List of accidents and incidents involving military aircraft == Notes References== Category:1961 in military history Category:Aviation accidents and incidents involving nuclear weapons Category:History of Sutter County, California Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in the United States in 1961 Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in California Category:20th-century military history of the United States Category:Decompression accidents and incidents Category:Accidents and incidents involving the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress Category:Aviation accidents and incidents caused by fuel exhaustion Yuba City B-52 crash Category:March 1961 events Category:Nuclear accidents and incidents in the United States ","title":"1961 Yuba City B-52 crash"},{"id":"20207464","text":"Durch fremde Hand is the ninth studio album by L'√Çme Immortelle.

Seagram & Sons, Inc., 340 U.S. 211 (1951), was a decision by the United States Supreme Court, which held that an agreement among competitors in interstate commerce to fix maximum resale prices of their products violates the Sherman Antitrust Act.. ==Background== The petitioner, Kiefer-Stewart Company, was an Indiana drug concern which does a wholesale liquor business. Respondents, Seagram and Calvert corporations, are affiliated companies that sell liquor in interstate commerce to Indiana wholesalers. Kiefer-Stewart brought this action in a federal district court for treble damages under the Sherman Act, and . The complaint charged that respondents had agreed or conspired to sell liquor only to those Indiana wholesalers who would resell at prices fixed by Seagram and Calvert, and that this agreement deprived Kiefer-Stewart of a continuing supply of liquor, to its great damage. On the trial, evidence was introduced tending to show that Seagram had fixed maximum prices above which the wholesalers could not resell. The jury returned a verdict for petitioner, and damages were awarded. The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed. It held that an agreement among respondents to fix maximum resale prices did not violate the Sherman Act, because such prices promoted, rather than restrained, competition. It also held the evidence insufficient to show that respondents had acted in concert. Doubt as to the correctness of the decision on questions important in antitrust litigation prompted the Supreme Court to grant certiorari. ==Holding== The Supreme Court ruled that the Court of Appeals erred in holding that an agreement among competitors to fix maximum resale prices of their products does not violate the Sherman Act. For such agreements, no less than those to fix minimum prices, cripple the freedom of traders, and thereby restrain their ability to sell in accordance with their own judgment.

They include antagonists, inverse agonists, and antibodies of CBRs. The discovery of the endocannabinoid system led to the development of CB1 receptor antagonists. The first CBR antagonist, rimonabant, was described in 1994. Rimonabant blocks the CB1 receptor selectively and has been shown to decrease food intake and regulate body-weight gain. The prevalence of obesity worldwide is increasing dramatically and has a great impact on public health. The lack of efficient and well-tolerated drugs to cure obesity has led to an increased interest in research and development of CBR antagonists. Cannabidiol (CBD), a naturally occurring cannabinoid, is a non-competitive CB1/CB2 receptor antagonist. And Œî9-tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV), a naturally occurring cannabinoid, modulate the effects of THC via direct blockade of cannabinoid CB1 receptors, thus behaving like first-generation CB1 receptor inverse agonists, such as rimonabant. CBD is a very low-affinity CB1 ligand, that can nevertheless affect CB1 receptor activity in vivo in an indirect manner, while THCV is a high-affinity CB1 receptor ligand and potent antagonist in vitro and yet only occasionally produces effects in vivo resulting from CB1 receptor antagonism. THCV has also high affinity for CB2 receptors and signals as a partial agonist, differing from both CBD and rimonabant. ==History== Cannabis plant For centuries hashish and marijuana from the Indian hemp Cannabis sativa L. have been used for medicinal and recreational purposes. In 1840, Schlesinger S. was apparently the first investigator to obtain an active extract from the leaves and flowers of hemp.Schlesinger S. Untersuchung der Cannabis sativa. Repertorium f√ºr die Pharmacie. 1840:190-208. A few years later, in 1848, Decourtive E. described the preparation of an ethanol extract that on evaporation of the solvent gave a dark resin, which he named ‚Äúcannabin‚Äù.Decourtive E. Note sur le haschisch. CR Hebd S√©ances Acad Sci..1848;26:509-510. In 1964 the main active constituent of C. sativa L., Œî9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), was isolated and synthesized by Mechoulam's laboratory. Two types of cannabinoid receptors, CB1 and CB2, responsible for the effects of THC were discovered and cloned in the early 1990s. Once cannabinoid receptors had been discovered, it became important to establish whether their agonists occur naturally in the body. This search led to the discovery of the first endogenous cannabinoid (endocannabinoid), anandamide (arachidonoyl ethanolamide). Later on other endocannabinoids were found, for example 2-AG (2-arachidonoyl glycerol). These findings raised further questions about the pharmacological and physiological role of the cannabinoid system. This revived the research on cannabinoid receptor antagonists which were expected to help answer these questions. The use of the cannabinoid agonist, THC, in its many preparations to enhance appetite is a well known fact. This fact led to the logical extension that blocking of the cannabinoid receptors might be useful in decreasing appetite and food intake. It was then discovered that the blockage of the CB1 receptor represented a new pharmacological target. The first specific CB1 receptor antagonist / inverse agonist was rimonabant, discovered in 1994. ==Endocannabinoids and their signaling system== The endogenous cannabinoid system includes cannabinoid receptors, their endogenous ligands (endocannabinoids) and enzymes for their synthesis and degradation. There are two main receptor types associated with the endocannabinoid signaling system: cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) and 2 (CB2). Both receptors are 7-transmembrane G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) which inhibit the accumulation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate within cells. CB1 receptors are present in highest concentration in the brain but can also be found in the periphery. CB2 receptors are mostly located in the immune and haematopoietic systems. Endocannabinoids are eicosanoids acting as agonists for cannabinoid receptors, and they occur naturally in the body. Cannabinoid receptor-related processes are, for example, involved in cognition; memory; anxiety; control of appetite; emesis; motor behavior; sensory, autonomic, neuroendocrine, and immune responses; and inflammatory effects. There are two well-characterized endocannabinoids located in the brain and periphery. The first identified was anandamide (arachidonoyl ethanolamide), and the second was 2-AG (2-arachidonoyl glycerol). Additional endocannabinoids include virodhamine (O-arachidonoyl ethanolamine), noladin ether (2-arachidonoyl glyceryl ether) and NADA (N-arachidonoyl dopamine). ==Mechanism of action== Figure 1 Hypothetical model for the metabolic effects of CB1 receptor antagonists. (ECS=endocannabinoid system) CB1 receptors are coupled through Gi/o proteins and inhibit adenylyl cyclase and activate mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase. In addition, CB1 receptors inhibit presynaptic N- and P/Q-type calcium channels and activate inwardly rectifying potassium channels. CB1 antagonists produce inverse cannabimimetic effects that are opposite in direction from those produced by agonists for these receptors. CB1 receptors are highly expressed in hypothalamic areas which are involved in central food intake control and feeding behavior. This strongly indicates that the cannabinoid system is directly involved in feeding regulation. These regions are also interconnected with the mesolimbic dopamine pathway, the so-called \\"reward\\" system. Therefore, CB1 antagonists might indirectly inhibit the dopamine-mediated rewarding properties of food. Peripheral CB1 receptors are located in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, liver and in adipose tissue. In the GI, CB1 receptors are located on nerve terminals in the intestines. Endocannabinoids act at the CB1 receptors to increase hunger and promote feeding and it is speculated that they decrease intestinal peristalsis and gastric emptying. Thus, antagonism at these receptors can inverse these effects. Also, in peripheral tissues, antagonism of CB1 receptors increases insulin sensitivity and oxidation of fatty acids in muscles and the liver. A hypothetical scheme for the metabolic effects of CB1 receptor antagonists is shown in Figure 1. ==Drug design== The first approach to develop cannabinoid antagonists in the late 1980s was to modify the structure of THC, but the results were disappointing. In the early 1990s new family of cannabinoid agonists was discovered from the NSAID (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory) drug pravadoline which led to the discovery of aminoalkyl indole antagonists with some but limited success. As the search based on the structure of agonists was disappointing it was no surprise that the first potent and selective cannabinoid antagonist belonged to an entirely new chemical family. In 1994 the first selective cannabinoid antagonist, SR141716 (rimonabant), was introduced by Sanofi belonging to a family of 1,5-diarylpyrazoles. ===Rimonabant=== Figure 2 Chemical structure of rimonabant Figure 3 Schematic representation of the two state-model of CB1 receptor activation, in which receptors are in equilibrium between two states, active and inactive (R* and R) Figure 4 A general CB1 receptor inverse agonist pharmacophore model. Putative CB1 receptor amino acid side chain residues in receptor-ligand interaction are shown. Rimonabant is taken as a representative example below. The applied colors indicate the mutual properties with the general CB1 pharmacophore Rimonabant, also known by the systematic name [N-(piperidin-1-yl)-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamidehydrochloride)], is a 1,5-diarylpyrazole CB1 receptor antagonist (Figure 2). Rimonabant is not only a potent and highly selective ligand of the CB1 receptor, but it is also orally active and antagonizes most of the effects of cannabinoid agonists, such as THC, both in vitro and in vivo. Rimonabant has shown clear clinical efficacy for the treatment of obesity. ===Binding=== Binding of an agonist ligand to the CB1 receptor provokes a conformational change and leads to the active state of the receptor which is responsible for the signal transduction. However, there is an additional mechanism that can lead to the active state in the absence of ligand. As numerous other GPCRs, CB1 receptor displays a high level of constitutive activity and thus it can spontaneously adopt an active conformational state in the absence of agonist binding, keeping elevated basal levels of intracellular signaling. This can be explained by the two state- model of receptor activation in which receptors are in equilibrium between two states, active and inactive (R* and R). An agonist will stabilize the active state leading to activation, a neutral antagonist binds equally to active and inactive states, whereas an inverse agonist will preferentially stabilize the inactive state (Figure 3). Rimonabant has been reported in many cases to behave as an inverse agonist rather than as a neutral antagonist and it is likely that it binds preferentially to the inactive state of the CB1, thereby decreasing the activation of the signaling pathway. The key binding interaction is a hydrogen bond formed between the carbonyl group of rimonabant and the Lys192 residue of the CB1 receptor. This bond stabilizes the Lys192-Asp366 salt bridge of the intracellular end of transmembrane helices 3 and 6 (Figure 4). This specific salt bridge is present in the inactive state of the receptor but absent in the active state. In the inactive state of CB1 rimonabant binds within the transmembrane-3-4-5-6 aromatic microdomain. The binding of rimonabant involves direct aromatic stacking interactions between its 2,4-dichlorophenyl ring and the Trp279/Phe200/Trp356 residues on the one side and the para-chlorophenyl ring and the Tyr275/Trp255/Phe278 residues on the other side. The lipophilic piperidinyl moiety fits nicely in a cavity formed by the amino acid residues Val196/Phe170/Leu387 and Met384 (Figure 4). ===Pharmacophore=== Most CB1 antagonists reported so far are close analogs or isosteres of rimonabant. A general CB1 inverse agonist pharmacophore model can be extracted from the common features of these analogs, diarylpyrazoles (Figure 4). This pharmacophore contains a cyclic core, C, (e.g. pyrazole in rimonabant) substituted by two aromatic moieties, A and B. A hydrogen bond acceptor unit, D, connects C with a cyclic lipophilic part, E. In some cases unit E directly connects to C. In Figure 4 rimonabant is used as an example. Unit A represents a 4-chlorophenyl group and unit B a 2,4-dichlorophenyl ring. Unit C is the central pyrazole ring and unit D represents the carbonyl group which serves as the hydrogen bond acceptor. Unit E represents a lipophilic aminopiperidinyl moiety. ===Structure-activity relationships=== Optimal binding at the CB1 receptor requires a para-substituted phenyl ring at the pyrazole 5-position. The 5-substituent of the pyrazole is involved in receptor recognition and antagonism. The para-substituent of the phenyl ring could be chlorine, bromine or iodine, but it has been shown that an alkyl chain could also be tolerated. Numbering of the central pyrazole ring is shown in Figure 2. A 2,4-dichloro-substituted phenyl ring at the pyrazole 1-position is preferred for affinity as well as for the activity. It has been shown that additional halogens on this phenyl ring decrease affinity. It is also favorable to have a ring substitution at the 3-carboxamide group, such as the 1-piperidinyl group in rimonabant. Replacement of the amino piperidinyl substituent by alkyl amides, ethers, ketones, alcohols or alkanes resulted mostly in decreased affinity. Replacement of the piperidinyl by pentyl or a heptyl chain gave the compounds agonistic properties. Based on these results it was concluded that the pyrazole 3-position seems to be involved in agonism, while the 1-,4-,5-positions appear to be involved in antagonism. Research has shown that the absence of the carboxamide oxygen results in decreased affinity. Furthermore, the presence of carboxamide oxygen contributes in conferring the inverse agonist properties, whereas analogs lacking this oxygen are found to be neutral antagonists. These results support the hypothesis that the carboxamide oxygen forms a hydrogen bond with Lys192 residue at the CB1 receptor. ===Diarylpyrazole derivatives=== SR141716 (rimonabant) analogs have recently been described by several groups, leading to a good understanding of the structure-activity relationship (SAR) within this chemical group. While most compounds described are less potent than SR141716, two of them are worth mentioning, SR147778 and AM251, although both may have action at mu opioid receptors as well.\\"AM-251 and rimonabant act as direct antagonists at mu- opioid receptors: implications for opioid/cannabinoid interaction studies.\\", Neuropharmacology. 2012 Oct;63(5):905-15. doi: 10.1016/j.neuropharm.2012.06.046. Epub 2012 Jul 4. SR147778 (surinabant), a second generation antagonist, has a longer duration of action than rimonabant and enhanced oral activity. This enhanced duration of action is probably due to the presence of the more metabolically stable ethyl group at the 4-position of its pyrazole ring. Another change is the replacement of the 5-phenyl chlorine substituent by bromine. The diarylpyrazole derivative, AM251, has been described where chlorine substituent has been replaced by iodine in the para position of the 5-phenyl ring. This derivative appeared to be more potent and selective than rimonabant. 21 analogs possessing either an alkyl amide or an alkyl hydrazide of variant lengths in position 3 were synthesized. It was observed that affinity increases with increased carbon chain length up to five carbons. Also the amide analogs exhibited higher affinity than hydrazide analogs. However, none of these analogs possessed significantly greater affinity than rimonabant but nevertheless, they were slightly more selective than rimonabant for the CB1 receptor over the CB2 receptor. Several attempts have been made to increase the affinity of the diarylpyrazole derivatives by rigidifying the structure of rimonabant. In terms of the general pharmacophore model the units A, B and/or C are connected by additional bonds leading to rigid molecules. For example, the condensed polycyclic pyrazole NESS-0327 showed 5000 times more affinity for the CB1 receptor than rimonabant. However, this compound possesses a poor central bioavailability. Another compound, the indazole derivative O-1248, can be regarded as an analog of rimonabant wherein its 5-aryl group is fused to the pyrazole moiety. However, this structural modification resulted in a 67-fold decrease in CB1 receptor affinity. These diarylpyrazole derivatives of rimonabant are summarized in Table 1. {  border=\\"1\\" +Table 1 Diarylpyrazole derivatives of rimonabant - 200x200px 200x200px - SR147778 AM251 - 200x200px 200x200px - NESS-0327 O-1248 } ===Other derivatives=== Structurally different from the 1,5-diarylpyrazoles are the chemical series of the 3,4-diarylpyrazolines. Within this series is SLV-319 (ibipinabant), a potent CB1 antagonist which is about 1000-fold more selective for CB1 compared with CB2 and displays in vivo activity similar to rimonabant. Another approach used to develop analogs of rimonabant was to replace central pyrazole ring by another heterocycle. An example of this approach are 4,5-diarylimidazoles and 1,5-diarylpyrrole-3-carboxamides. A large number of fused bicyclic derivatives of diaryl-pyrazole and imidazoles have been reported. An example of these is a purine derivative where a pyrimidine ring is fused to an imidazole ring. Otenabant (CP-945,598) is an example of a fused bicyclic derivative developed by Pfizer. Several research groups have studied six-membered ring pyrazole bioisosteres. For example, one 2,3-diarylpyridine derivative was shown to be potent and selective CB1 inverse agonist. The structure of this compound demonstrates the possibility that the amide moiety of rimonabant could be split into a lipophilic (benzyloxy) and a polar (nitrile) functionality. Other six-membered ring analogs are for example pyrimidines and pyrazines. In addition to the five and six-membered ring analogs there are other cyclic derivatives such as the azetidines. One example is the methylsulfonamide azetidine derivative which has a 1,1-diaryl group that mimics the 1,5-diaryl moiety of the diarylpyrazoles. The sulfonyl group serves as a hydrogen bond acceptor. The 1,1-diaryl group is also present in derivatives such as the benzodioxoles and hydantoins. Acyclic analogs have also been reported. These analogs contain a 1,2-diaryl motif which corresponds to the 1,5-diaryl substituents of rimonabant. An example of an acyclic analog is taranabant (MK-0364) developed by Merck. Representatives of these analogs are summarized in Table 2. {  border=\\"1\\" +Table 2 Representatives of non- diarylpyrazole derivatives -  200x200px 200x200px 200x200px - Type of derivative 3,4-Diarylpyrazoline (Ibipinabant) 4,5-Diarylimidazole 1,5-Diarylpyrrole-3-carboxamides -  200x200px 200x200px 200x200px - Type of derivative Purine (pyrimidine ring fused to an imidazole ring)  Purine derivative (Otenabant) 2,3-Diarylpyridine -  200x200px 200x200px 200x200px - Type of derivative Pyrimidine Pyrazine Methylsulfonamide azetidine -  200x200px 200x200px 200x200px - Type of derivative Benzodioxole Hydantoin Acyclic derivative (Taranabant) } ===CB1 receptor antibodies=== Antibodies against the CB1 receptor have been developed and introduced into clinical use in Russia. They include brizantin (¬Æ) and dietressa (¬Æ). Brizantin is indicated for the treatment of nicotine withdrawal and smoking cessation and dietressa is indicated for weight loss. Dietressa is available over-the-counter in Russia. ==Current status== Rimonabant (Acomplia) has been approved in the European Union (EU) since June 2006 for the treatment of obesity. On 23 October 2008 the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) has recommended the suspension of the marketing authorization across the EU for Acomplia from Sanofi-Aventis based on the risk of serious psychiatric disorders. On 5 November 2008 Sanofi- Aventis announced discontinuation of rimonabant clinical development program. Sanofi-Aventis has also discontinued development of surinabant (SR147778), a CB1 receptor antagonist for smoking cessation (31 October 2008).http://www.sanofi- aventis.ca/live/ca/medias/DA924A61-8E54-4D1D-B1FB-71C953E398C2.pdf Merck has stated in its press release on 2 October 2008 that they will not seek regulatory approval for taranabant (MK-0364) to treat obesity and will discontinue its Phase III clinical development program. Data from Phase III clinical trial showed that greater efficacy and more adverse effects were associated with the higher doses of taranabant and it was determined that the overall profile of taranabant does not support further development for obesity. Another pharmaceutical company, Pfizer, terminated the Phase III development program for its obesity compound otenabant (CP-945,598), a selective antagonist of the CB1 receptor. According to Pfizer their decision was based on changing regulatory perspectives on the risk/benefit profile of the CB1 class and likely new regulatory requirements for approval.http://www.pfizer.com/news/press_releases/pfizer_press_releases.jsp?rssUrl=http://mediaroom.pfizer.com/portal/site/pfizer/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&ndmConfigId;=1010794&newsId;=20081105006339&newsLang;=en A number of initiatives have been published to develop CB1 antagonists that target only peripheral CB1 receptors by restricting their ability to cross the blood brain barrier. Among these initiatives 7TM Pharma has reported the development of TM38837. A review has now published on the approaches and compounds being pursued as peripherally restricted CB1 receptor blockers. ==See also== * Endocannabinoid enhancer * Endocannabinoid reuptake inhibitor ==References== Category:Drug discovery ","title":"Cannabinoid receptor antagonist"},{"id":"20207599","text":"Sir William Purdie Treloar, 1st Baronet (13 January 1843 ‚Äì 6 September 1923) was an English businessman who was Sheriff of London in 1889‚Äì1900 and Lord Mayor of London in 1906‚Äì1907.

He was the second cousin of Henry de Vere, 18th Earl of Oxford. When Henry died some time between 2 and 9 June 1625, Robert emerged as the heir apparent to the earldom. Robert's claim was by his descent from the 15th Earl of Oxford, but his title was not immediately confirmed, although his right to the peerage was acknowledged by the Lord Chief Justice, Sir Ranulph Crewe in his celebrated \\"Time hath his revolutions\\" judgment. He was considered to have an inadequate estate in England, and only after a long debate in the House of Lords in April 1626 did he eventually secure his title and right to attend Parliament. He subsequently returned to his home in the Low Countries, where he had made a career for himself as a soldier in the Dutch army. He married Beatrice, or Bauck, daughter of the Dutch nobleman Sierck van Hemmema. In 1632, Robert was killed while taking part in the siege of Maastricht. His title passed to his five-year-old son Aubrey, who would in turn become the last in an almost 600-year line of de Vere earls of Oxford. ==AncestryReferences== Category:1575 births Category:1632 deaths Category:16th-century English nobility Category:17th-century English nobility Robert de Vere, 19th Earl Robert ","title":"Robert de Vere, 19th Earl of Oxford"}]`),I={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:P},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:B}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},R={class:"card-container"};function H(s,a,o,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return t(),n(h,null,[a[1]||(a[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâLife Quotesü•≥")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",R,[(t(!0),n(h,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,g)=>(t(),b(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:a[0]||(a[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):w("",!0)])],64)}const L=d(I,[["render",H]]),x=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/2.md","filePath":"quotes/2.md"}'),D={name:"quotes/2.md"},N=Object.assign(D,{setup(s){return(a,o)=>(t(),n("div",null,[v(L)]))}});export{x as __pageData,N as default};
