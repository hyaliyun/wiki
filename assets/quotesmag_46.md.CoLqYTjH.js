She married Suharto on 26 December 1947 in Surakarta using a traditional Javanese ceremony. The Javanese custom was for the bride's family to pay the bulk of the wedding costs. Suharto apparently drove there in a battered De Soto sedan. Suharto stated that the marriage was initially not one of romantic love, but they did eventually grow to love each other devotedly, a type of marriage that was very common for many Javanese of that era. Three days after their marriage, Siti Hartinah was taken by Suharto to live in his Yogyakarta house at Jalan Merbabu 2. Her marriage was initiated by Suharto's foster mother at the time, Ibu (Mrs) Prawirowiharjo, who sought an audience with her mother. Ibu Prawirowiharjo cultivated a close relationship with her mother, a family in Suharto's own words as \\"well regarded and respected in the city of Solo\\"Elson, 22 Siti Hartinah became known in Indonesia as \\"Madame Tien\\".

Some accomplishments during his brief term included expanding Maine's sales tax to fund the formation of consolidated school districts, instituting a 3% lodging tax for school funding, the first open meetings law in Maine, and expanding the powers of judges in state municipal courts, which led to the formation of the District Court system two years after his death. ==Death== Clauson died in his sleep on December 30, 1959 before he could finish out his term.https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/57361585/ He is buried in Pine Grove Cemetery.https://www.centralmaine.com/2013/11/03/interest_in_waterville_s_first_murder_renewed_/ Clauson was succeeded by the President of the Maine Senate, John H. Reed. Reed, a Republican, was subsequently elected governor after a special election. In 1961, the Maine Legislature voted to name two bridges over the Kennebec River in Fairfield on the then-under construction Interstate 95 the Clinton A. Clauson Memorial Bridges. The bridges were completed in 1964 and rehabilitated from 2013 to 2014. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:1895 births Category:1959 deaths Category:American chiropractors Category:People from Mitchell County, Iowa Category:Mayors of Waterville, Maine Category:Governors of Maine Category:Maine Democrats Category:Democratic Party state governors of the United States Category:20th-century American politicians Category:People who died in office ","title":"Clinton Clauson"},{"id":"12360904","text":"Herold may refer to: ==Places== * Herold, Germany * Herold, Western Cape, South Africa * Herold, West Virginia * Herold, Wisconsin ==Other uses== *Herold (surname) *Herold (beer), made in Prague, Czech Republic * various newspapers, including: **Milwaukee Herold, daily and weekly ","title":"Herold"},{"id":"12360912","text":"Bourchier is an English surname, from French Boursier, keeper of the purse.

He won the bronze medal in the men's middleweight division (- 86 kg) in Seoul, South Korea (1988), alongside Akinobu Osako from Japan. In 1995, Spijkers tried his hand at mixed martial arts competition by competing in the World Combat Championship and Shooto events. ==Mixed martial arts career== Spijkers had his MMA debut in the Japanese promotion Shooto against the veteran Erik Paulson. Cornered by Gerard Gordeau, Ben rushed Paulson through the fight with multiple takedown attempts, along with brawling style punches and some hip tosses which connected. However, Erik showed a proficient defense and superior striking, and the fight went outside the ring when the two fell between the ropes and later when Paulson threw Spijkers outside. Ending came at the fifth round when Paulson avoided another takedown attempt and locked a guillotine choke, making Spijkers tap. Ben's second, and last, MMA fight would be at World Combat Championships (WCC), facing Brazilian jiu-jitsu stylist Renzo Gracie at the first round. Started the match, the judogi-clad Spijkers got a morote gari, but Gracie swept him back to standing and executed his own takedown. Ben tried to counter on the ground with a gi choke, but Renzo took his back and delivered some elbow strikes to the base of the skull before submitting him. Upon the ending of the battle Gracie stepped on the back of Spijkers's head, though later apologized for his unsporting actions. On his return flight to the Netherlands afterwards, Ben was arrested after a dispute with an airline stewardess regarding his carry on baggage.

The coherence of the image got lost because of the relative movement (a function of the wavelength of the signal and the swell) of the source and receiver during the recording. In normal seismic recordings, the term swell filter refers to filtering the acoustic noise, created by waves, out of the seismic recording. ==High resolution seismics and subbottom profiling== Very high resolution seismics (reflection seismology) is applied to make detailed acoustic profiles of a sea floor or lake floor. Acoustic sources used include: air gun, water gun, sleeve gun, sparker and boomer. The frequency used in this field ranges from 100 Hz to 10.000 Hz. Subbottom profiling is a technique used in acoustical oceanography. Sonars or echo sounder are typical sources for very high resolution imaging. Also used in this field are parametric echosounders. The main difference with the high resolution seismics is the type of source used. ==Problematic swell== When the movement of the platform and equipment due to swell is too heavy during a seismic recording, the coherence of the image gets lost. The reason why it gets lost is because the movement of source and receiver is larger than the wavelength of the signal produced by the source. As such the seismic reflectors do not line up.

Based on original examinations and the publication of archives, 'Gradhiva was open to a variety of disciplines: ethnology, aesthetics, history, art history, sociology, literature and even music.

As a child, he grew up in a horrific setting; caught in between violence, pornography, alcohol and crime. His father had a history of being arrested for assaulting his mother. One afternoon, his father caught his mother cheating on him and responded to the incident by killing the family's dog. As a result, his defense attorney, Steven L. Harris, stated, \\"that's all he's known since the day he was born\\". \\"'There's times when I can remember my mother pulling a gun out on my dad and trying to shoot him,'\\" Judy recalled. As a child, Judy was caught burning down a neighbor's garage and stabbing a classmate with a pair of compasses. When he was 10 years old, he started to pursue high school females. He would push them to the ground and molest them. At the age of 13, Judy pretended to be a Boy Scout, forced himself into a woman's home, raped her, and then tried to kill her with a pocketknife. The pocketknife broke before he could kill the woman. However, he fractured her skull and cut off one of her fingers. At the trial, Judy initially claimed he had nothing to do with it. Once the investigators brought up his past incidents, he pled insanity. He was found guilty and sentenced to six months in a juvenile detention center and was then sent to a mental hospital. At the hospital he received treatment for his diagnosis as a \\"sexual psychopath\\". Once released, Judy was placed into foster care and sent to live with Robert and Mary Carr who were uninformed about Judy's history. The primary crime Judy committed occurred when he was 23 years old. On Saturday, April 28, 1979, Terry Lee Chasteen was on her way to drop her children off at a babysitter's house before going to work. While on the road, Judy passed her car and gave her a sign that indicated that she needed to pull over. She eventually did and instantly accepted help from Judy, who she thought was just being a Good Samaritan. He told her that something was \\"wrong\\" with her tire and offered to fix it. While \\"fixing\\" her tire, he disabled her car and offered Terry and her three children a ride. He instantly drove his new passengers to White Lick Creek,White Lick Creek where his victims were found. Once at the Creek, Judy directed the three children to a path, having them walk ahead of him and their mother, Terry. Once the children were ahead of them, Judy raped Terry, tied her hands and feet, and began choking her. Terry began screaming for help and her children ran back up to them. They screamed and cried as Judy raped her. Later that day, police officers discovered Terry and her three children, Misty (5 years old), Stephen (4 years old), and Mark (2 years old). Evidence was found that Terry had died from being strangled, while the children were drowned. Several witnesses eventually came forward to help the police piece together who the murderer was. The arrest of Judy triggered an emotional outcry that lasted two years. He pled insanity and confessed to committing the murders. While in the \\"punishment phase\\" of the trial, Judy wanted it to be fast-paced so \\"he threatened the judge and jury and promised to kill again unless they sentenced him to death.\\" The trial ended with Judy being found guilty and then executed on March 9, 1981, aged 24, in Michigan City, Indiana in the electric chair.

The show debuted on September 10, 2007, two months after Wilkos' departure as director of security on The Jerry Springer Show. ==History== The show has Wilkos expanding on his Steve to the Rescue shows that he did while serving as a co-host for Jerry Springer whenever Springer took breaks or was doing other projects, such as Dancing with the Stars. The idea of Wilkos having his own show came as a result of this approach, which proved to be so popular with viewers that the producers of Springer pitched the idea of giving Wilkos his own show to NBCUniversal, which proved successful. On his show, each episode of the show focuses on the topics usually addressed by this type of talk show, mainly involving adultery, domestic abuse, paternity, disrespectful children and teenage pregnancy, with other topics of the same genre also covered often. As noted, Wilkos' show takes a darker tone and deals with more serious topics than Springer's usually covered, most involving criminal justice issues. Wilkos will often refuse to allow guests accused of excessively heinous misbehavior, such as being convicted of certain crimes (especially sex offenses and spousal/child abuse) to sit down in the chairs on his soundstage. Wilkos will sometimes toss these chairs aside when he is angry (and at times he has also thrown the chairs, thereby breaking them). He often notes in his show that the reason he does so is that when the accused committed the crime against the victim, they weren't making them \\"comfortable\\" and as such, they don't deserve to be \\"comfortable\\" while on his show. Irrespective of any heinous behavior, Wilkos typically lets pregnant women and teenagers sit on his stage. A trademark of the show is Wilkos' chair-throwing. When angry, he often picks up and throws chairs, usually breaking them (in one notable instance during the first season, rather than breaking, a chair he threw got wedged into the wall), and often stating that he would like to do the same to his guests.Memories from 1000 Shows: Throwing Chairs - YouTube Despite lack of evidence of their efficacy, (Chapter 8: Conclusions and Recommendations, p. 212) polygraph exams are commonly used on the show as a means for resolving issues. Often guests are polygraphed in regards to cases of physical abuse, child molestation, rape, murder, and infidelity. When the results of a polygraph are disputed by an accused guest, Wilkos brings out the production's polygraph expert, Daniel Ribacoff (who has been on the show since the third season) to explicate the results. Guests usually take the polygraph exam three times or more.Stevewilkos.com The show also focuses on clearing the names of those who are wrongfully accused and/or convicted of serious offenses such as rape, abuse, murder, and other offenses of that nature. If the accused passes their lie detector test, Steve often turns his anger towards the accusers the same way he expresses anger at those who are guilty of committing those offenses. Wilkos has appeared twice on Maury; once in 2008, and participated in the 2,500th episode in 2013.TV Guide On November 22, 2013, The Steve Wilkos Show celebrated its 1000th episode, along with Jerry Springer and Rachelle Wilkos as special guests. The 1,000th episode took a look back on the first seven of the ten seasons of the show. The Steve Wilkos Show celebrated its tenth anniversary in September 2016. Steve Wilkos and Rachelle Wilkos, as well as the producers, hosted a series of tributes entitled \\"A Decade of Steve\\", looking back on the first nine seasons of the show. ==Changes== In the second season, Wilkos began dividing some episodes into two segments, each one dealing with different guests and issues. In rare cases, there can be three segments on one episode. Additionally, paternity tests and infidelity were added as topics to the show. As time went on with the paternity and infidelity stories, Wilkos would often make jokes with guests just to get laughs from himself, his guests and the audience, since paternity and infidelity aren't as serious an offense as abuse of any kind. According to the Chicago Sun-Times, executive producer Richard Dominick was forced from the program by Springer and NBCU Domestic Television after encouraging Wilkos to become extremely physical with a guest. Rachelle Wilkos, Wilkos's wife and a long time Springer crew member, became the program's executive producer. Wilkos' third season premiered September 14, 2009, originating from the Stamford Media Center in Stamford, Connecticut complete with a new studio. Fellow NBC-Universal talkers Maury and Springer made the move, as well.The new studio - Steve Wilkos In June 2018, it was announced that the show had been renewed through 2020. In March 2020, NBCUniversal Television Distribution announced that The Steve Wilkos Show had been renewed for two additional seasons. ==Notable episodes== Some episodes of the show have led to guests being arrested or convicted of sexual crimes. * In November 2011, Norwich, Connecticut police arrested Burke Bergman after he failed a lie detector test about sexually molesting his son, in the episode \\"Three Possible Dads, One Possible Molester\\" aired on September 19, 2011. * Five months following the October 3, 2012 episode \\"Did You Rape My Daughter?\\", guest Shaun Whitt was arrested in Flagler County, Florida on charges of raping his then-11-year-old step-daughter beginning in 2010.

He had the photos taken in March 1871 to post home to Wales in explanation of the life he was leading. Each role was amplified by an accompanying descriptive poem of over 20 lines. Joseph Jenkins (27 February 1818 ‚Äì 26 September 1898), was an educated tenant farmer from Tregaron, Ceredigion, mid-Wales who, when aged over 50, suddenly deserted his home and large family to seek his fortune in Australia. The Australian Dictionary of Biography says that \\"Jenkins's noteworthiness stemmed from the rich documentation of his experiences and thoughts that has survived\\". He was a consistent diarist for 58 years of his life and a consistent if not outstanding poet, under the bardic name Amnon II. He achieved fame posthumously from publication of some excerpts of his Australian writings. The compiler, his grandson Dr William Evans, a Harley Street cardiologist, coined the title Diary of a Welsh SwagmanEvans, William Diary of a Welsh Swagman (Macmillan, Melbourne 1975, reprinted by Sun Books 1977‚Äì ) by which name he is familiar to generations of Victorian school students for whom the book became a prescribed history text in 1978.Phillips, Bethan Pity the Swagman (Cymdeithas Lifrau Ceredigion Gyf., Aberystwyth 2002) ==Early life and education== Joseph Jenkins was born at Blaenplwyf farm near Ystrad Aeron in Ceredigion, Wales. He was the fourth child of 12 brought up by Jenkin Jenkins and Eleanor (n√©e Davies).Jenkins D. and Lewis D. Cerddi Cerngoch Caxton Hall, Lampeter, 1904. (See section Bucheddau (Lives), p lxx.) In 1846 he married his second cousin Elisabeth (Betty) Evans of Tynant. They purchased the lease of Trecefel farm, Tregaron and had nine children, the last of whom, John David, was born in April 1868. He commenced education under a disciplinarian private tutor and later attended a small Unitarian church school at Cribyn, a five- mile walk from home. Throughout his life, Joseph bewailed his lack of more formal education. However, his thirst for knowledge, religious temperament and passion for reading and writing proved a firm basis for continuing self- education. ==Agricultural skills== Under his management, Trecefel won many prizes in agricultural shows and its cattle fetched top prices in the market. In 1851, it was judged to be the best farm in the county. In 1861, Joseph was appointed to adjudicate the same competition. > Joseph Jenkins favoured the rotation system of growing crops, spoke against > deep ploughing, favoured thorough harrowing, and was a strong advocate of > the virtue of feeding the soil with farmyard manure. In his writings > appearing in farming journals, he emphasised the importance of harvesting > young hay, and preparing lucerne and clover crops to provide fodder for > cattle during a severe and prolonged frost in winter and periods of drought > in summer. . . ==Diaries== Joseph Jenkins‚Äìphoto taken in Wales around 1896‚Äì97 Joseph Jenkins consistently maintained a diary of daily events for 58 years. Though he was a native Welsh speaker, he penned the diaries in English as an aid to self- education. His biographer, Bethan Phillips, wrote in her foreword: > . . . The diaries reveal him as a man seeking to exorcise his own demons by > attempting to escape from them, but they also reveal him as an astute > observer of the people and occurrences impacting upon his own eventful life. > His dogged determination in keeping a daily journal, often under the most > difficult of circumstances and in the most unpropitious surroundings, has > given us a uniquely valuable historical record of life in the nineteenth > century. Wales The first entry was on New Year's Day, 1839. Though he continued to record each day, much of the early record has been lost. The earliest complete year extant is 1845. Manuscripts for the years 1839‚Äì1868 and 1895‚Äì1898 (when he lived in Wales) are held by the National Library of Wales at Aberystwyth, together with his shipboard diary of the voyage from Liverpool to Melbourne. Australia 24 November 1878 diary entry written by Joseph Jenkins while in Castlemaine Hospital Centenary plaque at Maldon railway station The Australian diaries which were acquired in 1997 by the State Library of Victoria, Melbourne, cover the years 1869‚Äì1894. Joseph Jenkins disembarked from the iron-hulled schooner Eurynome at the Melbourne port of Hobson's Bay on 12 March 1869.This date is given in Joseph's shipboard log. In later diaries, he wrongly recalled it as 22 MarchThe Eurynome's arrival is reported in Shipping Intelligence: Hobson's Bay: Arrived March 12 The Argus, 13 March 1869, at Trove The Eurynome was an 1163-ton sailing vessel transporting casks of beer to Australia on the clipper route, with 12 passengers in a first-class saloon and 21 (including Joseph) who paid a much lower price to share frugal and unhygienic steerage accommodation on the voyage of 140 days, including three terrifying weeks of gales in the Roaring Forties. The following month's diary shows him carrying his swag, pessimistically prospecting and offering rural labour in and around the goldfields town of Castlemaine where he found many fellow Welshmen. He rarely left this vicinity except to attend the annual St David's Day eisteddfod at Ballarat where, on thirteen consecutive occasions, he was awarded the premier prize for an englyn (Welsh verse form). Joseph obtained regular employment in 1884 as a cleaner of streets and drains in the town of Maldon, a few miles north from Castlemaine. He remained there working until he reached the age of 76 and became homesick for Wales. Having saved the fare, he departed Maldon by rail on 23 November 1894, and embarked on the ss Ophir which docked at Tilbury docks on 5 January 1895. In 1994 a water drinking fountain and a plaque were erected at Maldon railway station to recognise the centenary of Joseph Jenkins's departure and his unique record of the life of a rural worker in Victoria. His own words were cited: Through this [diary] I am building. . . my own monument (pictured at right). ==Return and controversy== On returning to Wales, he entrusted the diaries to his daughter Elinor (Nell) who stored them in the attic of her home, Tyndomen farm, near Tregaron. They came to light some 70 years later when a great-granddaughter, Frances Evans, recovered and protected them, permitting her uncle, Dr William Evans to read and edit the contents. Destruction of the diaries had been favoured by some family members who were concerned by their potential to arouse adverse reflection on reputations, especially that of Joseph's wife, Betty, whose alleged infidelity and at least one specific physical assault on him by her and others: [26 May 1868] . . . my ribs and breastbone were fractured . . . I have an ugly black eye with about a dozen other different wounds. were consistently blamed by him as the cause of his leaving home. However, no conclusive evidence has emerged that Betty was other than a loyal and capable wife‚Äîand one who may herself have had good reason to find fault with Joseph's own personality and behaviour. E.g., in Pity the Swagman, Bethan Phillips argues that Joseph drank excessively while at home, though he generally abstained in Australia, and that he became disliked by neighbours for actively supporting landowners and their politicians at a time when they were oppressing many tenant-farmers‚Äìwho were consequently promoting liberal candidates. ==Historical studies== In 1904 a body of information with a photograph of Joseph and a selection of his poetry in Welsh was included in the book Cerddi Cerngoch by Daniel Jenkins and David Lewis. (The title is Welsh for 'Poems of Redcheek'‚Äîthe bardic name of Joseph's brother John‚Äîbut the book also records writings of several other distinguished family members.) Most of the book is printed in the Welsh language but some prefatory pages are in English. In 1998, Dr Bethan Phillips of Lampeter, having devoted many years to the project, including a visit to Australia, published her extensively researched account in Welsh: Rhwng Dau Fyd: Y Swagman O Geredigion, followed in 2002 by Pity the Swagman‚ÄîThe Australian Odyssey of a Victorian Diarist. ==References and sourcesFurther reading== * Jones, Bill.

It was the first type I toxin-antitoxin pair to be identified through characterisation of a plasmid-stabilising locus. It is a type I system because the toxin is neutralised by a complementary RNA, rather than a partnered protein (type II toxin-antitoxin). The conserved secondary structure of sok non-coding RNA transcript which binds with hok mRNA. ==Genes involved== The hok/sok system involves three genes: * hok, host killing - a long lived (half-life 20 minutes) toxin * sok, suppression of killing - a short lived (half-life 30 seconds) RNA antitoxin * mok, modulation of killing - required for hok translation ==Killing mechanism== When E. coli undergoes cell division, the two daughter cells inherit the long-lived hok toxin from the parent cell. Due to the short half-life of the sok antitoxin, daughter cells inherit only small amounts and it quickly degrades. If a daughter cell has inherited the R1 plasmid, it has inherited the sok gene and a strong promoter which brings about high levels of transcription. So much so that in an R1-positive cell, Sok transcript exists in considerable molar excess over Hok mRNA. Sok RNA then indirectly inhibits the translation of hok by inhibiting mok translation. There is a complementary region where sok transcript binds hok mRNA directly (pictured), but it does not occlude the Shine-Dalgarno sequence. Instead, sok RNA regulates the translation of the mok open reading frame, which nearly entirely overlaps that of hok. It is this translation-coupling which effectively allows sok RNA to repress the translation of hok mRNA. The sok transcript forms a duplex with the leader region of hok mRNA and this is recognized by RNase III and degraded. The cleavage products are very unstable and soon decay. 400px400px Daughter cells without a copy of the R1 plasmid die because they do not have the means to produce more sok antitoxin transcript to inhibit translation of the inherited hok mRNA. The killing system is said to be postsegregational (PSK), since cell death occurs after segregation of the plasmid. ==Hok toxin== The hok gene codes for a 52 amino acid toxic protein which causes cell death by depolarization of the cell membrane. It works in a similar way to holin proteins which are produced by bacteriophages before cell lysis. ==Homologous systems== Other plasmids hok/sok homologues denoted flmA/B (FlmA is the protein toxin and FlmB RNA the antisense regulator) are carried on the F plasmid which operate in the same way to maintain the stability of the plasmid. The F plasmid contains another homologous toxin-antitoxin system called srnB. The first type I toxin-antitoxin system to be found in gram- positive bacteria is the RNAI-RNAII system of the pAD1 plasmid in Enterococcus faecalis. Here, RNAI encodes a toxic protein Fst while RNAII is the regulatory sRNA. Chromosomal toxin-antitoxin systems In E. coli strain K-12 there are four long direct repeats (ldr) which encode short open reading frames of 35 codons organised in a homologous manner to the hok/sok system. One of the repeats encodes LdrD, a toxic protein which causes cell death. An unstable antisense RNA regulator (Rd1D) blocks the translation of the LdrD transcript. A mok homologue which overlaps each ldr loci has also been found. IstR RNA works in a similar system in conjunction with the toxic TisB protein. ==See also== *par stability determinant *Addiction module *Sib RNA *SymR RNA *PtaRNA1 *RdlD RNA *IstR RNA *FlmB RNA *RatA ==ReferencesFurther reading== * * * Category:Bacteriology Category:Escherichia coli Category:RNA antitoxins Category:Cellular processes ","title":"Hok/sok system"},{"id":"12361156","text":"WPDX is a Classic Country formatted broadcast radio station licensed to Clarksburg, West Virginia, serving the Clarksburg/Fairmont/Buckhannon area.

At his trial he taunted the families of his victims, saying he wished he could dig up their bodies and defile their corpses. Thanos stated: \\"their cries bring laughter from the darkest caverns of my soul. I don't believe I could satisfy my thirst yet in this matter unless I was to be able to dig these brats' bones up out of their graves right now and beat them into powder and urinate on them and then stir it into a murky yellowish elixir and serve it up to their loved ones\\" during his sentencing hearing for the murder of Winebrenner and Pistorio. His attorney later said of Thanos: \\"What he did was reprehensible, that's true... the other thing is he is extremely damaged. He is an extremely damaged human being. And really, in our society we should not kill sick people. He really is a sick person.\\" Thanos waived all of his appeals and refused to fight his death sentence after he was convicted and sentenced to death. At that time, death by gas chamber was the only means of execution provided by the state of Maryland. Thanos agreed to a proposal by a lawyer of another prisoner sentenced to death to have his execution videotaped and his EEG data recorded, in an attempt to raise evidence that execution by gas chamber is cruel and unusual, as defined by the 8th Amendment, and thus unconstitutional. The legislature of Maryland responded by making lethal injection the primary means of execution in January 1994. Thanos was executed in 1994 by the state of Maryland by lethal injection, becoming the first person to be executed in Maryland since 1976 when the death penalty was reinstated. Thanos was 45 years old; his last words were \\"Adios!\\" ==See also== * Capital punishment in Maryland * Capital punishment in the United States ==References== General references * Capital Punishment History - Persons Executed in Maryland since 1923.

He became the first person to be executed in Mississippi since 1976 when the death penalty was reinstated. Dan Lohwasser, a reporter for United Press International, was one of the observers who witnessed Gray's execution. Lohwasser's account of Gray's death sparked controversy, because of the suffering that Gray exhibited. At the time of Gray's execution, the gas chamber used in Mississippi had a vertical iron bar directly behind the inmate's chair. There was no headrest or strap used to restrain Gray's head. As Gray began breathing in the toxic gas, he started thrashing his head around, striking the iron bar repeatedly before he finally lost consciousness. Officials decided to clear the observation room eight minutes after the gas had been released, because of Gray's injuries.\\"Might we make executions more civilized, please?\\" from CBC News The decision to clear the room was sharply criticized by Dennis Balske, Gray's attorney. \\"Jimmy Lee Gray died banging his head against a steel pole in the gas chamber while reporters counted his moans (eleven, according to the Associated Press)\\". In part because Gray's execution was botched, Mississippi passed legislation making lethal injection the only method of execution for inmates sentenced after July 1, 1984, though three more inmates (Edward Earl Johnson, Connie Evans and Leo Edwards) sentenced before this date were still executed by lethal gas.

It was initially a component of the Guinness Trust, founded in 1890 by Edward Guinness, 1st Earl of Iveagh, great-grandson of the founder of the Guinness Brewery, to help homeless people in Dublin and London. It is not otherwise related to the brewery company. ==Guinness Partnership== The Guinness Trust extended its objectives outside London in 1962 and today operates in all parts of England as a member of the Guinness Partnership, a group of housing associations. However, the Iveagh Trust became a separate organisation in 1903 with responsibility for activities in Ireland. It was given a statutory legal basis by the \\"Dublin Improvement (Bull Alley Area) Act\\" of 1903.Iveagh Hostel still trusts its century-old founding ethos, Irish Times, April 23 2008See also: Local and Personal Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom Today it is run as a charity under Irish law and liaises with such bodies as Dublin City Council and the Homeless Agency. ==Current== In today's central Dublin several original buildings in the area of St Patrick's Cathedral, Patrick Street and Christ Church Cathedral are still managed. Following a report by Dr. John Lumsden, they were built between 1896 and 1945 by the Iveagh Trust, including formerly the Iveagh Public Baths and the Iveagh Market building on Francis Street. Lord Iveagh also made donations to St Patrick's Cathedral and created the St Patrick's Park gardens in 1901 between the cathedral and the Iveagh Trust buildings. Today's buildings were therefore only a part of a larger urban renewal plan, at a time when Dublin was infamous for its poverty and its unsanitary tenements. In more recent times new estates have been acquired in Swords and Donaghmede, and a home for the elderly at Mount Anthony in south Dublin. Unlike Dublin City Council's housing list based on need, the trust has aimed to create mixed communities with smaller numbers. Each estate has a resident caretaker and a formal system of elected tenants' councils to advise of complaints or problems. The trust was run by Fred Stephens for many years until 2005, currently by Gene Clayton. The Trust also runs the Iveagh Hostel in central Dublin for homeless men, providing basic accommodation, meals and such facilities as a gym and a computer room. The original 508 cubicles have been converted to 195 bedrooms. Former residents include Liam O'Flaherty after leaving the army in 1917, and Patrick Kavanagh. A former trust building for children to play in, known as \\"The Bayno\\", was closed in 1975, and now houses Liberties College.The Iveagh Play Centre ‚Äì The Bayno , footnote at Liberties College website Flat 3B on the Bull Alley Estate is the only flat in The Iveagh Trust stock which has remained largely unchanged since the first tenants took up occupancy in 1904. Following the death of the last tenant, Nellie Molloy, in 2002, Trustees decided that the flat should remain a museum ‚Äì a visual reminder of flat design and of how families lived in the early days of The Iveagh Trust. Miranda, Lady Iveagh, kindly donated the funds to purchase the content of the flat from Nellie‚Äôs family to enable this to happen. The Museum Flat is available for viewing by appointment.

It was the site of one of the first discoveries in May 1945 of German mass graves in Norway. The German executioner Oskar Hans was the officer in command of the unit performing the executions. In total 173 Norwegians, 6 British and 15 Soviet citizens were executed in Trandumskogen. Many had been sentenced to death by the German occupation forces, but there was also a great number who were subject to arbitrary executions. After the Second World War, Norwegian citizens sentenced for treason, and leading members of the Norwegian national socialist party Nasjonal Samling were forced to open the graves and exhume the bodies of the executed prisoners. The medical identification of the corps was led by professor in forensic medicine Georg Waaler, assisted by dentist Ferdinand Str√∏m. On 10 October 1954, the memorial in Trandumskogen was unveiled. Crown Prince Olav stood for the ceremony. Per Palle Storm, artist and sculptor and professor at the National Art Academy had carried out the artistic part of the work. The memorial is carved of light Granite (Iddefjordgranitt). To the south side an inscription is carved in Norwegian. The same text translated into Russian is cut into the east side and in English to the west side. The memorial is located south of the burial ground. The memorial lists the names of those who were executed there. The memorial has status as a Norwegian national memorial. The text on the memorial reads:Picture of the monument :IN THE COMBAT FOR FREEDOM DURING THE 1940-1945 WAR 173 NORWEGIANS 15 SOVJET- SUBJECTS AND 6 BRITONS WERE HERE IN THE WOODS OF TRAN- DUM EXECUTED BY THE ENEMY ==The names of those executed at Trandumskogen== Grave 1, 1 March 1943 *Arthur Oskar Berg from Odda *Bjarne Dalland from Bergen *Daniel Theodor Danielsen from Voss *Thor Gerotti Espelid from Odda *Ole Kjell Karlsen from Oslo *Leif Arnoldus Kindem from Odda *Ingolf Kleppest√∏ from Odda *Olav Kvernmo from Oslo *Ottar Lie from Oslo *Gustav Adolf Ner√•sen from √òyer *Lars Nordb√∏ from Oslo *Olaf Prestegaard from Odda *Harald Andreas Gerotti Sl√•ttelid from Odda *Arne Stensrud from Oslo *Reidar Svendsen from Oslo *Sigurd Syvertsen from Krokstadelva *Knut Veka from Odda Grave 2, 3 September 1943 *Marius Nikolai Karlsen from Skjerv√∏y *Hillfl David Lie from Oslo *Karsten L√∏vestad from Tr√∏gstad Grave 3, 30 October 1944 *Nicolai Bachilin from the Soviet Union *Jacob Brunelin from the Soviet Union *Jacob Magnus Fr√∏yland from Farsund *Fedor Getnikow from the Soviet Union *Eyolf Haug from Kongsberg *Odd Trygve Christiansen from Fagernes *Audun Lavik from Lyngdal *Michael Lotikow from the Soviet Union *Vladimir Medownikow from the Soviet Union *Sverre Emil Narvesen from Modum *Thormod Johannes Nygaard from Oslo *Gunnar Onshuus from Sandefjord *Simon Peachawow from the Soviet Union *Rolf Edvin Pettersen from Drammen *Borti Reichelt from Krager√∏ *Boris Resnick from the Soviet Union *Hugo Rossnes from Oslo *Reidar Steen Olsen from Sandefjord *Olaf Strand from Bergen *Per Rolf Syvertsen *Karl Ludvig S√∏rensen from Sandefjord *Patike Tschikidse from the Soviet Union Grave 4, 30 April 1942 *Leif Bye Nielsen from Oslo *Arne Gr√∏nn Disch from T√∏nsberg *Ole Elias Dyr√∏y from Borgund *Harald B√∏lerud from Oslo *Per Andreas Fillinger from Oslo *Jakob Otto Friis from Oslo *Andreas Gjertsen from Oslo *Leonard Godager from Furnes *Ole Kjeldserg from Nordstrand *Alfred Waldemar Garmann Larsen from Oslo *Ole Arntzen Lutzow Holm from Oslo *Einar Oliver Mj√∏lhus from Hjelmland *Jesper Kjell N√¶ss from Odal *Bjarne Fillip Olsen from √Ölesund *Magnus Tuntland from Hjelmland *Peter Kristian Boe Young from Oslo *Birger Aasland from Hjelmland *K√•re Angell Elgenes from Molde (executed 1 May) Grave 6, 5 September 1944 *Kristian Andresen from Gj√∏vik *Fedor Barkow from the Soviet Union *Finn Brede Br√•then from Modum *Peter Christensen from Oslo *Arne Reidar Gustavsen from Drammen *Reinhard Halvorsen from Norderhov *Petter Albert Hammer√∏ from Oslo *Reidar Hansen from Norderhov *√Öge Hansen from Oslo *Daniel Jacowitz from the Soviet Union *Ove Jensen from Asker *Georg Johannes Jenserud from Norderhov *Martin Kleppan from Oslo *Johan Karelius Moen from Norderhov *Helge Olsen from Norderhov *K√•re Pettersen from Drammen *Stephan Pleschatschew from the Soviet Union *Wasil Sacharschenko from the Soviet Union *Gunnar K Skinstad from Modum *Gjermund Karl Skaarud from Oslo *Per Thore Stensrud from Oslo *Alexander Szeinzuk from the Soviet Union *Benani Tschikikow from the Soviet Union Grave 7, 3 June 1944 *Gunnar Hanssen from Oslo *Kaare Hexeberg from Nittedal *Oskar Haakon Johannessen from Nittedal *Per Grell L√∏nning from Oslo *Odd N√¶ss from Oslo Grave 8, 25/26 May 1944 25 May 1944 *Hans Skj√¶rv√∏ from Osen *Georg Stokke from Oslo 26 May 1944 *Thore Eugen Sentzen from Svanvik in S√∏r-Varanger *Magnus Dahlen from F√•berg *Lars Emil Erichsen from Oslo *John Hatland from Oslo *Frederik Wilhelm Holter from Oslo *Odvar Jacobsen from Oslo *Leif Richard Johansen from Oslo *Harald Reitan from Oslo *Per Arne Stranger Thorsen from Oslo *Sven Olav Vogt from Oslo Grave 9, Unknown date *F.

Francis is produced by Robert Arthur, directed by Arthur Lubin, and stars Donald O'Connor and Patricia Medina. The distinctive voice of Francis is a voice-over by actor Chill Wills. Six Francis sequels from Universal-International followed this first effort. During World War II, a junior American Army officer gets sent to the psychiatric ward whenever he insists that an Army mule named Francis speaks to him. ==Plot== When a bank manager discovers Peter Stirling, one of his tellers, is attracting public attention he calls the young man in who relates his story in flashback. Then Second Lieutenant Peter Stirling (Donald O'Connor) is caught behind Japanese lines in Burma during World War II. Francis, a talking Army mule (voiced by Chill Wills), carries him to safety. When Stirling insists that the animal rescued him, he is placed in a psychiatric ward. Each time Stirling is released, he accomplishes something noteworthy (at the instigation of Francis), and each time he is sent back to the psych ward when he insists on crediting the talking mule. Finally, Stirling is able to convince three-star General Stevens (John McIntire) that he is not crazy, and he and the general become the only ones aware of Francis' secret. In an effort to get himself released from the psych ward, Stirling asks Stevens to order Francis to speak, but the mule will not obey until it becomes clear that Stirling will be arrested for treason if he remains silent. During one of his enforced hospital stays, he is befriended by Maureen Gelder (Patricia Medina), a beautiful French refugee. He grows to trust her and tells her about Francis. Later, a propaganda radio broadcast from Tokyo Rose mocks the Allies for being advised by a mule. This leads to the suspicion of Stirling or Maureen being a Japanese agent. The press is later informed that the absurd mule story was concocted in order to flush out the spy, and with Francis' help, the real culprit is identified. Francis is shipped back to the U. S. for further study, but his military transport crashes in the wilds of Kentucky. After the war, convinced that Francis survived the crash, Peter searches for and finally finds the mule still alive and well and talking! ==Cast== *Donald O'Connor as Peter Stirling *Patricia Medina as Maureen Gelder *Chill Wills as Francis the talking mule *ZaSu Pitts as Nurse Valerie Humpert *Ray Collins as Colonel Hooker *John McIntire as General Stevens (as John McIntyre) *Eduard Franz as Colonel Plepper *Howland Chamberlain as Major Nadel *James Todd as Colonel Saunders *Robert Warwick as Colonel Carmichael *Frank Faylen as Sergeant Chillingbacker *Tony Curtis as Captain Jones (as Anthony Curtis) *Mikel Conrad as Major Garber *Loren Tindell as Major Richards *Charles Meredith as Munroe, the banker ==Production== Development Lubin became attached to the film in March 1948.Looking at Hollywood, Hopper, Hedda, Chicago Daily Tribune, 4 March 1948: B6. He was attracted to the light material because \\"as a movie fan myself, I am tired of watching neurotic material on the screen. I can easily skip the latest psychiatric spell binders, but I've seen Miracle on 34th Street a half dozen times.\\" In September 1948 it was announced Robert Stillman, Joseph H. Nadel, and Arthur Lubin had purchased the film rights from David Stern; Sillman would produce and Lubin would direct.Studio Briefs, Los Angeles Times, 24 September 1948: 21. (Lubin said he a friend who worked at a literary agency recommended the book to him.) Lubin took the film to Universal who were originally not interested. However their story editor, who later became an assistant to Harold Robbins was interested, especially as Universal had a commitment to Donald O'Connor for $30,000 and were looking to make something cheap. The studio advanced Lubin $10,000 as a test to see if he could make the mule talk. The test proved to be successful and Universal agreed to make the film. They set up the production at Universal where it was turned into a starring vehicle for Donald O'Connor.Of Local Origin, New York Times, 1 March 1949: 31. Lubin worked on the script with Stern. Dorothy Davenport Reid (widow of silent film star Wallace Reid) worked on the script.Fidelity Pictures Buys Herbert Book: Welsch-Peters Firm Will Make 'House by River,' 1920 Novel, for Republic Release, Thomas F. Brady, New York Times, 4 April 1949: 27. Lubin said it was the first time that he had a financial interest in any film he had made: > Directing Francis gave me a new slant on picture making after some years of > acting and producing in both New York and Hollywood. I love Francis, first > because it's good entertainment, and secondly because I own a bit of that > ornery mule.So The Mmule Talks--: Reporter: By Arthur Lubin Director of > \\"Francis\\".

Francis the mule was signed to a seven-year contract with Universal-International, according to an article in Newsweek magazine. Newsweek also reported that Francis' entourage included \\"a make-up man, trainer, hairdresser, and sanitary engineer, complete with broom and Airwick.\\" Robert Arthur the producer later said the film was budgeted at $580,000 but went $42,000 over budget. Lubin later said the film cost $150,000. \\"Donald got $30,000 at the time, the mule cost nothing. We had three mules then. And we made that picture in fifteen days.\\" ==Reception== The film was the eleventh biggest hit of the year in the U. S. In May 1950 it was announced Universal-International had purchased all rights to the character Francis from author David Stern, including the right to make an unlimited number of sequels.'Francis' Stories Are Bought By U.-I.: Studio Acquires All Rights to David Stern's Future Yarns About the Army Mule, Thomas F. Brady, New York Times, 17 May 1950: 35. Diabolique said \\"Lubin‚Äôs handling is always sure and confident, and they contain some genuinely hilarious moments and sensational performances from O‚ÄôConnor and Chill Wills (who voiced Francis). Admittedly the structure gets repetitive ‚Äì generally in first half hour everyone thinks Donald O‚ÄôConnor is mad, then Francis talks to someone, there‚Äôs another half hour of people thinking they‚Äôre mad, then Francis talks to a few more people, then another half hour and more allegations of madness, then Francis talks to everyone.\\" ==Video releases== The original film, Francis (1950), was released in 1978 as one of the first- ever titles in the new LaserDisc format, Discovision Catalog #22-003. (The Discovision Library) It was then re-issued on LaserDisc in May 1994 by MCA/Universal Home Video (Catalog #: 42024) as part of an Encore Edition Double Feature with Francis Goes to the Races (1951). The first two Francis films were released again in 2004 by Universal Pictures on Region 1 and Region 4 DVD, along with the next two in the series, as The Adventures of Francis the Talking Mule Vol. 1. Several years later, Universal released all 7 Francis films as a set on three Region 1 and Region 4 DVDs, Francis The Talking Mule: The Complete Collection. ==ReferencesExternal links== * * * Category:1950 films Category:1950s fantasy-comedy films Category:American films Category:American black-and-white films Category:English-language films Category:American fantasy-comedy films Category:Films directed by Arthur Lubin Category:Military humor in film Category:Films about donkeys Category:Films set in Myanmar Category:Burma Campaign films Category:Universal Pictures films Category:Films based on American novels Category:Films scored by Frank Skinner Category:1950 comedy films ","title":"Francis (film)"},{"id":"12361360","text":"The Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity (ACLEI) is an Australian government statutory agency, created under the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act 2006.

After his conviction in March 1975, he was on death row for 20 years, receiving eight stays of execution. His ninth stay of execution was denied by the United States courts of appeals.Henry Weinstein, \\"Denial of Stay Puts Montana Killer One Step Closer to Death\\", Los Angeles Times, May 9, 1995.

He is 1 of only 3 people to have been executed in Montana since the reinstatement of the death penalty. ==Background== McKenzie was originally from Illinois. He was also widowed. ==Crime overview== He was convicted on the murder, rape, and death by asphyxia of Lana Harding. He was sentenced to mandatory death for aggravated kidnapping. The crime was committed on January 21, 1974 in the early morning. Harding was a schoolteacher in a small one-classroom schoolhouse and members of the community raised concerns of her well being when she did not arrive at the school and her shoes were left in the driveway. Mark Downey, \\"Parents, students recall the day Harding didn't come to school\\", \\"Great Falls Tribune\\", May 10, 1995. ==Suspicions== He was also suspected to have murdered Debra Prety, a teenager from Coeur d'Alene. However, at the date of his execution McKenzie had never confessed to the murder of Prety or Harding. At the time of Prety's death he lived relatively close to the family home and was on parole from attacking another woman. Three months after the McKenzie committed the murder of Harding.

WOBG was owned and operated by Burbach Broadcasting Company. ==History== WBLK went on the air on April 21, 1937. It was owned by the Exponent Company of Clarksburg and began its operations on 1370 kHz as a daytime-only station. Within months of signing on, however, the Federal Communications Commission approved the station's request to go unlimited time, saying that any interference to station WPAY would not be sufficient to deny the application. The station's base in the Robinson Grand Theater was devastated by a $350,000 fire on May 31, 1939; alert staffers saved equipment and transcriptions, and the station was back on the air within 45 minutes, using emergency studios at its transmitter site, to report news of the blaze, which endangered 20 firefighters. WBLK was sold in 1941, days after moving to 1400 kHz in the wake of NARBA, to the Charleston Broadcasting Company. Sales to the News Publishing Company (in 1947) and the Ohio Valley Broadcasting Corporation (in 1951) followed, as did a venture into television. In 1952, WBLK filed for channel 12 in Clarksburg, seeking to trade on the TV first call rights it held from its NBC radio affiliation. Two issues delayed the application‚Äîand the television station‚Äîfor years. The first was a challenge by the publisher of Clarksburg's two daily newspapers, saying that Ohio Valley's ownership of the TV station would result in a monopoly; this led to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit overturning the FCC's grant. The newspapers withdrew their obligations in 1957, while the FCC ruled that new owners WSTV, Inc.‚Äîowners of WSTV radio and television in Steubenville, Ohio‚Äîcould set up the station in Clarksburg because there was minimal overlap between the two cities. WBLK became WBOY in 1957, call letters that the new WBOY-TV would also adopt before its sign-on in 1958. The Rust Craft station group held on to WBOY radio and television through 1976, when it sold the two to separate buyers. The WBBN Broadcasting Company, headed by Lee Dixon, acquired the radio station for $90,000; the TV station kept the WBOY designation, and the radio station became WBBN, retaining the middle-of-the- road music format and NBC affiliation of WBOY. The format survived another call letter change when Allegheny Broadcasting bought the station in 1980 and renamed it WPQZ. Allegheny did not hold on long, selling WPQZ for $128,000 two years later to the Gilcom Corporation of West Virginia, making it a sister to stations in Weirton and Altoona, Pennsylvania. Gilcom sold WPQZ to Radio Two, owner of Clarksburg FM station WKKW, for $387,500 just 14 months later. Between 1985 and January 1987‚Äîwhen Radio Two's sister company Radio One sold off the FM‚Äîthe two stations formed a simulcast, with the AM adopting the WKKW call letters and its country music format. On May 5, 1989, WPQZ became WOBG, part of a year of major changes that included a format flip to oldies and the station's sale for $100,000 to Hilber Corporation, owned by Robert Steinhilber. Later in 1990, Hilber bought the station's second FM partner, new station WXKI in Salem, which became WOBG-FM after having signed on December 31, 1989. Hilber sold both stations to Burbach Broadcasting for nearly $625,000 in 1998; the sale price included the assumption of almost $265,000 in debt. Ultimately, aging equipment sealed WOBG's fate in 2009, by which time the station was broadcasting adult standards music. In asking for authority to remain silent with the FCC, Burbach informed the commission that WOBG went off the air on December 17 of that year due to a series of fatal failures of its transmitter.BLSTA-20091217ACI ‚Äî Request for Remain Silent Authority ‚Äî WOBG The station never returned to the air, with its license expiring as a matter of law on December 18, 2010. ==ReferencesExternal links== OBG Category:Defunct radio stations in the United States Category:Radio stations established in 1936 Category:Radio stations disestablished in 2009 Category:1936 establishments in West Virginia Category:2009 disestablishments in West Virginia OBG ","title":"WOBG (AM)"},{"id":"12361474","text":"William Evans F.R.C.P.(Lond.), Hon.

A few days later, Clark was taken into custody and he confessed to a minister while in jail. ==Trial and appeals== In 1986, public defenders Sheila Lewis and Steve Aarons were assigned to represent Clark. In a rare legal maneuver, Clark pleaded guilty to first degree murder in hopes of being sentenced before Governor Toney Anaya completed his term of office. However, District Judge Stanley F. Frost refused to hold a sentence hearing before Anaya's last day in office. As a result, Clark was not among the five men on death row whose death sentences were commuted by Anaya to life in prison without possibility of parole. The following year, a jury in Tucumcari, New Mexico returned with a death sentence against Clark. In 1994, the New Mexico Supreme Court overturned that sentence, found reversible error related to the first jury's understanding of the meaning of life in prison, and mandated a new sentencing hearing. In 1996, prominent New Mexico capital defense lawyer Gary Mitchell represented Clark at his retrial in Silver City, New Mexico. Aarons and Anaya were among dozens of witnesses who testified on behalf of Clark. Anaya explained why he would have commuted Clark's sentence if he had the legal authority to do so. The second jury also returned a death sentence. ==Execution== Clark waived his appeals in 1999 and was executed on November 6, 2001.

Almost all Finnish students receive financial aid, including foreigners who are permanent residents or EU citizens.Financial aid for foreign students, Kela website It is available in the form of: * a study grant * a government- backed student loan * a housing supplement (starting 1 August 2017, available only to those who are studying abroad or enrolled in a tuition-based programme at a folk high school or sports institute and living in the school dormitory). **students are eligible for general housing benefits The qualifying conditions for student financial aid are: * admission to a school * full-time study * academic progress * need of financial assistance. They are a kind of transfer payment. Similar systems, some of which are older, exist in some other countries where education is free of charge, e.g. Germany and Sweden. Student benefit is paid by the state to all qualifying students, excluding only those with full-time employment and income, and is thus distinct from an individually evaluated scholarship. In addition, Finnish students enjoy several kinds of student benefits such as: * Partially state-funded meals at student cafeterias. ==Details== Secondary and tertiary education is free of charge in Finland. Monetary support is paid by the government agency KELA. Most student financial aid is paid to students in tertiary education, but smaller amounts are available also on the secondary level. Student benefits are independent of parents' income in tertiary education for students over the age of 20 who live alone. In tertiary education, students in bachelor's and master's programmes qualify for financial aid. Only those months spent actively studying are supported; i.e. in summer, benefits cease unless a special summer studying plan is submitted and followed. For students in tertiary education, the figures are as follows. Direct monetary support for students over the age of 20 who live alone is ‚Ç¨303.19 per month for those who have started their studies before autumn 2014 and ‚Ç¨336.76 for people starting their education in autumn 2014 or later. Rent support is 80% of rent or maximum ‚Ç¨201.60. The state or the universities generally do not provide student accommodation. Dormitories are usually run by foundations and student unions, and cannot accommodate all students. The state secures student loans (from private banks) for up to ‚Ç¨400 per month. Student meals are supported by ‚Ç¨1.94 per meal and available for example on (privately operated) student cafeterias on campus, thus the effective price is about ‚Ç¨2-3. Persistent failure to progress in studies ultimately leads to the termination of student benefits. Likewise, when evaluated on a yearly basis, income of over ‚Ç¨660 per month on supported months and over ‚Ç¨1,970 per month on unsupported months reduces the student benefit. Typically, nine months are supported and three summer months are not, which gives a maximum annual income of ‚Ç¨11,850. The benefits were raised in 2008 and 2014: in 2008 the direct support was increased by 15% and the income limits were raised by 30%; in August 2014 the direct support was raised by approx. 1.3% for those already studying and 11% larger for those starting their studies in 2014 accompanied by a 5-month decrease in the period of financial aid and a ‚Ç¨100 increase in the student loan security. Despite this, students often find the benefit insufficient, thus working while studying or spending the entire summer at summer jobs is popular. Student loans are less popular than elsewhere. In year 2019 each Finnish student had approximately 8,200 euros in student debt. Student benefits are available to Finnish citizens.

He was convicted of first degree murder and robbery in 1962. Mays was 34 years old at the time of execution. ==Biography== Mays, a black man from North Carolina, was sentenced to death for killing a customer during a robbery at a bar in New York.The Last Executioner: \\"Dow B. Hover was paid by the state to run its electric chair in the 1950s and '60s. The job may have cost him more than he earned. The crime occurred shortly after he had arrived in the city following release from prison in his home state.\\", Village Voice, January 18, 2005. Mays and two accomplices held up the Friendly Tavern, at 1403 Fifth Avenue in East Harlem on March 23, 1961. Mays ordered the owner and the patrons to put their cash on the bar. However 31-year-old Maria Marini, who witnesses said was too slow to comply, enraged Mays. After opening her purse and finding it empty, Mays put a .38 caliber revolver to her forehead and pulled the trigger, killing her instantly. The gang stole a total of $275 from the bartender and several customers during the robbery. At Mays' subsequent trial, the court heard that he had been part of a gang which had committed 52 robberies in six weeks. Mays told reporters he would rather \\"fry\\" than spend his life in prison. Mays entered the execution room at 10:01 p.m. on August 15, 1963, accompanied by a Protestant chaplain, and was strapped into the electric chair. He made no final statement to the prison warden or other witnesses before being electrocuted, and was pronounced dead three minutes later, at 10:04 p.m. Mays would become the last person to be executed by \\"Old Sparky\\", New York State's electric chair at Sing Sing prison. The State Electrician was Dow Hover. The electric chair had been the sole method of execution in the State since 1890 (hanging had been abolished in 1888). In 1965, the State of New York repealed the death penalty, except for cases involving the murder of a police officer.Craig Brandon, The Electric Chair: An Unnatural American History, 1999 Although the legislature never fully repealed the death penalty statute, and the state even expanded it in 1995, there were no further executions because of rulings by Furman v. Georgia in 1972 at the Supreme Court and People v. LaValle in 2004 at the New York Court of Appeals. == See also == * List of people executed in New York * List of most recent executions by jurisdiction * Capital punishment in the United States ==ReferencesExternal links== * New York Executions; retrieved November 12, 2007. * NY Timeline.

He is particularly known for Demi- tarif (2004) and Charly (2006). ==Background== Kolia's father is Swiss-Russian stage director Hans-Peter Litscher and his mother is French-Algerian actress Catherine Belkhodja. His three sisters, Ma√Øwenn Le Besco, Isild Le Besco and Leonor Graser are involved in acting, scriptwriting, and film directing and producing, as well as is his brother Jowan Le Besco. Kolia is the youngest of the five siblings. His mother Catherine had just completed a film with Chris Marker at the Beaubourg museum, when she began labour and was rushed to the hospital just in time to give birth to Kolia. ==Career== Kolia's first role was in Place des Vosges when he was barely a toddler. He later appeared in short films by Emma de Caunes, Michel Fehler, Jos√©phine Flasseur and Emmanuelle Bercot, before playing one of the principles characters in the directorial debut of his older sister Isild Le Besco, in her Demi-tarif, a film which was screened at over fifty film festivals and was widely acclaimed by film critics. Of her younger brother's performance in her debut film, director Isild Le Besco stated he was courageous and generous. There was a swimming scene where the water was very cold, and Kolia continued to swim until police summoned by others arrived to halt the shot out of concern for his safety. He was cast again in Le Besco‚Äôs second film as director, Charly, as Nicolas, a teenager in revolt, alongside Julie-Marie Parmentier as his partner. In the film, his character is a young boy placed in foster care who is so fascinated by a postcard of Belle-Ile-en-Mer, that he runs away to try to get to his dream. Hitchhiking his way to the suburbs of Nantes, he meets Charly, a young girl living in a caravan who survives by prostituting herself.

It features the Tenth Doctor and his companion Martha Jones. This paperback is part of the Quick Reads Initiative sponsored by the UK government, to encourage literacy. It has a similar look to BBC Books' other new series adventures, except for its much shorter word count, being a paperback and not being numbered as part of the same series. To date it is the one of only five novels based upon the revived series that have not been published in hardcover: the first, I am a Dalek, was published in May 2006; the second, Made of Steel, was published in March 2007; the fourth, The Sontaran Games, was published in February 2009; and the fifth, Code of the Krillitanes, was published in March 2010. These four books are also part of the Quick Reads Initiative. The book sees the return of the Judoon, who were first seen in the third series episode \\"Smith and Jones\\", and again in \\"The Stolen Earth\\".

Coleman was executed in 1990 after almost twelve years on death row at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary. He was put to death by the State of Oklahoma by lethal injection at the age of 43 after exhausting all appeals. (At the time, Coleman had become friends with Gregory R.

However, Challenor's success on the 1923 tour of England established his reputation.James, p. 94.

It was founded by Grand Master Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc in 1776 out of the collections of the knight Louis Gu√©rin de Tencin. It has been a legal deposit library since 1925, and it has the largest collection of Melitensia along with that of the University of Malta. The library also contains the archives of the Order of St. John, the Universit√† of Mdina and the Universit√† of Valletta. The library is housed in a late 18th-century neoclassical building in the city centre, close to the Grandmaster's Palace, designed by Polish-Italian architects Stefano Ittar and his son Sebastiano Ittar. ==History== The origins of the National Library of Malta go back to 1555, when Grand Master Claude de la Sengle decreed that all books belonging to deceased members of the Order of St. John were to be passed to the Order's treasury. In 1760, Louis Gu√©rin de Tencin, the Bailiff Grand Cross of the Order, purchased a collection of 9700 books which had belonged to Joaqu√≠n Fern√°ndez de Portocarrero for 7000 scudi. A year later, he opened a public library in a building known as Il Forfantone in Valletta, containing books from his own library as well as Portocarrero's collection, the library of Comm. Sainte-Jay (which was previously kept at the sacristy of the Conventual Church of St. John), and books donated by members of the Order. De Tencin appointed Giovanni Pietro Francesco Agius de Soldanis as librarian, and paid his salary himself. De Tencin died in 1766 before managing to secure funds for maintaining the library. In 1776, Grand Master Emmanuel de Rohan- Polduc formally founded the Bibliotheca Publica, and it was also called the Bibliotheca Tanseana in De Tencin's honour. The Forfantone was considered too cramped to house the new library, so the Polish-born Italian architect Stefano Ittar was commissioned to design a new library building in 1786. The building was built on the site of the Conservatoria, where gold and silver bullion of the Order's treasury were stored. It was completed in 1796, but it remained empty for some years due to the French invasion of 1798. It was eventually inaugurated on 4 June 1812 by Civil Commissioner Sir Hildebrand Oakes, and it became known as the Malta Public Library. It became a legal deposit library by Act no. II of 1925, and in 1936 it was granted the title of Royal Malta Library by King George V. In 1937, the archives of the Order were transferred to the library from the Public Registry. In 1976, the Central Public Library was opened in Floriana, and the Valletta library became a research and reference library known as the National Library of Malta. ==Architecture== Malta Public Library, Valletta, painting by Charles Frederick de Brocktorff Public lecture at the main hall The library building was designed by the Polish-Italian architect Stefano Ittar, and it is an early example of neoclassical architecture in Malta. It has a symmetrical fa√ßade with Doric and Ionic columns. The first floor is supported on a loggia, with the main doorway in the centre. A balustraded balcony is located above the doorway, and it is supported by Doric and Ionic columns. The building is also well known for its neo-classic monumental staircase that spreads from the main entrance to the upper floors.Thake, Conrad (1 August 2007). Scenographic Baroque Staircases (Part 2). The Malta Independent. Retrieved 14 June 2016.

He became the first person to be executed by the state of Pennsylvania since the United States reinstituted the death penalty in 1976. == Murder == In the early hours of the morning on October 13, 1980, two police officers were out on patrol in Harrisburg in an unmarked car. They heard gunfire coming from a nearby wooded area which was unlit and often used for dumping trash. As they approached the scene they found a 1967 Ford van parked on a dirt road near some bushes. After hearing rustling noises coming from the bushes they ordered the person making the noise to come out. Zettlemoyer emerged from the woods holding a handgun and a flashlight. Zettlemoyer claimed he had been shooting rats, but the officers were not convinced. Zettlemoyer was ordered to drop the gun and was then secured. One of the officers searched the area and came across the body of 29-year-old Charles DeVetsco. He had been shot a total of four times. It later emerged he had been shot twice in the van while handcuffed and was then dragged from the van to the woods where two more fatal shots were fired. The cause of death was confirmed as a massive hemorrhaging of the heart, which had been penetrated by .357 magnum bullets. == Trial and execution == DeVetsco had worked with Zettlemoyer at a retail store. He had been scheduled to testify against Zettlemoyer in an upcoming robbery trial in Snyder County. Zettlemoyer and an accomplice had carried out a robbery in May 1980. They had bound a security guard at a RadioShack near Sunbury and had stolen electronic equipment worth thousands of dollars. The accomplice was later caught trying to return the equipment for money and had named Zettlemoyer as his partner. Zettlemoyer had then told DeVetsco about the heist. DeVetsco contacted the authorities, and had planned to testify against Zettlemoyer. Zettlemoyer had kidnapped DeVetsco near Selinsgrove and had driven him to Harrisburg to kill him. The reason he killed him was in order to prevent his testimony. On April 24, 1981, Zettlemoyer was convicted of first degree murder and was sentenced to death. After spending fourteen years on death row, Zettlemoyer fired his lawyers and dropped his efforts to live. He begged the courts to let him die because he claimed \\"brain disease\\" was making his life hell. Doctors reported that Zettlemoyer was suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder. Lawyers for the Pennsylvania Post-Conviction Defender Organization argued that Zettlemoyer was not mentally competent, however, three psychiatrists testified he was sane. DeVetsco's mother also argued that Zettlemoyer was mentally ill and was therefore not competent to be executed for the murder of her son. Zettlemoyer was executed by lethal injection on May 2, 1995, at State Correctional Institution ‚Äì Rockview. His last meal was two cheeseburgers, french fries, chocolate pudding and chocolate milk. He became the first person to be executed by the state of Pennsylvania since the resumption of the death penalty in 1976 and the first inmate put to death in Pennsylvania in thirty- three years. He remains the first of only three people to be executed in Pennsylvania since the resumption of the death penalty. The others were Leon Moser in August 1995 and Gary M. Heidnik in 1999. == See also == * Capital punishment in Pennsylvania * Capital punishment in the United States * List of people executed in Pennsylvania == References == Category:1955 births Category:1995 deaths Category:American murderers Category:20th-century American criminals Category:20th-century executions by Pennsylvania Category:20th-century executions of American people Category:1980 murders in the United States Category:American people convicted of murder Category:People convicted of murder by Pennsylvania Category:People executed by Pennsylvania by lethal injection Category:People executed for murder ","title":"Keith Zettlemoyer"},{"id":"12361678","text":"Front of the National Library of Uruguay.

The speaker considers the words that other authors use. \\"Dedicated words\\" (line 3) refers to words used to dedicate their writings to the young man, and it could also refer to the writings themselves.

The Reader and the Young Man Sonnets. Barnes & Noble. 1981. p. 105. ==Structure== Sonnet 82 is an English or Shakespearean sonnet, which has three quatrains, followed by a final rhyming couplet. It follows the rhyme scheme ABAB CDCD EFEF GG and is composed in iambic pentameter, a metre of five feet per line, with two syllables in each foot accented weak/strong. Most of the lines are examples of regular iambic pentameter, including the 2nd line: √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / And therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook (82.2) :/ = ictus, a metrically strong syllabic position. √ó = nonictus. The sonnet exhibits a few variations of the meter, some of which will depend on interpretation. The following lines may be read with metrical regularity, but also may be read with a rightward movement of the first ictus in line 4 (resulting in a four-position figure, \`√ó √ó / /\`, sometimes referred to as a minor ionic); and an initial reversal in line 5: √ó √ó / / √ó / √ó / √ó / Of their fair subject, blessing every book. / √ó √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue, (82.4-5) A reversal and minor ionic may be found in lines 6 and 8, respectively.

Robert Coe pulled up next to them and began to talk to them, acting as if he knew Cary's father and needed directions to his house. Cary got into Coe's car to help him, and she was never seen alive again. As soon as she was reported missing, friends and neighbors in the close-knit community began a massive search to locate Cary or the man whose car she was last seen in. The following day, her body was found at the end of a road on the outskirts of town. An autopsy revealed that she had been sexually assaulted. Coe had a long history of drug abuse, mental illness, and indecent exposure. Shortly after the crime he told family members that he had killed someone, but they initially did not believe him. After hearing about the murdered girl, some of Coe's family members started to help him evade capture by buying him a bus ticket to Georgia, but another notified the police. Coe was captured at the bus station. ==Confession== Coe was arrested on September 4. He confessed to the murder three days later, giving a detailed description of the crime. Coe confessed that he drove Cary to an isolated spot on the outskirts of town and then, according to his confessional videotape, masturbated while the child watched. It is speculated that he also molested and raped her in his Ford Gran Torino or somewhere nearby. According to the same taped confession, he then became angry at her when she said to him repeatedly \\"Jesus loves you\\" after witnessing his sexual act or possibly after his sexual assault. He then decided he was going to murder her. He went around to her side of the car and yanked her out of the car by her throat. He choked the eight year-old until she turned blue, but he could not strangle her. He then told her to walk down the road and while he walked behind her, he pulled out a pocketknife and stabbed her in the throat. She fell to the ground, grasping at her throat, and quickly bled to death. == Execution == On April 19, 2000, he was executed at the Riverbend Maximum Security Institution in Nashville, Tennessee, by lethal injection. He became the first person to be executed by the State of Tennessee since 1976 when the death penalty was reinstated.

It forms part of the broader musical tradition of mainland Greece and of the southern Balkans. Compared to other regions of Greece, the music of Macedonia is characterized by a high degree of diversity, due to the numerous influences it has received over the years from neighboring countries and particularly from refugees arriving in the early 20th century. In general terms, Macedonian music can be thought of as the connecting chain between the Western musical tradition of Epirus and Thessaly and the Eastern musical tradition of Thrace and Constantinople. Macedonian music is known for its tradition of patriotic folk songs, including klepht songs and songs that make references to the Macedonian Struggle. It is also notable for the use of brass instruments (called ch√°lkina), trumpets, tympana and koudounia. Other instruments used include clarinet, violin and Macedonian lyra. Folk dances from Macedonia include the Macedonia, Hasapiko (found allover Greece), Leventikos, Endeka Kozanis, Stankena, Akritikos, Baidouska, Macedonikos antikristos, Kori Eleni, Partalos, Kleftikos Macedonikos, Mpougatsas, Kastorianos, O Nikolos, Antikrystos, Sirtos Macedonias and Kapitan Louka. Macedonia and especially its capital, Thessaloniki, maintains also a thriving music scene and has been home to many of Greece's most prominent popular musicians of singers, including Marinella, Stavros Kouyioumtzis, Giannis Kalatzis, Paschalis Terzis, Natassa Theodoridou, Antonis Remos, Nikos Papazoglou, Giannis Aggelakas, as well as bands such as Onirama, Xylina Spathia, Trypes and Nightrage. ==History== Excavations in Macedonia have discovered musical instruments similar to the aulos as early as the Neolithic Era and throughout classical antiquity. The Ancient Macedonians enjoyed similar music to the rest of the Ancient Greeks and Alexander the Great and his successors build odea for musical performances in every city they built, from Alexandria in Egypt to cities as distant as Ai-Khanoum in what is now modern-day Afghanistan. Macedonian songs are in particular influenced by the Acritic Byzantine tradition, while instruments such as the tambourine, the Macedonian lyra and the Macedonian bagpipe are directly descended from medieval Greek equivalents. Many local dances such as Syrtos have also been danced to similar music for hundrend of years. Modern Macedonian music is an admixture of the music of pre-20th century Greek Macedonians, which has some similarities to the music of neighboring Epirus and Thessaly, such as the music of Greek refugees from Asia Minor, who arrived following the Asia Minor disaster. Prior to the population exchanges of the 20th century, Macedonia also had large Turkish and Slavic populations, who also influenced the local musical tradition, which forms a continuum with the music of Turkey, Bulgaria and North Macedonia. ==Regional variation== Western Macedonian music is the closest to that of Thessaly and Epirus and is dominated by brass instruments, with the exception of Grevena and the surrounding area, where the Epirot orchestra (clarinet, violin, laouto and tambourine) is more common. Grevena is also known for its folk and Acritic songs traditionally sung by women without accompanying instruments to celebrate Easter. These songs date back to the Middle Ages and were passed down over the centuries among the then largely illiterate rural population. A similar tradition is found in the historically Greek-speaking villages of the western and southern parts of Kozani. The cities of Kozani and Kastoria follow a separate tradition of urban songs, which survive until this day. A rich brass tradition also evolved in Pella and Kilkis, replacing the earlier zurna (karamuza) and bagpipe bands, which still dominate Imathia and much of Central and Eastern Macedonia. In Naoussa and the surrounding area, traditional orchestras consist of the famous davul and zurna combination, while Veria is known for its Ottoman-style urban music. In mountainous Pieria, the dominant instrument was the gaida, while Chalkidike, due to its tradition of sea-faring trade, shares more in common with the music of the Aegean islands, the dominant instruments there being the violin and the laouto. Nearer the border with North Macedonia and particularly in Florina, songs such as Leventikos and associated dances are shared between Greek and Slavic speakers, with the same songs often having lyrics in both languages. ==Folk Songs== *My white doves (ŒëœÉœÄœÅŒ± ŒºŒøœÖ œÄŒµœÅŒπœÉœÑŒ≠œÅŒπŒ±) - love song *Oh, that the mountains had been lowered (ŒëœÇ œáŒ±ŒºŒÆŒªœâŒΩŒ±ŒΩ œÑŒ± Œ≤ŒøœÖŒΩŒ¨) - love song *A lady called me (ŒúŒµ ŒºŒÆŒΩœÖœÉŒµ ŒºŒπŒ± Œ±œÅœáœåŒΩœÑŒπœÉœÉŒ±) - love song *Famous Macedonia (military march from the Balkan wars adapted from the traditional 'Macedonian dance', itself a derivation of an Acritic song, written in iambic decapentasyllabic - today serves as the anthem of the region of Macedonia) * They will never take the Macedonians' land (ŒîŒµŒΩ Œ∏Œ± œÑŒ∑ŒΩ œÄŒ¨œÅŒøœÖŒΩŒµ œÄŒøœÑŒ≠ œÑŒ∑ŒΩ Œ≥Œ∑ œÑœâŒΩ ŒúŒ±Œ∫ŒµŒ¥œåŒΩœâŒΩ) - patriotic song from Balkan Wars * Tzouvanaki: wedding song from Thessaloniki * We were three brothers: wedding song from Thessaloniki * Lenio: local \\"butcher's song\\" from Assiros * The quiet one: wedding dance * Sultana: song from Pylaia * Konstantinos: old folk song from Ossa, Thessaloniki * As many mountains as I passed: lounge song * Mother, a silver klontiri: wedding song from Serres * They put me in prison: Table song from Serres * Bulgarian women go up: Song from Serres * The castle of Mourias: Byzantine folk song from * Turks in Toumba: Slavic language song from Florina * Oh, Royal Tree: Lament from Eratyra about the Fall of Constantinople ==Folk dances== The use of brass instruments (ch√°lkina) is notable in the music of the region Folk dances in the Macedonian region of Greece include: * Akritikos * Baidouska * Endeka Kozanis * Kastorianos * Leventikos * Makedonia (dance) * Makedonikos antikristos * Kori Eleni (Eleno Mome) * O Nikolos * Partalos * Proskinitos * Syrtos * Zaharoula ==See also== *Music of Southeastern Europe Category:Greek music Category:Macedonian music Category:Macedonia (Greece) ","title":"Music of Macedonia (Greece)"},{"id":"12361732","text":"Prehistoric Thailand may be traced back as far as 1,000,000 years ago from the fossils and stone tools found in northern and western Thailand. At an archaeological site in Lampang, northern Thailand Homo erectus fossils, Lampang Man, dating back 1,000,000 ‚Äì 500,000 years, have been discovered. Stone tools have been widely found in Kanchanaburi, Ubon Ratchathani, Nakhon Si Thammarat, and Lopburi. Prehistoric cave paintings have also been found in these regions, dating back 10,000 years. ==2,500,000 - 10,000 years ago: Palaeolithic== Early Stone Age The Lower Palaeolithic is the earliest subdivision of the Palaeolithic or Old Stone Age. It spans the time from around 2.5 million years ago, when the first craft and use of stone tools by hominids appears in the archaeological record, until around 120,000 years ago when important evolutionary and technological changes ushered in the Middle Palaeolithic. Early species The earliest hominids, known as Homo erectus and recognisable as human, appear in the archaeological record between 1,000,000-500,000 years ago. Locally typified by the fossil, Lampang Man. About 1,000,000 years ago, Homo erectus moved to Asia from Africa, where it had originated. Its use and control of fire was an important tool in its hunter-gatherer means of subsistence. Homo erectus's skull was smaller and thicker than that of modern human beings. It lived in the mouth of caves near streams or other water supplies. Its main natural enemies included the giant hyena Hyaena sinesis, the sabre-toothed tiger, the orang-utan, and the giant panda. In 1999, Somsak Pramankit claimed to have found skull fragments of Homo erectus in Ko Kha, Lampang, though most scholars do not recognize these finds as credible. It was comparable to the skull fossils of Sangiran II Man found in Java, (Java man), which is 400,000 - 800,000 years old, as well as Peking Man. Stone artefacts dating to 40,000 years ago have been found at Tham Lod Rockshelter in Mae Hong Son. Relation to modern Thai people Modern Thais are not descendants of Lampang Man. Genetic research supports this assertion. Geneticists have proved that there was no inter-breeding between modern human immigrants to Southeast Asia and Homo erectus,Mapping human history p.130-131. affirming that the Thai descended from Africans in accordance with the Recent single-origin hypothesis.Multiregional or single origin. ==10,000 - 4,000 years ago: Neolithic== New Stone Age The Neolithic or \\"New\\" Stone Age was a period in the development of human technology that is traditionally the last part of the Stone Age. The Neolithic era follows the terminal Holocene Epipalaeolithic periods, beginning with the rise of farming, which produced the \\"Neolithic Revolution\\" and ending when metal tools became widespread in the Copper Age (chalcolithic) or Bronze Age or developing directly into the Iron Age, depending on geographical region. At the Khao Toh Chong rockshelter in Krabi archaeologists have found evidence of a change in diet leading up to domestication due to changes in sea levels. Recent archaeological excavations suggests that domesticated rice was introduced to central Thailand by immigrating rice farming societies about 4000 B.P.Higham, C.F.W. and T. Higham. 2009.

Prehistory Ban Chiang () is an archaeological site in Nong Han District, Udon Thani Province. Dating of the artefacts using the thermoluminescence technique resulted in 4420-3400 BCE dates. The oldest graves found contain no bronze and are therefore from a Neolithic culture, the most recent ones are from the Iron Age.Charles Higham (archaeologist)Higham, Charles, Prehistoric Thailand, , pp.84-88. * Khok Phanom Di Khok Phanom Di is in east Thailand near the flood plain of the Bang Pakong River in Chonburi Province. This site was populated from 2000-1500 BCE. Seven mortuary phases were identified in the excavation, including 154 graves, yielding abundant archaeological remains, such as fish, crab, hearths, post holes, and the burials of adults and infants.Halcrow, S., Tayles, N., Inglis, R., Higham, C., Carver, M. (2012). Newborn twins from prehistoric mainland Southeast Asia: birth, death and personhood.Antiquity, 86(333). By analysing the change in mortuary practices and the isotopes of strontium, carbon, and oxygen found within dental remains, archaeologists have examined the possibility of integration between an inland agriculture with the coastal hunter-gathers of Khok Phanom Di. The isotopic studies showed that in earlier phases, the female inhabitants in the site were immigrants from both inland and coastal areas, while males were raised locally. The localisation of the immigrants occurred during phase 4 and later, with rice growing increased in the same period. * Khao Rakian Khao Rakian is in Rhattaphum District, Songkhla Province, peninsular Thailand. The cave was excavated in 1986 by the Fine Arts Department and revealed Neolithic ceramics, stone tools, and human skeletal remains. ==2,500 years ago: Bronze Age== Ban Chiang pottery in the Museum f√ºr Indische Kunst, Berlin-Dahlem An earthenware water buffalo from Lopburi, 2300 BCE Copper and Bronze Age The Bronze Age was a period in civilisation's development when the most advanced metalworking consisted of techniques for smelting copper and tin from naturally occurring outcroppings of ore, and then alloying those metals to cast bronze. There are claims of an earlier appearance of tin bronze in Thailand in the 5th millennium BCE. Bronze Age settlements in Thailand * Ban Chiang In Ban Chiang, bronze artefacts have been discovered dating to 2100 BCE. The earliest grave was about 2100 BCE, the most recent about 200 CE. The evidence of crucibles and bronze fragments have been found in this area. The bronze objects include ornaments, spearheads, axes and adzes, hooks, blades, and little bells. ==1,700 years ago: Iron Age== The Iron Age was the stage in the development of people in which tools and weapons whose main ingredient was iron were prominent. People made tools from bronze before they figured out how to make them from iron because iron's melting point is higher than that of bronze or its components. The adoption of this material coincided with other changes in some past societies, often including differing agricultural practices, religious beliefs and artistic styles, although this was not always the case. Archaeological sites in Thailand, such as None Nok Tha, Lopburi Artillery centre, Ong Ba Cave and Ban Don Ta Phet show iron implements in the period between 3,400-1,700 years ago The Iron Age settlements in Thailand * Non Nok Tha Non Nok Tha () is an archaeological site in Phu Wiang District, Khon Kaen Province, northeastern Thailand, dating from 1420 to 50 BCE. * Lopburi Artillery centre Lopburi Artillery centre () is an archaeological site in Mueang District, Lopburi Province, northeastern Thailand, dating from 1225 to 700 BCE. * Ong Ba Cave Ong Ba Cave () is an archaeological site in Sri Sawat District, Kanchanaburi Province, western Thailand, dating from 310 to 150 BCE. * Ban Don Ta Phet Ban Don Ta Phet () is an archaeological site in Phanom Thuan District, Kanchanaburi Province, western Thailand, dating from 24 BCE to 276 CE.

It is the area in which Auckland was established in 1840, by William Hobson. The CBD is one of the most densely developed places in New Zealand, with many commercial and some residential developments packed into a space of only . The area is made up of the city's largest concentration of skyscrapers and businesses. Bounded by several major motorways and by the harbour coastline in the north, it is surrounded further out by mostly suburban areas; it is bounded on the North by WaitematƒÅ Harbour, east by Parnell, southeast by Grafton, south by Mount Eden, southwest by Newton, west by Freemans Bay and northwest by Viaduct Harbour. ==Geography== Located on the northern shore of a narrow isthmus, the CBD extends from the Auckland waterfront on the WaitematƒÅ Harbour southwards along Queen Street and a number of other parallel-running streets. The CBD is generally considered to be bounded by the main motorways that surround all non-harbour sides, with State Highway 1 forming the southern and western boundaries, and State Highway 16 / Grafton Gully forming the eastern boundary. The CBD has an area of , similar to the Sydney CBD, and twice as large as the CBDs of Wellington and Christchurch.Auckland's CBD at a glance (CBD website of the Auckland City Council) The CBD is to a substantial part located on reclaimed land of the WaitematƒÅ Harbour. For a closer discussion of this aspect, see the Commercial Bay and Auckland waterfront articles. ==History== The Dilworth Building, one of the few remaining stately older buildings along Queen Street The town of Auckland was created in 1840 with the first European colonisation of the area, marked by an official ceremony on the now non-existent Point Britomart. The initial centre of the new town was focused on what is now the corner of Shortland and Queen Streets, which was at the shoreline of Commercial Bay. From approximately their junction, the main wharf ran north off the end of Queen Street, with Shortland Street leading up to Fort Britomart and Government House, around which many of the richer people built houses. Shortland Street tended to be the location of the more important businesses and most of the 'luxury' shops of the mid 19th century. The 1850s onwards saw an increasing number of businesses, and especially retail, locating further south along Queen Street, which still to this day forms the 'spine' of the area. In 1841, one year after the European founding, the census counted approximately 2,000 people, with \\"mechanics\\" the largest group at 250, and other groups of note being 150 agricultural labourers, 100 shopkeepers, 100 domestic servants, and 125 \\"upper class members\\". During the remainder of the 19th century, Commercial Bay was progressively filled in, allowing a northward extension of Queen Street and the creation of Fort Street, Customs Street, and Quay Street. The part of Queen Street north of Customs Street is today referred to informally as Lower Queen Street. As well as being the location of a great many multi-storey warehouses, initially the Lower Queen Street area also contained many manufacturing businesses, though many of these started to move to other areas such as Freeman's Bay, Newton and Parnell, especially if they took up a large area (such as timber yards) or created noise or pollution (such as brick yards or foundries). Up until the middle of the 20th century the centre of town still contained a large number of small factories including clothing manufacturers. The relocation of industries to outlying suburbs became especially pronounced in the 1950s, partly due to incentives made by council planners to create industrial areas in Penrose and Rosebank Road (amongst others) and thus rid the inner city area of noise, pollution and heavy traffic. This was mirrored by the development of suburban shopping malls (the first being LynnMall in 1963) which enticed retailers to vacate the inner city as well. Attempts by the council to halt this pattern by constructing numerous public car parking buildings met with varying success. The rise of suburban supermarket and mall shopping that was created in places such as Pakuranga from 1965 onwards has been added to by the appearance of Big Box retailers in places such as Botany and the North Shore.New Zealand Historical Atlas - McKinnon, Malcolm (Editor). David Bateman, 1997. Plate 75 Residential numbers in the inner city (including the inner suburbs) were also declining in the 20th century from as early as the 1920s. In the two-mile zone surrounding the CBD, there were approximately 70,000 people in 1926, with only around 50,000 in 1966 - a change made even more marked by the development of the remainder of Auckland's population, which grew more than fourfold in the same timeframe. In the 1990s, only a token population of around 1,400 was still residing within the CBD, though this was to grow substantially with a boom of new apartment buildings around the turn of the millennium.See 'Population' section in this article. More recently, in the early 21st century the CBD has seen a resurgence with strong population growth. there were around 24,000 apartment units. the CBD is growing at six times the rate of the overall region. ==Characteristics== Aerial view of the CBD The CBD economy is dominated by Ports of Auckland and by business and financial support services. Overview The CBD of Auckland has been the leading centre of New Zealand's business and economic development for nearly two centuries. The area of today's CBD was the site of the original European settlement of Auckland, oriented along the coastline and then Queen Street, in a southward direction. From those origins, it has grown progressively, and become much more densely built-up, now being an area of high-rise buildings mainly used for commercial and retail uses. It has the highest concentration of arts, culture and higher education institutions and venues in the country. Some commentators have noted that the recent decades have not been kind to the aesthetics and the community values of the inner city. The demolishing of many older buildings, often the prerequisite for low-quality or uninspired new office and residential developments, is considered by them to be due to a combination of developers uninterested in long-term outcomes and Council planning direction being too weak.Michael Stevens: Leaders stand by as city is desecrated - The New Zealand Herald, Thursday, 3 May 2007 In an attempt to reverse the decline of aesthetics in the CBD, previous Auckland City Councils and the current unitary Auckland Council have instigated several urban regeneration schemes. These include the recent redevelopment of Aotea Square in 2010 and the upgrade of Saint Patrick's Square in 2009. The area east of the Britomart Transport Centre is currently undergoing major changes, with the development of new commercial buildings, development of public spaces and restoration of several heritage buildings. Another major regeneration scheme currently underway is the redevelopment of Wynyard Quarter, which involves replacing industrial facilities covering a large portion of the CBD waterfront with residential or commercial buildings and public spaces. The Auckland CBD is one of the few places in New Zealand that has skyscraper-sized buildings, such as the Vero Centre, ANZ Centre or the Metropolis, with the Sky Tower rising above them. Population Residential high-density buildings constructed within the last decade have helped to increase the population living in the CBD to around 40,000 (2010 estimate) from earlier 16,000 (2004 estimate), all being growth from only 1,400 in 1991.About the CBD (CBD website of the Auckland City Council) Much of this growth has been driven by immigration to New Zealand, particularly from Asia, and the CBD is the area in New Zealand with the highest percentage share (32%) of the Asian ethnic group in New Zealand.Auckland City CBD PESTE analysis (CBD website of the Auckland City Council) Also striking is the high number of students (both tertiary education and overseas students studying English in one of the many institutes), making up 27% of all residents (2001 Census) and contributing to the relative youth of the city residents.Residents of Auckland's CBD (CBD website of the Auckland City Council) With increasing population, available services have also changed - from only about one superette in the early 2000s, this has ballooned to one supermarket and 38 superettes by 2011. In early 2012, two major supermarket chains opened a branch in the city centre, with Countdown opening on Victoria Street in January and New World opening a branch on Queen Street in early March. However, the population remains highly focused on ethnically diverse, mostly young and childless residents. According to an in-depth study of security perception in the Auckland CBD undertaken in 2005, most visitors and locals feel safe visiting and living in the CBD. Police and the Council have in part ascribed these positive feelings to over a dozen safety initiatives undertaken by authorities (from alcohol bans in parts of the CBD to CCTV surveillance and street lighting measures). However, in spite of the general perception of the CBD being safe, there was a feeling that crime had risen somewhat in the last five years (whereas in fact numbers had declined). This was considered to be mostly due to a media-driven public image.Most feel Auckland CBD safe, survey shows (from a New Zealand Police press release, Tuesday 4 October 2006. Accessed 2008-02-18.) Late 2000s apartment block on Nelson Street, considered by some to be an \\"eyesore\\". Many of these buildings saw strong criticism ‚Äì and sometimes lack of tenant interest ‚Äì due to perceived problems with building quality, lack of urban design and too-small unit sizes (with a bylaw banning very small units coming in only in 2005). ==Economy== With 8,500 businesses, the CBD accounts for 18% of all businesses in Auckland City, with the largest being Ports of Auckland, and the largest employment sectors being financial services, business and ICT services. The CBD is also the largest employment centre in New Zealand, with around 65,000 jobs, representing 13% of the regional workforce, and 25% of the Auckland City workforce. Around 73,000 people enter the CBD every morning between 7 am and 9 am, 60% of these by car, while the total 'turnover' is around 270,000 people per day.A day in the life of Auckland's CBD (CBD website of the Auckland City Council. Accessed 2008-02-18.) In 2003 many large corporations were housed in the Auckland CBD. During the same year, an Auckland City report stated that the Auckland CBD, compared to several central business districts in Australia, had \\"a broader and more dominant role in its regional economy\\" compared to the economies of the Australian central business districts.\\"The Economy of Auckland‚Äôs Central Business District .\\" City of Auckland. September 2003. Executive Summary (5/77). Retrieved on 7 September 2009. The CBD remains attractive to shops, partially due to the very high pedestrian numbers on the main shopping streets like Queen Street, where footfalls are estimated to be up to 10 times as high as on Broadway in Newmarket, seen as Queen Street's closest rival. Auckland CBD has a higher share of employment in large firms than other areas in Auckland. Over half of the large firms in Auckland CBD are in office-based sectors (such as property and business services and finance and insurance) and are in the Downtown and Waterfront areas of the CBD. In 2004 Auckland CBD had 72,540 employees and 9125 businesses. 2006 Auckland CBD had 78,444 employees and 9,461 businesses.\\"CBD facts and figures .\\" City of Auckland. Retrieved on 26 August 2009.

These services are concentrated around the Britomart Transport Centre (rail and buses) and the nearby Auckland Ferry Terminal, both near the Auckland waterfront. Many bus services travel the length of the CBD along the main streets, in particular via the bus lanes on Albert Street and the Central Connector bus priority route. In 2010, around 33,000 people entered the CBD via public transport every day. Historically, much of the transport to and around the CBD post-1950s was by private vehicles, partly because the CBD provides numerous parking buildings and parking spaces associated with office buildings, and is almost totally surrounded (and easily accessible) by motorways. Auckland Council has begun the construction phase of the City Rail Link. Once completed, it will connect the Britomart transport hub more directly to the Western Line in the vicinity of Mount Eden Train Station by way of a tunnel running under the CBD. Two new stations will be constructed, one named Aotea in Aotea Square and one named Karangahape on Karangahape Road, and the existing stations at each end of the link, Britomart and Mount Eden, will receive substantial upgrades. The main street of the CBD is Queen Street, which was upgraded between 2006 and 2008 to modernise it and make it more pedestrian friendly. In 2009, the former Auckland City Council proposed the redevelopment of several CBD streets into shared spaces, with the goal of improving pedestrian and cyclist amenity by slowing down vehicle traffic while retaining the possibility for car access - compared to a pedestrian mall which allows no motor vehicles.\\"Auckland: the new Copenhagen? \\". National Business Review. 25 May 2009. Auckland Council is continuing this project. Darby Street, Lorne Street, Fort Street, Jean Batten Place, and Fort Lane have been converted into shared spaces since 2011.

The train runs across southern India from Andhra Pradesh to Karnataka. * 18047 Howrah - Vasco da Gama Amaravati Express * 18048 Vasco da Gama - Howrah Amaravati Express This service runs four times a week each way. It operates via Visakhapatnam, Vijayawada, Guntur, Nandyal, Guntakal, Bellary, Hospet, Gadag, Hubli, Dharwad, Londa, Madgaon. This service is operated by the South Eastern Railway (SER), Kharagpur Division. The train travels from West Bengal through Orissa and Andhra Pradesh in the east of India to Karnataka and Goa in the south-west of India. The Amaravati Express is popular with the inhabitants of Andhra Pradesh particularly those living in the cities and towns of Guntur, Narasaraopet, Markapur, Cumbum, Giddaluru, Nandyal, Mahanandi, Guntakal and Bellary and the surrounding regions. ==History== The Amaravati Express runs on the historical Machilipatnam-Mormugao railway track. The service was first introduced during the 1950s as the meter gauge train between Guntur and Hubli. The Guntur-Hubli fast passenger service was upgraded to an express service between 1987 and 1990 and was then named the Amaravati Express. The train coaches were hauled by a YP steam locomotive and had a slip coach from Vasco da Gama to Guntur. This slip coach to Guntur was attached to the Gomantak Express along with slip coaches to Gadag. These slip coaches were then attached to the Miraj Gadag link express at Londa and the slip coach to Guntur was then attached to the Hubli Guntur fast passenger service at Gadag. This practice of attaching/detaching the slip coaches was discontinued at Gadag and instead the slip coaches went as far as Hubli after the introduction of the Amaravati Express. This practice continued until the gauge conversion work started in the mid-1990s and the train tracks were standardised in 1997. The train service was extended to Vijayawada in 1994. While the gauge conversion activities were taking place in the mid 1990s, the train service was split into different segments and the full service was not fully restored until 1997. By the beginning of 2000, the train service had been extended to Londa Junction, Castle Rock and eventually to Vasco da Gama as the gauge conversion progressed. The train was finally commissioned as a daily train between Vasco da Gama and Vijayawada in the mid-2000. But due to a poor response from passengers, the frequency was reduced to bi-weekly and for the remaining 5 days the train terminated at Hubli. From the beginning of 2003, the service frequency increased to three times a week and the Vijayawada-Hubli services operated on the remaining four days each week. From July 2007, the train service from Vasco da Gama was further extended to Howrah. In 2010 the 7225/7226 Vijayawada - Hubli service was renumbered as 17225/17226 and the 8047/8048 Howrah - Vasco da Gama service was renumbered as 18047/18048. On 12 February 2013, Railway minister mallikarjuna karge increased the frequency of Amaravathi Express 17225/17226 which runs between Hubli-Vijayawada from 3 days to daily. As per revised time table new train timings come into operation very soon. ==Origin of Name== The train service is named after the historical capital city of the Satavahana Dynasty, Amaravati in the present day Guntur District. Amaravati is also known as the Sanchi of South India because of its stupas. ==Locomotives== The 17225/17226 Amaravati Express uses WDP4D Diesel locomotives from the Gooty Shed of SCR between Vijayawada and Hubli. The 18047/18048 Amaravati Express uses both electric and diesel locomotives.

Parker (1830‚Äì1915) was the brother of Cynthia Ann Parker and the uncle of Comanche chief Quanah Parker. An Anglo-Texas man of Scots-Irish descent who was kidnapped from his natural family at the age of five by a Native American raiding party, he returned to the Native American people of his own free will after being ransomed back from the Comanche. He was a member of the large Parker frontier family that settled in east Texas in the 1830s. He was captured in 1836 by Comanches during the raid of Fort Parker near present-day Groesbeck, Texas. ==Birth and early years== John Parker was born in 1830 in Crawford County, Illinois, the second oldest child of Silas Mercer Parker (1804‚Äì1836) and Lucinda Duty. His younger siblings were Silas Mercer Jr., and Orlena. His older sister was Cynthia Ann Parker. This family and allied families, led by Silas' father John and brother Daniel, moved from Illinois to Texas in 1833. A large group under the family patriarch, Elder John Parker, settled near the headwaters of the Navasota River in present-day Limestone County. In 1834 they completed Fort Parker for their protection on the frontier. On May 19, 1836, a large force of Comanche and allied warriors attacked the fort, and in what became known as the Fort Parker Massacre killed five men and captured two women and three children: Parker, his sister Cynthia Ann, Rachel Plummer and her son James Pratt Plummer as well as Elizabeth Duty Kellogg.Exley, J.A.. Frontier Blood: The Saga of the Parker Family Captivity The Comanche's population had increased in large part by adopting captured women and children into the tribe, the former as child- bearing slaves and the latter as tribal members. The Comanche made little distinction from tribal members born into the tribe, and those adopted in. Children under puberty were tested for intelligence, strength and courage, and if they seemed acceptable in all, they were adopted into the tribe and taught to be warriors.Fehrenbach, T.R. Comanches, The Destruction of a People Grown men captured alive were generally killed, while females over puberty could expect gang rape and slavery. Elizabeth Duty Kellogg was quickly ransomed from the relatively benign Delaware Indians by Sam Houston. Rachel Plummer endured nearly two years of captivity among the Comanche, and never saw her oldest child, James Pratt Plummer, again. Her second child, born six months after her kidnapping, was murdered by the Comanche, who claimed that the child interfered with her work. Parker was raised by the Comanche, as were his sister and younger cousin, James Pratt Plummer. The two boys were ransomed back in 1842. Plummer was returned to his grandfather and was able to readapt to white society,TSHA Online - Texas State Historical Association - Home at www.tshaonline.org but Parker was unable to readapt and ran away from his family to return to the Comanches. ==In Mexico== As did most young Comanche, Parker participated in many raids into Mexico during the September full moon, the \\"Comanche Moon,\\" when the dreaded Comanche raids devastated Mexico all the way to Central America. On one of the raids, he contracted smallpox.The Story of Cynthia Ann Parker at www.rootsweb.com, Cynthia Ann Parker. The Comanche were returning from the raid with captives, horses, and other plunder, but they stopped briefly when Parker became too ill to ride, somewhere just north of the Rio Grande in West Texas. The Comanche were terrified that they, too, would catch this dreaded killer, which had killed over half the tribe during the epidemic years, and they left Parker to ride out the illness, leaving a girl they had captured on the raid to take care of him. Rather than leave to try to return to her family, the girl nursed Parker back to health. He then returned to Mexico with the girl and restored her to her home and family. He later married her. ==Later life== Parker returned to the United States during the Civil War and served with Confederate troops in Texas. After the war, he returned to Mexico, where he died in 1915 on his ranch. He appeared to have been the only one of the Parker children who lived a happy life. The actor William Smith played Parker in the 1969 episode \\"The Understanding\\" of the syndicated television series, Death Valley Days, hosted not long before his death by Robert Taylor. In the story line, Parker contracts the plague, is left for dead by his fellow Comanche warriors, and is rescued by his future wife, Yolanda (Emily Banks), a Mexican. ==FootnotesReferences== * Fehrenbach, Theodore Reed The Comanches: The Destruction of a People.

Pensioners resident in Britain, receive an annual uprating known as the \\"triple lock\\" - the higher of the increase in CPI (price inflation), average earnings growth, or 2.5%.. However, if the pensioner moves abroad, the annual uprating depends on where they live, with residents of most countries receiving no annual uprating.. The only other countries in which the UK state pension rises in the same way as UK state pensioners are: European Union countries, Switzerland, Barbados; Bermuda; Bosnia-Herzegovina; Guernsey; Isle of Man; Israel; Jamaica; Jersey; Mauritius; Montenegro; North Macedonia; the Philippines; Serbia; Turkey; and the United States of America. ‚àí links to PDF of Briefing Paper Number CBP-01457, Frozen overseas pensions by Djuna Thurley and Rod McInnes Most British Commonwealth countries are included in the frozen list.Leaflet NP46, DWP Note: no longer available - see ==Challenges== In April 2002, Annette Carson, a UK pensioner resident in South Africa, challenged the policy in the High Court under the Human Rights Act 1998 in April 2002 in the High Court, but the judge ruled against her, stating in the judgement that the upratings issue was a political one, not a judicial one. An appeal to the Court of Appeal (2003) failed, as did an appeal to the House of Lords (2005) and the European Court of Human Rights (2008). A subsequent referral to the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights in 2009‚Äì2010 said that it did not consider that the applicants resident outside the UK in countries not party to reciprocal agreements, were in a relevantly similar position to residents of the UK or of countries which did have such agreements. It therefore held (by eleven votes to six) that there had been no discrimination. During and since that time, various groups and individuals have been lobbying politicians both in the UK and in the countries in which the pensioners are resident, and petitions have been raised. There is an international consortium of lobby groups, funded by the member organisations, British Pensions in Australia (BPIA) and the Canadian Alliance of British Pensioners (CABP). Funds are raised by the memberships and donations of individual members. BPIA and CABP jointly own the International Consortium of British Pensioners (ICBP), and they liaise with the All Party Parliamentary Group on Frozen Pensions (APPG) in the UK Parliament.

As an amateur, de Jes√∫s represented the island of Puerto Rico in international events, including the 2003 Pan American Games, the 2002 Central American and Caribbean Games and the 2004 Summer Olympics. Early in his career, he won seven regional titles: the World Boxing Organization Latino lightweight title, World Boxing Council Caribbean Boxing Federation lightweight title, World Boxing Association Fedecaribe Lightweight title, WBO Latino light welterweight title, WBA Fedecaribe Welterweight title, WBC Latino light welterweight title and the WBA Fedebol light welterweight title. == Biography == During the 2004 Athens Olympic Games, De Jes√∫s became the first Puerto Rican to win an Olympic boxing fight since Daniel Santos earned a bronze medal at the 1996 Atlanta, Georgia games. De Jes√∫s defeated Brazilian Myke Carvalho by decision during the first round of the competition to achieve that accomplishment. In the second round, however, he lost by one point (23-24), to Sam Rukundo from Uganda. De Jes√∫s' nickname used to be \\"El Pollo Whitaker\\", meaning \\"Chicken Whitaker\\". \\"El Pollo\\" was given to him by his parents because he was a very small child. \\"Whitaker\\" was given to him by his trainers at the boxing gym, because they thought Alexander's style of fighting was reminiscent of the one presented by Pernell Whitaker. He announced just before the Olympics, however, that he was dropping off the \\"Whitaker\\" part from his nickname because he wanted to form his own identity as a boxer. == Professional career == Alex de Jes√∫s debuted as a professional in a boxing card that took place in Bayam√≥n, Puerto Rico on January 29, 2005. This fight was against Ruben Mesorrama who was also debuting and it ended on the second round when de Jes√∫s won by knockout. De Jes√∫s' next fight was against Alejandro Alicea on March 4, 2005. This event was held in Hato Rey, Puerto Rico and the contest ended in the third round when de Jes√∫s won by technical knockout.

In this fight de Jes√∫s won three regional titles these were: the WBO Latino Lightweight title, WBC Caribbean Boxing Federation lightweight title and the WBA Fedecaribe lightweight title. Alex returned to action on July 20, 2007 against Arturo Morua, in a fight he won dy unanimous decision. In this fight de Jes√∫s won his fourth and fifth regional titles: the WBO Latino welterweight title and the WBA Fedecaribe welterweight title. De Jes√∫s was then active in a fight that would be used as an elimination to determine the first contender for the World Boxing Organization's light welterweight division title against Bulmaro Solis in a contest that he won by knockout in the fourth round. Alex was unable to make the accorded weight prior to this fight which led to Solis' receiving an amount of money that was equivalent to the amount of pounds over the limit. Following this event de Jes√∫s was scheduled to fight Steve Qui√±ones in a card that took place on December 7, 2007. Prior to the event de Jes√∫s noted that the training for the fight was the most intense in his career, he stated that he wanted to win regional titles in three different weight divisions in order to challenge Ricardo Torres for the WBO light welterweight championship. The Fight card was presented by All Star Boxing and it was organized in Miami, Florida. De Jes√∫s defeated Qui√±ones by unanimous decision and won the vacant WBC Latino light welterweight title. The three judges awarded Alex scores of 116-112, 117-111 and 115-113. On April 5, 2008 de Jesus successfully defended the WBO regional title against Wilfredo Negron. De Jes√∫s displayed more fluid boxing throughout the fight, in the process scoring a knockdown in the third. The contest was stopped in the final round when Negron was unable to recover after one of de Jesus's combinations connected behind his ear. In this fight he won the vacant WBA Fedebol light welterweight title. De Jes√∫s returned to action on August 8, 2008, defeating Adri√°n Navarrete by technical knockout. As part of a card titled \\"The First Step\\" which featured Juan Manuel L√≥pez's first world championship defense, De Jes√∫s defeated Jos√© Antonio Izquierdo by technical knockout. Izquierdo was more active in the offensive during the early rounds, but De Jes√∫s established control of the fight's tempo from the third onwards. After receiving three knockdowns, Izquierdo's corner threw in the towel following the last of these. On March 20, 2009, De Jes√∫s lost for the first time as a professional, losing by unanimous decision to C√©sar Ren√© Cuenca in a result that was described as \\"controversial\\". ==Outside the ring== From 2009 to 2013, De Jesus served a four-year prison sentence on domestic violence charges. His charges included violating a protective order against his wife and kids, and he served his time in a Bayamon, Puerto Rico jail.http://www.boxingscene.com/?m=show&id;=30001 On April 2, 2016, in San Juan, De Jes√∫s was charged for allegedly attacking his stepmother.

He is the second child in a family of five. His mother is actress and journalist, Catherine Belkhodja of French and Algerian ancestry, while his father is of Breton and Vietnamese descent. He has worked on many occasions with his brother and sisters, with whom he collaborates on a regular basis as chief cameraman. He has video captured the live theatre performance of Pois chiche by Ma√Øwenn Le Besco, one of his sisters, also an actress and director, twice nominated for a C√©sar Award in 2007 for her first film Pardonnez-moi. He also played with his sister Isild Le Besco in ', a film featuring Catherine Deneuve. He was chief cameraman in two films written and directed by Isild: Demi-tarif, produced by their sister Leonor Graser and independent French film production company Karedas, featuring their younger brother Kolia Litscher in a main role, and Charly, also produced by Isild, on which he collaborated again with Isild and Kolia. ==Career== A former pupil of Lyc√©e Charlemagne and Lyc√©e Victor Hugo in Paris, two secondary schools renowned for their academic excellence, Jowan started cinema studies at the Paris Sorbonne University of Jussieu, during which he directed a large number of short films. An award received for one of his short films won him editing software, which he used in a number of music video clips. He then decided to further his studies at the Lyon Institut Lumi√®re and Paris Gobelins School. He took part in Isild's first short film produced by SOPADIN (a scriptwriting competition organisation), and went on by taking charge of photography in Demi-tarif, which won an award for best Junior script. Given their young age - both were under 20, Jowan and Isild had experienced the greatest difficulty finding a producer for this project. KAREDAS decided to trust them: as a result, the film was presented at over fifty festivals and widely acclaimed by film critics. Even though he has occasionally held roles as an actor, Jowan's objective has always been to stick to film photography training. To this end, he studied with St√©phane Marty, later with Caroline Champetier during the making of L'Intouchable, shot in India where he was in charge of capturing the cremation scenes. With the success of Demi-tarif, he was able to prepare Isild's second film Charly with greater ease, as the project was funded by an advance on future box-office receipts from the CNC, as well as receiving the support of Arte.The film is to be released on 12 September 2007. Following an extended solitary stay in an Indian monastery, he brought back Yapo, a documentary that was selected for the 29th Cin√©ma du R√©el Documentary Festival, a yearly event for ethnological or social documentary films organised by the Pompidou Centre in Paris. ==Filmography== Feature films * 1999 : La Puce by Emmanuelle Bercot (actor) * 2002 : Un moment de bonheur by Antoine Santana (actor) * 2004 : √Ä tout de suite by Beno√Æt Jacquot (assistant) * 2004 : ' by Beno√Æt Jacquot (actor) * 2006 : L'Intouchable by Beno√Æt Jacquot (cameraman - assistant/second team) * 2007 : Yapo by Jowan Le Besco (scriptwriter, director, chief cameraman, editor) * 2007 : ' by Isild Le Besco (chief cameraman) Short films * 1999 : Cinematon by G√©rard Courant (actor) * 2003 : Quelqu'un vous aime (assistant) Television ==Theatre== * 2004 : Le Pois chiche by Ma√Øwenn Le Besco at the Caf√© de la Gare theatre, with Ma√Øwenn (video capture) ==Awards== (for Demi-tarif) * 2000: Award for best Junior script at the Paris Film Festival for Demi-tarif (as camera operator) * 2004 : Special Jury Award for Demi-tarif at the European First Film Festival of Angers (as chief cameraman) * 2004 : Procirep - Premiers Plans Award for Demi-tarif at Angers (as chief cameraman) * 2004 : Special Jury Award for Demi-tarif at Seoul Festival (as chief cameraman) * 2004: Jury Award for Demi-tarif at the Crossing Europe Festival of Linz (as chief cameraman) * 2004 : Demi-tarif nominated for Louis Delluc Award (as chief cameraman) ==ReferencesExternal links== * * for Jowan's photos and posters * Jowan on Unifrance website Category:1981 births Category:Living people Category:University of Paris alumni Category:French male film actors Category:French people of Algerian descent Category:French people of Breton descent Category:French people of Vietnamese descent Category:Male actors from Paris ","title":"Jowan Le Besco"},{"id":"12362074","text":"Mamer Lyc√©e may refer to: * Lyc√©e Technique Josy Barthel, a school in Mamer, in south-western Luxembourg * Mamer Lyc√©e railway station, a railway station serving the school ","title":"Mamer Lyc√©e"},{"id":"12362075","text":"The Souffel () is a river in Alsace, France.

Rarely published in the nineteenth century and sparingly even today, Memoirs is most often viewed as a source for information on Wollstonecraft. However, with the rise of interest in biography and autobiography as important genres in and of themselves, scholars are increasingly studying it for its own sake.Clemit and Walker, \\"Introduction\\".St Clair, 183‚Äì84. ==Circumstances of its writing== On 30 August 1797, Wollstonecraft gave birth to her second and Godwin's first child. Ten days later, she died of complications. The two writers had been a couple for only a short time, and Godwin was bereft: \\"I firmly believe there does not exist her equal in the world. I know from experience we were formed to make each other happy. I have not the least expectation that I can now ever know happiness again.\\" William Godwin, in a letter to Thomas Holcroft, after his wife's death, as quoted in William Godwin : His Friends and Contemporaries(1876) by Charles Kegan Paul In this frame of mind, Godwin felt it was his duty to edit and publish Wollstonecraft's unfinished works. A week after her funeral, he started on this project and a memoir of her life. In order to prepare to write the biography, he reread all of her works, spoke with her friends, and ordered and numbered their correspondence. After four months of hard work, he had completed both projects. According to William St Clair, who has written a biography of the Godwins and the Shelleys, Wollstonecraft was so famous by this time that Godwin did not have to state her name in the title of the memoir;St Clair, 180. mention of her 1792 book A Vindication of the Rights of Woman served to identify her. Published in January 1798, Godwin's account of Wollstonecraft's life is wracked with sorrow and, inspired by Jean-Jacques Rousseau's Confessions, unusually frank for its time.St Clair, 184. He did not shrink from presenting the parts of Wollstonecraft's life that late eighteenth-century British society would judge either immoral or in bad taste, such as her close friendship with a woman, her love affairs, her illegitimate child, her suicide attempts and her agonizing death.Clemit and Walker, \\"Introduction\\"St Clair, 182. In the \\"Preface\\", Godwin explains: Joseph Johnson, the publisher to both Wollstonecraft and Godwin (and through whom the couple met), tried to dissuade the memoirist from including explicit details regarding her life, but he refused.St Clair, 183. ==Reception== The book was heavily criticized and Godwin was forced to revise it for a second edition in August of the same year.St Clair, 185. Godwin's openness was not always appreciated by the people he named or by Wollstonecraft's sisters. Everina and Eliza ran a school in Ireland and they lost students as a result of the Memoir.St Clair, 182, 184. The Anti-Jacobin Review and Magazine pilloried the book, writing that \\"if it does not shew what it is wise to pursue, it manifests what it is wise to avoid. It illustrates both the sentiments and conduct resulting from such principles as those of Mrs. Wollstonecroft and Mr. Godwin. It also in some degree accounts for the formation of such visionary theories and pernicious doctrines.\\"Anti-Jacobin Review and Magazine (July 1798), 94. The review surveys Wollstonecraft's entire life and indicts almost every element of it, from her efforts to care for Fanny Blood, her close friend, to her writings. Of her two Vindications in particular, it criticizes her \\"extravagance\\" and lack of logic.Anti-Jacobin Review and Magazine (July 1798), 95. Regarding her relationship with Gilbert Imlay, the review describes her as a \\"concubine\\" and a \\"kept mistress\\" and writes, \\"the biographer does not mention many of her amours. Indeed it was unnecessary: two or three instances of action often decide a character as well as a thousand.\\"Anti- Jacobin Review and Magazine (July 1798), 97. It concludes that \\"the moral sentiments and moral conduct of Mrs. Wollstonecroft , resulting from their principles and theories, exemplify and illustrate JACOBIN MORALITY\\" and warns parents against bringing up their children using her advice.Anti-Jacobin Review and Magazine (July 1798), 98‚Äì9. ==Modern evaluation== Claudia Johnson has written that \\"Godwin's Memoirs appeared virtually to celebrate Wollstonecraft's suicidal tendencies as somehow appropriate in a heroine of her exquisite sensibility\\".Johnson, Claudia.

K. Rowling. There is a storybook of the same name mentioned in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the last book of the Harry Potter series. The book was originally produced in a limited edition of only seven copies, each handwritten and illustrated by J. K. Rowling. One of them was offered for auction through Sotheby's in late 2007 and was expected to sell for ¬£50,000 (US$77,000, ‚Ç¨69,000); ultimately it was bought for ¬£1.95 million ($3 million, ‚Ç¨2.7 million) by Amazon, making the selling price the highest achieved at auction for a modern literary manuscript. The money earned at the auction of the book was donated to The Children's Voice charity campaign. The book was published for the general public on 4 December 2008, with the proceeds going to the Children's High Level Group (renamed Lumos in 2010). ==In the Harry Potter series== Hallows found in \\"The Tale of the Three Brothers\\" The Tales of Beedle the Bard first appeared as a fictional book in J. K. Rowling's 2007 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the seventh and final novel of the Harry Potter series. The book is bequeathed to Hermione Granger by Albus Dumbledore, former headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. It is described as a popular collection of Wizarding children's fairy tales, so that while Ron Weasley is familiar with the stories, Harry Potter and Hermione Granger had not previously heard of them due to their non-magical upbringing. The book Hermione receives in Dumbledore's will is a copy of the original edition of the fictional book. It is described as an ancient-looking small book with its binding \\"stained and peeling in places\\". In the novel it is also said the book has a title on its cover, written in embossed runic symbols. The book acts as the vehicle for introducing the Deathly Hallows to the trio. Above the story \\"The Tale of the Three Brothers\\", Hermione Granger finds a strange symbol which later is revealed by Xenophilius Lovegood to be the symbol of the Hallows. The triangle from the symbol represents the Invisibility Cloak, the circle inside the triangle symbolises the Resurrection Stone, and the vertical line represents the Elder Wand. These three objects are also mentioned in the story itself (see below), and are said to belong to the Peverell brothers, who are later revealed as being both Voldemort's and Harry Potter's ancestors. Towards the end of the novel, Albus Dumbledore also confirms Harry's connection to the Peverells, and states that the three brothers might in fact have been the creators of the Hallows. The introduction (written by Rowling) to the publications released in December 2008 mentions that the fictional character Beedle the Bard was born in Yorkshire, lived in the 15th century, and had \\"an exceptionally luxuriant beard\\". ==Publication history== Rowling started writing the book soon after finishing work on the seventh Harry Potter novel. During an interview with her fandom she also stated that she used other books as a source of inspiration for the tales. More specifically, \\"The Tale of the Three Brothers\\", the only story included entirely in The Deathly Hallows, was inspired by Geoffrey Chaucer's \\"The Pardoner's Tale\\" from The Canterbury Tales. Handmade edition Originally The Tales of Beedle the Bard had only been produced in a limited number of seven handmade copies, all handwritten and illustrated by the author herself. The books were bound in brown morocco leather, and decorated with hand-chased silver ornaments and mounted semiprecious stones by silversmith and jeweller Hamilton & Inches of Edinburgh. Each of the silver pieces represents one of the five stories in the book. Rowling also asked that each of the seven copies be embellished using a different semiprecious stone. Six of these original handwritten copies were uniquely dedicated and given by Rowling to six people who were most involved with the Harry Potter series. The recipients of these copies were not initially identified. Since then, two of these people have been named. One is Barry Cunningham, Rowling's very first editor. Another is Arthur A. Levine, editor for Scholastic, the U.S. publisher of the Harry Potter books. Cunningham and Levine had lent their personal copies as part of Beedle the Bard exhibits in December 2008. Rowling also decided to create a seventh handwritten copy (distinguished from the others by its moonstone jewelling) to sell at auction in order to raise funds for The Children's Voice charity campaign. Auction The Moonstone edition of the book was auctioned in December 2007. The 157-page \\"Moonstone edition\\" of the book was first put on display prior to bidding on 26 November in New York and on 9 December in London. The book was auctioned 13 December 2007, at Sotheby's in London. The starting price was ¬£30,000 ($62,000, ‚Ç¨46,000), and originally it was expected to sell for approximately ¬£50,000 ($103,000, ‚Ç¨80,000). The closing bid far exceeded all prior projections, as ultimately the book was purchased by a representative from London fine art dealers Hazlitt Gooden and Fox on behalf of Amazon, for a total of ¬£1.95 million ($3.98 million, ‚Ç¨2.28 million). This was the highest purchase price for a modern literary manuscript at that date. The money earned at auction later was donated by Rowling to The Children's Voice charity campaign. Sotheby's printed a forty-eight-page promotional catalogue for the auction. The catalogue featured illustrations from the book, as well as comments from J. K. Rowling on The Tales of Beedle the Bard. The catalogue was sold as a collector's item, and the money from that sale also has been donated to The Children's Voice. Another copy of the same book was put into auction on November 2016. It was auctioned for ¬£368,750 on 12 December 2016. The book was auctioned by Sotheby in London. The book is a leather bound manuscript decorated with Rhodochrosite (A precious stone) and a silver skull. The copy does have a note by Rowling to Mr. Cunningham as follows ‚ÄúTo Barry, the man who thought an overlong novel about a boy wizard in glasses might just sell ‚Ä¶ THANK YOU.‚Äù She has also added a note about the stone as ‚Äútraditionally associated with love, balance and joy in daily life‚Äù. Public editions US cover of The Tales of Beedle the Bard. On 31 July 2008, it was announced The Tales of Beedle the Bard would also be made available for the public, in both standard and collector's editions. The book was published by Children's High Level Group and printed and distributed by Bloomsbury, Scholastic, and Amazon.com. The decision was taken due to disappointment among Harry Potter fans after it had initially been announced a wide public release was not intended. Similarly to Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them and Quidditch Through the Ages (two other books mentioned in the Harry Potter novels that have also been printed) the standard and collector's editions of The Tales of Beedle the Bard feature commentary and footnotes from Albus Dumbledore, headmaster of Hogwarts and one of the main characters of the series. The standard edition also includes illustrations reproduced from the handwritten edition auctioned in December 2007 and the introduction by the author. The limited collector's edition features ten illustrations by J.K. Rowling not included in the standard edition or the original handcrafted edition, as well as an exclusive reproduction of J.K. Rowling's handwritten introduction, and other miscellaneous objects such as replica gemstones and an emerald ribbon. The book, released on 4 December 2008, was published in the United Kingdom and Canada by Bloomsbury, while the US edition was published by Scholastic, and the limited collector's edition of the book, available in all three countries, by Amazon. The limited edition retailed for ¬£50 ($100, ‚Ç¨100), and around 100,000 copies have been printed. The book has been translated into 28 languages. Profits from the sale of the book were offered to the Children's High Level Group. Initial sale estimates were roughly ¬£4 million ($7.6 million, ‚Ç¨4.7 million); as of January 2010 an estimated ¬£11 million ($17 million, ‚Ç¨13 million) were generated from sales for the charity. ==Synopsis== Overview Rowling wrote five stories for the book. One, \\"The Warlock's Hairy Heart\\", is not mentioned in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows; three others, \\"The Wizard and the Hopping Pot\\", \\"The Fountain of Fair Fortune\\", and \\"Babbitty Rabbitty and her Cackling Stump\\", receive cursory attention. \\"The Tale of the Three Brothers\\" is the only story also included entirely in The Deathly Hallows. \\"The Wizard and the Hopping Pot\\" This story is about the legacy of an old man who, in his generosity, used his pot to brew magical potions and antidotes for other people when they needed his help. Upon his death, he leaves all his belongings to his only son, who has none of the virtues his father had. After his father's death, the son finds the pot and a single slipper inside it together with a note from his father that reads, \\"In the fond hope, my son, that you will never need it\\". Bitter for having nothing left but a pot, the son closes the door on every person who asks for his help. doesn't help over 5 people so each time he does so, the pot takes on the symptoms of the ones who ask for help; it starts disturbing the son and prevents him from having any peace of mind. This continues until the son finally gives up and provides aid to the town. Upon doing this, the pot's ailments are removed one by one and the son's ordeal finally ends one day when the slipper he received from his father falls out of the pot; he puts the slipper on the pot's foot and the two walk off into the sunset. \\"The Fountain of Fair Fortune\\" In this story, there is a fountain where once per year, one person may bathe to have his or her problems answered. This is how three witches meet. The first witch, Asha, suffers from an incurable disease. The second, Altheda, endures poverty and powerlessness due to a robbery. The third, Amata, is distraught after being left by her beloved. The three witches decide to try to reach the fountain together but along the way, a luckless Muggle knight, Sir Luckless, also joins them. On their path to the fountain, they face three challenges. The first involves a giant worm that demands \\"proof of [their] pain\\". The second, a steep slope where they have to bring the \\"fruit of their labours\\". The third challenge, crossing a river, requires them to pay with \\"the treasure of [their] past\\". Amata passes the challenge by using magic to withdraw the memories of her ex-lover and drop them into the water. At the fountain, Asha collapses from exhaustion. To save her, Altheda brews an invigorating potion that also cures Asha of her disease and need of the fountain. Altheda realises that her skills are a means to earn money, so she also no longer needs the fountain. Amata realises that washing away her regret for her cruel and false lover removed her need as well. Sir Luckless bathes in the water, after which he flings himself at Amata's feet and asks for \\"her hand and her heart\\" which she happily gives. Everyone gets an answer to his or her problem, unaware that the fountain held no magical power at all. \\"The Warlock's Hairy Heart\\" The story is about a young and handsome warlock who decides to never fall in love, so he uses Dark Arts to prevent himself from doing so. His family, hoping he will change, does nothing. However, one day, he hears two servants whispering about him not having a wife, so he decides to find a talented, rich, and beautiful witch and marry her to gain everyone's envy. He meets that girl the next day. Though the girl is both \\"fascinated and repelled\\", the warlock persuades her to come to a dinner feast at his castle. During the feast, she tells him that she needs to know he has a heart. The warlock shows her his beating hairy heart inside a crystal casket in his dungeon. The witch begs him to put it back inside himself. After the warlock does so, she embraces him. However, being disconnected from its body for so long, his heart has developed savage tastes as it has degenerated into an animalistic state. And so he is driven to take by force a truly human heart. He tears out the witch's heart to replace his own, but finding that he cannot magic the hairy heart back out of his chest, he cuts it out with a dagger. Thus he and the maiden both die, with him holding both hearts in his hands. \\"Babbitty Rabbitty and her Cackling Stump\\" This story is about a king who wants to keep all magic to himself. To do this he needs to solve two problems: he must capture and imprison all of the sorcerers in the kingdom and he has to learn magic. He creates a \\"Brigade of Witch Hunters\\" and calls for an instructor in magic. Only a \\"cunning charlatan\\" with no magical ability responds. The charlatan proves himself with a few simple tricks and begins to ask for jewellery and money to continue teaching. However, Babbitty, the king's washerwoman, laughs at the king one day as he attempts to do magic with an ordinary twig. This causes the king to demand the charlatan join him in a public demonstration of magic and warns that the charlatan will be beheaded if anyone laughs. The charlatan later witnesses Babbitty performing magic in her house. He threatens to expose her if she does not assist him. She agrees to hide and help the demonstration. During the performance, the brigade captain asks the king to bring his dead hound back to life. Because Babbitty cannot use magic to raise the dead, the crowd thinks the previous acts were tricks. The charlatan exposes Babbitty, accusing her of blocking the spells. Babbitty flees into a forest and disappears at the base of an old tree. In desperation, the charlatan states that she has turned \\"into a crab apple\\" and has the tree cut down. As the crowd departs, the stump starts cackling and makes the charlatan confess. The stump cackles again, demanding the king never hurt a wizard again, and build a statue of Babbitty on the stump to remind him of his foolishness. The king agrees and heads back to the palace. Afterwards, a \\"stout old rabbit\\" with a wand in its teeth hops out from a hole beneath the stump and leaves the kingdom. \\"The Tale of the Three Brothers\\" The story is about three brothers who, while traveling together, reach a treacherous river. They make a magical bridge over the river wherein just as they cross, they meet the personification of Death, who is angry for losing three potential victims. He pretends to be impressed by them and grants each a wish as a reward. The oldest brother asks for an unbeatable dueling wand, so Death gives him the Elder Wand. The middle brother asks for the ability to resurrect the dead, so Death gives him the Resurrection Stone. The youngest brother does not trust Death and asks for a way to stop Death from following him, so Death reluctantly gives him his Cloak of Invisibility. Afterward, the brothers go their separate ways. The oldest brother resolves a previous quarrel by using the wand to kill the man with whom he quarreled, but his bragging about the wand's incredible power ends with him getting robbed of it and murdered in his sleep. The middle brother resolves a previous loss by using the stone to bring back the woman to whom he wanted to be married, but the sight of her being partly alive and full of sorrow for being back in the mortal world ends with him committing suicide. The youngest brother Death never manages to find, as he stays hidden under his cloak. Many years later, the brother removes his cloak and gives it to his son. Content with the life he has lived, he greets Death as an old friend and equal. ==Reception== The Tales of Beedle the Bard received generally positive critical reception. Sotheby's deputy director Philip W. Errington described the handmade edition as \\"one of the most exciting pieces of children's literature\\" to have passed through the auction house. After buying the book, Amazon also released a review, describing it as \\"an artifact pulled straight out of a novel\\". The Times reviewed the published book favourably, calling the tales \\"funny, sinister, wise and captivating\\" and likening them to the tales collected by the Brothers Grimm. The Telegraph reviewed it unfavourably, noting that they \\"would be unremarkable were it not for the body of work that lies behind it\\" and that there was \\"an element of padding to make it a respectable length\\". ==Live show== A live puppet show of The Fountain of Fair Fortune and The Tale of the Three Brothers is presented daily at the Diagon Alley expansion of The Wizarding World of Harry Potter at Universal Studios Florida.ENTERTAINMENT AND INTERACTIVE EXPERIENCES IN THE WIZARDING WORLD OF HARRY POTTER ‚Äì DIAGON ALLEY REVEALED - Universal Orlando Blog ==Film Adaptation== After the film adaptation franchise of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them Rowling and Warner Bros. announced that a filming for the book is in addition to The Wizarding World. ==See also== * List of most expensive books and manuscripts ==References== Category:Books by J.

Large coaches are used internationally by tour operators, intercity bus lines and charters, for short and long distance destinations. These buses are larger than regular transit buses with 2 to 4 axles (6 to 10 wheels). The history of tour buses in North America began in the early 20th century when trucks were converted to provide a means for sightseeing within large American cities. Gray Line, the largest sightseeing operators began operations in 1910. Sightseeing was likely a side business for many intercity bus operators because the same types of buses were used (this remains true even today). World War II saw the industry decline, but it slowly re-emerged as an alternative to driving. Many musicians, entertainers, dancing crews and bands travel in sleeper buses, commonly referred to as \\"tour buses\\". While most if not all of the buses and coaches listed above are for commercial applications, there are many coaches manufactured for personal use as motorhomes. These bus based motorhomes are considered the top end of the RV market. ==Common features== * Padded fabric or leather front-facing seats, often reclining. * Foot and arm rests. * TV monitors connected to DVD player or VCR to provide entertainment or possibly analog TV or DTV for local news or programs (possibly in seats with viewer choosing what station). * Basic lavatory ‚Äì riders may be discouraged from using it except in an emergency, but some newer buses feature full service lavatories * Cool water dispenser, refrigerator, hot water urn. * Wheelchair lift or ramp and \\"kneeling suspension\\" for easier access (especially for the elderly and infirm). * Tinted windows (and/or curtains or blinds). * Luggage compartment (or bins) below in the underbelly of bus, with overhead hand- luggage racks. ==Tour coach manufacturers== * Motor Coach Industries * Volvo Buses ** Prevost Car * Mercedes-Benz buses ==See also== *Customised buses *Tourist trolley *Tour operator *Intercity bus service *List of buses ==References== Category:Types of bus service ","title":"Tour bus service"},{"id":"12362129","text":"The Hambling Baronetcy, of Yoxford in the County of Suffolk, is a title in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom.

It is sometimes called the logic of questions and answers. ==Overview== The idea was originally developed by Richard Whately. For example, he noted the ambiguity of the interrogation \\"Why?\\". (1) It could be a reason, such as why the angles of a triangle sum to two right angles, or (2) a cause, such as why days are shorter in winter than summer, or (3) a design requirement as in a timepiece.Richard Whately (1845), Elements of Rhetoric, page 58, via Internet ArchiveMary Prior and Arthur Prior \\"Erotetic Logic\\", The Philosophical Review 64(1) (1955): pp. 43‚Äì59 . In 1936 Whately's work was revived by Eugeniu Sperantia.Eugeniu Sperantia (1936) \\"Remarques sur les propositions interrogatives\\". Projet d'une \\"logique du probl√®me\\", Actes du Congr√®s International de Philosophie Scientifique, VII Logique, Paris,pp. 18‚Äì28. In 1955 Mary and Arthur Prior recalled Whately's suggestion for a variable copula to write questions symbolically. Recognizing the consequent symbolic calculus, they note that it is insufficient for the logic of interrogatives, which is antisymbolic. In 1940 R. G. Collingwood published An Essay on Metaphysics in which he examined presuppositions in statements and questions. In fact he claimed \\"Every statement that anybody ever makes is made in the answer to a question.\\" By way of explanation, he wrote \\"In proportion as a man is thinking scientifically when he makes a statement, he knows the statement is the answer to a question and he knows what the question is.\\" In this sense, when thinking is scientifically ordered, a question is logically prior to its own answer. Collingwood also asserts that \\"Each question involves a presupposition\\".R. G. Collingwood (1940) In 1966 Nuel D. Belnap, Jr. wrote on \\"Questions, Answers, and Presuppositions\\".Nuel D. Belnap, Jr. (1966) \\"Questions, Answers, and Presuppositions\\", The Journal of Philosophy 63(20): 609‚Äì11, American Philosophical Association Eastern Division Sixty-Third Annual Meeting. In 1963 MIT Press published Communication: a Logical Model by David Harrah that focused on questions as pivotal in communication.

The bibliography included 25 references on question answering and natural language understanding. For most of the time, researchers concentrated on the relation between questions and answers. Recently, more attention is given to the way questions come from sentences or other questions, similar to entailmentJoke Meheus (2001) \\"Adaptive logics for question evocation\\", Logique et Analyse, pages 135‚Äì164 Jstor link. Some contributions in this direction are Jaakko Hintikka's interrogative model and Andrzej Wi≈õniewski's inferential erotetic logic (IEL). In the interrogative model, questioning is seen as game played between two parties. One of these parties may be reality. In 2011 Anna Bro≈ºek published The Theory of Questions which started with philosophical context (ontology, epistemology), then use in human intercourse, with a consideration of cognition and answers. Embedded questions and situational analysis are noted, as well as specific considerations with regard to science, psychology, and surveys.

The screenplay was written by Slavko Janevski and is based on the 1900 play of the same name by playwright Vojdan Chernodrinski. The film was released through the production company Vardar Film. It tells the story of a young Macedonian woman Cveta who is kidnapped by a Turkish bey in North Macedonia under the rule of the Ottoman Empire. It follows her resistance to converting to Islam and renouncing her national identity along with the uprising of the locals against the Ottomans. ==Synopsis== The movie is based in Ottoman Vardar Macedonia and tells the story of a young woman named Cveta who is kidnapped by an Ottoman Turk in hopes of eloping with her. The film shows Macedonian villagers working on the fields for one of the numerous beys in the region. The bey is trying to persecute a Turkish man and wants to punish him for his progressive ideas. One of the Macedonian villagers, Spase the shepherd, helps the man escape which subsequently brings the bey to the fields where the villagers do their work. Present among the working villagers is Cveta, who stands out from the crowd with her beauty. The bey kidnaps the girl and takes her to his saray along with the other women-wives who form part of his harem. At the saray, Cveta is pressured to change her religion, renounce her family and adopt the Ottoman culture and values and eventually become one of the Bey's many submissive wives. To lure her in, the bey promises her fortune and an easy life. When the other villagers find out about the bey's forceful acts against her will, they gather in front of his house led by a priest and Spase (Cveta's love interest), and they demand that she be freed. Since their attempt is not successful, they take the case to court. Diplomatic lawyers from Bitola get involved in the case and they rule that Cveta go back to her family. Once free again, she decides to marry Spase and they start preparing for their wedding in the fictional village Stradalovo. However, during the celebrations the bey comes together with his soldiers in an attempt to prevent the event. He faces Spase and tries to shoot him for stealing his wife. Cveta goes in front of Spase and the bullet kills her immediately. Furious and heartbroken, all the villagers rise against the Turks in a heated armed conflict with a lot of victims. Spase and the bey fight with each other, and the former kills the bey by hitting him with a rock on the head and running away to join the rebel band Komitadji to fight against the Ottoman rule in the region. The film ends with the villagers mourning and burying Cveta. ==CastBackground and production== Macedonian Blood Wedding is a film adaptation of the eponymous play by Voydan Chernodrinski first published and shown in theaters in Sofia, Bulgaria in 1900. This book marks one of the most important works in Macedonian literature. The film takes place in the second half of the 19th century, a period during which North Macedonia was still under the rule of the Ottoman Empire and local Slavic population was subjected to Islamization and oppression. It is set in the period of the empire being in a state of anarchy, during which the Turks widely terrorized the population. As such, both the original play and the film's main topic is the unbearable life of the Macedonian population. Macedonian Blood Wedding marked Popov's directorial debut. It was released through the production company Vardar Film which also released the first-ever Macedonian film Frosina (1952). Filming took place in several cities in then SR Macedonia including Bitola, Tetovo as well as the production company's studios in the country's capital Skopje. The film was shown in Ohrid in early June 1968. The music score for the film was written by Kiril Makedonski and was performed by the Slovenian filharmonia. ==Awards== Following the film's screening at the Croatian Pula Film Festival in 1968, Nikola Lazarevski received a Golden Arena for Best Production Design. The following year, the film received a Golden award with Lenin's face to honor its success in the Soviet Union. ==See also== *Macedonian Blood Wedding *List of Macedonian films *List of Yugoslavian films *Cinema of North Macedonia ==ReferencesExternal links== * Macedonia Blood Wedding at the Macedonian Cinema Information Center * Category:Macedonian films Category:Macedonian-language films Category:Yugoslav films Category:1967 films ","title":"Macedonian Blood Wedding (film)"},{"id":"12362198","text":"The Khangar rajput are an Indian clan.

In January 2009, it was incorporated into Puntland. ==Autonomy== Maakhir was a self-proclaimed state that represented the political will of the Warsangali Darod within federal Somalia. The Warsangali were one of the principal actors in the creation of the Puntland State as a successor to the Harti Sultanates after the collapse of the central government in Somalia in 1991. However, since the proclamation of an autonomous Puntland in 1998, most of Warsangali felt that they were sidelined while the Majeerteen clan assumed a hegemonic role in the state.The Formation of Maakhir State of Somalia Maakhir was brought back into the Puntland fold by General Abdullahi Ahmed Jama (\\"Ilkajir\\"), who contested the Puntland election. General Ilkajir became the de facto leader of Maakhir following the dissolution of the Maakhir administration . Maakhir State proclaimed autonomy at a 1 July 2007 ceremony in Badhan in response to overlapping claims of Somaliland and Puntland over the western Sanaag and western Bari, both of which have led to several gun battles over control of the territory between Somaliland and Puntland. Puntland and Somaliland have signed oil concessions in this part of Sanaag, without the consent of the local leadership. This contributed to the desire of the local Warsangali to administer their own affairs, and to resolve disputes with Mohamud Muse Hersi, the former President of Puntland.The rise of Maakhir State and the fall of Puntland . Maakhir's form of self-governance like that of Puntland rested on the bottom-up approach endorsed by the international community for a federal Somalia. This self- governing model, which mandates a decentralized local level of government within Somalia, was seen as a workable long-term political strategy in resolving inter-group disputes. Maakhir built institutions such as civil society, law enforcement, xeer (customary law), and Shariah-based district courts. It also established a local military and naval establishment that protects the region's marine and land resources and which provides safety and access to the flow and supply of humanitarian aid, the normal operation of international and local NGOs, as well as the implementation of programs of the United Nations Development Programme. Maakhir's other stated aim was to provide much-needed public services by opening up a treasury office in Badhan, to ensure governance structures for the safety and maintenance of Laasqoray Port, and the protection of private local enterprises whose operational management and ownership fall under the guidance of the private sector of Maakhir state.Laas Qorey Port Operation . A third objective was to manage the complex local conflicts by strengthening the already existing traditional mechanisms, which will be consolidated and run by the Department of Justice. Maakhir sought to structure consensus around peace, internal security, market stability, cooperation and unity of purpose with its neighbors; and build bridges of trust and social harmony across dividing political lines and between opposing interests and groupings. Neither Somaliland or Puntland have recognized the state. Despite rumored talks with Ali Mohammed Ghedi, the former Prime Minister of Somalia, the Transitional Federal Government of Somalia declined to comment on the status of Maakhir and regarded Puntland as the official authority of the region.Maakhir State of Somalia faces challenges and obstacles . Article in Markacadeey online on 23 August 2007. There were still efforts to reestablish the state on 2018. ==History== Maakhir State of Somalia was the descendant of the Sultanate of Mohamoud Ali Shire (Warsangali Sultanate) which is the oldest sultanate in Somalia with a rich history and heritage. The old capital of the Warsangali sultanate was Las Khorey. The Sultanate of Mohamoud Ali Shire was considered by colonial authorities as having largely hegemonic authority over the other Harti sultanates, and the Warsangali played a large role in 19th century administration of Italian and British Somaliland. As the 20th century began however, the British and Italians ended the independence of the semi-independent Sultanates, and the Harti Confederation was dissolved in the midst of Italian and British rule, ending the traditional role of the Warsangali. Sultan Mohamoud Ali Shireh was exiled to the Seychelles ‚Äì \\"the islands to which many prominent anti-colonial leaders used to be exiled\\".A Touching Glimpse of History and the Reunion of a Somali Royalty After independence, the Majeerteen emerged as the leaders of the Harti group following the USP's merger with SYL‚Äîactive political parties on the eve of Somali independence. The Warsangali have however maintained their preeminent position as the traditional leaders of the Harti. This has challenged Puntland's attempts to assert its authority in Sanaag and western Bari. Disputes with Puntland The disputes between Maakhir and Puntland had centered around ex-Puntland president Adde Musa's exploration deals with Range Resources, a mining and oil corporation registered in Australia and his refusal to recognize Maakhir's declaration of autonomy. Despite intensive gun battles at the border, Puntland state insisted that the territory was part of its sphere of influence. Moreover, Puntland continued to carry on business as usual, when such business was exactly what caused the Declaration of autonomy in the first place. Conflicts with Puntland over charcoal Maakhir banned charcoal production due to the desertification it causes to the fragile Somali environment. Puntland had ignored the ban and sent several expeditions into Maakhir, with Puntland militia protecting the charcoal traders. Clashes between Puntland militias escorting charcoal traders and Maakhir militias attempting to stop charcoal production had occurred numerous times since the ban, in Majiyohan, Wa'iye and Sarmaanyo.Gun battle between Puntland Supported Militia and Maakhiri Forces in Southern Sanaag Puntland maintained its public statement that it did not recognize Maakhir. The demand for charcoal from Arab states of the Persian Gulf, sometimes referred to as the \\"Black Gem\\" due to its profitability, has fueled the clashes. In order to contain the charcoal expeditions, most of which are heavily armed and backed by big business interests, the Maakhir authority created a volunteer patrol force, the \\"Environmental Protection Corps\\".Environmental Protection Corps in Maakhir State of Somalia Somaliland military incursions On 25‚Äì26 February 2008, a Somaliland-aligned, well armed force laid siege to Hadaftimo, causing a brief state of emergency before the force withdrew back to western Erigavo. Maakhir authority responded with a military buildup in the Maakhir-controlled part of Erigavo.The political development of Somaliland and its conflict with Puntland. Hostilities re-emerged on 9 July 2008, when Somaliland invaded and occupied Laas Qoray port for few hours, under the pretext of a rescue mission (German citizens were allegedly being held hostage in Laas Qoray by pirates).CIIDAMADA SOMALILAND OO DHAAWAC U GAYSTAY MID KA MID AH DADKA XUSUL DUUBKA UGU JIRA SII DAYNTA DADKA AFDUUBKA LOO HAYSTO.

President Jibril promised a new government by June 2008, but Warsangelis decided instead to rally behind the campaign to elect General Ilkajir as President of Puntland. By the swearing in of the new president of Puntland, Abdirahman Mohamud Farole, Maakhir had fully rejoined Puntland. The two branches of government in Maakhir (the Parliament and the Executive) were led by President Jibril Ali Salad, the president of Maakhir; and Eng.

At the age of 19, during the 1997‚Äì98 season, he moved to Germany to play for Karlsruher SC in the Bundesliga. By around halfway into the season he had made himself a regular starter through his playing skills as an attacking midfielder and forward. However he could not prevent the team being relegated into the 2. Bundesliga. In the 1998‚Äì99 season he confirmed his initial promise and was ever-present as a key member of the team. However they narrowly missed out on promotion back into the Bundesliga. Gui√©-Mien was then approached by Bundesliga side Eintracht Frankfurt and agreed to join them before the start of 1999‚Äì2000. Here too he quickly became central to the team's plans, but again, after survival in his first year, the club dropped into the second division the following season. Frankfurt failed to come straight back up in 2001‚Äì02, and after a very successful start to the following season, with his best goal tally before the winter break to date, Gui√©-Mien moved to promotion-challengers SC Freiburg. In the event both teams were promoted that season. His spell at Freiburg, lasting until the end of 2003‚Äì04, was disappointing. He made just 25 appearances, many as a substitute lasting only a few minutes. His next move was to 1. FC K√∂ln, just relegated from the Bundesliga. There he was again unable to play himself into the starting eleven, achieving only the status of a squad player, and sometimes found himself playing for the amateur side in the Regionalliga. After his move to Freiburg, his continuing skillful play stood in stark contrast to his inability to score goals. Up to the end of 2004‚Äì05 he failed to score in 50 consecutive league matches. His contract at K√∂ln ran until the end of the 2005‚Äì06 season. However, after the appointment of Hanspeter Latour as manager, the club decided to release him early, and put him up for free transfer immediately after the 2005‚Äì06 winter break training. In September 2006 Gui√©- Mien signed for Oberliga side FC Sachsen Leipzig, where he played for one season. In summer 2007 he was contracted to Rot-Weiss Essen in the Regionalliga and signed one year later on 5 June 2008 with SC Paderborn 07. He retired when his contract ran out at the end of the 2011‚Äì12 season. ==International career== Gui√©-Mien played 26 matches for the Congo national team. ==ReferencesExternal links== * * * Category:Living people Category:1977 births Category:Sportspeople from Brazzaville Category:Association football midfielders Category:Republic of the Congo footballers Category:Republic of the Congo expatriate footballers Category:Republic of the Congo international footballers Category:2000 African Cup of Nations players Category:Karlsruher SC players Category:Eintracht Frankfurt players Category:SC Freiburg players Category:1.

Souffel (the Souffel river) + Weyer (the pond) + S (of) + Heim (hamlet, village) Locally the name is shortened and the village is called Souffel. ==Geography== The village covers an area of 451 hectares (1114 acres), and is located 6 km (3¬æ miles) north of Strasbourg at an altitude of 140 metres (460 ft). Located in the plain of Alsace, between the massifs of the Vosges and the Black Forest, the plain is bisected by the Souffel river from which the village takes its name. This river rises in Kuttolsheim and joins the Ill river, a tributary of the Rhine, a little south of Wantzenau after flowing . ==History== Half-timbered houses In 1790, the formerly common pasture meadows were subdivided, and sections were given to Souffelweyersheim, Hoenheim, Bischheim, Adelshoffen and Schiltigheim. In 1792, Austria and Prussia began hostilities against France. From October to December 1793, engagements between the troops of the French Republic and the Austro-Prussian alliance centered on a front near Hoenheim ‚Äì Griesheim-sur-Souffel ‚Äì Dingsheim before the Austro- Prussian troops were pushed back out of Alsace in January 1794. After his disastrous Russian campaign, Napoleon Bonaparte managed with difficulty to return to France, but enemy forces in the Sixth Coalition followed. In January 1814, the French troops lost Strasbourg to Cossacks who cantoned in Hoenheim, Bischheim and Schiltigheim. Napoleon abdicated in favour of Louis XVIII, and was banished to the isle of Elba. Napoleon escaped from Elba and returned to France on 26 February 1815. In a campaign that lasted a Hundred Days he attempted to remain on the throne of France. Ten days after Napoleon's final defeat at the Battle of Waterloo, General Jean Rapp led the French forces against the Crown Prince of W√ºrttemberg in the Battle of La Suffel near Souffelweyersheim and Hoenheim. The day after the battle, the Crown Prince of W√ºrttemberg ordered the burning of the village of Souffelweyersheim. It took all of the nineteenth century to rebuild the village.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Eleventh Edition, \\"Waterloo Campaign\\" 1852 was the year of the inauguration of two new transportation routes near Souffelweyersheim: the Marne-Rhine Canal which connects Vitry-le-Fran√ßois to Strasbourg, and the railway line between Paris and Strasbourg. 350px On 19 July 1870, the Franco-Prussian War began. On 7 August, shortly after the battle of Froeschwiller-W≈ìrth, German troops arrived at Souffelweyersheim. The troops settled in Reichstett and began a siege of Strasbourg on 12 August, arranging with the local populace for supplies for the troops. On 27 September, Strasbourg, burnt by the continuous bombing, surrendered. The Treaty of Frankfurt, signed 10 May 1871, put an end to the war, but France yielded three of departments of Alsace-Moselle, keeping only Belfort. In 1906, newly expanded rail yards at Hausbergen were completed. This facility serves several communes in the Souffelweyersheim area. On 2 September 1939, the inhabitants of the communes in front of the Maginot line were evacuated to the valley of the Bruche River. On 3 September 1939, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and France declared war on Germany. On 9 September, the evacuated inhabitants embarked on a second journey to the South of France. They did not return to Alsace, which was occupied by the Germans from August 1940 until liberation on 23 November 1944 by the French 2nd Armoured Division of General Leclerc. In January 1945, a German offensive called Operation Nordwind forced a redeployment of the Allied troops in the north of Alsace. General Charles de Gaulle refused the American order to evacuate Strasbourg and the French troops pushed the Germans back but not before they reached Offendorf. Souffelweyersheim and its environs remained under the fire of the German batteries until April 1945. A law of 1966 created the Urban Community of Strasbourg and Souffelweyersheim was integrated into it. 1970 saw the completion of the construction of the motorway A34 Metz ‚Äì Strasbourg, later absorbed by the A4 motorway connecting Paris to Strasbourg, skirting the rail yard at Hausbergen.

The facade was divided into five bays: on the first two stories, the middle bay comprised a wide arch around the main entrance and marquee, and the other bays included one large window each, while stories three through five comprised all smaller windows, with four in the middle and two in each of the others. Inside, the building was carefully constructed to minimize structural interference and to maximize visibility: although the theater was built to hold an audience of 2,600, none of the seats came near to being placed behind structural members. Instead, the ceiling was supported by a set of arches and vaults, covered with elaborate plaster details; the result was an exceptionally high-quality acoustic structure, important in the days of vaudeville. The red carpet was laid out permanently in the foyer, and space was provided in the main part of the theater for an orchestra that was available to play for ever performance. In 1930, the theater demonstrated its technological sophistication by installing air conditioning. ==History== Designed by architect George Rapp of Chicago, the Palace was the last theater built in Cincinnati before movies gained the prominence that they now enjoy. Built by the Ohio Construction Company at a cost of half a million dollars, the theater originally showed primarily vaudeville acts, but by the time RKO Pictures purchased it in 1930, it had been renovated to facilitate the showing of movies. Nevertheless, its stage remained useful; among the many performers who appeared live on its stage during the RKO era were Doris Day, Bing Crosby, and Burns and Allen.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 1. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 645. During its heyday, the theater would feature one act after another throughout the day, going from noon until almost midnight.Singer, Allen J. Stepping Out in Cincinnati: Queen City Entertainment 1900-1960. Charleston: Arcadia, 2005. Into the 1970s, it was still featuring both movies and live performances;\\"Palace Theater Having Troubles In Cincinnati\\", The Blade 1978-12-21: 32. although a group of investors spent more than $1 million to renovate it in 1978 and 1979, attendance continued to drop, and the doors were permanently closed by 1980. The building was demolished in 1982, and a new skyscraper, the Cincinnati Commerce Center, was erected in its place in 1984. Since the destruction of the Palace Theater, Cincinnati has been without a downtown movie palace; comparable buildings survive in nearby cities such as Columbus (Ohio Theatre) and Indianapolis (Indiana Theatre), serving as the homes of their symphony orchestras,The Palace Theater (Cincinnati, Ohio), Cornell University Libraries, n.d.

In 1980, the Palace was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying because of its place in local history, but the designation was unable to prevent its replacement with a skyscraper. Even though the theater has been gone for more than thirty years, it officially remains on the Register. ==References== Category:Theatres completed in 1918 Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 1982 Category:Cinemas and movie theaters in Ohio Category:Demolished buildings and structures in Ohio Category:Demolished theatres in the United States Category:Former cinemas in the United States Category:Italianate architecture in Ohio Category:Movie palaces Category:National Register of Historic Places in Cincinnati Category:Theatres in Cincinnati Category:Vaudeville theaters Category:Theatres on the National Register of Historic Places in Ohio ","title":"Palace Theatre (Cincinnati, Ohio)"},{"id":"12362336","text":"Wendy Spero is an actress, comedian, and writer who has performed on NPR, Comedy Central, VH1, NBC, and the Food Network.

It is slightly more than long and flows through Roaring Creek Township, Locust Township, Catawissa Township, Cleveland Township, and Franklin Township in Columbia County and Mayberry Township in Montour County. The watershed of the creek has an area of . It has three named tributaries: South Branch Roaring Creek, Lick Run, and Mill Creek. The creek is not considered to be impaired and is not affected by coal mining. However, its watershed has been impacted by human land use. Claystones, conglomerates, sandstones, siltstones, and shales all occur within the watershed. The creek flows through a gorge in its lower reaches, along the border between Columbia County and Montour County. Most of the watershed of Roaring Creek is in Columbia County, but small areas are in Montour County, Northumberland County, and Schuylkill County. More than 40 percent of the watershed is forested and nearly 40 percent is agricultural land. State game lands and state forests are also in the watershed. A total of approximately 3,500 people inhabit the watershed, as of 2000. The creek's drainage basin is a High-Quality Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery upstream of Lick Run. Downstream of Lick Run, the main stem is a Trout Stocked Fishery and Migratory Fishery. A reach of the creek above Lick Run is designated as Class A Wild Trout Waters. 31 species of fish were observed at 20 sites in the watershed in 2003 and 2004. Roaring Creek was historically known as Popemetang, but it was known as Roaring Creek by the late 1700s. Settlers such as Quakers first arrived in the area in the 1770s. In the 19th century, various mills and furnaces were constructed on the creek and several bridges were constructed. Agriculture was also a major industry in the watershed in the early 20th century. More bridges were constructed across the creek in the 20th century. The Roaring Creek Valley Conservation Association formed in February 2006. Part of the creek is navigable by canoe. ==Course== Roaring Creek in springtime Roaring Creek begins on Catawissa Mountain in Roaring Creek Township, Columbia County. It flows west-southwest for a short distance before turning south for a few tenths of a mile. It then turns west for a few miles and flows off Catawissa Mountain before eventually crossing State Route 2003, passing Mill Grove, and entering Locust Township. The creek turns north- northwest for a few tenths of a mile and reenters Roaring Creek Township before turning west and reentering Locust Township. It then flows west- northwest for more than a mile and receives Mill Creek, its first named tributary, from the right, as well as receiving the tributary Lick Run from the left. The creek then turns northwest for more than a mile and enters Slabtown before turning west for several tenths of a mile and crossing Pennsylvania Route 42. After this, it turns northwest for several tenths of a mile before meandering west-southwest for a few miles, passing Queen City, Parrs Mill, and a lake known as Lake Glory. In this stretch, the creek leaves Locust Township and crosses the border between Catawissa Township and Cleveland Township three or four times before entering Franklin Township. Near Pennsyl's Mill, The creek then meanders northwest for a few miles, crossing Pennsylvania Route 487 and receiving South Branch Roaring Creek, its least named tributary, from the left. Upon reaching the Montour County line, the creek turns north for a few miles, flowing along the border between Franklin Township, Columbia County and Mayberry Township, Montour County. In this reach, it passes through a gorge with Sharp Ridge on the west. After a few miles, the creek leaves the gorge and crosses State Route 3012. A few tenths of a mile further downstream, it reaches its confluence with the Susquehanna River. Roaring Creek joins the Susquehanna River upriver of its mouth. Tributaries Roaring Creek has three named tributaries: South Branch Roaring Creek, Lick Run, and Mill Creek. South Branch Roaring Creek joins Roaring Creek upstream of its mouth. Its watershed has an area of . Lick Run joins Roaring Creek upstream of its mouth. Its watershed has an area of . Mill Creek joins Roaring Creek upstream of its mouth. Its watershed has an area of . ==Hydrology== The concentration of alkalinity in Roaring Creek upstream of Lick Run is 9 milligrams per liter. Many nearby watersheds have been rendered nearly devoid of aquatic life due to acid mine drainage caused by coal mining. However, Roaring Creek has not been affected by this, although it has been still impacted by human land use. Sedimentation, siltation, and agricultural impacts occur in the watershed. The only impaired stream in the watershed is a small unnamed tributary that is impaired by siltation. From a chemical standpoint, Roaring Creek is infertile. The specific conductance of Roraing Creek ranges from 11 micro-siemens per centimeter at site 2 to 127 micro- siemens per centimeter at site 4. In 2003 and 2004, the pH of the creek ranged from 7.0 to 7.2. In a later survey, it was found to be acidic at sites 1 and 2 (6.50 and 6.89, respectively), but alkaline at sites 3 and 4 (7.34 and 8.27, respectively). The concentration of alkalinity in the creek ranges from 5.1 milligrams per liter at site 1 to 32 milligrams per liter at site 2. The concentration of water hardness ranges from 28 milligrams per liter at river mile 4.04 to 44 milligrams per liter at river mile 8.54. The discharge of the creek is 12.2 liters per second at site 1, 243.5 liters per second at site 2, 216.7 liters per second at site 3, and 271.6 liters per second at site 4. The concentration of nitrogen in Roaring Creek ranges from 956.5 micrograms per liter at site 1 to 2343.1 micrograms per liter at site 2. The phosphorus concentration ranges from 12.6 micrograms per liter at site 1 to 28.6 micrograms per liter at site 2. ==Geography, geology, and climate== Roaring Creek near the lower end of its gorge The elevation near the mouth of Roaring Creek is above sea level. The elevation of the creek's source is between above sea level. From above sea level, the gradient of the creek is 57.1 feet per mile. From above sea level to its mouth, the gradient is 25.7 feet per mile. The topography at the headwaters of Roaring Creek is mountainous. However, much of the watershed is rough and hilly and the creek flows through a valley surrounded by broken hills. It flows through a narrow gorge for its last . The creek's channel is sinuous. There are cobbly and rocky rapids on some reaches of the creek. In the gorge, the creek flows past cliffs and over ledges and waterfalls. A set of wet limestone ledges known as the Roaring Creek Bluffs are located along the creek in Franklin Township and Montour County. Power lines also cross the creek in this reach. Some strainers occur on the creek upstream of State Route 3012. A ridge known as Sharp Ridge is located near the creek. Roaring Creek is located in the ridge and valley physiographic province. A dividing ridge separates the creek from the Susquehanna River. One reach of the creek is a mid-sized coldwater stream. Another reach is a large freestone stream. Roaring Creek flows through rock formations consisting of sandstone and shale. Rocks in the watershed include claystones, conglomerates, sandstones, siltstones, and shales from the Devonian and Mississippian. Outcroppings of calcareous beds, limestones, and marine fossils occur in the watershed as well. Some mineable coal is present in the watershed of South Branch Roaring Creek. The Genesee beds appear along the creek and are the lowest beds that are visible above the water line. To the east, they are covered by Chemung beds. A soil known as the Albrights Series is found along the creek. It is a reddish-brown soil that is slightly poorly or moderately well drained and is made from glaciated red shale and sandstone. Roaring Creek has a 100 year floodplain. The average annual rate of precipitation in the watershed of Roaring Creek ranges from . In July 2003 and June 2004, the water temperature of the creek was found to range from at river mile 10.98 to at river mile 6.02. The air temperature near the creek ranged from at river mile 8.54 to at river mile 6.02. ==Watershed== Roaring Creek in its upper reaches The watershed of Roaring Creek has an area of . The watershed occupies parts of Columbia County, Montour County, Northumberland County, and Schuylkill County. Most of the watershed is in Columbia County and smaller areas are in Montour County and Northumberland County. Only a very small area in its upper reaches is in Schuylkill County. The watershed is in the Lower North Branch Susquehanna drainage basin. The creek's mouth is in the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Danville. However, its source is in the quadrangle of Shumans. The creek also passes through the quadrangle of Catawissa. Other quadrangles that the watershed is in include Shamokin, Ashland, and Mount Carmel. The creek flows in a generally northwesterly direction and serves as the border between Montour County and Columbia County in its last . Roaring Creek is one of three major streams draining the southern part of Columbia County. More than 40 percent of the watershed of Roaring Creek is on forested land, including evergreen and deciduous forests, as well as mixed forests. A significant portion of the forested land in the watershed is a tract of land along South Branch Roaring Creek. This tract was acquired by the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources in 2003. A large tract of forested land on a ridge running from Moosic to the Susquehanna River passes through the watershed of Roaring Creek. State forest land occurs along the southern edge of the watershed and Pennsylvania State Game Lands (Pennsylvania State Game Lands Number 58) occur along the eastern edge. Nearly 40 percent of the watershed is on agricultural land. This land use occurs in the creek's valley, as does open space. Upstream of Lick Run, 13 percent of Roaring Creek is on public land that is open to access. The remaining 87 percent is on private land that is closed to access. The remaining reaches of the creek are entirely on private land, but open to access. As of 2000, approximately 3,500 people live in the watershed. In section 01, the population density of the watershed is 18 people per square kilometer as of 2000. In section 02, the population density is 22 people per square kilometer and in section 03, the population density is 16 people per square kilometer. In section 01 of the creek, 50 percent of its length is within 100 meters of a road, 89 percent is within 300 meters, and 91 percent is within 500 meters. In section 02, 28 percent is within 100 meters, 87 percent is within 300 meters, and 100 percent is within 500 meters. In section 03, 96 percent of its length is within 100 meters of a road, 98 percent is within 300 meters of one, and 100 percent is within 500 meters of one. The creek flows through a remote-seeming farm valley for a substantial part of its length. Major roads in or near the watershed include Pennsylvania Route 487, Pennsylvania Route 54, and Pennsylvania Route 42. Visual assessment of Roaring Creek was carried out by Roaring Creek Valley Conservation Association volunteers at four locations in October and November 2007. The scores ranged from 15.5 out of 28 (55 percent; the lowest value in the entire watershed) to 23 out of 28 (82 percent). ==History and etymology== Roaring Creek was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1185166. Roaring Creek was known to the Lenni Lenape as Popemetang, which means \\"Roaring Creek\\" in English. This name likely originates from the waterfalls and rapids on the creek's lower reaches. The creek was known as Popemetang until the late 1700s. However, several maps were referring to it as Roaring Creek as early as 1792. Its name appears as Roaring Creek in even the earliest survey warrants in the area. The Centre Turnpike was constructed in 1770 and provided access to the valley of Roaring Creek, roughly following the current course of Pennsylvania Route 487 and Pennsylvania Route 54. The Reading Road was later constructed in the watershed and ran in a southeasterly direction. Quakers were living in the valley of the creek by the 1770s and land on the creek was patented to Samuel Shakespeare in 1773. A number of settlers arrived in the valley from the Philadelphia area via the Reading Road. Soon after the end of the American Revolutionary War, farms were appearing along the creek's banks. The second- oldest mill in what is now Columbia County was built in a gorge on Roaring Creek, near its mouth, in the 1780s. This mill was known as the Cleaver Mill. A second mill, which was similar to the first, was later constructed at the site. John Hauch constructed a furnace on the creek in 1816. It was the first furnace in the area. The first iron furnace in Montour County was built near the creek's mouth in 1839 or 1840. The furnace was known as the Roaring Creek Anthracite Water Power Furnace. It was altered in 1854. In 1856, the furnace produced 2350 tons of iron from ore on Montour Ridge, despite low water. The only post office in Mayberry Township up to 1915 was built at the mouth of the creek in 1895. It was known as Howelsville, after W.B. Howell, its first postmaster. In the early 1900s, major industries in the watershed of Roaring Creek included agriculture. However, the creek was also used as water power for a small gristmill. During this time period, major communities in the watershed included Roaring Creek and Bear Gap. Their populations were 407 and 124, respectively. In the early 1900s, the only major industries in Franklin Township were gristmills on the creek on the border between it and Cleveland Township. There were historically proposals to use the creek as a water supply for Danville, transferring the water via pipes under the Susquehanna River. Andrew Trone once constructed a hotel on the creek. Many bridges have been constructed across Roaring Creek and a number of covered bridges can be seen from the creek. The first bridge over the creek was constructed in 1874 at Slabtown for a cost of $1500. It was replaced in 1913 for a cost of $5500. The Davis Covered Bridge was built northwest of Slabtown in 1875 and repaired in 1997. It is long and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Snyder Covered Bridge No. 17 was built over the creek southeast of Slabtown in 1876 and repaired in 2010. It is long and is also on the National Register of Historic Places. The two-span Esther Furnace Covered Bridge was built over the creek in Cleveland Township in 1905. It is long and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. A steel stringer/multi-beam or girder bridge carrying State Route 2012 was constructed over Roaring Creek in 1908 and repaired in 1996. It is long and is situated east of Mill Grove. A concrete tee beam bridge was built over the creek in 1940 north of Aristes. This bridge is long and carries Pennsylvania Route 42. A two-span steel stringer/multi-beam or girder bridge carrying State Route 3003 was constructed across the creek southwest of Catawissa in 1950 and repaired in 2011. This bridge is long. Two bridges of the same type (but with only one span) were constructed over the creek in Slabtown and Mill Grove in 1956, carrying Creek Road and State Route 2001. Their lengths are and ; the first was repaired in 2011. A prestressed box beam or girders bridge carrying Pennsylvania Route 42 over the creek was built in 1959 south of Catawissa. Its length is and it was repaired in 2010. A bridge of a similar type was built over the creek in 1964 for T314. It is long and is situated to the south of Catawissa. A prestressed stringer/multi-beam or girder bridge carrying State Route 3012 was built across the creek in 1966. It is west of Catawissa and is long. A prestressed box beam or girders bridge was built across the creek in 1974 south of Catawissa. It is long and carries Pennsylvania Route 487. A bridge of the same type, but carrying T468, was built over the creek in 1981. It is situated south of Mill Grove and has a length of . A steel stringer/multi-beam or girder bridge carrying Mill Road was built over the creek in 1985 and repaired in 2012. This bridge is long and is situated southeast of Slabtown. In 2003, Martin Friday assessed streams in the watershed of Roaring Creek at 37 locations, using the United States Environmental Protection Agency's rapid assessment protocol. In 2004, Robert Wnuk carried out fisheries surveys on every named stream in the watershed. The Roaring Creek Valley Conservation Association formed in February 2006 to conserve the natural and cultural resources of the Roaring Creek watershed. ==Biology== Upstream of the tributary Lick Run, the drainage basin of Roaring Creek is designated as a High-Quality Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. From Lick Run downstream to its mouth, the main stem of the creek is a Trout-Stocking Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. Wild trout naturally reproduce in the creek from its headwaters downstream to upstream of its mouth, a distance of . They also naturally reproduce throughout the entire length of every other named tributary of the creek. Roaring Creek is considered by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission to be Class A Wild Trout Waters for brown trout from its headwaters downstream to Lick Run, a distance of . In 2003 and 2004, 31 fish species were found at 20 sites in the watershed of Roaring Creek. Eastern blacknose dace are the most common fish species in the watershed and were observed at 85 percent of the sites. White suckers and brown trout occurred at 80 percent of the sites, longnose dace occurred at 70 percent of the sites, cutlips minnows occurred at 65 percent of the sites, and bluegills occurred at 60 percent of the sites. Fallfish, golden shiners, yellow bullheads, and American eels were all historically observed in the watershed, but were not found during the survey. However, redside dace, creek chubsuckers, green sunfish, and fathead minnows were observed in the watershed for the first time during the 2003/2004 survey. The most common game species was wild brown trout, although smaller numbers of brook trout were observed as well. Other game fish in the creek's drainage basin include rainbow trout. smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, and chain pickerel. The biomass of wild brown trout in section 02 of Roaring Creek was estimated in the early 2000s to be 9.53 kilograms per hectare. There were an estimated 42 brown trout of legal size per kilometer of stream. This equates to an estimated 815 brown trout between in length in that section. The trout in section 02 of the creek are up to approximately in length and some brown trout in the creek can reach lengths of up to . Waterfowl have been known to inhabit the watershed of Roaring Creek. Various macroinvertebrate taxa inhabit Roaring Creek. At one site, there is one abundant macroinvertebrate taxon, with 25 to 100 individuals being observed. At this site, there are five common taxa and five present taxa, with 10 to 25 and 3 to 9 individuals being observed, respectively. Eleven taxa are rare, with fewer than three individuals being observed. At another site, there are two abundant taxa, three common taxa, four present taxa, and eight rare taxa. At a third site on the creek, there are three abundant taxa, four common taxa, three present taxa, and seven rare taxa. Hardwood trees and hemlocks occur on the slopes of the valley of Roaring Creek. Hemlocks also occur in the creek's gorge. The canopy coverage at four sites on the creek ranges from 0 percent to 75 percent. The algal biomass of the creek ranges from 0.01 to 1.21 in terms of chlorophyll a per square centimeter. The Roaring Creek Bluffs are listed on the Columbia County Natural Areas Inventory. Jeweled shooting-star, which is threatened in Pennsylvania, occurs at this site. Other plant species in this area include hydrangea, fragile fern, maidenhair spleenwort, golden saxifrage. However, several weedy plants also grow in the area. ==Recreation== It is possible to canoe on of Roaring Creek, from Slabtown to the mouth during fast snowmelt or within three days of heavy rain. The difficulty rating of the creek ranges from 1 to 2+. Edward Gertler's book Keystone Canoeing describes the scenery as being \\"fair to good\\". The book describes the creek itself as being \\"a small and easy-to-overlook wet weather stream\\". There are two painted canoe gauges on the creek, one at Pennsylvania Route 42 and the other at Pennsylvania Route 487. Roaring Creek is one of the major fishing area in Columbia County. Knoebels Amusement Park is in the western part of the creek's watershed. In the 1990s, the creek was a candidate for Pennsylvania Scenic Rivers status. ==See also== *Little Roaring Creek, the next tributary of the Susquehanna River going downriver *Catawissa Creek, the next tributary of the Susquehanna River going upriver *List of rivers of Pennsylvania ==ReferencesExternal links== *Roaring Creek Valley Conservation Association Category:Rivers of Columbia County, Pennsylvania Category:Rivers of Montour County, Pennsylvania Category:Tributaries of the Susquehanna River Category:Rivers of Pennsylvania ","title":"Roaring Creek (Pennsylvania)"},{"id":"12362372","text":"The Park Flats are an apartment building in the Walnut Hills neighborhood of Cincinnati, Ohio, United States.

It received national exposure when it was the subject of a reality series that aired on TBS in late 2004 known as The Mansion. In reference to the original owners, the property is known locally as the \\"Schott Estate.\\" Its address is 5336 Cleves Warsaw Road, Cincinnati, Ohio. ==Architecture== Pine Meer was built for William Charles (Wm. C.) and Lucia Riedlin Schott.History of Southwest Ohio: The Miami Valleys, Volume III, on Family and Personal History (New York and West Palm Beach: Lewis Historical Publishing Company, 1965), page 363. The buildings were designed by the firm of Rendigs, Panzer and Martin, one of Cincinnati's leading architectural firms during the second quarter of the 20th century.Walter E. Langsam, Description of Pine Meer for the Delhi Historical Society, 2004. The main house \\"is a distinctive example of the Tudor Revival architecture embodying the architectural details associated with the style. It is characterized by its random ashlar stone and half timber stucco wall treatment, multi-paned and grouped window treatments, decorative sandstone trim, large wall dormers and gable ends, Tudor arch detail, polychromic slate roof and decorative chimney treatment.\\"Editorial Staff, Ohio Historic Places Dictionary, Vol. II, State History Publications, LLC, pg. 649.] A unique feature of the home is the front terrace onto which the primary rooms on the first floor open. The main entry doors, opposite the side fronting the pond and street, were set back through a rather low cabled porch to set itself apart from the nearby service entrance. (During the TBS show \\"The Mansion\\" this entrance was modified and brought forward by enclosing the porch area.) Situated behind the main house is a carriage house, which has similar rough- stone as the main house on the first floor, but includes yellow brick on the sides and rear. It is dramatized by a pair of acutely angled gables at the ends along with vivid half-timbered patters. This structure contained a four car garage adjacent to a visi-bowl gas pump on the ground level and a servants quarter on the upper level. The lower rear level served as a barn with stalls to house animals, facing what was formerly fenced pastureland, and equipment/workshop rooms. The interior architectural detail of the main house \\"further articulates the Tudor Revival style through the use of Tudor arched doorways and fireplaces, Tudor and Jacobethan ceiling detail and paneled wall treatments.\\" It originally had 13 rooms, and 4.5 bathrooms, including a \\"sunken\\" music room, which enlarged the ceiling heights, with a built-in organ that could play music scrolls. There was also a screened bedroom porch off the main bedroom. (But it was enclosed by a later owner.) The house also contained a large attic, adjacent to the former servants quarters, with shed-roof dormers as well as a basement with laundry room, card room and wine cellar. The driveway entrance is flanked by rough-stone gateposts topped by carved pineapples, which in turn are flanked by shorter stone piers connected by horizontal slate \\"rooflets\\" over curved arches with wrought-iron grills. There was a bench and brass plaque that said \\"Pine Meer\\" on the left gate post and a plaque that said Wm. C. Schott on the right gate post. The long driveway branches into a circle between the two buildings along with a drive extending to the back of the carriage house. ==Grounds & Landscaping== Originally a farmstead with over 100 acres, the property was developed into a \\"Gentleman's farm\\", reminiscent of English country houses. The pastures were primarily used for cattle, pigs and a horse, but there was some sharecropping with some of the acreage. The main house lies on a hill rising gently in front of a \\"u\\" shaped pond. It once had a small boat dock at one end, an island for swan nesting at the other end and a fountain lying below the surface in the center. The pond had an underwater spring, was stocked with largemouth bass, contained waterfowl and was designed with a decorative stone overspill that drained excess water under the frontage road. Most of the acreage was in fenced pastures, but the homestead was surrounded by a formal garden, a vegetable garden and a rose garden. The Schott's had a great appreciation for trees and plants. The grounds were professionally landscaped including a flower garden with a seated trellis, a quaint bridge over a stone laid creek-bed and a stone staircase off the music room's veranda that lead to the formal garden with a stone trimmed swimming pool and fountain. (The original pool and formal gardens were removed and replaced with a larger pool by a more recent owner.) Hundreds of trees were planted, consisting of over 50 varieties, including a long entry \\"allee\\" drive formed by tall oaks, a couple groves of pine trees and an apple orchard. Large concentrations of daffodils were planted in various sections of the estate that beautifully complemented the flowering trees in the spring. The tree selections, particularly maples and oaks, provided vivid red and yellow colors in fall, and the evergreens and hollies provided color in winter and year-round. Adjacent to the orchard were wooden beehives that helped pollinate the orchard trees and flowers on the estate and that produced honey. Dozens of bird houses were also placed in the trees. Rather than decorate a cut tree for Christmas, Wm. C. always purchased a live tree and over 30 such trees were planted on the grounds, with some becoming quite large. On a hill to the west of the main estate, each of the Schott's sons, William Riedlin Schott (Wm.R). and Louis Lueders Schott (Louis L.), built homes for their families. Wm. R. called his home Copper Beeches, because a couple of these beautiful trees were adjacent to his home. Shortly thereafter, in the early 1960s, the rural character of the area began to change with the development of residential subdivisions nearby. A local church and school adjacent to the estate, St. Antoninus, was expanding and wanted land for athletic fields. Wm. C. provided a pasture for that use and ultimately donated land to the noted parish, which has become known as William C. Schott Memorial Fields,https://plus.google.com/100906676381799891714/about?gl=us&hl;=en or simply as Schott Fields. ==Schott Family== The parents of William C. Schott (Will) and Lucia Riedlin Schott were enterprising German Americans with important brewery connections. Will was the youngest son of J. M. Schott, who was the founder of J. M. Schott & Sons Cooperage in Cincinnati, and Lucia was the youngest daughter of Wm. Riedlin Sr., the owner of Bavarian Brewing Company located in Covington, KY. By the turn of the 20th century, Bavarian was the largest brewery in its state and the large cooperage firm shipped to breweries in several states. After the death of J. M. Schott, his sons took over both J.M. Schott & Sons Cooperage and the Cincinnati Galvanizing Company. In 1920 the Schott brothers built a plant for the galvanizing firm in Cincinnati's Spring Grove industrial district and Will became the General Manager and a Director. Reopening the Bavarian Brewery by Lucia Riedlin's relatives shortly after prohibition was unsuccessful. However, Will and his brothers purchased the brewery out of bankruptcy in 1938 and expanded its operations. Will and his brothers became executives of both the Bavarian Brewery and the Cincinnati Galvanizing Co. for a couple of decades. By the 1950s, Will Schott's son's, William R. Schott and Louis L. Schott, were then living next to Pine Meer and had become President and Secretary/Treasurer of Bavarian's, respectfully. Louis L. also became an executive in the family's galvanizing firm in the 1960s. William C. Schott was a philanthropist providing funds for a local hospital wing and murals for Western Hills High School, besides donating land for Schott Fields. Lucia Schott predeceased her husband by nearly a decade, but Will lived at Pine Meer for over fifty-five years, passing away at his home in 1981 at the age of 97. ==Historic site== The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on November 30, 1982, qualifying because of its historically significant architecture; it is presently the only historic house recorded for Green Township. The youngest son, Louis L. Schott, was interested in preserving the main house and the original style of landscaping around the buildings. He was also involved in subdividing much of the original acreage into a residential subdivision and a couple condominium projects, which contained architectural covenants to help maintain the character of the original estate and the area. ==References== Category:Houses completed in 1924 Category:Tudor Revival architecture in Ohio Category:Houses in Hamilton County, Ohio Category:National Register of Historic Places in Hamilton County, Ohio Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Ohio ","title":"Pine Meer"},{"id":"12362450","text":"Ben Pitman House is a registered historic building in Cincinnati, Ohio, listed in the National Register on July 7, 1969.

It was invented by David A. Lyle and were used from the late 19th century to 1952, when they were replaced by rockets for throwing lines. ==History== Earlier line throwers date back to the early 1800s, with the Manby mortar was credited with saving lives as early as 1808.\\"Manby, George William\\", The New International Encyclop√¶dia, vo. 14, New York: Dodd, Mead and Company, 1917. A rocket-based system was also devised by British engineer Henry Trengrouse in 1808.Parl. Papers, 1825, xxi.361 Sumner Increase Kimball, the first and subsequently only superintendent of the United States Life- Saving Service, wanted to find a better line-throwing device. Kimball engaged the help of the United States Army Board of Ordnance and in 1877 they assigned David A. Lyle (1845‚Äì1937), a first lieutenant, who began research and testing that resulted in reliable efficient designs. Lyle developed 3 bronze, smooth- bore guns of different sizes and the gun became the USLSS standard line- throwing gun.Shanks, York, and Shanks, U.S. Life Saving Service, at pages 67‚Äì69\\"David Lyle and his Life Saving Gun\\", Springfield Armory National Historic Site Projectiles for the gun were made of cast iron with a wrought iron eye bolt screwed into the base as an attachment point for the shot line. The projectile for the gun was long and weighed . It was placed into the gun barrel so the eye bolt with the line attached was sticking out. After firing, the projectile rotated so that the eye bolt and line were trailing. The gun had a large recoil from firing. A standard charge of of gunpowder would knock the gun back . The maximum rescue charge of would send the gun flying back even further. The type of gunpowder used was also critical. It was a variation of black powder,uniform grain size, marketed as Hazard‚Äôs Life-Saving Service Powder and DuPont Life-Saving Powder. Shotline was also just as critical to the accurate operation of the Lyle gun. Hemp line was found to be too brittle. Braided linen was usable, but it was too heavy with sea water after it was fired and had to be dried out before firing again. The best line was waterproofed braided linen. It cut through the air best and provided improved range. New lines were too stiff and were difficult to properly flake (to wind in a pattern so the line could be shot without getting tangled), so a new line needed to be fired several times to make it more flexible for flaking. One of the critical drills of the USLSS crew was flaking the line. If the first shot failed to go over the stranded ship, the line would have to be hauled in, reflaked, and shot again. An efficient flaking crew could minimize the time required to get ready for the second shot. On average, a crewman with two assistants could flake of line in about 25 minutes. ==Operation== These line guns are used primarily for shore based rescue operations. The Lyle Gun was hauled to the shoreline usually by U.S.L.L.S. surfmen in specially made beach carts. The iron wheels that supported the cart had wide bands outside the wheel to keep it from sinking into soft sand. The Surfmen would set up and fire the Lyle gun, aiming over the stranded or wrecked vessel and then pull the line within reach of the victims. The line fired to the ship in distress was a messenger line that was in turn tied to a heavier line, the Tally Board (with instruction in English and French), and a Tail block designed to support the breeches buoy. Once the breeches buoy lines and the Crotch Pole (an A frame) assembled, the survivors could be removed from the vessel by hand hauling the breeches buoy lines. The Lyle Gun could shoot the projectile about , although in actual rescues the practical range was much less. Rescues at greater distances were to be accomplished by lifeboats. ==Manufacturers== There were about 30 companies who made line-throwing guns from the late 19th century to 1952. Famous names included American Manufacturing, Galbraith, General Ordnance, Naval Company, Sculler and Steward. Production of Lyle Guns ceased in 1952 in favor of line-throwing rockets or pneumatic launchers. ==Beach apparatus gear== Lyle gun, Shot line and flaking box The Lyle gun was just one component of the items carried on the beach cart; many other pieces of equipment were crucial to the proper execution of the beach-based rescue. The breeches buoy drill, as it was sometimes called, was practiced by the Keeper and all surfmen every Thursday at 2 pm as per the manual at all stations. Crews that couldn't perform the drill in adequate time faced dismissal from the service. It was the crew's responsibility to maintain each piece of equipment in ship-shape as the safety of the crew and the success of the rescues depended upon it. Other items on the beach apparatus equipment list included: * Shot line and flaking box: The shot line is tied to the projectile and is the first line to reach the shipwreck. This is the thinnest line used in the drill and is stored in a special pattern the flaking box. This special pattern allows it to pay out freely as the gun is fired. After the drill, the shot line is returned to the box by carefully laying it in the flaking pattern, ensuring that it is ready for the next use. * Heaving stick: The heaving stick was used in case the Lyle gun could not be deployed and substituted as a line throwing device. This was a most dangerous technique, as the surfmen would often have to wade deep into the surf in attempt to get a line aboard the ship. * Tally board: The tally board is used to deliver instructions to the vessel in peril. It is simply a board with printed instructions (English on one side and French on the other) telling the mariners how to aid the surfmen in their rescue efforts. The tally board is tied to the shot line by the keeper at the same time as the whip line and hauled aboard. * Whip line and block: The whip consists of two whip reels mounted on the beach cart, the whip line, and the whip block. Once the shot is fired across the wreck or wreck pole, the shore-side end of the shot line is tied to the tail block. At that point it is hoped that there is an able bodied seaman aboard the ship capable of hauling in the shot line and attaching the tail block high aboard the ship. Once it is determined that the line has been secured to the vessel, the whip will be used to haul items such as the hawser, breeches buoy and sometimes the life-cart back and forth between the beach and the wreck. This operates in the same manner as an old-fashioned clothes line with pulleys operates with the surfmen pulling on either the windward or leeward half of the whip from shore. * Hawser and traveling block: The hawser is the work horse of all the lines. It is a thick, strong rope made from manila with a traveling block attached. This block travels along the hawser and carries the breeches buoy back and forth from the vessel by means of the whip. * Breeches buoy: The breeches buoy essentially is a life ring sewn into a pair of short pants. It is used to transport the wreck victim from the ship to the beach. It is attached to the traveling block which rides along the hawser and pulled back and forth by the surfmen manning the whip line. * Fall: The fall is a block and tackle pulling device used to place tension on the hawser. The fall consists of an inner block and outer block and has a ratio of 4:1, giving five surfmen the pulling strength of twenty. The outer* block is painted blue to indicate that it faces seaward and the outer* block is painted white to indicate that this block faces shoreward and is attached to the sand anchor pendant. *One of these is Wrong, recheck ... * Strap: The strap is a rope tied to itself to form a loop and is used to attach the fall's outer block hooks to the hawser by means of a knot named a cat's paw . * Crotch pole: The crotch pole is used to keep the victims and equipment traveling along the hawser above the crashing surf. It consists of two boards approximately long fashioned together similar to a pair of scissors. Once tension is placed on the hawser by means of the surfman pulling on the fall the Keeper will give the command to raise the crotch pole in position. Now the hawser is high above the surf and is ready to transport equipment. * Sand anchor: The sand anchor is used to secure the shore-side of the fall to the beach. It consists of two wooden planks connected loosely together with an eye bolt with pendant attached. The pendant is used to attach the fall to the sand anchor. A narrow trench is dug in the fashion of a cross to a depth of approximately . The anchor is placed in it and buried with care given not to cover the pendant. * Pick, shovel, and bucket: The pick and shovel are used to dig the trench to place the sand anchor. The bucket is used to carry water to wet a section of the shot line and to flood the Lyle gun barrel in the event of a misfire. * Hawser cutter: The hawser cutter is used to cut the hawser near the ship after the last victim is rescued. The cutter rides along the hawser and is pulled back and forth by the surfmen pulling on the whip line. The blades are carefully angled so that the hawser cutter moves freely along the hawser when being pulled seaward, but slices the hawser in two when pulled toward the shore. * Beach cart: The beach cart is a most essential part of the beach apparatus. Without the cart, it would be impossible for the surfmen to transport the equipment to the site of the wreck. The cart is pulled by two surfmen, pushed by two and steered by two. The beach cart rides on two wheels and fully loaded can weigh nearly . It also is crucial that the cart is loaded in a specific order where the first item loaded is the last item unloaded. * Lyle gun: The Lyle gun was used to shoot the shot line. == See also == *Breeches buoy *Henry Trengrouse == References == * Shanks, York, and Shanks, The U.S. Life-Saving Service: Heroes, Rescue, and Architecture of the Early Coast Guard, Costa√±o Books, Petaluma CA 1996, * Category:Rescue equipment ","title":"Lyle gun"},{"id":"12362470","text":"Willi Jutzi (born September 2, 1913 in Saarpfaltz, Bavaria - July 1941, in V√§rmland, Sweden) was a German soldier during World War II stationed in Gardermoen in Nazi occupied Norway.

What happened next is a not clear. Almost a year after his escape, the decomposed remains of Jutzi's body were discovered in a river by two teenage boyshttp://www.tidsresan.se/WW_Jutzi.html just a couple of hundred meters from where he had escaped. In the late 1950s, an investigation was made by the reporter D.V. Andersson from Arvika. He thought it was unclear how Jutzi had died and his conclusion was that he had been shot by the Swedish police who had been escorting him. During the war, at least 15 German soldiers (that had fled Norway & been deported back by the Swedish authorities) were executed. No official explanation has ever been made, and even today the case is unsolved. Willi Jutzi was buried at Eda cemetery in V√§rmland on July 8, 1942. ==References== *V√§rmlandsarkivet *Andersson, D.

These schemata have been the subject of debate, including about the nature of ethnicity, how or whether it can be categorised, and the relationship between ethnicity, race, and nationality. ==National statistics== The ethnic group question used in the 2011 census in England. In Wales, \\"Welsh\\" and \\"English\\" were listed in the opposite order of the \\"White\\" column. The options in Scotland and Northern Ireland were slightly different to those in England and Wales. The ethnic group question used in the 2011 census in Scotland. History and debate The 1991 UK census was the first to include a question on ethnicity. Field trials had started in 1975 to establish whether a question could be devised that was acceptable to the public and would provide information on race or ethnicity that would be more reliable than questions about an individual's parents' birthplaces. A number of different questions and answer classifications were suggested and tested, culminating in the April 1989 census test. The question used in the later 1991 census was similar to that tested in 1989, and took the same format on the census forms in England, Wales and Scotland. However, the question was not asked in Northern Ireland. The tick-boxes used in 1991 were \\"White\\", \\"Black-Caribbean\\", \\"Black-African\\", \\"Black-Other (please describe)\\", \\"Indian\\", \\"Pakistani\\", \\"Bangladeshi\\", \\"Chinese\\" and \\"Any other ethnic group (please describe)\\". Sociologist Peter J. Aspinall has categorised what he regards as a number of \\"persistent problems with salient collective terminology\\". These problems are ambiguity in respect of the populations that are described by different labels, the invisibility of white minority groups in official classifications, the acceptability of the terms used to those that they describe, and whether the collectivities have any substantive meaning. A number of academics have pointed out that the ethnicity classification employed in the census and other official statistics in the UK since 1991 involve confusion between the concepts of ethnicity and race. David I. Kertzer and Dominique Arel argue that this is the case in many censuses, and that \\"the case of Britain is illuminative of the recurring failure to distinguish race from ethnicity\\". Aspinall notes that sustained academic attention has been focused on \\"how the censuses measure ethnicity, especially the use of dimensions that many claim have little to do with ethnicity, such as skin colour, race, and nationality\\". In 2007, Simpson and Bola Akinwale also studied the stability of individuals' responses to ethnic group questions between the 1991 and 2001 census. They concluded that the membership of the \\"White\\" category was stable, whereas 7‚Äì9 per cent of those in the \\"Asian\\" group and 23 per cent of both the \\"Caribbean\\" and the \\"African\\" group in 1991 had switched to another group by 2001. They suggested that conscious changes in affiliation explained little of this instability, whereas unreliability of the question was significant, partly due to the ambiguous nature of the categories used and partly due to imprecision in the imputation of missing values. It has also been argued that the wording of the ethnicity question in the 2001 census, \\"What is your ethnic group?\\", embodies \\"an essential being ethnic\\" as opposed to \\"a constructed belonging to an ethnicity\\". The latter would be reflected in a question such as \\"choose one box to best describe your ethnic group\\", which was subsequently added in the 2011 census. Sociologist Steven Vertovec argues that \\"much public discourse and service provision is still based on a limited set of Census categories\\", and that \\"these categories do not begin to convey the extent and modes of diversity existing within the population today\\". User consultation undertaken by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) for the purpose of planning the 2011 census in England and Wales found that most of the respondents from all ethnic groups that took part in the testing felt comfortable with the use of the terms \\"Black\\" and \\"White\\". However, some participants suggested that these colour terms were confusing and unacceptable, did not adequately describe an individual's ethnic group, did not reflect his or her true skin colour, and were stereotypical and outdated terms. The heading \\"Black or Black British\\", which was used in 2001, was changed to \\"Black/African/Caribbean/Black British\\" for the 2011 census. As with earlier censuses, individuals who did not identify as \\"Black\\", \\"White\\" or \\"Asian\\" could instead write in their own ethnic group under \\"Other ethnic group\\". Persons with multiple ancestries could indicate their respective ethnic backgrounds under a \\"Mixed or multiple ethnic groups\\" tick box and write-in area. Between 2004 and 2008, the General Register Office for Scotland (GOS) conducted official consultation, research and question testing for the purpose of planning the 2011 Scottish census, with key evidence informing the new classification drawn from similar workshops carried out by the Office for National Statistics, the Welsh Assembly Government (WAG), and the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA). The GOS found that \\"Black\\" was a polarising term for many focus group participants and interviewees. Some participants opposed the use of such terms, while others supported them. Opposition to the term \\"Black\\" was strongest among individuals originating from ethnic groups in Africa and the Caribbean, especially the former. The main reasons cited for this opposition were that racial terms like \\"Black\\" and \\"White\\" were invalid, socially constructed concepts not based on empirical reality; that skin colour was distinct from ethnicity; that the \\"Black\\" and \\"White\\" categories from the earlier 2001 census were inconsistent with the \\"Asian\\" categories, thereby resulting in an unfair, double standard; and that the positioning of the \\"White\\" category atop the \\"non-White\\" categories implied a racial hierarchy, with \\"White\\" at the top. To redress this, the GOS established new, separate \\"African, African Scottish or African British\\" and \\"Caribbean, Caribbean Scottish or Caribbean British\\" tick boxes for individuals from Africa and the Caribbean, respectively, who did not identify as \\"Black, Black Scottish or Black British\\". It found that most testing participants thereafter chose to tick \\"African\\" or \\"Caribbean\\" instead of \\"Black\\". In the write-in area, they also noted their own respective ethnic groups, with few opting to write-in \\"Black\\". Additionally, individuals who did not identify as \\"Black\\", \\"White\\" or \\"Asian\\" could write in their own ethnic group under \\"Other ethnic group\\". Persons with multiple ancestries could indicate their respective ethnic backgrounds under a \\"Mixed or multiple ethnic groups\\" write-in area. There were calls for the 2011 national census in England and Wales to include extra tick boxes so people could identify their ethnic group in category A as English, Welsh and Cornish. Fight goes on to include Cornish ethnicity and language in Census 2011 options The tick boxes at the time only included \\"British\\", Irish or any other. Some experts, community and special interest group respondents also pointed out that the 'Black African' category was too broad. They remarked that the category did not provide enough information on the considerable diversity that existed within the various populations currently classified under this heading. This concealed heterogeneity ultimately made the gathered data of limited use analytically. To remedy this, the Muslim Council of Britain proposed that this census category should be broken down instead into specific ethnic groups. The National Association of British Arabs (NABA) and other Arab organisations also lobbied for the inclusion of a separate \\"Arab\\" entry, which would include under-reported groups from the Arab world such as Syrians, Yemenis, Somalis and Maghrebis. NABA reasoned that \\"lack of recognition of Arabs as a separate ethnic group, and hence their exclusion, has serious consequences for the planning of services and monitoring of such problems as racial discrimination\\". The specimen 2011 Census questions were published in 2009 and included new \\"Gypsy or Irish Traveller\\" and \\"Arab\\" categories. The final version of the census form included tick-boxes for \\"Gypsy or Irish Traveller\\" under the \\"White\\" heading, and \\"Arab\\" under the \\"Other ethnic group\\" heading. However, in the ONS's testing in England and Wales prior to the census, no Kurdish, Iranian, Berber, Somali or Egyptian participants chose to identify as Arab. Discussing the inclusion of nationalities such as \\"British\\" and \\"Irish\\" in the ethnic group categories of the census, Nissa Finney and Ludi Simpson argue that \\"on purely technical grounds, this is a mistake, confirmed by enumerators reporting that some Asian respondents had ticked 'British', having seen it as the first box and wishing to confirm their British identity and nationality\\". Samira Shackle, writing in the New Statesman, argues that \\"the fact that hundreds of thousands choose to describe their own ethnicity as Welsh, Scottish, or Cornish shows that 'ethnic British' is a nebulous concept\\". Self-definition The ethnicity data used in UK national statistics relies on individuals' self-definition. The Office for National Statistics explain this as follows: This self-defined categorisation was also used for classifying ethnicity in the 2001 UK Census. Slightly different categories were employed in Scotland and Northern Ireland, as compared with England and Wales, \\"to reflect local differences in the requirement for information\\". However, the data collected still allow for comparison across the UK. Different classifications were used in the 1991 Census, which was the first to include a question on ethnicity. Ethnicity categories The following are the options the ONS currently recommends for ethnicity surveys: {  style=\\"border: 1px solid darkgray;\\" ! align=\\"center\\"  England and Wales ! align=\\"center\\"  Northern Ireland ! align=\\"center\\"  Scotland - ! colspan=3 White -  English/Welsh/Scottish/Northern Irish/British   Scottish -  colspan=\\"2\\"   Other British -  Irish -  Gypsy or Irish traveller  Irish Traveller  Gypsy or Irish Traveller -  colspan=\\"2\\"   Polish -  Any other White background, please describe   Any other White ethnic group, please describe - ! colspan=\\"2\\"  Mixed / multiple ethnic groups  Mixed or Multiple ethnic groups -  colspan=\\"2\\"  White and Black Caribbean  -  colspan=\\"2\\"  White and Black African  -  colspan=\\"2\\"  Any other Mixed / Multiple ethnic background, please describe  Any Mixed or Multiple ethnic groups, please describe - ! colspan=\\"2\\"  Asian / Asian British  Asian, Asian Scottish or Asian British -  colspan=\\"2\\"  Indian  Indian, Indian Scottish or Indian British -  colspan=\\"2\\"  Pakistani  Pakistani, Pakistani Scottish or Pakistani British -  colspan=\\"2\\"  Bangladeshi  Bangladeshi, Bangladeshi Scottish or Bangladeshi British -  colspan=\\"2\\"  Chinese  Chinese, Chinese Scottish or Chinese British -  colspan=\\"3\\"  Any other Asian, please describe - ! colspan=\\"2\\"  Black / African / Caribbean / Black British  -  colspan=\\"2\\"  African  African -  colspan=\\"2\\"   African, African Scottish or African British -  colspan=\\"2\\"   Any other African, please describe -  colspan=\\"2\\"  Caribbean  Caribbean or Black -  colspan=\\"2\\"   Caribbean, Caribbean Scottish or Caribbean British -  colspan=\\"2\\"   Black, Black Scottish or Black British -  colspan=\\"2\\"  Any other Black / African / Caribbean background, please describe  Any other Caribbean or Black, please describe - ! colspan=\\"3\\"  Other ethnic group -  colspan=\\"2\\"  Arab  Arab, Arab Scottish or Arab British -  colspan=\\"3\\"  Any other ethnic group, please describe } In addition to the above \\"tick-box\\" options, respondents can also make use of the \\"please describe\\" options, also known as \\"write-in\\" answers. To do this, they would have to select one of the \\"any other\\" tick- boxes on the census form and write in their answer in the box provided. ==Police== {  style=\\"border: 1px solid darkgray;\\" style=\\"float:right;\\" !Code  Ethnicity -  IC1  White - North European -  IC2  White - South European -  IC3  Black -  IC4  Asian -  IC5  Chinese, Japanese, or other South East Asian -  IC6  Arabic or North African -  IC9  Unknown } The police services of the UK began to classify arrests in racial groups in 1975, but later replaced the race code with an Identity Code (IC) system. One of the recommendations of the Stephen Lawrence Inquiry was that people stopped and searched by the police should have their self-defined ethnic identity recorded. In March 2002, the Association of Chief Police Officers proposed a new system for self-definition, based on the 2001 census. From 1 April 2003, police forces were required to use this new system. Police forces and civil and emergency services, the NHS and local authorities in England and Wales may refer to this as the \\"6+1\\" system, named after the 6 classifications of ethnicity plus one category for \\"not stated\\". The IC classification is still used for descriptions of suspects by police officers amongst themselves, but does risk incorrectly identifying a victim, a witness or a suspect compared to that person's own description of their ethnicity. When a person is stopped by a police officer exercising statutory powers and asked to provide information under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act, they are asked to select one of the five main categories representing broad ethnic groups and then a more specific cultural background from within this group. Officers must record the respondent's answer, not their own opinion. The \\"6+1\\" IC code system remains widely used, when the police are unable to stop a suspect and ask them to give their self-defined ethnicity. {  style=\\"border: 1px solid darkgray;\\" !Code  Ethnicity -   Asian or Asian British -  A1  Indian -  A2  Pakistani -  A3  Bangladeshi -  A9  Any other Asian background -   Black or Black British -  B1  Caribbean -  B2  African -  B9  Any other Black background -   Mixed -  M1  White and Black Caribbean -  M2  White and Black African -  M3  White and Asian -  M9  Any other mixed background -   Chinese or any other ethnic group -  O1  Chinese -  O9  Any other ethnic group -   White -  W1  British -  W2  Irish -  W9  Any other White background -   +1 codes -  N1  The officer's presence is urgently required elsewhere -  N2  The situation involves public disorder -  N3  The person did not understand what is required -  N4  The person declined to define their ethnicity } ==Schools== The Department for Education's annual school census collects data on pupils in nurseries, primary, middle, secondary and special schools. This includes ethnicity data for pupils who are aged 5 or over at the beginning of the school year in August. The guidance notes on data collection note that ethnicity is a personal, subjective awareness, and that pupils and their parents can refuse to answer the ethnicity question. The codes used are based on the categories used in the 2001 UK census, with added \\"Travellers of Irish heritage\\", \\"Gypsy/Roma heritage\\" and \\"Sri Lankan Other\\" categories. If these codes are judged to not meet local needs, local authorities may use a Department for Education approved list of extended categories. The National Pupil Database attempts to match pupils' educational attainment to their characteristics gathered in the school census, including ethnicity. However, according to HM Inspectorate for Education and Training in Wales, the database contains data inaccuracies. A few of the local authorities and schools had also never accessed the repository, and some of these institutions were unaware of its existence. The NPD was also used least by the majority of local authorities and schools, with 65 percent deeming this method of educational data analysis to be of limited use, about 23 percent considering it to be fairly useful, and only around 11 percent regarding it as being very useful. Most schools and local authorities instead used the Welsh Assembly Government's national free school meal (FSM) benchmark data, which ranks a school's performance relative to other groups of schools with comparable free school meal levels. Around 55 percent of schools and local authorities deemed the benchmark data very useful, 35 percent considered it fairly useful, and only about 10 percent regarded it as being of limited use. Additionally, researchers conducting analysis for the London Borough of Lambeth have argued that broad ethnic groupings such as \\"black African\\" or \\"white other\\" can hide significant variation in educational performance, so they instead recommend the use of language categories. ==Healthcare== The ethnic group categories used in the National Health Service in England are based on the 2001 census. It has been argued that this causes problems, as other agencies such as social services use the newer 2011 census categories. In Scotland, the 2011 Scottish census categories are now used. In 2011, Scotland started to record ethnicity on death certificates, becoming the first country in the world to do so. Ethnicity data is not routinely recorded on birth certificates in any part of the UK. Whether the official UK ethnic group classifications are useful for research on health is the subject of debate. Peter Aspinall argues that the 2001 census categories fail to adequately break down the \\"white\\" group and ignore ethno-religious differences between South Asian groups, amongst other issues. Writing in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, Charles Agyemang, Raj Bhopal and Marc Bruijnzeels argue that: \\"The current groupings of African descent populations in the USA and the UK such as Black, Black African, and African American hide the huge heterogeneity within these groups, which weakens the value of ethnic categorisation as a means of providing culturally appropriate health care, and in understanding the causes of ethnic differences in disease. Such broad terms may not fit with self definition of ethnicity\\". ==Collective terms for minority ethnic groups== A number of terms have been used, by government and more generally, to refer to the collective ethnic minority population. These include \\"black and minority ethnic\\" (BME), \\"black, Asian and minority ethnic\\" (BAME) and \\"black and ethnic minority\\" (BEM). These terms have been criticised on a number of grounds, including for excluding national minorities such as the Cornish, Welsh, Scottish and Northern Irish from the definition of ethnic minorities, for suggesting that black people (and Asian people, specifically the South Asians with BAME) are racially separate from the ethnic minority population, and for including under a single label heterogenous groups with little in common with each other. ==See also== *Demographics of the United Kingdom ==NotesExternal links== * Ethnic group classification at ONS (PDF) * Measuring Equality: A guide for the collection and classification of ethnic group, national identity and religion data in the UK, Office for National Statistics, 2011 * Category:Office for National Statistics Ethnicity in the United Kingdom, Classification ","title":"Classification of ethnicity in the United Kingdom"},{"id":"12362478","text":"Joe Meli (born March 20, 1956 in Lethbridge, Alberta) is a retired judoka from Canada, who represented his native country at three Summer Olympics: 1976, 1984 and 1988.

Constructed in the 1890s to serve both regular police and the city's patrol service, it was named a historic site in the late twentieth century, but historic designation was unable to save it from destruction. ==History== Other than Chicago, which formed a patrol service in 1877, Cincinnati was the first city in the United States to establish a horse-mounted patrol service to provide general emergency services. When the first patrol force was formed at the end of 1881, its officers rode in horse-drawn carts that carried medical equipment such as surgical tools and stretchers in addition to police paraphernalia. Besides their responsibilities of supporting the regular police force, patrol officers watched for fires, and horse-mounted patrols provided police service in sparsely-populated parts of the city in which foot patrols were inconvenient. Their services were essential during emergencies, such as the chaos of early 1884: patrol officers rescued those endangered by dangerous Ohio River flooding and sought to maintain order during the courthouse riots. Horse- powered patrols were replaced by patrol cars and motorcycles in the 1910s and 1920s. Originally an English immigrant working lowly jobs for established architects, Hannaford raised himself into public prominence by producing such grand buildings as Music Hall, and the built environments of Cincinnati's wealthier neighborhoods were filled with Hannaford-designed buildings by the end of the nineteenth century.Gordon, Stephen C., and Elisabeth H.

During the twentieth century, the station saw a conversion from simple patrol usage into being the precinct headquarters for the city's fifth police district. It remained in official use until 1957, when a replacement police station opened on Ludlow Avenue, but it remained in city ownership. A contracting firm bought the building from the city in late 1980.City of Cincinnati Ordinance 205-1998. City officials hoped to see its preservation and redevelopment, but the new owners sold it in 1984 to another company that demolished the building and replaced it with a parking lot.Udris, Andi. \\"Release of Purchase Agreement: 1023-1026 York Street\\".

Components such as brick corbeling and ashlar stonework laid in belt courses contributed to the appearance of its symmetrical design. Despite stylistic differences, Police Station Five closely resembles Police Stations Two and Three, neoclassical structures downtown and on the city's west side: all three were built with similar massing and with symmetrical two-story structures, and covered with flat roofs. Contributing to the design similarities were practical necessities: when built, all three housed both police and patrol, and the form of Police Station Five was dictated by its placement in a neighborhood of rowhouses with deep lots of narrow width; its horse-mounted patrol could only access their section of the building via side and rear doors facing alleyways. ==Historic site== In early 1973, of land in Cincinnati's West End was designated the Dayton Street Historic District and listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The missile can be launched from multiple platforms and is capable of carrying conventional and nuclear warheads. It is currently deployed in limited numbers in LAC during standoff with China. ==Design== Nirbhay missiles mounted on a truck-based launcher Nirbhay is powered by a solid rocket booster for take off which is developed by Advanced Systems Laboratory (ASL). Upon reaching the required velocity and height, a Turbofan engine in the missile takes over for further propulsion. The missile is guided by an inertial navigation system developed by Research Centre Imarat (RCI) and a radio altimeter for the height determination. The missile has a Ring Laser Gyroscope (RLG) based guidance, control and navigation system. It also has a Microelectromechanical system (MEMS) based Inertial Navigation System (INS) along with the GPS/NAVIC system. The missile has a length of 6 metres, width of 0.52 metres, a wing span of 2.7 metres and weighs about 1500 kg. It has a range of about 1000 km and is capable of delivering 24 different types of warheads depending on mission requirements between 200 and 300 kg. The missile is claimed to have sea-skimming and loitering capability, i.e., it can go round a target and perform several manoeuvres and then re-engage it. It is also able to pick out a target and attack it among multiple targets. With two side wings, the missile is capable of flying at different altitudes ranging from 100 m to 4 km above the ground and can also fly at low altitudes (like low tree level) to avoid detection by enemy radar. It will eventually supplement the role played by Brahmos missile for the Indian Armed Forced by delivering warheads farther than the 450 km range of Brahmos. ==Development and trials== After the design was finalized, the technology required for the missile was developed. It was integrated by Research and Development Establishment (Engineers), a specialized arm of DRDO. Tata Motors Limited has built the vehicle that is the carrier/launcher for the Nirbhay system and is based on a \\"high mobility, all-terrain and all-wheel drive Tata LPTA 5252-12 X12 vehicle\\", developed in partnership with DRDO.

Saraswat, Director General & Scientific Adviser of DRDO, later said that the missile would be tested in February 2013. He said the delay was due to development of some processes. DRDO expected the missile to be ready for induction within 12 to 18 months after the February test. There were unconfirmed media reports that the missile would be scrapped due to multiple test failures but it was then reported that the project has been given an 18-month extension, till June 2018, to fix all outstanding issues.India Extends Homemade Missile Program Despite Failed TestParrikar gives lifeline to Nirbhay missile team, project gets extension till June 201India's Nirbhay cruise missile program extended by 18 months, says report Nirbhay project is now technically closed after completing six developmental trials. The next phase of tests will happen from April 2020 under a new name called Indigenous Technology Cruise Missile (ITCM). It will include Short Turbo Fan Engine (STFE) developed by Gas Turbine Research Establishment (GTRE) and a Radio- frequency (RF) seeker from Research Centre Imarat (RCI). A separate air- launched variant and submarine-launched variant is under active development.  First Trial  The surface version of Nirbhay missile was test fired for the first time on 12 March 2013 from the Integrated Test Range at Chandipur in Balasore district of Odisha. The missile in its maiden flight was supposed to hit a static target situated 1000 km away in the Bay of Bengal. Missile took off from the launch pad successfully and reached the second stage of propulsion, travelling 15 minutes through its envisaged path at a speed of 0.7 mach. After that it veered away from its trajectory forcing the command centre to detach the engine from the missile mid way into the flight. This was done to avoid the risk of the missile hitting the coastal areas. The missile was purposely destroyed in mid-flight. The test was a partial success as the missile took off, reached the second stage of propulsion, and travelled 30% of its range and completed most of the mission objectives, before deviating from its path. DRDO has detected the problem which was a faulty inertial navigation system and corrected the same in subsequent tests. Second Trial left A second launch of the Nirbhay missile was scheduled for February‚ÄìMay 2014 but it was further delayed until October 2014. Slight delay in October was also due to cyclone Hudhud. On 17 October 2014, the surface version of the missile was tested once again from the Integrated Test Range at Chandipur in Balasore district of Odisha, and this time the test was successful. The missile test met all the parameters & completed all 15 way-points. The missile travelled for more than 1000 km that lasted for a duration of over 1 hour and 10 minutes. The missile was tracked with the help of ground-based radars and its health parameters were monitored by telemetry stations from DRDO's ITR and LRDE (Electronics & Radar Development Establishment). Indian Air force fighter jet Jaguar chased the missile during its flight to capture the video of the flight. Third trial alt= The third test of the missile took place on 16 October 2015. The missile was to be tested for its low flying capability. The missile in flight was supposed to be brought down from 4800 meters to 20 meters gradually and in stages. Su-30 MKI aircraft videotaped the flight.Nirbhay missile set for critical low-altitude trial; Sukhoi to chase A press release by the Ministry of Defence stated the missile was launched at 11:38 IST and all initial critical operations such as Booster ignition, Booster separation, Wing deployment and engine start were successfully executed and Nirbhay reached the desired Cruise Altitude. Although the take off was successful after repeated disruptions of countdown, the missile crashed into the Bay of Bengal 11 minutes into its flight after covering only 128 km of its 1000 km range.Chandipur, Odisha on March 12, 2013.alt=left  Fourth Trial  The fourth test of the missile took place on 21 December 2016 from Launch Complex-III of Integrated Test Range (ITR) at Balasore in Odisha around 11:56 IST. There has been no official word on the test outcome, however according to news reports this test was not successful. The booster engine in the first stage started working and lifted the missile off from its launcher. But the missile started veering dangerously towards one side in two minutes after lift-off and veered outside its safety corridor. Due to this, the test was aborted and the missile was remotely destroyed. A potential reason for the failure was described as a hardware problem with one of the missile's component.  Fifth Trial  The fifth successful test of the missile took place on 7 November 2017 from Launch Complex-III of Integrated Test Range (ITR) at Balasore in Odisha around 11:20 IST. The flight test was a success and met all mission objectives. During the test, the missile travelled a distance of 647 km over a 50 min duration was tracked by ground based radars and telemetry stations.https://www.defencenewsindia.com/fifth-test-of-indias- nirbhay-nuclear-capable-cruise-missile-declared-a-success/ This trial of the missile used a turbojet engine instead of a turbofan engine  Sixth Trial  Sixth missile trial from Integrated Test Range, Odisha on 15 April 2019. The sixth successful trial took place on April 15, 2019. Traversing around 650 km, the test missile navigated way-points located at altitudes varying from 5 meters to 2.5 km. DRDO clarified that all mission objectives were met. The test also validated the terrain hugging and the sea skimming capability of the missile. This trial completed the developmental trials of the missile. The next set of trials will be conducted as per the requirements of the user - the Indian Armed Forces.  Seventh Trial  DRDO is planning to conduct test of Nirbhay under the new name Indigenous Technology Cruise Missile (ITCM) with GTRE developed Short Turbo Fan Engine (STFE) called Manik and an upgraded RF seeker from RCI on 12 October 2020. The seventh trial took place on October 12, 2020 at 10:30 AM from Wheeler Island, it was given a test-launch window of 2 days. The test was aborted after 8 minutes of launch and the missile ditched into open waters due to a technical glitch, which is yet to be ascertained. GTRE developed STFE is a crucial step in achieving self-sufficiency in cruise missile technology. DRDO is expected to fly the Nirbhay again in a few months after analyzing the data. ==Deployment== India has deployed its long-range missile Nirbhay along with missile Brahmos and Akash surface to air missile to deter Chinese aggression along the Line of Actual Control in eastern Ladakh . == Manik Engine == GTRE is developing a new 4.25 kN thrust turbofan engine to power Nirbhay Cruise missile and future UAV, Long range AshM cruise missile systems.

St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 653. ==Historic context== Good transportation is a leading reason for Wyoming's prosperity. The city lies near the old pre-statehood road that connected Cincinnati with locations farther north, such as Fort Hamilton and Fallen Timbers. Curves in the road were cut off in 1806, forming a new road that is today followed by Springfield Pike through central Wyoming. Improvements in the 1830s only enhanced its importance.McCauley, Jennifer. '. National Park Service, 1985-08-16. Accessed 2011-02-26. By this time, another mode of transportation had become significant: the Miami and Erie Canal was built a short distance to the east in 1828, and the village of Lockland grew up along its side. Railroads reached the city in 1851 with the construction of the Cincinnati, Hamilton, and Dayton Railroad on the border between Lockland and Wyoming. Because of Wyoming's proximity to the industry of Lockland, its easy transportation to the booming city of Cincinnati, and its pleasant scenery, many wealthy industrialists purchased local farms and built grand country houses. Most such houses were built in the Wyoming Hills area, west of Springfield Pike; growth in this area continued until the coming of the Great Depression. John C. Pollock was among the businessmen building these houses; he was one of the partners in a Cincinnati insurance firm, Pollock and Whittlesey. ==Historic site== In 1979, a local historic preservation group began a citywide survey to identify Wyoming's historic buildings, and this effort culminated with a multiple property submission of eighteen houses, the Wyoming Presbyterian Church, and one historic district to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Along with all but one of the other properties, the Pollock House was listed on the Register in the following year, qualifying because of its historically significant architecture. It is one of five Reily Road houses included in this group, along with the Charles Fay House, the Luethstrom-Hurin House, the Louis Sawyer House, and the William Stearns House. ==References== Category:Houses completed in 1870 Category:Houses in Wyoming, Ohio Category:National Register of Historic Places in Hamilton County, Ohio Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Ohio Category:Italianate architecture in Ohio ","title":"John C.

Constructed in the mid-19th century, it experienced a radical transformation near the end of the century under the direction of a leading regional architect. This French-style residence has been named a historic site. William Powell established a Cincinnati metalworking firm in 1846 under the name of \\"Powell Valve and Brassworks Company\\". Among his sons was Henry Powell, who became wealthy enough to finance the construction of a larger and more ornate house. This residence, the present house,Owen, Lorrie K., ed.

At the time of construction, Powell's home was a Greek Revival structure, greatly different in appearance from its present form. Its structure was profoundly modified in an extensive reconstruction of 1882, performed according to a design by leading Cincinnati architect Samuel Hannaford; by replacing the old roof with a mansard roof and adding a wooden porch, Hannaford destroyed the original Greek Revival styling and replaced it with the Second Empire exterior that remains today.Gordon, Stephen C., and Elisabeth H. Tuttle. '. National Park Service, 1978-12-11. The Powell House was reconstructed during Hannaford's longest period of independent practice: his reputation solidified by his design of Music Hall, Hannaford operated without partners from 1877 until 1887. During this time, he produced many buildings in various Victorian architectural styles. Today, the Powell House is a brick building with stone foundation and a slate roof, plus additional elements of brick and wood., Ohio History Connection, 2015. Accessed 2015-12-26. Three stories tall, the facade is divided into three bays, with the wooden porch extending across the entire width of the first story. More decorations are present on the porch than on any other sections of the exterior, due to components such as an exceptional balustrade and an unusually flat mansard roof featuring a cornice with dentils; the structure comprises similar sides that differ substantially from the central section. In 1973, much of Mount Auburn was designated the Mount Auburn Historic District and added to the National Register of Historic Places. The historic district embraced both sides of Auburn Avenue throughout the neighborhood, and the Powell House was considered important enough to the district's integrity that it was designated a contributing property. Although it was already part of the district, the house was added to the Register again in 1980, this time by itself; it was part of a group of dozens of buildings designed by Samuel Hannaford, nominated as a multiple property submission due to their place as examples of the work of the most important architect to practice in nineteenth-century Cincinnati. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Additional documentation from the University of Cincinnati Category:Houses completed in 1858 Category:Houses in Cincinnati Category:National Register of Historic Places in Cincinnati Category:Second Empire architecture in Ohio Category:Historic district contributing properties in Ohio Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Ohio Category:Buildings with mansard roofs ","title":"Henry Powell House"},{"id":"12362524","text":"The Probasco Fountain is a large fountain in Cincinnati, Ohio, United States.

The central part of the district is the Rennert Mound (also known as the \\"Minnie Rennert Mound\\"), which retains its original shape despite digging by locals in the past. Because the mound has never been excavated professionally, no significant artifacts have been recovered from it; consequently, the culture of the builders is unknown.

Built in 1867,Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 1. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 665-666. it was designed by James Keys Wilson and features a mix of the Romanesque Revival and Gothic Revival styles of architecture. Wilson designed Scarlet Oaks under commission from prominent businessman George K. Schoenberger, a Pittsburgh native who settled in Cincinnati with the intention of opening a subsidiary of his father's iron-manufacturing corporation. Here, he became prosperous; at one point, he was one of the \\"Seven Barons of Clifton\\", a popularly perceived group of business leaders in this wealthy city neighborhood. In 1883 Schoenberger married Ella Beatty, daughter of John Beatty, Esquire, M.D., Professor of Sciences in Victoria University, Cobourg, Ontario., and his wife, Eleanor Armstrong. Ella was born and educated in Cobourg, Ontario. After Schoenberger died in 1892, she remarried the composer Charles A. E. Harriss in 1897 and occupied \\"Earnscliffe,\\" a Victorian Manor house at Ottawa, Ontario. At the time of its construction, Scarlet Oaks was Cincinnati's largest house. The origin of its design is disputed: Cincinnati local tradition claims that it was modelled after a castle along the Rhine in Germany, while later architectural historians believe that no specific house was used as the pattern. Moreover, an 1870s guidebook rejected the idea of German ancestry entirely, seeing the house as an example of French Gothic Revival architecture. Outside of Cincinnati, Scarlet Oaks quickly became widely known. One of the first issues of The American Architect and Building News, published in 1876, devoted significant coverage to it, and architectural historians have seen its design as anticipating the styles of grand Gilded Age mansions such as multiple Vanderbilt houses designed by Richard Morris Hunt. Wilson designed many houses, but by the 1960s, many seem to have been destroyed; perhaps in part because of its widespread recognition, Scarlet Oaks was the only extant residence that was conclusively identified as being designed by him. Since that time, at least one other surviving Cincinnati residence has been identified as a Wilson design ‚Äî the John S. Baker House, built in 1854. Built of limestone,, Ohio Historical Society, 2007. Accessed 2011-02-25. Scarlet Oaks is a massive two-and-a-half-story house with many distinctive architectural features. From a distance, the house's appearance is dominated by its turret and other high towers, and the great size of the building makes it unique even among Clifton's other large residences. More than a century has passed since the house ceased to be a private residence: it was purchased by E.H. Huenefeld in 1910, who immediately donated it to local congregations of the Methodist Episcopal Church. Since that time, it has been used as a group facility: after originally being used as a sanitarium, it has since been converted into a retirement home. In 1973, Scarlet Oaks was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Despite the difficulty of being a religiously affiliated property, it qualified for inclusion because of its distinctive and historically significant architecture. To the present day, it remains a retirement home, although now affiliated with the Deaconess Hospital.Introduction to Scarlet Oaks, Scarlet Oaks, 2011.

Tuttle. '. National Park Service, 1978-12-11. During the late nineteenth century, he was responsible for designing many fine residences like the Scott House: many prominent businessmen and politicians of the Gilded Age found his designs highly appealing, and the wealthy neighborhoods of Clifton, Walnut Hills, and Avondale were dotted with grand Hannaford houses. It was this architect whom Scott chose to design his own residence in 1887. Scott's house features a mix of materials: the foundation is stone, the walls are brick, the roof is slate, and wooden elements are also prominent., Ohio Historical Society, 2007. Accessed 2013-12-14. Two and a half stories tall, the house combines generic Victorian styling with Queen Anne influences. Among its prominent components are the large gables formed by the rooflines, Eastlake-style details on the porch, and a turret on one corner. Half-timbering with stucco covers many of the front walls above and around the porch, which itself includes details such as a pediment and frieze, while the turret's exterior comprises numerous lintels and lugsills, and its roof is an eight-sided pyramid. In 1980, the George Scott House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying because of its architecture; it was deemed a fine example of the changing architectural tastes of the late 19th century, which Hannaford frequently embraced by designing numerous buildings in varying architectural styles.

Significant elements of the porch include the chamferred pillars, decorative molding, and arches with elaborate latticework. ==Historic context== Good transportation is a leading reason for Wyoming's prosperity. The city lies near the old pre- statehood road that connected Cincinnati with locations farther north, such as Fort Hamilton and Fallen Timbers. Curves in the road were cut off in 1806, forming a new road that is today followed by Springfield Pike through central Wyoming. Improvements in the 1830s only enhanced its importance.McCauley, Jennifer. '. National Park Service, 1985-08-16. Accessed 2011-02-26. By this time, another mode of transportation had become significant: the Miami and Erie Canal was built a short distance to the east in 1828, and the village of Lockland grew up along its side. Railroads reached the city in 1851 with the construction of the Cincinnati, Hamilton, and Dayton Railroad on the border between Lockland and Wyoming. Because of Wyoming's proximity to the industry of Lockland, its easy transportation to the booming city of Cincinnati, and its pleasant scenery, many wealthy industrialists purchased local farms and built grand country houses. Most such houses were built in the Wyoming Hills area, west of Springfield Pike; growth in this area continued until the coming of the Great Depression. As the owner of the Tangeman Paper Company in Lockland, John Tangeman was among the first industrialists to build a house in Wyoming. He resided on the property for more than thirty years, beginning at its completion in 1857 and continuing until 1891 at least. ==Historic site== In 1979, a local historic preservation group began a citywide survey to identify Wyoming's historic buildings, and this effort culminated with a multiple property submission of eighteen houses, the Wyoming Presbyterian Church, and one historic district to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Along with all but one of the other properties, the Tangeman House was listed on the Register in the following year, qualifying because of its historically significant architecture and because of its connection to Tangeman. ==References== Category:Houses completed in 1857 Category:Houses in Wyoming, Ohio Category:National Register of Historic Places in Hamilton County, Ohio Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Ohio Category:Italianate architecture in Ohio Category:1857 establishments in Ohio ","title":"John Tangeman House"},{"id":"12362878","text":"Peter G. Thomson House, commonly known as Laurel Court, is a registered historic building in Cincinnati, Ohio, listed in the National Register on November 29, 1979. Currently the house is a private residence that is available for tours by reservation for special events. ==Design and construction== Peter G. Thomson, founder of The Champion Coated Paper Co., began construction on Laurel Court in 1902. He selected James Gamble Rogers, the nephew of Peter's wife, Laura Gamble Thomson, to design the Gilded Age mansion. Although the design is sometimes mistakenly said to be based on the Petit Trianon, Rogers based the house's ordonnance and design system on the Trianon de Marbre, the Grand Trianon at Versailles, France, as can be seen from the duplication of the Grand Trianon's decorated Ionic order (the Petit Trianon is Corinthian), the governing concept of a colonnade between cubical pavilions, and the overall articulation of the structure. The house is of course smaller than the Grand Trianon, it is revetted in simple stone rather than the varicolored marbles of the French prototype, and it is of two stories rather than one and adapted otherwise to meet the requirements of a private residence of its time, but every design decision in the structure was governed by reference to the Grand Trianon, with no reference whatever to the much later Petit Trianon.

The project began when editors at the German and then Italian versions of Wikitravel decided in September 2006 to move their editing activities and then current content to a new site, in accordance with the site copyright license, a procedure known as \\"forking\\". The resulting site went live as \\"Wikivoyage\\" on December 10, 2006 and was owned and operated by a German association set up for that purpose, Wikivoyage e.V.

Retrieved January 16, 2013. the English-language version community of Wikitravel also decided as a community to fork their project. In a two-way move, the English Wikitravel community re-merged with Wikivoyage under the Wikivoyage brand, and also all Wikivoyage language versions moved their operations to be hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation, a non-profit organization hosting several of the world's largest wiki-based communities such as Wikipedia.The Case of Wikitravel and Wikivoyage Governance Across Borders, July 2012 Following agreements by the various communities involved and the Wikimedia Foundation, the site was moved to the WMF servers in December 2012 and the whole of Wikivoyage was officially re-launched as a Wikimedia project on January 15, 2013, the day of the 12th anniversary of Wikipedia's launch. ==Description== Using a wiki model, Wikivoyage is built through collaboration of Wikivoyagers from around the globe. Articles can cover different levels of geographic specificity, from continents to districts of a city. These are logically connected in a hierarchy, by specifying that the location covered in one article \\"is within\\" the larger location described by another. The project also includes articles on travel-related topics, phrasebooks for travelers, and suggested itineraries. Wikivoyage is a multilingual project available in languages, with each language-specific project developed independently. While now a Wikimedia project, it was begun independently. Wikivoyage content is broadly categorized as: destinations, itineraries, phrasebooks, and travel topics. Destinations Geographical units within the geographical hierarchy may be described in articles, based on the criterion, \\"can you sleep there?\\" The hierarchy includes: * Continents * Continental sections (like Southeast Asia) * Countries * Regions within countries (provinces, counties, states, groups of states etc.) * Cities of any size, including fairly small villages if they are tourist destinations * Districts within large cities * National parks provided they have accommodation for the traveller Attractions such as hotels, restaurants, bars, stores, nightclubs, tour operators, museums, statues or other works of art, city parks, town squares or streets, festivals or events, transport systems or stations, bodies of water, and uninhabited islands are listed in the article for the place within which they are located. Itineraries An itinerary describes a group of destinations according to a temporal division rather than a spatial one and will list destinations and attractions to visit during a given amount of time, with recommended durations of stay and routes to follow. Itineraries may cross geographical regions, but usually have a well-defined path. Phrasebooks A phrasebook includes: # An overview of the language, giving a brief history, scope (where it is spoken, how many speakers), alphabet or symbol set, and any other general info on the language. # A pronunciation guide, with a description of each written symbol in the language (that is, its alphabet), and a pronunciation note for each symbol. # A phrase list. Each entry in the phrase list includes the word or phrase being translated, the spelling in the local language symbol set as it would be seen written down, and a pronunciation cue. Travel topics Travel topics are articles that deal with a specific topic of interest to travelers that is too large or detailed to go in a specific travel guide destination page; travel tips that are so general that they apply to nearly all destinations and do not need to be in each specific travel guide; major events that occur in different places; and specialist travel information, such as regional guides to scuba-diving sites. ==Organization and operation== Mode of operation Wikivoyage uses the free MediaWiki software (developed for Wikipedia) to allow internet-based editing without requiring registration. Quality assurance occurs in the same way as on Wikipedia: through reciprocal control by editors. The use of the same software was intended to facilitate familiarization with Wikivoyage. Copyright Wikivoyage licenses its content to the public under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license, but not the GNU Free Documentation License. This is intended to facilitate the production of printed guides from a legal point of view. Media files are intended to be published either in the public domain or licensed under multiple licenses (GNU, Creative Commons). Information structure The information is built up in a more structured way than usual for encyclopaedias. Articles belonging to a topic are grouped by the categories known from the Mediawiki software as well as through the so-called bread crumb trails which show the geographical connection between the articles. In the German-language version, different name spaces are used to separate different topics. The main name space contains travel destinations within their geographical hierarchy. Two other important name spaces are reserved for travel topics and travel news, with the intent to allow a tight interconnection between travel destinations and topics. The content design is decided by consensus of the community of authors. Languages At the time of transfer to WMF, Wikivoyage was available in German, Italian, English, French, Dutch, Russian, and Swedish language versions. The Russian-language project is named –í–∏–∫–∏–≥–∏–¥ (which translates roughly as \\"wiki guide\\"). In January 2013, Portuguese and Spanish versions were created, followed in March by Polish and Romanian, in April by Hebrew and Ukrainian, in May by Greek, and the Vietnamese in August. The Chinese version started in January 2014 and Persian in October. The Finnish version launched in November 2016, Hindi in September 2017 and Bengali and Pashto in June 2018. A Japanese version began in August 2020. Statistics As of , there are wikivoyage sites for languages of which are active and are closed.Wikimedia's MediaWiki API:Siteinfo.

It was retained after extensive voting amongst established editors to decide on the post re- launch name. Launch Many Wikivoyage authors and administrators started by working on Wikitravel, which launched its German version on October 7, 2004. On April 20, 2006, Wikitravel was acquired by the for-profit Internet Brands, an operator of media and e-commerce sites. Discontent increased in response to the management style of the new owners, and this led to the decision by most German administrators and authors to continue the project as a fork. After about six months of preparation, the non-profit association Wikivoyage e.V. was founded and registered, as both the owner of the domain names and operator of the servers.See the bylaws of the Wikivoyage association. On December 10, 2006, the project went live online with the initial data from the German-language Wikitravel. After seven months, 40% of the articles were new, rising to 50% after 10 months. At this stage there were still major gaps in the coverage, but there were several articles for travel destinations like Egypt, Thailand and Switzerland and for the travel topic \\"cycling\\".The article distribution of Wikivoyage can be seen on a special page The Italian branch of Wikivoyage was launched on December 10, 2007. The organization of media data and the administration of user access were already applicable for use in branches in other languages.

Additional languages and migration In 2012, after a lengthy history of dissatisfaction with Wikitravel's host and owner, Internet Brands, it was proposed that the community at Wikitravel fork their work from Wikitravel and Wikitravel Shared and ‚Äì together with the existing sites at Wikivoyage ‚Äì merge to create a new travel wiki hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation, the steward of Wikipedia and a large range of other non- profit reference sites based upon a wiki community culture. After lengthy discussion by users of all three communities, comments by their respective hosts, and confirmation by the Wikimedia Foundation that it would host a travel project if users wished, nearly all administrators and bureaucrats at Wikitravel decided to fork their existing work to Wikivoyage. The contents of Wikitravel in all languages and its related Commons-equivalent site (for images, video, and other media files) were downloaded on August 2, 2012 as a \\"database dump\\" in preparation for such a migration. This content became the starting point for all languages excluding German and Italian, which were already hosted by Wikivoyage. Forking is a normal or anticipated activity in wiki communities and is expressly permitted by the Creative Commons‚ÄìAttribution‚ÄìShare Alike (CC BY-SA) copyright license in use on sites such as Wikitravel. MediaWiki, the wiki software used for Wikitravel, included that facility, although Internet Brands disabled the function shortly after this date in an attempt to prevent the data migration. The community discussion at Wikimedia ended on August 23, 2012 with 540 votes for and 152 votes against the creation of a Wikimedia Foundation travel guide. The project began in beta on WMF servers on November 10, 2012 and was launched fully on January 15, 2013. As part of the migration, it is planned that current owners and user body \\"Wikivoyage e.V.\\" will remain in place as an associated organization affiliated with the Wikimedia Foundation \\"at an organizational level\\". Wikivoyage stated that, freed of the need to maintain its servers, it would be able to benefit by increasing its work related to outreach, community support, discussion and information, and technical enhancements to the site's software.Wikimedia.org website October 25, 2012: states \\"In preparation of Wikivoyage becoming part of the new Wikimedia travel guide...\\" and \\"Wikivoyage e.V. plans to hand over its domain and the responsibility for operating the Wikivoyage project to the Wikimedia Foundation.

Part of this resolution is the goal to keep Wikivoyage as an association, becoming affiliated with Wikimedia on an organizational level.\\"See also Wikivoyage mailing list by Wikimedia Foundation] as at October 25, 2012: \\"The mailing list for Wikivoyage, a planned Wikimedia project\\" In September 2012, Internet Brands filed a lawsuit against one Wikitravel administrator, Ryan Holliday, and one Wikipedia administrator, James Heilman, accusing them of trademark breach and commercial misconduct in the proposals affecting that site, with the defendants and Wikimedia rejecting the case as an example of a SLAPP lawsuit‚Äîone that is undertaken without plausible legal grounds for the primary purpose of deterring, overwhelming, or frustrating people engaged in fully lawful actions. On November 19, 2012, the claims by Internet Brands were dismissed by the United States District Court for the Central District of California.  Evolution  English Wikivoyage experiences a constant increase in number of articles (about +1% per month) and a stable amount of activity (about 300 monthly active users and 800 total monthly editors).

He was born in Sheffield. Stenton was a right-handed batsman and a slow left-arm bowler. Somerset, searching for a slow left-armer to replace Horace Hazell, who had left the staff at the end of the 1952 season, played him in the match against Surrey at the County Ground, Taunton at the end of May 1953. But his two overs in Surrey's first innings cost 26 runs, and though he took the wicket of David Fletcher in the second innings, it was not enough to keep his place in the side. A few matches later, the 17-year-old Brian Langford, an off-spin bowler, took 14 wickets in his second match for Somerset, and opened up alternative spinning options. And John McMahon, who took five first innings wickets for Surrey in the game that Stenton appeared in, was signed by Somerset as a slow left-arm bowler for 1954. Stenton did not play first-class cricket again after this one appearance. ==References== * CricketArchive.com Category:1924 births Category:English cricketers Category:Somerset cricketers Category:Living people Category:Cricketers from Sheffield Category:English cricketers of 1946 to 1968 ","title":"John Stenton"},{"id":"12362898","text":"The Turpin Site (33Ha28Huebchen, Karl Raymond. \\"The Ronald Watson Gravel Site (15Be249): An examination of the Late Woodland/Fort Ancient transition in Boone County, Kentucky\\". Thesis, University of Cincinnati, 2006, 28. Accessed 2010-111-03.) is an archaeological site in the southwestern portion of the U.S. state of Ohio. Located near Newtown in Hamilton County, the site includes the remains of a village of the Fort Ancient culture and of multiple burial mounds. Detailed explorations of the site have revealed the bodies of many individuals in and around the mounds. The archaeological value of the site has resulted in its use in the study of similar locations and in its designation as a historic site. ==Excavations== Local residents began to explore the Turpin Site at the end of the eighteenth century. At this time, it appears that at least three mounds were located in the vicinity of the main village site, as well as a Native American cemetery. This cemetery was a primary focus of an excavation in 1800, which resulted in the unearthing of fifty skeletons.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 1. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 680. In 1881, the premier mound at the site ‚Äî then on the farmstead of Philip Turpin ‚Äî was recorded as being known as one of the principal prehistoric sites in Anderson Township; at that time, it stood high, and its base had a circumference of . Due to its size and location along the road between Cincinnati and Batavia, it was a local landmark. Surrounding the mound was the densest portion of the cemetery; a local historian noted that \\"human remains may be exhumed with almost every lift of spade or shovel.\\"Ford, Henry A., et al. History of Hamilton County Ohio. Cleveland: Williams, 1881, 243-244. Other mounds at the site included a stone mound believed to have been built during the Late Woodland period and an earth mound dating from the Fort Ancient period. During the late nineteenth century, two of the smaller mounds at the site were excavated under the direction of Charles Metz, and the Fort Ancient mound (the primary mound at the site) was investigated in 1947 by an expedition sponsored by the Cincinnati Museum of Natural History. Charles Metz had reported that this mound had apparently been reduced by the Turpin family, and a scholar writing in 1997 has proposed that it once was large enough to cover the burials found around it. This is not to say that the mound was found to be empty of burials; over sixty bodies were found to have been interred within it. While both adults and children were buried within many Fort Ancient mounds, the presence of many infant bodies in the Turpin mound distinguishes it from some other mounds of the period. Unlike many Fort Ancient mounds, this mound was found to include no structures underneath the actual mound, and few bodies were accompanied by grave goods. ==Contemporary understanding== The professional excavations of the twentieth century revealed that the Turpin Site was primarily a Fort Ancient village, although some Late Woodland influence was also present. Writing in 1966, archaeologist James Griffin classified Turpin and the nearby Sand Ridge Site within the Madisonville Focus of the Fort Ancient culture.Brady-Rawlins, Kathleen. The O.C. Voss Site: Reassessing What We Know about the Fort Ancient Occupation of the Central Scioto Drainage and Its Tributaries. Diss. Ohio State University, 2007. Accessed 2010-04-12. Twenty years later, a study of the chronology of the Fort Ancient culture assigned Turpin to the Early Fort Ancient period and the Madisonville Site to the Late Fort Ancient period. The typical resident of an Early Fort Ancient village lived in a single-family house, unlike the larger multiple-family houses found at villages such as the Madisonville Site in Mariemont, just across the Little Miami River from Newtown.DeLorme. Ohio Atlas & Gazetteer. 7th ed. Yarmouth: DeLorme, 2004, 75. . Based on artifacts found at the site, such as decorated ceramics and tempered pottery, the study's author concluded that the site's inhabitants were influenced by Mississippian groups such as the people of the Angel Phase. Among the distinctive features of Turpin pottery is the presence of guilloch√© whose holes include smaller holes at their centers; this feature has also been found at two other sites in the valley of the Little Miami. Writing in 1986, Wesley Cowan proposed Turpin as a type site for a phase of the Fort Ancient culture in southwestern Ohio, lasting from AD 1000 to 1250. ==Recognition== As one of southwestern Ohio's more significant archaeological sites, the Turpin Site has been used as a benchmark for the study of other Fort Ancient sites in the Ohio River watershed. In 2007, Kathleen Brady-Rawlins made extensive use of data from Turpin in her post excavation analysis of the O.C. Voss Site in western Franklin County, along with other sites in southern and central Ohio. Furthermore, the site has been recognized as worthy of prehistoric preservation by the National Park Service; it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. Four other sites in the Newtown vicinity, including the Madisonville Site, are also listed on the National Register. The Turpin Site and the surrounding farm are still owned by the Turpin family, which grows sod on the property.Farm History, Turpin Farms.

It is particularly noted for its feeling of monumental permanence. Under various ownership and through 1861, the building continued to serve as a hotel with restaurant and bar until sometime after 1912. The Victorian bar entrance featuring beer mugs in relief on stone pilasters beside the doorway and grapes cut into lintel above is of particular significance in the buildings architectural history and has been retained as a monument to the past. During the years until 1915, the inn served as a refuge to drivers, who herded cattle and hogs to the stockyards of Cincinnati, and to the haulers, who teamed huge loads of hay to livery stables and horse barns in the city. Throughout Prohibition Days, the inn gained new life as a Road House with dancing, live bands and entertainment. In later years, the original structure as expanded to accommodate additional business.

Two and a half stories tall, it is topped with a hip roof; the general style is Queen Anne, although when built it was much closer to the typical Gothic Revival residence. The facade is divided into two bays, with two windows in each; the bay on the right (as seen from the street) rises to a gable and is pierced by four windows, while the left bay stops at the normal roofline and features the main entrance. A side entrance with portico is placed farther to the rear, underneath another subsidiary gable. ==Historic context== Good transportation is a leading reason for Wyoming's prosperity. The city lies near the old pre- statehood road that connected Cincinnati with locations farther north, such as Fort Hamilton and Fallen Timbers. Curves in the road were cut off in 1806, forming a new road that is today followed by Springfield Pike through central Wyoming. Improvements in the 1830s only enhanced its importance. By this time, another mode of transportation had become significant: the Miami and Erie Canal was built a short distance to the east in 1828, and the village of Lockland grew up along its side. Railroads reached the city in 1851 with the construction of the Cincinnati, Hamilton, and Dayton Railroad on the border between Lockland and Wyoming. Because of Wyoming's proximity to the industry of Lockland, its easy transportation to the booming city of Cincinnati, and its pleasant scenery, many wealthy industrialists purchased local farms and built grand country houses. Most such houses were built in the Wyoming Hills area, west of Springfield Pike; growth in this area continued until the coming of the Great Depression. ==Robert Reily== Born in 1820 in Butler County to the north, Robert Reily was the son of pioneer educator John Reily, who started Cincinnati's earliest school in 1790 after military service during the American Revolution. Young Reily went into business at a comparatively young age, finding employment at a store that sold imported textiles; he began as a clerk, but he eventually rose to become the owner before selling the business and retiring in 1859, aged less than forty years. Reily had the present house built in 1854 on a hilltop above the valley of Mill Creek. The grandest of the old houses in the Wyoming Hills area, it was constructed to be comparable to the Gothic Revival houses that wealthy men were building in Cincinnati at the time. In the early 1860s, when local residents decided to organize their small community and give it a name, Twin Oaks was chosen as the meeting place. Those present were initially unable to agree on a name, but Reily's support for \\"Wyoming\\" won over the other men, and when the village was incorporated, he was chosen as the first mayor. Only for a short time did he occupy this position; the Civil War was being fought, and before long Reily entered military service. As lieutenant colonel of the 75th Ohio Volunteer Infantry, he was killed at the Battle of Chancellorsville in 1863. ==Historic site== In 1975, Twin Oaks was listed on the National Register of Historic Places; it qualified both because of its historically significant architecture and because of its connection to Robert Reily. Four years later, a local historic preservation group began a citywide survey to identify Wyoming's historic buildings, and this effort culminated with a multiple property submission of eighteen houses, the Wyoming Presbyterian Church, and one historic district to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Twin Oaks was one of the houses included in this group; it was listed on the Register for a second time, even though it had never been removed. ==References== Category:Houses completed in 1854 Category:Houses in Wyoming, Ohio Category:Gothic Revival architecture in Ohio Category:National Register of Historic Places in Hamilton County, Ohio Category:Queen Anne architecture in Ohio ","title":"Twin Oaks (Wyoming, Ohio)"},{"id":"12362920","text":"The Underwriters Salvage Corps is a historic building in Cincinnati, Ohio, United States.

Local insurance companies formed the Underwriters Salvage Corps in 1886 at the end of a four-year-long process of negotiations. As a salvage corps, their goal was largely to assist firefighters in danger zones: employees rushed to burning buildings to try to save both lives and property, and they were accorded the same status as official firefighters while at fire zones.

Among the most distinctive elements of its architecture is a large Gothic window on the front facade. Except for the front, the church is surrounded by its cemetery, which is of a date approximately equal to the church building.

Accessed 2010-11-15. As this situation continued for decades, in 1830 Armstrong donated one of the best pieces of his land for the construction of a church and cemetery. The church was erected in the summer of 1831 under the leadership of Samuel Earhart; its walls, built of brick,, Ohio Historical Society, 2007. Accessed 2010-11-15. were constructed from locally made bricks whose clay originated on Earhart's property. The adjacent cemetery had already been founded; its first burial was Hannah Armstrong, who had died four years before the church's completion in the fall of 1831. Nathanial Armstrong provided that the church be made available for the use of whichever denomination had the greatest number of members in the vicinity. Both at that time and at all times since, the church has been used by Methodists. Relatively few changes have been made to the building since its construction; a tower was added in 1890, but only minor repairs have been carried out otherwise. Although the foundation was built of fieldstones and held together by soil rather than mortar, it has moved only slightly; a restoration performed in the 1970s demonstrated that the building had settled just in 140 years.The History of Armstrong Chapel , Armstrong Chapel, n.d.

Pape House, and the Washington Heights School. Armstrong qualified for inclusion on the Register because of its place in local history, because of its connection to locally prominent individual Nathanial Armstrong, and because of its well-preserved historic architecture. The historic site designation encompassed the Armstrong cemetery, as well as the church building. Today, Armstrong Chapel continues as an active congregation of the United Methodist Church. As the congregation grew in the early twenty-first century, a new building was deemed necessary; a groundbreaking ceremony was held at the end of August 2009, and the new structure was substantially completed in October of the following year.Building Campaign , Armstrong Chapel United Methodist Church, 2010.

As a result of their origins, the communities' architecture (especially that of East Addyston, which was almost completely residential) was unusually homogenous; what few distinctive buildings were built were in Sekitan, the older portion. The conceptual difference between the two portions of the village endured long after the municipal merger; separate post offices served the two portions into the 1930s, and as late as the 1960s, they were often regarded as separate communities.

Its unusual architecture mixes plain, unadorned elements with certain Romantic elements that is common in French Provincial buildings in the United States. In 1849, the house was converted into a rectory for the newly founded St. Francis de Sales Catholic Church. Given its new role, the house became a leading part of the Catholic Church's presence in the neighborhood. With the construction of the new church building on an adjacent lot in 1851, the parish priest moved into the house, and it was also used as the parish school in its earliest years. Additionally, the house may have served a more surreptitious purpose: local legend holds that a room in the rear of the basement was employed as a station on the Underground Railroad. In 1877, the parish began to build its present complex of buildings on Woodburn Avenue in Walnut Hills. After the completion of the new property, the parish sold the property; it was later used as the private residence of a family named Baumgartner.

The last remnant of a landmark church building, it was designed by a leading Cincinnati architect and built in the 1880s. Although named a historic site a century after its construction, the building was mostly destroyed after extensive neglect caused restoration to become prohibitively expensive. ==History== Pioneer Presbyterian minister James Kemper helped to organize a Presbyterian congregation in the area of Walnut Hills in 1818. After sixty years, the congregation merged with another one, which worshipped at the nearby Lane Theological Seminary, and before long the united congregation needed a larger building. Prominent architect Samuel Hannaford was chosen to produce the design.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 1. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 685. Hannaford had already gained a reputation as one of Cincinnati's best architects, following his production of Music Hall in the 1870s, and the city's growth provided plenty of demand for the services of such an architect;Gordon, Stephen C., and Elisabeth H. Tuttle. '. National Park Service, 1978-12-11. by the late 1870s, he had already completed designs for churches such as St. George's Catholic Church and St. Luke's Episcopal Church. His design for the Presbyterians in Walnut Hills resembled some of the others, with a large corner tower, a prominent steeple with spire, walls faced with ashlar, and a general Gothic Revival appearance. It was twice expanded: a chapel was constructed in 1891, and Hannaford's company added a larger section in 1929, but these additions had been removed by the late 1970s. By the early 2000s, the building was no longer used for ecclesiastical purposes; preservation groups attempted to find a buyer to renovate it, suggesting that it be used for purposes such as a community center or offices for a film production firm. However, the building was ultimately destroyed: the neighboring funeral home needed the land in order to expand its parking lot, while the building's condition was poor enough that restoration seemingly would have required millions of dollars. Deconstruction began in early 2003, with the removal of stained glass and asbestos,Aldridge, Kevin. \\"Demolition Begins on Historic Church\\", Cincinnati Enquirer, 2003-03-11. and the building was largely demolished by mid-year. Preservationists were able to save part of the building, paying $160,000 to buy the church's tower and arrange to except it from demolition; their goal has been to ensure its structural stability and create a small monument around it, ensuring the church's partial continuation in the neighborhood's built environment.Aldridge, Kevin. \\"Renovation To Begin at Antislavery Site\\", Cincinnati Enquirer, 2003-12-04. ==Architecture== Although faced with stone, the church was actually built of brick on a stone foundation and covered with a slate roof., Ohio Historical Society, 2007. Accessed 2014-01-02. Two and a half stories tall, it was constructed with an irregular floor plan, while the exterior walls rose to a large gable near the bell tower on the corner. Dominating the fenestration was a massive stained glass window in the gable, while the tower features Gothic windows on its lower stories and paired openings to the un-windowed belfry at its top. The spire is no longer in place on the tower; like the chapel and other additions, it had been removed by the late 1970s. Remaining in place next to the tower is an entrance, which prior to demolition sat in front of the church's four-bay southern side. Scattered other components of the building survived its demolition: part of the pulpit was given to a church in Ripley, the cornerstone from the 1818 church building was donated to other Presbyterians in the area, and numerous structural elements such as woodworking and stained glass were sold to members of the public. ==Historic site== In 1980, the church building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying because of its historically significant architecture; it was part of a group of more than fifty Hannaford-designed buildings submitted to the Register together as part of a multiple property submission.

The church occupies a corner lot at the heart of the Westwood neighborhood. A clear example of the Gothic Revival style, the church is distinguished by a tall steeple crowned by a yet taller spire. The overall massing of the building is composed by its multi-gabled form and extensive fenestration, filled with stained glass, and the exterior is covered with rough-faced ashlar stonework. Slates cover the roof, and elements of copper and sandstone are prominent, due to the copper covering on the eight-sided spire and the large sandstone lintels surrounding the windows in the belfry and the main section of the building. Much of the building's ornamentation is also placed on the steeple, including windows with fleurs de lis and quatrefoils in their designs, and buttresses supporting the overall structure. In 1974, central Westwood was designated a historic district, the Westwood Town Center Historic District, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and the church (now part of the United Methodist Church) was included as one of the district's contributing properties. Six years later, the church was individually listed on the Register, along with more than fifty other Hannaford-designed buildings in the Cincinnati area; like most of the other buildings in the group, it qualified for designation because of its historically significant architecture. ==References== Category:Churches completed in 1896 Category:Churches in Cincinnati Category:Gothic Revival architecture in Ohio Category:National Register of Historic Places in Cincinnati Category:United Methodist churches in Ohio Category:Historic district contributing properties in Ohio Category:Churches on the National Register of Historic Places in Ohio Category:Samuel Hannaford church buildings ","title":"Westwood United Methodist Church"},{"id":"12363037","text":"The James Whallon House is a historic former farmhouse in the village of Greenhills near Cincinnati, Ohio, United States.

Besides farming, he operated a distillery that produced whiskey and brandy, and he held office as a justice of the peace from 1818 to 1835. In his later years, he joined the temperance movement (and consequently closed his distillery) and participated in education, building a school on the site of his log cabin. Since Whallon's lifetime, his house has served a variety of purposes.

Established in 1824 and closed in 1916, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974 as a historic district. ==History== The origins of Whitewater trace back to a small group of settlers in southern Butler County, Ohio, who gathered together as Shakers in 1822, possibly earlier. In 1823, the members of three prominent Butler County families joined, and this community (which had no formal name) moved to a larger farm. Undoubtedly at the urging of an early convert, Miriam Agnew, the Union Village ministry increased its spiritual and material support for Whitewater, culminating in the first purchase of land for White Water by Union Village trustees in 1824. The newly gathered Believers were joined in 1824 by the Darby Plain Shakers, whose former New Light and Farnhamite preacher, Nathan Burlingame, was the first to arrive at White Water from that abandoned central Ohio community. The first years were difficult because their few acres were forested and poor for farming. Noting the deprivations of the group, Calvin Morrell wrote later at Union Village, \\"It was Lent with them nearly all year round.\\" In 1825, however, the Shakers were able to purchase of good land for a mill seat on the Dry Fork of the Whitewater River, and the new community moved again to the site of the White Water North Family. Union Village brethren arrived in 1826 to help establish the family. The brick Meeting House was completed in 1827, the same year that the Shakers' sawmill on the Dry Fork commenced operations. That year membership swelled when West Union was dissolved. In 1835 there were 42 females and 35 males, including children, in spite of defections during years just past. Another group that added to the ranks of the White Water Shakers were followers of William Miller. He predicted the exact moment in April 1844 for Christ's Second Coming. People wound up their earthly affairs, dressed in ascension robes, and waited. Miller set another date six months later, but that final judgment day passed, too. His disappointed followers, the Millerites or Second Adventists, were courted by the Shakers who convinced the Millerites that the Shakers had already experienced the Second Coming in a spiritual sense. At its peak with the conversion of the Millerites in 1846, White Water village comprised in Hamilton County and in Butler County on which 200 believers in two families worked the large farm and engaged in a variety of industries. The Shakers would purchase additional land and establish a third family in the 1850s, and they remained a vibrant community into the 1880s when the long, slow decline began. The White Water Shakers operated a grist mill, sawmill, and possibly a brewery. They raised broom corn and manufactured brooms, sold packaged garden seeds (grossing $5,704 in 1857), and maintained large apple orchards for the sale of applesauce and cider. Other industries included sorghum molasses, honey, and preserved currents, grapes, and strawberries. The Shakers also raised silkworms for the manufacture of their own shawls, scarves, and handkerchiefs. In the final years of the community, the Believers were well known for raising fish in two Shaker-made ponds and for selling turkey eggs. The Civil War affected the Whitewater community. In April 1863, Morgan's Raiders passed through the community. Because a mill worker warned the rest of the community of the approach of the Raiders and the Shakers quickly hid their horses, only two horses were stolen. However, pursuing Union cavalrymen troops arrived on the following day, and they too took horses. After 30 years of decline and a change in leadership, in 1911 the Union Village ministry decided to lease the South, Center, and North Family farms. The remaining Shakers resided in the Office until 1916, when the farms were sold. Land owned by the community over its 94 years of existence included in Hamilton County, in Butler County, and in Clinton County ‚Äì totaling . December 4, 1916, marked the final land sale and the departure of Elder Andrew Barrett and Eldress Mary Gass. Elder Barrett went to Hancock, the Shaker community near Pittsfield, Massachusetts. Eldress Mary Gass went to Mount Lebanon, New York, the leading Shaker community in the East. While the South and Center farms remained in agricultural use, the North Family land was subsequently divided and the brick Meeting House and Dwelling House passed to separate owners. In 1991, the Great Parks of Hamilton County District purchased much of the remaining White Water buildings and land. The Park District owns 23 original Shaker-built or Shaker- used structures, including the 1827 two-story meetinghouse (the only extant brick Shaker meetinghouse), the 1832-33 North Family dwelling, a brick Trustee's Office with its 1855 date stone, a brick shop, a frame broom shop, and numerous barns and farm outbuildings. In all, this is the largest collection of Shaker building in Ohio and represents one of the most intact of all the Shaker villages. == Notes  Further reading == *Boice, Martha, Dale Covington and Richard Spence.

Built in 1815, its oldest portion is a one-and-one-half-story building. Although it is primarily a frame structure, the house includes multiple elements of other materials, such as a brick firewall and a frieze with a bas- relief element. Its name is derived from two families that lived there for many years: the Wilders, resident from 1833 to 1879, and the Swaims, resident from 1917 to 1976.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 1. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999. The most significant event in the house's history was a major expansion around 1840; such an expansion was a common event in early Montgomery as it transitioned from a frontier settlement to an established community. Although most of Montgomery's nineteenth-century buildings date from the first half of the century, houses as old as the Wilder‚ÄìSwaim House are rare. It has been changed less by time than have many other surviving early houses; as a result, it has been seen as one of the area's best-preserved early Federal structure. In 1981, the Wilder‚ÄìSwaim House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, due to its well- preserved historic architecture. It is one of five locations in Montgomery that is listed on the Register, along with the Blair House, the Montgomery Saltbox Houses, the Universalist Church Historic District, and the Yost Tavern.

It was a stop on the Underground Railroad. == Historic uses == *Single Dwelling From the 1840s to the 1870s, well-to-do merchants and businessmen moved to the College Hill neighborhood of Cincinnati, making it a prestigious rural village characterized by large homes on spacious lots. The presence of two colleges in College Hill attracted abolitionist Presbyterian educators. These educational opportunities attracted Samuel and Sally Wilson, Presbyterians who had been criticized while living in Reading, Ohio, for their abolitionist view. Two of their seven children had previously attended the Cary Academy in College Hill and in 1848 their daughter Mary became a charter faculty member of the Ohio Female College there, which admitted women and employed female faculty. The Wilsons built their Greek Revival home in College Hill in 1849, after which it became a station on the Underground Railroad until at least 1852. During these years, ten members of the family lived in the house, including four adult children, three grandchildren, and an aunt. In this house the Wilson family made important contributions to the history of the community through their leadership in American educational, religious, political and civic events. The abolitionist efforts of three of the adult children, Mary Jane Wilson Pyle, Harriet Nesmith Wilson, and Joseph Gardner Wilson, are documented in many sources. Mary, widowed in 1848, had been teaching at the College since then, while the youngest daughter Harriet taught in local public schools for 30 years, and lived at the Wilson house from 1849 until her death at age 95 in 1920. The youngest son Joseph was also a local professor, and lived at home until 1852. Joseph collected apparel from the families of this students and cooperated in obtaining disguises for runaways. While the other four adults who lived in the house are not mentioned by name in existing documentation, they probably assisted fugitive slaves during the years that the house was used as a station. A local publication by the Cincinnati Historic Society states \\"All the Wilson children were active in the abolitionist movement and aided many Blacks to make their way north by supplying food, clothing, and a hiding place.\\" In the early 20th century several groups of elderly African American men returned to the house and asked to see the cellar where they had once hidden and recognized the Wilsons' former housekeeper, Christine Gramm, still living at the house where she had first been employed in the 1850s. An extensive letter written by Harriet Wilson in 1892 describes her family's efforts helping slaves escape through College Hill. On one occasion when pursuers were headed to College Hill to search for runaway slaves, Harriet state \\"The women being 'entertained' by our family were terribly frightened declaring 'that they would die rather than be taken and carried back.' Though quite large in size they were ready and willing to crawl through a small aperture into a dark cellar where they would be safe.\\" She states that her sister Mary \\"was for many years a teacher. . .and were living could give you vivid pictures of the workings of the Underground R.R., for but a few who traveled by it to College Hill, but who were encouraged by her words of cheer and aided by her helping hand.\\" Harriet worked in Cincinnati and returned to College Hill on the weekends. Prior to her trip home on Friday evenings, she was given the number of slaves en route to College Hill so the \\"stations\\" were ready for their arrival. She recalls that \\"frequently, when at home on Saturday and asking for some article of clothing, I would receive the reply, 'Gone to Canada.'\\" After the passage of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, Harriet recalled that \\"the work had become too well known. . . it was deemed wiser to have it carried on by other less exposed routes so in the years immediately preceding the civil war, there were comparatively none coming to the Hill yet those interested in the cause of human rights did their part financially to help in the work. . . .\\" The Samuel and Sally Wilson House is located at 1502 Aster Place, in Cincinnati, Ohio.

He had settled in Hamilton County one year previously, having been named the cashier of the Cincinnati branch of the Bank of the United States. By the end of the following year, he had constructed the present two-story frame structure. Composed of a central structure, wings on each side, and a rear ell, the house features a large, five-bay porch around its entrance; among the distinctive elements of this porch are wooden columns crafted in the Tuscan order. The design of the main entrance closely resembles that of the grand Baum-Taft House in Lytle Park, which was constructed in the following year.

After the McGregors, the house was home to the family of Guy Ward Mallon, a significant figure in the history of Ohio's political structure; he was responsible for introducing the Australian ballot into Ohio elections, for pioneering the effort to reorganize Cincinnati's city charter, and for writing a popular guide to elections.Cincinnati: A Guide to the Queen City and Its Neighbors.

Vassals in a feudal barony were thirled to their local mill owned by the feudal superior. People so thirled were called suckeners and were obliged to pay customary dues for use of the mill and help maintain it. ==Background== The term thirlage is a metathesis of Scots thrillage ‚Äòthralldom‚Äô, derived from thril ‚Äòthrall‚Äô, which was a body servant, retainer, or vassal to a noble or chief. The term is interchangeable with Scots carl (or English churl) and indicates subservience to the feudal superior and feudal laws; the situation being not that far removed from the conditions of slavery. The obligations of thirlage eventually ceased to apply, but thirlage in Scotland was only formally and totally abolished on 28 November (Martinmas) 2004 by the Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000. An identical feudal astriction existed and was enforced actively in feudal western Europe, e.g. mill soke in England,Querns and millstones banalit√© du moulin in France, banmolen in the Netherlands, M√ºhlenzwang in Germany. Thirlage was the feudal law by which the laird (superior) could force all those vassals living on his lands to bring their grain to his mill to be ground. The law ensured that all the grain the vassals produced could be measured and thus taxed. Vassals had to carry out repairs on the mill, maintaining the lade and weir as well as conveying new millstones to the site. Such trees as beech and particularly hornbeam were grown as a crop to provide the necessary wood for the mill machinery.Gauldie, Enid (1981). The Scottish Miller 1700 - 1900. Pub. John Donald. .Ferguson, Robert (2005). A Miller's Tale. The Life and Times of Dalgarven Mill. . The Thirlage Act was repealed in 1779 and after this many mills fell out of use as competition and unsubsidised running costs took their toll. This explains why so many mills ceased to be marked on maps after this date. Lambroch Mill for example was on the Annick Water near Stewarton in Ayrshire and apart from the weir and some other indications, it has entirely vanished, most likely because it was the thirlage mill for Lambroughton and its business went to Lainshaw or Cunninghamhead mill after the thirlage act was repealed. ==Sucken== Dalgarven Mill was previously thirled to the Blair Estate in North Ayrshire. The ‚Äòsucken‚Äô was the area over which a mill held thirlage over tenants and a ‚Äòsuckener‚Äô (or ‚Äòin-sucken multurer‚Äô) was a tenant thirled to a particular mill. The millers were obliged to enforce the adherence of tenants to the thirlage laws, since the income of the miller was based on that portion of the tenants' grain that the miller was legally entitled to take for the act of milling the grain. The legal term ‚Äòastricted‚Äô was applied to a tenant who was thirled or bonded to a particular mill. The term outsucken was applied to a mill which ground corn from outside its sucken for whatever reason. ==Multure== Multure (or mulcture), pronounced ‚Äòmooter‚Äô, was the name for the mill toll: a fixed proportion of the tenant's grain, paid to the miller by the suckener to grind the corn. The term ‚Äòdry multure‚Äô was often used, indicating the multure that a tenant had to pay, whether the grain was to be ground or not. Failure to take grain to the thirled mill was termed 'abstracted multure' and could result in the suckener being fined. The term 'bannock' denoted the payment to a miller's servant amounting to a handful of meal, in addition to that given as knaveship, this being a handful of cereal from each load milled. After the abolition of thirlage the term 'lick of goodwill' or 'lock' was the term for the miller's payment for grinding the cereal, etc. Aiton records in 1811 that barley, wheat, pease, beans, and every form of green crop were exempt from multure. ==Grassum== This was the payment, amounting to a year's rent, for a miller to enter into rights under the law of thirlage. This was a significant sum, and the miller was often forced to insist on his rights of multure to make a reasonable living.Warrack, Alexander (1982).\\"Chambers Scots Dictionary\\". Chambers. . By 1811 grassum was almost unknown in Ayrshire.Aiton, William (1811). General View of The Agriculture of the County of Ayr; observations on the means of its improvement; drawn up for the consideration of the Board of Agriculture, and Internal Improvements, with Beautiful Engravings. Glasgow. Page 173 ==Dishonesty== The Scots term mill- bitch was used for a bag hung near the millstones into which a dishonest miller would slip a handful of meal now and then. The 'mill-ring' is the space between the millstones and the wooden frame. This space inevitably collected meal and was enlarged by unscrupulous millers to increase the amount that accumulated to their benefit. The term 'ring the mill' was used in common discourse to mean a 'cheat'. ==Quern-stones== The upper stone of a Scottish hand quern from Dalgarven Mill, North Ayrshire A hand quern being operatedGarnett, T. Observations on a Tour through the Highlands and part of the Western Isles of Scotland, particularly Staff and Icolmkill. Pub. T. Cadell. The Strand. P. 155. The legal requirement in Scotland for tenants to use the baron's mill meant that early leases of mills gave to the miller the legal right to break quern-stones which were being used in defiance of thirlage agreements. Many quern-stones are found in a broken condition, maybe having been broken purposely according to thirlage law. == The 1799 Thirlage Act == The Act allowed those suckeners bound by thirlage to make a one-off payment that 'bought' them out of the various legal requirements:- And whereas there is a kind of thirlage known in the law and practice of Scotland, called a thirlage of the invecta et illata, to which sundry towns, burghs, burghs of barony, villages or other places in that part of the kingdom and the inhabitants thereof are subject, which thirlage it is expedient to allow to be purchased by the persons subject to the same: Be it therefore enacted, that if any inhabitant or inhabitants of such town, burgh, village or place, shall be desirous to purchase an exemption from the said servitude of thirlage, and all and every the services and prestations incident thereto, to which the whole town, burgh, village or place is liable, from the proprietor of such mill or mills entitled to the same, it shall be lawful and competent to them to apply in manner above mentioned to the sheriff or steward depute of the county in which such town, burgh, village or place is situate, who shall take such proceedings and summon a jury in such manner as is herein-before particularly directed, which jury shall by their verdict fix and determine the full value in money of such right of thirlage in perpetuity; on which verdict and determination the said sheriff or steward depute or substitute shall pronounce decreet against the person or persons so petitioning or applying to him as aforesaid for the sum so fixed and determined by such jury; on payment of which to the proprietor of the mill, such town, burgh, village or place, or such inhabitant or inhabitants thereof, formerly subject to such thirlage, shall thenceforth be for ever freed and relieved from the same. '' The Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000 finally ended any obligation of thirlage which has not been extinguished before the appointed day is extinguished on that day. == Transporting millstones == Under thirlage the suckeners had to convey new millstones to their thirled mill, sometimes over significant distances. The width of some of the first roads was determined by the requirement to have at least two people on either side of a new grindstone being transported, with a wooden axle called a 'mill-wand' passed through the hole in the centre. == Aid to the poor == Suckeners would place a small amount of grain in a bag at the mill which would be used to help feed the poor or those suffering hard times. ==See also== *List of Acts of Parliament of the United Kingdom Parliament, 1780-1800 *Museum of Ayrshire Country Life and Costume == References External links== *A Researcher's Guide to Local History terminology Category:Feudalism in the British Isles ","title":"Thirlage"},{"id":"12363153","text":"Young Women's Christian Association of Cincinnati is a historic building in Cincinnati, Ohio.

She ultimately had to flee the country because of Jihadis. ==2002 Nigeria riots== Isioma Daniel studied journalism and politics for three years at the University of Central Lancashire, graduating in summer of 2001. Her first job as a journalist was at Thisday, a Lagos-based national daily newspaper. As a fashion writer, she authored a November 16, 2002 comment piece on Miss World beauty pageant that was to be held in Nigeria later that year. Addressing opposition to the contest from the Nigerian Muslim community, she made the following remark: :\\"The Muslims thought it was immoral to bring 92 women to Nigeria and ask them to revel in vanity. What would Mohammed think? In all honesty, he would probably have chosen a wife from one of them.\\" According to Daniel, the sentence was added at the last minute; she thought it was \\"funny, light hearted\\" and \\"didn't see it as anything anybody should take seriously or cause much fuss\\". However, that judgment quickly proved wrong, as the publication triggered violent religious riots that left more than 200 dead and 1,000 injured, while 11,000 people were made homeless. Thisday's offices in Kaduna were torched, despite the paper's apology and retraction on the front page. Daniel resigned from the newspaper the day after her article appeared. Soon after, fearing for her safety and worried about the impending interrogation by the Nigerian state security, she left the country for Benin. On 26 November 2002, an Islamist government of Zamfara State issued a fatwa against Isioma Daniel; in the words of Zamfara deputy governor Mamuda Aliyu Shinkafi, later broadcast on the local radio: :\\"Like Salman Rushdie, the blood of Isioma Daniel can be shed. It is abiding on all Muslims wherever they are to consider the killing of the writer as a religious duty.\\" While the Nigerian government denounced the judgement as \\"unconstitutional\\" and \\"null and void\\", Muslim leaders were divided over its validity, some arguing that the subsequent retraction and apology meant that the fatwa was inappropriate. Thus Lateef Adegbite, Secretary-General of the Nigerian Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs, was quick to reject the death penalty since Daniel was not Muslim and the newspaper had apologised publicly. ==Exile in Europe== Isioma Daniel eventually went into exile in Europe, her resettlement guided by the Committee to Protect Journalists and Amnesty International. ==See also== * Vebj√∏rn Selbekk *List of fatwas ==References== Category:1981 births Category:Living people Category:Alumni of the University of Central Lancashire Category:Fatwas Category:Islam-related controversies Category:Nigerian expatriates in the United Kingdom Category:Nigerian newspaper journalists Category:People from Lagos Category:Nigerian refugees Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:Nigerian women journalists Category:21st-century journalists ","title":"Isioma Daniel"},{"id":"12363174","text":"is a railway station in Tamba-Sasayama, Hyogo, Japan, on the Fukuchiyama Line (JR Takarazuka Line) operated by West Japan Railway Company.

Part I. For Children from Two to Three Years Old. London: Printed for J. Johnson, No. 72, St. Paul's Church-Yard, 1801. [Price Six Pence.]\\" Lessons for Children is a series of four age-adapted reading primers written by the prominent 18th-century British poet and essayist Anna Laetitia Barbauld. Published in 1778 and 1779, the books initiated a revolution in children's literature in the Anglo-American world. For the first time, the needs of the child reader were seriously considered: the typographically simple texts progress in difficulty as the child learns. In perhaps the first demonstration of experiential pedagogy in Anglo-American children's literature, Barbauld's books use a conversational style, which depicts a mother and her son discussing the natural world. Based on the educational theories of John Locke, Barbauld's books emphasise learning through the senses. One of the primary morals of Barbauld's lessons is that individuals are part of a community; in this she was part of a tradition of female writing that emphasised the interconnectedness of society. Charles, the hero of the texts, explores his relationship to nature, to animals, to people, and finally to God. Lessons had a significant effect on the development of children's literature in Britain and the United States. Maria Edgeworth, Sarah Trimmer, Jane Taylor, and Ellenor Fenn, to name a few of the most illustrious, were inspired to become children's authors because of Lessons and their works dominated children's literature for several generations. Lessons itself was reprinted for over a century. However, because of the disrepute that educational writings fell into, largely due to the low esteem awarded Barbauld, Trimmer, and others by contemporary male Romantic writers, Barbauld's Lessons has rarely been studied by scholars. In fact, it has only been analysed in depth since the 1990s. ==Publication, structure, and pedagogical theory== Publication and structure Lessons depicts a mother teaching her son. Presumably, many of the events were inspired by Barbauld's experiences of teaching her own adopted son, her nephew Charles, as the events correlate with his age and growth.McCarthy, 92. Although there are no surviving first edition copies of the works, children's literature scholar Mitzi Myers has reconstructed the probable publication dates from Barbauld's letters and the books' earliest reviews as follows: Lessons for Children of two to three (1778); Lessons for Children of three, part I (1778); Lessons for Children of three, part II (1778); and Lessons for Children of three to four (1779).Myers, 282, n. 17. After its initial publication, the series was often published as a single volume. Barbauld's Lessons for Children, part 2, the first part for children of three (1779 Dublin edition); demonstrating wide spacing and large typealt=Page reads: \\"It is August. Let us go into the corn fields to see if the corn is almost ripe. Yes, it is quite brown: it is ripe. Farmer Diggory! you must bring a sharp sickle and cut down the corn ; it is ripe. Eat some, Charles; rub it \\" Barbauld demanded that her books be printed in large type with wide margins, so that children could easily read them; she was more than likely the \\"originator\\" of this practice, according to Barbauld scholar William McCarthy, and \\"almost certainly [its] popularizer\\".McCarthy, 88; see also, O'Malley, 57 and Pickering, 146. In her history of children's literature in The Guardian of Education (1802‚Äì1806), Sarah Trimmer noted these innovations, as well as the use of good-quality paper and large spaces between words.Pickering, 146. While making reading easier, these production changes also made the books too expensive for the children of the poor, therefore Barbauld's books helped to create a distinct aesthetic for the middle-class children's book.Robbins, \\"Teaching Mothers\\", 137. Barbauld's texts were designed for the developing reader, beginning with words of one syllable and progressing to multi-syllabic words.O'Malley, 57; see also Jackson, 129 and Robbins, \\"Teaching Mothers\\", 140. The first part of Lessons includes simple statements such as: \\"Ink is black, and papa's shoes are black. Paper is white, and Charles's frock is white.\\"Barbauld, Lessons for Children, from Two to Three Years Old, 29‚Äì30. The second part increases in difficulty: \\"February is very cold too, but the days are longer, and there is a yellow crocus coming up, and the mezereon tree is in blossom, and there are some white snow-drops peeking up their little heads.\\"Barbauld, Lessons for Children, of Three Years Old. Part I, 12. Barbauld also \\"departs from previous reading primers by introducing elements of story, or narrative, piecemeal before introducing her first story\\": the narrator explains the idea of \\"sequentiality\\" to Charles, and implicitly to the reader, before ever telling him a story.McCarthy, 95. For example, the days of the week are explained before Charles's trip to France. Pedagogical theory Barbauld's Lessons emphasises the value of all kinds of language and literacy; not only do readers learn how to read but they also acquire the ability to understand metaphors and analogies.Myers, 270‚Äì71. The fourth volume in particular fosters poetic thinking and as McCarthy points out, its passages on the moon mimic Barbauld's poem \\"A Summer Evening's Meditation\\":McCarthy, 103. { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" + ! Lessons for Children !! !! \\"A Summer Evening's Meditation\\" -  The Moon says My name is Moon; I shine to give you light in the night when the sun is set. I am very beautiful and white like silver. You may look at me always, for I am not so bright as to dazzle your eyes, and I never scorch you. I am mild and gentle. I let even the little glow-worms shine, which are quite dark by day. The stars shine all round me, but I am larger and brighter than the stars, and I look like a large pearl amongst a great many small sparkling diamonds. When you are asleep I shine through your curtains with my gentle beams, and I say Sleep on, poor little tired boy, I will not disturb you.Barbauld, Lessons for Children from Three to Four Years Old, 105‚Äì07.   A tongue in every star that talks with man, And wooes him to be wise; nor wooes in vain: This dead of midnight is the noon of thought, And wisdom mounts her zenith with the stars. At this still hours the self-collected soul Turns inward, and beholds a stranger there Of high descent, and more than mortal rank; An embryo GOD; a spark of fire divine, Which must burn on for ages, when the sun, (Fair transitory creature of a day!) Has clos'd his golden eye, and wrapt in shades Forgets his wonted journey thro' the east. (lines 49‚Äì60)Barbauld, Anna Laetitia. \\"A Summer Evening's Meditation\\".

The typographical layout of Barbauld's predecessors contrasts with her wide margins and large letters in Lessons for Children.alt=Title page, which is crowded with fonts of varying sizes and shapes, reads \\"The Protestant Tutor, Instructing YOUTH, and Others, In the Compleat Method of Spelling, Reading, and Writing True English; Also, Discovering to them the Notorious ERRORS, Damnable DOCTRINES, and Cruel MASSACRES, of the Bloddy Papists; Which England may Expect from a Popish Successor. With Instructions for Grounding them in the True Protestant Religion.\\" Barbauld also developed a particular style that would dominate British and American children's literature for a generation: an \\"informal dialogue between parent and child\\", a conversational style that emphasised linguistic communication.McCarthy, 88‚Äì89; see also Myers, 270‚Äì71. Lessons starts out monopolised by the mother's voice but slowly, over the course of the volumes, Charles's voice is increasingly heard as he gains confidence in his own ability to read and speak. This style was an implicit critique of late 18th-century pedagogy, which typically employed rote learning and memorisation. Barbauld's Lessons also illustrates mother and child engaging in quotidian activities and taking nature walks. Through these activities, the mother teaches Charles about the world around him and he explores it. This, too, was a challenge to the pedagogical orthodoxy of the day, which did not encourage experiential learning.Myers, 261; Robbins, \\"Teaching Mothers\\", 142. The mother shows Charles the seasons, the times of the day, and different minerals by bringing him to them rather than simply describing them and having him recite those descriptions. Charles learns the principles of \\"botany, zoology, numbers, change of state in chemistry ... the money system, the calendar, geography, meteorology, agriculture, political economy, geology, [and] astronomy\\".McCarthy, 100. He also inquires about all of them, making the learning process dynamic. Barbauld's pedagogy was fundamentally based on John Locke's Some Thoughts Concerning Education (1693), the most influential pedagogical treatise in 18th-century Britain.Pickering, 147; Richardson, 128. Building on Locke's theory of the Association of Ideas, which he had outlined in Some Thoughts, philosopher David Hartley had developed an associationist psychology that greatly influenced writers such as Barbauld (who had read Joseph Priestley's redaction of it).Richardson, 128; Robbins, \\"Teachings Mothers\\", 142. For the first time, educational theorists and practitioners were thinking in terms of developmental psychology. As a result, Barbauld and the women writers she influenced produced the first graded texts and the first body of literature designed for an age-specific readership.Myers, 258. ==Themes== alt=Half-length profile portrait of woman wearing a bonnet Lessons not only teaches literacy, \\"it also initiates the child [reader] into the elements of society's symbol-systems and conceptual structures, inculcates an ethics, and encourages him to develop a certain kind of sensibility\\".McCarthy, 93. One of the series' overall aims is to demonstrate that Charles is superior to the animals he encounters‚Äîbecause he can speak and reason, he is better than they are. Lessons for Children, of Three Years Old, part 2 begins: Andrew O'Malley writes in his survey of 18th-century children's literature, \\"from helping poor animals [Charles] eventually makes a seamless transition to performing small acts of charity for the poor children he encounters\\".O'Malley 57; see also Richardson, 133. Charles learns to care for his fellow human beings through his exposure to animals. Barbauld's Lessons is not, therefore, Romantic in the traditional sense; it does not emphasise the solitary self or the individual. As McCarthy puts it, \\"every human being needs other human beings in order to live. Humans are communal entities\\".McCarthy, 97; see also Robbins, \\"Teaching Mothers\\", 139. Lessons was probably meant to be paired with Barbauld's Hymns in Prose for Children (1781), which were both written for Charles. As F. J. Harvey Darton, an early scholar of children's literature, explains, they \\"have the same ideal, in one aspect held by Rousseau, in another wholly rejected by him: the belief that a child should steadily contemplate Nature, and the conviction that by so doing he will be led to contemplate the traditional God\\".Darton, 152. However, some modern scholars have pointed to the lack of overt religious references in Lessons, particularly in contrast to Hymns, to make the claim that it is secular.McCarthy, 97. One important theme in Lessons is restriction of the child, a theme which has been interpreted both positively and negatively by critics. In what Mary Jackson has called the \\"new child\\" of the 18th century, she describes \\"a fondly sentimentalized state of childishness rooted in material and emotional dependency on adults\\" and she argues that the \\"new good child seldom made important, real decisions without parental approval ... In short, the new good child was a paragon of dutiful submissiveness, refined virtue, and appropriate sensibility.\\"Jackson, 131. Other scholars, such as Sarah Robbins, have maintained that Barbauld presents images of constraint only to offer images of liberation later in the series: education for Barbauld, in this interpretation, is a progression from restraint to liberation, physically represented by Charles' slow movement from his mother's lap in the opening scene of first book, to a stool next to her in the opening of the subsequent volume, to his detachment from her side in the final book.Robbins, \\"Teaching Mothers\\", 140‚Äì42. ==Reception and legacy== alt=Oval inset half-length portrait of woman in flowing dress with a band of cloth wrapped around her head. Portrait it set against a backdrop of books, papers, pen, laurel, and a harp. Lessons for Children and Barbauld's other popular children's book, Hymns in Prose for Children, had an unprecedented impact; not only did they influence the poetry of William Wordsworth and William Blake, particularly Blake's Songs of Innocence and Experience (1789‚Äì94),McCarthy, 85‚Äì86. they were also used to teach several generations of schoolchildren both in Britain and the United States. Barbauld's texts were used to perpetuate the ideal of Republican motherhood in 19th-century America, particularly the notion of the mother as the educator of the nation.Robbins, \\"Re-making Barbauld's Primers\\", 158. British children's author and critic Charlotte Yonge wrote in 1869 that the books had taught \\"three-quarters of the gentry of the last three generations\\" to read.Pickering, 147. Poet Elizabeth Barrett Browning could still recite the beginning of Lessons at age thirty- nine.McCarthy, 85. Writers of all stamps immediately recognised the revolutionary nature of Barbauld's books. After meeting Barbauld, the famous 18th-century novelist Frances Burney described her and her books: Barbauld herself believed that her writing was noble and she encouraged others to follow in her footsteps. As Betsy Rodgers, her biographer, explains: \\"she gave prestige to the writing of juvenile literature, and by not lowering her standard of writing for children, she inspired others to write on a similar high standard\\".Rodgers, 72. In fact, because of Barbauld, Sarah Trimmer and Hannah More were galvanised to write for poor children and to organise a large-scale Sunday School movement. Ann and Jane Taylor began writing children's poetry, the most famous of which is \\"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star\\". Ellenor Fenn wrote and designed a series of readers and games for middle-class children, including the best-selling Cobwebs to Catch Flies (1784). Richard Lovell Edgeworth began one of the first systematic studies of childhood development which would culminate not only in an educational treatise co-authored with Maria Edgeworth entitled Practical Education (1798), but also in a large body of children's stories by Maria, beginning with The Parent's Assistant (1798). Thomas Day originally began his important The History of Sandford and Merton (1783‚Äì89) for Edgeworth's collection, but it grew too long and was published separately.Myers, 261; see also Richardson, 129‚Äì30; Darton, 164; Jackson, 134‚Äì36; O'Malley, 57; Robbins, \\"Teaching Mothers\\", 139. In the second half of the 1790s, Barbauld and her brother, the physician John Aikin, wrote a second series of books, Evenings at Home, aimed at more advanced readers, ages eight to twelve.Richardson, 130. While not as influential, these were also popular and remained in print for decades. Lessons was reprinted, translated, pirated, and imitated until the 20th century; according to Myers, it helped found a female tradition of educational writing.Myers, 260. alt=Title reads \\"An Easy Introduction to the Knowledge of Nature, and Reading the Holy Scriptures. Adapted to the Capacities of Children.\\" While Day, for example, has been hailed as an educational innovator, Barbauld has most often been described through the unsympathetic words of her detractors. The politician Charles James Fox and the writer and critic Samuel Johnson ridiculed Barbauld's children's books and believed that she was wasting her poetic talents.Rodgers, 71. In his Life of Johnson (1791), James Boswell recorded Johnson's thoughts: Barbauld had published a successful book of poetry in 1773 which Johnson greatly admired; he viewed her switch to children's literature as a descent. The most damning and lasting criticism, however, came from the Romantic essayist Charles Lamb in a letter to the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge: This quote was used by writers and scholars to condemn Barbauld and other educational writers for a century. As Myers argues: It is only in the 1990s and 2000s that Barbauld and other female educational writers are beginning to be acknowledged in the history of children's literature and, indeed, in the history of literature itself.McCarthy, William. \\"A 'High-Minded Christian Lady': The Posthumous Reception of Anna Letitia Barbauld\\". Romanticism and Women Poets: Opening the Doors of Reception. Eds. Harriet Kramer Linkin and Stephen C. Behrendt. Lexington: University Press of Kentucky (1999), 183‚Äì85. As Myers points out, \\"the writing woman as teacher has not captured the imagination of feminist scholars\\",Myers, 262. and Barbauld's children's works are usually consigned to \\"the backwaters of children's literature surveys, usually deplored for their pernicious effect on the emergent cultural construction of Romantic childhood, or in the margins of commentary on male high Romanticism, a minor inspiration for Blake or Wordsworth perhaps\\". The male Romantics did not explore didactic genres that illustrated educational progress; rather, as Myers explains, their works embodied a \\"nostalgia for lost youth and [a] pervasive valorization of instinctive juvenile wisdom\\" not shared by many female writers at this time.Myers, 266. Serious scholarship is just beginning to investigate the complexities of Barbauld's Lessons; McCarthy, for example, has noted the resonances between Lessons and T. S. Eliot's The Waste Land that have yet to be explored: { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" + ! Lessons for Children !! !! The Waste Land -  Come, let us go home, it is evening. See ... how tall my shadow is. It is like a great black giant stalking after me ...Qtd. in McCarthy, 86.

He spent his early childhood in K√∂nigsberg and Saxony; from 1945 to 1950 he lived in Grainau near Garmisch-Partenkirchen, and from 1950 in Freiburg im Breisgau. After gaining his Abitur in 1959 he studied German, history, and philosophy at the universities of Freiburg and Munich. In 1962 he continued his studies at the Free University of Berlin. In the federal election campaign of 1965 he worked together with a number of well-known writers in the Wahlkampfkontor (electoral office) of the SPD. During the 1960s Schneider experienced a political radicalisation that led him to become one of the spokespersons and organisers of the Berlin German student movement. In 1967 he was involved in the preparation of the so-called \\"Springer-Tribunal\\". He was a member of a group aiming to found a proletarian political party and rouse the working class. For this reason Schneider worked temporarily as an unskilled worker in one of the Bosch factories. Later he taught in a private school and did freelance work in broadcasting. In 1972 he received his degree, but in 1973 the education authorities in Berlin refused to appoint him as a trainee teacher on account of his political activity. That decision was overturned by a court in Berlin in 1976. Having in the meantime established himself as a writer, Schneider gave up the idea of teaching. His novel Lenz, published in 1973, had become a cult text for the German left, capturing the feelings of those disappointed by the failure of their utopian revolt. Since then, Schneider has written novels, short stories, and film scripts that often deal with the fate of members of his generation. Other works deal with the situation of Berlin before and after German reunification. Schneider is also a major essayist. Schneider has frequently held posts as visiting professor or writer in residence at universities in the United States, including Stanford, Harvard and Princeton. Since 2001 he has been the Roth Distinguished Writer- in-Residence at Georgetown University. He lives in Berlin. Schneider is a member of the German PEN Club. He is a recipient of a Villa Massimo scholarship (1979) and the F√∂rderpreis f√ºr Literatur des Kulturkreises of the Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie (1983). ==Works in English== * The Wall Jumper, New York 1984 * The German Comedy, New York 1990 * Couplings, New York 1996 * Eduard's Homecoming, New York 2000 * Berlin Now, Farrar, Straus and Giroux 2014 ==Secondary literature== * Alois Prinz: Der poetische Mensch im Schatten der Utopie, W√ºrzburg 1990 * Colin Riordan (ed.): Peter Schneider, Cardiff 1995 * Markus Meik: Peter Schneiders Erz√§hlung \\"Lenz\\", Siegen 1997 * Elizabeth Snyder Hook: Family secrets and the contemporary German novel, Rochester, NY [u. a.] 2001 * Gundula M.

A 2009 study of 26 European countries found that: \\"In France, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg and Portugal, couples are jointly assessed. Ireland and Germany operate joint taxation, respectively, with an option for individual taxation and the right to be individually taxed when this is more advantageous; conversely individual taxation is the default option in Spain and Poland, but the option of joint assessment is offered. Elements of jointness remain in some income tax codes for which the individual is the unit of taxation ‚Äì the Belgian, Estonian, Greek, Icelandic and Norwegian codes ‚Äì some of which are minor while others matter. The remaining countries enforce individual income taxation without exceptions\\". In 2015, Portugal abolished the mandatory joint taxation of a family, establishing separate taxation for married (or de facto unions) taxpayers as the norm, with an option being available for joint taxation. The International Monetary Fund has called for the countries to abandon the practice of taxing family income instead of individual income, along with other tax practices, such as the method of assessing payroll tax in the United States, which assesses extra taxes, higher tax rates, and reduced benefits to families that have two earners, and provides funded and unfunded subsidies to patriarchal families, which are related to sovereign debt problems in these countries. In the United States, the spouse to whom the income is fictionally attributed does not pay payroll tax on that \\"split\\" earned income, while the benefit of that spouse's lower rate does accrue to the greater earner. The \\"split\\" is thus ignored in that context while it is applied in the income tax context. Even though the fictionally earning spouse does not pay payroll tax, the couple draws two sets of Social Security and Medicare benefits. Declining fertility rates in countries that subsidize patriarchal/maternalist marriage and rebounding fertility rates in countries that shift their policies to recognizing equal parental responsibility are also a factor in many countries abandoning fictional income splitting for tax measurement. In part because of these concerns, as well as child welfare policies that advocate recognizing both parents having personal responsibility for children in order to support their development without distortion, fictional income splitting is becoming rare globally, and, since 1970, it has been abolished in many countries. Some countries require joint returns but measure the tax on income individually, while others use only individual returns. Tax laws in these countries generally have regulations preventing the direct transfer of earned income from one spouse to another to reduce taxes. There are often still methods of using income splitting to reduce taxes in these jurisdictions. For those who own their own company, hiring family members will often reduce the overall tax burden by shifting income to lower-income family members. == United States == In the United States, tax benefits or \\"marriage bonuses\\" to married couples with only one breadwinner (or with a breadwinner earning the bulk of the couple's income) have been cited by the Tax Policy Center as one of the debt- ballooning policies of the Bush tax cuts. The Tax Policy Center asserts that these \\"marriage bonuses\\" (received by the greater or sole earner in the marriage) and \\"marriage penalties\\" (paid by the lesser or non-earner in the marriage) are often subsidized by single people and two-earner marriages or are unfunded and thus contribute to government borrowing. While its effects on the national debt have increased substantially in recent years, income splitting became required for married persons filing jointly in the United States in 1948. After two successive vetoes by President Harry S. Truman, a GOP-led effort in Congress obtained enough votes to institute the splitting of marital income. Until then, only single filing was permitted. However, couples in community property states such as California had access to de facto fictional income splitting, since one-half of the income of one spouse could be fictionally attributed to the other spouse. This led to issues of patriarchal taxpayers in community property states paying lower tax rates than patriarchal taxpayers in common law states and hastened the passage of de jure income splitting. While other solutions to this distortion in community property states were available, political activism to establish a male entitlement (or first right) to paid work, and to push women back into unpaid or lower paid work after their substantial economic contributions during World War II, led to the override of Truman's double veto. Fictional income splitting is strongly opposed by people in two-earner marriages, and especially by those in Shared Earning/Shared Parenting Marriages. U.S. economists Betsey Stevenson and Justin Wolfers are among those who oppose it. The opposition also comes from those who see this type of taxation contributing to problems of child neglect, particularly by fathers, family breakdown, unequal pay for equal work problems for women, poverty in general, and the feminization of poverty, particularly in older women. == Germany == In Germany, income splitting involves two aspects. First, if married couples file jointly, their total tax liability is determined by twice the tax liability of applying half the total taxable income. Let y_1 and y_2 denote each spouse's taxable income. Defining T(.) the tax schedule, the tax due for couples is computed by 2 T\\\\left( \\\\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \\\\right) \\\\leq T(y_1) + T(y_2) . The splitting advantage increases if both partners have unequal incomes. Another consequence is a high marginal tax rate for the secondary earner, as he/she indirectly pays the marginal tax rate of the higher-earning spouse. The second aspect involves the Withholding tax (Lohnsteuer) which is paid on employment income. Family taxation implies that married couples may split the total basic exemption (Grundfreibetrag). This is done via choosing the appropriate tax bracket (Steuerklasse). The higher-earning spouse predominantly opts for Steuerklasse III, where he/she can claim both exemptions, while the lower- earning spouse will be taxed without exemption (Steuerklasse V). Both arrangements are widely considered to create an incentive for unequal employment within married couples in Germany, providing one cause for low labor force participation among married women. == Canada == Income splitting was not a part of Canada's tax system until the 21st century. From the introduction of income tax, Canadian households were almost exclusively deemed to be single income households. In 1962, a Royal Commission on Taxation was initiated under Kenneth Carter by Prime Minister John Diefenbaker to examine and to recommend improvements to the federal tax system. The report declared \\"that fairness should be the foremost objective of the taxation system; the existing system was not only too complicated and inefficient, but under it the poor paid more than their fair share while the wealthy avoided taxes through various loopholes.\\" From the Carter commission's report: :We conclude that the present system is lacking in essential fairness between families in similar circumstances and that attempts to prevent abuses of the system have produced serious anomalies and rigidities. Most of these results are inherent in the concept that each individual is a separate taxable entity. Taxation of the individual in almost total disregard for his inevitably close financial and economic ties with the other members of the basic social unit of which he is ordinarily a member, the family, is in our view another striking instance of the lack of a comprehensive and rational pattern in the present tax system. In keeping with our general theme that the scope of our tax concepts should be broadened and made more consistent in order to achieve equity, we recommend that the family be treated as a tax unit and taxed on a rate schedule applicable to family units. Individuals who are not members of a family unit would continue to be treated as separate tax units and would be taxed on a schedule applicable to individuals. The 1970 Royal Commission on the Status of Women recommended a system of elective joint taxation to address the issues of both tax fairness between families and concerns regarding disincentives for women's participation in the work force. Combined family income is used to calculate a family's tax liability as well as to determine a family's eligibility for tax-delivered benefit payments, such as the Canada Child Tax Benefit (CCTB). Households of similar gross incomes are bearing broadly different tax obligations. On an individual basis this is not the case. Households with the same total income are eligible for identical tax-delivered benefit payments but may have significantly different tax liabilities. Further, while bearing the same general costs of everyday life, such as child care, one jointly filing family is unable to experience greater tax relief (available to individually filing parents), due to the requirement that child care expenses be applied to the lower spouse's income. After enacting income splitting for retired couples in 2006, in 2011 the Conservative Party of Canada led by Stephen Harper won a majority government with a platform promising limited income splitting. The proposed policy would allow families, with children under 18, to split their household income of up to $50,000, once the federal budget was balanced. The Tories estimate that almost 1.8 million families would be able to capitalize on the tax package and they would save an average of $1,300 annually. A 2013 study by the C.D. Howe Institute concluded that incoming splitting \\"does more harm than good,\\" and a 2014 study by the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives claims that would primarily benefit wealthier families. However, the C.D. Howe Institute study went far beyond the scope of the limited proposal in the Conservative campaign platform by including the consequences of the provinces following suit. It also speculates upon the effects of workforce participation of the lower earning spouse which is easily addressed by elective joint taxation such as recommended by the 1970 Royal Commission on the Status of Women. In February 2014, a day after introducing the 2014 budget, Finance Minister Jim Flaherty distanced himself from the concept of income splitting, but others within the Cabinet still support the idea. With files from The Canadian Press. The 2015 Canadian federal budget proposed measures to allow families to split their income. ==See also== * Marriage penalty * Shared earning/shared parenting marriage ==References== Category:Income taxes ","title":"Income splitting"},{"id":"12363351","text":"Donald William Carlton Bird (5 January 1908 ‚Äì 1987) was an English professional footballer who played at outside left.

Created as a result of a merger of three smaller operators, the new entity became an important regional scheduled carrier during the 1970s, serving the Eastern half of Britain.\\"The forgotten schedules?\\", Flight International, 8 March 1973, p. 331 In 1980 Air Anglia merged with three regional rivals to form Air UK. ==History== Fokker F-28-1000 Fellowship in 1978 Air Anglia was the result of a three-way merger in 1970 between Anglian Air Charter, Norfolk Airways and Rig Air, three local air taxi operators based in the East of England. The new airline established its corporate headquarters as well as its main operating and engineering base at the recently established airport at Norwich in East Anglia. At the time of formation Norwich Union became its controlling shareholder. Air Anglia established itself as an important regional scheduled operator, as well as one of the main fixed wing operators supporting the British oil and gas industry in the North Sea during the 1970s. In 1980 Air Anglia merged with British Island Airways (BIA), Air Wales and Air Westward to form Air UK, at the time the UK's biggest regional airline and its third-largest scheduled operator. Commercial developments Air Anglia commenced operations with a small fleet of Douglas DC-3 \\"Dakota\\" piston-engined airliners (see heading image) as well as a number of smaller, \\"executive\\" type of aircraft inherited from its predecessors. With these aircraft it mainly operated oil and gas industry support flights from Norwich and Aberdeen as well as Humberside Airport. In 1971 it started internal services from Norwich to Liverpool, Dublin, Newcastle, Manchester, Edinburgh and Aberdeen. In 1974 Air Anglia added a pair of Fokker F-27 Friendship turboprops to its fleet. The introduction of these turboprops into the airline's fleet coincided with the launch of the company's first year- round scheduled services from its Norwich base to Aberdeen via Humberside and Teesside as well as from Norwich to Amsterdam. The scheduled services between Norwich, Humberside, Teesside and Aberdeen allowed Air Anglia to commercially exploit the regular positioning flights it had been operating between these points since its inception. Oil and gas industry related business travellers constituted a high proportion of this traffic. The launch of Air Anglia's first international scheduled service to Amsterdam also led to the conclusion of a joint marketing agreement with Dutch flag carrier KLM, at the time the biggest resident operator and dominant scheduled airline at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport. Under this agreement KLM agreed to host Air Anglia's new Norwich‚ÄîAmsterdam scheduled service, as well as any subsequently launched scheduled services linking regional UK airports not served by the KLM group with Amsterdam Schiphol, in its reservations computer. This gave travel agents worldwide instant access to Air Anglia's connecting flights to/from Amsterdam via KLM's Global Distribution System, thereby enabling Air Anglia to improve its passenger loads on these services as well as helping KLM to boost its long-haul loads by delivering it additional transfer traffic from the UK regions to its Schiphol base. In addition to these year-round scheduled services, Air Anglia also operated seasonal, summer only scheduled services from Norwich, Humberside and Aberdeen to Jersey. Air Anglia's seasonal Aberdeen‚ÄîJersey scheduled service was the longest non-stop scheduled operation using a turboprop aircraft in the British Isles at the time; the F27's scheduled flight time on that route was 2 hours and 45 minutes. Fokker F-27-200 Friendship in 1978 The addition of further Fokker \\"Friendship\\" turboprops to the airline's fleet over the coming years led to the introduction of year-round scheduled services from Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Humberside and Leeds/Bradford to Amsterdam, as well as from Edinburgh via Leeds to Paris Orly and from Aberdeen to Stavanger and Bergen. During the second half of the 1970s Air Anglia also added a pair of Piper PA-31 \\"Navajo Chieftain\\" executive aircraft to its fleet. One of these aircraft was used to launch a new, year round \\"cross-country\\" scheduled service linking the airline's Norwich base with Newquay in Southwest England via Birmingham in the English Midlands and Swansea in Wales. In 1979 Air Anglia launched a year- round scheduled service linking Gatwick with Leeds and extended its domestic year-round scheduled services to Stansted as well. 1979 also saw the introduction of the first jet aircraft into Air Anglia's fleet, when the airline inaugurated daily, year-round scheduled jet operations between Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Amsterdam as well as between Aberdeen, Newcastle and Paris, and Edinburgh, Leeds and Paris with a pair of brand-new Fokker F28 Fellowship 4000 series aircraft.\\"Air Anglia introduces its first F.28-4000\\", Flight International, 2 June 1979, p. 1794\\"Short hauls ... Air Anglia ...\\", Flight International, 28 July 1979, p. 247\\"Britain's first F.28 in service\\" Flight International, 26 August 1978, p. 603 At the time of Air Anglia's merger with BIA, Air Wales and Air Westward to form Air UK in January 1980 its core fleet consisted of two Fokker F28 \\"Fellowship\\" jets and ten Fokker F27 \\"Friendship\\" turboprops. This core fleet was supplemented with additional turboprop capacity temporarily leased in from other operators such as British Midland during the annual summer peak travelling season, as well as during periods when its own fleet was undergoing maintenance. Air Anglia hoped that the merger with BIA as well as Air Wales and Air Westward to form Air UK would help improve the merged entity's competitive position vis-√†-vis its rivals by giving it a bigger network covering all parts of the UK, which would result from combining Air Anglia's year-round scheduled services linking important oil and gas industry centres in the Eastern half of Britain with BIA's scheduled operations across the Western half of the British Isles. This, in turn, would result in a significant marketing advantage over its rivals. Air Anglia also hoped that this would ultimately translate into a better financial performance as well by enabling the new airline to take advantage of the resulting greater economies of scale, which would permit it to spread its fixed costs over a greater level of activity. In addition, Air Anglia's amalgamation with BIA, a wholly owned subsidiary of British and Commonwealth (B&C;), presented an opportunity for Norwich Union to sell its shareholding in Air Anglia to B&C.; ==Incidents and accidents== There were no recorded accidents or incidents during Air Anglia's ten-year existence from 1970 until 1980. ==Aircraft operated== Fokker F28 at Jersey Airport in 1979 Air Anglia operated the following aircraft types at one point or another during its ten- year existence: *Armstrong Whitworth Argosy on season hire from Airbridge Carriers. *Britten-Norman BN-2A Islander *Cessna 172 *Cessna 404 *Douglas DC-3 *Embraer EMB-110 Bandeirante *Fokker F27 Friendship 100/200 series *Fokker F28 Fellowship 1000/4000 series *Handley Page Herald *Piper PA-23 Aztec *Piper PA-31 Navajo Chieftain *Piper PA-30 Twin Comanche. ==Notes and citations== ;Notes ;Citations ==References== * (World Airline Directory, 1970-1980) * ==External links== Category:Defunct airlines of the United Kingdom Category:1970 establishments in England Category:1980 disestablishments in England Category:Airlines established in 1970 Category:Airlines disestablished in 1980 ","title":"Air Anglia"},{"id":"12363369","text":"Gary Kirby (born 12 January 1967 in Patrickswell, County Limerick, Ireland) is an Irish hurling manager and former player. He was named in a list of the \\"125 greatest stars of the GAA\\" in 2009, in which he was described as \\"one of the best players never to win an All-Ireland senior medal\\". As a centre-forward, his playing career at club level was with Patrickswell and at inter-county level with Limerick. He was a key member of the latter team during the resurgence of the 1990s and collected two Munster titles, two National Hurling League titles and four All-Star awards. In retirement from playing Kirby has become involved in team management at all levels. He was a selector with the Limerick senior hurling team under Richie Bennis from 2006 until 2008, a period which saw Limerick qualify for the All-Ireland final in 2007. While Kirby has been touted as a possible future manager of Limerick, he has been in charge of the Patrickswell senior hurling team since 2008. ==Playing career== Club Kirby played his club hurling with the famous Patrickswell team and enjoyed much success in a club career that spanned three decades. He first came to prominence on the club scene as a seventeen-year-old in 1984, when he starred on both the club's minor and senior teams. Furthermore, Kirby collected a minor county title while a defeat of Cappamore gave him his very first senior county championship winners' medal. Three years later Kirby was a key member of the forwards as rivals Ballybrown provided the opposition in another county championship decider. 'The Well' narrowly took the title by 1-17 to 3-10 and Kirby collected his second winners' medal. In 1988 Patrickswell contested the county championship decider for the second consecutive year. Cappamore provided the opposition; however, Patrickswell triumphed by ten points and Kirby added a third county title to his collection. Patrickswell later represented the county in the provincial series of games and even reached the final. The famous Mount Sion club provided the opposition; however, Patrickswell won by 3-13 to 2-13 and Kirby collected a Munster club winners' medal. Patrickswell's run of success came to an end in the All-Ireland semi-final when the O'Donovan Rossa GAC Belfast club defeated the Munster champions by a single point. Patrickswell failed to make it three- in-a-row in 1989; however, the team bounced back the following year to defeat Adare and give Kirby a fourth county championship title. He later added a second Munster club title to his collection following a triumph over √âire √ìg; however, he was back on the team for the All-Ireland final against Glenmore. The game was an exciting one; however, Patrickswell only held the lead on one occasion when Leonard Enright opened the scoring. A 1-13 to 0-12 score line gave Glenmore the title. The next decade saw Patrickswell become the dominant force in club hurling in Limerick. Kirby won his fifth county championship title in 1993. He added to his haul of medals as Patrickswell won three county championships in-a-row in 1995, 1996 and 1997. This latter win was subsequently followed by another Munster final appearance. Clarecastle provided the opposition and eventually won the game by two points. Four-in-a- row proved beyond Patrickswell; however, in 2000 a one-point defeat of Doon gave Kirby a ninth county championship winners' medal. Defeat in 2001 was followed by a tenth county championship success for Kirby in 2003 when Adare were accounted for by two points. Patrickswell subsequently qualified for the Munster final; however, Cork champions Newtwonshandrum recorded a 2-18 to 2-9 victory. Following nearly twenty years of service to Patrickswell, Kirby announced his retirement from club hurling in June 2004. Minor & under-21 Kirby first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Limerick minor hurling team in the early 1980s. After losing nine provincial deciders since their last success in 1965, Kirby's minor team went into the 1984 unster final as underdogs. Tipperary, the team that had beaten Limerick in the two previous deciders, provided the opposition once again. At the long whistle Limerick were the champions by 3-6 to 2-7 and Kirby collected a Munster minor winners' medal. Limerick later qualified for the All-Ireland final with Kilkenny providing the opposition. It was the very first meeting between these two sides in the minor championship. An exciting game developed, however, at the full-time whistle both sides were level and a replay was required. The second encounter between the two sides was a low- scoring tense affair; however, Limerick narrowly triumphed by 2-5 to 2-4 and Kirby collected an All-Ireland minor winners' medal. Two years later Kirby was a key member of the Limerick under-21 hurling team. A Munster final appearance beckoned with near neighbours Clare providing the opposition. A close game developed and, at the end, both sides were level with 3-9 apiece. The subsequent replay was something akin to a walkover for Limerick. A 2-10 to 0-3 score line gave Limerick the win and gave Kirby a Munster winners' medal in the under-21 grade. Limerick, however, were later beaten in the All-Ireland semi-final. In 1987 Limerick reached the provincial under-21 decider for a second successive year. Cork were the opponents on that occasion; however, Kirby collected a second Munster under-21 title following a 3-14 to 2-9 victory. An appearance in the All-Ireland final soon followed with reigning champions Galwayproviding the opposition. Limerick, however, proved unstoppable and powered to a 2-15 to 3-6 victory and an All-Ireland winners' medal. Senior Kirby made his senior championship debut for Limerick in 1987 at a time when the county team was in the doldrums. His first few seasons on the team ended with an early exit from the provincial championship, however, even though Limerick weren't enjoying much success Kirby was presented with his first All-Star award in 1991. In 1992 Kirby's side qualified for the final of the National Hurling League. Reigning All-Ireland champions Tipperary provided the opposition and took an eight-point lead at half-time. Limerick battled back to claim a narrow 0-14 to 0-13 victory and Kirby collected his first National League winners' medal. The new league champions built on this momentum and subsequently qualified for a Munster final showdown with Cork. A high-scoring game developed; however, at the long whistle Cork were the champions by 1-22 to 3-11. Limerick failed to reach the provincial decider the following year; however, in 1994 Kirby was captain as the team bounced back and qualified for the Munster final again. Provincial whipping boys Clare were the opponents and a rout took place. A 0-25 to 2-10 score line gave Limerick the win and gave Kirby his first Munster winners' medal. Limerick subsequently qualified to meet Offaly in the All-Ireland final. It looked as if Kirby's side were going to make history and claim the title as they had a five-point lead with as many minutes left. Offaly suddenly sprang to life following a Johnny Dooley goal from a close-in free. Following the puck-out Offaly worked the ball upfield and Pat O'Connor struck for a second goal. The Offaly forwards scored another five unanswered points in the time remaining to secure a 3-16 to 2-13 victory. It was a bitter blow for Limerick who looked as if they had one hand on the Liam MacCarthy Cup. In spite of the defeat Kirby was later presented with a second All-Star award. Limerick surrendered their Munster title to Clare in 1995; however, Kirby picked up a third All-Star. The men from the Treaty county faced Tipperary in the provincial final the following year. All did not go to plan and looked to be heading out of the championship as Tipp took a ten-point lead. Kirby's side battled back to secure a 0-19 to 1-16 draw and a second chance to defeat their near rivals. The replay also saw Tipperary take a decisive lead; however, Limerick's goal-scoring ability was the deciding factor. A 4-7 to 0-16 score line gave Limerick the title and gave Kirby a second Munster winners' medal. The subsequent All-Ireland final pitted Limerick against Wexford for the first time in over forty years. The game was far from a classic; however, it did provide excitement. Tom Dempsey was the hero of the day as he scored a goal after nineteen minutes to give Wexford a major advantage. His side led by 1-8 to 0-10 at half-time in spite of having √âamonn Scallan sent off. Wexford took a four-point lead in the second-half; however, this was whittled back to two points as Wexford hung on for the last twenty minutes. The final score of 1-13 to 0-14 showed how vital Dempsey‚Äôs goal was. It was Limerick's second All- Ireland defeat in two years. Once again Kirby's individual skill was recognised when he collected his fourth All-Star award. In 1997 Limerick defeated Galway by 1-12 to 1-9 to take the National League title. It was Kirby's second winners' medal in that competition. The recent All-Ireland defeats, however, seemed to have damaged the team as Limerick crashed out of the provincial championship at an early stage. This process repeated itself over the next few years. Following Limerick's exit from the championship in 1999 Kirby decided to retire from inter-county hurling.

He first lined out for his province in 1991 as Munster faced Connacht in the decider. That game ended in defeat for Kirby's side as the westerners won by 4-16 to 3-17. After being omitted from the team for three years, Kirby was back on the team in 1994; however, Munster were defeated in the opening game. He was appointed captain in 1995 as the southerners qualified for the final. Ulster provided the opposition; however, Munster scraped a win by 0-13 to 1-9 and Kirby collected a Railway Cup winners' medal. It was the beginning of a successful era for the province as Munster retained the title in 1996 with Kirby winning a second Railway Cup title in his last Railway Cup appearance. ==Management career== Limerick In 2006 Limerick manager Joe McKenna suddenly resigned following the county's exit from the provincial championship. Richie Bennis was appointed manager on an interim basis while Kirby joined the management team as a selector. While Limerick hurling was at a low ebb the team still qualified for an All-Ireland quarter- final meeting with reigning All-Ireland champions Cork. A close game developed; however, at the full-time whistle Limerick lost out by a single point. Bennis and his selection team remained in charge of Limerick again for the 2007 season, a season which turned out to be one of Limerick's best in many years. After a remarkable three-game sage with Tipperary in the Munster semi-final, the Treaty county qualified for their first provincial decider since 2001. Waterford provided the opposition; however, they were defeated on a score line of 3-17 to 1-14. These two sides later met again in the All- Ireland semi-final; however, the management and players masterminded a magnificent 5-11 to 2-15 victory over the Munster champions. This victory allowed Limerick to play Kilkenny in the championship decider. Unfortunately, Limerick got off to a bad start with goalkeeper Brian Murray letting in two goals by Eddie Brennan and Henry Shefflin in the first ten minutes. Limerick fought back; however 'the Cats' went on to win the game by seven points. In 2008 Limerick failed to build on the relative success of the previous season. The team were beaten by 4-12 to 1-16 in opening game of the championship by Clare. The newly structured qualifier system pitted Limerick against Offaly in a must-win game. Limerick, however, were out of sorts as they suffered a surprising 3-19 to 0-18 defeat and were dumped out of the championship. Following this defeat the management team's term in charge ended and, while there was some speculation that Kirby would succeed Richie Bennis as manager, the position went to Justin McCarthy instead. Patrickswell In December 2008 Kirby was appointed manager of the Patrickswell senior hurling team. ==Career statistics== {  - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Team !rowspan=\\"2\\"Year !colspan=\\"3\\"National League !colspan=\\"2\\"Munster !colspan=\\"2\\"All-Ireland !colspan=\\"2\\"Total - !Division!!Apps!!Score!!Apps!!Score!!Apps!!Score!!Apps!!Score - rowspan=\\"13\\"Limerick 1986-87 rowspan=\\"5\\"Division 1 85-0931-01colspan=2‚Äî116-10 - 1987-88 82-3820-07colspan=2‚Äî102-45 - 1988-89 62-3521-10colspan=2‚Äî83-45 - 1989-90 74-3520-15colspan=2‚Äî94-50 - 1990-91 20-0820-15colspan=2‚Äî40-23 - 1991-92 rowspan=\\"2\\"Division 1A 74-3822-12colspan=2‚Äî96-50 - 1992-93 85-3210-03colspan=2‚Äî95-35 - 1993-94 rowspan=\\"2\\"Division 1 71-2333-2121-12125-56 - 1994-95 61-2620-18colspan=2‚Äî81-44 - 1995-96 rowspan=\\"1\\"Division 2 41-2841-2420-11102-63 - 1997 rowspan=\\"3\\"Division 1A 74-3220-10colspan=2‚Äî94-42 - 1998 53-1910-02colspan=2‚Äî63-21 - 1999 10-0010-04colspan=2‚Äî20-04 - !colspan=\\"3\\"Total 7632-323278-14241-2310741-488 } ==References== Category:1967 births Category:Living people Category:Patrickswell hurlers Category:Limerick inter-county hurlers Category:Munster inter-provincial hurlers Category:Hurling managers Category:Hurling selectors ","title":"Gary Kirby"},{"id":"12363395","text":"Petkim Petrokimya Holding A.≈û. is the leading petrochemical company of Turkey.

It is the sequel to the 1953 cartoon Duck Dodgers in the 24¬Ωth Century. It was the first Daffy and Porky cartoon since 1965. This cartoon first premiered on November 20, 1980, as part of an animated CBS television special called Daffy Duck's Thanks-for-Giving Special, with scenes that would later be cut when this cartoon was reformatted as a short. The theme tune is an orchestral version of Fr√©d√©ric Chopin - Polonaise in A major Op. 40 No. 1 Military. ==Plot== Daffy Duck reprises his famous role of Duck Dodgers in another spoof of Saturday afternoon space serials. Assigned to locate the rack-and-pinion molecule needed for yo-yo polish, Dodgers and his sidekick, an eager young space cadet (Porky Pig), crash their spaceship into a giant eggshell-shaped planet, where they find Marvin the Martian, who is, as usual, scheming to destroy Earth in an attempt to solve the \\"fuel problem\\". Marvin asks Dodgers to visit the boudoir of Gossamer, which Dodgers thinks is a space princess, but Gossamer turns out to be a giant, hairy monster in sneakers, and the frightened Dodgers flees. Porky uses electronic clippers to literally haircut Gossamer into nothingness, and Dodgers, infuriated by his assistant's all-too-literal interpretations of his commands, repeatedly fires his gun at Porky. When Porky asks what Earth will do without the rack-and-pinion molecule Dodgers replies \\"Let them eat cake.\\" ==Cast== ‚Ä¢ Mel Blanc as Daffy Duck (as Duck Dodgers), Porky Pig, Marvin the Martian, Gossamer and Dr. I.Q. ==Changes in the reformatted version== * The following scenes were cut when this cartoon was reformatted as an individual animated short: ** Dodgers telling Marvin he is under arrest. ** Porky using a straitjacket gun to capture Marvin the Martian. ** The real ending where Marvin (still wrapped in the straitjacket) aims his missile at Earth and fires it, then tells the viewers that the missile will take three days to reach Earth, giving everyone time to get their affairs in order before getting killed (which explains the \\"That's All Folks!\\" ending card where Marvin the Martian says, \\"Don't worry, folks. After all, it's only a cartoon.\\"). * The Nickelodeon version of this cartoon cuts out the \\"That's All Folks!\\" ending card where Marvin the Martian says, \\"Don't worry, folks. After all, it's only a cartoon,\\" along with the edits made to it when it was reformatted as a cartoon short. * The edited version of this cartoon has also been seen on ABC, Cartoon Network, and even in such home video releases as Marvin the Martian and K-9: 50 Years on Earth VHS, Marvin the Martian: Space Tunes VHS, the Bugs and Friends Japanese laserdisc set, the DVD release of Daffy Duck's Quackbusters and the Looney Tunes Platinum Collection: Volume 1 Blu-Ray set.

The parish is on the county boundary with Hampshire and is close to the New Forest; it includes the villages of Wick and Charlton-All-Saints, and the small ancient settlement of Witherington. The Trafalgar Park estate erased the former settlement of Standlynch. The parish church, Trafalgar House and two more houses are Grade I listed. Downton village is on the east bank of the river. Wick lies on the opposite bank, and is linked to Charlton by the A338 Poole-Oxfordshire road which accompanies the river north-south through the parish. ==History== Downton can trace its ancient inhabitants to the Neolithic, Iron Age, Roman and Saxon times. Evidence of Neolithic occupation was found at Downton in 1956-7 in advance of a housing development. Close to this site, in 1953 the site of a Roman villa was discovered. Excavations in 1955-6 revealed a villa with tessellated floors, at least two featuring mosaics, a hypocaust and bath house. Roman features were found over an area of about 12 acres. The villa is no longer visible, but the finds, including one of the mosaics, are displayed in Salisbury Museum. Clearbury Ring, on high ground in the northwest of the parish, is an Iron Age hillfort. The ancient parish of Downton covered a large area, extending north to Nunton and southeast beyond Redlynch as far as Hamptworth. Downton was probably the principal village in the 7th and 8th centuries, and became important as the centre of the manor belonging to the Bishop of Winchester. The Domesday Book of 1068 recorded a large settlement of 131 households at Downton. Henry of Blois, Bishop of Winchester, built a (possibly incomplete) motte-and-bailey castle near the river. Moot House (or The Moot) was built c. 1700 just to the east; the castle site, of some became the gardens of the house c. 1720. Today the house is a Grade I listed building while the gardens are owned and managed by a preservation trust and are open to the public. Sarum Morris perform at the 2006 Cuckoo Fair in Downton The Manor House, northwest of the parish church, is a Grade I listed hall house with attached chapel from the 14th century, altered in the 17th and 19th. The house and church were an endowment to Winchester College by William of Wykeham in 1380; the house was later leased by Elizabeth I, and was occupied by a brother of Sir Walter Raleigh in the 17th century. The manor house at Standlynch was built in 1733 for Sir Peter Vandeput and extended in 1766 by Henry Dawkins, plantation owner and Member of Parliament. In 1814 the nation bought the estate and gave it to Lord Nelson's heirs, who changed its name to Trafalgar Park, to commemorate Nelson's victory at the Battle of Trafalgar. The artist John Constable visited Downton in 1820, and his sketch of the Avon with the church in the background is held in the British Museum. In 1836, a time of continued agricultural hardship, the parish sponsored an emigration of more than 200 of its poor people to Upper Canada for opportunities there; they sailed in April 1836 on the ship King William. From 1880 to 1906 John Wrightson, a pioneer in agricultural education, had his Downton Agricultural College here.Carrie de Silva, A Short History of Agricultural Education and Research, Harper Adams University, (2015) pp96-97 The Salisbury and Dorset Junction Railway, linking Salisbury with the line to Poole and Bournemouth, was built north-south across the parish and opened in 1866. Its route passed close to the east of Downton village, with Downton station reached from Lode Hill. The line was absorbed into the LSWR in 1883. It was closed in 1964 and the track was lifted the following year. Nunton (with Bodenham) and Standlynch became civil parishes in the 19th century, then as the population grew and churches were built, Downton was reduced in size. In 1896 its eastern part became Redlynch civil parish, in 1897 Charlton and Witherington were united with Standlynch to form the civil parish of Standlynch with Charlton All Saints, and in 1923 Morgan's Vale and Woodfalls were taken to form a new civil parish. Finally, in 1934 Standlynch and Charlton were reunited with Downton, and Morgan's Vale and Woodfalls were added to Redlynch. For about a decade from around 1961, Downton had an important part to play in British motorsport. Its Downton Engineering Works produced some of the motors used by racing cars. Housebuilding in the 20th and 21st centuries has developed the Wick area into a western extension of Downton village. In 1999 a community project, The Downton Millennial Book Fund, published an illustrated history of the village from its ancient days.Waymouth 1999, p. 186 == Religious sites ==  Parish church  St Laurence's Church The Church of England parish church of St Laurence has its origins in the 12th century, and Pevsner describes it as \\"a large and interesting church\\". The nave is the oldest surviving work; the transepts are from the 13th century and the chancel from the 14th. Restoration was carried out in the 17th century, then in 1812 by D.A. Alexander and in 1860 by T.H. Wyatt. The tower had its upper part rebuilt in the 17th century and has eight bells, one of which is from the 14th century and two from the 17th. Downton ecclesiastical parish was large, with dependant medieval churches at Nunton, Standlynch and Witherington; there were no churches at Morgan's Vale, Redlynch or Charlton until the 19th century. The church was designated as Grade I listed in 1960, and today forms part of the Forest and Avon team ministry, a grouping of six churches in Wiltshire and Hampshire.  Other Downton churches  There were Baptists in Downton from the 17th century. A congregation of Particular Baptists formed c. 1738 and built a chapel at South Lane in 1791, which was replaced by a larger building on the same site in 1857. This continues as Downton Baptist Church. A Methodist chapel was built in 1896 on Downton High Street, replacing an earlier chapel at Lode Hill. The building continues in use as Downton Methodist Church. A Roman Catholic chapel of the Good Shepherd was founded in 1914 at Barford Lane, at the northern edge of Downton, on land given by the Nelsons. The present building was built in 1950 and is served from Salisbury.  Elsewhere in the parish  Charlton has an Anglican church, All Saints', built in 1851 partly at the expense of Lord Nelson. Construction is in brick to designs of T.H. Wyatt, in Early English style. Today the church is part of the Chalke Valley benefice. At Standlynch a small church near the river, dedicated to St Mary, was probably founded in 1147. It was rebuilt in 1677 and became a private chapel for Standlynch manor and later for the Nelsons of Trafalgar Park; the building was restored by William Butterfield in 1859-66. The dedication was changed to St Michael and All Angels, probably in 1914, and the church has been closed since 1947. A church stood at Witherington in 1147 but fell into disuse in the 15th century. A Wesleyan Methodist chapel was built near All Saints' church in 1864, and became a private house in the 1970s. ==Geography== The River Avon flows through Downton, and is the source of occasional flooding in the village. Major flood defence work was carried out in 2002 after a big flood. The watermeadows, fields through which irrigation channels were made using weirs and channelling, use the water from this river. ==Governance== Downton has a fifteen-member parish council with responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, Wiltshire Council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with Wiltshire Council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The parish council is divided into two wards: Downton, which elects fourteen councillors, and Charlton-All-Saints, which elects one councillor. Along with the neighbouring parishes of Odstock, Britford and Coombe Bissett, Downton parish is part of the ward of Downton & Ebble Valley in the unitary authority of Wiltshire Council, which has the wider responsibility for providing services such as education, refuse collection, and tourism. The ward is currently represented by Julian Johnson, a member of the Conservative Party. It is also part of the Salisbury parliamentary constituency, represented by John Glen, also a Conservative, and is part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament. From 1295 to 1832, Downton was a parliamentary borough, giving eligible residents the right to elect two MPs to Parliament. Notable MPs include Blessed John Story, an English Roman Catholic martyr, later beatified by Pope Leo XIII; Sir Carew Raleigh, elder brother of Sir Walter Raleigh; Robert 'Bonnie Bobby Shafto', the subject of a popular folk song; and the poet Robert Southey, who was elected without his knowledge and declined to take his seat. ==Economy== Until the 20th century, the primary economic activity of the village had been agriculture and related crafts. For instance, in the early 1900s, craftsmen still maintained reed beds in the river for their materials to make baskets and furniture. Tanning was an important industry, with a tannery recorded as existing in the village in the 16th century. A new tannery, which became Downton Tanning Company Ltd, was built in the early 19th century, making leather for harnesses and saddles until it closed in 1998;Waymouth 1999, p. 121 its building has been converted into housing and retirement homes. Downton Business Centre, on the A338, is home to a variety of businesses including Hop Back Brewery, Revive Vending, Sytec, and Help for Heroes Trading. Hop Back first brewed its beer in 1986 at the Wyndham Arms in Salisbury, and six years later, moved to larger premises in Downton. As of 2010, Hop Back owned eleven public houses around the south of England. Nearby is the smaller Downton Brewery, established in 2003. Help for Heroes is a charity that raises money to supplement existing government provision for injured members of the British armed forces. ==Transport== The busy A338 Bournemouth to Oxfordshire road runs through the western side of the village. The village's main street, forming The Borough, High Street and Lode Hill, has been designated as the B3080 road to the New Forest. The Wilts & Dorset bus company runs its X3 route along the A338 on the western side of the village, with a half-hourly service north to Salisbury and south to Bournemouth. It also runs the more local routes 40 and 44 through the main part of village. ==Amenities== Downton has a village hall (the Memorial Hall) and three pubs: the Bull Hotel, The Goat and the Wooden Spoon. Downton Leisure Centre (owned by the Brian Whitehead Sports Centre Association), in the eastern outskirts of Wick, provides sports and social facilities. It is the home of Downton F.C., who play in the Wessex Football League. Downton holds an annual village f√™te called the Cuckoo Fair on the Saturday nearest May Day. Originally a country fair where livestock would be traded and agricultural workers would seek employment, the fair was abandoned after the First World War. It was revived in its modern form in 1980 by Peter Waddington MBE.Waymouth 1999, p. 179 The origin of the name is unknown. The Avon Valley Path passes through Charlton, then crosses the river at Downton before turning southeast towards Hampshire. Prior to its connection to the national grid, Downton was supplied with electricity from a small local power station operated by the Central Electricity Generating Board. In 1958 the station comprised a 35 kW water turbine driven by the River Avon and an 82 kW diesel engine plant. Electricity was available to consumers at 400‚Äì420 Volts alternating current. In 1958 the station supplied 215 MWh of electricity; in 1972 supplies were 287 MWh. The power station was decommissioned in the mid-1970s. ==Education== Downton has a primary school and a secondary school. Downton CofE (VA) Primary School dates from 1895, when it replaced older schools. Children of all ages attended until the secondary school opened. The Trafalgar School at Downton (for ages 11‚Äì16) opened at Wick in 1964, at first as a secondary modern, then becoming a comprehensive called Downton School in the early 1970s. The school was renamed in 2005 to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Trafalgar. ==ReferencesSourcesExternal links== *Downton community website by the Downton Society *Downton Parish Council *Images from the Downton group on Flickr Category:Villages in Wiltshire Category:Civil parishes in Wiltshire ","title":"Downton, Wiltshire"},{"id":"12363456","text":"Douglas Steven Volmar (January 9, 1945 ‚Äì June 18, 2017) was an American ice hockey forward who appeared in a total of 62 National Hockey League regular season games with the Detroit Red Wings and Los Angeles Kings in 1970‚Äì73.

Modern tradition strongly links league and championship ranking together; winning a respective championship also gets you promoted in the league regardless of where you finish in the latter, while the league can see your championship status being upgraded or downgraded. Competitions in Tyrone are organized in the following manner. == Senior == Regardless of wherever a team plays in the county Senior, Intermediate or Junior football championship, the main or first team in all clubs are regarded as the senior team. There are current 49 teams from 48 clubs competing in this grade (Errigal Ciar√°n have a third team that competes in Division 3). In the 2007 season the All-county league (ACL) is split into four divisions of 12 teams each except for Division 3 which has 13 teams. The divisions in ranking order, with the highest one first, are Division 1A, Division 1B, Division 2 and Division 3. Teams that compete in Divisions 1A & 1B compete in the Senior Championship, Division 2 teams compete in the Intermediate Championship and Division 3 teams play for the Junior Championship. Each team plays each other on a double round-robin, giving sides 22 league games or 24 in Division 3. From 2008 the ACL will be split into three divisions, with the finishing places from the 2007 league determining which of the three divisions each team will play in. Divisions 1 & 2 will each have 16 teams with the remainder in Division 3. The league will be played on a single round basis giving teams 15 games a season. The Senior, Intermediate and Junior Championships are all played on a straight knockout-basis, usually commencing in May and finishing in September or October. == Reserve == All clubs, except Errigal Ciaran's third team, have a corresponding reserve team that acts as a second string below their senior team. These teams compete in the same divisions as their senior team, with most matches taking place on the same day before the corresponding senior fixture. The Reserve Championships take place in a similar fashion to their senior teams, though they are called instead the Division 1, Division 2 and Division 3 Reserve Championships. There is no promotion or relegation between reserve leagues, it is dependent on how successful their senior team does in the same year. Therefore, unlike their corresponding senior team, it is possible for a reserve team to retain a league or championship title in Divisions 2 or 3, and the league in Division 1B. == Under 21 == The Under 21 Championship commenced in 1975 was for some two and a half decades an open straight knockout competition between all clubs that entered. 2000 saw the introduction of a Grade 2 championship and 2004 seen the introduction of group stages before progressing on to knockout rounds. The competition usually starts in July. However fixture congestion and worries of player burnout at this age level have seen some clubs either not enter at this age level or they withdraw during the competition. == Minor == Minor competitions are for players under 18 years of age. All competing teams are split into three different grades, usually 16 in grades 1 and 2 with the remainder in grade 3. The terms \\"grades\\" for youth football are a term near exclusive to Tyrone, with other counties often using the term \\"divisions\\". Also all youth football is played on an All-county basis, and not on a divisional or local basis like some other counties. In the Minor football leagues, each grade is split into two sections of normally 8 teams. This split in not at random, it is done by geography, with one section comprising the eight more westerly teams in the grade with the other section comprising the eight more easterly teams with rare exceptions. This geographical split does not have a fixed line and depends on the competing teams in each grade. While teams from places like Strabane and Omagh will almost always compete in a section for western-based teams and Cookstown and Coalisland in an eastern section, teams from around the centre of the county could end up in either. Indeed, if a grade has teams which has many more from one part of the county than the other, some teams may end up playing in a section with different teams than usual. E.G. a grade which has a lot of East Tyrone teams might see clubs like Killeeshil and Pomeroy play in the western section, while a grade with a lot of West Tyrone teams might see Beragh or Fintona play in the eastern section. In the league each team plays each other once, seven games in total, with the top four in each section going forward to the quarter finals which are then played on a straight knockout basis. The championship follows the same grades as those of the league and is played on a straight knockout basis. The draw is open with no restrictions on geography. The Minor Grade 1 Football Championship final is traditionally played as a curtain raiser to the Senior Football Championship Final. Minor competitions usually start in late March, normally with a break in June for exams by which time league games pre- quarter final will normally have been completed. Games played in Grades 1 and 2 are with 15-a-side teams while those in Grade 3 are played 13-a-side. == Under 16 & Under 14 == Both Under 16 and Under 14 competitions follow the same format, similar to that of minor competitions. In the league, competitions are split into four grades of normally 12 teams each (before 2005 they were split into three as for minor competitions). Each grade is then split into two sections of six in a similar fashion to that for the minor league. Each team plays each other home and away, giving 10 games and the top four qualify for the league quarter finals. The championships are also run on a straight open knockout basis. A team winning a league or championship title at under 14 level will be \\"promoted\\" while a team that finishes bottom of their section would be \\"relegated\\" when it comes to Under 16 competitions in two years time. E.g. a team that wins the under 14 grade 4 championship in 2007 will play in grade 3 at Under 16 level in 2009. The rules for this are not rigid however, and clubs may ask to be placed in a certain grade before they are drawn up for the year. However the final decision lies with the county youth committee whose job it is to ensure that each grade is competitive for all teams involved. Under 16 promotion/relegation can work in a similar fashion for minor football, but is a little more complicated because of the different number of grades. Games played in Grades 1 & 2 are played 15-a-side while those in Grade 3 & 4 are played 13-a-side. Under 16 competitions are played with a size 5 football while Under 14 games are played with a size 4 football. The Under 14 competitions usually start in March while Under 16 competition starts in late June/early July. Unlike other counties, Juvenile competitions in Tyrone often refer only to Under 16 competitions and not all levels under minor. == Under 13 == Over the last number of years a small autumn Under 13 based league has taken place in Tyrone. Its original purpose was to find a county winner for the Feile na n√ìg competition but has since evolved into its own competition with 4 different grades. In 2006 Grade 1 was played with teams 15-a-side, Grade 2 13-a-side, while Grades 3 & 4 were played 11 and 9-a-side respectively on shortened playing areas. Only a league takes place, there is no championship competition. == Under 12 == Since the early 1990s Under 12 football has been played on a non-competitive basis, with teams arranged into local groups to play each other in a round-robin. The emphasis is on player and team development rather than winning, and as such no trophies or medals are awarded by the county board. In 2005 the league has been run on the Go- Games principles with rules different from those normally, smaller teams and shortened pitches. == Under 10 and Under 8 == Competitions at these age levels are held as blitzes usually around once a month at each age level. Like Under 12 competitions the Go-Games principles apply for each age level. E.G. Under 8 games are played under \\"First Touch\\" rules which doesn't allow for deliberate physical contact and is only allowed to bounce the ball once in a solo run.

After his retirement he set up ≈åshima stable which he ran from 1980 until he left the Japan Sumo Association in 2012 upon reaching the age of 65. ==Career== Born in Aibetsu, Kamikawa District, Asahikuni made his professional debut in July 1963, joining Tatsunami stable. He reached the second highest j≈´ry≈ç division in March 1969 and the top makuuchi division just two tournaments after that. In 1970 he dropped to j≈´ry≈ç once again but he returned to the top division in 1972, reaching sekiwake in November. At the beginning of 1976 Asahikuni put together two strong records of 12‚Äì3 and 13-2, finishing as runner-up in both tournaments, and this earned him promotion to the rank of ≈çzeki. It had taken him 77 tournaments from his professional debut to reach ≈çzeki, which at the time was the slowest ever. His best tournament result came in July 1977 when he lost just one bout, but he finished as runner-up to Kitanoumi who won with a perfect record. Asahikuni was never able to win a top division championship, this being his fourth and final runner-up performance. He retired in September 1979 after 21 tournaments as an ≈çzeki. His retirement was enforced, as he had broken his shoulder in a bout with Mienoumi. The two wrestlers had been friends as well as rivals, having made their professional debuts in the same month, and their friendship survived the incident. ==Fighting style== Asahikuni was an extremely skilful wrestler, earning the nickname \\"the PhD of sumo\\", such was his knowledge of a wide variety of techniques. He won the prestigious Gin≈ç-sh≈ç, or Technique prize, on six occasions. He achieved this despite the fact that he suffered regularly from pancreatitis and was known even to commute to tournaments from hospital. He specialised in a left hand outside, right hand inside grip on his opponent's mawashi, migi-yotsu, from which he regularly won by shitatenage, or underarm throw. He was also one of very few wrestlers to use tottari, or arm pull. ==Retirement from sumo== Asahikuni stayed in the sumo world as an elder under the name of ≈åshima Oyakata. In 1980 he established ≈åshima stable, despite strong opposition from his old stable boss Tatsunami, who did not want him to break away from the stable even though Asahikuni did not take any high ranking wrestlers with him. ≈åshima stable eventually produced Asahifuji, who reached the yokozuna rank in 1990, and in 1992 ≈åshima became the first stablemaster to recruit Mongolians, with six joining for the March 1992 tournament. Two of them, Kyokush≈´zan and Kyokutenh≈ç, reached the top division, rising to komusubi and sekiwake respectively. In all ≈åshima produced ten sekitori, including komusubi Kyokudozan and Asahiyutaka. He also worked as a judge of tournament bouts and was on the Japan Sumo Association's board of directors until 2010 when he lost an election to Takanohana. Upon reaching the mandatory retirement age of 65 in April 2012 ≈åshima stable was dissolved with its wrestlers moving to Tomozuna stable. Kyokutenh≈ç, who had once been considered a future head of ≈åshima stable, instead became head of Tomozuna stable in 2017. ==Family== Asahikuni has two sons, both of whom joined his stable, but neither reached the elite sekitori ranks. His eldest, Tom≈ç, born in 1978, joined in 1994 and was known as Kyokuhoten. He retired in November 1999 after a long injury layoff, with a highest rank of sandanme 26. His younger son Kunihiro, born in 1979, made his debut in 1995 and fought under the similar ring name of Kyokushoten. He had a much longer and marginally more successful career, reaching a highest rank of makushita 46 before retiring in January 2011. ==Career recordSee also== *Glossary of sumo terms *List of sumo tournament top division runners-up *List of sumo tournament second division champions *List of past sumo wrestlers *List of ≈çzeki ==ReferencesExternal links== * Oshima beya guide Category:1947 births Category:Living people Category:Japanese sumo wrestlers Category:≈åzeki Category:Sumo people from Hokkaido ","title":"Asahikuni Masuo"},{"id":"12363467","text":"J-Melo is a weekly Japanese music television program broadcast by NHK.

Most of the time, guest greetings are recorded on video to thank their supporters from outside Japan. There are also some episodes where the guests will sit down on set for an interview and sometimes, a performance. The theme for these shows will usually be the works of the guest musician. These appearances are rather significant, as the show is primarily recorded for foreign viewers. Interviews and messages are also subtitled in English whenever needed.  Notable Guests  The following are notable guests who appeared in the show. Those with dates in light blue are guests who appeared on set, while those in light yellow are guests who appeared on video. { width=100% - valign =\\"top\\" width=50%  2006  {  ! style=\\"width: 80%\\"  Title ! style=\\"width: 20%\\"  Date - - bgcolor=\\"#F0F8FF\\" !align=\\"left\\"Bonnie Pink align=\\"left\\"July 2006 - - bgcolor=\\"#F0F8FF\\" !align=\\"left\\"Demon Kogure align=\\"left\\"August 2006 - - bgcolor=\\"#F0F8FF\\" !align=\\"left\\"melody. align=\\"left\\"November 2006 - }  2007  {  ! style=\\"width: 75%\\"  Title ! style=\\"width: 25%\\"  Date - - bgcolor=\\"#F0E68C\\" !align=\\"left\\"Dir en grey align=\\"left\\"March 2007 - - bgcolor=\\"#F0E68C\\" !align=\\"left\\"HIGH and MIGHTY COLOR align=\\"left\\"March 2007 - - bgcolor=\\"#F0E68C\\" !align=\\"left\\"Angela Aki align=\\"left\\"April 2007 - - bgcolor=\\"#F0E68C\\" !align=\\"left\\"Sowelu align=\\"left\\"April 2007 - - bgcolor=\\"#F0F8FF\\" !align=\\"left\\"M-Flo align=\\"left\\"April 2007 - - bgcolor=\\"#F0E68C\\" !align=\\"left\\"Akikawa Masafumi align=\\"left\\"June 2007 December 2007 - - bgcolor=\\"#F0E68C\\" !align=\\"left\\"L'Arc-en-Ciel align=\\"left\\"June 2007 December 2007 - - bgcolor=\\"#F0F8FF\\" !align=\\"left\\"Crystal Kay align=\\"left\\"July 2007 - - bgcolor=\\"#F0F8FF\\" !align=\\"left\\"Nora (Orquesta de la Luz) align=\\"left\\"August 2007 - - bgcolor=\\"#F0E68C\\" !align=\\"left\\"Morning Musume align=\\"left\\"August 2007 - - bgcolor=\\"#F0F8FF\\" !align=\\"left\\"Monkey Majik align=\\"left\\"August 2007 - - bgcolor=\\"#F0F8FF\\" !align=\\"left\\"Terumasa Hino align=\\"left\\"August 2007 - - bgcolor=\\"#F0F8FF\\" !align=\\"left\\"Kazumi Watanabe align=\\"left\\"August 2007 - - bgcolor=\\"#F0F8FF\\" !align=\\"left\\"Emyli align=\\"left\\"August 2007 - - bgcolor=\\"#F0F8FF\\" !align=\\"left\\"Jyongri align=\\"left\\"August 2007 - - bgcolor=\\"#F0F8FF\\" !align=\\"left\\"Akira Jimbo align=\\"left\\"September 2007 - - bgcolor=\\"#F0F8FF\\" !align=\\"left\\"Soichi Muraji align=\\"left\\"September 2007 - - bgcolor=\\"#F0E68C\\" !align=\\"left\\"Kousuke Atari align=\\"left\\"October 2007 - - bgcolor=\\"#F0F8FF\\" !align=\\"left\\"Jesse (RIZE) align=\\"left\\"September 2007 - - bgcolor=\\"#F0F8FF\\" !align=\\"left\\"Makoto Ozone align=\\"left\\"November 2007 - - bgcolor=\\"#F0F8FF\\" !align=\\"left\\"WISE align=\\"left\\"November 2007 - - bgcolor=\\"#F0F8FF\\" !align=\\"left\\"May J. align=\\"left\\"November 2007 - }   2008  {  ! style=\\"width: 75%\\"  Title ! style=\\"width: 25%\\"  Date - - bgcolor=\\"#F0F8FF\\" !align=\\"left\\"Shonen Knife align=\\"left\\"January 2008 - - bgcolor=\\"#F0F8FF\\" !align=\\"left\\"indigo blue align=\\"left\\"January 2008 - - bgcolor=\\"#F0F8FF\\" !align=\\"left\\"Polysics align=\\"left\\"February 2008 - - bgcolor=\\"#F0F8FF\\" !align=\\"left\\"Zeebra align=\\"left\\"February 2008 - - bgcolor=\\"#F0F8FF\\" !align=\\"left\\"Tanaka Roma align=\\"left\\"March 2008 - - bgcolor=\\"#F0F8FF\\" !align=\\"left\\"M-Flo align=\\"left\\"March 2008 April 2008 - - bgcolor=\\"#F0F8FF\\" !align=\\"left\\"Tokyo Ska Paradise Orchestra align=\\"left\\"April 2008 - - bgcolor=\\"#F0F8FF\\" !align=\\"left\\"Hiromi Uehara align=\\"left\\"April 2008 - - bgcolor=\\"#F0F8FF\\" !align=\\"left\\"Miyavi align=\\"left\\"May 2008 - - bgcolor=\\"#F0F8FF\\" !align=\\"left\\"Yasuji Ohagi align=\\"left\\"May 2008 - - bgcolor=\\"#F0E68C\\" !align=\\"left\\"the GazettE align=\\"left\\"May 2008 - - bgcolor=\\"#F0E68C\\" !align=\\"left\\"GO!

Hucul had a long playing career, turning professional in 1954 with the Calgary Stampeders of the Western Hockey League. He would remain with the WHL for almost his entire career (barring a partial season in 1957 with the Buffalo Bisons of the American Hockey League), playing for the Spokane Comets, the Victoria Maple Leafs and for his final five seasons, the Phoenix Roadrunners. He won the Hal Laycoe Cup as the league's best defenceman in 1968 and 1972, after which he retired as a player. Hucul served an interim stint as the Roadrunners' head coach in 1970, and was named the permanent coach after his retirement, also serving as head coach of the WHA Roadrunners from 1974 to 1976 when the team joined the World Hockey Association, winning the Howard Baldwin Trophy as the coach of the year in 1975. After the Roadrunners left the league, he continued as coach for two more seasons in the Central and Pacific minor leagues until the team finally folded after the 1979 season. In the 1980s Hucul survived a bout with rectal cancer and is now enjoying retirement life with his long-time wife Shirley, two daughters and two sons in Phoenix, Arizona. ==Coaching record== {  style=\\"font-size: 95%; text-align:center;\\" - ! rowspan=\\"2\\"Team !! rowspan=\\"2\\"Year !! colspan=\\"6\\"Regular season !! colspan=\\"1\\"Post season - !

He was a self made man, came from a non-telugu family, without any film background and, reached to super star status in ealry 1980's to late 1990's in telugu film industry with his great efforts and hard work. His Fighting skills with Martial arts, gained super popularity to him in telugu film industry, which are later adopted by the rest of the telugu film industry. He was one of the very few actors in film industry who has martal arts background. He also introduced martial arts to the film industry. He was the most handsome hero and has many woman followers during that period. He was a contemporary of Chranjeevi and almost gained equal star status like him in 1980's. Most of his movies in 1980's and 1990's performed very well at box office and celebrated silver jubilees. His first movie in Telugu was Tarangini which was performed very well at box office, ran for 365 days. He was known for his discipline and dedication towards his work, used to work 16 to 18 hours per day during those days. He acted in both Tamil and Telugu movies in 1982-1983. Based on the commercial success of most of his movies in telugu at that time, he focused more in telugu industry from 1983 onwards. Tarangini, Neti Bharatham, Navodhayam,Kalyana Veena, Ee Charithra Inka Ennallu, Sitara, Nyayam mire Cheppali, are the few of his movies in early 1980' consistently performed very well at box office and gained him stardom. He was on very high demand during that time, given very tough and healthy compilation to his contemporaries. Ugranetrudu, Bandipotu, ukkusankellu, Palnati rudrayya are some of his movies portrayed him as a angry young man and he gained mass hero image, made him super star. All of his \\"Alludu Series\\" movies like America alludu, Peddinti alludu, Chinna alludu, Hello alludu, Donga alludu are highly successful at Box office and collected good revenue. These moviese made him closer to family audience. He shared the screen space with legendary actors like ANR, Sobhan Babu, Krishnam Raju, and Krishna in movies and received appreciations from audience. He acted with Venkatesh in Kondapalli Raja as his friend which was a huge success, and with Nagarjuna in Annamayya which was referred as one of his best work till date.

She is portrayed by British actress Debra Stephenson. Shell was one of the lead characters in the series. Shell appeared from the first episode in Series 1 until the last episode of Series 3, and returned for the first four episodes of Series 5. Dockley is the most feared inmate of the prison's ‚ÄòG Wing‚Äô, and commits several crimes, including smuggling drugs into the prison, stabbing prison officer Jim Fenner, and planning for Denny to set Snowball Merriman's hair on fire. ==Personality and characterization== Shell Dockley is sentenced to life imprisonment for torturing and murdering a girl named Lisa Simmonds, who had an affair with her boyfriend; she tied the girl up, tortured her and eventually set her on fire. Shell is violent and ruthless, and delights in acts of cruelty and torture; officers and prisoners alike call her a psychopath. She is a drug dealer and pusher, and has no real friends on the wing, except Daniella \\"Denny\\" Blood (Alicya Eyo), a relationship that is also sexual. Shell has an affair with corrupt principal officer Jim Fenner (Jack Ellis), a relationship which eventually goes sour in Series 2 after Jim discovered that Shell had telephoned his wife Marilyn (Kim Taylforth) to hear him and Shell having sex. Jim responds by beating up Shell. Jim and Shell's relationship ends for good after she stabs him with a broken bottle in the opening episode of Series 3. In Series 2, Shell states that the judge who sentenced her to life imprisonment had called her \\"evil personified\\". ==Storylines== Series 1 Shell was seen as Top Dog among the prisoners of G-Wing. She is first seen rehearsing for the prison's annual fashion show, which is soon cancelled. She is best friends with Denny, who is also her occasional lover. She is involved in a relationship with married officer Jim Fenner, who is also having an affair with Rachel Hicks (Joanne Froggatt), a young prisoner who Shell bullied. Eventually, Rachel commits suicide. When she discovers Zandra Plackett (Lara Cazalet) was blackmailing officer Lorna Rose (Luisa Bradshaw- White), she too began blackmailing Lorna and forced her to smuggle in drugs for her. Shell also made an enemy of religious prisoner Crystal Gordon (Sharon Duncan Brewster), but briefly became religious and together she and Crystal reported Lorna and got her sacked. Shell soon reverted to her old ways. Shell is usurped as top dog on G Wing by Yvonne Atkins (Linda Henry) by the end of Series 1. Series 2 Shell gets a mobile phone smuggled into Larkhall and calls Fenner's wife, Marilyn, to let her know about the affair. She makes an enemy of Barbara \\"Babs\\" Hunt (Isabelle Amyes), and when they get into a fight, Babs pushes Shell resulting in an injury. However, Shell doesn't report her, due to Babs being much older and timid. Shell then fears if the truth about the fight got out, it will damage her \\"tough girl\\" image. Shell then begins acting strangely and eventually tells Wing Governor Karen Betts (Claire King) that she was sexually abused by her father as a child. She is vexed when she discovers Karen is now in a relationship with Fenner. When Fenner enters her cell and begins having sex with her, she pulls out a broken glass bottle and stabs him in the stomach with it. Series 3 Karen hears Fenner screaming after Shell stabs him and almost the entire prison staff attempt to save him. However, Shell barricades the door, and makes demands to be brought up to her cell in a swinger. The other prisoners cheer her on as they all hate Fenner. When her cell door is finally broken down, she is eventually restrained. Sylvia Hollamby (Helen Fraser) is furious when Shell is allowed back on G-Wing, so has her transferred to the psychiatric unit of the prison, which the inmates refer to as \\"the muppet wing\\". She forces Shell to share a cell with \\"Mad\\" Tessa Spall (Helen Schlesinger), a former G-Wing prisoner whom Shell did not get along with. However, Tessa appears to become infatuated by Shell. When Sylvia sees her plan is not working, she tells another mental patient, \\"Podger\\" Pam Jolly (Wendi Peters), that Shell has stolen her medication, and then lets Pam into the shower where Shell is. Pam brutally beats up Shell, while a delighted Sylvia looks on. Fenner eventually helps Shell escape. Denny and her girlfriend Shaz Wiley (Lindsey Fawcett) escape with her, however they lose Shaz, who is subsequently caught and returned. Shell and Denny stay with a pimp in Kings Cross for the night, and the next day wear wigs to conceal their identities. They break into the Hollamby residence, and when Sylvia returns home, they take her hostage and force her to dress as French maid and serve them cocaine on a tray. When her undertaker husband Bobby returns home, they take him hostage too. The pair also take the Hollambys' money and Shell wrecks Sylvia's priceless ornaments. That night, Shell and Denny tie Bobby and Sylvia up, before going to bed together. The next morning, when Shell discovers Bobby has tried to break free, she places him in a coffin in their garage, and forces Sylvia to nail the coffin shut. Shell then begins to pour petrol over the coffin. After tying Sylvia to the garage door, Shell sets the coffin on fire. As the police arrive, Shell and Denny make a run for it in Bobby's hearse. They hide out in former cellmate Crystal's place. Shell overhears Crystal trying to warn Denny about her, so the next morning Shell plants drugs in Crystal's bedroom and calls the police, impersonating a civilian telling them that Crystal helped hide them. They immediately leave and tell Crystal they are going to stay with Shell's auntie Nelly in Scotland - this is lies as they both go to leave for Spain with false passports. Crystal is subsequently arrested and returned to Larkhall. Shell and Denny are not seen again until the last episode of the series, where Shell makes a phone call to Sylvia, impersonating a mattress sales person. She asks Sylvia if her husband would prefer to sleep in a black coffin instead. Sylvia becomes terrified as she realises Shell is on the other end of the phone. The call is traced and Shell and Denny are arrested on a boat, however they make one last escape, and jump into the sea. Hiatus Shell does not appear in Series 4, but is mentioned numerous times. At first, it is reported on the news that neither Shell or Denny were found in the sea, much to Sylvia's delight. But Denny is later re-captured and returned to Larkhall, with news that Shell was last seen speed boating while under the influence of drugs and is presumed dead. Sylvia and Bobby later visit the spot where Shell \\"died\\" for closure. Series 5 Shell, it seems, did not actually drown and is discovered in a strip club in Amsterdam by Fenner and other officers on a weekend trip. Shell is captured and reveals that she is pregnant. She plans to finish her sentence in Amsterdam, hoping that she is not extradited back to England. She is set up by her former lover Jeremy Pugh and is forced to return to Larkhall. Once back in Larkhall, she goes back on the lifers unit and immediately sets up a deal with Fenner, who begins pimping her to the male prison officers. Shell and Denny are also reunited, and plan to get revenge on Snowball Merriman (Nicole Faraday) for killing Shaz. Shell gets Snowball on her side by promising to give her a beauty makeover. After getting Snowball prepared for a makeover, Denny then proceeds to set fire to Snowball's hair. Shell continues her business with Fenner and soon goes into labour, giving birth to a baby boy who she names Ronan Beckham Dockley. Prison officer Colin Hedges (Tristan Surrock) later comes into Shell's cell and forces her to have sex with him, but Shell refuses to do so in front of her child. Fenner hears the shouting and enters the cell to find Colin there. A nurse enters the room and Fenner, not wanting his secret with Shell and the other officers exposed, lies and tells the nurse that Shell tried to smother her baby. Shell is later removed from the prison and sent to a mental hospital. Ronan is then taken into care. ==Bad Girls: The Musical== The character of Shell Dockley also appeared in Bad Girls: The Musical, a musical adaptation based on the television series. In this version she was portrayed by Nicole Faraday, who in the series portrayed Snowball Merriman, one of Shell's enemies. ==Reception== Shell was voted #2 on the top ten Bad Girls special, Bad Girls: Most Wanted, which was hosted by Jack Ellis. She was voted #8 on Virgin Media's \\"Top 10 TV Criminals\\". ==ReferencesExternal links== * Shell Dockley character profile Category:Bad Girls (TV series) Category:Fictional bisexual females Category:Television characters introduced in 1999 Category:Fictional chefs Category:Fictional child sexual abuse victims Category:Fictional dancers Category:Female villains Category:Fictional drug dealers Category:Female characters in television Category:Fictional murderers Category:Fictional prison escapees Category:Fictional torturers Category:Fictional smokers Category:Fictional prisoners and detainees Category:Fictional child killers ","title":"Shell Dockley"},{"id":"12363563","text":"Catherine Herrold Troeh (January 5, 1911 ‚Äì June 28, 2007) was an American historian, artist, activist and advocate for Native American rights and culture, especially in the Pacific Northwest. She was a member and elder of the Chinook tribe and a direct descendant of the great chief, or tyee, of the Chinook people, Comcomly. ==Early life== Troeh was born in Ilwaco, Pacific County, Washington, 24 minutes after her identical twin sister, Charlotte. Both sisters went on to attend school at St. Vincent's Hospital in Portland, Oregon, sometime around the year 1933. Catherine Troeh later enrolled at the University of Washington and received a bachelor's degree in public health. Troeh worked as a nurse for several Seattle area hospitals and for the Seattle Health Department. She also opened and owned an antique store in Burien, Washington. ==Activism== Troeh was an active member of the Chinook Indian Tribe. She was the only woman to join the newly formed Chinook Tribal Council in 1952. She wrote a Native American-focused newsletter, which was distributed at least once a month during her lifetime. Troeh was a major advocate for federal recognition of her Chinook tribe. In addition, she worked closely with Washington's Duwamish tribe. She attended the opening and celebration of the Duwamish's new tribal cultural center and longhouse on June 23, 2007, just days before her death. Troeh collaborated with a number of important Native American activists in Washington, including her older sister, Betsy Trick, Pearl Warren, and University of Washington anthropology professor Erna Gunther. Together the women founded an organization called the American Indian Women's Service League (AIWSL) in 1958. The American Indian Women's Service League was created in response to a growing trend of Native Americans moving from reservations and to large cities beginning in the 1950s. The main purpose of the league was to help counsel newly arrived Native Americans on the cultural differences and new challenges of modern American urban life that were not faced in their reservations. The AIWSL gradually evolved into several other Native American organizations, including the Seattle Indian Health Board, the United Indians of All Tribes, and the Seattle Indian Center. Troeh served on the board of the Seattle Indian Center until her death. In addition to her work as an activist, Troeh was a strong promoter of Native American culture. She collected Native American artifacts. Troeh often signed her letters \\"member of the Chinook Tribe Allottee 1865 Quinault reservation.\\" Her unusual way of signing letters referred to the which were granted to her by the U.S. federal government. ==Death== In 2007, Troeh died in Burien, Washington at the age of 96. She was survived by her twin sister, Charlotte, and two children, Charlotte Killien and Arnold. Her twin sister died three years later in 2010. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Historic longhouse groundbreaking for Duwamish tribe *Seattle Indian Center *University of Washington's History of the American Indian Women's Service League Category:1911 births Category:2007 deaths Category:20th-century Native Americans Category:21st-century Native Americans Category:American women activists Category:Identical twins Category:Indigenous people of the Pacific Northwest Category:Native American activists Category:Native American artists Category:People from Burien, Washington Category:People from Ilwaco, Washington Category:Twin people from the United States Category:University of Washington School of Public Health alumni ","title":"Catherine Troeh"},{"id":"12363573","text":"Diffusionless transformations classifications A diffusionless transformation is a phase change that occurs without the long-range diffusion of atoms but rather by some form of cooperative, homogeneous movement of many atoms that results in a change in crystal structure. These movements are small, usually less than the interatomic distances, and the atoms maintain their relative relationships. The ordered movement of large numbers of atoms leads some to refer to these as military transformations in contrast to civilian diffusion- based phase changes.D.A. Porter and K.E. Easterling, Phase transformations in metals and alloys, Chapman & Hall, 1992, p.172 The most commonly encountered transformation of this type is the martensitic transformation which, while being probably the most studied, is only one subset of non-diffusional transformations. The martensitic transformation in steel represents the most economically significant example of this category of phase transformations, but an increasing number of alternatives, such as shape memory alloys, are becoming more important as well. == Classification and definitions == When a structural change occurs by the coordinated movement of atoms (or groups of atoms) relative to their neighbors then the change is termed displacive transformation. This covers a broad range of transformations and so further classifications have been developed [Cohen 1979]. The first distinction can be drawn between transformations dominated by lattice-distortive strains and those where shuffles are of greater importance. Homogeneous lattice-distortive strains, also known as Bain strains, are strains that transform one Bravais lattice into a different one. This can be represented by a strain matrix S which transforms one vector, y, into a new vector, x: :y=Sx This is homogeneous as straight lines are transformed into new straight lines. Examples of such transformations include a cubic lattice increasing in size on all three axes (dilation) or shearing into a monoclinic structure. right Shuffles, as the name suggests, involve the small movement of atoms within the unit cell. As a result, pure shuffles do not normally result in a shape change of the unit cell - only its symmetry and structure. Phase transformations normally result in the creation of an interface between the transformed and parent material. The energy required to generate this new interface will depend on its nature - essentially how well the two structures fit together. An additional energy term occurs if the transformation includes a shape change since, if the new phase is constrained by the surrounding material, this may give rise to elastic or plastic deformation and hence a strain energy term. The ratio of these interfacial and strain energy terms has a notable effect on the kinetics of the transformation and the morphology of the new phase. Thus, shuffle transformations, where distortions are small, are dominated by interfacial energies and can be usefully separated from lattice-distortive transformations where the strain energy tends to have a greater effect. A subclassification of lattice-distortive displacements can be made by considering the dilational and shear components of the distortion. In transformations dominated by the shear component, it is possible to find a line in the new phase that is undistorted from the parent phase while all lines are distorted when the dilation is predominant. Shear dominated transformations can be further classified according to the magnitude of the strain energies involved compared to the innate vibrations of the atoms in the lattice and hence whether the strain energies have a notable influence on the kinetics of the transformation and the morphology of the resulting phase. If the strain energy is a significant factor then the transformations are dubbed martensitic and if it is not the transformation is referred to as quasi- martensitic. ==Iron-Carbon Martensitic transformation== The difference between austenite and martensite is, in some ways, quite small: while the unit cell of austenite is, on average, a perfect cube, the transformation to martensite distorts this cube by interstitial carbon atoms that do not have time to diffuse out during displacive transformation. The unit cell becomes slightly longer in one dimension and shorter in the other two. The mathematical description of the two structures is quite different, for reasons of symmetry (see external links), but the chemical bonding remains very similar. Unlike cementite, which has bonding reminiscent of ceramic materials, the hardness of martensite is difficult to explain in chemical terms. The explanation hinges on the crystal's subtle change in dimension. Even a microscopic crystallite is millions of unit cells long. Since all of these units face the same direction, distortions of even a fraction of a percent become magnified into a major mismatch between neighboring materials. The mismatch is sorted out by the creation of myriad crystal defects, in a process reminiscent of work hardening. As in work-hardened steel, these defects prevent atoms from sliding past one another in an organized fashion, causing the material to become harder. Shape memory alloys also have surprising mechanical properties, which were eventually explained by analogy to martensite. Unlike the iron-carbon system, alloys in the nickel-titanium system can be chosen that make the \\"martensitic\\" phase thermodynamically stable. ==Pseudomartensitic transformation== In addition to displacive transformation and diffusive transformation, a new type of phase transformation that involves a displasive sublattice transition and atomic diffusion was discovered using a high- pressure x-ray diffraction system. The new transformation mechanism has been christened a pseudomartensitic transformation.Kristin Leutwyler New phase transition Scientific American, May 2, 2001. ==References== Notes Bibliography * Christian, J.W., Theory of Transformations in Metals and Alloys, Pergamon Press (1975) * Khachaturyan, A.G., Theory of Structural Transformations in Solids, Dover Publications, NY (1983) * Green, D.J.; Hannink, R.; Swain, M.V.

Portrayed by Helen Fraser from the first episode in 1999 until the last in 2006, she was the longest serving prison officer on the show with convicts Julie Johnston (Kika Mirylees) and Julie Saunders (Victoria Alcock) being the only other characters to last all eight series. ==Personality== While Sylvia is the most law abiding of the genuinely corrupt prison staff, she is racist and intolerant of homosexuality. She constantly complains about her job and is usually most happy if sitting down to a cup of tea or reading a magazine rather than working. She hates almost of the wing governors, usually the younger female governors with Jim Fenner being her favourite choice to hold the position. She hates all the prisoners and treats all the prisoners with contempt, regardless of how severe or tame their crime had been and generally believes that \\"happiness is door shaped\\" thus fuelling her believe that all prisoners should be on 24 Hour Lock-down thus making life easier for the officers and especially her, she also believes that there should be Closed Visits thus curtailing the drug problems that constantly blight prisons including and especially Larkhall. She is not a fan of the \\"touchy feely prison warding\\" that was a feature of the progressive policies unsuccessfully implemented by Governors such as Grayling, in her mind a con is a con is a con and they don't get any special treatment. Unsurprisingly Three attempts were made on her life, the prisoners pushing her down the stairs; Shell Dockley and Denny Blood almost burning her and her husband Bobby; her second husband Dr. Nicholson attempting to kill her on their honeymoon. Despite her hostility towards the prisoners, two escaped inmates Bev Tull (Amanda Barrie) and Phyl Oswyn (Stephanie Beacham) saved her from being murdered by Dr. Nicholson (Philip McGough). ==Storylines== Series 1 In the first episode, she is first seen ignoring a pregnant prisoner who is suffering a miscarriage. She despises all the prisoners and is extremely harsh on all the new arrivals. She orders a violent strip search to be placed on Nikki Wade (Mandana Jones). She can't stand religious prisoner Crystal Gordan's constant guitar playing and singing. She is happy when the prisoners are forced to have closed visits. She mocks Rachel Hicks when she is sent to the 4 bed dorm with Denny, whom is bullying her. She also makes digs at posh Monica Lyndsey, making derogatory references to her affluent background. Series 2 She is in trouble with Governor Karen Betts (Claire King) after she places mental patient, \\"Mad\\" Tessa Spall (Helen Schlesinger), onto G-Wing, believing her to be Barbara \\"Babs\\" Hunt (Isabelle Amyes), who she sends to the psychiatric unit, which the prisoners refer to as the \\"muppet wing\\". As punishment, Karen forces her to take on a strict fitness regime, in the prison grounds, the prisoners ridicule her over this. When she discovers Julie Johnston is illegally receiving a visit from her children - after her husband got a court order preventing her from seeing them - she terminates the visit leaving Julie devastated. The prisoners have decided they have had enough of Sylvia's abuse of her authority and push her down the stairs. Sylvia is demoted from Senior Prison Officer to Prison Officer, because she allowed Shaz Wiley (Lindsey Fawcett) and Denny Blood (Alicya Eyo) to lock her in their cell and enter the canteen kitchen. She and her husband Bobby Hollamby (Geoffrey Hutchings) later celebrate their 30th wedding anniversary in the Prison Officers Club, where a drink spiked with ecstasy causes her to reveal her true feelings to her husband. Later that night her close friend Jim Fenner (Jack Ellis) is stabbed in the stomach by Shell Dockley (Debra Stephenson). Series 3 Sylvia is determined to make Shell pay for nearly killing Fenner. She is furious when Shell is allowed back on G-Wing, so has her transferred to'the muppet wing' - she makes Shell share a cell with \\"Mad\\" Tessa, however Tessa appears to become infatuated by Shell, when Sylvia sees her plan is not working, she tells another mental patient, \\"Podger\\" Pam Jolly (Wendi Peters), that Shell has stolen her medication, and then lets Pam into the shower where Shell is. Pam brutally beats up Shell, while a delighted Sylvia looks on. Fenner eventually helps Shell escape, along with Denny and her girlfriend Shaz, however they lose Shaz, who is subsequently caught and returned. Shell and Denny wear wigs to conceal their identities. They break into the Hollamby residence, and when Sylvia returns home they take her hostage and force her to dress as French maid and serve them cocaine on a tray. When her undertaker husband Bobby returns home, they take him hostage too. They also take the Hollambys' money and Shell wrecks Sylvia's priceless ornaments. Sylvia tries to explain to them that what she does is just a job and that she doesn't really enjoy tormenting the prisoners. Shell and Denny laugh hysterically at this, knowing that Sylvia loves her job. That night, they tie Bobby and Sylvia up. The next morning, when Shell discovers Bobby has tried to break free, she places him in a coffin in their garage, and forces Sylvia to nail the coffin shut and to pour petrol over it. After tying Sylvia to the garage door, Shell sets the coffin on fire. As the police arrive, Shell and Denny make a run for it in Bobby's hearse. They leave to go to Spain with false passports. After Sylvia eventually returns to works, she receives a phonecall from Shell, impersonating a mattress saleswoman. She asks Sylvia if her husband would prefer to sleep in a black coffin instead. Sylvia becomes terrified as she realises Shell is on the other end of the phone. The call is traced and Shell and Denny are arrested on a boat, however they make one last escape, and jump into the sea. Series 4 Sylvia is overjoyed when she discovers Denny and Shell were never found in the sea, and believed to be dead. She and Bobby holiday in the same place where they \\"died\\". Much to her horror, Denny is found and later extradited back to G-Wing. Sylvia is less afraid of Denny, and warns her she will get revenge on her and that she will wish she was as \\"dead as Dockley\\". Sylvia is briefly promoted to Wing Governor, and on the day when inspectors arrive at Larkhall, she discovers Maxi Purvis (Kerry Norton) is dead, and not wanting to let the inspectors see, she hides the body in the prison chapel, which is later discovered. Although Al McKenzie (Pauline Campbell) helped Maxi kill herself by choking herself with toilet roll, Maxi's enemy Shaz becomes a suspect. Sylvia immediately has her transferred to another prison, however she has done this as more of a punishment for Shaz's girlfriend Denny. Denny runs to attack Sylvia but is then sent down the block. Sylvia then throws her toilet roll and tells her to do the same as Maxi. Series 5 Sylvia's worst fears become reality as Shell is found alive and heavily pregnant in Amsterdam, and extradited back to G-Wing. Things go from bad to worse when she discovers her husband Bobby is badly in financial debt. Bobby commits suicide by gassing himself in his own hearse. New inmates, Bev Tull and Phyl Oswyn - who have tricked Denny into believing Bev is a medium and has contacted her dead girlfriend Shaz - trick Sylvia into thinking they can contact Bobby, as long as she pays them with gin. Sylvia later develops feelings for Rev. Henry Mills (Michael Elwyn), however Henry falls in love with prisoner Babs Hunt - who is due for release. Henry and Babs get married in the prison chapel on Babs' last day. Series 6 Sylvia constantly makes racist remarks about Jamaican prisoner Darlene Cake (Antonia Okonma). When new Wing Governor Frances Myers (Eva Pope) discovers this, she forces Sylvia to make a public apology to Darlene in front of the other prisoners, this once again makes Sylvia a laughing stock. When Frances sparks a war with Phyl over drugs, Sylvia is forced to take Phyl's breakfast to her. Phyl is infuriated to discover that her meals will be reduced to bread and water from now on, so throws the glass of water in Sylvia's face. She then orders to speak to Frances. Sylvia then develops feelings for Dr. Malcolm Nicholson, at the wedding of Fenner and Di Barker (Tracey Wilkinson), she catches the bouquet and asks Nicholson if he believes in fate. Series 7 Sylvia finally gets some good news when she discovers that her Aunt Margaret has died and left her a palatial, antique stuffed house in Hampstead in her will. Nicholson hears about this and pretends to reciprocate her feelings for him. They later get married, and honeymoon in the Costa del Sol, unaware that Phyl and Bev, who recently escaped from Larkhall are staying in the hotel room next door. Nicholson ties her up and attempts to inject her with an empty syringe thus creating an air bubble and bringing on an embolism, Phyl and Bev, despite their hatred towards her, save her, and Phyl shoots Nicholson while describing him as a \\"loathsome little man\\" , killing him. After the murder, Bev and Phyl are on their way out of the hotel with the diamonds they found with the gun that Phyl killed Nicholson with. Just as they are about to exit the hotel, Sylvia appears on the balcony screaming, leading to a startled Bev to drop the diamonds, and she is violently arrested. Phyl, however, escapes. A few weeks later, Phyl is captured again and is sent back to Larkhall. Following both Bev and Phyl's returns, Sylvia pays them both back with a bottle of gin each. That Christmas, new Governor of Larkhall, Joy Masterton (Ellie Haddington), orders for all the staff to come to work in fancy dress. Sylvia comes to work as Florence Nightingale. Joy then orders Sylvia to take Phyl down to the cellar to fix the boiler and electricity as they are not working. There, Sylvia thanks Phyl yet again for saving her from Nicholson's evil clutches. They encounter dozens of rats, and while in the room with the boiler, Sylvia suffers a panic attack after finding a rat underneath her dress. She subsequently falls down the steps to the cellar, knocking herself unconscious and blocking the door, leaving Phyl trapped. After the boiler and electricity are fixed, the flickering lights force Sylvia to come round and let Phyl out of the room. When they return indoors from the freezing cold snow storm outside, Joy then gives Sylvia orders to find Chaplain. Christy Mackay (Gaynor Howe), who has been murdered in the shower by new inmate Miranda Miles (Nicola Redmond). Sylvia's screams alert the entire prison, leading to Joy and Kevin Spiers (Andrew Scarborough) to investigate. Following this, Miranda is sent to a psychiatric hospital. Series 8 Sylvia has been promoted once again to Wing Governor, as Christmas approaches, she keeps the women locked in their cells, making them hate her even further, she also disapproves of her openly homosexual son Bobby Darren's relationship with a man, which causes a further rift between her and her son. She is unaware that evil inmate Natalie Buxton (Dannielle Brent) was recently killed and her body dumped in the prison sewers. She suffers a Scrooge-like dream when the ghost of Natalie appears to her and shows her that she is just as hated as she was, she shows Sylvia how happy everyone, including her son, would be after hearing she was dead, she then takes Sylvia down to the sewers, where her own decomposing corpse is, but the corpse Sylvia sees is that of her own. She later makes peace with her son and gives the prisoners a happy Christmas, but tells them not to get too used to her good nature, as it's \\"business as usual\\" tomorrow. She then dances with her son and the inmates. This was the last episode. ==Reception== Sylvia has become one of the most popular characters on the show, and despite the characters bigoted views she has become somewhat of a gay icon. The last ever episode centers around the character in which she suffers a Scrooge-like dream.

He is best known as the Baal Shem Tov's brother-in-law. == Rabbinical career == A scion of a famous rabbinic family, Abraham Gershon is a descendant (possibly the grandson) of Shabsai Cohen (\\"the ShACh\\") (1625‚Äì1663). Both Abraham Gershon and his father Ephraim of Brody served in one of the four beit din (Jewish Court) of Brody. It was here that he and his father encountered Rabbi Israel \\"Baal Shem Tov\\". According to the early Chasidic work Shivchei haBesht, his father gave his blessing of marriage for his sister Chana to the Baal Shem Tov on his deathbed. But once Ephraim died, Abraham Gershon was unaware of this secret betrothal until the Baal Shem Tov revealed the engagement contract. Abraham Gershon rose to a powerful position within the Jewish community of Brody. For a time he served as a synagogue cantor. Shivchei haBesht portrays Abraham Gershon as a foil to the Baal Shem Tov. He is usually represented as a learned and lofty man of the upper class who regards his brother-in-law as lowly and untrustworthy. Abraham Gershon is probably responsible for kicking the Baal Shem Tov out of the Brody area where he ultimately settled in Medzhybizh. Later, when the Baal Shem Tov's piousness and scholarship were revealed, Abraham Gershon was won over and became one of the Baal Shem Tov's ardent admirers. In 1745, Abraham Gershon was involved in ruling on a promiscuity case about the daughter-in-law of one of the wealthiest men in town. This man had strong connections to government officials. After ruling against the daughter-in-law, Abraham Gershon was forced to flee Brody to avoid being publicly punished. He took refuge with the Baal Shem Tov in Medzhybizh.Hamodia (22 May 2008) p. C6 Affiliated with new Hasidic thoughts as well as traditional Lurian liturgy, the Baal Shem Tov entrusted his brother-in-law with the education of his only son, Tzvi. In 1747, Abraham Gershon traveled to Jerusalem, one of the first Hasidim to establish a presence in the Holy Land. There he embraced the Rashash, together with those who were students of Kabbalah. He lived in Hebron for six years. In 1753, he moved to Jerusalem and was further associated with the (kabbalistic) Yeshivat Beit El. He died in 1761 and was buried on the Mount of Olives. After the Six-Day War in 1967, his grave was rediscovered along with the grave of his second wife Bluma. ==See also== * History of the Jews in Brody * Baal Shem Tov family tree * Yishuv haYashan ==References== * Chapin, David A. and Weinstock, Ben, The Road from Letichev: The history and culture of a forgotten Jewish community in Eastern Europe, Volume 1. iUniverse, Lincoln, NE, 2000. * Rabinowicz, Tzvi M.

It is the most distinctive Asian member of the family due to its flattened head and trailing dorsal fins. Although first described in 1822, it was not placed in its own genus until 1861 when Theodore Gill erected Sillaginopsis, a genus which is still monotypic. Gangetic whiting are of minor commercial importance along the Southeast coast of the Asian continent where it inhabits protected areas. ==Taxonomy and naming== The Gangetic whiting is the only species of the genus Sillaginopsis, which itself is one of three genera the family Sillaginidae, containing all the smelt whitings. The Sillaginidae are part of the Percoidei, a suborder of the order Perciformes. The Gangetic whiting was originally named Cheilodipterus panijus in 1822 by Francis Buchanan-Hamilton from a holotype taken from the Ganges estuary in India. The species was further examined by Gill in 1861 in the first review of the family, entitled \\"Synopsis of the Sillaginoids\\", which led to the creation of the genus Sillaginopsis. This new classification changed the binomial name to the currently accepted Sillaginopsis panijus. ==Description== The distinct appearance of the Gangetic whiting makes it the easiest of the smelt whitings to identify. The head of the species is highly depressed, like that of the flatheads, with very small eyes well constricted by the orbits. The first dorsal fin contains ten spines including a large trailing second spine; the second dorsal fin has one spine and 25 to 27 soft rays. The anal fin has two spines and 24 to 27 soft rays. There are 84 to 90 lateral line scales and the species has a total of 42 vertebrae. The species is known to grow to a length of 44 cm. Another unique feature of this species is its severe reduction or even absence of a swim bladder, which all other members of the family Sillaginidae possess. The Gangetic whiting also has a small mouth with a much shorter lower jaw than upper jaw, with the two anteriormost teeth larger than the rest. ==Distribution and habitat== The Gangetic whiting is found on the southern Asian coast from Puducherry in the east, northward along the Coromandel Coast and the Ganges delta, Myanmar, Malaysia and occasionally as far south as the Indonesian archipelago. The species is often found on silty or muddy substrates in shallow, open bays and estuaries along the coast. Juveniles usually migrate into the upper reaches of estuaries for protection against predation by larger species. ==Biology== Gut content analysis has found the Gangetic whiting consumes numerous small fish, benthic and planktonic crustaceans and algae, with its small mouth size restricting the size of food portions. The Gangetic whiting is the only known species of fish to host the intestinal parasite Dichelyne alatae, found in specimens in West Bengal, with a number of other parasites identified from it. Otolith and size-age composition studies by Krishnayya (1963) of the commercial catches from the Hooghly River estuary and found that S. panijus probably spawns twice a year during the periods of November to February and August to September. The juveniles migrate toward the upper reaches during March and April and during December where they remain for two to three months. Sexual maturity is attained at a length of about 120 mm. ==Relationship to humans== A local fishery exists along the coast of the Bay of Bengal primarily near or on the river deltas, with commercially important fish captured by nets and longlines in the Hooghly and Ganges delta. The Gangetic whiting is sold fresh in local markets, rarely making its way to overseas markets. Juvenile Sillaginopsis panijus are also occasionally traded as brackish water aquarium fish. ==References== Category:Sillaginidae Category:Fish of South Asia Category:Fish described in 1822 ","title":"Gangetic whiting"},{"id":"12363663","text":"Edwyn Burnaby may refer to: *Edwyn Burnaby (courtier) (1798‚Äì1867), English landowner, Justice of the Peace, Deputy Lieutenant, and High Sheriff of Leicestershire *Edwyn Burnaby (politician) (1830‚Äì1883), his son, an English major general and Member of Parliament for Leicestershire North ","title":"Edwyn Burnaby"},{"id":"12363694","text":"Cliff Sarde is an American composer, multi-instrumentalist and recording artist. == Biography == Cliff Sarde is a GRAMMY nominated composer, video editor and recording artist who has received an Emmy, Telly, and numerous Addy awards.

She played a prominent role in Series 2, 3, 4 and 5 as Top Dog of G-Wing, until she was murdered by Jim Fenner (Jack Ellis) in the last episode of Series 5. ==Storylines== Series 1 Yvonne received four years for conspiracy to commit murder after she hired a hit-man to kill a business rival of her husband Charlie, a London gangster. Upon entering Larkhall, she does her best to wind up Sylvia Hollamby (Helen Fraser) by using her smarts and her connections on the outside. She promptly becomes Top Dog of G-Wing, but doesn't seem to abuse her power maliciously. She helps protect other inmates from the bullying tendencies of Shell Dockley (Debra Stephenson) and others. Series 2 Yvonne starts a sex hotline called \\"Babes Behind Bars\\" until it is eventually found out by the prison officers. Later, Yvonne's arch-rival, Renee Williams (Alison Newman), arrives on G-Wing. She sets about bullying and intimidating the other prisoners, and racially abuses black inmates and officers on the wing. She reveals to Yvonne that she had been sleeping with her husband, Charlie, before she got sent to prison, and later tries to attack her in the toilets with a razor blade, but Nikki Wade steps in to help. Renee is eating dinner one day and suddenly; she stops eating, starts wheezing, her face quickly turning red. She falls to the floor, clutching her throat and gasping for breath, but she expires too quickly for the officers to help. It is later revealed to the viewers that Yvonne had put crushed peanuts into a pepper-shaker, which caused anaphylactic shock. Yvonne later manages to get out of the prison for a day accompanied by Jim Fenner (Jack Ellis) and Sylvia. She pretends she needs to go to the toilet, so they take her into a pub to use their facilities. Here she tries to escape through a window, but Fenner stops her, after reading in the newspaper that Yvonne's husband Charlie had been arrested. Much later on, her estranged husband is assassinated outside of court, after the jury claim he is innocent, though in fact, there was pressure on the jury to make that decision. Yvonne learns that it was her daughter Lauren who organised the hit, in revenge for his infidelity. Series 3 Yvonne finds herself defending the young inmate Shaz Wiley (Lindsey Fawcett), who is left lonely and vulnerable after her girlfriend Denny Blood (Alicya Eyo) escapes from Larkhall with Shell. She is being bullied by the recently arrived Peckham Boot Gang, consisting of Maxi Purvis (Kerry Norton), Tina O'Kane (Victoria Bush) and Al McKenzie (Pauline Campbell). They get Shaz's friend Buki Lester (Kim Oliver) in on their plan, and have her lure Shaz into a trap by inviting her to a \\"party\\" in the laundry room. Shaz agrees to go, unaware that there is no party and she is being tricked into meeting up with violent bully Al McKenzie, who intends to attack her. Yvonne gets wind of the plan, however, and surprises Al by showing up in place of Shaz. Al attempts to attack Yvonne, but finds herself grossly outmatched. Yvonne beats her up and warns her off; which intensifies the feud between herself and the Peckham Boot Gang. Yvonne also discovers Fenner is running brothels for wealthy madame Virginia O'Kane (Kate O'Mara) while she is in prison. She informs former Wing Governor Helen Stewart (Simone Lahbib), who has recently been sexually assaulted by Fenner, and of this; Helen sets out to gather evidence to bring Fenner down for good. Yvonne's involvement in this plot leads to a further feud between her and Fenner, who is also having an affair with Maxi, and conspiring with her to bring Yvonne down and instate Maxi as Top Dog. After G-Wing celebrates Nikki Wade's (Mandana Jones) successful appeal, Yvonne asks prison officer Di Barker (Tracey Wilkinson) for permission to take a bath. Virginia decides to go with her, but Di does not escort them. Whilst Yvonne listens to music on her headphones whilst in the bath, Virginia is drowned by an unseen assailant. Yvonne finds her body and becomes the prime suspect, believing Fenner has set her up.

Beach between the two main islands of the Shiants (Garbh Eilean and Eilean an Taighe) Garbh Eilean from Eilean an Taighe ==Geology== In geological terms, these islands essentially represent an extension of the Trotternish peninsula of Skye. The rocks are volcanic, and at 60 Ma, very young by Hebridean standards. Dolerite columns on the north side of Garbh Eilean are over tall and about across. Similar to those at Staffa and the Giant's Causeway, they were formed by the slow cooling of volcanic rocks deep underground. Intrusion sills show a progression in their chemical compositions, from olivine-rich rocks at the base to rocks with very little or no olivine at the top. The sills are thought to have formed by crystal settling. Recent study has suggested that at least one of the sills represents a multiple intrusion. In some places the basalt is overlain by Jurassic mudstone, which weathers to form much more fertile soil than elsewhere in the Western Isles. ==Economy== The islands were inhabited until the late 18th century, when changes in land ownership and society made the old way of life no longer viable. The previously inhabited and cultivated areas of √Äirighean a‚Äô Baigh and √Äirighean na h-Annaid are unusually fertile land. Feannagan may still be made out in these areas. Adam Nicolson, father of the present owner of the Shiants, published a book about them in 2001 under the title of Sea Room 'to tell the whole story'. ==Archaeology== There are several possible chapel sites. The first may have been dedicated to St Columba and have been on the west side of Garbh Eilean, perhaps at √Äirighean na h-Annaid - the name Annaid means Old Church. There is also evidence of a more recent church, dedicated to the Virgin, near the present cottage on Eilean an Taighe. A gold torc was dredged up by some Scalpay scallop fishermen south- west of the islands. This beautiful object dates from perhaps 1200BC, and while similar such torcs have turned up elsewhere in UK, this is by far the furthest north. It is possible to speculate endlessly about the provenance of such a find, and whether it got there by shipwreck, or as a votive offering. ==Wildlife== The Shiants are a major seabird breeding ground due to their location next to good feeding grounds and lack of predators. Huge numbers of puffins breed in burrows on the slopes of Garbh Eilean, as well as significant numbers of guillemots, razorbills, fulmars, kittiwakes, shags, gulls and great skuas. Although St Kilda has more puffins, the sheer density on the Shiants is greater. Until 2018 the island had a population of black rats, which may originally have come ashore from a shipwreck. Analysis of their stomach contents showed that the Shiant rats did eat seabirds, but it was impossible to tell if they preyed on live birds or simply scavenged remains.Paul Stapp (2002) Stable isotopes reveal evidence of predation by ship rats on seabirds on the Shiant Islands, Scotland Journal of Applied Ecology 39 (5), 831‚Äì840. These rats are now rare in the UK. On the Shiants their numbers have been controlled in and around the house for some time, and a comprehensive wildlife project has now extinguished the population. ==See also== * List of islands of Scotland * List of Outer Hebrides ==Footnotes== Category:Shiant Islands ","title":"Garbh Eilean"},{"id":"12363814","text":"Erwin Meister is a Swiss businessman who, with his partner Edwin Bollier, formed the company Mebo Telecommunications in 1969.

Colouration is pinkish, with the head and neck and the posterior few centimeters of the body a brighter pink than the midbody, or a paler pink head, vivid pink anteriorly, and the body becoming more lavender posteriorly. ==Habitat and conservation== Boulengerula fischeri is known from primary montane forest and small-holder farmland adjacent to the forest at elevations of above sea level. It lives in the soil, occasionally on the ground under leaf litter or plant stems. If similar to other Boulengerula, it would be oviparous and have direct development (no free-living larvae). This species is locally abundant and tolerates some habitat modification. It could be threatened by deforestation and agricultural intensification, including the use of agrochemicals. The area of the type locality is now included in the Nyungwe Forest National Park. ==References== fischeri Category:Endemic fauna of Rwanda Category:Amphibians of Rwanda Category:Amphibians described in 1994 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot Category:Taxa named by Ronald Archie Nussbaum ","title":"Boulengerula fischeri"},{"id":"12363863","text":"Boulengerula uluguruensis, the Uluguru pink caecilian or Uluguru African caecilian, is a species of amphibian in the family Caeciliidae.

It was considered monotypic, containing only the species Brasilotyphlus braziliensis. However, two recently described species, Brasilotyphlus guarantanus and Brasilotyphlus dubium, have been placed in this same genus. Both species have only been recorded from Brazilian Amazonia.Maciel, A.O. & M.S. Hoogmoed, \\"Taxonomy and distribution of caecilian amphibians (Gymnophiona) of Brazilian Amazonia, with a key to their identification\\" Zootaxa, 2984: 1-53 This genus has also been suggested as paraphyletic to Microcaecilia. ==Species== *Brasilotyphlus braziliensis *Brasilotyphlus dubium *Brasilotyphlus guarantanus ==History== The genus was discovered less than a century ago, and relatively little is known about it to date. The physical shape and structure of Brasilotyphlus has been recorded, while information concerning even basic biology, such as physiology and habitat, of this genus is lacking. Currently, it is known to be a subterranean genus living in the rainforest of Brazil.Miguel Trefaut Rodrigues, Claudia Azevedo-Ramos, Mark Wilkinson, \\"Brasilotyphlus braziliensis\\" IUCN Red List of Threatened Species Version 2012.2 Further, the threats to this genus are currently unknown, as its ability to adapt to a secondary habitat has not been observed. Both species have been located exclusively in Brazil. Their known locations are small and restricted. They were found independent of each other, and their habitats may not overlap. The closest known habitats for the two species, with respect to each other, are approximately 950 km apart.Adriano O. Maciel, Tami Mott, Marinus S. Hoogmoed, \\"A Second species of Brasilotyphlus (Amphibia:Gymnophiona:Caeciliidae) from Brazilian Amazonia\\" Zootaxa 2009 Beyond this there is little to no knowledge as to the distribution of this genus, which makes locating a subject for research quite difficult.Cardoso Pinheiro, Leandra, Youszef Oliveira Da Cunha Bitar, Ulisses Galatti, Selvino Neckel-Oliveira, and Maria Cristina Dos Santos-Costa \\"Amphibians from Southeastern State of Par√°: Caraj√°s Region, Northern Brazil\\" Check List 8.4 (2012): 693-702 The first of these species, Brasilotyphlus braziliensis has not even been seen since 1997. Even the classification of this genus is a source of confusion, as not all scholars agree on the phylogeny.Unknown, \\"Brasilotyphlus Braziliensis.\\", AmphibiaWeb ‚Äì Inaturalist, To date, no photographs have been published of the living Brasilotyphlus brasiliensis. ==Phylogeny== This genus has been strongly suggested to be put under taxonomic review. It was originally declared its own genus because of its distinct combination of characteristics. Namely, it had premaxillary teeth which did not extend to the level of the posterior nasal apertures. It had vomerine teeth which were organized in rows of compact semicircles and were separated from the palatine teeth by a gap. The eye was not visible externally, instead covered by thick bone. There were small tentacles which, in comparison to other caecillians of similar size, were much closer to the mouth. Lastly, the specimen has a weak vertical keel on the terminal part of the body. However, the finding of the second species, B. guarantanus, has redefined the genus characteristics. Now, the genus is described as diminutive caecilian, being no more than 305 mm in length. ==Cranial characteristics== The species B. guarantanus has been reported to have sexual dimorphism in the head.Mott, Tami, Mario Ribeiro De Moura, Adriano Oliveira Maciel, and Renato Neves Feio, \\"Morphological Variation and Geographical Distribution of Luetkenotyphlus Brasiliensis (Gymnophiona: Siphonopidae),\\" Phyllomedusa 10.2 (2011): 153-63, That is, the head of the male is wider than the head of the female. The genus Brasilotyphlus also has an open eye socket.Wake, Marvalee, and Maureen Donnelly, \\"A New Lungless Caecilian (Amphibia: Gymnophiona) from Guyana\\" Royal Society Publishing The eye was originally thought to not be visible from the outside or not be present at all.Edward Taylor, \\"The Caecilians of the World\\" Kansas Press 1968 One dissection concluded that the eyes were either too small to be seen by the naked eye, or not present. The bones of the skull are transparent, allowing the brain to be seen through them. The tentacular opening has a greater posterior distance from the nostril then that of other known Gymnophiona and is much closer to the mouth. Its tentacles are also relatively small. All specimens of B. brasiliensis have been flattened or otherwise damaged. Measurements are therefore estimated. Most of the data on this genus is taken from the species Brasilotyphlus guarantanus. ==Dentition== The genus Brasilotyphlus has a three-series dentition. The inner mandibular teeth are absent. The maxillary teeth can extend to or past the choanae, but do not always. It has a large diastema, or gap, between its vomerine and palatine teeth. It contains premaxillary, maxillary, prevomerine, and palatine teeth. Most teeth monocuspid. The prevomerine and palatine teeth are the only exceptions and they are bicuspid. The front end of the tongue is attached to the gums directly behind the dentary teeth. ==Scales== The genus Brasilotyphuls has dermal scales present in its folds. The scales are mostly present on the posterior end of the body. The species Brasilotyphlus braziliensis has scales which start around the 25th fold of the body. The scales start off very small. At the middle of the body there are two rows of scales. The remaining posterior end of the body has five rows of scales on each fold and they are irregularly organized. It has a brown coloration throughout. ==References== Category:Amphibian genera Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Brasilotyphlus"},{"id":"12363880","text":"Caecilia abitaguae is a species of caecilian in the family Caeciliidae.

It is found in tropical to warm temperate parts of the Indo-Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, where it feeds on sponges. ==Description== The umbrella slug is a large mollusc growing to a length of up to , with a relatively small external shell on the dorsal surface. This shell is a flattish cone and is usually encrusted with epiphytic organisms, both plant and animal. The mantle is roughly circular in outline, and is covered with pustules; the ground colour of the mantle varies, usually being orange or brownish, and the pustules are usually white. The mollusc does not elongate when crawling and the location of the head is revealed when it thrusts out its rolled rhinophores from beneath the shell. At the base of the rhinophores are a pair of eyes, and beneath is a cleft which contains the mouth. The radula is broad and is armed with many small teeth. The sole of the foot is smooth and flat; the gills are bipinnate and are located in the right side of the body. ==Distribution and habitat== The umbrella slug is found in the Pacific Ocean in both the tropics and in warm temperate regions. Its range includes Indonesia, Australia, New Zealand, Hawaii, Mexico and Panama. It also occurs in the Red Sea, the Mediterranean Sea and the warmer parts of the Atlantic Ocean. In 2016, researchers reported that it had been observed for the first time in the Bay of Biscay in surveys undertaken between 2011 and 2014, in what seemed to be a northward shift in its range; this \\"tropicalisation\\" was attributed to a rise in sea temperature. It occurs in both shallow water and at depths down to about . ==Ecology== The umbrella slug feeds on sponges and its colouring often makes it well camouflaged. It rasps the surface of the sponge with its radula, opening the cleft on its base wide so that it can press its mouth against the surface of the sponge. This slug has been found on Tethya spp., Aaptos aaptos, Ancorina alata and Plakina trilopha. The eggs are laid in a long, coiled ribbon and the larvae are planktonic. ==Gallery== File:Umbraculum umbraculum.jpg File:Umbraculum umbraculum R√©union.jpg File:Umbraculum umbraculum 000.jpg File:Umbraculum umbraculum 001.png File:Umbraculum umbraculum 1.jpg == References  External links == * Scheda Umbraculum mediterraneum ‚Äì Acquarioitalia.it Category:Umbraculidae Category:Molluscs of the Atlantic Ocean Category:Molluscs of the Indian Ocean Category:Molluscs of the Pacific Ocean Category:Molluscs of the Mediterranean Sea Category:Molluscs described in 1786 ","title":"Umbrella slug"},{"id":"12363930","text":"Caecilia disossea is a species of caecilian in the family Caeciliidae.

The body is partly covered by scales. Coloration is light brown, turning into grayish brown laterally. The head is grayish. ==Habitat and conservation== There is no habitat data for the type series. The Mato Grosso records are from the Amazon biome or from its transition zone with the Cerrado. Most of the records are from areas affected by hydropower development. In 2004 it was assessed as \\"data deficient\\" for the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. ==References== mertensi Category:Amphibians of Brazil Category:Taxa named by Edward Harrison Taylor Category:Amphibians described in 1973 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Caecilia mertensi"},{"id":"12363973","text":"Caecilia nigricans, commonly known as the Rio Lita caecilian, is a species of amphibian in the family Caeciliidae.

At the end of 1991‚Äì92, he achieved promotion to Segunda Divisi√≥n with CA Marbella; in the following season, he scored a career-best seven goals to help the team to a comfortable seventh-place finish.

In the following campaign he featured relatively less ‚Äì Kre≈°iƒá was also fired in the final stretch, being replaced by Lorenzo Serra Ferrer as the side eventually finished third; his first game in the Spanish top flight took place on 18 September 1994 when he came on as a 55th-minute substitute for Alexis Trujillo in a 0‚Äì1 away loss against Athletic Bilbao, and his maiden goal in the competition occurred on 6 November in a 1‚Äì1 home draw to Valencia CF.

In 1996‚Äì97 he netted five times in the league, including a solo effort in the Seville derby which concluded a 3‚Äì0 away triumph over Sevilla FC; during his spell, he was affectionately known as Monsignor by fans due to the lack of hair in his crown. Aged 30, Ol√≠as returned to the second tier in 1999, signing with UD Las Palmas and again reuniting with Kre≈°iƒá (as well as former Betis teammates Robert Jarni and Jaime Quesada). With 37 matches and five goals from the player in his first season, another promotion befell. Subsequently, Ol√≠as began to deal with injury problems, which aggravated at his next club Levante UD.

It is found in northeastern Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, and southeastern Brazil. The common name Argentine caecilian has been coined for it. ==Description== Chthonerpeton indistinctum is a snakelike amphibian with no limbs. It can grow to about . The body has 70 to 80 transverse folds, giving it a segmented appearance. The head has a pair of sensory tentacles between the nostrils and the eyes, and this area of skin is white. The body is black above and dark grey beneath, both with tiny white flecks. The flat, disc-like area surrounding the cloaca is creamy white. ==Distribution and habitat== C. indistinctum is found in Paraguay, Uruguay, Brazil and Argentina at altitudes ranging up to . It is partially terrestrial and partly aquatic, possibly having annual migrations. When on land, it mostly stays close to the river bank, but occasionally ventures some way from water. Occasionally, it gets washed out to sea on mats of vegetation and has been found alive in the brackish water of estuaries. It is a common species, sometimes occurring in very large numbers, and the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species lists it as being of \\"Least Concern\\". ==Biology== This species is viviparous, giving birth to live young. It is considered to have several characteristics which indicate it is more primitive than other, more highly derived species. As caecilians evolved, their chromosomes are thought to have reduced in number. A number of species were karyotyped, and C. indistinctum was found to have a diploid number of 20 as against one of 28 for the more derived Typhlonectes compressicauda, an unexpected result. Further study is expected to clarify the taxonomic relationships between different species of caecilians. ==References== indistinctum Category:Amphibians of Argentina Category:Amphibians of Brazil Category:Amphibians of Paraguay Category:Amphibians of Uruguay Category:Amphibians described in 1862 Category:Taxa named by Christian Frederik L√ºtken Category:Taxa named by Johannes Theodor Reinhardt Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Chthonerpeton indistinctum"},{"id":"12364070","text":"Chthonerpeton noctinectes is a species of amphibian in the family Typhlonectidae, endemic to Brazil.

During the 16th and 17th centuries, lamaseries were built throughout the country as temples which were later enlarged to accommodate a growing number of worshipers. Mongolian architects designed their temples with six and twelve angles and pyramidal roofs approximating the yurt's round shape. Further expansion led to a quadratic shape in the design of the temples, with roofs in the shape of pole marquees. Trellis walls, roof poles and layers of felt were eventually replaced by stone, brick beams and planks. Mongolian artist and art historian N. Chultem identified three styles of traditional Mongolian architecture (Mongolian, Tibetan and Chinese), alone or in combination. Batu- Tsagaan (1654), designed by Zanabazar, was an early quadratic temple. The Dashchoilin Khiid monastery in Ulaanbaatar is an example of yurt-style architecture. The 18th century Lavrin Temple in the Erdene Zuu lamasery was built in the Tibetan tradition. The Choijin Lama S√ºm temple (1904), now a museum, is an example of a temple built in the Chinese tradition. The quadratic Tsogchin Temple, in Ulaanbaatar's Gandan monastery, combines Mongolian and Chinese traditions. The Maitreya Temple (demolished in 1938) was an example of Tibeto-Mongolian architecture. The Dashchoilin Khiid monastery has begun a project to restore this temple and the sculpture of Maitreya. Indian influences can also be seen in Mongolian architecture, especially in the design of Buddhist stupas. ==Ancient period== The Xiongnu confederation ruled present-day Mongolia from the third century BCE through the first century CE, living in portable, round tents on carts and round yurts. The Xiongnu aristocracy lived in small palaces, and their villages were protected by huge walls. S. I. Rudenko also mentions capital construction built of logs. Archaeological excavations indicate that the Xiongnu had towns; their chief city was Luut Hot (Dragon City). Powerful states developed by Turkic and Uighur tribes from the sixth through ninth centuries dominated the region. and there were several Turkic cities and towns in the Orkhon, Tuul and Selenga River valleys. The main city of the Turkic Khaganate was Balyklyk. The Uyghur Khaganate which succeeded the Turks centred on the city of Kara Balgasun, founded during the early eighth century. A portion of the -high fortress wall with a watchtower has been preserved. A large craft trading district existed in the city, whose architecture was influenced by Sogdian and Chinese traditions. Archaeological excavations uncovered traces of cities from the 10th- to 12th-century Kidan period. The most significant excavated city was Hatun Hot, founded in 944. Another significant Kidan city was Bars-Hot in the Kherlen River valley, which covered an area of . The city was surrounded with mud walls which are now thick and high.

In Mongolian, a yurt is known as a \\"ger\\" (–≥—ç—Ä). During the 12th and 13th centuries, ger-tereg (yurts on carts) were built for rulers. Large iron bushings for cartwheel axles were found during excavations at Karakorum. Axle length was over , and the cart was pulled by 22 oxen. Such ger-teregs are mentioned in the Secret History of the Mongols. Medieval yurt camps were commonly arranged in a huree (circle), with the leader's yurt in the centre. Hurees were replaced by an ail (neighbourhood) arrangement in the 13th and 14th centuries during the Mongol Khanate and the end of internal strife. After the 15th-century disintegration of the khanate, the huree was the basic layout of monasteries (which were initially mobile). Another type of monastery layout, khiid (following the Tibetan arrangement) was used during the 16th and 17th centuries when Buddhism was re-introduced to the region. As huree monasteries and camps developed into towns and cities, their names retained the word huree (for example, Niislel Huree and Zasagtu Khaan-u Huree). Roofs originally had steeper slopes, with a rim around the center opening to allow smoke from central, open fires to vent. During the 18th and 19th centuries, enclosed stoves with chimneys (zuuh) were introduced; this permitted a simpler design, with a lower silhouette. Another relatively-recent development is an additional layer of canvas for rain protection. The organization and furnishings of the interior space mirror family roles and spiritual concepts. Each cardinal direction is significant, and the door always faces south. Herders use the sun's position in the crown of the yurt as a sundial. Yurts have been used in Central Asia for thousands of years. In Mongolia they have influenced other architectural forms, particularly temples. Between 30 and 40 percent of the population live in yurts, many in city suburbs. ==Tents== Recreation of a Mongolian tent Tents played a role in the development of Mongolian architecture, and these temporary shelters were frequently used under pastoral conditions. Tents were erected for Naadam, feasts and other gatherings. Jodgor is a small tent, accommodating one or two people. Maihan is a larger tent for a group. Tsatsar is a fabric shade on vertical supports, replacing a wall. Tsachir is a large, rectangular tent with vertical fabric walls, and Asar is a generic name for tsatsar and tsachir. Giovanni da Pian del Carpine's book, Ystoria Mongalorum (History of the Mongols), reported that during the 1246 enthronement ceremony for Guyuk Khaan a tent with a capacity of 2,000 people was erected on the Tamir River. The marquee was supported by pillars decorated with gold leaves, and the internal side of the walls were covered with canopy. Later designs of many temples were based on tsachir. ==Imperial period== 18th-century drawing of Silver Tree fountain in front of Tumen Amugulang Palace The remains of the Mongol Empire capital, Karakorum, were first rediscovered and studied by S. V. Kiselev. Karakorum, in the Orkhon River valley, was founded by Genghis Khan in 1220 as a military centre; in 15 years, it also became an administrative and cultural centre of the empire. The Tumen Amugulang palace (palace of the Great Khan) was in the centre of the city. Based on the records of William of Rubruck, most scholars believe that a silver, tree-shaped fountain stood in front of the palace; however, according to others the fountain was inside the palace. According to Rubruck, four silver lions stood at the foot of the Silver Tree and fermented mare's milk (airag, a favourite Mongol drink) flowed from their mouths. Four golden serpents twined around the tree. bixi) at Karakorum Wine ran from the mouth of one serpent, airag from the second serpent, mead from the third and rice wine from the fourth. At the top of the tree, an angel blew a bugle. The tree's branches, leaves and fruits were made of silver. It was designed by a captive sculptor, William of Paris. The khan sat on a throne in the north end of the yard, in front of the palace. Excavations partially confirmed the description, and the buildings were heated by smoke pipes installed under the floors. The khan's palace was built on a platform. Genghis Khan's son, √ñgedei, ordered his brothers, sons and other princes to build palaces in Karakorum. The city contained Buddhist temples, Christian churches and Muslim mosques. There were sculptures of tortoises at each gate of the four-sided, walled city. Steles on the tortoises' backs were topped with beacons for travellers in the steppe. Karakorun's construction was supervised by Otchigin, youngest brother of Genghis Khan. Artifacts from the 13th-century palace in Karakorum Other cities and palaces existed throughout Mongolia during the 13th and 14th centuries. Best-studied are the ruins of Palace Aurug, near Kerulen, and the cities of Hirhira and Kondui in the trans-Baikal region. The latter two indicate that cities developed not only around the khans' palaces but also around the homes of other nobility; Hirhira developed around the residence of Juchi-Khasar. The Mongolian nobility, dissatisfied with temporary residences, began to build luxurious palaces. The palace in Hirhira was inside a citadel. The palace in Kondui was built on a platform surrounded by double-tiered terraces, pavilions and pools. The archeological excavations revealed evidence of burning; all three cities fell during the late 14th century, when the Chinese army raided the region and looted the cities. Karakorum, destroyed in 1380, never restored its previous glory. Wars waged by China continued from 1372 to 1422, halting Mongolia's cultural progress during the imperial period. The region experienced a dark age until the second half of the 16th century, when a renaissance began. ==Renaissance== Zuu Temple at Erdene Zuu monastery After two centuries of cultural decline, Mongolia began a renaissance during the second half of the 16th century. This was a period of relative peace, free of foreign aggression, and the Gelug school of Buddhism was introduced. Altan Khan of Tumet founded the city of Hohhot in 1575 as a political and cultural centre. Among the first Buddhist monasteries in Mongolia during this period was temple Thegchen Chonchor Ling in Kh√∂kh Nuur, built by Altan Khan to commemorate his 1577 meeting with third Dalai Lama Sonam Gyatso. Many temples were built in Hohhot during the period including Dazhao and Xilituzhao Temples. Erdene Zuu walls In Khalkha, Abatai Khan founded the Erdene Zuu monastery in 1585 near the site of Karakorum. Although these first temples were designed in the Chinese style, Mongolian architecture developed a unique style with Tibetan and Indian influences. The Mongolian style began with mobile temples. As the people became more sedentary, the temples evolved into multi-angular and quadratic structures. The roof, supported by pillars and walls, served also as the ceiling. Stupa at Erdene Zuu monastery Zanabazar, the first Bogd Gegeen of the Khalkha Mongols, designed many temples and monasteries in traditional Mongolian style and supervised their construction. He merged Oriental architecture with the designs of Mongolian yurts and marquees. Zanabazar's Batu-Tsagaan Tsogchin temple in Ulan Bator was a prototype of the Mongolian architectural style. A large, marquee-shaped structure, its four central columns support the roof. There are 12 columns in the middle row; those in the outer row are slightly taller, and the total number of columns is 108. The temple, designed for expansion, was originally and later expanded to . The Indian style was most prominent in stupa design. Among the best-known stupas are Ikh Tamir, Altan Suburgan of Erdene Zuu, Jiran Khashir of Gandang and the mausoleums of Abatai Khan and T√ºsheetu Khan Gombodorji. The Kh√∂gn√∂ Tarni (1600), Zaya-iin Kh√ºree (1616), Baruun Kh√ºree (1647) and Zaya-iin Khiid (1654) monasteries were built during this period. ==Post-renaissance== Construction of temples in the renaissance tradition continued into the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries. Ishbaljir (1709‚Äì1788) compared building proportions to the proportions of the human body in Exquisite Flower Beads, and Agvaanhaidav (1779‚Äì1838) described the process of building a Maitreya temple. Agvaanceren (1785‚Äì1849) wrote Aahar shaahar (Building and Repairing Temples). Translations of the Kangyur were also used by Mongolian architects. The Z√º√ºn Huree (1711), Amarbayasgalant (1727) and Manjusri Hiid (1733) monasteries were built during this period. The mobile monastery Ihe Huree, founded for Zanabazar, settled at its present Ulaanbaatar location in 1779. The wall around Erdene Yuu monastery, with 108 stupas, began construction in 1734. The temple of the boddhisattva Avalokiteshvara was built from 1911 to 1913 as a symbol of the new, independent Bogdo Khanate of Mongolia. The statue of the boddhisattva, believed to opens the eyes of wisdom in sentient beings, symbolised the Mongolian people's step into modern civilisation. In the beginning of the 20th century, there were about 800 monasteries throughout the country. The experimental practice of combining traditional Asian architecture with Russian architecture was explored. The Bogd Khan had his winter palace built as a Russian horomy. Another example of the combining of Asian and Russian styles is the residence of Khanddorji Wang, a leader of the Mongolian Revolution of 1911. The body of the building is designed as a Russian house, and the top was designed in the Asian style. One of the first European buildings in Mongolia is the 2-storey building housing Zanabazar Museum of Fine Arts, built as a trade centre in 1905.

The constructivist architecture which flourished in the Soviet Union also took root in Mongolia. The Radio and Postal Communications Committee building, with its pyramid-topped tower, was an example of constructivism. Other examples were the Mongoltrans offices, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Military Club. ==Classicism and mass production== Downtown Ulaanbaatar was designed by Soviet architects, who developed classicism as Stalinist architecture. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the State University, Government House, the Opera House and the State Library exemplify European classicism. Ulaanbaatar's National Theatre Mongolian architects worked to creatively combine this neoclassicism with traditional Mongolian architecture. The development of downtown Ulaanbaatar continued at the initiative of B. Chimed, who designed the National Theatre, the Natural History Museum and the Ulaanbaatar Hotel. The theatre has the quadratic plane and double-tier marquee roof of Mongolian architecture; it and his other buildings Chimed's use of indigenous traditions in contemporary architecture. This direction was followed by other architects; the Urt Tsagaan (Tourists' Walk) and Ministry of Health by B. Dambiinyam and the Astronomical Observatory, State University Building #2 and Meteorology Building by A. Hishigt are distinct from European architecture. Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ulaanbaatar's Peace Bridge Mongolian architecture was dictated by economy and mass production during the Nikita Khrushchev and Leonid Brezhnev eras in the Soviet Union. The early 1960s were characterised by increased Soviet and Chinese investment due to their competition for Mongolian influence, and the competition resulted in accelerated development. The older districts south of the Middle River (Dund gol) and the Peace Bridge were built by Chinese workers. The architecture of the 1960s and 1970s included monotonous four-, five- and nine-storey apartment blocks with simple rectangular shapes, dictated by the need for cheap, speedy construction. Hostility between the Soviet Union and China forced Mongolia to take sides, and the country allied with the former (leading to increased Soviet investment). Apartment districts were built around Ulaanbaatar, including south of the Dund gol river, often by Soviet soldiers. New cities were built (Darkhan, Erdenet and Baganuur) during this period. Brezhnev's 1974 visit was followed by modern housing in Ulaanbaatar's Bayangol district. The housing consists of nine-storey apartment blocks and five V-shaped 12-storey buildings on Ayush Street, similar to Kalinin Avenue in the centre of Moscow. This street is the city's busiest shopping centre. The monotony of urban architecture was criticised at four successive congresses of the Mongolian Association of Architects beginning in 1972, but no significant improvement was achieved. The early 1980s brought new public buildings, such as the Lenin Museum and the Yalalt Cinema (now the Tengis). The Ethnographical Museum, in the centre of Ulaanbaatar's amusement park, was designed as a Mongolian castle surrounded by walls on an island in an artificial lake. The winter house of the international children's Nairamdal camp was designed as an ocean liner travelling in a sea of mountains. One of the largest monuments of the socialist period is the Palace of Culture. Although it has elements of Mongolian architecture, its basic design is also found in the capitals of many former socialist countries. Amid a vision of replacing yurts with apartment blocks, the yurt districts were seen as temporary, transient housing. Under socialism the state made little or no effort (except for bathhouses) to develop the yurt districts, which became Mongolian shanty towns. ==Modern period== Perestroika and the transition to democracy induced interest in traditional history and culture and free thinking in the arts and architecture. Nearly the entire population of Mongolia donated toward repairs to the Chenrezig temple in the Gandan Tegchinling monastery and the re-casting of the statue of Boddhisattva Avalokiteshvara. A group of artists and architects led by the actor Bold, an enthusiast for traditional architecture, developed a project to make Ulaanbaatar an Asian city. They began building traditional gates and shades in the Street of Revolutionaries and other streets and in the amusement park. Although the project ended at the beginning of the 1998 Russian financial crisis, Mongolia's Buddhist sangha continued restoring and founding monasteries. Modern architecture returned as the economy began to recover from the financial crisis. The completion of the tall glass Ardiin Bank building (now hosting the Ulaanbaatar Bank) and the glass Chinggis Khan Hotel complex during the second half of 1990s marked the beginning of a new age in Mongolian architecture. The Bodhi Tower, built in 2004, consists of two buildings. The one facing S√ºkhbaatar Square is a four- storey classical building which harmonises with the surrounding 1950s architecture. A high-rise tower, the other building, faces the back street; a similar principle was used in the design of the previous period's Palace of Culture. Another contemporary building is Ulaanbaatar's Narantuul Tower. Hotel Mongolia, in the city's Bayanz√ºrkh district, has a silver-tree fountain at its centre reminiscent of Karakorum. Prime Minister Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj appointed a group of professionals to develop a project for a new city at Karakorum. According to the prime minister, the new city would become the capital of Mongolia. After his resignation and the appointment of Miyeegombyn Enkhbold as prime minister, the project was abandoned.

It is found in Mexico and Central America, where it burrows under leaf litter and plant debris. ==Description== The adult Mexican burrowing caecilian grows to a length of . In general appearance, it resembles a large earthworm. Around a hundred transverse annular folds in the skin give the appearance of segments. The head has a pointed snout, a single row of teeth in the lower jaw, and two vestigial eyes covered with skin, with a pair of protrusible tentacles between the eyes and the nostrils. The body is elongated and there are no limbs. The upper surface is dark grey and the under surface pale grey with darker markings on the annuli. ==Distribution and habitat== The Mexican burrowing caecilian is found in Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and possibly Belize, mostly on the Atlantic side, but also in some isolated parts of the Pacific slope. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical dry forests, moist lowland forests, moist montane forests, plantations, rural gardens, and heavily degraded former forests. It is fossorial, living in damp, loose soil and under leaf litter, logs, and plant debris, often in banana and coffee plantations. It is found at altitudes of up to above sea level. ==Biology== The Mexican burrowing caecilian feeds on invertebrates, including earthworms, termites, crickets, slugs, and snails. It emerges onto the ground surface on nights with light rainfall and catches small prey that come within its reach. Larger individuals may eat mice and small lizards. It moves by internal concertina-like movements and by undulating its body from side to side. This caecilian is viviparous. Fertilisation is internal and up to 16 developing larvae subsist on the yolks of their eggs for three months. Then, they develop rasping teeth and feed on maternal glandular secretions, scraping the inside of the oviduct to stimulate their production. When they emerge, after 11 months of gestation, they are long. They then shed their larval teeth and rapidly grow a set of adult ones. ==Status== The Mexican burrowing caecilian is listed as least concern in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. It has several disjunct populations, and in areas where it used to be abundant it now seems to be less common, and the locations in which it is found seem to be fewer in number.

A conflict arose between the citizenry of the Flemish provinces who wished to engage with the authorities in Dutch, and the largely francophone aristocracy of the southern provinces which became modern- day Belgium. While the Belgian Constitution guaranteed \\"freedom of language\\", in practice the authorities, including government institutions such as the courts, were dominated by the French-speaking upper classes, and operated in French. This bias disadvantaged the largely Flemish North and, to a lesser degree, the Walloons of the South and the mainly German- or Luxembourgish- speaking environs of Arlon. As universal education developed in Belgium, the French language was initially the sole medium of instruction, alienating the northern half of the country. There was a similar sense of alienation in other areas such as justice, as the trial and conviction of two Flemish labourers, Jan Coucke and Pieter Goethals, in 1860 demonstrated. The pair were sentenced to death for the murder of a widow without having understood one single word of their trial, and were then found to be innocent after they were executed. The Flemish Movement started to advocate language legislation that would recognise Dutch as an official language. ==1873: First law on the use of languages== The first law on the use of languages was voted on in 1873, perhaps influenced by growing public dissent occasioned by cases such as the 1872 case of Jozef Schoep. He refused to pay a fine of 50 francs for not wanting to declare the birth of his son to the municipal administration of Molenbeek in French, only to be convicted after an appeal in Cassation. This and other cases provoked the discussions about the use of languages, and the first law on the use of languages, supported by Edward Coremans, regulated the use of languages in the courts in Flanders. Dutch became the major language in Flanders, but oral testimony and penal action were still permitted in French. ==1878: Second law on the use of languages== The second law on the use of languages in 1878 regulated the use of language in the administrations of Flanders and Brussels. Announcements to the public by government officials had to be made either in Dutch or in both languages. Correspondence with municipalities or persons would be in Dutch unless a person expressed a wish to be engaged in French, but in reality the law was hardly applied in daily life: Flemish citizens were still obliged to communicate with the administration in French, because most civil servants were monoglots who either spoke only French or refused to use the Dutch language. ==1883: Third law on the use of languages== Until 1883, education in secondary schools had been entirely in French. The third law on the use of languages was voted on in order to introduce bilingual education. ==1898: Law on Equality== In 1898, the Law on Equality was introduced. Dutch and French were now to be regarded as co-equal official languages but native French speakers in parliament, unwilling to learn or use Dutch, were either unable or unwilling to read the Dutch texts they were supposed to vote on. The reverse was not the case: Dutch speakers were obliged to learn French.) Nevertheless, under pressure from the general population, the law was passed, largely due to the extension of suffrage to every male citizen aged 25 and above which increased the number of Flemish voters, and the introduction of plural voting in 1893 which allowed some eligible voters to cast more than one vote. ==1921: A bilingual nation or languages linked to a region== Disagreement over the country's language policy continued. Some segments of French-speaking Wallonia were concerned that current practices could result in Belgium becoming a bilingual country, with French and Dutch being recognised as official languages everywhere. This led to a proposal to split the administration in Belgium to preserve the French- speaking nature of Wallonia and to avoid the possibility that French-speaking civil servants there might have to pass a Dutch language examination. This implied a choice: should Belgium become a bilingual country or a country with two language regions? This was expressed in two alternatives: * Personality principle: All citizens have the freedom to address the authorities in whichever Belgian language they choose, regardless of their region of residence. * Territoriality principle: The official language in a particular region follows restricted language boundaries, which means that all official dealings with the authorities will take place in the language of the region.Stefaan van der Jeught, Territoriality and freedom of language: the case of Belgium, Current Issues in Language Planning (2016), https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14664208.2016.1243883 In 1921, the principle of territoriality was chosen; it was confirmed by further legislation, with landmark laws passed in 1932 and 1962. The language areas were outlined according to the principle of the language of the majority of the population, and a provision in the 1932 law determined that a language census should be conducted every ten years: a municipality could change its linguistic status only according to the findings of the census. This more flexible approach opened the possibility of minorities representing a minimum 30% of the local population being able to obtain services in their native, or chosen, language. ==1962: Establishment of the language areas and facilities== A 1962 law determined which municipality belonged to what language area. Each Belgian municipality is restricted to one language area, of which there are four: Dutch, French, German, and the bilingual area Brussels-Capital that includes the Belgian capital city and eighteen surrounding municipalities. From then on, modifications of the linguistic regime would be possible only after changing the law, which required a majority of each language community. In that same year, the municipality of Voeren (Fourons) went to the Dutch- speaking province of Limburg, and Comines (Komen) and Mouscron (Moeskroen) to the French-speaking province of Hainaut. These and several other municipalities obtained facilities for the minority language group. In a municipality with a minority speaking another official language, facilities were provided for registered residents speaking that language. For example, education in an alternative official language was made available as long as sixteen or more parents requested its provision. (However a resident of a municipality has no such rights in any neighbouring municipality.) To benefit from these facilities, they must be asked for by the person concerned. This raised the issue of whether the facilities had to be requested on each and every occasion or whether a single request conferred a blanket benefit. In 1997 the Peeters directive required that inhabitants of such municipalities must request such facilities in their chosen language on each and every occasion they want to enjoy that right. This led to a crisis in Voeren surrounding the mayor, Jos√© Happart. Protests raised by French-speakers before the European Court of Human Rights ECtHR were mostly unsuccessful (e.g. Belgian Linguistics Case), a number of institutions such as the Catholic University of Leuven obtained authorisation to become bilingual. ==1970: insertion of the language areas into the Constitution== In 1970, on the completion of the first state reform, four language areas were established by Article 4 of the Constitution. Since then the language affiliation of municipalities can be changed only by special law. At the same time language communities were established, with the Flemish and French Communities being responsible for the regulation of the use of languages in their language area in the areas of administration, education, and for interactions between employers and their workforce. ==The present day== Currently the language used by the Belgian authorities, administration, education, businesses, and the army is determined by the courts. The constitutional right of freedom of language remains intact and absolute only in the home, leading to ongoing tensions in Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde.  Railway information  Bilingual information at a railway station in Brussels The National Railway Company of Belgium's policy is to provide information on the train in the language of the region. For example, on a train travelling from Antwerp to Charleroi, announcements are made first in Dutch (in the Flemish Region), then in French and Dutch (in the Brussels-Capital Region), again in Dutch and finally in French in Wallonia. Station announcements at Eupen and Hergenrath, the two stations in the German-speaking community, are made in German and French (in that order). This requires rail travellers to be conversant with the name of their destination in both languages (though on-board ticket inspectors are bound to respond in either language). In and around international stations, such as Brussels Airport, Dutch and French announcements are supplemented by announcements in German and English.  Road signs  As mentioned above, road signs are required to give destinations only in the local language, requiring travellers to recognise their ultimate and intermediate destinations in multiple languages. For example, on the Belgian portion of the E40 motorway, westbound travellers to Li√®ge are directed to L√ºttich and eastbound travellers are directed to Luik, but signs near the city itself refer only to Li√®ge. == See also == * Communities, regions and language areas of Belgium * State reform in Belgium * Street name controversy * Frenchification of Brussels ==References== *This article originated as a translation of the article on the Dutch-language Wikipedia. ==External links== *Omzendbrief- Peeters Category:Belgian legislation Category:Legal history of Belgium Category:Politics of Belgium Category:Political history of Belgium Belgium Category:Languages of Belgium Category:Bilingualism in Belgium Belgium ","title":"Language legislation in Belgium"},{"id":"12364253","text":"Polcast Television is a TV broadcaster of four Polish channels: Tele 5, Polonia 1, Water Planet and Novela TV.

He is currently the editor of Inside TV, the television section of Inside Soap magazine. A former pupil of Bristol Cathedral School, he was, for ten years, editor of Doctor Who Magazine (DWM). ==TV Zone and Visual Imagination== Spilsbury started his career in journalism with Visual Imagination in 1999, where he contributed to many of the company's publications, including TV Zone,, Starburst, Shivers, Film Review, Ultimate DVD, and Cult Times.. He was then promoted to editor of TV Zone in 2001, which he edited for two years until 2003. ==Doctor Who Magazine== Spilsbury joined Doctor Who Magazine in March 2003,http://www.drwho-online.co.uk/features/interviews/tom- spilsbury.aspx on Issue 330, becoming deputy editor to Clayton Hickman. He later took over from Hickman as editor in August 2007, with Issue 387. He redesigned and revamped the magazine with Issue 390, persuading Kylie Minogue to pose with a Dalek for the cover of the new look magazine in December 2007. Spilsbury successfully negotiated with The Sun newspaper to run the photograph over a full-page on the day of the magazine's publication.The Sun Retrieved December 12, 2007 Spilsbury later became the first person to clock up 100 consecutive issues on DWM's staff with Issue 429 in December 2010, and later became the longest-serving editor of the title, overtaking Hickman in May 2013, and editing his 100th edition with Issue 486 in April 2015. He also oversaw the 500th issue of the magazine, and recreated the cover of the very first issue, explaining that he wanted 'something which somehow paid tribute to the past, as well as celebrating the present.' Reflecting on his long tenure on the magazine, Spilsbury said that \\"I just enjoy being a magazine editor. So I'd happily be a magazine editor for a different magazine! I don't suppose I'll be editing Doctor Who Magazine for the rest of my life\\" and noted that \\"you must never get complacent about it. Never ever think that these are the only people buying it.\\" While editing the magazine, Spilsbury interviewed subjects such as Freema Agyeman (Issues 392 and 393), Nicholas Courtney (Issue 402), Graeme Harper (Issues 380 and 392), and Steven Moffat (Issues 417/418, 447, 468/469, 484 and 515), amongst others. He also served as co-editor of the magazine's comic strip with Scott Gray, and wrote the regular Public Image column, which reports on the series' ratings, which he has continued to provide since his departure as editor. Spilsbury has admitted to being greatly influenced by Radio Times, paying tribute to covers of the listings magazine on several occasions. In 2015 Spilsbury appeared on BBC Worldwide's Doctor Who: The Fan Show, where he was complimentary about the episode The Witch's Familiar, and confirmed that the story he first remembered watching was Destiny of the Daleks A further episode in 2016 saw Spilsbury and his team appear as themselves in a spoof documentary, showing the production of Issue 500 of DWM. On 12 July 2017 Panini UK announced Tom Spilsbury was stepping down as Doctor Who Magazine's editor after Issue 515 and would be succeeded by Marcus Hearn. ==Inside Soap== Spilsbury's first freelance work for Inside Soap magazine was an interview with director Graeme Harper in November 2010, about the tram crash seen in the 50th anniversary episodes of Coronation Street,. Since leaving Doctor Who Magazine in 2017, Spilsbury has mainly worked for Inside Soap, initially contributing as a writer, before joining the full-time staff in 2018 as a regular writer and sub-editor, contributing stories on EastEnders, Coronation Street, Emmerdale and Hollyoaks. In March 2020, he took over editing Inside TV, the television section of the magazine, providing features on Red Dwarf , We Hunt Together , and Alan Carr's Epic Gameshow , among others. ==Other magazines== Spilsbury has occasionally contributed freelance articles to other magazines, including SFX features on Jean-Luc Picard of Star Trek in issue 324 (published February 2020) and an interview with Carole Ann Ford in issue 327 (published May 2020). ==Doctor Who DVD appearances== Spilsbury was a regular contributor to BBC Worldwide/2 entertain Ltd's Doctor Who DVD range, appearing as a talking head on documentaries for the Region 2 DVD releases of The Androids of Tara and The Armageddon Factor in 2007, The Rescue, The Deadly Assassin, The War Games and Enlightenment in 2009, Doctor Who (Doctor Who: The Movie) in 2010, and Inferno in 2013 ‚Äì on which he appeared talking about the 'Other Eighth Doctor', David Burton, who allegedly made a new series of Doctor Who in the early 1990s, despite there being no photographic evidence of the production ever having been made. Spilsbury wryly noted that Burton's main claim to fame seemed to be that he possessed a car with the words 'the new Doctor Who' written on the side ‚Äì but pointed out that anyone could have put that on the side of their car! ==Television and Radio appearances== Spilsbury has often been called on as a Doctor Who expert, appearing on BBC News and BBC Breakfast on several occasions. He was called on to comment on the departure of Matt Smith by BBC News on 1 June 2013, where he was asked about the controversial 'regeneration limit' of only 13 Doctors being allowed. Spilsbury commented that the writers had \\"just made that up,\\" and so the writers could \\"make up something else.\\" He later appeared in a discussion on BBC Breakfast over the identity of the new Doctor, revealed on 4 August 2013. When asked by presenter Naga Munchetty who he thought might be in the frame, Spilsbury praised names such as Olivia Colman. He also quipped that the reveal of a new Doctor was \\"like the Royal baby for sci-fi fans,\\" with all the same speculation as to whether it would be a boy or a girl. When pushed who he thought would be cast, Spilsbury remained on the fence, confirming that he was as in the dark over the new Doctor's identity as everyone else. He stated that he wouldn't be surprised if a woman was cast in the role in the future, but doubted it would happen on this occasion. The same day he was the special guest on the BBC Radio Manchester show hosted by Eamon O'Neill and Jimmy Wagg, where they discussed the arrival of the new Doctor, and Tom suggested that he might be keeping it secret because he himself had taken the job! Later that evening, Peter Capaldi was revealed as the Twelfth Doctor. The next morning, Spilsbury was widely quoted saying that Capaldi \\"was brilliant already.\\" A year later, when Capaldi made his full d√©but as the Doctor in August 2014, Spilsbury returned to BBC Breakfast to give his full verdict, giving the new Doctor a thumbs up. BBC Radio Wales interviewed Spilsbury about the imminent series 10 of Doctor Who on 30 March 2017. When Jodie Whittaker was cast as the Thirteenth Doctor in July 2017, Spilsbury appeared on numerous BBC local radio programmes to talk about her casting. He was challenged by Nicholas Pegg to include a William Hartnell-era episode title into each interview without the presenter noticing. Spilsbury accepted the challenge, culminating with the unlikely observation on BBC Radio Suffolk that Whittaker was like a Rider from Shang-Tu On 29 May 2012, he appeared in La Nuit Doctor Who, a television documentary for the French channel France 4. On stage, Spilsbury hosted the Doctor Who Night at Cin√© Lumiere on 19 January 2013, interviewing Toby Whithouse about his writing career. In May 2018, Spilsbury hosted the first ever on-screen joint interview with former Doctor Who showrunners Russell T Davies and Steven Moffat for the BBC's official Doctor Who YouTube channel, as the two writers talked about their book adaptations of Rose and The Day of the Doctor. In June 2018, he took part on a panel of Doctor Who experts to introduce a new audience to the 1963-89 run of the series, which was streaming on Twitch. ==Newspaper interviews== As a commentator on Doctor Who (he was assistant editor of Doctor Who Magazine at the time), Spilsbury was among the first to get to see the relaunch of the show in 2005. He commented on the revival starring Christopher Eccleston and Billie Piper to The Guardian, saying \\"I really enjoyed it. Chris and Billie were great. It was great to see everyone else enjoying it. They laughed at the funny bits and were scared by the scary bits. It bodes very well for the series. I think kids will love it. It's exactly the sort of thing I fell in love with as a child. Christopher Eccleston still feels like a Doctor Who. He'll be looked back on by kids in 20 years' time as their doctor.\\" In September 2015, Spilsbury was again interviewed by The Guardian about the new series of Doctor Who, commenting \\"I think it's a stronger run than last year. There are more two-part stories than we've had recently, which means the whole pace of the storytelling is a bit different. They've shaken it up, which is quite exciting.\\" Bowie, the Doctor will see you now The Guardian Retrieved 12 September 2015 ==Popular culture== In the 50th anniversary Doctor Who story The Day of the Doctor the character of Coal Hill School teacher Tom (played by Tristan Beint) was named after Tom Spilsbury, a tribute by his close friend and writer of the episode Steven Moffat.The Fact of Fiction Doctor Who Magazine Page 82 Issue #500 July 2016.

The episode was written by Johnny Candon, who had previously written articles for Spilsbury in Doctor Who Magazine. ==Awards== In May 2012, Spilsbury accepted the Eagle Award for Favourite British Comicbook (Colour) for his editorship of Doctor Who Magazine. Doctor Who's executive producer Steven Moffat tweeted his joy: \\"Punching the air @TomSpilsbury and team with an Eagle Award for Doctor Who Magazine! AMAZING!\\" Spilsbury himself tweeted his shock: \\"OH MY GOD, WE WON!!!\\" In May 2016, Spilsbury accepted the certificate from the Guinness Book of Records, on behalf of Doctor Who Magazine, of World Record for the longest-running magazine based on a TV series, which it had been since 2010. ==Other media== Spilsbury assisted Nicholas Pegg on his book The Complete David Bowie, and was thanked for his contribution in the book. In September 2017 Spilsbury recorded a short audio contribution to mark the official 11th YouTube anniversary of colourisation artist Stuart Humphryes. ==ReferencesExternal links== * * Tom Spilsbury on Twitter * Tom Spilsbury on YouTube * Tom Spilsbury on Instagram Category:British magazine editors Category:Living people Category:1976 births ","title":"Tom Spilsbury"},{"id":"12364323","text":"The molecular formula C6H6N2O may refer to: * Acetylpyrazine, an organic compound; a pyrazine and a ketone * Isonicotinamide, the amide form of isonicotinic acid; an isomer of nicotinamide * Nicotinamide, a form of vitamin B3 found in food, used as a dietary supplement and medication ","title":"C6H6N2O"},{"id":"12364327","text":"Oscaecilia bassleri, or Bassler's slender caecilian, is a species of caecilian in the family Caeciliidae.

Eggerth began singing during her early childhood.Fox, Margalit. \\"Marta Eggerth, 'the Callas of Operetta', Dies at 101\\", The New York Times, December 30, 2013 Her mother dedicated herself to her daughter, who was called a \\"Wunderkind\\" at the age of 11 making her theatrical debut in the operetta Mannequins. It was during this time and the years that followed that Eggerth began singing the most demanding coloratura repertoire by composers including Rossini, Meyerbeer, Offenbach and Johann Strauss II. While still a teenager, Eggerth embarked on a tour of Denmark, Holland and Sweden before arriving in Vienna at the invitation of Emmerich K√°lm√°n. K√°lm√°n invited her to Vienna to understudy Adele Kern, the famous coloratura of the Vienna State Opera, in his operetta Das Veilchen vom Montmartre (The Violet of Montmartre).

They were married in 1936 and together became known as Europe's Liebespaar (Love Pair) causing a sensation wherever they appeared. On February 10, 1938, Jan Kiepura made his debut at New York's Metropolitan Opera, singing the role of Rodolfo in Puccini's La boh√®me. He went on to sing leading roles in Tosca, Rigoletto, Carmen, Manon, and Aida, as well as performing up to 80 concerts a year throughout the United States and Canada. While Kiepura toured the United States, Eggerth was signed by the Shubert Theatre on Broadway to appear in Richard Rodgers' musical Higher and Higher. She subsequently signed a contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in Hollywood and, during the early 1940s, made two movies with Judy Garland: For Me and My Gal in 1942 (also Gene Kelly's first major film role) and Presenting Lily Mars in 1943. In Chicago, Eggerth and Kiepura performed together on the operatic stage in La boh√®me to rave reviews. In 1943, they starred together on Broadway at the Majestic Theater in a revised production of Leh√°r's The Merry Widow, with Robert Stolz conducting and choreography by George Balanchine. They would eventually perform The Merry Widow more than 2,000 times, in five languages throughout Europe and America. In 1945, they were back on Broadway together in the musical Polonaise. After World War II, they returned to France touring and making films, such as Valse Brillante (1949) and The Land of Smiles (1952), before bringing The Merry Widow to London's Palace Theatre in 1954. Throughout her career, Eggerth maintained active recital tours throughout Europe, Canada and the United States, combining her extensive repertoire of lieder, opera, film songs, and especially Viennese operetta. Kiepura's equally active recital schedule often meant that the couple would be temporarily separated. But the couple's international tours often brought them together in the same city, where they would perform to delighted crowds. In London, they gave two sold out concerts in one week at the Royal Albert Hall in 1956. The couple continued singing throughout the 1950s and 1960s with more productions of The Merry Widow in the United States, concerts and other productions in Europe. In 1965 they brought The Merry Widow back to Berlin for yet another successful run. Kiepura died in 1966. Eggerth stopped singing at this time for several years. Finally, persuaded by her mother, she decided to revive her career. In the 1970s she began to make regular television appearances, and to actively perform concerts in Europe. In 1982, she returned to the American stage to co-star in the Tom Jones/Harvey Schmidt musical Colette opposite Diana Rigg in Seattle and Denver, and later in Stephen Sondheim's Follies in Pittsburgh. In 1999, at the age of 87, she sang on the stage of the Vienna State Opera in a special televised matin√©e concert hosted by opera impresario and historian Marcel Prawy, to mark that opera house's first production of Leh√°r's The Merry Widow. She sang a medley from the operetta in four languages and received a spontaneous standing ovation. She repeated this medley in 2000, at a gala to mark the 200th anniversary of Vienna's Theater an der Wien. In 2001, Eggerth returned to London for \\"An Interview-in-Concert\\" at an absolutely sold-out Wigmore Hall, accompanied by conductor-pianist Alexander Frey and hosted by British author and critic, Brendon Carroll. She also sang at the annual Licia Albanese-Puccini Foundation concerts at Lincoln Center's Alice Tully Hall to much fanfare. She was seen in Austria on a popular television detective series, Tatort, playing the role of an ageing diva suspected in a murder case. Highlights in 2006/2007 have included two concerts with interviews at the Metropolitan Museum of Art; sold out shows at the Caf√© Sabarsky in Neue Galerie entertaining audiences with her great pre-war Viennese/Berlin cabaret style of wit, artistry and song; a concert and discussion held as part of New York University's Osher Lifelong Learning Institutes; an appearance at the Austrian Cultural Forum as part of their Mostly Operetta series; operetta master classes at the Manhattan School of Music; as well as an appearance at the Jewish Association for Services for the Aged (JASA). Her last performance was at age 99 in 2011. ==Awards== Eggerth was awarded many major artistic decorations from Austria, Germany, Poland, and Italy in recognition of her accomplishments in operetta, theatre and film. Her final recognitions included the Knights Cross of the Order of the Merit of the Republic of Poland, Knights Cross of the Order of the Merit of the Republic of Hungary, her native land's highest honour, and the Erwin Piscator Life Achievement Award for her legendary achievements. In 2003, Patria Music released a retrospective double CD of her songs entitled My Life My Song. ==Personal life== Eggerth was married to the Polish tenor Jan Kiepura. ==Death== Eggerth died on 26 December 2013 in Rye, New York. She was 101 years old. ==Films== * Csak egy kisl√°ny van a vil√°gon (1930) * Die Br√§utigamswitwe (Let's Love and Laugh, 1931) * ' (1931) * The Daredevil (1931) * A Night at the Grand Hotel (1931) * Modern Dowry (1932) * Where Is This Lady?

The most unusual feature of the gun was its tracked carriage, shared by a number of Soviet heavy artillery systems of the interwar period. Despite a number of drawbacks, most notably limited mobility and short service life of the barrel, the weapon was employed throughout the German-Soviet War; an upgraded variant with wheeled carriage, Br-2M, remained in service at least until the 1970s. == Development and production ==  B-10  Work on a long range 152 mm gun for Reserve of the Main Command units started in 1929, when the Bolshevik Plant in Saint Petersburg received from the Artillery Directorate requirements specifications for such a piece.Shirokorad - Encyclopedia of Soviet Artillery. The project received a factory index B-10. First barrel was manufactured in April 1932; it was sent for trials even before the carriage, which had an unusual tracked construction, was ready. Development and testing of the B-10 continued until 1935; a number of problems were revealed, including slow elevation, low rate of fire and short service life. As a result, the gun was not adopted. The two produced barrels were experimentally modified for firing pre-rifled projectiles and polygonal projectiles respectively. The experiments didn't produce practical results. An attempt to improve elevation speed by use of an electric motor failed to provide smooth elevation. The Soviet Navy briefly considered adopting a derived weapon as a coastal gun, in towed or self-propelled variant, the latter based on T-28 medium tank chassis. Only the towed variant, B-25, reached factory trials; eventually it was canceled because of shortcomings of the design and decision of the Army not to adopt the B-10.  B-30 and Br-2  Br-2, rear view. In the early 1930s the Artillery Directorate ordered a development of a \\"heavy artillery triplex\\", consisting of a 152 mm gun, a 203 mm howitzer and a 280 mm mortar utilizing the same carriage. The Bolshevik Plant and the Barrikady Plant in Stalingrad were entrusted with the development. The 152 mm gun projects were called B-30 (sometimes referred to as B-10-2-30) and Br-2 respectively. Both mated a barrel ballistically identical to that of the B-10, to a tracked carriage of the 203 mm howitzer M1931 (B-4). Late in 1936, the Bolshevik Plant delivered an experimental series of six pieces. A number of longer (55 calibres) barrels and a number of barrels with deeper rifling were manufactured. The B-30 barrels were also used for ultimately unsuccessful experiments with pre-rifled shells and with \\"Ansaldo system\\" variable depth rifling. While generally similar to the competing design, the Br-2 had different barrel construction (built-up vs loose liner), slightly different breechblock and featured an equilibrating mechanism. Despite results of trials, which favored the B-30, the Artillery Directorate decided to adopt the Br-2. The reasons for the decision are not clear. However, it was decided to switch to free tube barrel construction in production pieces, making the gun somewhat more similar to the B-30. Improved variants Although the Br-2 was adopted, it was evident that the gun had significant drawbacks. One of the problems was very short life of the barrel: it took about 100 shots for the muzzle velocity to drop 4%. In an attempt to tackle the problem, an experimental piece with longer (55 calibers) barrel was produced; another experimental barrel had smaller chamber and deeper rifling. The latter solution was eventually preferred and from 1938 a variant with deep rifling replaced the original barrel in production. It was claimed that the new variant had five times longer service life. However, service life of the new barrel was measured using different criterion (10% drop in muzzle velocity), so actual improvement was probably much smaller. Another drawback of the gun was its low mobility, aggravated by separate transportation of the barrel. Attempts to improve the tracked carriage (such as the experimental T-117, which was tried out in 1939) were ultimately unsuccessful. In 1938 the Artillery Directorate issued specifications for a wheeled carriage for the Br-2 and the 203 mm howitzer M1931 (B-4). The project was handled by the design bureau of Plant no. 172 (located in Perm), headed by F. F. Petrov. Because the design bureau was busy with other tasks, the development of the new carriage - factory index M-50 - advanced slowly; it never advanced past the design phase and was canceled after the outbreak of the German-Soviet War. An improved wheeled cart Br-15 for barrel transportation was considered in 1940 but was never adopted, because it couldn't improve the mobility of the carriage. It took until 1955 to develop a variant of the Br-2 - designated Br-2M - which had wheeled carriage and didn't require separate transportation. The Br-2 was also used in a number of unsuccessful experiments with discarding sabot shells, intended to increase range. These included experiments carried out in 1940, with 162 mm barrel firing 162/100 mm shells. The barrel was damaged during the experiments; additionally, the gun was found to have unsatisfactory ballistics and problems with loading. Firing 152/107 mm shells failed to produce significant improvement in range. Br-19 The Br-19 was an experimental piece which combined elements of late production Br-2 (breechblock, barrel with deep rifling) with elements of B-30. The gun was tried out in 1939; it found superior to the Br-2 and was recommended for production, which, however, never started. Br-21 The Br-21 was an experimental 180 mm gun developed privately at the Barrikady Plant by mating Br-2 barrel bored out to the 180 mm caliber to carriage of B-4. The gun reached trials on 20 December 1939. The gun turned out to be more powerful and accurate than the Br-2, but was never adopted, because of the need to produce a new ammunition. Production The Br-2 was in production from 1936 or 1937 to 1940. At least 37 pieces were manufactured. Early pieces had barrels with the original \\"shallow\\" rifling (at least seven, built in 1936-37), while late production pieces had barrels with the newer \\"deep\\" rifling (27 in 1939-40). ==Description== Br-2, breech and controls. Br-2, track. The Br-2 had a long - 47.2 calibers - barrel of free- tube construction, with interrupted screw breech. The recoil system with variable recoil length consisted of hydraulic recoil buffer and hydro- pneumatic recuperator. The gun utilized bag loading ammunition. For assistance in loading, a special hoisting crane was used. The single trail tracked carriage was essentially the same as used for the 203 mm howitzer M1931 (B-4) and the 280 mm mortar M1939 (Br-5). It included an equilibrating mechanism of pushing type. The carriage allowed transportation of the weapon to short distances with the speed of 5‚Äì8 km/h. For longer distances, the barrel was removed from the carriage and transported separately on a special cart. In this case, it took from 45 minutes to two hours to prepare the weapon for combat. Several types of carts were used for barrel transportation. Guns produced in 1937 received the Br-6 cart. Other types used were the wheeled Br-10 (11.1 tons with the barrel) and the tracked Br-29 (13.42 tons with the barrel). In the trials report of 7 August 1938 both were referred to as unsatisfactory; the former because of bad passability and the latter because of excessive weight. For transportation of carriages, Voroshilovets tracked gun tractors were used. Less powerful Komintern tracked gun tractors were employed to pull gun carts. ==Organization and service== Br-2 in the Museum of Heroic Defense and Liberation of Sevastopol. As of June 1941, the Br-2 guns were issued to the heavy gun regiment of the Reserve of the Main Command. The regiment consisted of four battalions, each with three two-gun batteries, totaling 24 pieces. Two independent two-gun batteries also existed. After the outbreak of the German-Soviet War, the gun was employed by independent six-gun battalions. Later the organization was changed once again, to super heavy gun regiments of four two-gun batteries, totaling six Br-2 and two 210 mm gun M1939 (Br-17). By May 1945, the Red Army had four such regiments. The Br-2 (or possibly B-30) saw combat in the Winter War against Finland, one piece was lost.Shirokorad - Northern Wars of Russia. As of June 1941, the RKKA possessed 37 or 38soldat.ru. pieces, of them 24 in the aforementioned heavy artillery regiment and further four in two independent batteries. These batteries were given to the Arkhangelsk military district for use as coastal artillery.Ivanov - Artillery of the USSR in Second World War. The rest of the guns, mainly early production guns with shallow rifling and experimental pieces, remained in storage depots and proving grounds. There is only a fragmentary information of the actual combat use of the Br-2. Some sources mention the guns being used in the Battle of Kursk;Kolomiets, Svirin - Kursk Salient. the 8th Guards Army employed them in the Battle of the Seelow Heights.Isaev - Berlin 1945. A battle in the den of the beast. By the end of the war, Reserve of the Main Command still had 28 pieces, so apparently none were lost. The modernized Br-2M remained in service at least until the 1970s. Surviving pieces can be seen in the Central Armed Forces Museum (Moscow), in the Artillery Museum (Saint Petersburg) and on the Sapun Mountain (Sevastopol). ==Variants== *Br-2 with built-up barrel - experimental piece. *Br-2 with shallow rifling - at least seven pieces manufactured in 1936-37. *Br-2 with 162 mm barrel - experimental piece. *Br-2 with deep rifling - 27 pieces in 1939-40. *Br-2M - Br-2 barrel on a new wheeled carriage, adopted in 1955. ==Self-propelled mounts== The only self-propelled mount of the Br-2 was a variant of the experimental SU-14, based on the chassis of the T-35 heavy tank with elements of T-28 medium tank, and intended to carry either 203 mm howitzer or 152 mm gun. The prototype armed with Br-2 is referred to as SU-14Br-2. In Autumn 1941 the experimental piece shelled German forces from Kubinka proving ground. The vehicle is still on display in the Kubinka Tank Museum. ==Ammunition== The Br-2 fired specially developed ammunition. The shallow rifling pieces and the deep rifling ones also used different projectiles. High explosive / fragmentation and anti-concrete projectiles were produced; there is some indication that chemical and \\"special\\" (i.e. nuclear) projectiles also existed, though it is not completely clear. The bagged charge allowed three charges - full, no. 1 and no. 2. { border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2 style=\\"margin:0 0 .5em 1em; width:95%; background:#fff; border- collapse:collapse; border:1px solid #996; line-height:1.5; font-size:95%\\" - style=\\"vertical-align:top; text-align:center; border:1px solid #996; background-color:#996; color:#fff\\"  colspan=\\"6\\"  Ammunition for the pieces with deep rifling. - style=\\"vertical-align:top; text-align:center; border:1px solid #996;\\"  width=\\"15%\\" style=\\"border:1px solid #996\\"  Type  width=\\"15%\\" style=\\"border:1px solid #996\\"  Model  width=\\"15%\\" style=\\"border:1px solid #996\\"  Weight, kg  width=\\"15%\\" style=\\"border:1px solid #996\\"  HE weight, kg  width=\\"15%\\" style=\\"border:1px solid #996\\"  Muzzle velocity, m/s  width=\\"15%\\" style=\\"border:1px solid #996\\"  Range, m - style=\\"vertical- align:top; text-align:center;\\"  style=\\"border:1px solid #996; text- align:left\\"  HE-Frag  style=\\"border:1px solid #996\\"  OF-551  style=\\"border:1px solid #996\\"  48.9  style=\\"border:1px solid #996\\"  6.53  style=\\"border:1px solid #996\\"  880  style=\\"border:1px solid #996\\"  25,000 - style=\\"vertical-align:top; text-align:center;\\"  style=\\"border:1px solid #996; text-align:left\\"  Anti-concrete  style=\\"border:1px solid #996\\"  G-551  style=\\"border:1px solid #996\\"  49.0  style=\\"border:1px solid #996\\"   style=\\"border:1px solid #996\\"   style=\\"border:1px solid #996\\"  } { border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2 style=\\"margin:0 0 .5em 1em; width:95%; background:#fff; border-collapse:collapse; border:1px solid #996; line- height:1.5; font-size:95%\\" - style=\\"vertical-align:top; text-align:center; border:1px solid #996; background-color:#996; color:#fff\\"  colspan=\\"6\\"  Ammunition for the pieces with shallow rifling - style=\\"vertical-align:top; text-align:center; border:1px solid #996;\\"  width=\\"15%\\" style=\\"border:1px solid #996\\"  Type  width=\\"15%\\" style=\\"border:1px solid #996\\"  Model  width=\\"15%\\" style=\\"border:1px solid #996\\"  Weight, kg  width=\\"15%\\" style=\\"border:1px solid #996\\"  HE weight, kg  width=\\"15%\\" style=\\"border:1px solid #996\\"  Muzzle velocity, m/s  width=\\"15%\\" style=\\"border:1px solid #996\\"  Range, m - style=\\"vertical-align:top; text-align:center;\\"  style=\\"border:1px solid #996; text-align:left\\"  HE-Frag  style=\\"border:1px solid #996\\"  OF-550  style=\\"border:1px solid #996\\"  49.0  style=\\"border:1px solid #996\\"  7.0  style=\\"border:1px solid #996\\"  880  style=\\"border:1px solid #996\\"  27,000 - style=\\"vertical-align:top; text- align:center;\\"  style=\\"border:1px solid #996; text-align:left\\"  Anti- concrete  style=\\"border:1px solid #996\\"  –ì-550  style=\\"border:1px solid #996\\"  49.0  style=\\"border:1px solid #996\\"   style=\\"border:1px solid #996\\"   style=\\"border:1px solid #996\\"  } ==Notes References == *Isaev A.

It is found in Amazonian Brazil, Peru, and Colombia as well as in Guyana and French Guiana, and likely Suriname, and according to some sources, Venezuela. It is an aquatic caecilian that inhabits permanent rivers and marshes mainly in the lowland forest zone. ==Description== The Cayenne caecilian is an elongated, dark grey, black or steely blue amphibian with no limbs. The body is flattened laterally and has a number of transverse folds, giving it a segmented appearance. A long fin runs along its back, and it grows to a length of . It has a more highly derived morphology than some more primitive species, showing differences in lung structure, the reproductive organs, and the kidneys. ==Distribution== The Cayenne caecilian occurs in South America, including the Amazon basin and river systems in the Guianas. It is found at altitudes of up to above sea level. Because it is common and has a wide range, it is listed as of \\"Least Concern\\" in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. ==Biology== The Cayenne caecilian lives in shallow streams and rivers. It spends the day in a communal burrow, emerging at night to hunt through the sediment for small invertebrates such as insect larvae and shrimps. It also eats small fish. It has no functional eyes and probably detects its prey by touch or by the vibrations made when the prey moves. It has slime glands all over its body and secretes copious amounts of noxious mucous if attacked. Nevertheless, it is eaten by birds, snakes, and large fish. At breeding time, a male and female Cayenne caecilian twine around each other and the male places a spermatophore in the female's cloaca. Fertilisation is internal and the Cayenne caecilian is viviparous. Six to 14 young with gills develop inside the female's oviduct. At first, they feed on the yolks of their eggs, but they develop rasping teeth and later consume glandular secretions produced by the lining of the oviduct. Birth takes place after about eight months and the juvenile caecilians shed their temporary teeth and develop their adult dentition. The Cayenne caecilian is considered to have several characteristics that are more highly derived than other more primitive species. Its karyotype has been compared with that of other caecilians, and its diploid number has been found to be 28, a fact that does not support the hypothesis that, during the period of amphibian evolution, the number of chromosomes became reduced. However, many caecilians have not yet been karyotyped and the exact evolutionary relationships between the species have not yet been determined, so the hypothesis is not necessarily incorrect. ==References== compressicauda Category:Amphibians of Brazil Category:Amphibians of Colombia Category:Amphibians of French Guiana Category:Amphibians of Guyana Category:Amphibians of Peru Category:Amphibians described in 1841 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Typhlonectes compressicauda"},{"id":"12364492","text":"Typhlonectes is a genus of amphibians in the family Typhlonectidae.

New York: Dover, 791 The exact date of Shuttleworth's birth is uncertain. Shuttleworth was an excellent violinist and in the early 18th century he took part in the influential public concerts arranged by the London coal merchant Thomas Britton (known as 'the musical small coal man') at his business premises in Clerkenwell to which musical professionals and amateurs from all ranks of London society were drawn. Shuttleworth also led concerts that were later established about 1728 at the Swan Tavern, Cornhill. The 18th-century musical historian, Sir John Hawkins, wrote of him that he 'played the violin to such a degree of perfection, as gave him a rank among the first masters of his time'.Hawkins, John (1776 1963). A General History of the Science and Practice of Music. New York: Dover, 826 In January 1724, according to the newspaper the British Journal (11 January 1724), Shuttleworth was made organist at the church of St Michael, Cornhill, having previously been the organist at St Mary's, Whitechapel. On 4 May 1729 the London newspaper The London Evening Post announced his appointment as organist of the Temple Church.Newspaper references are taken from Computer Register of Musical Data in London Newspapers, 1660-1800, edited by Professor Rosamund McGuinness, and held at Royal Holloway, University of London According to Hawkins, Shuttleworth was 'celebrated for his fine finger on the organ, and drew numbers to hear him, especially at the Temple Church where he would frequently play near an hour after evening service'.

In 1758, he entered Daventry Academy at the behest of his teacher and minister, William Hextal. In 1763 he became the minister at Benn's Garden Chapel in Liverpool, a wealthy and well-connected congregation. In 1767 Enfield married Mary Holland, the daughter of a local draper, and together they had five children. In 1770 he moved to Warrington to be the minister of the Cairo Street Chapel and a tutor of rhetoric and modern languages at Warrington Academy. He remained there until 1785, when he was called to be the minister of the Octagon Chapel, Norwich. In Norwich Enfield's congregation assembled prominent families: the Martineaus, two unrelated Taylor families (those descending from John Taylor his predecessor at the Octagon, and that of William Taylor), and several others. His reputation was for bringing those of different views into polite discussion,, and he founded the Speculative Society, including Anglican and nonconformist clergy, and physicians. Enfield died on 3 November 1797.Webb, R. K. \\"William Enfield\\". Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Oxford University Press (2004). Retrieved on 21 July 2007. ==Works== Despite being a Unitarian, Enfield still respected the Established Church and supported the government intertwined with it. When fellow Unitarian Joseph Priestley attacked these institutions, Enfield published Remarks on Several Late Publications in a Letter to Dr. Priestley (1770). Enfield believed that Dissenters would eventually win recognition from the government and decried Priestley's abrasive strategy. Priestley replied in a dismissive pamphlet, but the two still remained friends. Eventually, after the failure of the Feathers Tavern Petition, Enfield changed his position, agreeing with Priestley that Dissenting civil rights were too slow in coming. Throughout his career, Enfield focused more on ethics than on theology in his many published sermons and essays. He was also a contributor to the Monthly Magazine and at his death had just started a biographical dictionary project with John Aikin, a friend from Warrington. Like Aikin and Priestley, Enfield wanted to remain current in many disciplines. Believing that natural philosophy was essential to his students, he studied mathematics one summer and subsequently published a textbook dedicated to Priestley: Institutes of Natural Philosophy, Theoretical and Experimental (1783). His most successful work, however, was The Speaker (1774), an anthology of literary extracts intended to teach elocution, and produced first for his Warrington pupils.Claudia L. Johnson, The Cambridge Companion to Mary Wollstonecraft (2002), p. 131. He published a sequel, Exercises in Elocution in 1780. Enfield's Speaker remained in print until the middle of the nineteenth century and inspired other anthologies, such as Mary Wollstonecraft's The Female Speaker. Enfield industriously translated Brucker‚Äôs multi-volume Critical History of Philosophy. ==NotesExternal links== *An Essay towards the History of Leverpool (1774), work by Enfield based on material from George Perry Category:1741 births Category:1797 deaths Category:People from Sudbury, Suffolk Category:English Unitarian ministers Category:Dissenting academy tutors ","title":"William Enfield"},{"id":"12364615","text":"Leicestershire was a county constituency in Leicestershire, represented in the House of Commons. It elected two Members of Parliament (MPs), traditionally called Knights of the Shire, by the bloc vote system of election, to the Parliament of England until 1707, to the Parliament of Great Britain from 1707 until 1800, and then to Parliament of the United Kingdom until 1832. ==History== The constituency was abolished by the Reform Act 1832 for the 1832 general election, when it was replaced by the Northern and Southern divisions, each of which elected two MPs. Both divisions were abolished by the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885 for the 1885 general election, when they were replaced by four new single-seat constituencies: Bosworth, Harborough, Loughborough and Melton. == Members of Parliament == 1290‚Äì1640 {  - !Parliament!!First member!!Second member -  1290 William HamelynRobert Burdet -  1295 Robert de WyvillJohn Aungerville -  1297 Sir Thomas de MeynillSir William Burdet of Loseby -  1300 John AungervilleJohn Folville -  1301 John AungervilleJohn Folville -  1302 Robert PonterelJohn Folville -  1305 John AungervilleRobert Ponterel -  1306 John AungervilleSir John Folville -  1307 (Jan) Sir William MarmionRichard de Perrers -  1307 (Oct) Sir John AungervilleSir William Marmion -  1309 Henry de ErdingtonRichard de Edgebaston -  1311 (Aug) Richard de PerrersJohn de Bakepuz -  1311 (Nov) Richard de PerrersJohn de Bakepuz -  1312 Ralph de SachevilleJohn Aungerville -  1313 Sir William BrabazonHenry de Nottingham -  1314 William TrussellJohn de Houby -  1315 Robert de WyvillRalph de Sacheville -  1316 (Jan) Ralph Folville  Richard de Edgebaston -  1316 (Jul) Ralph Folville  Richard de Edgebaston -  1318 Ralph FolvilleJohn de Olney -  1319 Henry de NottinghamRobert de Gaddesby -  1320 William de NevilleRalph Mallory -  1321 Ralph de Sacheville  William de Kaythorp -  1322 (May) Hugh de Prestwold Richard de Edgebaston -  1322 (Nov) Robert de Gaddesby William Jaunville -  1324 (Jan) Ralph de Sacheville Nicholas Payne -  1324 (Oct) Sir Robert BurdetRoger la Zouch -  1325 Ralph BelerRoger de Belgrave -  1327 (Jan) Sir Robert BurdetSir William Moton -  1327 (Sep) Roger de BelgraveRobert de Sadyngton -  1328 (Feb) Roger de GaddesbyRobert de Sadyngton -  1328 (Apr) Robert BurdetRobert de Sadyngton -  1328 (Jul) Ralph de SachevilleRobert de Waltham -  1329 Ralph de SachevilleJordan de Garthorp -  1330 (Mar) William MotonRobert Burdet -  1330 (Nov) Robert BurdetRichard de Edgebaston -  1331 Roger la ZouchWilliam de Staunton -  1332 (Mar) Richard de EdgebastonRalph de Sacheville -  1332 (Sep) Philip de FolvilleAlan Talbot -  1333 Alan TalbotJohn de Knighton -  1334 (Feb) John de KnightonSimon Pakeman -  1334 (Sep) Richard de EdgebastonHugh Turville -  1335 William MotonWilliam de Bredon -  1336 (Mar) William de BredonHugh Turville -  1337 (Mar) William MotonHugh Turville -  1337 (Sep) Roger la ZouchWilliam Moton -  1338 (Feb) Hugh TurvilleRoger de Belgrave -  1338 (Jul) William MotonNicholas Charnels -  1339 (Feb) William MotonJohn de Farrington -  1339 (Oct) William MotonRobert de Waltham -  1340 (Jan) Nicholas CharnelsRichard de Shelton -  1340 (Mar) John de BoyvilleThomas de Whelesbergh -  1340 (Jul) Richard de Edgebaston -  1341 John WaleysNicholas Charnels -  1343 William Moton -  1344 Thomas CharnelsJohn Hakelut -  1346 Simon PakemanRobert de Kegworth -  1348 (Jan) John WaleysSimon Pakeman -  1348 (Mar) Roger WaleysRobert de Gaddesby -  1351 John PaynelJohn de Levere -  1352 (Jan) William de BredonGeoffrey de Villiers -  1352 (Aug) Robert de Willoughby -  1353 Thomas Malesores -  1354 Thomas MalesoresJohn Paynel -  1355 Sir Nicholas CharnelsSir Thomas Malesores -  1357 Thomas MalesoresMathew de Folville -  1358 Sir John PaynelSir Thomas Malesores -  1360 Thomas de ChaworthJohn Charnels -  1361 Philip de NevillJohn Talbot -  1362 Sir William FlamvilleJohn Talbot -  1363 Robert de HerleRoger de Belers -  1365 Ralph de HastingsSimon Pakeman -  1366Sir William Flamville Simon Pakeman -  1368 John Talbot  Simon Pakeman -  1369 John Talbot  Thomas Oudeby -  1371 William FlamvilleWilliam Taillard -  1372 John Berkeley  William de Burgh -  1373 John Talbot  Robert Digby -  1376 Sir William FlamvilleRalph Bellers -  1377 (Jan)Sir William Flamville Ralph Bellers -  1377 (Nov) Sir William FlamvilleJohn Bellers -  1378 Edmund ApplebyThomas de Erdington -  1379 Thomas WalshSir Roger Perwych -  1380 (Jan) John BurdetJohn Fauconer -  1380 (Nov)Thomas WalshLaurence Hauberk -  1381Thomas Walsh Sir William Flamville -  1382 (May)Thomas Walsh Sir William Flamville -  1382 (Oct) John NevilleJohn Perwich -  1383 (Feb)Thomas WalshJohn Fauconer -  1384 (May) Sir William FlamvilleEdmund de Appleby -  1384 (Nov)Thomas WalshJohn Fauconer -  1385 John CalveleyJohn Fauconer -  1386 Sir William Flamville  Sir Thomas Walsh -  1388 (Feb) Sir William Flamville  Sir Thomas Walsh -  1388 (Sep) Sir William Flamville  Sir Roger Perwych (d.

After the business trip, Martin, who is divorced, will fly to London to visit his daughter. Martin is met by the film company's CFO, Lela Forin, who introduces him to the movie's leading man, washed-up action star Jake Mellows. Something is rotten with the production, though, and Martin senses it. Unfortunately, he sticks his nose in a little too deep for the corrupt bankrollers' tastes, and is soon deemed a threat. Martin is first offered a mega-bribe, but he rejects it. As it turns out, the bankrollers are Russian mafia, led by Oleg Butraskaya. Martin suddenly finds himself framed for an assassination attempt, and the hostile authorities‚Äîon the payroll of the mob‚Äîwant to kill him. American authorities are also hot on his trail, investigating him for money laundering, among other false charges. As Martin sifts through the mystery, he reveals the nefarious nature of Oleg's rackets, which include illegal pornography, kidnapping and money laundering. Not knowing whom to trust, he turns to Lela, but soon, she, too, is marked for death. Jake, who has gambling debts, is persuaded by Oleg to speak lines for the film that are actually used to make Martin believe the actor is holding Martin's daughter captive. After a fight between them, Martin and Jake join forces with Lela to stage an illusion during which Oleg incriminates himself to the law. Lela develops a new film project for Jake and a personal interest in Martin. == Cast == * Michael Keaton as Martin Raikes * Michael Caine as Jake Mellows * Judith Godreche as Lela Forin * Rade Sherbedgia as Oleg Butraskaya * Matthew Marsh as Michel Cote * Xander Berkeley as Joey Patterson * Kathleen Wilhoite as Beth Ann * Rachel Ferjani as Rachel * Elina L√∂wensohn as Vannessa * Clare Thomas as Emma * Hermione Norris as Sarah * William Beck as Nicoli * Jean-Yves Berteloot as Vincent Deschamps * Jean-Pierre Castaldi as Jean Pillon * Colin Stinton as Harbinson * Bogdan E.

The role was originally offered to Danniella Westbrook https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0922449/bio ==Storylines== Series 6 Natalie arrives at Larkhall with tough talking prostitute Frances Allen. Natalie herself is a meek school teacher who has been arrested for fraud. As she arrives on G-Wing, word gets around that Natalie is a nonce (prison slang for child molester), so the other prisoners begin picking on her, but Frances protects her. When she asks Frances to make a phone call for her, this results in a truck being pulled over and a number of refugee children are discovered inside, set to be sold as sex slaves. When Natalie is informed about this, she reveals that she has sexually abused children before in front of Allen, who is actually Detective Inspector Frances Myers (Eva Pope), who was working undercover to entrap Natalie.

The women stand their ground and begin chanting \\"Nonce, nonce, nonce...\\" at Natalie and promise to give her a hard time. When Natalie confesses to being a pedophile, Frances slaps her, just as Colin Hedges (Tristan Surrock) walks into her office. Following a fight with Al McKenzie (Pauline Campbell), in which Natalie stamps on Al with her high heels after Al brandished a straight razor, Natalie manipulates her into thinking that her boyfriend had actually abused the children. She sets up a plan with Bev Tull (Amanda Barrie) and Phyl Oswyn (Stephanie Beacham) to trap Julie Saunders' (Victoria Alcock) hand in a sewing machine, and make it look like an accident. Natalie saves Julie's hand, badly cutting her own in the process. This, however, wins over the other inmates. After Phyl and Bev make rhubarb hootch, which results in Al dying, Natalie blackmails them and forces them to poison Frances with it; the attempt fails, however. Natalie then does acts of sodomy with fellow prisoner Kris Yates (Jennifer Ness), who is also in a secret same-sex relationship with officer Selena Geeson (Charlotte Lucas). Natalie does her best to split them up, and reports their relationship when Kris rejects her advances and attacks her. Kris is branded a bully and Natalie is released from Cellular Confinement. Phyl and Bev plan to cut all ties with Natalie and set her up to be attacked by Darlene Cake (Antonia Okonma). Natalie, however, gets the better of her and wins the fight. Natalie then turns the tables on them and ropes them into scaring Darlene by making her think she is cursed. When Kris escapes, Natalie continues to expose the relationship between Selena and Kris, so Frances has Natalie put on the transfer list. Series 7 When the seventh series begins, Natalie is still at Larkhall and Frances has been transferred to another prison and promoted to Governing Governor. Now, free of Frances, Natalie enlists herself as Top Dog and begins a reign of terror with Darlene roped in for help. She begins a tax racket and all of the women fall victims. New inmates, Janine Nebeski (Nicola Stapleton) and Arun Parmar (Rebecca Hazlewood) become Natalie's newest victims when she stabs Janine in the eye with a needle and steals from Arun. Janine figures that she would be safer to become an ally of Natalie. The two then attack Arun in the library, though Janine is forced into doing so. When Jim Fenner (Jack Ellis) is released from prison and is reinstated as the Governor of G-Wing, Natalie begins an affair with him and is determined to let his wife Di Barker (Tracey Wilkinson) know about it. Di slaps Natalie in front of the other prisoners when she finds out, which is what Natalie wants. Di is then forced to apologise to Natalie in front of everyone. Natalie then plans an escape on her \\"weekend out\\" with Janine. Fenner also promises her compassionate leave for the weekend. Her first attempt is thwarted before she can leave the prison, when Pat Kerrigan (Liz May Brice) arrives and holds Sister Thomas Moore hostage. Natalie and Fenner's relationship soon becomes hostile and it is not long before she ends up becoming one of his many enemies. Natalie, Janine and Darlene begin to torment Arun when they discover she is a male-to-female transsexual. Before Arun is transferred to a men's prison or commits suicide, Natalie's new found arch enemy, Pat, defends her. The two fight and Natalie is dethroned as Top Dog. This fight resulted in Brent sustaining a broken nose. When Fenner is murdered by Julie Johnston (Kika Mirylees), Natalie becomes a suspect, but Di is wrongly charged with the murder. Natalie then continues to plan her escape and is almost successful in her bid to break free. But Pat organises a mob to wait for Natalie outside the hotel and stop her. Natalie is slapped by one of the angry women, so she headbutts them right back. Natalie begins having sex with prison officer Kevin Spiers (Andrew Scarborough) but he turns violent when her true colours show. When Natalie's visit with Iga Lukasiak, one of the children that she sold as a sex slave is recorded and played to the whole of G-Wing, the entire prison turn against Natalie, including Darlene and Janine. Natalie's hopes of an appeal for her case are dashed. Natalie resumes her affair with Kevin, but Chaplain. Christy Mackay (Gaynor Howe) discovers their relationship and threatens to report it. Natalie then manipulates mentally ill prisoner Miranda Miles (Nicola Redmond) into murdering Christy. Series 8 Natalie has found a new ally, in the form of new inmate, Ashley Wilcox (Sandra De Sousa), and the two torment new Muslim inmate, Emira Al Jahani (Laura Dos Santos), into making crystal meth. Ashley is later found dead of Legionnaires' disease. Natalie then incites the women to attack new officer Donny Kimber (Sid Owen), and evacuate the prison. Natalie forces Janine to smuggle drugs back to the prison when she returns from her mother's funeral. Janine is found out, however, and Pat gets revenge on her on Janine's behalf by forcing her to swallow a mouthful of drugs. Natalie and Pat's feud gets heated and the two begin to plot against each other. Natalie incites a mentally disturbed new inmate, Angela Robbins, into attacking Pat. Natalie then has drugs smuggled into prison by getting someone to visit her with a young child and hide the drugs in the child's vagina. Pat finds this out and is determined to make Natalie pay. Pat manipulates Natalie into thinking she has an escape plan with the help of The Julies and Tina. Natalie then beats up Julie S and falls into the trap when Julie S exposes Pat's \\"escape plan\\". However, Pat has made a change to the plan and plans to stab Natalie with a gardening fork. On the day of Julie's son's wedding blessing, Natalie goes ahead with the escape. Pat and Natalie fight against time to get to the bin's first. Natalie gets there first. Natalie plans to hide in a bin bag, and leave in the bin truck. Pat, however, also has other plans. Pat arrives at the bin's and begins to attack a bin bag with the gardening fork but Natalie is hiding behind her and a fight erupts between the two. The fight ends when one of them is bludgeoned to death with a brick, this is later revealed to be Natalie. Everyone believes that Natalie has escaped and that Pat's plan was unsuccessful. The Julies discover that this is not true and find Natalie's body. The three then plot how to dispose of Natalie's corpse, her body is then dropped down a drain, into the sewers, and forgotten about. Ghost In the final episode of Bad Girls, Natalie's decaying corpse is clogging up the prisons drains. With Pat down the block, the Julies have to resolve the problem. Julie S later goes down to the sewers to move the body. Sylvia Hollamby (Helen Fraser), has a dream reminiscent of A Christmas Carol, in which the ghost of Natalie Buxton appears and tells Sylvia that she is dead and that her body is what is causing the problems at Larkhall. She also tells Sylvia that she is now the most hated woman in the prison, even more so than Natalie was. Natalie shows her how happy everyone, including her son, would be after hearing she was dead, and then takes Sylvia down to the sewers and shows her the potential result of her ways. Sylvia wakes up from the dream and returns to work. She then confides in Pat that she thinks Natalie is dead. Pat shrugs it off and continues to celebrate Christmas. == References External links== * Natalie Buxton character profile Category:Bad Girls (TV series) Category:Fictional drug dealers Category:Fictional prison escapees Category:Fictional torturers Category:Female characters in television Category:Fictional schoolteachers Category:Television characters introduced in 2004 Category:Fictional bisexual females Category:Fictional pedophiles Category:Fictional rapists Category:Female villains Category:Fictional prisoners and detainees Category:Fictional LGBT characters in television Category:Fictional ghosts Category:LGBT villains Category:Psychopathy in fiction ","title":"Natalie Buxton"},{"id":"12364657","text":"Sunyeophaa (1769‚Äì1780), also called Lakshmi Singha (), was an Ahom king.

Now it is a museum dedicated to the memory of Mozart and to the former owners and Mozart‚Äôs hosts: Franti≈°ek and Josefina Du≈°ek. == Background == It is little known that Mozart's purported visits to the Bertramka are actually very scantily documented. No contemporary observer ever reported seeing him there, and Mozart himself never claimed to have stayed there in any of his surviving correspondence from Prague. There is furthermore no documentary basis to support widespread assertions that Mozart completed the operas Don Giovanni and La clemenza di Tito at the Bertramka, or indeed ever even worked on them there. Claims of frequent visits are not recorded before the nineteenth century. For his first visit to Prague (in January and February 1787), Mozart is only recorded to have stayed in the palace of Count Johann Joseph Franz von Thun-Hohenstein in Mal√° Strana. For the other two extended visits (October to November 1787 and August to September 1791), it is difficult to see how continuous residence at the Bertramka would have been practical for Mozart, since it was located far outside the city walls of Prague at the time, and it would have been necessary to \\"commute\\" daily into the city by some sort of conveyance in order to participate in the musical commitments that were expected of him. Only occasional visits are likely. The best evidence that he ever stayed there at all (and only during his second visit to Prague in October and November 1787) comes from his son Karl Thomas Mozart in a reminiscence of 1856. Karl Thomas was not present for the incident reported, rather only heard about it from friends of Mozart he met in Prague as a boy in the 1790s.See Freeman 2013, Mozart in Prague, 138-39. == See also == * List of music museums ==References== *Official brochure of Comenius, Society for Culture and Education *Freeman, Daniel E.

Noted for his agile, gymnastic style in the ring, he has toured successfully across Europe and Japan and held British, European and World (European version) titles in five different weight divisions. == Career == Collins made his professional debut in 1983 against Adrian Finch before going on to be a regular star of ITV's World of Sport programme. Despite losing his TV debut to veteran heel \\"Crybaby\\" Jim Breaks, Collins would come back in 1984 to defeat Breaks first in an elimination tournament final, then in a ¬£500-per- fall challenge, before finally capturing Breaks' British Welterweight Title. The following year, Collins would capture the European Welterweight Championship from visiting champion Jorg Chenok (billed as Baron Von Chenok) in a match screened on ITV during World Of Sport's special 1985 FA Cup Final edition. As a result of this victory, Danny would tour France and northern Spain extensively during the late 1980s for local promoter Roger Delaporte. Collins was also a frequent tag team partner of Big Daddy as well as teaming with his younger brother Pete Collins. He continued to have a successful wrestling career in the United Kingdom and across Europe despite an operation to have his kidney removed in the mid-1980s, using a high-flying style in his matches that was unusual for British wrestling at the time. He further developed the cartwheel escape from an arm lever first invented by Dynamite Kid in the mid-1970s - itself an advance on the traditional roll on the mat to untwist an arm lever. After ITV's coverage of wrestling ended in 1988, he achieved even greater success, moving to All Star Wrestling, where he defeated Dave \\"Fit\\" Finlay to win the British Heavy-Middleweight Championship in 1989. Although he controversially lost the title by disqualification to Richie Brooks in Croydon in 1990, he would soon regain the belt that same year. In 1991, he defeated Owen Hart for the vacant World Middleweight Championship and would continue to claim the title until 1995 when he moved still further up the weights. In April to May 1991, Collins toured the UK with the World Wrestling Federation.http://www.cagematch.net/?id=2&nr;=1831&page;=4&year;=1991&promotion;=1 A year later he returned to work for the WWF in a dark match at London Arena for the UK Rampage card, Collins lost to Alan Kilby.http://www.profightdb.com/wrestlers/danny-boy-collins-11369.html Around late 1994/early 1995, Collins became a heel after a (kayfabe) falling out with Robbie Brookside and Doc Dean. Rebranded 'Dirty' Dan Collins, in 1996, he defeated Alan Kilby to become British Light-Heavyweight Champion, but lost the title back to Kilby in 1997. He also teamed with fellow heel Drew McDonald, particularly for Otto Wanz's CWA in Germany and Austria. By the end of the 1990s, he had reverted to being a blue eye but his brother Peter was still a devout heel, known by then as 'Mr Vain' Pete Collins. This led to a lengthy feud between the two. In 1996, Collins won the British Commonwealth Junior Heavyweight Championship while working in Japan for Michinoku Pro. He made two tours with the Japanese promotion and worked with the likes of Great Sasuke, Dick Togo, Gran Hamada, Tiger Mask and Funaki. Collins' career slowed down to near-inactivity around 2000 due to accumulated back injuries, but he still appears sporadically on the British wrestling scene. In 2007, he launched a major comeback tour with All Star Wrestling, frequently working as a tag team with Dean Allmark. In October 2008 he lost to Germany's Christian \\"Ecki\\" Eckstein at GL1 Gloucester Leisure Centre. Collins took part in Wrestling Rampage 2012 at GL1 Gloucester Leisure Centre on 4 February. He teamed up with Matt Jarrett to face Skull Murphy (Peter Northey) and 'Blondie' Bob Barrett. As of 2012, Collins became a regular trainer at the WAW Academy in Norwich and a regular member of the roster for WAW as a heel allied with The Midas Stable. In March 2012 he won the WAW World Heavyweight Championship. On 24 March 2013 Danny 'Boy' Collins made his first appearance for Best of British Wrestling at their Ipswich Invasion show where he defeated ex ECW & Current Ring of Honor star Steve Corino 2 Falls to 1. Collins wrestled what was billed as his last match on British soil on 10 October 2013 at GL1 Gloucester Leisure Centre for Superstars Of Wrestling. He made his retirement match in Germany for European Wrestling Promotion as he wrestled in the main event against Lance Storm. Two months later, Collins returned to in ring competition. Throughout 2014, Collins owned and operated his own wrestling school in Sutterton, Lincolnshire. Throughout 2015, Collins worked regularly across England for HEW, WAW and All Star. In 1 September 2017 Collins worked for the American promotion Chikara in their King of Trios event which took place in Wolverhampton. In February 2018 Collins faced American star Chris Silvio at Cheltenham Town Hall for World Pro Wrestling. ==Championships and accomplishments== *Joint Promotions **British Welterweight Championship (3 times) **European Welterweight Championship (1 time) *All Star Wrestling **World Middleweight Championship (1 time) **British Light-Heavyweight Championship (1 time) **British Heavy-Middleweight Championship (2 times) *World Association of Wrestling **WAW World Heavyweight Championship (1 time) *European Wrestling Promotion **EWP Intercontinental Championship (1 time) *Michinoku Pro Wrestling **Michinoku Pro British Commonwealth Junior Heavyweight Championship (1 time) *Falling Starr Wrestling **FSW Heavyweight Championship (1 time, current) ==ReferencesExternal links== *Online World of Wrestling profile Category:1967 births Category:English male professional wrestlers Category:Living people Category:People from Bristol ","title":"Danny Boy Collins"},{"id":"12364798","text":"Arthur \\"Montana\\" Taylor (1903 ‚Äì c.1958) Stefan Wirz, Montana Taylor Discography, Wirz.de.

The family moved to Chicago and then, around 1910, to Indianapolis, where Taylor learned piano. Later he moved to Cleveland, Ohio. By 1929 he was back in Chicago, where he recorded a few tracks for Vocalion Records, including \\"Indiana Avenue Stomp\\" and \\"Detroit Rocks\\". He then disappeared from the public record for some years, during which he may have given up playing piano. However, in 1946 he was rediscovered by jazz fan Rudi Blesh, and was recorded both solo and as the accompanist to Bertha \\"Chippie\\" Hill. The later recordings proved he had lost none of his instrumental abilities, and had developed as a singer.

His father, Ludvig Kalckar, was a businessman with an avid interest in theatre, especially the work of Henrik Ibsen. His mother, Bertha (n√©e Melchior) Rosalie introduced Kalckar to a variety of French and German writers, including Gustave Flaubert, Marcel Proust, Johann von Goethe, and Heinrich Heine. Kalckar observed that this time allowed his ‚Äúinterest in the humanistic disciplines‚Äù to develop and thrive.Kalckar, 1991, p. 2 In his autobiographical reflections, Kalckar spent little time on his early education and referred to high school biology experience as \\"somewhat static,\\" except for \\"some extraordinary demonstrations in human physiology\\" by August Krogh. Krogh, a physiologist and Professor at the University of Copenhagen, won the 1920 Nobel prize for his description of capillary blood flow and regulation, introduced the principles of human physiology to Danish high school students. Krogh's demonstrations introduced the students to a number of modern physiology instruments and experimental techniques.Kalckar, 1991, p. 2-3 The experience seems to have profoundly influenced Kalckar's choicer of research area. ==Graduate Work== Kalckar completed his medical training at the University of Copenhagen in 1933, and then began research for his Ph.D. in Ejnar Lundsgaard's (1899‚Äì1968) physiology laboratory; that work established the foundation of a fundamental biochemical paradigm, i.e. \\"oxidative phosphorylation\\". During this period, Lundsgaard was preoccupied as physiology department chair, consequently Fritz Albert Lipmann, who had recently fled Germany,Singleton, R. Jr. 2007a. \\"Ochoa, Severo.\\" In \\"New Dictionary of Scientific Biography, vol. 5,\\" edited by Noretta Koertge, Detroit: Charles Scribner's & Sons, pp. 305-312. served as Kalckar's research mentor. Later, Kalckar and Lipmann both independently developed concepts of a \\"high energy bond\\" (which Lipmann famously expressed as \\"~P\\") and ATP as a universal \\"energy carrier.\\"Singleton, R. Jr. 2007b. \\"Kalckar, Herman Moritz.\\" In \\"New Dictionary of Scientific Biography, vol. 4\\" edited by Noretta Koertge, Detroit: Charles Scribner's & Sons, pp. 71-76 Kalckar was fortunate to be working at an important period in biochemistry's evolution.Singleton, R. Jr. 2007b The biochemical community was in the process of demonstrating the chemical reactions involved in breakdown of foodstuffs essential for growth. At the same time, physiologists were demonstrating the involvement of some of these reactions various physiological processes, e.g. muscle contraction. Kalckar's breakthrough work was the demonstration that organic compounds, which were phosphorylated during metabolic processes, involved oxygen consumption; oxygen consumption was linked to organic compound phosphorylation. His key experiment demonstrated that in frog muscles where glycolysis had been inhibited with iodoacetate, muscular contraction continued for a short period using phosphocreatine as a source of energy.Kalckar, H. M. Biological phosphorylations: development of concepts. Prentice-hall, Englewood Cliffs N.J, 1969, pp. 171‚Äì172 Kalckar referred to this process as ‚Äúaerobic phosphorylation‚Äù (now called oxidative phosphorylation, a biochemical process fundamental to all living organisms). The work was the first demonstration that carbohydrate oxidation and carbohydrate phosphorylation were linked, i.e. the two pathways were directly ‚Äúcoupled.‚Äù Singleton, R. Jr. 2007b Furthermore, the study helped establish the basic phenomenon of oxidative phosphorylation, opened the way for its systematic exploration, and suggested for the first time that phosphate compounds acted as a link between catabolism and anabolism.Kennedy, E., 1996 ==First American Work== \\"With best wishes to our friend Herman Kalckar\\", Carl and Gerty Cori Upon completing his graduate studies, Kalckar received a Rockefeller research fellowship to spend a year at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). After arriving in the United States in early 1939, Kalckar briefly visited the Cori lab in St. Louis en route to the west coast. The Coris had unsuccessfully attempted to reproduce Kalckar's oxidative phosphorylation work, and Kalckar was able to point out a key element missing in their experiment. During his St. Louis visit Kalckar and Sidney Colowick (1916‚Äì1985) became good friends.Singleton, 2007b Kalckar and his wife arrived in Pasadena in the Spring of 1939 and rapidly became a part of the Caltech social and intellectual community, including Max Delbr√ºck, Linus Pauling, and James and David Bonner. At Delbr√ºck's suggestion he attended C. B. van Niel‚Äôs popular Pacific Grove microbiology course, an event that had a lifetime influence on his research career.Kennedy, E., 1996 While at Caltech, Kalckar wrote and published what was, arguably, one of his most important papers. Under Pauling's influence he reviewed the literature dealing with biological energetic mechanisms. In 108 pages, including 310 references, the paper was a virtual synopsis of the state of biochemistry at the time. As Kalckar noted: > The aim of this review has been not only to collect and coordinate knowledge > from very different fields, like animal physiology, microbiology, enzyme > chemistry, organic and physical chemistry, but also to interpret all the > fundamental biological phenomena from a dynamic point of view. (p. 167) Although not highly cited, the paper was important because Kalckar provided strong evidence for the role of \\"high energy\\" compounds in metabolic processes. In the paper Kalckar developed an argument for the central role of Adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) as a common metabolic \\"energy carrier.\\" The paper is not highly cited, most likely, because Kalckar's mentor and friend, Fritz Lipmann, published a similar review in which he introduced the notion of \\"~P\\" as a means of representing a \\"high energy\\" bond.Singleton, 2007b The onset of World War II stranded the Kalckars in the United States; Kalckar was offered an appointment as a research fellow at Washington University, and he and his wife moved to St. Louis. Kalckar resumed his friendship with Colowick, and they collaborated to work on the enzyme adenylate kinase in 1942, which they purified from muscle extracts. Further work on nucleotide metabolism allowed him to identify nucleoside phosphorylase, a key enzyme in nucleotide salvage pathways. The work was very important in expanding Kalckar's research interests because previously he had worked with complex physiological systems. In his Washington University work, he focused on individual enzymes and their purification.Singleton 2007b At an invitation from Oliver Lowry (1910‚Äì1996), Kalckar moved to the New York Public Health Institute as a research associate. The move was an important part of developing Kalckar's research biochemical abilities as an enzymologist, because as Paul Berg commented, he ‚Äúdeveloped a whole new approach to being able to use enzymes in a novel way.‚Äù The lab was equipped with a Beckman DU ultraviolet spectrophotometer, introduced in 1941 and still relatively rare; Kalckar rapidly used the instrument to develop several novel enzyme assays. In 1947 he published three papers on purine metabolism enzymes, all of which were highly cited (3,200 citations in 2006).Singleton 2007b Famous Post-Graduate Student: James D.

Retrieved May 11, 2011. northwest of the county seat, Mayfield. As of the 2010 census it had a population of 458. Fancy Farm is on Kentucky Route 80 in the rural, far-western portion of the state called the Jackson Purchase. It was settled by Roman Catholics starting in 1829, and is known for being a strongly Catholic area. The community grew around St. Jerome Church, built in 1836. The first post office opened in 1843. The colorful name was apparently chosen when the post office opened, by a man who was applying to be postmaster. It was first mentioned in the U.S. Census in 1870 as a post office in Boswell Precinct; first mentioned as a town in Magisterial District 5 in the 1910 census; and finally enumerated as a town in its own precinct in the 1920 census. stump speech at the Fancy Farm picnic. ==St. Jerome Church Picnic== The village is the site of the annual St. Jerome Catholic Church Picnic, famous as a traditional political gathering attracting statewide and occasionally national candidates. The picnic, referred to by non-locals as the \\"Fancy Farm Picnic,\\" began in 1881 as a purely local affair. It takes place on the grounds of the church, which have expanded thanks in part to the picnic's success. Since 1956, the year that Kentucky moved its primary election to May from August, it has been held on the first Saturday in August and has come to represent the traditional starting point of the fall campaign season in Kentucky. The picnic was of largely local interest until two-time Governor A. B. \\"Happy\\" Chandler (best known for being the second Commissioner of Major League Baseball) began making appearances, going for the first time in 1931 while running successfully for lieutenant governor. So many Kentucky politicians attend that it is news when a major state politician decides not to make an appearance, such as U.S. Sen. Jim Bunning in 2007. National figures who have made speeches include George C. Wallace in 1975, Lloyd Bentsen in 1988 and Al Gore in 1992. Vice President Alben Barkley, who was born at nearby Wheel and lived in Paducah, spoke many times over the years. In addition to the political appearances, the picnic offers traditional fair activities such as bingo games and raffle prizes. Food includes barbecue, a Knights of Columbus fish fry on Friday evening, and homemade baked goods. The event was recognized in the 1985 Guinness Book of World Records as the \\"World's Largest Picnic\\" for the consumption of 15,000 pounds of mutton, pork, and chicken at the 1982 picnic. The picnic proceeds are used to finance the Catholic elementary school and local improvements. No outside vendors participate, but people representing political causes sell paraphernalia, and about 12,000 to 15,000 people attend each year. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Community website Category:Census-designated places in Graves County, Kentucky Category:Census-designated places in Kentucky Category:Politics of Kentucky ","title":"Fancy Farm, Kentucky"},{"id":"12364911","text":"1975 in philosophy ==Events== * ==Publications== * Anderson, Alan Ross and Nuel Belnap.

He was a switch hitter, threw with his right hand, was 5 feet 10 inches tall, and weighed 165 pounds. ==Baseball career== Hunnefield was a member of the Massachusetts state champion baseball team from Framingham High School in 1916 (as reported in the Middlesex News on February 14, 1993), and graduated from Framingham High in 1918. Hunnefield attended Northeastern University, where he played on the baseball team. He was an infielder who played for the Chicago White Sox and Cleveland Indians of the American League and the Boston Braves and New York Giants of the National League in a six-season career from 1926 to 1931. Playing in a total of 511 games, his batting average was .272 and his fielding percentage was .944. He finished second in the league in stolen bases in 1926. He played on the winning side in two no-hitters: Ted Lyons (1926) and Wes Ferrell (1931). There is a vintage \\"exhibit\\" card issued in 1927 that pictures Chicago White Sox pitcher Tommy Thomas, and was mislabeled as \\"Wm. Hunnefield\\". Bill Hunnefield does appear in a 1993 baseball card set created from photo archives of the Sporting News on card #696. After his major league career, he was a player and manager in the summer Cape Cod League back when it was an \\"open\\" league. He also was a manager in the semi-pro Boston Parks League in the early 1940s. In the off-season, Hunnefield was an accountant and often reported late to spring training because it coincided with tax season. In the late 1940s he moved to New York City with his wife, Jean Nathan, where they founded the Jean Nate company. They operated this company successfully until its sale in 1963 to Lanvin. ==External links== *Sports Illustrated Bill Hunnefield *Bill Hunnefield MLB Baseball Player *Baseball library *Bill Hunnefield baseball card Category:1899 births Category:1976 deaths Category:Boston Braves players Category:Chicago White Sox players Category:Cleveland Indians players Category:New York Giants (NL) players Category:Major League Baseball infielders Category:Major League Baseball second basemen Category:Major League Baseball shortstops Category:Baseball players from Massachusetts Category:Framingham High School alumni Category:Sportspeople from Dedham, Massachusetts ","title":"Bill Hunnefield"},{"id":"12364975","text":"The 2007 Speedway Ekstraliga season is the 8th since its establishment.

The latter was fitted out as an offshore radio ship and broadcast as Radio Nordsee International between 1970 and 1974, off the coast of Scheveningen and, for a few months, Essex. The smaller Mebo I was used as a supply tender, and was renamed Angela (after Mrs Meister). When the Netherlands outlawed the supply of offshore radio broadcasters, and after a legal battle with the Dutch government over the impounding of the Mebo II, Mebo leased (later, sold) the Angela and Mebo II to Libya in 1977. Mebo II was renamed El Fatah and broadcast Libyan radio programmes from Tripoli harbour. In 1984, both El Fatah and Almasira (ex Angela) were used as target practice by the Libyan navy and airforce, and were sunk in the Gulf of Sidra. ==Lockerbie trial== Because a Mebo Telecommunications timing device was alleged to have been used to trigger the bomb that destroyed Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie on 21 December 1988 killing 270 people, Erwin Meister and Edwin Bollier were summoned to give evidence in the second month of the Lockerbie trial. Timers for Libya In week 7 of the trial, Meister testified that Mebo had supplied Libya with 20 MST-13 timing devices, and identified one of the two accused (Abdelbaset al- Megrahi) as a former business contact. The defence asked Meister, under cross- examination, to explain the purpose of his visit to Syria in 1984. Meister's partner, Edwin Bollier, was questioned in week 8. Bollier said Mebo made a range of products including briefcases equipped to radio-detonate IEDs. He agreed that Mebo had sold 20 MST-13 timers to Libya in 1985, which were later tested by Libyan special forces at their base at Sabha. Bollier said: \\"I was present when two such timers were included in bomb cylinders\\". In court, Bollier was shown a number of printed circuit board fragments which he identified as coming from the Mebo MST-13 timer, but he claimed that these timer fragments appeared to have been modified. Timers for East Germany Joachim Wenzel, an employee of the Stasi, the former East German intelligence agency, testified behind screens in week 9. Wenzel claimed to have been Bollier's handler in the years 1982‚Äì85 and testified that Mebo had supplied the Stasi with timers. Criminal complaint During week 11 of the trial, Mebo lawyer Dieter Neupert filed an official criminal complaint against the Crown over what he alleged was a 'forged fragment of MST-13 timer'. False testimony Former Mebo employee, Ulrich Lumpert, told the Scottish Court in the Netherlands that as an electronics engineer he had produced all of the firm's MST-13 timers. Lumpert agreed that the fragments shown to him in court \\"could be\\" from that timer and was asked to confirm his signature on a letter concerning a technical fault with the prototype MST-13 timer. Seven years later, on 18 July 2007, Lumpert claimed he had lied at the trial. In an affidavit before a Zurich notary, Lumpert stated that he had stolen a prototype MST-13 timer PC-board from Mebo and that he had given it on 22 June 1989, to \\"an official person investigating the Lockerbie case\\". Dr Hans K√∂chler, UN observer at the Lockerbie trial, was sent a copy of Lumpert's affidavit and issued a report on the matter. Dr K√∂chler told the Glasgow Herald: :\\"The Scottish authorities are now obliged to investigate this situation. Not only has Mr Lumpert admitted to stealing a sample of the timer, but to the fact he gave it to an official and then lied in court\\". Conviction Only one of the two accused Libyans, Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, was convicted of the Lockerbie bombing on 31 January 2001. Six years later, on 28 June 2007, the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission granted Megrahi leave for a second appeal against the conviction. Megrahi's appeal at the Court of Criminal Appeal in Edinburgh was dropped and he was released on 20 August 2009, on compassionate grounds, suffering from terminal cancer. ==See also== *Hans K√∂chler's Lockerbie trial observer mission *Pierre P√©an ==ReferencesExternal links== *Hans K√∂chler's Lockerbie trial observer mission website Category:Telecommunications companies of Switzerland Category:Pan Am Flight 103 ","title":"Mebo Telecommunications"},{"id":"12365060","text":"Nymphargus grandisonae (common names: giant glass frog, red-spotted glassfrog) is a species of frog in the family Centrolenidae. It is found in Andes of Colombia and Ecuador. Its natural habitat is tropical moist montane forest (cloud forest); larvae develop in streams and still-water pools. Its habitat is threatened by habitat loss, introduced fish, and agricultural pollution, but it is still a common species not considered threatened by the IUCN. ==Description== Adult males of this species are about long and adult females are about . The large, bulbous eyes have yellow irises. The body and limbs are slender, and there are large adhesive discs on the tips of the fingers and toes. The male has a hooked spur on the upper arm which is used when fighting rivals. The upper parts of head and body are green with many small red circular spots. The underparts are whitish or creamy yellow. ==Distribution and habitat== This frog is endemic to Colombia and Ecuador, being found on the western slopes of the Western Cordilleras and the Central Cordilleras in Colombia, and in the Ecuadorean provinces of Carchi, Cotopaxi, Pichincha and Santo Domingo de los Ts√°chilas. Its altitudinal range is between . It is to be found in foliage in swamps and near streams, in cloud forest, by forest edges, in pastures and by roadsides, but never far from forests. ==Ecology== This species is nocturnal and breeds in streams and pools. Males congregate in vegetation a few metres above a water body and call to attract the females. They continue to call for a few days, or up to three months, from their favoured locations (average 36 days). They engage in fights with rival males, dangling from twigs and leaves with their hind limbs while using the spurs on their forelimbs to engage. They are sometimes injured during these battles. A pair of frogs was observed in amplexus on the upper surface of a large leaf for several hours, and watched using red light, so as not to disturb them. They moved around the leaf, moved to a few more leaves and then returned to their starting leaf. Here the female positioned herself with the tip of her abdomen near the edge of the leaf and started laying eggs, edging her way forward while doing so. The male made various leg movements which may have facilitated spreading his sperm over the eggs. When the clutch was completed, the male detached and moved to another leaf, where he called 13 times. Meanwhile, the female moved back slowly and covered the eggs with her body for 25 minutes. There were 61 eggs in the clutch, and they were positioned in such a way that when the tadpoles hatched, they would fall into the water below. ==Status== This frog has a somewhat restricted range extending to about or less. The main threats it faces include deforestation, logging, the introduction of predatory fish into the streams where it lives and pollution resulting from agricultural activities. However, it is an abundant and adaptable species, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\", as any decrease in population sizes is likely to be at too slow a rate to be sufficient to classify it in a more threatened category. ==References== grandisonae Category:Amphibians of the Andes Category:Amphibians of Colombia Category:Amphibians of Ecuador Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot Category:Amphibians described in 1970 ","title":"Nymphargus grandisonae"},{"id":"12365065","text":"\\"Centrolene\\" guanacarum is a species of frog in the family Centrolenidae.

St Robert's Cave Robert of Knaresborough (St. Robert, born Robert Flower, 24 September 1218) was a British hermit who lived in a cave by the River Nidd, Knaresborough, North Yorkshire. His feast day is 24 September. == Life == He was born Robert Flower (Floure or Fleur), the son of Touk Flower, mayor of York, in York in 1160. Very early in his life he became a sub-deacon and a novice at the Cistercian Newminster Abbey, but he stayed there only a few months. Seeking a life of solitude, he visited a knight-hermit who lived in a cave by the River Nidd at Knaresborough, hiding from Richard I. On the death of the king, the knight returned home to his family leaving Robert on his own. The cave had a small chapel dedicated to St. Giles built around it. He continued to live there for some years, until a wealthy widow, Juliana, offered him a cell at St. Hilda‚Äôs Chapel in nearby Rudfarlington. There, he developed a reputation as a wise and holy man who cared for the poor. He stayed just a year before his hermitage was destroyed by bandits. Robert, dispossessed of his home, lived for a time under the church wall at Spofforth, and then he tried living with the monks at Hedley, near Tadcaster, but he found them far too easygoing for his style of life. By this time, the area had calmed down and he returned to Rudfarlington. Robert was well known for his charity to the poor and destitute. His favorite form of charity was to redeem men from prison. For a time, Robert prospered, having four servants and keeping cattle, but he was soon in trouble again, this time with William de Stuteville, the constable of Knaresborough castle, who accused him of harbouring thieves and outlaws. Having his hermitage destroyed for the second time, this time by the forces of law and order under William de Stuteville, Robert returned to the cave at Knaresborough, where he stayed for the rest of his life. As a hermit, Knaresborough lived on a diet of herbs, roots and water.Nichols, John. (1812). Literary Anecdotes of the Eighteenth Century, Volume 3. London. p. 723; Fletcher, Joseph Smith. (1899). A Picturesque History of Yorkshire. London. p. 227 Although living as a recluse, his pi√´ty soon attracted followers and gifts from local benefactors, gifts that included land alongside the river. A number of stories of St. Robert exist both in Latin and early English verse. One concerns his complaining about the King‚Äôs deer eating his crops. Sir William, making fun of the saint, invites Robert to catch the offending beasts. Robert manages not only to herd the deer into his barn as if they were a tame flock of sheep but also harnesses them to his plough and sets them to work. Robert died on 24 September 1218.; Before his death, St Robert established an order of Trinitarian Friars at Knaresborough Priory, but he warned them that, when his time came, the monks of Fountains Abbey would try to carry his body away to their own establishment. He urged his followers to resist them, which they did, and so St. Robert was buried in his chapel cut from the steep rocky crags by the river, where, it was said, a medicinal oil flowed from his tomb; pilgrims came from near and far to be healed by it. ==St. Robert's Cave== Robert lived in various places in the vicinity of Knaresborough before taking up residence in a cave by the River Nidd (then known as St. Giles' Priory). It is said that King John visited him and Trinitarian friars also venerated him.Maurice Turner A Brief History of Knaresborough 1990 Towards the end of his life, pilgrims flocked to see Robert to seek spiritual guidance and to be healed of physical ailments. His brother Walter, then Mayor of York, came and paid for some new buildings, including a chapel dedicated to the Holy Cross. The floorplan of this can still be seen alongside Robert‚Äôs cave in Knaresborough. ==St. Robert's Well== Sign at St Robert's Cave Michael Calvert's History of Knaresborough (1844) describes St Robert's Well as being near the York Road, about one mile from the town. Calvert also writes that prior to 1791 it had been an open well about two feet deep, but in 1791 bathing facilities were built at the well because of its value as a cold bath. An 1850s OS map marks a \\"Cold Bath\\" near the York Road, as described by Calvert, and this site was connected by a track to St Robert's cave and chapel to the south-west. The Monkswell business park was built on the site of St Robert's well or Cold Bath, where a well shaft preserves the site of the spring that fed it. Visitors drop coins (as well as litter) through the metal grid that covers the wellshaft. ==Veneration== St. Robert's feast day is on 24 September although he was never officially canonised.

It is also known as Pichincha giant glass frog or bumpy glassfrog. ==Distribution== In Colombia it has been recorded from the western slopes of the Cordillera Occidental, in the Cauca, Risaralda, and Valle del Cauca Departments. In Ecuador it has been recorded from the western Andes in the Pichincha and Santo Domingo de los Ts√°chilas Provinces. ==Description== Centrolene heloderma are small frogs (although among the generally small Centrolene, they are relatively large): males measure in snout‚Äìvent length and females (based on one frog only). It has uniformly green dorsum covered with whitish tubercles. Its snout has a characteristic obtuse profile. Females lay clutches up to 29 eggs on the upper side of leaves and very high from the water level. Upon hatching, the tadpoles drop down and develop in fast-flowing water. ==Habitat and conservation== Centrolene heloderma inhabits the upper elevations of cloud forest, and is only found in mature forest. It is an uncommon frog that is active at night and difficult to see. However, males can be heard calling from the vegetation near streams and waterfalls. In Ecuador Centrolene heloderma has disappeared from two known locations (including the type locality where it was last seen in 1979) and is now only known from one location. In Colombia it was last recorded in 1996. Its disappearance has been attributed to changing climatic patterns, with habitat loss, alien predatory fish, pollution, and chytridiomycosis as other potential contributing factors. ==References== heloderma Category:Amphibians of the Andes Category:Amphibians of Colombia Category:Amphibians of Ecuador Category:Amphibians described in 1981 Category:Taxa named by William Edward Duellman Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Centrolene heloderma"},{"id":"12365072","text":"Centrolene hesperia is a species of frog in the family Centrolenidae.

They specialised in novelty and souvenir items and their products can still be found in antique centres, fairs and shops all over Britain. Scarborough Pottery closed in 1983 following a down- turn in the ceramics industry.

This species can be found in Ecuador, Colombia, Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and Honduras. Its natural habitats are lowland tropical forests and montane cloud forests. It is a nocturnal species occurring in low vegetation in mature forests only. It is not considered threatened overall by the IUCN although deforestation and pollution are potential threats, as is chytridiomycosis. The word \\"prosoblepon\\" originates from the Greek words \\"proso\\" and \\"blepo\\", which respectively mean \\"forward, in front\\" and \\"see, look‚Äù, and is thought to signify the frontal position of the eyes in the emerald glass frog. General Description Centrolene prosoblepon is listed as least concern according to IUCN in the red list category and criteria when it was assessed in 2008. It was listed as least concern because of its wide distribution, large population, and its improbable decline. [4][5] The emerald glass frog has a lifespan of more than 5 years. It is physically described to be small, green, and may occasionally have dark spots on its back. It has a translucent body for camouflage, green bones and both males and females have humeral hooks (larger in males) which they use for fighting. [7] It is native to Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama. [4] It breeds during rainy season (May to November) and the males tend to be territorial. [5] The space between male territories are dependent on calling. [5] As for calling, the males will call from leaf branches. [5] Morphology Espadarana prosoblepon is considered to be medium in size, measuring 2.1-2.8 cm in males and 2.5-3.1 cm in females. [5] During the tadpole phase, its length is around 1.2 cm and has dorsal eyes and nostrils. [5] It is distinguished from the other glass frogs by having a protruding humeral spine in males and membranes between fingers 3 and 4 of its hand. [3] In terms of sexual dimorphism; males have humeral hooks. [6] In terms of size, males are around 0.11g, and snout to vent are about 2.5 cm. Male body size and humeral spine size is different among individuals, but these qualities don't determine success during aggressive interactions. The head of Espadarana prosoblepon is wide and seems round when observed overhead. [5] Its eyes are large and protruding with a small space between the eyes. [5] It does not have a tympanum (or cannot be seen). [5] It has vomerine teeth and due to its translucent smooth skin, its bones and intestines are visible (intestines less so due to white membrane cover). [5] Its fingers vary in length (finger 1 is longer than finger 2) and are webbed. [5] Colouration While the morphology of Espadarana prosoblepon is relatively consistent, its coloration pattern is especially variable. [3] These variable patterns and colorations include populations that are yellow, black and green. [3] During the tadpole phase its color is black and then later changes to brown/red. Its dorsal exteriors are emerald green (hence the name) and may have black specks. [5] The color of its fingers is faintly paler than the rest of its body and its bones are green due to biliverdin presence. [5] The iris is usually gray or silver with dark outlines. [5] Reproduction The emerald green frog, like most other frogs, are oviparous and polygynandrous. Their mating season lasts from May to November, which is the wet season in their region. [6] Some studies suggest that there is a positive correlation between rainfall and number of clutches laid. Mating Males tend to have high fidelity to their ovipository sites. During mating season, the male establishes his territory in a tree, usually on a leaf, and emits a call to attract females to his site. He defends this territory throughout the time he is searching for a mate as well as after the eggs are deposited for a period of time. [7] When a female approaches, the male engages her in amplexus and continues calling. This lasts for about 174 minutes and the calls are strongest during amplexus and after egg deposition.[7] The mating pair may stay in one location or move up to 2 m away from the original site. [5] Males generally tend to one clutch at a time, but have been reported to tend to up to four at a time. [7] The female deposits her eggs on the upper side of a leaf, a mossy rocks or branches, generally 0‚Äì3 m above the water. [5] Once the female deposits her eggs they are fertilized by the male's sperm, the male may rub his legs on the sides of the female's body, and she may stay for minutes or hours, and then leaves without returning. [5][7] Although large male size does not seem to be correlated with mating success, larger females tend to lay clutches with more eggs in them. This reproductive behavior is generally constant throughout emerald glass frog's range. [10] Development These frogs begin as eggs laid on land, develop as aquatic tadpoles, then return to land in their adult life stage. After deposition, the eggs take 8‚Äì20 days to develop. Tadpoles drop into the water underneath them and are often born when it is raining, which is said to be a camouflage technique. The hatchlings are 12mm in length, and have specialized mouth parts for attaching to substrate in the stream. After hatching they congregate and remain in the leaf litter and sediment for several months and once they are fully developed into adults they become terrestrial animals. [7][8] Egg clutches Eggs are laid in clutches of 10 to 40 eggs and are black in color, and each about 10mm in diameter. [8][5] The eggs are deposited together and form a jelly covered monolayer that is usually about 50 mm in diameter. [5] Parental care Females generally exhibit less parental care than males do. A female may remain near her eggs for a period of time up to several hours after deposition, but males have been reported to guard the eggs as they guard their territory. There has been no evidence that female parental care benefits the clutch, whereas male parental care has been seen to increase success. [7] Habitat Emerald glass frogs prefer humid terrestrial or aquatic habitats in rainforests and wet forests. They have both terrestrial and aquatic life stages, so they tend to live in vegetation beside streams. They prefer shallow streams because there are more rocks and logs that have vegetation on them for depositing eggs, where less flooding occurs. [6][7] Distribution and Range The range of the emerald glass frog is from eastern Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama, to the Pacific slopes of Colombia and Ecuador. [6][4][5][3] In Colombia, it is found in the northern and eastern areas (along Cordillera Oriental and in the Magdalena Valley). [4][3] It is also found along the Caribbean and along the Pacific slopes. [5][3] It is frequently recorded in Costa Rica. [4] It has declined drastically in Monteverde, Costa Rica since the mid 1980s. [4] While this may require further investigation, recorded declines in Costa Rica might be due to the chytridiomycosis disease. [4] Different Costa Rican populations have shown stability and, in some places, (Zarcero for example), the emerald glass frog is the most common glass frog within the area. [4] Moreover, it is shown to be common in Panama, Nicaragua, Ecuador and reasonably common in Honduras and Colombia. [4] It currently has a stable population trend and is not considered to be fragmented. [4] Strong site fidelity has been shown by the emerald glass frog, and its preferred system is terrestrial and freshwater. [4] As for the home range; the emerald glass frog shows strong fidelity within around 2 meters, and it is suggested that migration is a possibility. [7] Furthermore, studies have shown that the activity of males and females increased with rainfall. [10] # Altitude Centrolene prosoblepon is found at elevations ranging from 20-1,500 meters in zones that are humid such as forests and rainforests. [5][3] It appears to be more common at higher altitudes due to the presence of more stream habitats near rivers and streams. [4] It has been found that the maximum elevation limit 1500 meters (above sea level). [4][3] In terms of habitat in these altitudes, the emerald glass frog prefers vegetated areas that are dense such as evergreen forests along banks of rapid streams where it breeds by laying its eggs on nearby leaves. [5] Behaviour The emerald glass frog's activity is nocturnal, and increased during rainfall.[6][10] Males are territorial and have high site fidelity which can lead to aggression. In the event of combat, males have humeral hooks that they use for grappling with other males. [6][4] Feeding Adults are carnivorous, primarily eating insects, whereas tadpoles can be both carnivorous and herbivorous. Tadpoles eat algae, aquatic invertebrates as well as other tadpoles. [7] Fighting Male emerald glass frogs have large humeral spines that they use for combat. The size varies amongst individuals and tends to be correlated with who wins the interaction. [9] If a male's territory is encroached upon the two males will engage in a grappling match that can last up to 30 minutes. [5] This is more common in areas of high male density than in areas of low male density. [9] Males in combat hang by their toes on the same or nearby vegetation and seize each other front to front, hooking their humeral hooks in the other's axial region. When this ritual is over, the males may make a peep sound, or simply jump to another location on the tree. The aggressive interaction is over when one male jumps to another (lower) leaf or flattens his body against the leaf signifying submissiveness. [7] Calling Though most vocal during the wet season, it has been reported that these frogs call throughout the year. [8] The call is used to attract a female to his territory and consists of short ‚Äúchee-chee-chee‚Äù, with intermittent chirp sequences. The rate of this call ranges from 1 to 43 calls per hour, with a duration of 1.5‚Äì3 seconds. [5] The call is most intense whilst engaged in amplexus as well as after egg deposition. [7] When a male is in close proximity to another male, they call in a short series of rapid beeps. [7] Higher mating success has been seen to be correlated to longer length of calling. [10] History In the past thirty years there has been a major decline (about 40%) in amphibian populations in South America, with the emerald tree frog among them. This sudden population drop was strange and perplexing because there was very little disturbance in the area. After some research in the affected areas, there was speculation that the decline was a result of the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, which causes chytridiomycosis in amphibians. Espadarana prosoblepon populations have remained relatively stable after the major population decline, keeping them on the IUCN species of least concern list. [6][4] Threats The emerald glass frog substantially declined in Monteverde, Costa Rica since the 1980s, though it has shown stability in other near areas. [5] There may be multiple causes for the decline including habitat destruction, negative agriculture, chemical implementation and disease. [4][5] Centrolene prosoblepon is threatened by Chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis) which causes chytridiomycosis that disrupts its skin and respiratory system. [6][7] Some frogs tend to be less threatened by Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis due to the variation in their physiology. [7] The emerald glass frog was able to persist during its decline which indicates high resistance to Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. [7] Another threat is a chytrid collapse, which is when the majority of the population rapidly declines while a few persist. [8] There is very little information regarding predation but crabs and other small predators such as spiders have been reported to feed on Centrolene prosoblepon. [7] Generally, threats to the emerald glass frogs are related to its habitat such as deforestation, human intrusion and pollution resulting from illegal crop spraying. [4][5] Conservation An example of conserving Centrolene prosoblepon is evident in Ecuador because its distribution overlaps with reserves such as the Mache- Chindul Ecological Reserve and the Cotacachi Cayapas Ecological Reserve. [4][3] It is also found in many protected areas in Colombia and within its range in Central America. [4][3] The emerald glass frog generally has a wide distribution and consists of large populations which is why it has not attracted conservation efforts.

In 2013, the first record of its presence in Peru was recorded, it having been found in Bahuaja-Sonene National Park in the southeast of the country. ==Ecology== In the breeding season, males call from near fast-flowing streams, either from rocks in the streambed, or from foliage up to a few meters above the water. Up to six males may call in chorus, spaced out a few centimetres apart. The calls are either single high-pitched \\"pinks\\" at irregular intervals, or groups of three \\"pinks\\" in quick succession. Females lay clutches of eggs on wet boulders. ==Status== In its limited range in Bolivia, this species is common, but it is threatened by pollution of the streams where it breeds which can suffer from agricultural run-off, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated it as \\"near- threatened\\".

Records from newspaper clippings show that the first State A1 Premiers were the YWCA. The year was 1922, four years before the first recorded interstate match and six years prior to the first official All Australia Carnival. The first recorded Interstate Carnival was held in Sydney and NSW was the winner. It was after this carnival that a move to form the All Australia Women‚Äôs Basketball Association was made. The inaugural meeting took place in 1927 where a Chairman, Honorary Secretary and two delegates from each of the five State organisations formed a Council. A uniform set of rules was established and the first official All Australia Carnival was organized in 1928. The All Australia Women‚Äôs Basketball Association came into being with foundation members of State Associations from New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Victoria and Western Australia. Western Australia competed at the 1929 Carnival but did not reaffiliate or compete again until 1939, and Tasmania affiliated and competed from 1933 onwards. ==Current organisation== Netball SA today is an affiliated member of Netball Australia and comprises over 30,000 players who are directly linked to clubs and associations affiliated with Netball SA. Netball SA provides South Australians with the opportunity to participate in the game of netball from junior levels to elite competition through its Member Associations. Netball SA is committed to ensuring netball in South Australia achieves consistent success, a strong and positive public profile and continuing player and spectator support at all levels. Netball SA is governed by Board of Management, the current board is made up of Netball SA CEO Stephanie Greene, President Graeme Gilbert, Alex Howieson, former Australian Netball player Jennifer Borlase, Mayor of Playford Council Glenn Docherty, Lynda Matthews, Marlene Elliott, Susan Comerford and Tanya Denning who meet monthly respectively. The Netball SA Board is chosen by \\"The Council\\" which is made up of representatives from 35 Member Associations across the state and two foundation divisions (Adelaide Metropolitan and City Night). The Netball Council meets quarterly. == Press clippings == ‚Äì From Edwards Park to ETSA Park * March 1939 - 100 delegates of SAWBA unanimously agreed to the executive‚Äôs proposal to establish a sports park in the west parklands. The area which has been made available to the Association by the City Council, will home 12 basketball courts with a central dressing shed. * April 1939 - Cost of constructing the new park was one hundred pounds and the courts had to be weeded and lined before each game. * May 1947 - The dirt courts on the sports park at Keswick became quagmires in the first round of games and many of the teams which followed on after the 2:00 pm series were forced to postpone their matches. * April 1955 - A warm day and heavy courts (the new surfacing had not hardened) made the going rather difficult but teams managed to put speed into their games and matches were of a high standard. * April 1957 - 17 courts being used. Six bitumised since last season at a cost of 1060 pounds. * 1973 - A loan was sought from the Adelaide City Council for $14,000 to resurface courts (which was later paid back to the Council). * 1986 - Netball SA paid $37,000 to resurface six courts. * 1990 - Netball SA paid $83,245 to resurface 10 courts ‚Äì involved a $50,000 loan from Adelaide City Council at current market rates. Netball SA also paid the Adelaide City Council a Parks Permit each year. In September 1995 Netball SA paid $1660. * March 1998 - Netball SA entered into an agreement with the Government of South Australia to fund a world class netball facility in Adelaide and hence, ETSA Park was born. * 2001 - The Netball SA Board was formed to set and manage the strategic affairs of Netball SA. * January 2005 - The 26 outdoor netball courts at ETSA Park were resurfaced. * August 2005 - The South Australian government announced it will fund the construction of shelter areas for ETSA Park‚Äôs 26 outdoor netball courts at a cost of $250,000.

It is found in Amazonian Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru, and in southern Guyana, eastern Surinam, and French Guiana. Its natural habitats are tropical moist lowland forests and rivers. It is threatened by habitat loss. Formerly, this species was considered to be distinct from Vitreorana oyampiensis, but now the two populations are considered as conspecific. ==Description== Vitreorana ritae is a tiny glassfrog that lacks humeral spines in males and has a lobed liver. Adult males measure 17‚Äì21 mm from the snout to the vent, while the females are a bit larger at about 19.5-24.5 mm snout-vent length. Its snout tip is neatly rounded. The translucent eardrum is visible but not large, measuring about one-fourth to one-third of the eye's diameter; the tympanic annulus is not hidden except for the dorsal margin which is covered by the supratympanic fold.Guayasamin et al. (2008), Kok & Castroviejo-Fisher (2008) Their color looks pale green above, but in fact this is much due to their green skeleton being visible through the weakly pigmented skin. This species has many clear and fine blackish spots decorating its upperside, which may appear as if they were suspended a bit above the greenish background in very weakly pigmented specimens. Helena's glass frog, V. helenae on the other hand has a more heavily pigmented yellowish-green upperside (but also the characteristic spots, which led to them being confused). The back has a smooth shagreen-like texture, while the entirely transparent belly skin has a grainy surface. The forward quarter to half of the parietal (outer) peritoneum is white, while the rest is transparent, allowing to see the frog's interior. The pericardium and the inner peritoneum covering the gastrointestinal tract are white, while the inner peritoneum protecting the brown lobes of the liver is also transparent except for the anterior tip (where some iridophores may be present). The iris is greyish white with a network of thin dark grey lines; in Helena's glass frog it is bright yellow. Melanophores are abundant on the dorsal surface of the two outer but absent on the two inner fingers. Preserved specimens are lavender above, with the dark spotting remaining unchanged; the white iridophores of the viscera can dissolve in preserved specimens. The dentigerous process of the vomer carries one tooth at most; it can be entirely toothless. The males have a type-I nuptial pad; the prepollex stands out at the base of the first finger. The toes and the outer two fingers of V. ritae are webbed; the first two fingers (of which the first is a bit longer) are completely free. The webbing formula for the outer fingers is III (2‚àí-21/3) - (1+-2‚àí) IV; for the toes, it is I 1 - (2‚àí-2) II (1-1+) - (2-21/4) III (1+-11/2) - 2+ IV (2-21/3) - 1 V. The disc at the tip of the third finger is mid-sized, larger than the eardrum but less than half the diameter of the eye. This species has tubercles on the thighs below the vent, but only low folds with no iridophores on the ulna and inner tarsus. ==Ecology== Its natural habitats are tropical moist lowland forests and rivers; it is usually found in riparian vegetation. Occurring at elevations below 1,000 m ASL; it is apparently also absent from the coastlands up to some dozen meters above sea level.La Marca & Reynolds (2008) The calls of this species have supposedly been described at least twice, but it is not clear whether they are actually of V. ritae; one description appears to be of C. midas calls instead. The other notes that the males call sitting on the upperside of leaves, usually giving very brief (0.10‚Äì0.15 seconds) calls that are loudest around 4640‚Äì5160 Hz singly or doubly, but apparently never three in a row - Helena's glass frog (V. helenae) gives double or triple but apparently never single calls. It is unknown if and how the males physically fight for females. The clutches are deposited on either side of leaves above small streams; after hatching the tadpoles drop into the water. Other aspects of its reproduction, as well as its tadpoles, remain undescribed as of 2008.Guayasamin et al. (2008), Kok & Castroviejo-Fisher (2008), La Marca & Reynolds (2008) Though tiny and inconspicuous, it is not considered a particularly rare species. With a considerable range including several protected areas and apparently able to live in secondary forest and tolerate some amount of human use of its habitat, it is not considered threatened by the IUCN. ==Systematics and taxonomy== This frog has a complicated taxonomic history: it was initially described in the genus Centrolenella, which is nowadays included in Centrolene. In 2009, it was transferred further to Vitreorana. In 2008, it was found to include that the frogs that had been described as Centrolenella ametarsia are indistinguishable from the present species. The holotype of this species is specimen MNHNP 1973.1673, that of C. ametarsia is specimen MCZ A96522. In 2013, Vitreorana oyampiensis was formally synonymized with Vitreorana ritae. ==References== * (2008): Taxonomic identity of Cochranella petersi Goin, 1961 and Centrolenella ametarsia Flores, 1987.

They are small, green frogs with many similarities to other glass frogs, however they have the most transparent undersides of any glass frogs. Their transparent undersides make them ideal bio-indicators for how global warming and other threats are affecting the animals in the forests. == Characteristics == thumb Bare-hearted glass frogs are similar in features to most glass frogs but have their own distinct characteristics. Like most glass frogs, they are small and green with yellow spots, and transparent undersides. The transparent undersides are the main feature of most glass frogs, but the bare-hearted glass frog has the clearest underside, allowing almost full visibility of their internal organs. Their transparent skin also makes them difficult to see, as well as their size. They are very small, with male frogs being 22‚Äì27 mm long and females 24.5‚Äì29 mm long. Other distinct characteristics of bare-hearted glass frogs are their forward-facing golden eyes and nostrils raised from their heads. They spend time moving throughout the forests and streams, their front fingers being less webbed and more isolated, while their back feet are heavily webbed, allow them mobility in trees and in water. Bare-hearted glass frog tadpoles are very small, less than 9.5 mm. They are brown with light undersides and have long bodies with pointed tails for swimming while they mature in the streams. == Habitat == The bare-hearted glass frog is found in Honduras (Olancho Department), central and southeastern Costa Rica, Panama, and western Colombia along the western slopes of Cordillera Occidental. They live near streams, or other bodies of water, that are surrounded by rainforests. During breeding season they live beside or directly above streams on leaves and bush that dangle over the water in order for eggs to hatch into the stream. The Costa Rican Amphibian Research Center (CRARC), founded by Brian Kubicki, has found that they live higher in trees or near waterfalls while not in breeding season. There is not much research on what they eat, but like most frogs they probably eat small insects. Since they rely on the presence of trees, they are most threatened by the destruction of their habitat from deforestation. Even though they face threats to their environment, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, they are considered to be \\"least concern\\" for extinction. However, with many other glass frogs declining in population, bare-hearted glass frogs are also at risk. Global warming is also a threat to bare-hearted glass frogs. They need moisture and rain in order to not dry out, and lack of rain or warmer conditions can be dangerous. Biologists are interested in further researching and observing bare-hearted glass frogs as they can be good bio-indicators of how global warming is affecting, not only frogs, but other species in rainforests. == Breeding == Breeding season is during rainy season, from late fall to spring. The process of breeding starts with males selecting a leaf or bush near a stream as their calling ground. Then they call to attract females, the sound is similar to a cricket, which is where they get one of their common names from. They stay in one spot to call from and will fight other males for territory and to win females. The fights between males are over a specific leaf or calling area and are won by one male pinning the other down. Once they attract a female, the eggs are laid on the underside of a leaf. Batches are 50-75 eggs, and are laid under leaves above streams where they are cared for by the male. The male's responsibility is to protect and keep the eggs moist, he does this through urination and osmosis (a process where water passes through the skin). Due to the nocturnal nature of the frogs, the male guards the batch during the night but eggs are stolen by wasps when they are not guarded. The wasps steal the eggs one at a time and can steal entire batches while the eggs are not guarded during the day. The eggs are cared for and mature while on the leaf for about two weeks. Once the eggs hatch, they either wiggle until they drop into the streams or are washed off the leaves by the rain in to the streams, where they finish their larval development. ==References== colymbiphyllum Category:Frogs of North America Category:Frogs of South America Category:Amphibians of Colombia Category:Amphibians of Costa Rica Category:Amphibians of Honduras Category:Amphibians of Panama Category:Least concern biota of North America Category:Least concern biota of South America Category:Amphibians described in 1949 Category:Taxa named by Edward Harrison Taylor Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Hyalinobatrachium colymbiphyllum"},{"id":"12365516","text":"Hyalinobatrachium duranti is a species of frog in the family Centrolenidae.

It is found in the tropical Americas from southern Mexico to Ecuador. Specifically, these frogs occur in Mexico, Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama, Colombia, and Ecuador. Notice that this and related species have often been confused with each other, and the exact distribution depends on the source. ==Etymology== The specific name fleischmanni honors Carl Fleischmann, a collector in Costa Rica in the 1890s. ==Description== Glass frogs have similarities to tree frogs. They look very close to the naked eye except glass frog's eyes point forward and are golden. During the day, these frogs camouflage themselves under leaves but above water. Male glass frogs are 19‚Äì28 mm long while females measure from 23‚Äì32 mm long. They have a green semi-translucent color with yellow translucent hands. Their skin has dots which matches that of the leaves in the area. When confronted or approached, they tend to freeze up and not move. It is not specifically known what the glass frog eats, but it is assumed that they feed on small insects. Also known as the Northern Glass Frog, this frog's physical features include primarily green skin, pale yellowish spots, yellow fingertips and translucent skin covering its stomach. A sheet of guanine stretches over several internal organs, such as the heart, but leaves others parts such as the liver exposed for viewing as it only covers half of the frog's underbelly. They also possess a white vocal sac that can be used to produce sounds for mating. Male frogs have a noticeable hook protruding from its spine, presumably used to fight other frogs, defend its territory or the eggs. They are fierce fighters who will occasionally engage in a wrestling match with other intruding frogs. The female species are slightly larger and lacks this particular feature. There have been more than 100 reported glass frogs throughout Central and South America. 13 species can be found in Costa Rica. Adults tend to be more active during the night when there is rain to keep their skin moist and from drying out. However, strong rains can kill them because their bodies are so fragile. A simple direct shot from a raindrop has been known to kill a glass frog. ==Habitat== Fleischmann's Glass Frogs live near fast streams. In Costa Rica, these frogs live in lowland wet forests, rain forests, and even in higher elevations. They do not like dry areas such as the northwestern lowlands, high mountains, or coasts. Of all the glass frogs in Costa Rica, Fleischmann's glass frogs are the most populous. The glass frogs are also arboreal, which means they reside in trees. These frogs tend to lay their eggs on lower branches, the bottom of leaves and near flowing water. About 18‚Äì30 eggs could be laid, and the male frog would stand guard over the eggs to protect them from predators until they hatch, and the tadpoles drop into the water. During mating season, the males would call out to the females, and once a relationship has been established, the highly territorial males would display another call to warn competitors away. Should any potential threats not back away, the frogs would fight until a winner is determined. The victor would be able to reproduce with the female. ==Breeding== The glass frog's reproduction cycle beings during the rainy season, and is sometime between May to October. The number of eggs is dependent on the time of year they are laid. A large number of the egg's natural predators means that roughly 80% of the clutches are eaten and/or destroyed. The male frog takes precautions to keep his eggs safe, such as defending them, or urinating on the eggs to ensure that they do not dry out. The eggs hatch after approximately 10‚Äì15 days. The tadpoles that fall into the water usually remain hidden in debris at the bottom of the stream. Their growth is time-consuming, and it takes between 1‚Äì2 years for the tadpoles to fully mature. Some risks the eggs face are infections by fungus, or being eaten by larger predators such as crickets and possums. ==References== fleischmanni Category:Frogs of North America Category:Frogs of South America Category:Amphibians of Belize Category:Amphibians of Colombia Category:Amphibians of Costa Rica Category:Amphibians of Ecuador Category:Amphibians of El Salvador Category:Amphibians of Guatemala Category:Amphibians of Honduras Category:Amphibians of Mexico Category:Amphibians of Nicaragua Category:Amphibians of Panama Category:Least concern biota of North America Category:Least concern biota of South America Category:Amphibians described in 1893 Category:Taxa named by Oskar Boettger Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Hyalinobatrachium fleischmanni"},{"id":"12365556","text":"Hyalinobatrachium fragile is a species of frog in the family Centrolenidae.

Many individuals from the Sierra de Perij√° have a number of irregular black flecks on the dorsum, head, and dorsal surfaces of the limbs. ==Habitat and conservation== In the Sierra de Perij√°, Hyalinobatrachium pallidum was abundant and reproductively active at two localities with small fast-flowing creeks surrounded by primary cloud forest and abundant stream-side vegetation. It was scarce at a third locality, a small creek in secondary forest with shaded coffee plantations. The Guacharaquita population was considered almost extirpated by habitat loss in the assessment by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in 2004. However, Rojas-Runjaic and colleagues suggest that the conservation status of this species should be reassessed in light of broader distribution than was known at the time of the assessment. ==References== pallidum Category:Amphibians of the Andes Category:Amphibians of Venezuela Category:Endemic fauna of Venezuela Category:Taxa named by Juan A.

It is found in lower montane rainforests on the Amazonian Andean slopes in Ecuador and Peru. The specific name pellucidum is Latin for \\"transparent\\" and refers to the transparent parietal peritoneum of this species. ==Description== This frog is about the size of a fingernail: males measure and females about in snout‚Äìvent length. The snout is truncated. The tympanum is partially hidden under skin. Dorsal skin is slightly granular. The dorsum is pale green with diffuse yellow dots. The fingers and toes are yellow and partly webbed. Lower surfaces are unpigmented and the heart is visible through the parietal peritoneum. The iris is pale silver bronze. The male advertisement call is a single, monotone note, without amplitude modulation. ==Habitat and conservation== Its natural habitats are lower montane rainforests, cloud forests, as well as old-growth and secondary forests at elevations of above sea level. Individuals have been found at night on the upper surfaces of leaves of trees and herbs, about 1.5 to 4 metres above streams. Egg clutches are laid in vegetation where they may fall victim to predation from spiders. The species is threatened by habitat loss caused by smallholder farming and logging. Ex-situ conservation programs have begun to help save this interesting creature. ==References== pellucidum Category:Amphibians of the Andes Category:Amphibians of Ecuador Category:Amphibians of Peru Category:Amphibians described in 1973 Category:Taxa named by William Edward Duellman Category:Taxa named by John Douglas Lynch Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Hyalinobatrachium pellucidum"},{"id":"12365629","text":"The powdered glass frog or Chiriqui glass frog, Teratohyla pulverata, is a frog species in the glass frog family (Centrolenidae). It is found from north- central Honduras south to northwestern Ecuador.Sol√≠s et al. (2010)Frost, 2014 ==Description== Teratohyla pulverata is a small glass frog, lacking humeral spines in males, and has a lobed bulbous liver, placing it in the genus Cochranella. Adult males measure 22-24.5 mm from the snout to the vent, while the females are larger at 25.3-28.3 mm snout-vent length. The snout is rounded if seen from above, but presents a distinctly sloped profile when viewed from the side. The translucent tympanum is visible but not large, measuring about one-fifth to one-fourth of the eye's diameter; the tympanic annulus is not hidden except for the dorsal margin, which is covered by the supratympanic fold.Guayasamin et al. (2008) Their color is green above, with a rich scattering of small, white spots ‚Äì hence the species' scientific name, which means \\"the powdered one\\". The back has a rough shagreen-like texture, particularly in males, where it is covered in tiny spicules. The belly is transparent and has a grained texture. Thus, the green bones and some internal organs can be observed in the living animal ‚Äì particularly as this species' parietal (outer) peritoneum is completely translucent, too; the inner peritonea covering the liver and gastrointestinal tract are white. The iris is greyish-white with tiny yellow dots and a network of thin, dark-grey lines; a thin cream-yellow ring surrounds the pupil. Melanophores are abundant on the dorsal surface of the fourth finger, but absent on the first three fingers. Preserved specimens are usually cream-colored to light lavender above, with the spotting remaining white or becoming transparent. The dentigerous process of the vomer carries two to four teeth. The males have a type-I nuptial pad; the prepollex is concealed. The toes and most fingers of C. pulverata are webbed; the webbing between the first two fingers (which are of equal length) is absent or vestigial, however. The webbing formula for the outer fingers is II (1+-11/3) ‚Äì (24/5-3‚àí) III (11/3-12/3) ‚Äì (1+-2‚àí) IV; for the toes, it is I (1‚àí-1) ‚Äì (12/3-2‚àí) II (1‚àí-1) ‚Äì (13/4-2‚àí) III (1-1+) ‚Äì (12/3-2+) IV (2‚àí-2+) ‚Äì (1‚àí-1+) V. The discs at the finger and toe tips are small, about the size of the eardrum on the third finger. This species has no tubercles on the thighs; the metacarpus, ulna, metatarsus, and tarsus have tubercular folds, resulting in a wavy outline of the limbs. The tooth row formula of tadpoles is 2/3, with the A2 tooth row broadly separated in the center. ==Range and ecology== Its natural habitats are tropical moist lowland forests and rivers; it is mostly found in riparian vegetation. In the northern part of its range (south to the Isthmus of Panama approximately) it is found on the Atlantic side of the American Cordillera; on the Pacific side, it is found from Costa Rica southwards. It occurs up to 960 meters ASL in the northern parts of its range, but apparently only up to 300 m ASL in its southern haunts. The males call sitting on the upper sides of leaves, usually giving three notes of about 0.05 seconds duration with a dominant frequency of 5,600‚Äì6,200 Hz, separated by a 0.5‚Äì to 0.8-second pause from each other. It is unknown if and how they physically fight for females. The clutches are deposited on the upper sides of leaves above small streams; after hatching, the tadpoles drop into the water. The parents do not guard the eggs or care for their offspring otherwise. Moderately common in Honduras, it is uncommon in Costa Rica, and only rarely found in Colombia. Able to persist in small forest fragments, it is not considered threatened by the IUCN. ==Taxonomy== This frog, like many Centrolenidae, has a confusing taxonomic history. It was initially described as a tree frog of genus Hyla; on recognizing its true affiliations, it was variously placed in the genera Centrolene, Centrolenella (now included in Centrolene) and Hyalinobatrachium. In 2008, it was found to include the mysterious frog that had been described as Cochranella petersi, and was subsequently considered allied or identical to Fleischmann's glass frog (H. fleischmanni) or H. valerioi in error. In 2009, it was transferred to then- resurrected Teratohyla. Thus, the complete synonymy of this species is: * Centrolene pulveratum (Peters, 1873) * Centrolenella petersi (Goin, 1961) * Centrolenella pulverata (Peters, 1873) * Centrolenella pulveratum (Peters, 1873; lapsus) * Cochranella pulverata (Peters, 1873) * Cochranella petersi Goin, 1961 * Hyalinobatrachium petersi (Goin, 1961) * Hyalinobatrachium pulveratum (Peters, 1873) * Hyla pulverata Peters, 1873 The holotype of this species is specimen ZMB 7842, that of C. petersi is specimen BM 1902.5.27.24. ==FootnotesReferences== * * (2008): Taxonomic identity of Cochranella petersi Goin, 1961 and Centrolenella ametarsia Flores, 1987.

The dorsum is spotted yellow, with green reticulations between the spots. There might be some small dark spots in the green areas. The ventral surface is transparent, however the heart is covered by white tissue and is not visible. Also the liver and digestive tract are white. Their eye color is gold. Hyalinobatrachium valerioi glass frogs are carnivores, their diet mainly including small insects like crickets, moths, flies, spiders, and other smaller frogs. The egg clutches, containing no more than 40 eggs, are laid on the underside of leaves over streams. Contrary to most other glass frogs, the male remains with its egg clutches also during daylight hours, performing 24-hour egg attendance. ==Habitat and conservation== Its natural habitats are moist primary and secondary lowland forests. Adult frogs are typically found in bushes and trees along forest streams. The species tolerates some habitat modification, provided that vegetation over streams remains. Hyalinobatrachium valerioi is declining in parts of its range while it is considered stable in others.

In 1983 she graduated from the Junior College of Kinjo Gakuin University and became a kindergarten teacher. In September 2006 she became a secretary to Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) politician Takashi Kawamura, who represented Aichi 1st district in the House of Representatives of Japan's national Diet. == Political career == Sato contested the Nagoya City Higashi district of the Aichi Prefectural Assembly as a DPJ candidate in the April 2007 general election and claimed 58% of the vote. In April 2009 resigned from the House of Representatives to contest the Nagoya mayoral election. Sato subsequently resigned from the Prefectural Assembly in July 2009 in order to contest Kawamura's seat as the DPJ candidate at the August 2009 general election. Sato won 54.4% of the vote in an election that brought the DPJ into power for the first time in its existence. Sato lodged resignation papers with DPJ officials in March 2011 in order to allow her to campaign on behalf of Genzei Nippon (\\"Tax Reduction Japan\\"), a party formed by Kawamura in April 2010. The DPJ did not immediately accept her resignation and instead considered expelling her from the party, but eventually granted her request to leave in May 2011. This made her the new party's first member in the national Diet. The national branch of Genzei Nippon, including Sato, merged with the Tomorrow Party of Japan in November 2012. Sato contested the December 2012 general election as a Tomorrow Party candidate and received 31% of the vote, but lost to Liberal Democratic Party candidate Hiromichi Kumada, who received 40% of the vote. The Tomorrow Party received only 7% of the vote in the Tokai proportional representation block, which meant they only received 1 of the 21 seats available. Fellow Tomorrow Party candidate Katsumasa Suzuki lost the Aichi 15th district by a smaller margin than Sato lost her district, which meant that Suzuki claimed the sole PR block seat and Sato lost her place in the Diet. Sato returned to politics at the April 2015 unified local elections, winning one of the two seats in the Higashi district of the Nagoya city council and receiving 34.5% of the vote. == References External links== *Official website Category:Female members of the House of Representatives (Japan) Category:Members of the House of Representatives (Japan) Category:21st-century Japanese politicians Category:Members of the Aichi Prefectural Assembly Category:1963 births Category:Living people Category:21st-century Japanese women politicians ","title":"Yuko Sato (politician)"},{"id":"12365907","text":"Princess Victor of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, Princess Victor of Hohenlohe- Langenburg (Laura Williamina Seymour; 17 December 1832 - 13 February 1912)Burke's Peerage, 107th edition - \\"Hertford, Marquess of\\". was a British- born aristocrat whose marriage to a German prince naturalised in England made her a kinswoman of the British Royal Family and a member of the royal court. ==Ancestry== Laura Williamina Seymour was a daughter of Admiral Sir George Seymour and his wife, Georgiana Berkeley, a granddaughter of the 4th Earl of Berkeley and a great-granddaughter of the 2nd Duke of Richmond. Paternally, she descended in unbroken male line from the Seymours (originally, St. Maur) who belonged to the gentry of the 12th century, acquired considerable landed wealth by the marriage of Sir Roger de St. Maur to the baronial co-heiress Cecily Berkeley, and were raised to peerage in 1536 as Viscounts Beauchamp. Laura's direct ancestor, Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset, was the eldest brother of Henry VIII's queen consort, Jane Seymour, and had himself declared Lord Protector of England during the minority of their son, King Edward VI. The Dukedom of Somerset and the Marquessate of Hertford, eventually devolved upon her branch of the Seymour family. Laura Seymour descended three times from Charles II of England and once from James II of England (although severed from the Royal Family by bars sinister). Furthermore, she descended from Charles I Louis, Elector Palatine and from Maurice, Prince of Orange also by mistresses. ==Marriage== Nonetheless, her noble antecedents in the United Kingdom did not suffice to permit Laura to contract an equal marriage with a cadet of a German mediatised family of princely rank in 19th century Europe. Almost two weeks before her morganatic marriage to Prince Victor of Hohenlohe- Langenburg (a half-nephew of Queen Victoria who had served under her father's military command) on 26 January 1861, she was created Countess Gleichen by Ernst II, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. When the Countess von Gleichen's brother, Francis, inherited his cousin's Marquessate of Hertford in 1870, the Queen granted her the rank and style of the daughter of a marquess by Royal Warrant of Precedence, entitling her to prefix Lady to her name.London Gazette, 14 February 1871, p.2 However, she continued to use her comital title until 15 December 1885, when it was gazetted in the Court Circular that the Queen had granted her permission to share, within the British Empire, her husband's princely title. Henceforth she was known as HSH Princess Victor of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, although this changed neither her legal rank nor her title in the German Empire. In accordance with the original Coburg grant, her children were also Count/Countess von Gleichen and, although granted unique precedence before the daughters and younger sons of English dukes in 1913, they never received authorisation to share their parents' princely style at the Court of St. James's, and were known by their comital title (dropping, however, the von) until George V Anglicised their style in 1917, along with the styles of members of his own family who bore German titles. Princess Victor did not live to undergo that demotion in titulature. ==Children== Laura Seymour and Prince Victor had four children, the daughters becoming notable for their artistic endeavors and cultural patronage: *Lady Feodora (Feo) Georgina Maud Gleichen (20 December 1861 ‚Äì 22 February 1922); sculptor. *Lord Albert Edward Wilfred Gleichen (15 January 1863 ‚Äì 13 December 1937); soldier, married Hon.

Let \\\\mathbf{x} be a representation of a 3D point in homogeneous coordinates (a 4-dimensional vector), and let \\\\mathbf{y} be a representation of the image of this point in the pinhole camera (a 3-dimensional vector). Then the following relation holds : \\\\mathbf{y} \\\\sim \\\\mathbf{C} \\\\, \\\\mathbf{x} where \\\\mathbf{C} is the camera matrix and the \\\\, \\\\sim sign implies that the left and right hand sides are equal up to a non- zero scalar multiplication. Since the camera matrix \\\\mathbf{C} is involved in the mapping between elements of two projective spaces, it too can be regarded as a projective element. This means that it has only 11 degrees of freedom since any multiplication by a non-zero scalar results in an equivalent camera matrix. == Derivation == The mapping from the coordinates of a 3D point P to the 2D image coordinates of the point's projection onto the image plane, according to the pinhole camera model, is given by : \\\\begin{pmatrix} y_1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ y_2 \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\frac{f}{x_3} \\\\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ x_2 \\\\end{pmatrix} where (x_1, x_2, x_3) are the 3D coordinates of P relative to a camera centered coordinate system, (y_1, y_2) are the resulting image coordinates, and f is the camera's focal length for which we assume f > 0. Furthermore, we also assume that x3 > 0. To derive the camera matrix, the expression above is rewritten in terms of homogeneous coordinates. Instead of the 2D vector (y_1,y_2) we consider the projective element (a 3D vector) \\\\mathbf{y} = (y_1,y_2,1) and instead of equality we consider equality up to scaling by a non-zero number, denoted \\\\, \\\\sim . First, we write the homogeneous image coordinates as expressions in the usual 3D coordinates. : \\\\begin{pmatrix} y_1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ y_2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\frac{f}{x_3} \\\\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ x_2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{x_3}{f} \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\sim \\\\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ x_2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{x_3}{f} \\\\end{pmatrix} Finally, also the 3D coordinates are expressed in a homogeneous representation \\\\mathbf{x} and this is how the camera matrix appears: : \\\\begin{pmatrix} y_1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ y_2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\sim \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & \\\\frac{1}{f} & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\, \\\\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ x_2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ x_3 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 \\\\end{pmatrix} or \\\\mathbf{y} \\\\sim \\\\mathbf{C} \\\\, \\\\mathbf{x} where \\\\mathbf{C} is the camera matrix, which here is given by : \\\\mathbf{C} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & \\\\frac{1}{f} & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix} , and the corresponding camera matrix now becomes : \\\\mathbf{C} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & \\\\frac{1}{f} & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\sim \\\\begin{pmatrix} f & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & f & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix} The last step is a consequence of \\\\mathbf{C} itself being a projective element. The camera matrix derived here may appear trivial in the sense that it contains very few non-zero elements. This depends to a large extent on the particular coordinate systems which have been chosen for the 3D and 2D points. In practice, however, other forms of camera matrices are common, as will be shown below. == Camera position == The camera matrix \\\\mathbf{C} derived in the previous section has a null space which is spanned by the vector : \\\\mathbf{n} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 \\\\end{pmatrix} This is also the homogeneous representation of the 3D point which has coordinates (0,0,0), that is, the \\"camera center\\" (aka the entrance pupil; the position of the pinhole of a pinhole camera) is at O. This means that the camera center (and only this point) cannot be mapped to a point in the image plane by the camera (or equivalently, it maps to all points on the image as every ray on the image goes through this point). For any other 3D point with x_3 = 0, the result \\\\mathbf{y} \\\\sim\\\\mathbf{C}\\\\,\\\\mathbf{x} is well-defined and has the form \\\\mathbf{y} = (y_1\\\\,y_2\\\\,0)^\\\\top . This corresponds to a point at infinity in the projective image plane (even though, if the image plane is taken to be a Euclidean plane, no corresponding intersection point exists). == Normalized camera matrix and normalized image coordinates == The camera matrix derived above can be simplified even further if we assume that f = 1: : \\\\mathbf{C}_{0} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\left ( \\\\begin{array}{cc} \\\\mathbf{I} & \\\\mathbf{0} \\\\end{array} \\\\right ) where \\\\mathbf{I} here denotes a 3 \\\\times 3 identity matrix. Note that 3 \\\\times 4 matrix \\\\mathbf{C} here is divided into a concatenation of a 3 \\\\times 3 matrix and a 3-dimensional vector. The camera matrix \\\\mathbf{C}_{0} is sometimes referred to as a canonical form. So far all points in the 3D world have been represented in a camera centered coordinate system, that is, a coordinate system which has its origin at the camera center (the location of the pinhole of a pinhole camera). In practice however, the 3D points may be represented in terms of coordinates relative to an arbitrary coordinate system (X1', X2', X3'). Assuming that the camera coordinate axes (X1, X2, X3) and the axes (X1', X2', X3') are of Euclidean type (orthogonal and isotropic), there is a unique Euclidean 3D transformation (rotation and translation) between the two coordinate systems. In other words, the camera is not necessarily at the origin looking along the z axis. The two operations of rotation and translation of 3D coordinates can be represented as the two 4 \\\\times 4 matrices : \\\\left ( \\\\begin{array}{cc} \\\\mathbf{R} & \\\\mathbf{0} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hline \\\\mathbf{0} & 1 \\\\end{array} \\\\right ) and \\\\left ( \\\\begin{array}{cc} \\\\mathbf{I} & \\\\mathbf{t} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hline \\\\mathbf{0} & 1 \\\\end{array} \\\\right ) where \\\\mathbf{R} is a 3 \\\\times 3 rotation matrix and \\\\mathbf{t} is a 3-dimensional translation vector. When the first matrix is multiplied onto the homogeneous representation of a 3D point, the result is the homogeneous representation of the rotated point, and the second matrix performs instead a translation. Performing the two operations in sequence, i.e. first the rotation and then the translation (with translation vector given in the already rotated coordinate system), gives a combined rotation and translation matrix : \\\\left ( \\\\begin{array}{cc} \\\\mathbf{R} & \\\\mathbf{t} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hline \\\\mathbf{0} & 1 \\\\end{array} \\\\right ) Assuming that \\\\mathbf{R} and \\\\mathbf{t} are precisely the rotation and translations which relate the two coordinate system (X1,X2,X3) and (X1',X2',X3') above, this implies that : \\\\mathbf{x} = \\\\left ( \\\\begin{array}{cc} \\\\mathbf{R} & \\\\mathbf{t} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hline \\\\mathbf{0} & 1 \\\\end{array} \\\\right ) \\\\mathbf{x}' where \\\\mathbf{x}' is the homogeneous representation of the point P in the coordinate system (X1',X2',X3'). Assuming also that the camera matrix is given by \\\\mathbf{C}_{0} , the mapping from the coordinates in the (X1,X2,X3) system to homogeneous image coordinates becomes : \\\\mathbf{y} \\\\sim \\\\mathbf{C}_{0} \\\\, \\\\mathbf{x} = \\\\left ( \\\\begin{array}{cc} \\\\mathbf{I} & \\\\mathbf{0} \\\\end{array} \\\\right ) \\\\, \\\\left ( \\\\begin{array}{cc} \\\\mathbf{R} & \\\\mathbf{t} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hline \\\\mathbf{0} & 1 \\\\end{array} \\\\right ) \\\\mathbf{x}' = \\\\left ( \\\\begin{array}{cc} \\\\mathbf{R} & \\\\mathbf{t} \\\\end{array} \\\\right ) \\\\, \\\\mathbf{x}' Consequently, the camera matrix which relates points in the coordinate system (X1',X2',X3') to image coordinates is : \\\\mathbf{C}_{N} = \\\\left ( \\\\begin{array}{cc} \\\\mathbf{R} & \\\\mathbf{t} \\\\end{array} \\\\right ) a concatenation of a 3D rotation matrix and a 3-dimensional translation vector. This type of camera matrix is referred to as a normalized camera matrix, it assumes focal length = 1 and that image coordinates are measured in a coordinate system where the origin is located at the intersection between axis X3 and the image plane and has the same units as the 3D coordinate system. The resulting image coordinates are referred to as normalized image coordinates.  The camera position  Again, the null space of the normalized camera matrix, \\\\mathbf{C}_{N} described above, is spanned by the 4-dimensional vector : \\\\mathbf{n} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} -\\\\mathbf{R}^{-1} \\\\, \\\\mathbf{t} \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\tilde{\\\\mathbf{n}} \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 \\\\end{pmatrix} This is also, again, the coordinates of the camera center, now relative to the (X1',X2',X3') system. This can be seen by applying first the rotation and then the translation to the 3-dimensional vector \\\\tilde{\\\\mathbf{n}} and the result is the homogeneous representation of 3D coordinates (0,0,0). This implies that the camera center (in its homogeneous representation) lies in the null space of the camera matrix, provided that it is represented in terms of 3D coordinates relative to the same coordinate system as the camera matrix refers to. The normalized camera matrix \\\\mathbf{C}_{N} can now be written as : \\\\mathbf{C}_{N} = \\\\mathbf{R} \\\\, \\\\left ( \\\\begin{array}{cc} \\\\mathbf{I} & \\\\mathbf{R}^{-1} \\\\, \\\\mathbf{t} \\\\end{array} \\\\right ) = \\\\mathbf{R} \\\\, \\\\left ( \\\\begin{array}{cc} \\\\mathbf{I} & -\\\\tilde{\\\\mathbf{n}} \\\\end{array} \\\\right ) where \\\\tilde{\\\\mathbf{n}} is the 3D coordinates of the camera relative to the (X1',X2',X3') system. == General camera matrix == Given the mapping produced by a normalized camera matrix, the resulting normalized image coordinates can be transformed by means of an arbitrary 2D homography. This includes 2D translations and rotations as well as scaling (isotropic and anisotropic) but also general 2D perspective transformations. Such a transformation can be represented as a 3 \\\\times 3 matrix \\\\mathbf{H} which maps the homogeneous normalized image coordinates \\\\mathbf{y} to the homogeneous transformed image coordinates \\\\mathbf{y}' : : \\\\mathbf{y}' = \\\\mathbf{H} \\\\, \\\\mathbf{y} Inserting the above expression for the normalized image coordinates in terms of the 3D coordinates gives : \\\\mathbf{y}' = \\\\mathbf{H} \\\\, \\\\mathbf{C}_{N} \\\\, \\\\mathbf{x}' This produces the most general form of camera matrix : \\\\mathbf{C} = \\\\mathbf{H} \\\\, \\\\mathbf{C}_{N} = \\\\mathbf{H} \\\\, \\\\left ( \\\\begin{array}{cc} \\\\mathbf{R} & \\\\mathbf{t} \\\\end{array} \\\\right ) == See also == *3D projection == References == * Category:Geometry in computer vision ","title":"Camera matrix"},{"id":"12365960","text":"In molecular biology, heat shock factors (HSF), are the transcription factors that regulate the expression of the heat shock proteins. A typical example is the heat shock factor of Drosophila melanogaster. == Function == Heat shock factors (HSF) are transcriptional activators of heat shock genes. These activators bind specifically to Heat Shock sequence Elements (HSE) throughout the genome whose consensus-sequence is a tandem array of three oppositely oriented \\"AGAAN\\" motifs or a degenerate version thereof. Under non-stressed conditions, Drosophila HSF is a nuclear-localized unbound monomer, whereas heat shock activation results in trimerization and binding to the HSE. The Heat Shock sequence Element is highly conserved from yeast to humans. Heat shock factor 1 (HSF-1) is the major regulator of heat shock protein transcription in eukaryotes. In the absence of cellular stress, HSF-1 is inhibited by association with heat shock proteins and is therefore not active. Cellular stresses, such as increased temperature, can cause proteins in the cell to misfold. Heat shock proteins bind to the misfolded proteins and associate from HSF-1. This allows HSF1 to form trimers and translocate to the cell nucleus and activate transcription. Its function is not only critical to overcome the proteotoxic effects of thermal stress, but also needed for proper animal development and the overall survival of cancer cells. == Structure == Each HSF monomer contains one C-terminal and three N-terminal leucine zipper repeats. Point mutations in these regions result in disruption of cellular localisation, rendering the protein constitutively nuclear in humans. Two sequences flanking the N-terminal zippers fit the consensus of a bi-partite nuclear localization signal (NLS). Interaction between the N- and C-terminal zippers may result in a structure that masks the NLS sequences: following activation of HSF, these may then be unmasked, resulting in relocalisation of the protein to the nucleus. The DNA-binding component of HSF lies to the N-terminus of the first NLS region, and is referred to as the HSF domain. == Isoforms == Humans express the following heat shock factors: {  - ! gene ! protein -  HSF1  heat shock transcription factor 1 -  HSF2  heat shock transcription factor 2 -   heat shock transcription factor 2 binding protein -  HSF4  heat shock transcription factor 4 -   heat shock transcription factor family member 5 -   heat shock transcription factor family, X linked 1 -   heat shock transcription factor family, X linked 2 -   heat shock transcription factor, Y-linked 1 -   heat shock transcription factor, Y-linked 2 } ==References== Category:Transcription factors ","title":"Heat shock factor"},{"id":"12365968","text":"Rebecca Cohn (born March 30, 1954 in Vallejo, California) is an American politician who served as the California State Assembly member for the 24th District from 2001 to 2007.

Claws will continue to grow following tendonectomy, and because the cat can no longer extend the claws to scratch, the cat will not wear down the claws as before. Therefore, among other considerations, the cat owner should evaluate the ongoing maintenance required in the form of regular claw trimming thereafter when considering this procedure. In terms of studies on the impact of onychectomy versus tendonectomy, the American Veterinary Medical Association compared the outcomes of the two operations in its August 1, 1998 issue. Their report considered owner satisfaction and drawbacks such as pain and future complications. Cats who underwent tendonectomy displayed significantly lower pain immediately following the procedure versus those who underwent onychectomy. However, both procedures showed an equal frequency of other complications, such as bleeding, lameness, and infection. Cats took the same number of days to recover from both operations (as measured by normalcy in walking), and owners were equally satisfied with both options. One complication to watch out for later on in the cat's life with a tendonectomy is the nails getting brittle. Nails that are more brittle are prone to splitting and shattering when trimmed by the owner, which is quite painful for the cat. == External links == *Journal for the American Veterinary Medical Association *Tendonectomy: A Surgical Alternative To Declawing Cats *CatHelp- Online * Grier, K. and Peterson, N. \\"Indoor Cats, Scratching, and the Debate over Declawing: When Normal Pet Behavior Becomes a Problem.\\" Humane Society Press, 2005. http://www.hsus.org/web_file/PDF/hsp/SOA_3-2005_Chap3.pdf Category:Cruelty to animals ","title":"Tendonectomy"},{"id":"12365986","text":"WABF (1480 AM, \\"The Original One of a Kind\\") is an American radio station licensed to serve the community of Mobile, Alabama. The station, established in 1948, is owned by Donald Pugh, through licensee Eternity Record Company LLC. WABF broadcasts from midtown Mobile's Springhill Avenue, its home since 1969, after leaving its former Government Street studio in downtown Mobile. ==History== The station began broadcasting at 1480 kHz on June 19, 1948, when it was owned by the Mobile Register as WABB (\\"Alabama's Best Broadcasters\\") and had a country music format. Shortly after owner Bernie Dittman moved to Mobile from his native Ohio to join his father J.W. at the station, Top-40 music became the new format. WABB had an FM simulcast from the very beginning, starting with 107.9 MHz and later 102.1 MHz until it was discontinued in the 1950s. The most recent incarnation of WABB-FM (97.5 FM) signed on for the first time on February 5, 1973, with the song \\"Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again\\" by Bob Dylan. WABB-FM was originally a simulcast of its sister station before moving toward the format of album oriented rock. When WABB-FM made the move to the contemporary hit radio format in 1984, the AM station continued to play Top-40 music. Eventually, the economics of AM radio in the United States meant a move away from music and the station adopted a talk radio format. Station's last logo as WABB WABB's longtime owner, president, and general manager Bernie Dittman died on October 25, 2006, after suffering from a stroke the previous week. Dittman's daughter Betsey succeeded him after relocating to Mobile from Chicago, Illinois. In its final years as WABB, the station broadcast a talk radio format featuring a line-up of primarily nationally syndicated conservative talk programming along with some locally produced programs. Some of the personalities on the station included national hosts such as Laura Ingraham, Michael Smerconish, Lou Dobbs, and Jerry Doyle. WALA-TV's morning newscast was simulcast weekdays from 5:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m. WABB was the radio home of Mobile's minor league baseball team the Mobile BayBears from the 2001 through the 2006 seasons. On February 17, 2012, the Dittman family announced on its website that it has decided to sell WABB-FM to Educational Media Foundation (EMF) for an undisclosed price. That station flipped to the K-LOVE Christian Contemporary format on March 1, 2012,\\"WABB-FM Agrees to be Purchased by Educational Media Foundation\\" from WABB (February 17, 2012) and soon after adopted the callsign WLVM, which EMF transferred from WKIW, the K-LOVE station in Ironwood, Michigan. The EMF sale excluded WABB AM, which the Dittman family had chosen to retain for the time being, therefore retaining the rights to the WABB callsign. The Dittman family closed the sale of the station to Omni Broadcasting on October 24, 2012, and the new owners changed the call sign to WTKD, following the flip to sports talk. Big Fish Broadcasting reserved the \\"WABB\\" call letters for their silent AM radio station in Belton, South Carolina. The station was sold to Donald Pugh's Eternity Record Company LLC at a purchase price of $175,000; the transaction was consummated on July 15, 2014. On August 19, 2014, the station changed its call sign to WERM. The station's gospel format gave way to the standards and swap shop programming from sister station WABF in early February 2017. WABF lost its transmitter site and ran into issues finding a new site, leading to that format migrating here. It's reported to be a permanent solution. WERM's gospel migrated to the 1220 facility, which, as of mid- February 2017, was being temporarily diplexed onto the 1480 tower site. On December 6, 2017, the stations swapped call signs, with WERM assuming its current WABF calls. During its long history, WABB AM/FM was home to many air personalities and news anchors who moved up to major markets and radio networks, including Scott Shannon, Leslie Fram, Norman Robinson, and Raymond Bannister. ==ReferencesExternal links== *FCC History Cards for WABF ABF (AM) Category:Radio stations established in 1948 Category:1948 establishments in Alabama ","title":"WABF (AM)"},{"id":"12365994","text":"Giovanni Marradi (born 1952) is a composer, pianist, arranger and television presenter. He is the son of Italian trumpeter and conductor Alfredo Marradi; his great-grandfather, also named Giovanni Marradi, was a poet and composer. Giovanni began playing piano at age five, and three years later was sent to study composition and technique with Michael Cheskinov at the Russian Conservatory. As a young adult, he played throughout Europe and the Middle East, but his dream was to come to the U.S. to pursue his music career. After arriving in California as an Italian immigrant, Giovanni played small concerts in Southern California and was asked to perform at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas. Giovanni became one of the most successful expressionist pianists of our time, as well as a composer, arranger, recording artist, inventor and illustrator. Among his accomplishments, he sold 120,000 CDs in one two-hour segment on the QVC shopping channel. Another record that still stands as one of his outstanding achievements in the music industry is selling over four million CDs during his appearances on QVC and the Home Shopping Network. Giovanni produced, directed and hosted Giovanni's World of Music, a 28-episode television music series broadcast on stations around the world and distributed by Warner Brothers Television. Both the series and Giovanni himself have been nominated for and received several awards from the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, the Telly Awards, EMA and the New York Festivals. His concert specials on PBS are still being aired. Giovanni has recorded over 130 CDs and two DVDs from his televised specials. In 1995, he formed his own label, NewCastle Records. He released over 60 titles with NewCastle before signing with Atlantic Records in 1998, making his label debut, Destiny. Giovanni's album Because I Love You won Best New Age CD of the year in Spain for 2010. In November 2015, he performed a sold-out concert in Beijing, China at the Great Hall of the People to rave reviews. Giovanni's concert at the Great Hall drew much attention and he recently returned to China for a twenty city concert tour while giving Master Classes for the children in every city on the tour during Feb/March of 2019. ==Discography (partial)== * 1992 - Boleros * 1992 - Boleros - Vol.II * 1992 - Broadway Themes * 1992 - Promises * 1993 - Secrets * 1993 - Giovanni Plays The Beatles Love Songs (2 CDs) * 1993 - Piano Masterpieces * 1993 - What If * 1995 - Come Back To Me * 1995 - Serenity * 1995 - Together * 1996 - Passion * 1997 - Always * 1997 - Christmas With Giovanni (Vol.1) * 1997 - Feelings * 1997 - Homenaje A Julio Iglesias * 1997 - Music From The World * 1997 - Music From The World - Vol.II * 1998 - Always & Forever * 1998 - Falling In Love * 1998 - Destiny * 1999 - Classic Nights * 1999 - Eternally * 1999 - Gracefully * 1999 - Latin Lovers * 1999 - Lover's Rendezvous (3 CDs) * 1999 - Romantically Yours * 1999 - The Best of Giovanni (2 CDs) * 2000 - Around The World Vol.1 * 2000 - Around The World - Vol.2 * 2000 - Around The World Vol.3 * 2000 - Broadway Romance * 2000 - My Valentine (2 CDs) * 2001 - Remember When * 2002 - Alone * 2002 - Cinema Romance * 2002 - Classical Moods * 2002 - Colors Of Music * 2002 - Destiny * 2002 - Dreams * 2002 - Dreams Nature & Music * 2002 - Forever * 2002 - Mystique * 2002 - Moonlight Sonata * 2002 - Mountain Breeze * 2002 - Nocturnes * 2002 - Romantique * 2002 - The Way We Were * 2002 - Treasures Of Time * 2003 - Live From Las Vegas * 2004 - Favorite Love Songs - Vol.1 * 2004 - Favorite Love Songs - Vol.2 * 2004 - Favorite Love Songs - Vol.3 * 2004 - For You * 2004 - Return To Me * 2005 - French Classics * 2005 - Love Letters * 2005 - Passionate Piano * 2005 - Winter Moods * 2006 - Italian Love Songs * 2007 - Latin Moods * 2007 - Television Classics * 2008 - Romantico * 2008 - The Best of Giovanni (3 CDs) * 2010 - Because I Love You * 2010 - Christmas Classics - Vol.1 * 2010 - Christmas Classics - Vol.2 * 2010 - Christmas Classics - Vol.3 * 2010 - Gift of Love * 2010 - Gift of Christmas - Vol.1 * 2010 - Gift of Christmas - Vol.2 * 2010 - Gift of Christmas - Vol.3 * 2010 - Have a Romantic Christmas * 2010 - Have a Romantic Christmas - Vol.2 * 2010 - Joy of Christmas 1 * 2010 - Joy of Christmas 2 * 2010 - Joy of Christmas 3 * 2010 - Merry Christmas 1 * 2010 - Merry Christmas 2 * 2010 - Merry Christmas 3 * 2010 - Romantico * 2010 - Softly * 2011 - The Giovanni Holiday Collection - A Merry, Merry Christmas To You! * 2012 - Solo Piano - Broadway Themes II * 2012 - Sospiro * 2012 - Because I Love You ==DVDs== * 2004 - Giovanni Live From Las Vegas * 2006 - Timeless ==ReferencesExternal links== * [ Giovanni Marradi at Allmusic] * Official site (giovanni.com) Category:Italian emigrants to the United States Category:American television personalities Category:New-age pianists Category:Living people Category:1952 births Category:21st-century pianists ","title":"Giovanni Marradi (musician)"},{"id":"12365997","text":"Ross Daniels may refer to: * Ross Daniels (actor), Australian actor * Ross Daniels (activist), Australian human rights campaigner ","title":"Ross Daniels"},{"id":"12366029","text":"Charles Brand may refer to: *Charles Brand (general) (1873‚Äì1961), Australian Army brigadier-general in World War I *Charles Hillyer Brand (1861‚Äì1933), American politician, businessman, jurist and lawyer *Charles Brand (congressman) (1871‚Äì1966), U.S. Representative from Ohio *Charles Brand of Dundee, a firm of housebreakers *Charles Amarin Brand (1920‚Äì2013), French prelate of the Roman Catholic Church *Charles John Brand (1879‚Äì1949), United States Department of Agriculture official *Charles Brand (water polo) (1916‚Äì1984), British Olympic water polo player ","title":"Charles Brand"},{"id":"12366040","text":"Get Lost is the 68th animated cartoon short subject in the Woody Woodpecker series. Released theatrically on March 12, 1956, the film was produced by Walter Lantz Productions and distributed by Universal-International. The cartoon is based on the well-known fairy tale for Hansel and Gretel of German origin, recorded by the Brothers Grimm. ==Plot== Woody is reading the story of Hansel and Gretel to his nephew Knothead and his niece Splinter. Neither of the kids seem to be interested, though, and walk out while Woody is still reading. However, the kids decide to act out the story by pretending to be Hansel and Gretel and purposely getting lost in the woods. A cat spots the two little woodpeckers and decides to catch and cook them. In order to capture Knothead and Splinter, the cat makes a gingerbread house (from a Ready‚ÄìMix Gingerbread House mix) and, through a straw, shoots Mexican Jumping Jelly Beans at the kids. The little woodpeckers eat the jelly beans, which send them jumping to the gingerbread house. As Knothead and Splinter arrive, they are greeted by the cat whom they know is up to no good, but they go along with him anyway. The cat decides to eat Splinter for lunch and save Knothead for dinner, but Knothead escapes. Meanwhile, Splinter reads the cat a recipe for Woodpecker Pot Pie, and prepares herself to go into the oven along with the pie, while Knothead decides to play a few tricks on the cat. When the cat finally catches the two woodpeckers, he puts them in the oven but Knothead takes the phone with him and calls the gas company to tell them he refuses to pay the bill. As a result, the woodpeckers emerge from the oven alive, but before they can escape the cat catches Knothead by putting salt on his tail. Splinter puts the cat's tail in an egg beater in order to save Knothead and give him a chance to escape. Once he is free, Knothead takes the cat's tail and paints a facsimile of himself on it. The cat ends up putting his own tail into the oven and burns himself. For the finish, the little woodpeckers give the cat a bowl of soup with a firecracker in it, and make their escape back home. ==Notes== Though part of the Woody Woodpecker series, its main stars are Woody's nephew and niece Knothead and Splinter, who make their first appearances in this short. The two were well received by audiences, leading to another appearance the following year in Red Riding Hoodlum. ==References== *Cooke, Jon, Komorowski, Thad, Shakarian, Pietro, and Tatay, Jack. \\"1956\\".

Depending on the corn plant‚Äôs growth stage, the virus can have severe implications to the corn plant‚Äôs development which can also result in economic consequences to the producer of the crop. == Importance == Maize (Zea mays) is a major cereal crop; it is third behind rice and wheat in production. An average of 380 million tons are produced annually by 53 countries. Maize is the most widely grown crop ranging from tropical areas with altitudes over 3000 m to temperate areas extending as far north as the 65th latitude. MDMV is the most serious virus of sweet corn. If corn plants are infected with MDMV, ear formation and development are slowed leading to grain yield loss. The damage from MDMV can cause the halting of ear formation and development, ultimately leading to the production of barren ears and direct yield loss. There can be losses of up to 42% on early planted field corn. If corn is planted late MDMV can cause 75% or more loss on inbred and hybrid varieties. The number of ears per plant is reduced by MDMV infection and the fresh weight of these ears can be reduced by 30%. == Pathogenesis == MDMV is caused by various strains. There are 5 strains A, C, D, E, and F. They differ in biological, serological, and nucleotide sequences. The vector for MDMV transmission is aphids. There are 15 aphid species that can non-persistently transmit MDMV. The aphids mainly feed on the family Poaceae. MDMV overwinters in alternate hosts. These hosts range is sorghum, maize, and Johnson grass. Symptoms appear six weeks after aphids feed and transmit the virus. The aphid acquires the virus within seconds of feeding on an infected plant, either maize, Johnson grass, or sorghum. There is no latent period for transmission to new host plants. After acquiring MDMV an aphid is able to transmit the virus within 15‚Äì30 minutes. Aphids do not retain MDMV after molting. The virus can also be spread through the seed or mechanically by leaf rubbing of Johnson grass and sorghum. MDMV in the field is not typically transmitted by seed or mechanically, it is more prevalent in greenhouses. Depending on the hybrid, most maize plants will show higher rates of disease when infected earlier in the growing stage. The pathogen itself is a flexuous, rod-shaped virus measuring 12 x 750 nm. There are antiserum kits that can confirm the viruses identity. There is resistance to MDMV. Maize plants can have up to 5 resistance genes in their genetic make up. There are commercially available hybrids that provide good resistance. The major gene for resistance is called mdm1 and it is found on chromosome 6. Mdm1 was identified in Pa405, an inbred line. This chromosomal region of mdm1 is also where resistance genes to two other phtyviridae viruses are located. The resistance conferred by mdm1 can be greatly altered with genetic, environmental, and developmental factors. Breeding trials for MDMV resistance at University of Wisconsin West Madison Agricultural Research Station At the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison there are breeding trials to help create new varieties that are resistant to MDMV. == Environment == MDMV prefers warm to average temperatures. Johnson grass infected with MDMV in the surrounding environment can increase the disease on maize. MDMV is a cultivated virus that mainly occurs in the United States and Australia. MDMV does not overwinter in Minnesota and Wisconsin, which makes the source of inoculum in these northern states unclear. During infection after periods of cool night temperatures, about 60 ¬∞F, the plants may exhibit signs of the disease such as blotches or streaks of red. ==Transmission== Maize Dwarf Mosaic Virus is spread by seed, by infected leaves rubbing on non- infected leaves and perhaps most commonly, via aphids (Lipps & Mills, n.d.). These aphids become carriers after they feed on plants such as Johnson grass, corn or sorghum, or other grass species that are infected with MDMV. Broadleaf plants do not become infected with MDMV (The CIMMYT Maize Program). Aphids transmit Maize Dwarf Mosaic Virus disease effectively fifteen to thirty minutes after feeding on infected plants when by spreading the virus to the susceptible plants after they have flown or are blown onto a nearby corn crop and will start to feed (‚ÄúMaize Dwarf Mosaic Virus,‚Äù n.d.). ==Symptoms== When looking for symptoms of MDMV in corn, one must also be aware of the plant‚Äôs growth stage as symptoms may affect the plant differently at various stages. Young leaves, may experience chlorotic spotting which may eventually turn into a mosaic or mottle pattern (‚ÄúMaize Dwarf Mosaic Virus,‚Äù n.d.). Later in the growing season, the mosaic pattern may bleed into a general yellowing of the leaf and eventually areas of red streaks or blotches may appear if night time temperatures are consistently around 60 degrees Fahrenheit (Lipps & Mills, n.d.). Plants affected later in their reproductive cycle may experience a slowing in ear development (‚ÄúMaize Dwarf Mosaic Virus,‚Äù n.d.), while some plants may even become barren (Lipps & Mills, n.d.). It is not uncommon for plants to have shortened upper internodes or an increase in tiller number (‚ÄúMaize Dwarf Mosaic Virus,‚Äù n.d.). ==Control== Maize Dwarf Mosaic Virus can be managed in several ways. One way is the removal of the local population of Johnson grass as this can harbor the disease. It is best if all producers (farmers) in the area participate in this practice or the disease can remain in sporadic plant populations and be spread in the ways described above (Lipps & Mills, n.d.). Another way to help avoid MDMV is by selecting corn varieties that are tolerant of the virus and by planting corn crops earlier in the season to help seedlings avoid key aphid population times (Lipps & Mills, n.d.). ==References== *The CIMMYT Maize Program. 2004.

The console features a port on the top when vertical (left side when horizontal) to which a custom-housed hard disk drive unit can be attached in sizes of either 20, 60, 120, 250, 320, 500 GB1 GB = one billion bytes (109 B); and as of April 2015 all 2.5\\" SATA Hard Drives up to 2 TB1 TB = one thousand billion bytes (1012 B), the user can use the format option from system settings to utilize the new HDD. Inside, the Xbox 360 uses the triple-core IBM designed Xenon as its CPU, with each core capable of simultaneously processing two threads, and can therefore operate on up to six threads at once. Graphics processing is handled by the ATI Xenos, which has 10 MB of eDRAM. Its main memory pool is 512 MB1 MB = 10242 B in size. == Central processing unit == The Xbox 360 took a different approach to hardware compared to its predecessor. The XCPU, named Xenon at Microsoft and \\"Waternoose\\" at IBM, is a custom triple-core 64-bit PowerPC-based design by IBM. The CPU emphasized high floating point performance through multiple FPU and SIMD vector processors in each core. The SIMD vector processor (VMX128) was modified for the Xbox to include a dot-product instruction. The dot- product instruction took far less latency than discrete instructions. The VMX128 was also modified by the addition of direct 3D (D3D) compressed data format. This led to an approximate 50 percent savings in required band-width and memory footprint making the CPU having a theoretical peak performance of 115.2 GFLOPS, being capable of 9.6 billion dot products per second. Each core of the CPU was capable of simultaneous multithreading and was clocked at 3.2 GHz. However, to reduce CPU die size, complexity, cost, and power demands, the processor used in-order execution in contrast to the Intel Coppermine 128-based Pentium III used in the original Xbox, which used more complex out- of-order execution. The original chip used a 90 nm process, although a newer 65 nm process SOI revision was implemented on later models, which was in-turn superseded by a 45 nm combined CPU and GPU chip. A 21.6 GB/s front side bus, aggregated 10.8 GB/s upstream and downstream, connected Xenon with the graphics processor/northbridge. Xenon was equipped with an 8th way set associative 1 MB Level 2 cache on-die running at half CPU clock speed. This cache was shared amongst the three CPU cores. Each core had separate L1 caches, each containing a two-way set associative 32-Kbyte L1 instruction cache and a four-way set associative 32-Kbyte L1 data cache. The write-through data cache did not allocate cache lines on writes. The CPU also contained ROM storing Microsoft private encrypted keys, used to decrypt game data. The heat sink implemented to cool the Xenon CPU was composed of aluminum fins with a copper base, and a heat pipe. Newer revisions, which had a smaller core, do not feature the heat pipe or copper base. The heat sink was cooled by two 70 mm fans at the rear of the console on original-style consoles, while a single fan mounted on the side of the consoles was used in Xbox 360 S consoles. There were several types of fan used in Xbox 360s, which were produced by Nidec, Sunon and Delta Electronics. == CPU data streaming == During read streaming into the CPU, a custom prefetch instruction, extended data cache block touch (xDCBT) prefetches data directly to the L1 data cache of the intended core, which skips putting the data in the L2 cache to avoid thrashing the L2 cache. Writes streaming from each core skip the L1 cache, due to its no-write allocation (avoids thrashing of high-bandwidth, transient, write-only data streams on the L1 cache), and goes directly to the L2 cache. The system allows for the GPU to directly read data produced by the CPU without going to main memory. In this specific case of data streaming, called Xbox procedural synthesis (XPS), the CPU is effectively a data decompressor, generating geometry on-the-fly for consumption by the GPU 3D core. == Graphics processing unit == While the first Xbox's graphics processing unit was produced by Nvidia, the Xbox 360 had a chip designed by ATI called Xenos. The chip was developed under the name \\"C1\\" and \\"R500\\" was often used to refer to it. The GPU package contains two separate silicon dies, each built on a 90 nm process with a clock speed of 500 MHz; the GPU proper, manufactured by TSMC and a 10 MB eDRAM daughter-die, manufactured by NEC. Thanks to the daughter die, the Xenos can do 4√ó MSAA, z-buffering, and alpha blending with no appreciable performance penalty on the GPU. The GPU also houses additional capabilities typically separated into a motherboard chipset in PC systems, effectively replacing the northbridge chip. It has a theoretical peak of 240 GFLOPS. Due to the GPU frequently overheating in early motherboard models, Microsoft revised the GPU heat sink in order to eliminate thermal throttling. == Memory and system bandwidth == Xbox 360 bandwidth and hardware scheme. The console features 512 MB of GDDR3 RAM clocked at 700 MHz with an effective transmission rate of 1.4 GHz on a 128-bit bus. The memory is shared by the CPU and the GPU via the unified memory architecture. This memory is produced by either Samsung or Qimonda. According to Mark Rein of Epic Games, Microsoft had originally planned on using only 256 MB of RAM, but the decision to increase it was based on Epic's upcoming Gears of War title. Epic had been arguing for Microsoft to increase the memory for some time, and Tim Sweeney had sent Microsoft screenshots of what Gears would look like at 256 MB, and then at their proposed 512 MB. Shortly thereafter, Epic was the first studio told of new 512 MB size specification and claimed it cost them a billion dollars but felt it was better for gamers. The Xbox 360 has an extensive amount of bandwidth in comparison to its competition; however, this statistic includes the eDRAM logic to memory bandwidth, and not internal CPU bandwidths. The eDRAM internal logic to its internal memory bandwidth is 256 GB/s. The high bandwidth is used primarily for z-buffering, alpha blending, and antialiasing; it saves time and space on the GPU die. Between the eDRAM die and the GPU, data is transferred at 32 GB/s. The memory interface bus has a bandwidth of 22.40 GB/s and the Southbridge a bandwidth of 0.5 GB/s. == Audio and video == All games made for the Xbox 360 are required to support at least Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound. The console works with over 256 audio channels and 320 independent decompression channels using 32-bit processing for audio, with support for 48 kHz 16-bit sound. Sound files for games are encoded using Microsoft's XMA audio format. An MPEG-2 decoder is included for DVD video playback. VC-1 or WMV is used for streaming video and other video is compressed using VC-1 at non-HD NTSC and PAL resolutions or WMV HD. The Xbox 360 also supports H.263 and H.264 MPEG-4 videos. Unlike the original Xbox, voice communication is handled by the console, not by the game code, allowing for cross-game communication. There is no voice echo to game players on the same console; voice only goes to remote consoles. Initially there were no digital video outputs such as DVI or HDMI on the Xbox 360; instead, HD-quality output could only be produced over component video (used by both the 3 RCA component cable and the Japanese D-terminal cable) and later VGA (via a software update). An HDMI port was introduced to the Xbox 360 by July 2007 with the introduction of the Elite model. All Xbox 360 SKUs currently manufactured feature an HDMI port. A wide array of SDTV and HDTV resolutions are supported by the console hardware; up to 1080p after the October 2006 software upgrade. While most games are rendered natively at 720p, the video from all games can be scaled by the hardware to whatever resolution the user has set in the console's settings; from 480i NTSC and 576i PAL all the way to 1080p HDTV. == DVD storage == Early production runs of the Xbox 360 are equipped with a 12x DVD drive, capable of a maximum read rate of 0.01585 GB/s. The original production DVD drives were manufactured by both LG and Toshiba. Beginning in November 2006, a new model the BenQ VAD6038 was introduced, which is said to run faster than the previous models and, in addition, is much quieter. There is a new drive by LiteOn. Games are stored on standard dual-layer DVD-ROMs with 6.8 GB on the older XGD2 (Xbox Game Disc 2), but the newer XGD3 discs contain 7.8 GB of usable space available for game content. The option to apply a regional lockout to games is available to publishers, although DVD region codes are always enforced for movies. Microsoft has implemented methods to prevent hacking through the drive. Later drive models have the external debug triggering removed and black hard glue added to cover all the chip and controller pins. The drive is able to read both DVD¬±R and DVD¬±RW in addition to being able to play DVD-Video out of the box, unlike its predecessor, which required the purchase of an add-on remote. The system is also capable of playing standard CDs along with CD-R/RW, CD-DA, CD-ROM XA, CD-Extra, WMA-CD, MP3-CD, and JPEG Photo CD. Some users reported problems with the disc drive, as when a user changes the console's orientation, the inserted disc may brush against the drive's pickup assembly and incur scratches to it. The users manual advises against changing the console's position while there is a disc in the drive. Other users report experiencing disc scratching during normal horizontal usage. Announced at CES 2006 and first publicly shown at E3 2006, an external HD DVD drive was released in North America on November 7, 2006 (for US$199.99) and in Japan on November 17, 2006 (for ¬•19,800). In the UK, France and Germany, the HD DVD drive was released for ‚Ç¨199.99/¬£129.99. The HD DVD drive was bundled for a limited time with an Xbox 360 Universal Media Remote, as well as an HD DVD copy of Peter Jackson's King Kong. The drive plays HD DVD movies, although all Xbox 360 games will remain on the DVD format. Microsoft had no plans to include an internal HD DVD player in future Xbox 360 designs. The drive connects to the Xbox 360 via USB and contains two integrated USB ports on the rear. Games can not be played on the HD DVD drive. Microsoft has since discontinued the HD DVD add-on since the format was officially dropped by Toshiba.

These units have a custom connector to facilitate connection to the Xbox 360 and the drives themselves feature custom firmware (making stand- alone drives incompatible). The drives are detachable, making it possible to move data from one console to another, and to upgrade the size of drive on a console. The hard drives themselves are manufactured by various companies, including Fujitsu, Seagate, Samsung, Hitachi and Western Digital. Certain Western Digital hard disk drives can be modified with a program called HDDHackr to be used with the Xbox 360. The original Pro configuration of the system came with a 20 GB hard drive, which was also available to purchase separately (for the Core model, and later the Arcade model, which did not include a HDD). This was upgraded to 60 GB in September 2008, and the 60 GB HDD was also made available at retail. In April 2007, Microsoft released the Elite console, which included a black 120 GB HDD; a grey 120 GB drive was also later made available at retail. In November 2009, Microsoft released the \\"Super Elite\\" console, as a bundle with the highly anticipated game Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. This console was like the typical black Elite, but with Call of Duty graphics added and for the first time included a 250 GB hard drive (which holds up to 228 GB of data after system information is stored). This was followed by various other 250 GB special/limited edition bundles. No standard (non-special edition) configuration of the original console ever included a 250 GB drive, but they were later made available at retail. In June 2010, Microsoft announced a new version of the console, the Xbox 360 S, which used a new form factor for its 250 GB hard drives. As such, original style hard drives cannot be used in Xbox 360 S consoles, and vice versa, without modification. In June 2011, Microsoft announced a specially branded Gears of War 3 Limited Collector's Edition Xbox 360 S console to coincide with the launch of Gears of War 3. At 320 GB, the included hard drive is the largest available for/with the original Xbox 360 model. In August 2014, Microsoft announced and released a new 500 GB hard drive for the Xbox 360 S console model, currently the largest hard drive available for or with any Xbox 360 model. Approximately 7 GB of a 60 GB drive is reserved for system use (4 GB of that portion is reserved for game title caching and other hard drive specific elements in games that support the hard drive, and an additional 2 GB is reserved for use by the Xbox 360 backwards-compatibility software). This leaves just under 54 GB of free space, rounded down to 53 GB in the dashboard, for saving game files, Xbox Live Arcade downloadable content, and media files (such as music and video). Similar figures apply to other hard disk drive sizes. Other independent companies have manufactured 250 GB hard drives using hacked firmware since 2008. Many of these allegedly infringe trademarks of Microsoft, including the Microsoft logo, Xbox 360 logo, and the likeness of the removable hard disk drive design. == Networking == All versions of the Xbox 360 come with a built-in 10/100Mbit/s wired Ethernet network adapter. The Xbox 360 Wireless Adapter (identifiable as gray with one antenna) connects via a USB port and adds support for 802.11a and 802.11b/g Wi-Fi. This was replaced by the Wireless N Adapter (black with two antennas), which added support for 802.11n on both the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands. The original Xbox 360 model features a pair of notches on the rear of the console, above the USB socket, to which the adapter can be attached. Alternatively, a pair of fold-out feet on the adapter can be used to stand it up separately. The Xbox 360 S and Xbox 360 E consoles feature built-in support for 802.11b/g/n but on the 2.4 GHz band only. The Wireless and Wireless N Adapters can be used on these models to add support for the 5 GHz band (albeit the former losing support for 802.11n over 2.4 GHz) and will, in some cases, offer \\"... better range and bandwidth compared with the internal wireless feature ...\\" If this adapter is connected, the internal wireless adapter is disabled. The S and E models lack the notches for the adapter. == Motherboards == Microsoft avoids outright announcements of new motherboard production runs and their subsequent appearance in the market in part due to uneven distribution causing buyer's remorse and to prevent purchaser delay.Microsoft Xbox 360 Internal Memorandum 11952006; Announcement of new motherboards may cause consumers to delay purchases of existing units and some regions with slower inventory turnover may not see the newer units for some time However, several major (and many minor) motherboard revisions are introduced in an attempt to build systems more cheaply (and thus increase profits), and as a happy side effect, to allow them to run cooler while consuming less power. Note that there is no clear divide between the appearance of motherboard revisions in retail. Due to individual stock production, distribution and rotation, it may become difficult to find specific versions. The power connectors on the back of these systems incorporate a \\"keying\\" system that will prevent plugging a (newer) lower-rated power supply into an older system (which needs more power). The keying system does, however, allow older power supplies to be connected to newer systems, as this poses no problem. The initial motherboard version was known as \\"Xenon\\" and used a 203 watt power supply, and lacked an HDMI video port. Later models had an improved GPU heatsink. The \\"Zephyr\\" revision was a redesigned motherboard adding the HANA and HDMI, but used the same 90 nm CPU as the Xenon. It did howerver, move to an 80 nm GPU and eDRAM, with an improved GPU heatsink. The \\"Falcon\\" incorporated a newer 65 nm CPU, and required less power so it came packaged with a 175 watt power supply. \\"Jasper\\" (released late November 2008) used both a 65 nm CPU and GPU, as well as 16, 256 or 512 MB of on-board flash memory. (This was to help run a then-recent Dashboard update. Without the addition of this internal memory, a hard disk drive or memory card is required.) The \\"Jasper\\" revision required even less power, and so the power supply was also reduced to 150 watts. The \\"Kronos\\" revision is a minor upgrade of the \\"Jasper\\", moving to a new \\"Kronos1\\" GPU with a 65 nm eDRAM, and adding a new Ring of Light/RF board called \\"XFreedom\\". Due to all dies now being at 65 nm, the GPU heatsink returned to the original one used on the \\"Xenon\\". Xbox 360 S introduced a new motherboard version called \\"Trinity\\" with a 45 nm integrated CPU, GPU, and eDRAM. It consisted of 2 dies, one for the XCGPU, and one for the eDRAM. In 2011 a second model of the Xbox 360 S motherboard has been released known as \\"Corona\\" which integrates the HANA chip into the southbridge chip, and used either the traditional 16MB NAND, or a 4GB \\"Phison\\" eMMC. \\"Corona\\" was used in both the Xbox 360 S and Xbox 360 E. In August 2014, the \\"Winchester\\" model was released, with a new XCGPU. This chip removes the heatspreader and integrated the eDRAM into the main die on the XCGPU. This version also patches the Reset Glitch Hack.

Released with 500GB console bundles } == Connectivity to accessories == An Xbox 360 Wireless Controller The Xbox 360 features three USB 2.0 ports (two on the front, one on the back). The Xbox 360 S, however, has five USB 2.0 ports (two on the front, three in the back) along with a dedicated Kinect port. The Xbox 360 E has four ports (two on the front, two on the back) and a dedicated Kinect port. These are used for connection of accessories such as wired controllers, the wireless networking adapter, the Xbox Live Vision camera and USB storage devices. Although the number of wired controllers is limited by the number of ports, up to four may be used through the use of a USB hub. The Xbox 360 also features wireless connectivity of accessories via a proprietary 2.4 GHz radio system. This is mainly used to connect the official wireless controllers, but is also used for other devices such as the wireless racing wheel and wireless headsets. With the exception of some rhythm game controllers, and the Fanatec CSR wheel, this wireless connectivity is limited to first-party Microsoft accessories. The Xbox 360 can connect to Xbox Live over the Internet through a variety of networking interfaces. Original style consoles also have two front-mounted memory card slots for the system's proprietary Memory Unit. These can be used to transfer profile and game data from one Xbox 360 to another. Memory Units up to 512 MB are available from Microsoft. The \\"Arcade\\" model formerly came with a 256 MB Memory Unit, but with the Jasper motherboard revision of September 2008, the \\"Arcade\\" model began to include 256 MB of built-in flash memory. This was later increased to 512 MB. The memory card slots were replaced with USB ports on the newer Xbox 360 S models. The Universal Media Remote can be used to control several functions of the console, including the Windows Media Center functions if connected to the network. It communicates with the console via infrared through a receiver port on the front of the console. All standard controllers for the system feature a 2.5 mm headset jack to allow the use of wired headsets for voice chatting. They also feature a custom USB connector, which is currently only used for connection of the chatpad keyboard accessory. Various other accessories for the console exist, such as decorative faceplates to change the physical appearance of the console. == Physical appearance == Left: Xbox 360 Elite, Right: Xbox 360 S with new-style controller The physical outline of the original style Xbox 360 is and is similar in form factor to its predecessor. It is slightly slimmer in every dimension and is slightly concave, while the original Xbox was noticeably convex. It comes as standard in either black or white, with other colors available as special editions. It was designed by Astro Studios in cooperation with Hers Experimental Design Laboratory. In June 2010 a redesign of the console, known as the Xbox 360 S, was announced. This version of the console retains the same basic shape but is noticeably smaller and more angular than the original version. It comes as standard in either matte or glossy black; like its predecessor, other colors are available as special editions. The front of the console features a \\"ring of light\\" that displays four illuminated quadrants in either red or green (except the redesigned console which only has green lights). When the lights turn red, the console has encountered an error, with the number of sectors illuminated informing the user what category the error falls into. Since the redesign of the console removed the red LEDs, this error reporting system is no longer used. The original Xbox 360 weighs approximately , about 350 grams heavier than the new Xbox. The new version weighs in at .  Power supply  The console uses an external power supply with a 10 A/100‚Äì120 V or 5 A/220-230 V (AC) input and DC output rated at 203/175/150/130/115 W (depending on revision). An estimated 2 W of power are used while the older versions of console are in standby mode giving a yearly usage of approximately 17.5 kWh. The new version uses around 0.5W while in standby. Saving the console size and weight, the power supply displaces . Xbox 360 power supplies are designed with keys in the plug to be forwards, but not backwards compatible. For example, a 203 watt supply would fit and work on a 175 watt console, but not the other way around. == See also == * Xbox 360 technical problems == Notes == :1.Video output and system control chip. == References  External links == * * Xbox Development Team Blog Category:Computer-related introductions in 2005 Category:Backward-compatible video game consoles Category:PowerPC-based video game consoles Category:Video game hardware Category:Xbox 360 hardware ","title":"Xbox 360 technical specifications"},{"id":"12366113","text":"The Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding (ACMCU) is an interfaith institution based at the Georgetown University School of Foreign Service in Washington, D.C.. ==Overview== The institution was founded at Georgetown University in 1993 as the Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding.

There develops a self-perpetuating rapid and abnormal activation. (\\"Circus Movement\\" is another term for this.) Conditions necessary for re-entry include a combination of unidirectional block and slowed conduction.Am J Cardiol. 1984 Jul 30;54(2):1A-6A. Circus movement may also occur on a smaller scale within the AV node (dual AV nodal physiology), a large bypass tract is not necessary.Cardiovascular Physiology & Anesthesia. Morgan, Jr. GE, Mikhail MS, Murray MJ. Chapter 19. Clinical Anesthesiology. 4th ed. New York: McGraw-Hill; 2006. Re-entry is divided into two major types: [Anatomically Defined] re-entry and [Functionally Defined] re-entry. The circus movement can occur around an anatomical or functional core. Either type may occur alone, or together. Anatomically defined re-entry has a fixed anatomic pathway. Anomalous conduction via accessory pathways (APs) create the re-entry circuit (which are also called bypass tracts), that exist between the atria and ventricles. Wolff‚ÄìParkinson‚ÄìWhite syndrome (WPW) is an example of anatomically defined re-entry. WPW syndrome is an atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardia (AVRT), secondary to an accessory pathway that connects the epicardial surfaces of the atrium and ventricle along the AV groove.Hurst's The Heart, 13e.(2011). Chapter 41. Supraventricular Tachycardia: Atrioventricular Nodal Reentry and Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome. The majority of time symptomatic WPW fits the definition of AVRT (Supraventricular tachycardia) however AVNRT (dual AV nodal physiology) exist in ~10% of patients with WPW syndrome creating the possibility of spontaneous atrial fibrillation degenerating into ventricular fibrillation (VF). The fact that WPW patients are young and do not have structural heart disease, lead to using catheter ablation of the APs with the elimination of the atrial fibrillation as well as the episodes of re-entrant ventricular tachycardia. This elimination of the atrial fibrillation with ablation implies APs have some pathophysiologic role in the development of a-fib in the WPW patient. Functionally defined re-entry does not require the alternative anatomically defined circuit accessory pathways and it may not reside in just one location.Goodman & Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics. 12th ed. Sampson KJ, Kass RS. Chapter 29. Anti-Arrhythmic Drugs. Ventricular fibrillation (VF) following ventricular tachycardia (VT) may be described as a functionally defined re-entry problem caused by multiple mini re-entrant circuits spontaneously created within the ventricular myocardium. The original re-entrant circuit breaks down into multiple mini reentrant circuits.Hurst's The Heart, Chapter 38. Mechanisms of Cardiac Arrhythmias and Conduction Disturbances. In V. Fuster, R.A. Walsh, R.A. Harrington (Eds) (VF becoming the grand finale of a single prolonged VT larger circus movement, propagating change in the \\"functional core\\" of the ventricular myocardium, dissipating mini reentrant circuits, exhibited as ventricular fibrillation.) Ischemia, electrolyte, pH abnormalities, or bradycardia are potential causes of functionally defined re-entry due to changes in the properties of the cardiac tissue's functional core. (No accessory pathway required). For reentry to occur, the path length of circuit should be greater than the wave length (ERP √ó conduction velocity) of impulse. ==See also== * AV reentrant tachycardia * AV nodal reentrant tachycardia ==References External links == Category:Cardiac arrhythmia ","title":"Re-entry ventricular arrhythmia"},{"id":"12366121","text":"New York Soccer Club was the name of a New York soccer team that, in 1930, played briefly in the American Soccer League.

Of the various viral diseases inflicting legume crops, Mungbean Yellow Mosaic disease is one of the most destructive and widely distributed. The disease has been reported from various countries. ==Region-specific outbreaks== Yellow mosaic disease of many legumes in India and other South Asian countries is transmitted by geminiviruses belonging to the family Geminiviridae and genus the Begomovirus. Four species, Mungbean yellow mosaic virus (MYMV), Mungbean yellow mosaic India virus (MYMIV), Dolichos yellow mosaic virus (DYMV) and Horsegram yellow mosaic virus (HYMV), are known to cause yellow mosaic disease in different leguminous species. Mungbean yellow mosaic India virus (MYMIV) is a bipartite Begomovirus from the family Geminiviridae and is reported to be the causative agent of the disease in India. ==Symptoms== Mungbean yellow mosaic disease is characterized by a bright yellow mosaic on the leaves of infected plants and causes significant losses to mungbean (Vigna radiata) crops in India. ==Host species== Geminiviruses infect a wide variety of crop plants, devastating some of the economically important plants ranging from dicots to monocots. These lead to major agro-economical losses worldwide, and are subjects of immense concern. The most affected leguminous crops by MYMIV are pigeon peas (Cajanus cajan), soybeans (Glycine max), mat beans (Phaseolus aconitifolius), common beans (P. aureus), French beans (P. vulgaris), and black lentils (Vigna mungo). ==Disease transmission== Yellow mosaic disease of many legumes is often transmitted by silverfly (Bemisia tabaci). == Viral structure== These are plant viruses which have single-stranded circular DNA genomes encoding genes that diverge in both directions from a virion strand origin of replication (i.e. geminivirus genomes are ambisense). According to the Baltimore classification, they are considered to be class II viruses. The genome can either be a single component between 2500 and 3100 nucleotides, or, in the case of some begomoviruses, two similar-sized components each between 2600 and 2800 nucleotides. They have elongated, geminate capsids with two incomplete T=1 icosahedra joined at the missing vertex. The capsids range in size from 18‚Äì20 nm in diameter with a length of about 30 nm. Geminiviruses constitute a large family of phytopathogens (Geminiviridae). The family geminiviridae have been classified into four genera, namely Begomovirus, Curtovirus, Topocuvirus and Mastrevirus, depending on their genomes, mode of transmission and host range. Geminiviridae are transmitted by white flies, scientifically known as Bamesia tabacci. The genus begomoviridae generally comprises bipartite (two components, namely DNA- ‚ÄòA‚Äô and ‚ÄòB‚Äô) genome, which replicates via rolling circle (RCR) model with the help of few viral and several host factors. Mungbean yellow mosaic India virus (MYMIV) is a representative of the genus begomovirus / Begomoviridae, which is prevalent in northern part of Indian subcontinent causing yellow mosaic disease (YMD). MYMIV possesses bipartite ssDNA genomes named as DNA-A and DNA-B, both being ~2.7 kb in size. Both components share a common region (CR) of about 200 bp containing the important cis-elements for viral DNA transcription and rolling circle replication (RCR). ==References== Navneet Kumar Yadav, Central Drug Research Institute(CDRI), Lucknow INDIA . ==External links== *ICTVdB - The Universal Virus Database: Mung bean yellow mosaic virus *Family Groups - The Baltimore Method Category:Begomovirus Category:Viral plant pathogens and diseases Category:Soybean diseases ","title":"Mungbean yellow mosaic virus"},{"id":"12366127","text":"The Guardians of the Peace () were a pro-government paramilitary militia active in Burundi during the Burundian Civil War (1993‚Äì2006).

The Nova Igua√ßu volcano theory is now extinct in academic communities, but the myth continues in sightseeing promotion groups. Recent research revealed that volcanic eruptions did occur in the Nova Igua√ßu region. After the eruptions, an intense uplifting and consequent regional denudation took place. The cones, craters, lavas, pyroclastic flow deposits, and volcanic bombs have been washed away in the strong tropical erosion of this region, exposing the underlying geologic structure. The Municipal Park is underlain by the geologic bodies corresponding to the magma chamber (composed of syenite and trachyte) and subvolcanic conduit (made up of pyroclastic rocks) of a depth of 3 kilometers, such as pyroclastic dikes. That is, no extinct volcano is present at Nova Igua√ßu. The outcrops are world-rare geological phenomena that expose the underground geologic structures of the volcanic area. ==Locality== The debated volcano is in the Municipality of Nova Igua√ßu, about 35 kilometers to the west-northwest of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It is a horseshoe-shaped valley opening to the north at the north-east flank of the Mendanha massif, about 2 kilometers south-southeast of the Nova Igua√ßu railway station. It is 800 meters long, 700 meters wide, and 180 meters deep at . This area is surrounded by peaks more than 400 meters high, such as Contenda Rock, Austral Rock, Confeito Rock, and Contento Peak, which are underlain by pyroclastic rock. This rock originated from rock fragments created by a volcanic explosion. The valley is made up of trachyte, another igneous rock with massive texture. The pyroclastic rock was the main justification of the Nova Igua√ßu Volcano hypothesis. ==Proposal of the volcano hypothesis== The existence of a volcano at Nova Igua√ßu was proposed by geologists Viktor Carvalho Klein and Andr√© Calixto Vieira in the 1980s. Klein and Vieira based their discovery on the presence of pyroclastic rocks (including volcanic bombs) and the existence of a volcanic crater. They believed the pyroclastic rock to be pyroclastic flow deposits, constituting an ‚Äúextraordinary well-preserved complete volcanic edifice‚Äù.Klein, V.C., Valen√ßa, J.G., Vieira, A.C. 1984.

(in√©dito) However, their work was not published in scientific journals, and therefore the Nova Igua√ßu Volcano hypothesis did not receive the attention and scrutiny necessary to transform it into an academically accepted scientific theory. ==Later development== In the early-to-mid-2000s (decade), a research group composed of geologists from several Brazilian institutions conducted additional geological studies into the existence of a volcano at Nova Igua√ßu. Some members of the group agreed with Vieira that a volcanic crater existed at Nova Igua√ßu (Loc. 1).Medeiros & Ragatky, 2004; Geraldes & Netto, 2004 However, other members disagreed because the supposed crater is underlain by massive trachyte, not volcanic breccia.Silveira et al., 2005; Valente et al., 2005 ==Public awareness== In 2004, the Rio de Janeiro State Department of Mineral Resources (DRM-RJ) started a public information campaign about the geology of Nova Igua√ßu with special attention given to the Municipal Park and the theories concerning the extinct volcano. As a part of the project, panel- plates with information about the hypothesis of the Nova Igua√ßu VolcanoMansur et al., 2004 were placed in strategic locations around the area and included on the DRM-RJ homepage.Ghizi et al., 2004 Brazilian media began publicizing the hypothesis of a volcano at Nova Igua√ßu based on interviews with a geologist who stated it was the only area in Brazil with clear morphology of a volcanic crater and a volcanic cone. In 2004, the Nova Igua√ßu Topshopping held the Volcano Exposition,Topshopping Nova Igua√ßu, 2004 and the Rio de Janeiro State Financial Tribunary declared the volcanic crater to be a natural sightseeing attraction point of Nova Igua√ßu and Mesquita.TCR-RJ, 2004 The Nova Igua√ßu Municipal Government and the Mesquita Municipal Government helped to distribute the information. These non-academic sources had a special interest in the volcanic crater, commenting that an extremely long eruption lasting from 72 million years ago until 40 million years ago was incompatible with the scientific study of Earth‚Äôs volcanoes. In early 2005, numerous media, governmental, and scientific sources reported that mining activity of the Vign√© Quarry (Loc. 7) was destroying Brazil's only intact volcano.Folha de S.Paulo; CPRM (2005), Brazilian Geological Survey; MTC (2005), Brazilian Ministry of Technology and Science; SBPC (2005), Brazilian Society of Progress of Science; FUNDEP (2005), Brazilian Foundation of Research Development; FAPERJ (2005), Rio de Janeiro State Foundation of Research Support; Nova Igua√ßu (2005) Municipal Government A judicial process was sent to the Public Ministry of the State of Rio de Janeiro, requiring the immediate interdiction of the quarry. The last report confirmed a volcanic edifice but denied the volcanic crater, recommending reopening mining on a reduced scale.Valente et al., 2005 The Nova Igua√ßu Volcano theory expanded to become a social phenomenon. Sightseeing, commercial, artistic, administrative, and educational activities took place, as if the hypothesis was an established scientific theory.GuiaCamp, 2006; Carioquinha 2006; Trilha a P√©, 2006; Tirus Baixada, 2007 The environmental education was a notable regional highlight.Guedes & Mansur, 2004; Geraldes, 2006a; b The city of Nova Igua√ßu adopted traffic signs with volcanic images. A movement began to register the Municipal Park to the UNESCO as ‚ÄúGeopark of the Nova Igua√ßu Volcano‚Äù. Some scientific eventsGeraldes & Netto, 2004a; b; Geraldes, 2006a; Mansur et al., 2004 and the homepage of the DRM-RJGhizi et al., 2004; Medeiros et al., 2004 referred to the Municipal Park as the Geopark. Certain newspapers printed, based on the interviews of another geologist, that the UERJ and Petrobr√°s (Brazilian National Petroleum Company) were investing one million dollars over two years in researching the oilfield by means of the Nova Igua√ßu Volcano.Clipping UERJ, 2005; UERJ em Dia, 2005, ; Jornal do Brasil, 2005; Jornal Saber Ci√™ncia, 2005; Gaspet SC, 2005 ==Scientific doubts== The first scientific article concerning Nova Igua√ßu geology was published in 2006.Motoki & Sichel, 2006 In the article, and at several scientific events, Akihisa Motoki presented a case against the existence of a volcano at Nova Igua√ßu, showing that the geology and morphology of Nova Igua√ßu are incompatible with the volcanic model. No article defending the volcano hypothesis has been published in a qualified scientific journal. ==Geological discussion== Volcanic crater A volcanic crater is a circular negative morphology formed after an explosive eruption.MacDonald, 1972; Motoki et al., 2007a The eruption forms breccia with large clasts, called explosion breccia. The DRM-RJ states the crater is present in a horseshoe-shaped valley situated about 2 kilometers to the south of the urban zone. Vieira & Klein presented the north-south geologic cross-section of the supposed crater, showing a prominent volcanic cone.Vieira & Klein (2004) However, the topographic map of this area does not exhibit morphologic characteristics. The inner walls of the valley are not sub-vertical, but have a shallow angle of 15 to 20¬∞, comparable to a slope formed by erosion. Klein & Vieira inferred that the supposed crater area might be underlain by volcanic agglomerate, that is, volcanic breccia with large clasts.Klein & Vieira (1980b) The rock is trachyte and thus disproves the volcanic crater theory. Volcanic cone The volcanic cone corresponds to the cone-formed positive morphology originated from the accumulation of solid eruptive materials. Vieira & Klein presented an illustration of the Nova Igua√ßu volcanic cone, of 1.7 kilometers in diameter, 250 meters in relative height, and 27¬∞ in flank angle. If so, the cone must appear prominently on the north-eastern flank of the Mendanha massif, and be easily recognized from Nova Igua√ßu and neighbouring cities; however, such a cone is not seen or confirmed by topographic map and satellite images.Motoki et al., 2007a Volcanic bomb A volcanic bomb is one type of essential fragment originating from a magma drop, launched from the crater in viscous semi-solid state. Indications of vesiculation, volume expansion, and plastic deformation are observed. In case of high-viscosity magma, such as andesite and dacite, the consolidated clast surface is cracked by the volume expansion originated from vesiculation. Such a bomb is called bread-crust bomb. Silveira et al. (2005) and Valente et al. (2005) proved that more than 50% of the clast present in the volcanic agglomerate of the Contenda Rock are volcanic bombs. Klein & Vieira (1980b) and Klein et al. (2001) commented on the presence of bread-crust bomb. However, Motoki et al. (2007b) revealed that these clasts are not porous, but composed of massive trachyte. In addition, no signs of plastic deformation are observed. The altered clast surface with porous appearance is attributed to weathering of fabrics, namely pseudovesicular structure. Therefore, it is concluded that no volcanic bomb is present at Nova Igua√ßu. Lava flow Geraldes & Netto (2004a; b), Silveira et al. (2005) and Valente et al. (2005) concluded that the trachyte of this area was made up of lava flows which covered the erosion surface of the syenitic rock. If so, the trachyte must be younger than the syenite. However, field observation of the contact outcrops demonstrated that the trachyte intrudes into the metamorphic syenite, forming an intrusive body older than the syenite (Motoki et al., 2007a). Geraldes & Netto (2004a; b), Silveira et al. (2005) and Valente et al. (2005) considered that the trachyte is distributed only along the valley of the crater in a strip 2 kilometers long and less than 100 meters thick. This body has a horizontal extension larger than 15 kilometers and stretches from the base to the top of the Mendanha massif, with more than an 800-meter drop in elevation (Motoki et al., 2007a). Valente et al. (2005) show isolated occurrences of hexagonal fractures as evidence of trachyte lava flow. The trachyte does not have the characteristics of lava flow and lava dome (Motoki et al., 2007a). The hexagonal fractures were identified to be horizontal columnar joints of trachyte dike. These geological observations indicate that the trachyte is an intrusive body, being the oldest body of the felsic alkaline magmatism of this area, and is clearly different from the lava flows overlying the eroded surface of the syenite. Pyroclastic flow Klein & Vieira (1980a; b), Klein et al. (1984), Geraldes & Netto (2004a), Silveira et al. (2005), Valente et al. (2005), etc., concluded the pyroclastic rocks and their neighbours present at the Contenda Rock are pyroclastic flows, using the layered structure as proof. Motoki et al. (2007c) concluded the development degree and horizontal continuity of the pyroclastic textures are too poor for a pyroclastic flow deposit. The pyroclastic rocks along the Eug√™nia River are exposed, forming pyroclastic dykes, presenting underground subvolcanic fissures. If the pyroclastic rocks originated from pyroclastic flows, the deposits should have been widely present in the Fluminense lowland, such as Mesquita, Nilopolis, Nova Igua√ßu, and Duque de Caxias. Welded pyroclastic rocks resist weathering and are therefore easily identified. Such volcanic deposits are not found in the Fluminense lowland. This confirms that these pyroclastic rocks were not created in pyroclastic flows. ==Present conclusion of the scientific works== In recent years, the hypothesis of the Nova Igua√ßu volcano has been an ardent discussion in scientific events and geological journals, being a controversial theme of the local geology. Research has clarified the inexistence of crater, cone, bomb, lava, and pyroclastic flow, and the scientific problems of the previous works were pointed out one by one. In this situation, the research groups favorable to the volcano hypothesis maintain their silence in academic communities. In this way, the geological studies of Nova Igua√ßu are arriving at a new paradigm, that is, the inexistence of Nova Igua√ßu Volcano. ==References== * Carioquinha. 2006.

In the Mazandarani language of Iran, \\"pintek\\" means \\"pentad\\"; in the Mazanderani calendar, the year is divided into 12 thirty-day months and one pentad of days, often beginning on March 21. Neowrez Khani is one of the strongest and most popular traditions of the Mazanderani people. The last Wednesday of the old winter is known as \\"Kal Char Shenba\\". On this day, every family builds a fire in front of their house, and every member of the family jumps over it while saying \\"Burea Qa o Biyea Shadi\\", bidding sadness to go and joy to stay. Households also prepare a soup called Ach and offer it to their neighbors. As a sign of kindness to one another, the Ach dish is not washed. About fifteen days before spring arrives, groups of singers are formed, and they go from house to house. In return, it is customary for the householders to give them gifts or to offer them sweets, candies, eggs, peas, and other foods. In Mazanderani culture, it is disrespectful to offer them money. One song includes the lyrics: which translates as: On the thirteenth day of spring, women of each village, with their relatives and friends from neighbouring villages, gather to spend time and have fun together. Elsewhere in the village, men hold a wrestling competition that lasts from morning until evening. ==See also== * Nowruz * Kurdish celebration of Newroz ==References== * Dr. Sadeq Kia, 1937, Tabarian Calendars and Festivals (Gahshomari va Jashnaye Tabari -Persian-) Category:Mazandarani culture ","title":"Nowruz Eve among Mazandarani people"},{"id":"12366193","text":"In mathematics, a Hilbert‚ÄìSchmidt integral operator is a type of integral transform.

It was originally a medieval priory or cell of Augustinian Canons in Harrow Weald, then in Middlesex. There are no remains of the original priory, but it probably stood near Priory House, off Clamp Hill.Victoria County History, Middlesex, Harrow including Pinner, Manors, 1971 In 1775, Sir John Soane designed a large mansion house north of the original priory, called Bentley Priory, for the wealthy businessman James Duberley. This was added to throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries by various owners. It was significantly extended in 1788, again by Sir John Soane, for John Hamilton, 1st Marquess of Abercorn. The priory was the final home of the Dowager Queen Adelaide, queen consort of William IV, before her death there in 1849. It subsequently served as a hotel and girls' school before being acquired by the Royal Air Force in 1926. In the Second World War, Bentley Priory was the headquarters of RAF Fighter Command, and it remained in RAF hands in various roles until 2008. As of 2013, the site has been sold to a developer and plans to convert some of the building to luxury apartments and build new houses have been approved and construction commenced. The Bentley Priory Battle of Britain Trust has secured part of the building to be used as a museum and memorial dedicated to those who served in the RAF. ==The priory== Roman remains have been found in the grounds of the priory.Victoria County History, Middlesex, Harrow including Pinner, Introduction, 1971 The name 'Bentley' is thought to derive from 'beonet', a kind of coarse grass.J. E. B. Cover, The Place Names of Middlesex, Longmans, 1922 Medieval beginnings Heriot Wood, in the grounds of the Priory, probably dates back to the end of last Ice AgeNature Conservation Forum, Bentley Priory Nature Reserve, 2007 Although little detail is known, the lands of Bentley Priory and the surrounding area were scantily populated but civilised long before the time of the Romans. At the time the first Priory was dedicated, the majority of the area was in the Manor of Harrow. The rest of the land in which the Priory now stands was in the area held by the Count of Mortain and known as Stanmore Magna. Although the area was in part heavily wooded, many Anglo Saxon finds have been made indicating thriving communities around Brockley Hill and Harrow Weald Common. Professor J E B Gover in his book Place Names of Middlesex, derives the word Bentley from Anglo-Saxon: the prefix Bent from 'beonet', a kind of coarse grass or bent grass and the suffix ley from 'leah, a tract of cultivated or cultivable land, a piece of land cleared from forest for pasture, etc. Thus the name Bentley would seem to mean land artificially cleared of coarse grass for pasture or cultivation. By the time the Domesday Book was compiled in 1086, William the Conqueror had invested his own bishop (Lansfranc) with the Archbishopric of Canterbury and restored the lands of Harrow, appropriated by King Edward the Confessor, to the Church. The original Priory, which was the only monastic establishment in the Manor of Harrow, housed a cell of Augustinian Friars.'Harrow on the Hill: Priory of Bentley', in D. Lysons, The Environs of London, Vol. 2: County of Middlesex (London 1795), pp. 559-88 (British History Online).W. Dugdale, ed. J. Caley, 'Austin Priory of Benethley, or Bentley, in Middlesex', in Monasticon Anglicanum, Vol. 6 Part 1 (T.G. March, London 1849), pp. 544-45 (Google). Bentley Priory is (doubtfully) said to have been founded in 1171 by Ranulf de Glanvill, who was King Henry II's Justiciar from 1180 to 1189.The V.C.H. cites J. Tavenor-Perry, Memorials of Old Middlesex (Bemrose and Sons Limited, London 1909), p. 11 for this statement, where it stands entirely unsupported. This seems to be a mistake for Butley Priory, Suffolk, which was certainly founded as an Augustinian house by Ranulf in 1171. It was dedicated to St. Mary Magdalene, and was in the patronage of the Archbishop of Canterbury. It may have been founded as a cell of St Gregory's Priory, Canterbury, and was certainly under its rule by 1301, when the prior of Bentley was reported to have let a farm without the approval of his superior, the prior of St Gregory's.Victoria County History, Middlesex, Religious Houses, House of Augustinian canons, 1969 In 1243, the king pardoned the prior the interest on 60 shillings which he had borrowed from the Jews, and in 1291 the prior's goods at Stanmore were valued at 10 shillings, and land and rents in Wotton at 13s 4d. It is referred to in the early 14th century, but according to the court rolls of manor of Harrow in 1535, St Gregory's had ceased to maintain a cell at Bentley many years earlier. The first Priory was reported by Druett in his book, The Stanmores and Harrow Weald Through the Ages, to stand further downhill than the present building. He places it in the area of Priory House on Clamp Hill, with the chapel standing apart on Harrow Weald Common. However, the evidence to substantiate this is inconclusive. It would appear that a small agricultural hamlet existed in the shadow of the Priory Chapel. This Chapel, of which all trace has been lost, is believed to have served the 'city' community that lived on the Weald. Apart from a short list of Priors from this period in The Victoria County History of Middlesex, the only other reference to the Priory is in Chronicle by Matthew Paris who was a monk and chief copyist at St Albans. He mentions under the date 1248 the story 'Of the Miserable Death of the Priory of Bentley'. Apparently a hayrick fell upon him whilst he was inspecting it. Another early reference to the Priory can be found in The Harrow Rolls of 1512, These state that: > 'The Priory was built in honour of St Mary Magdalene, and the Archbishop of > Canterbury beyond memory gave the Priory with all its lands to the Priory of > St Gregory without the wall of Canterbury, and to the convent there in pure > alms; that they from time of such grant used to find a priest to celebrate > Mass and other divine services in the chapel within the Priory each week, > and that the priest used to be called the Prior of Bentley'. :\\"Thus Bentley Priory and its lands, apart from being passed back and forth between church and lay owners in its early years, managed to avoid falling into the covetous hands of its neighbours.\\" St Gregory's was dissolved in 1536, and the buildings and land of the former Bentley Priory were granted to Archbishop Cranmer, but in 1542 he was forced to hand them back to the king, and in 1546 they were granted to Henry Needham and William Sacheverell. Subsequent buildings A print by an unknown artist of Bentley Priory House, Stanmore, England c1800. In 1775, Sir John Soane designed a new house north of the original priory called Bentley Priory,Harrow Heritage Trust, Bentley Priory Nature Reserve for James Duberley, an Army contractor. Duberley is thought to have pulled down the original Priory building before having a more imposing house built on a higher point of the ridge some distance from the original site. Druett based his idea that the original site of the Priory can be found further down the slope at Priory House on the supposition that Duberley would have built higher on the ridge, 'to show off the evidence of his wealth and importance'. The house was sold in 1788 to John Hamilton, who succeeded his uncle as Earl of Abercorn in 1789.Victoria County History, Middlesex, Harrow including Pinner, Social history, 1971 On his elevation in the peerage the following year to Marquess, he made extensive alterations to the house and park. He commissioned Sir John Soane, one of the most pre- eminent 18th century architects, to extend and refurbish the house in a more lavish and sumptuous manner, and the outside of the house as it appears today is largely due to his money and Soane's vision (although the clock tower was added at a later date). The refurbishments included a gallery of fine paintings, several large apartments and a grand staircase of Portland stone; the intricate wooden banister is thought to have been added by Sir John Kelk. In the early 1860s, Sir Robert Smirke (architect of the British Museum) was commissioned by the Marquess to make further additions to the Priory. The Marquess lived at the Priory as a true nobleman of his day. He was the only man who held peerage titles in all three kingdoms: England, Scotland and Ireland. As a result of his influence, the Priory soon became a rendezvous for many political and literary celebrities. Visitors included Pitt, Wellington, Canning, the Lords Liverpool and Sidmouth, and the poets Woodworth, Moore, and Campbell. Sir William and Lady Emma Hamilton (who was later the mother of Lord Nelson's illegitimate daughter Horatia) and thespians Mrs Sarah Siddons and John Kemble were attracted to the beautiful surroundings. Sir Walter Scott was a frequent visitor in 1807, spending much of his time in the summerhouse which was built on an island in the lake, writing and revising Marmion. The lake is still in existence as part of the Bentley Priory Nature Reserve, but can no longer be seen from the Priory due to the growth of surrounding trees. It is also no longer part of the Bentley Priory land. James Hamilton, a boy of seven when he became the second Marquess of Abercorn, took up residence in the Priory with his guardian, Lord Aberdeen. As well as being his uncle by marriage, Aberdeen became his stepfather in 1815 when he married the widow of Lord Hamilton. Until 1832, when James came of age, the Priory became the principal rendezvous of the Tory Party. Upon reaching his majority, the second Marquess married and lived only intermittently at the Priory. His third son, Lord Ernest Hamilton, says in his reminiscences that his father was 'compelled to leave Stanmore in self-preservation'. The house was so close to London that many of his friends visited. They were so enamoured of the place that Lady Blessington had called 'the most singular place on Earth' that they outstayed their welcome. The family became nomadic, searching for a place to settle in England and living in furnished houses while their possessions were packed away. Queen Adelaide Princess Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen (1792 - 1849), consort of William IV, spent her final years at Bentley Priory. In 1846, Dowager Queen Adelaide, widow of William IV, leased the Priory, but it was not until 1848 that she finally moved in. By this time, she was quite ill from dropsy, and on her arrival apparently found the stairs too much to cope with. A suite of rooms were prepared for her on the ground floor, and it was in these rooms that she would receive Queen Victoria, her niece, and Prince Albert during their visits. Speculation remains over the reason for the decoration of the ceiling in the room we call today the Adelaide Room. It was long believed that the ceiling was painted with frescos depicting the Arts and four Seasons to give Queen Adelaide something of interest to look at while lying sick in bed. However, on the basis of evidence obtained from the Royal Library at Windsor Castle, it now seems likely that she actually used the area of the present VIP suite for her bedroom and that this was where she died on 2 December 1849 at the age of 57. After Queen Adelaide's death, the Priory was scarcely used until the estate was bought by Sir John Kelk in 1863. Sir John Kelk was an eminent Victorian engineer and the contractor for the Albert Memorial. He also donated the lychgate and lectern to Stanmore Church. The lych gate is still in existence and in regular use. Sir John began immediate improvements to the Priory spending ¬£9,000 on the conservatories alone (demolished in 1939 in order to provide additional office space). He also added a picture gallery, a library, the clock tower, an orangery (which stood some way in front of the present main entrance) a cedar garden and a deer park. Gordon Hotels Frederick Gordon built the Stanmore branch line to bring guests to Bentley Priory In its heyday, the Priory estate boasted no fewer than 20 gardeners. A Tuscan portico was added to the garden in front of the house (now the back) at about this time. The magnificent Oriental Plane tree was brought from abroad and planted around this time. In 1882, the Priory was bought by Frederick Gordon, of Gordon Hotels, who converted it into a residential hotel. In 1884, he built a house, 'Glenthorn', in the Priory grounds for his family to live in. On the front of the house was the Gordon Badge (a flexed bow and arrow) and motto Fortuna Sequatur, which means 'Let's Fortune Attend'. Despite surviving two World Wars, the house is no longer standing. Access to the hotel from London was not ideal, so Gordon had the railway line extended from Harrow to Stanmore via the Stanmore branch line for the convenience of his guests. The railway cost ¬£48,000 which Gordon raised by means of ¬£36,000 in shares and ¬£12,000 in debenture bonds. The remains of the old station can still be seen incorporated into a new building at the entrance to Gordon Avenue. It is almost certain that Gordon tried to sell the Priory in 1895. Despite access to the Gordon Family records and research by Debenham, Tewson & Chinnocks who still practice in the city, no reason for the failure of the hotel has been identified nor why it was not auctioned unless, of course, it failed to meet its reserve price. Despite the railway, the hotel was never a financial success, so the Gordons and their eleven children moved from 'Glenthorn' into the Priory and lived there until the death of Frederick Gordon in 1908. School days The Priory changed hands yet again and was re-opened as a girls school. The school housed 70 boarders, and as part of its music focus, maintained a number of pianos in separate soundproof rooms.http://bentleypriorymuseum.org.uk/bentley-priory-collection/bentley- priory-painting/ For several years the school prospered as a female preserve. Male staff were required to leave by 9:30pm when the gates were locked. Any man inadvertently entering the grounds was politely but rapidly removed. Local actor and journalist Pete Knobbler referred to his great-uncle's attempt to remain in the school after hours in an article published in the Harrow Observer in 1983. After World War I, the school ran into financial trouble. At the end of the winter term, 28 December 1924, the school gates closed for good. ==RAF Bentley Priory== Air Chief Marshal Sir Hugh Dowding accompanying King George VI and Queen Elizabeth during a visit to Bentley Priory in September 1940.

Along with A System of Logic, Principles of Political Economy established Mill's reputation as a leading public intellectual. Mill's sympathetic attitude in this work and in other essays toward contemporary socialism, particularly Fourierism, earned him esteem from the working class as one of their intellectual champions. ==Preface and Preliminary Remarks== Mill's Principles were written in a style of prose far flung from the introductory texts of today. Devoid of the mathematical graphs and formulae that were only developed after his death, principally by Alfred Marshall, Mill wrote with the rich tone of grandeur that is found in all his books. His book continued to be used well into the twentieth century as the foundational textbook, for instance in Oxford University until 1919. * Preliminary remarks ==Book I Production== ;I Of the Requisites of Production Mill explores the nature of production, beginning with labour and its relationship to nature. He starts by stating, that the \\"requisites of production are two: labour, and appropriate natural objects.\\" A discussion follows of man's connection to the natural world, and how man must labour to utilise almost anything found in the natural world. He uses a rich array of imagery, from the sewing of cloth, to the turning of wheels and the creation of steam. Man has found a way to harness nature, so that \\"the muscular action necessary for this is not constantly renewed, but performed once for all, and there is on the whole a great economy of labour.\\" He then turns on the view of who \\"takes the credit\\" for industry. \\"Some writers,\\" he says, > \\"have raised the question, whether nature gives more assistance to labour in > one kind of industry or in another; and have said that in some occupations > labour does most, in others nature most. In this, however, there seems much > confusion of ideas. The part which nature has in any work of man, is > indefinite and incommensurable. It is impossible to decide that in any one > thing nature does more than in any other. One cannot even say that labour > does less. Less labour may be required; but if that which is required is > absolutely indispensable, the result is just as much the product of labour, > as of nature. When two conditions are equally necessary for producing the > effect at all, it is unmeaning to say that so much of it is produced by one > and so much by the other; it is like attempting to decide which half of a > pair of scissors has most to do in the act of cutting; or which of the > factors, five and six, contributes most to the production of thirty.\\" He refers to former French Economists and Adam Smith, who thought land rents were higher because there was more nature being provided. In fact, says Mill, the simple answer is that land is scarce, which is what enables greater rent exaction. He mentions that many things are limited in abundance, for instance, Arctic whale fishing, which could not keep supplied the demand. This alludes to an introductory principle of value, that \\"as soon as there is not so much of the thing to be had, as would be appropriated and used if it could be obtained for asking; the ownership or use of the natural agent acquires an exchangeable value.\\" ;II Of Labour as an Agent of Production ;III Of Unproductive Labour ;IV Of Capital Capital, says Mill, is \\"the accumulated stock of the produce of labour\\". Though its nature is misunderstood. He gives an example of the consumption of food, as opposed to assets allocated for production. > \\"The distinction, then, between Capital and Not-capital, does not lie in the > kind of commodities, but in the mind of the capitalist ‚Äì in his will to > employ them for one purpose rather than another; and all property, however > ill adapted in itself for the use of labourers, is a part of capital, so > soon as it, or the value to be received from it, is set apart for productive > reinvestment.\\" Capital, like labour, can be unemployed, and Mill gives an example of inefficient taxation of productive capital. Then he observes the surplus to living standards created by industrialism. > \\"Finally, that large portion of the productive capital of a country which is > employed in paying the wages and salaries of labourers, evidently is not, > all of it, strictly and indispensably necessary for production.

Mill's answer was that international trade benefited most the country whose demand for goods is most elastic.

The first followed the Malthusian line that population grew quicker than supplies, leading to falling wages and rising profits. The second, per Smith, said if capital accumulated faster than population grew then real wages would rise. Third, echoing David Ricardo, should capital accumulate and population increase at the same rate, yet technology stay stable, there would be no change in real wages because supply and demand for labour would be the same. However growing populations would require more land use, increasing food production costs and therefore decreasing profits. The fourth alternative was that technology advanced faster than population and capital stock increased. The result would be a prospering economy. Mill felt the third scenario most likely, and he assumed technology advanced would have to end at some point.Pressman (2006) 45 But on the prospect of ever intensifying economic activity, Mill was more ambivalent. > \\"I confess I am not charmed with the ideal of life held out by those who > think that the normal state of human beings is that of struggling to get on; > that the trampling, crushing, elbowing, and treading on each other's heels, > which form the existing type of social life, are the most desirable lot of > human kind, or anything but the disagreeable symptoms of one of the phases > of industrial progress.Mill (1871) Book 4, Chapter 6 * I General characteristics of a Progressive State of Wealth * II Influence of the Progress of Industry and Population on Values and Prices * III Influence of the Progress of Industry and Population on Rents, Profits, and Wages * IV Of the Tendency of Profits to a Minimum * V Consequences of the Tendency of Profits to a Minimum * VI Of the Stationary State * VII On the Probable Futurity of the Labouring Classes ==Book V on the Influence of Government== * I Of the Functions of Government in General * II On the General Principles of Taxation * III Of Direct Taxes * IV Of Taxes on Commodities * V Of some other Taxes * VI Comparison between Direct and Indirect Taxation * VII Of a National Debt * VIII Of the Ordinary Functions of Government, considered as to their Economical Effects * IX The same subject continued * X Of Interferences of Government grounded on Erroneous Theories * XI Of the Grounds and Limits of the Laisser-faire or Non-Interference Principle == Reception == In 1856, this book was included in the Index Librorum Prohibitorum, thus being banned by the Catholic Church. ==See also== * Essays on Some Unsettled Questions of Political Economy (1844) John Stuart Mill ==NotesReferences== * Hollander, Samuel (1985) The Economics of John Stuart Mill, University of Toronto Press * Pressman, Steven (2006) Fifty Major Economists, Routledge, * Schwartz, Pedro (1972) The New Political Economy of J.S.

She also received the Miss Vitality Ambassador award. Cheung has said her goal is to become a successful programme host and to promote healthy living. ==Early life== Cheung was on born 18 November 1983 in British Hong Kong with family roots in Chaozhou, Guangdong. She was educated at David Thompson Secondary School and graduated from University of British Columbia and Chinese University of Hong Kong. At the 9 year old, her family moved to Vancouver, Canada. ==Pageant career== Kayi Cheung Crowned Miss Hong Kong 2007 In 2005, Cheung entered the Miss Chinese (Vancouver) Pageant in which she was not named as a Top 3 contestant. However, she captured the Miss Vivacious Beauty award. She hosted What's On on Fairchild Television until April 2007 when she returned to Hong Kong as an overseas contestant in the Miss Hong Kong Pageant. Cheung was not a favorite to win, and was not considered a contender. When she was announced as the winner, the reception by the audience and the public was very controversial. What followed was massive criticism totally unseen in Hong Kong pageant history. The media and the public severely bashed Cheung for being one of the least beautiful Miss Hong Kong winners ever. TVB, the organizer of the pageant, claimed that the onstage performance on the final night was just part of the game and Cheung had showed very strong communication skills when meeting the judges before the final, which might prove decisive. The public were not convinced, and insisted that Cheung's win was fixed. The bashing continued to the point that there were informal polls among internet fans on whether there should be a re-election of Miss Hong Kong 2007. Nevertheless, Cheung handled the pressure gracefully and remained calm and composed whenever she was asked about all the harsh comments made on her looks. Cheung competed in Sanya, China for the Miss World 2007 pageant in December 2007. In the pageant she made history by becoming the first Miss Hong Kong to win the Beauty With A Purpose award, based on her charity work for the \\"Wai Yin Association\\", a charitable organisation set up by a group of former Miss Hong Kong winners/participants since 1982. Cheung tied with Miss Ecuador, Valeska Saab for the award, so both advanced to the semifinals automatically. She is the first Miss Hong Kong to make the semi-finals since Pauline Yeung in 1987. The Miss World 2007 title went to Zhang Zilin of the People's Republic of China. In January 2008, Cheung went on to compete in the Miss Chinese International 2008 pageant where she was met again with the same criticism and was not expected to win despite being the host delegate representative. Again she broke all odds and became 1st runner up. This was again criticized as being the result of TVB's \\"help.\\" ==Filmography== Films *72 Tenants of Prosperity (2010) *I Love Hong Kong 2013 (2013) TV series {  - ! Year ! Title ! Role !

The courtyard inside Rewley House. Rewley House, located on the corner of Wellington Square and St John Street in the city of Oxford, England, is the primary base of Oxford University's Department for Continuing Education (previously the Department of External Studies). ==History== The building known as Rewley House was originally built in 1873 as a convent school, St Anne's Rewley. By 1903, the school had ceased operation, and the building stood dormant until 1927, when it was purchased by the University of Oxford as a headquarters for its adult education activities.Lawrence Goldman, Dons and Workers, Oxford and Adult Education Since 1850, Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1995. Oxford University was one of the founders of the adult education movement in the United Kingdom in the late 19th century. By the 20th century the University's outreach efforts had grown to such a level as to make a base in Oxford necessary. A report of 1919 recommended \\"the establishment of a Centre or House for Extra-Mural Students\\". The old St Anne's became Rewley House, and was the ideal base of operations ‚Äî particularly since the small hotels in Wellington Square had long been used as accommodation by the University's external students coming to Oxford for residential portions of their courses. Rewley House in the 1920s included a library, common room and lecture halls. Further expansion in the 1960s and 1980s added accommodation and dining facilities for students, in addition to more teaching classrooms and a lecture theatre. Kellogg College, the University's only college dedicated to the needs of part-time adult students, was based in Rewley House and remained there until the late 1990s, when the College moved to its own grounds nearby on Banbury Road in Oxford. The name \\"Rewley\\" is taken from Rewley Abbey, a 13th-century Cistercian monastery which stood nearby.

Officially announced on 13 July 2007, Shadows of the Sun received critical acclaim on release, and was described as \\"dark and tragic\\", with \\"soothing electronics and natural percussion\\". The album features contributions from Pamelia Kurstin on theremin, Mathias Eick on trumpet, and Austrian white noise musician Christian Fennesz adding electronics (described as \\"supplemental shimmer\\") and helping Ulver to correspond with their vision on the final product. ==History== The track listing and the album sleeve was released to the public in a press statement by Ulver's American record label The End Records, and a teaser for the song \\"Vigil\\" was released on MySpace on 29 August 2007. On 30 August Ulver announced a release party for the album to be held at the Europa Night Club in Brooklyn, New York on 20 September 2007 with Kristoffer Rygg and Tore Ylwizaker DJing, while The Austerity Program and Lapdog of Satan were playing live. On 13 September 2007 Jester Records made it possible to pre-order the album, including a limited vinyl edition, with alternate front cover by David D'Andrea. The collector's deal also included a 10\\" red vinyl edition of A Quick Fix of Melancholy. The End Records also released a special deal consisting of the CD edition of the album, a T-shirt, and a screen print by Tomi Lahdesmaki in a limited run of 200. The release of Shadows of the Sun was delayed in Europe and the United States, possibly caused by problems with the vinyl manufacturing.Jester Records sent an email to those who had ordered the \\"Standard Deal\\" or the \\"Collector's Deal\\" on October 2 with the following content: \\"Hello everyone, this is Jester. We write to inform you that a first package is on the way, with the CDs and the t-shirts. The vinyl is delayed, there has been a fuck-up at the wax plant, unfortunately. It should reach us within a couple of weeks and we will forward it to you as soon as it gets here. Also we will ship the photos along with the vinyl, to make sure that they won't be folded.

Shadows of the Sun is the first album without an appearance from H√•vard J√∏rgensen, a full-time member on Ulver's first four albums and a guest on their last two. In February 2008, the album won the Oslo Awards prize for album of the year 2007. The album was also voted best album of 2007 at the website Sonic Frontiers. In December 2014, Shadows of the Sun was released as a sheet music album by Raven Music Editions. All the songs, except for the Black Sabbath cover \\"Solitude\\", were included in the songbook. ==Background== In an interview with Music Information Centre Norway, Ulver member Tore Ylwizaker commented on the album. He said it would be downplayed and inspired by chamber music in both style and crew. Ylwizaker also took a year off to study classical composers and composition techniques, and said he took a particular liking to Igor Stravinsky's The Firebird. Rygg described Shadows of the Sun as \\"our most personal record to date.\\" Commenting in Unrestrained magazine in 2007, Rygg said, \\"I'm a diagnosed depressive, and should have been trying to focus on living, but instead I've immersed myself in some isolated, dark and paranoid place. It has no doubt helped make this album what it is, but it's a prison of the mind.\\" Adding, ‚ÄúSometimes all I see is darkness; it's overpowering. So this record is about venting out a lot of that stuff, the gloom, but it also represents some kind of quiet acceptance. Like this is how the situation is, and you're just gonna have to live with it. Use it for what it's worth.\\" On the album‚Äôs evolution, Rygg commented, \\"I was pretty set on keeping it more bare this time. When we did Blood Inside, we'd been holding back with all that minimal stuff for so long ‚Äî the soundtracks (Lyckantropen Themes and Svidd neger), the Silence EPs and all that. So Blood Inside was an outburst of sorts. I guess this record is a withdrawal again, so that's an inherent dynamic...flux and reflux.\\" Commenting on the use of the Oslo Session String Quartet, Rygg said, \\"We worked a lot with simulating stringed instruments, so it's always good for us to get some people in and play the real thing. I suppose strings and piano are our instruments of preference; those are the sounds we like to work with. That timbre, you know? In terms of writing music ‚Äî not that we really write music per se, but say we did write music, we'd write it for strings and piano.\\" Adding, \\"A lot of times when we get musicians into the studio we just get them to play along with preliminary ideas or themes. We can record hours of music and end up using one minute of it. But this time we had the body of the songs before the string quartet came, and we wrote down a part for them. It was a little more disciplined than before.\\" Rygg, commenting in Unrestrained magazine, said, \\"The first song, ‚ÄúEos,‚Äù is an embellishment of a piece that we did for a funeral theme in the movie Uno. So you can use the same source material in different contexts. If you're in a different place at a different time and in a different frame of mind you can use stuff that originally didn't go anywhere, and make something of it. So yeah, we keep everything, but, man, it's a lot of music and ideas lying on the backups these days. I'm guessing 10 per cent of what we start ends up as something presentable. We feel like a lot of things are interesting for 30 seconds or so, but then what? We could probably sell riffs to rock bands, sell hundreds of riffs or piano themes or whatever, but our main problem is to tie elements together‚Äîto 'bring it home,' as they say. We are quite selective.\\" Rygg commented in Terrorizer magazine, in 2007: ‚ÄúLyrically, the album is very simple. It's the basics - life, love, loss. And, of course, death. It's been a humbling record to make, and has kind of beaten us down. People will no doubt say that it's pretentious, but that's not how it felt when we were doing it.\\" Continuing, ‚ÄúThe lyrics are always the biggest challenge. We have these writer's nights sometimes, J√∏rn [Sv√¶ren] and I, where we go to my parents' cottage with something to drink, some music and just dedicate ourselves to writing.\\" Commenting on Ulver‚Äôs evolution, Rygg said, \\"I don't think anyone will be surprised. The shock value is gone, I think it went away with Metamorphosis. Since then, the changes haven't been fundamental at all.‚Äù Continuing, ‚ÄúI think the shapeshifting story is one that has been greatly exaggerated by the media. There have been a couple of twists and turns after the Blake record, that's granted, but nothing too significant. I see Ulver as having a part one and a part two. And that's a division that we already had in our minds before those first three albums were even finished. We already knew we were going somewhere else after Nattens madrigal. Due to logistics, we had to wait almost two years until that one got released, and in the interim we had amassed a huge array of influences. We were out of our teens and our outlook was becoming more complex.\\" \\"One of the original ideas for this album was to have no percussion whatsoever. We ended up having to use it but we limited it as much as we could. We usually have some sort of mental picture of what we're going to do and set out all sorts of guidelines for ourselves to get there. But as soon as we get working, the process takes precedence. The control room gets out of control, in a manner of speaking. We start with lots of belief in ourselves and our abilities, and end up in nothing but mistrust and dissolution.‚Äù Discussing the influence aesthetic for Shadows of the Sun and the influence of chamber music, Rygg commented, ‚ÄúThere's no specific aesthetic other than a sense of the beautiful itself, I suppose. There's a connection to classical composition, that's pretty obvious. Some Wagner transpositions. Some Schumann warped beyond recognition etc. in there. \\"Funebre\\" is largely based on one single bar off Wagner and we have that little Chopin signature thrown in there as well. So yeah, even though we use fewer notes, the classical stamp is all over the record. Beach Boys? It's probably the vocal thing, that I am fond of clean-sung, layered, well-produced vocals and harmonies. That's another rarity these days. I wonder, where did all the sunshine pop go?‚Äù In an interview with Pitchfork Media, Rygg commented on the collaboration with Christian Fennesz: ‚ÄúHe remixed a song off Perdition City. I wanted Christian to leave his signature on this album simply because I love his stuff, and he has a similar story to ours. He's not at home in his own genre. That \\"harsh\\" noise stuff does not appeal to me at all. It lacks the fingerspitzengef√ºhl that turn songs like Christian's \\"Chateau Rouge\\" or \\"A Year in a Minute\\" into something special. He makes white noise sound like sunlight dappling in the Mediterranean.‚Äù ==Critical reception== Upon release, Shadows of the Sun received generally positive reviews from music critics. William York, writing for AllMusic, commented, ‚ÄúShadows of the Sun offers a new slant on the sort of electronic art pop sound that Ulver have been developing off and on since 1999‚Äòs Metamorphosis EP. Along with 2005's return- to-form Blood Inside, it is one of their stronger efforts this decade, following several years of experimentation with instrumental electronic music. They have developed a unique, quickly identifiable sound during that time, and this album is a nice variation on that signature sound.‚Äù SputnikMusic rated the album 4 out of 5, commenting, ‚ÄúUlver have taken a decidedly more subtle approach to songwriting and the mood they‚Äôre attempting to create, but what a mood it is. The feeling that you get while listening to this album could best be summed up by the word ‚Äúserenity‚Äù. Granted, it is a somber form of serenity, but the word still fits perfectly.‚Äù Adding, ‚ÄúIf there are any problems that some may have with this new album it is going to be the same thing that is going to make others love this album, and that is its subtlety. Whereas on Blood Inside and Perdition City the albums commanded your attention due to their frequent shift from soft to loud sections and their regular use of discordant sounds, Shadows of the Sun will easily fade away from your attention if you don‚Äôt give it the awareness it deserves.‚Äù Roadrunner Records affiliate website Blabbermouth.net rated the album 8.5 out of 10, commenting, ‚ÄúShadows of the Sun begins sombrely and remains so throughout, employing more subtle coloration and impeccable placement of impacting (but still low-key) rhythms. It is the magic that Ulver creates on Shadows of the Sun that seeps through the pores and drowns the soul in melancholic grace. It is why the act stands alone.‚Äù ==Track listing Personnel == ;Ulver *Kristoffer Rygg *Tore Ylwizaker *J√∏rn H.

He made over 290 appearances in the English Football League, most notably for Brentford and Dagenham & Redbridge. Saunders began his career in non-League football and in 2007 was part of the Dagenham & Redbridge team which was promoted to the Football League for the first time in the club's history. He later made over 200 appearances for Brentford and is a member of the club's Hall of Fame. == Career ==  Early years and non-League football  Saunders began his career at Charlton Athletic and spent five years in the club's youth setup up to the age of 15. He spent a year in the academy at Fulham, but was unable to win a contract and dropped into non-League football when he signed for Southern League Premier Division club Welling United's youth team in 2000. While with Welling, Saunders returned to Fulham briefly to appear in a youth tournament in Marseilles, but was unable to win a scholarship deal. Saunders played sparingly for Welling before moving to Southern League First Division East club Ashford Town (Kent) on 7 March 2002. He moved to the Isthmian League Premier Division to join Carshalton Athletic in February 2004 and after being allocated to the newly created Conference South for the 2004‚Äì05 season, the Robins narrowly avoided relegation during Saunders' solitary full season on the club's the books.  Dagenham & Redbridge  Saunders joined Conference Premier club Dagenham & Redbridge during the 2005 off-season. Injuries disrupted the start of Saunders' first season at Dagenham, but following a starting appearance in a 2‚Äì1 league win over Tamworth on 21 January 2006, he became a regular in the first team until the end of the season. He made 29 appearances during the 2005‚Äì06 season and scored three goals as Dagenham finished in mid-table. Saunders was a virtual ever-present during the 2006‚Äì07 season, making 43 appearances and scoring three goals as Dagenham won the Conference Premier title to secure promotion to the Football League for the first time in the club's history. Saunders started each of Dagenham's first 10 games in League Two and played in the club's first ever League Cup tie on 14 August 2007, which ended in a 2‚Äì1 defeat to Luton Town. A medial ligament problem in October saw him miss over two months of the season and he endured another injury-hit spell between late January and early April 2008. He finished the 2007‚Äì08 season with 25 appearances and one goal. Saunders began the 2008‚Äì09 season in excellent form, with five goals in a seven-match spell. Beginning with an injury time equaliser in a 1‚Äì1 draw with Chesterfield on 14 March, he finished the 2008‚Äì09 season with a run of six goals in eight games, as Dagenham narrowly missed out on the League Two playoffs. His form won him the League Two Player of the Month award for April 2009. It was Saunders' final season for the Daggers, in which he made 45 appearances and scored 14 goals. During his four seasons at Victoria Road, he made 142 appearances and scored 21 goals.  Brentford   League One (2009‚Äì2012)  On 1 July 2009, Saunders and Dagenham & Redbridge teammates Danny Foster and Ben Strevens signed for League One club Brentford on free transfers, with Saunders agreeing a three-year contract. Used as a wide midfield player by manager Andy Scott, Saunders began the 2009‚Äì10 season as a starter, before falling out of favour in October and being used as an impact substitute. Despite making 30 appearances during the 2009‚Äì10 season, Saunders found himself well down the wide-midfield pecking order at the start of 2010‚Äì11 and didn't make an appearance until 18 September 2010. He requested a loan move, which was rejected by Andy Scott and he later admitted that the first few months of the 2010‚Äì11 season were the most difficult of his career. After Andy Scott was sacked in February 2011, teammate Nicky Forster was given the manager's job until the end of the season and immediately reinstated Saunders to the starting line-up. Saunders scored Brentford's first goal in their 2‚Äì1 Football League Trophy semi-final second leg win over Exeter City on 7 February, which sent the Bees to the 2011 Football League Trophy Final at Wembley Stadium. He started in the final, but came away empty-handed as Brentford lost 1‚Äì0 to Carlisle United. Saunders made 27 appearances during the 2010‚Äì11 season and scored three goals. Under new manager Uwe R√∂sler for the 2011‚Äì12 season, Saunders went on a goalscoring run in September and October 2011, scoring four goals in six games and helping Brentford to a winning position in each game. He came into form again in January 2012, scoring three goals in five games. Saunders signed a one-year contract extension in late February 2012. He finished the 2011‚Äì12 season with 43 appearances, a seasonal-best 12 goals and he was also credited with 9 assists.  Challenging for promotion (2012‚Äì2014)  Saunders began the 2012‚Äì13 season as a first-choice at the top of a midfield diamond formation, but he was dropped to the bench in mid- September 2012 and was utilised predominantly as a substitute for the remainder of the season. Saunders appeared in each of Brentford's three end- of-season playoff games as a substitute, but he was unable to help the Bees to victory in the 2013 League One play-off Final. He made 44 appearances and scored three goals during the 2012‚Äì13 season and signed a new two-year contract in June 2013. Saunders began the 2013‚Äì14 season with starting roles in cup games and substitute cameos in the league. An illness suffered by George Saville brought Saunders into the game as a first-half substitute against Preston North End on 21 December and late in the second half he capped a fine Brentford performance by scoring the third goal in a 3‚Äì0 victory. He went on to score in four consecutive games and his form won him the December 2013 League One Player of the Month award. Saunders was sidelined with a knee problem in mid-January 2014, which required season-ending surgery in February. In his absence, Brentford went on to win automatic promotion to secure a place in the Championship for the 2014‚Äì15 season. He led the team in assists during the season, with seven.  Championship (2014‚Äì2017)  Saunders travelled with the Brentford squad to the IMG Academy in Florida in July 2014 for a pre- season training camp and reported that his injured knee was \\"fine\\". The knee subsequently became inflamed and he failed to return to full training until 14 October 2014. Saunders made his first competitive appearance in 11 months with a late cameo in a 3‚Äì2 victory over Millwall on 8 November. He failed to appear again until Boxing Day, but made his presence felt, when he scored two late goals after coming on for Alan Judge during the second half of a 4‚Äì2 defeat to Ipswich Town. Saunders signed a one-year contract extension on 15 January 2015. He finished 2014‚Äì15 with just six appearances and spent the final three months of the season away on loan. A hamstring injury suffered while on loan in May 2015 prevented Saunders from playing at all in Brentford's 2015‚Äì16 pre- season and he returned to full training in early August 2015. He made his first appearance of the season as a late substitute for Konstantin Kerschbaumer in a 3‚Äì1 defeat to Reading on 29 August, but was ruled out again after the match for a period of further rehabilitation. He returned to fitness in November and made frequent second-half substitute appearances under interim heach coach Lee Carsley and his replacement Dean Smith. He scored his first goal of the season in a 1‚Äì1 draw with Leeds United on 26 January 2016 and he signed a new one-year contract 10 days later. but lost his starting place to Konstantin Kerschbaumer later in the month. He regained it in March and scored goals in wins versus Ipswich Town and West London rivals Fulham in April. Saunders finished the 2015‚Äì16 season with 25 appearances and three goals. After 67 minutes of a league match versus Ipswich Town on 13 August 2016, Saunders came on as a substitute for Maxime Colin to make his 200th appearance for Brentford. By mid-January 2017 and having failed to make an appearance for nearly three months, co-director of football Rasmus Ankersen revealed that the club were open to offers for Saunders and he departed Griffin Park on 20 January 2017. During seven-and-a-half years with Brentford, Saunders made 206 appearances and scored 30 goals. He was inducted into the Brentford Hall of Fame in May 2017.  Wycombe Wanderers (loan and permanent transfer)  On 27 February 2015, Saunders joined League Two club Wycombe Wanderers on a one- month loan. After five starting appearances, Saunders' loan was extended until the end of the 2014‚Äì15 season. He scored his first goal for the club in a 3‚Äì2 victory over Luton Town on 24 March 2015. Saunders' season ended in double heartbreak, as he was substituted with a torn calf less than a minute into the Chairboys' shoot-out defeat to Southend United in the 2015 League Two play-off Final. He made 14 appearances and scored two goals during his spell at Adams Park. Nearly two years after he initially joined Wycombe Wanderers on loan, Saunders signed an 18-month permanent contract with the club on a free transfer on 20 January 2017. He made 18 appearances during the remainder of the 2016‚Äì17 season and scored the first goal of his second spell with the club with the opener in a 2‚Äì0 victory over Barnet on 17 April 2017. Despite missing three of the final months of the 2017‚Äì18 season with injury, Saunders made 27 appearances and two goals during a successful campaign, which ended with automatic promotion to League One after a third-place finish. He signed a new one-year contract on 3 May 2018, but managed just eight appearances before his contract was terminated by mutual consent on 30 January 2019. Across his two spells at Adams Park, Saunders made 67 appearances and scored six goals.  Colchester United  On 30 March 2019, Saunders joined playoff-chasing League Two club Colchester United on a free transfer, on a contract running until the end of the 2018‚Äì19 season. He made six appearances before the end of the season and after rejecting a new contract, he announced his retirement in June 2019. == Coaching career == During the second half of the 2018‚Äì19 season, Saunders spent a period coaching Brentford B. In June 2019, he took over the role as assistant coach of the team. In January 2020, it was reported that Saunders was studying for his UEFA A Licence. == Honours == Dagenham & Redbridge * Conference Premier: 2006‚Äì07 Brentford * EFL League One second- place promotion: 2013‚Äì14 Wycombe Wanderers * EFL League Two third-place promotion: 2017‚Äì18 Individual * EFL League One Player of the Month: December 2013 * EFL League Two Player of the Month: April 2009 * Brentford Hall of Fame == Personal life == Before becoming a professional footballer, Saunders worked as an electrician for the London Underground. Looking back in 2011, he remarked \\"it was a horrible job, but it was money and gave me the opportunity to go out and play. I used to start work at half 10 at night and get in at five or six in the morning. I would go training in the evening, then go straight into work again. When John Still came calling I couldn't say no, even though I had to take a pay cut to get back into football. My parents told me they would have my back, which was great, but luckily the gamble paid off. I enjoy every second of it and don't want it to stop. I appreciate the position I'm in, being able to earn a living from doing something I love\\". Saunders was invited by the Hounslow Chronicle to write a column during Brentford's 2013‚Äì14 season, which ran from August 2013 until June 2014. Saunders has undertaken occasional television work, appearing on BBC Late Kick Off in April 2014 and as a pundit for Sky Sports' Football League coverage. Saunders co-owns custom swimwear company Thomas Royall with fellow footballers Liam Ridgewell and John Terry, though the company went into voluntary liquidation in October 2019. == Career statistics == {   center;\\" + Appearances and goals by club, season and competition - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Club !rowspan=\\"2\\"Season !colspan=\\"3\\"League !colspan=\\"2\\"FA Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"League Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"Other !colspan=\\"2\\"Total - !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals -  rowspan=\\"3\\" Welling United 2000‚Äì01  rowspan=\\"2\\" Southern League Premier Division 3 2 0 0  colspan=\\"2\\" ‚Äî 0 0 3 2 - 2001‚Äì02 1 0 0 0  colspan=\\"2\\" ‚Äî 0 0 1 0 - ! colspan=\\"2\\" Total !4 !2 !0 !0 ! colspan=\\"2\\" ‚Äî !0 !0 !4 !2 - Ashford Town (Kent) 2003‚Äì04 Southern League First Division East 15 1 0 0  colspan=\\"2\\" ‚Äî 0 0 15 1 -  rowspan=\\"3\\" Carshalton Athletic 2003‚Äì04 Isthmian League Premier Division 12 3  colspan=\\"2\\" ‚Äî  colspan=\\"2\\" ‚Äî  colspan=\\"2\\" ‚Äî 12 3 - 2004‚Äì05 Conference South 36 6 0 0  colspan=\\"2\\" ‚Äî 0 0 36 6 - ! colspan=\\"2\\" Total !48!!9!!0!!0!! colspan=\\"2\\" ‚Äî !0!!0!!48!!9 -  rowspan=\\"5\\" Dagenham & Redbridge 2005‚Äì06  rowspan=\\"2\\" Conference Premier 22210 colspan=\\"2\\" ‚Äî61 appearance in EFL Trophy, 5 appearances and 1 goal in FA Trophy1293 - 2006‚Äì07 42 3 1 0 colspan=\\"2\\" ‚Äî 0 0 43 3 - 2007‚Äì08  rowspan=\\"2\\" League Two 22 0 1 0 1 0 1Appearances in EFL Trophy 1 25 1 - 2008‚Äì09 40 14 3 0 1 0 1 0 45 14 - ! colspan=\\"2\\" Total !126!!19!!6!!0!!2!!0!!8!!2!!142!!21 -  rowspan=\\"9\\" Brentford 2009‚Äì10  rowspan=\\"5\\" League One 261201010301 - 2010‚Äì11 21 2 1 0 1 0 4 1 27 3 - 2011‚Äì12 37102110314312 - 2012‚Äì13 313701053 appearances in EFL League One play-offs, 2 appearances and 1 goal in EFL Trophy1444 - 2013‚Äì14 175102020225 - 2014‚Äì15  rowspan=\\"3\\" Championship 521000 colspan=\\"2\\" ‚Äî62 - 2015‚Äì16 25 3 0 0 0 0 colspan=\\"2\\" ‚Äî 25 3 - 2016‚Äì17 8 0  colspan=\\"2\\" ‚Äî 1 0  colspan=\\"2\\" ‚Äî 9 0 - ! colspan=\\"2\\" Total !170!!26!!15!!1!!6!!0!!15!!3!!206!!30 - Wycombe Wanderers (loan) 2014‚Äì15 League Two 112 colspan=\\"2\\" ‚Äî colspan=\\"2\\" ‚Äî3Appearances in EFL League Two play-offs0142 -  rowspan=\\"4\\" Wycombe Wanderers 2016‚Äì17  rowspan=\\"2\\" League Two 17 1 1 0  colspan=\\"2\\" ‚Äî  colspan=\\"2\\" ‚Äî 18 1 - 2017‚Äì18 22 1 3 1 0 0 2 0 27 2 - 2018‚Äì19 League One 4 0 0 0 2 1 2 0 8 1 - ! colspan=\\"2\\" Wycombe Wanderers total !54 !4 !4 !1 !2 !1 !7 !0 !67 !6 - Colchester United 2018‚Äì19 League Two 6 0  colspan=\\"2\\" ‚Äî  colspan=\\"2\\" ‚Äî  colspan=\\"2\\" ‚Äî 6 0 - ! colspan=\\"3\\" Career total !423!!61!!25!!2!!10!!1!!30!!5!!488!!69 } == References  External links == * *Sam Saunders at brentfordfc.com Category:1983 births Category:Living people Category:Footballers from Erith Category:English footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:Charlton Athletic F.C. players Category:Fulham F.C. players Category:Welling United F.C. players Category:Ashford United F.C. players Category:Carshalton Athletic F.C. players Category:Dagenham & Redbridge F.C. players Category:Brentford F.C. players Category:Wycombe Wanderers F.C. players Category:Southern Football League players Category:Isthmian League players Category:National League (English football) players Category:English Football League players Category:Colchester United F.C. players Category:Brentford F.C. non-playing staff ","title":"Sam Saunders (footballer)"},{"id":"12366374","text":"\\"Sono Mirai wa Ima\\" is a song and single by The Pillows.

WoRMS (2010). Tonna Brunnich, 1771. In: Bouchet, P.; Gofas, S.; Rosenberg, G. (2010) World Marine Mollusca database. Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=138557 on 2011-02-23 ==Description== The thin shell is ventricose, inflated, generally globular, rarely oblong and encircled with ribs. The spire is short. The outer lip is crenulated and sometimes denticulated throughout its whole length. The oblong aperture is very large and emarginated inferiorly. The columella is channeled. There is no operculum. The animal is very large, so as scarcely to be contained within its shell. The head is broad, swollen before, supporting two long, slender, obtuse, distant tentacles, dilated towards the base, where the eyes are situated. The mouth is large, muscular, strong and retractile. The respiratory tube is pretty stout. Its cavity is capacious, entirely open, provided with two branchiae placed on the left side, the larger of which, describes a pretty large semicircle. The trunk is cylindrical, very much developed, flexible, capable of being turned in every direction at the will of the animal, and of elongating itself in a remarkable manner. It is furnished internally with several rows of hooks. The foot is ovate, large, fleshy, bordering all parts of the shell. It is rounded, widened, lobed and dilated before, with a horizontal furrow. The posterior extremity has no trace of an. operculum. The generative organ of the male is very retractile. Kiener (1840). General species and iconography of recent shells : comprising the Massena Museum, the collection of Lamarck, the collection of the Museum of Natural History, and the recent discoveries of travellers; Boston :W.D. Ticknor,1837 (described as 'Dolium) Anterior view of a live Tonna galea held in a human hand The genus Tonna comprehends a small number of species, some of which attain so remarkable a growth, that they are sometimes as large as a man's head. In fact the general appearance of the shell, of an inflated, thick-set form, calls up the image of a tun, whence is derived its generic name. Thus, the characters which make up these species are a form more or less inflated, girdled, and very globular. The spire is much shorter than the body whorl. This causes the size of the aperture, which almost always occupies two thirds of the length of the shell. The animals of the tuns are in general strongly colored, and painted with different tints which form bands and spottings upon their entire exterior. ==Distribution== This marine species is cosmopolitan. ==Species== Species within the genus Tonna include: * Tonna alanbeui Vos, 2005 * Tonna allium (Dillwyn, 1817) * Tonna ampullacea (Philippi, 1845) * Tonna berthae Vos, 2005 * Tonna boucheti Vos, 2005 * Tonna canaliculata (Linnaeus, 1758) * Tonna chinensis Dillwyn, 1817 * Tonna cumingii (Hanley in Reeve, 1849) * Tonna deshayesii (Reeve, 1849) * Tonna dolium (Linnaeus, 1758) * Tonna dunkeri (Hanley, 1860) * Tonna galea (Linnaeus, 1758) * Tonna hawaiiensis Vos, 2007 * Tonna lischkeana (K√ºster, 1857) * Tonna luteostoma (K√ºster, 1857) * Tonna melanostoma (Jay, 1839) * Tonna morrisoni Vos, 2005 * Tonna oentoengi Vos, 2005 * Tonna pennata (M√∂rch, 1853) * Tonna perdix (Linnaeus, 1758) * Tonna poppei Vos, 2005 * Tonna rosemaryae Vos, 1999 * Tonna sulcosa (Born, 1778) * Tonna tankervillii (Hanley, 1860) * Tonna tenebrosa (Hanley, 1860) * Tonna tessellata (Lamarck, 1816) * Tonna tetracotula Hedley, 1919 * Tonna variegata (Lamarck, 1822) * Tonna zonata (Green, 1830) ;Species brought into synonymy: * Tonna cepa (R√∂ding, 1798): synonym of Tonna canaliculata (Linnaeus, 1758) * Tonna cerevisina Hedley, 1919: synonym of Tonna tankervillii (Hanley, 1860) * Tonna chinensis Hinton, 1972: synonym of Tonna alanbeui (Vos, 2005) * Tonna chinensis Zhang & Ma, 2004: synonym of Tonna boucheti (Vos, 2005) * Tonna cimingii Hinton, 1974 : synonym of Tonna poppei (Vos, 2005) * Tonna costata : synonym of Tonna allium (Dillwyn, 1817) * Tonna fasciata (Martini, 1777): synonym of Tonna sulcosa (Born, 1778) * Tonna fimbriata (G.

Flagbearers represent each of the five Valkyrie Generals, the major factions of Heroscape. Each flagbearer includes special dice that activate some of their powers and embroidered dice bag. The five flagbearers are: *Jandar is represented by a Knight named Sir Gilbert. He grants extra attack and move bonuses to squad figures. *Utgar is represented by an Orc named Ornak. Grants extra attack to Orcs that follow Utgar *Ullar is represented by an Elf named Acolarh. Protects elves that follow Ullar *Vydar is represented by a Primadon named Laglor. Grants a range enhancement to followers of Vydar *Einar is represented by a Samurai named Hatamoto Taro. Grants extra defense to followers of Einar Elite Onyx Vipers (2005) * This was a promotional squad that was only available bundled with Master Sets sold at Wal-Mart during the 2005 holiday season. The figure sculpts are identical to the Venoc Vipers, but were cast in black plastic. The squad is much stronger and costs more than double the number of points as the Venocs. Their special power, \\"Evasive 8\\", adds 8 defense onto their existing 2 defense when defending from a ranged attack, creating a nearly impenetrable 10 defense. It is also in the wave 10 expansion Vakrills Gambit. Nerak the Glacian Swog Rider (August 2005) * This was a promotional figure distributed free of charge at the 2005 Gen Con and again later on at special Toys \\"R\\" Us events. The figure sculpt is identical to the Swog Rider from the Knights & The Swog Rider expansion, but the swog is cast in grey/white plastic. The differences between Nerak and the normal Swog Rider is that one power is changed, an additional one is granted and he costs 25 more points. He is also a unique figure. he is also in expansion Vakrills gambit. Sir Hawthorne (August 2006) * This was a promotional figure distributed free of charge at the 2006 Gen Con. The figure sculpt is identical to one of the Knights of Weston, but is detailed in black armor instead of its original coloring. This figure, at the time of its release, is the only figure named after a fan of the game. Named after Jerry \\"Grungebob\\" Hawthorne, a longtime fan, former play-tester, and frequent contributor to the Heroscape community. He is included in the Wave 10 Special Collection, Valkrill's Gambit. Master Win Chiu Woo (July 2007) * This was a promotional figure distributed free of charge at the 2007 Comic-Con. The figure sculpt is identical to one of the Shaolin Monks, though repainted in the yellow and gray of the sixth general, Aquilla. A unique hero, Master Woo improves the attack, defense, and mobility of Shaolin Monk squads. Agent Skahen (August 2008) * This was a promotional figure distributed free of charge at the 2008 Gen Con. The figure sculpt is identical to one of the Nakita Agents, though repainted in a black suit and hair. Samuel Brown (November 2010) * Brown was intended to be the next promotional figure, but Heroscape was discontinued before the figure could be physically produced. The sculpt would have been identical to one of the 4th Massachusetts Line, though repainted with a brown uniform and other color changes.

It is a variation of Oh Hell and is also known as \\"Judgment\\" and ‚ÄúForecasting‚Äù in English-speaking countries.Oh Hell variations at pagat.com There are several variations of the game. The game is played in rounds, with each round having a different number of cards per hand and a different trump suit, progressing through Spades, Diamonds, Clubs and Hearts. The game's name, which means \\"raw flower\\" serves a mnemonic for the sequence in Gujurati (Kari, Chukat, Falli, Lal). The game continues for as many rounds as possible according to the number of players, i.e. for 6 players 8 rounds can be played before running out of cards. Each player is dealt the designated number of cards for the round. For bidding two conventions can be used: #Players simultaneously declare the number of tricks they will take by the number of fingers held out. #The player left of the dealer states how many tricks he will do, then the person clockwise declares and so on. The final person cannot declare the number of tricks that would complete the round, e.g. for round 5, if 4 tricks have been declared, the final person cannot declare 1 trick. If more than 5 players are playing, no player can bid zero more than 5 times in a row. If a player bids zero five times in a row, the 6th time has to be a non-zero bid. The game is played like any other trick taking game starting with the player left of the dealer. The tricks for each player are counted at the end and each player that successfully takes the exact number of tricks that he declared receives ten plus the number of tricks declared/taken. Each player that does not take the exact number of tricks gets 0 points for the round. If any player counted more than 10 hands then player will have moth 100 points. If the player bets 1 hand and gets 1 hand in the play, he will get 10 points, and if he bets zero he will still get 10 points and if he bets 2 hands he will get 20 points and so on, but if he loses to make his own bet hands he gets zero. ==References== Category:Exact bidding group Category:Indian card games ","title":"Kachufool"},{"id":"12366526","text":"Ma-Xu Weibang (; 1905‚Äì1961) was a Chinese film director active in mainland China from the 1920s to 1940s, and later in Hong Kong, perhaps best known for his work in the horror genre, the most important unarguably being The Phantom of the Opera-inspired, Song at Midnight. Ma-Xu was also known for a few acting roles early in his career, as well as for being a screenwriter. The director of 33 known films, much of Ma-Xu's early work has been lost. Ma-Xu was born Xu Weibang in 1905 in Hangzhou, Zhejiang. Little is known of this early period except that his parents died while Ma-Xu was still a child, which was said to influence his decision to incorporate his wife's surname, \\"Ma\\". ==Career in film== Ma-Xu studied at the Shanghai Institute of Fine Arts in the early 1920s. Following his graduation, he began working as an actor for the Mingxing Film Company, his first film being Zhang Shichuan's The Marriage Trap in 1924. Following a brief stint in the short-lived Langhua Film Company where he directed his first film in 1926, Ma-Xu returned to Mingxing where he began serving as assistant directors for some of the more established talent. His thriller, The Cry of Apes in a Deserted Valley is the only one of these directorial efforts to have survived. Ma-Xu's first real success, however, did not come until 1937 with Song at Midnight, often referred to as China's first horror film. Based on Gaston Leroux's classic novel The Phantom of the Opera, the film is now seen as part of the canon of early Chinese cinema, and was also remade as The Phantom Lover by Ronny Yu in 1996. Ma-Xu followed up Song with two additional horror films, Walking Corpse in an Old House (1938) and The Lonely Soul (1938). In 1941, he made a lackluster sequel to Song at Midnight (during the height of the Second Sino-Japanese War), and also co- directed with Bu Wancang the controversial Japanese propaganda film Eternity (also known as The Opium War). Like Bu, Ma-Xu suffered for his work on The Opium War after the Japanese were defeated and was eventually forced to move to Hong Kong where he continued to work in the film business until 1961, when he was killed in a road accident.Well-known chinese film director dies.

These spaces are generally called crevices. Examples of crevices are gaps and contact areas between parts, under gaskets or seals, inside cracks and seams, spaces filled with deposits and under sludge piles. ==Mechanism== The corrosion resistance of a stainless steel is dependent on the presence of an ultra-thin protective oxide film (passive film) on its surface, but it is possible under certain conditions for this oxide film to break down, for example in halide solutions or reducing acids. Areas where the oxide film can break down can also sometimes be the result of the way components are designed, for example under gaskets, in sharp re-entrant corners or associated with incomplete weld penetration or overlapping surfaces. These can all form crevices which can promote corrosion. To function as a corrosion site, a crevice has to be of sufficient width to permit entry of the corrodent, but narrow enough to ensure that the corrodent remains stagnant. Accordingly crevice corrosion usually occurs in gaps a few micrometres wide, and is not found in grooves or slots in which circulation of the corrodent is possible. This problem can often be overcome by paying attention to the design of the component, in particular to avoiding formation of crevices or at least keeping them as open as possible. Crevice corrosion is a very similar mechanism to pitting corrosion; alloys resistant to one are generally resistant to both. Crevice corrosion can be viewed as a less severe form of localized corrosion when compared with pitting. The depth of penetration and the rate of propagation in pitting corrosion are significantly greater than in crevice corrosion. Crevices can develop a local chemistry which is very different from that of the bulk fluid. For example, in boilers, concentration of non-volatile impurities may occur in crevices near heat-transfer surfaces because of the continuous water vaporization. \\"Concentration factors\\" of many millions are not uncommon for common water impurities like sodium, sulfate or chloride. The concentration process is often referred to as \\"hideout\\" (HO), whereas the opposite process, whereby the concentrations tend to even out (e.g., during shutdown) is called \\"hideout return\\" (HOR). In a neutral pH solution, the pH inside the crevice can drop to 2, a highly acidic condition that accelerates the corrosion of most metals and alloys. For a given crevice type, two factors are important in the initiation of crevice corrosion: the chemical composition of the electrolyte in the crevice and the potential drop into the crevice. Researchers had previously claimed that either one or the other of the two factors was responsible for initiating crevice corrosion, but recently it has been shown that it is a combination of the two that causes active crevice corrosion. Both the potential drop and the change in composition of the crevice electrolyte are caused by deoxygenation of the crevice and a separation of electroactive areas, with net anodic reactions occurring within the crevice and net cathodic reactions occurring exterior to the crevice (on the bold surface). The ratio of the surface areas between the cathodic and anodic region is significant. Some of the phenomena occurring within the crevice may be somewhat reminiscent of galvanic corrosion: ;galvanic corrosion: two connected metals + single environment ;crevice corrosion: one metal part + two connected environments The mechanism of crevice corrosion can be (but is not always) similar to that of pitting corrosion. However, there are sufficient differences to warrant a separate treatment. For example, in crevice corrosion, one has to consider the geometry of the crevice and the nature of the concentration process leading to the development of the differential local chemistry. The extreme and often unexpected local chemistry conditions inside the crevice need to be considered. Galvanic effects can play a role in crevice degradation. ==Mode of attack== Depending on the environment developed in the crevice and the nature of the metal, the crevice corrosion can take a form of: * pitting (i.e., formation of pits), * filiform corrosion (this type of crevice corrosion that may occur on a metallic surface underneath an organic coating), * intergranular attack, or ==Stress corrosion cracking== The Silver Bridge upon completion in 1928 The collapsed Silver Bridge, as seen from the Ohio side A common form of crevice failure occurs due to stress corrosion cracking, where a crack or cracks develop from the base of the crevice where the stress concentration is greatest. This was the root cause of the fall of the Silver Bridge in 1967 in West Virginia, where a single critical crack only about 3 mm long suddenly grew and fractured a tie bar joint. The rest of the bridge fell in less than a minute. The eyebars in the Silver Bridge were not redundant, as links were composed of only two bars each, of high strength steel (more than twice as strong as common mild steel), rather than a thick stack of thinner bars of modest material strength \\"combed\\" together as is usual for redundancy. With only two bars, the failure of one could impose excessive loading on the second, causing total failure‚Äîunlikely if more bars are used. While a low-redundancy chain can be engineered to the design requirements, the safety is completely dependent upon correct, high quality manufacturing and assembly. ==Significance== The susceptibility to crevice corrosion varies widely from one material-environment system to another. In general, crevice corrosion is of greatest concern for materials which are normally passive metals, like stainless steel or aluminum. Crevice corrosion tends to be of greatest significance to components built of highly corrosion-resistant superalloys and operating with the purest-available water chemistry. For example, steam generators in nuclear power plants degrade largely by crevice corrosion. Crevice corrosion is extremely dangerous because it is localized and can lead to component failure while the overall material loss is minimal. The initiation and progress of crevice corrosion can be difficult to detect. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Crevice Corrosion of Stainless Steels Category:Corrosion Category:Fouling ","title":"Crevice corrosion"},{"id":"12366567","text":"Canna 'Trinacria' is a tall 'Italian Group' Canna cultivar; with light green foliage, large, oval shaped, branching habit; clusters of flowers are open, sulphur-yellow with faint red spots in the throat, staminodes are large, throat pearl base; labellum is sulphur-yellow, throat pearl; stamen is sulphur-yellow, style is sulphur-yellow, petals green,Laurence C.

Listed at 5' 11\\", 187 lb., Morales batted and threw right-handed. ==Early career== Morales started playing sandlot baseball in his homeland before signing his first professional contract to play in Puerto Rico in late 1963. The San Francisco Giants signed Morales in 1963. He spent two seasons in Class-A (1964‚Äì65) and three more at Double-A (1966‚Äì68). The Oakland Athletics obtained him from the Giants in the 1968 minor league draft, and though Morales finally advanced to Triple-A, he remained with the Iowa Oaks of the American Association from 1969 to 1971. Then he played on loan to Tidewater, the Mets' Triple-A affiliate, in 1972. Finally, he reached the majors in 1973 with the Athletics, playing for them during part of the season before joining the Montreal Expos (1973‚Äì77), Minnesota Twins (1978‚Äì80), Baltimore Orioles (1981‚Äì82) and Los Angeles Dodgers (1982‚Äì84). Morales spent nine seasons in the minor leagues before turning into one of the premier pinch-hitters in major league history. One main problem held up his advance: as a catcher, he was a defensive liability, leading four different minor leagues in errors. Indeed, during his majors career, he appeared in the field in only 104 of his 733 total games, and he never collected more than 242 at-bats during a regular season. He is often referred as \\"a catcher by trade\\" (30 games), though first base was his most frequent defensive position in the majors (67) and eventually at left field (7). He played much more at DH (265 games) than at any fielding position. In 1975, Morales enjoyed his first solid season, batting .301 in 93 games with Montreal. For the first of four times, he led the majors pinch-hitters with 15 hits in 51 at-bats (.294). Then, in 1976 he posted a career-high .316 (50-for-158) as he went on to set his pinch-hit single-season record of 25, breaking the previous mark of 24 established by Dave Philley in 1961 and tied by Vic Davalillo in 1970. Morales' record stood until John Vander Wal of the Colorado Rockies had 28 in 1995. ==Later career== After Minnesota acquired Morales, he became an effective part-time designated hitter and his pinch-hitting skills remained intact. In 1978 he hit .314 for the Twins and posted an American League leading with 15 pinch-hits. Morales faded the next season (.267), then rebounded in 1980 hitting .303 with eight home runs (a career-high) as his 13 pinch-hits again led the league. Again in the National League, he appeared exclusively as a pinch-hitter with the Dodgers in 1982 and finished 9-for-30 (.300). He saw his only post-season action in 1983, going hitless in two pinch-hit at-bats as Los Angeles lost the NL Championship Series to the Philadelphia Phillies. In a 12-season career, Morales was a .287 hitter (375-for-1305) with 26 home runs and 207 RBI, including 126 runs, 68 doubles and six triples, hitting .300 five times overall. He struck out in only 13% of his plate appearances (182-for-1305), a testament to his skill as a contact hitter. Over his two decades-plus in the Puerto Rican Winter League, he collected a .290 batting average (840-for-2,901) with 84 home runs and 467 RBI. He also led the league three times in doubles and one in hits. In the 1968‚Äì69 season he hit .402 with the San Juan Senators, becoming one of 19 players to break the .400 line in the PRWL. However, his 112 at-bats did not qualify him for the batting title, as he was backing up teammate Johnny Bench. ==Later life== Following his playing career, Morales worked as a batting instructor for the Baltimore Orioles, Cleveland Indians, San Francisco Giants and Florida Marlins organizations.

Wrexham is a large town in the north-east of Wales with a long history of both heavy industry and as a market town. ==Prehistoric to Roman times== Approximately 8,000 years ago Mesolithic man ventured to what is now the Wrexham area. These people were hunter-gatherers and led a nomadic existence. They left little tangible evidence of their existence, save a number of small flint tools called microliths that have been found in the Borras area. A number of Neolithic (4300 ‚Äì 2300 BC) stone axe heads have been found in Borras, Darland and Johnstown. Two Bronze Age mounds are situated within the town at Fairy Mount, Fairy Road and Hillbury on Hillbury Road. Both of these mounds lie within the grounds of Victorian properties in the south west of the town. It is likely that construction work within this area during the early 20th century eradicated other related features. The Acton Park Hoard of skilfully made early Middle Bronze Age axe heads found in Wrexham suggests that the area was a centre of advanced and innovative metalworking. The area surrounding Wrexham is well served by several rivers, including the Clywedog, Alyn and Gwenfro, all of which are tributaries of the Dee. These rivers would have served as highways for early man. Finds within the Alyn area reveal that trade was taking place along this river with places as far away as Ireland during the Bronze Age. A number of Iron Age hillforts also exist within the surrounding area, perhaps marking a tribal boundary. These include Bryn Alyn (near Bradley), Y Gaer (near Broughton, Flintshire) and Y Gardden (near Ruabon). At the time of the Roman conquest of Britain, the area which Wrexham formed part of was held by a tribe called the Cornovii. The Cornovii held the lowland forests of Cheshire and Shropshire. Their tribal capital was at Wroxeter, near Shrewsbury. The original hill fort hillfort capital of the tribe was located on the Wrekin hill and one theory for the origins of the name 'Wrexham' is that it developed as a description of a settlement of men from the neighbourhood of the Wrekin: the 'Wrocansaetan' or 'Wreocensaetan'. In 48 A.D the Roman Legions reached Wroxeter and then proceeded to attack a tribe called the Deceangli who were based in what is now Flintshire. Around 70 ‚Äì 75 A.D the Legionary fortress of Deva was constructed (modern-day Chester) and for the next 300 years was the home of the Twentieth Legion. Evidence of Roman occupations can be found at nearby Holt, where a tile and pottery works were constructed on the banks of the River Dee and at Ffrith where the remains of buildings have been located. In recent years evidence of Roman occupation nearer the town centre was found during the construction of the Plas Coch retail park. In 1995 further construction work on the site revealed traces of Roman field boundaries, hearths, a corn drying kiln and coins from the period c. AD150 ‚Äì350. It is thought that these are the remains of a farmstead. ==Mercian conquest== The King's Mill road Wrexham formed part of the Romano- British Kingdom of Powys which emerged following the end of Roman rule in Britain and extended from the Cambrian mountains to the west to the modern west midlands region of England to the east. The dedication at Worthenbury to the 5th-century Bishop of Bangor St Deiniol suggests that this area was one of his outlying estates. Towards the end of the 6th century, English settlers were penetrating along the upper Trent and laying the foundations of the kingdom of Mercia, a Latinisation of the Old English Mierce meaning 'border people'. Possibly by the early 7th century some English had settled peacefully on surplus lands in the border region and gradually the line connecting Tarvin and Macefen along the river Gowy and Broxton Hills in Cheshire could have formed the dividing line between the British (Welsh) and the English during the 7th century. In 616 Aethelfrith of Northumbria defeated the combined forces of Gwynedd and Powys at the Battle of Chester and the royal Cynddylan dynasty of Powys was overthrown by the Mercians at the end of the 7th century. The English went on to dominate north-east Wales from the 8th to 10th centuries. During the 8th century, the royal house of Mercia displayed militaristic dominance and took advantage of the weakness of Powys to push their frontiers westwards. In 796 a battle between the Welsh and Mercians was fought at Rhuddlan and in the 8th century the Mercians established the earth boundaries of Wat's Dyke and Offa's Dyke between the Welsh kingdom of Powys and the English kingdom of Mercia. These boundaries pass just to the west of the site of Wrexham suggesting that during the 8th century the area lay within the bounds of Mercia. In the 8th century, the settlement of Wrexham was likely founded by Mercian colonists from the Midlands during this first advance. The settlement was founded on the flat ground above the meadows of the River Gwenfro which would have provided high-quality grazing for animals. The etymological origins of the name 'Wrexham' may possibly be traced back to this period as being derived from an Old English personal name, 'Wryhtel' and 'hamm' meaning water meadow or enclosure within the bend of a river i.e. Wryhtel's meadow. The district was known in English as Bromfield. Despite the establishment of Anglo-Saxon political control across the Marcher region in the 7th century, there is little evidence to support the idea of a substantial English folk movement into the region during the 7th or 8th centuries. The overall Anglo-Saxon occupation of the Wrexham area seems to have been partial for while Wrexham and a number of surrounding settlements have seemingly English names, the names of fields in the area were predominantly Welsh until the beginning of the 20th century. ==Welsh restoration and border conflict== Renewed Welsh and Viking attacks led to a contraction in English power in north Wales in the early-10th century yet English kings seem to have nominally dominated the area till the reign of Ethelred II (978‚Äì1016). The English dominance in north Wales further declined with the rise of Gruffudd ap Llewellyn who was recognised as King of Wales by Edward the Confessor in 1056 and likely took control of all the land to the west of the River Dee, including Wrexham. The Welsh remained in possession of the Wrexham area at the time of the taking of the Domesday Survey of 1086 and the settlement is therefore not mentioned in the survey. The boundary of Offa's Dyke lost its significance and between 1086 and 1277 the Wrexham areas formed part of the native Welsh lordship of Maelor. The Lords of Maelor had their seat at Dinas Bran and their lands stretched north from Dinas Bran to beyond Marford with the Dee as their eastern boundary and the uplands of Hope as their western limits. The lordship was divided into two commotes each with their Maerdrefi (chief manors) at Wrexham and Marford respectively. The Wrexham commote (cymwd) was formed of the greater part of Bromfield and became known as 'Maelor Cymraeg' ('Welsh Maelor'). Under the lordship of Maelor, Welsh law was enforced in Wrexham by Welsh officials and Welsh customs prevailed. Palmer describes the area as being 'thoroughly Cymricized' with the English inhabitants being 'either slain, expelled or absorbed'. The Welsh re- colonisation of the border region is likely to have taken place as a result of the forward policy of the Princes of Powys. The lordship remained disputed between the Welsh and English during the 12th century. The Annals of Chester state that the castle of Bromfield (the English name for Maelor) was burned by the English in 1140 and the King Henry II pipe roll of 1161 records that a castle is present at 'Wristlesham', the first recorded reference to the town. Henry II himself led his forces up the Ceiriog Valley in 1165 but was defeated by Welsh forces led by Owain Gwynedd at the Battle of Crogen. However, the Chronicle of St Werburgh's Chester records that in 1177 Earl Hugh of Chester had conquered the whole of Bromfield. Any English advance ultimately proved temporary however as the area was re-conquered by the Welsh Princes of Powys and was undisputedly in the hands of the house of Powys Fadog in the early years of the 13th century. The Princes of Powys skilfully dealt with their belligerent neighbours, Gwynedd and England, and the stability allowed Wrexham to develop as a trading town and administrative centre of the cwmwd (commote). In 1202 Madog ap Gruffydd Maelor, Lord of Dinas Br√¢n, granted to his newly founded Cistercian abbey of Valle Crucis some of his demesne lands in 'Wrechcessham'. In 1220, the earliest reference of Wrexham Parish Church is made when it is mentioned with reference to the bishop of St Asaph, who gave the monks of Valle Crucis in nearby Llangollen half of the income of the Church in Wrexham. In 1276 Madog II ap Gruffydd, Prince of Powys Fadog and Lord of Dinas Br√¢n, did homage to Edward I and his tenants were received into the king's peace. When Madoc II ap Gruffydd died in 1277 his estates were taken over by the Crown to be administered by the king in trust for the prince's two infant sons. In 1281 the two boys went missing and are traditionally speculated to have been drowned under the orders of the Norman John de Warenne, Earl of Surrey, who was a leading supporter in Edward I's Welsh campaigns. In 1282 Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, Prince of Wales was killed, Wales lost its independence and John de Warenne was granted the lordships of Bromfield (Maelor) and Yale (derived from the neighbouring cantref of I√¢l) by King Edward I in 1282. The tensions of this period are revealed by the suggestion that in 1282 the men of Bromfield needed the King's protection if they were to pass without molestation to and from the markets of Chester and Oswestry and Edward I himself is reported to have briefly stayed at Wrexham during his expedition to suppress the revolt of Madoc Ap Llewellyn in 1294. ==Later Middle Ages== From 1327 onwards, the town is referred to as a villa mercatoria (market town) and by 1391 Wrexham was wealthy enough for a bard, jester, juggler, dancer and goldsmith to earn their living there. The traditional pattern of Welsh life remained undisturbed, and until the close of the Middle Ages the pattern was for English incomers to be rapidly assimilated into Wrexham's Welsh society, for instance adopting Welsh patronymics. At the beginning of the 15th century, the local gentry and peasants backed the rebellion led by Owain Glynd≈µr which proved economically disastrous for the town. Local poet Glyn Guto'r Glyn (c. 1412 ‚Äì c. 1493) wrote of Sion ap Madog, the great-nephew of Owain Glynd≈µr, as Alecsander i Wrecsam (an Alexander for Wrexham). In the mid-15th century, the parish church was gutted by fire. The main part of the current church was built in the late 15th and early 16th centuries. ==16th to 17th centuries== The Acts of Union passed during the reign of Henry VIII brought the lordship into the full system of English administration and law. It became part of the new shire of Denbighshire in 1536. The economic character remained predominantly agricultural into the 17th century but there were workshops of weavers, smiths, nailers as well as dye houses. A grammar school was established in 1603 by Alderman Valentine Broughton of Chester. The 1620 Norden's jury of survey of Wrexham Regis stated that four-fifths of the land-holding classes of Wrexham bore Welsh names and every field except one within the manor bore a Welsh or semi-Welsh name. During the English Civil War, Wrexham was on the side of the Royalists, as most Welsh gentry supported the King, but local landowner Sir Thomas Myddelton, owner of Chirk Castle, supported Parliament. ==18th and 19th centuries== Wrexham town centre In the 18th century, Wrexham was known for its leather industry with skinners and tanners in the town. The horns from cattle were used to make things like combs and buttons. There was also a nail-making industry in Wrexham but in the mid-18th century, Wrexham was no more than a small market town with a population of perhaps 2,000. In the late 18th century Wrexham was transformed by the coming of the industrial revolution. It began when the famous entrepreneur John Wilkinson (1728‚Äì1808) known as 'Iron Mad Wilkinson' opened Bersham Ironworks in 1762. In 1793 he opened a smelting plant at Brymbo. Wrexham gained its first newspaper in 1848. Market Hall was built in the same year. In 1849 Wrexham was described as: :\\"A market town, a parliamentary borough, the head of a Union, and a parish, chiefly in the hundred of Bromfield, county of Denbigh; 26 miles (SE by E) from Denbigh, 18 (ESE) from Ruthin, and 187¬Ω (NW) from London; ..... and containing 12,921 inhabitants, of whom 5818 are in the townships of Wrexham Abbot and Wrexham Regis, forming the town.\\"Samuel Lewis, A Topographical Dictionary of Wales, 1849 Wrexham was connected to the rest of the UK by rail in 1849 and this eventually became a large and complex network of railways, the main branch being the Wrexham and Minera Branch, which supported the steelworks at nearby Brymbo Steel Mill and the Minera Limeworks. In 1895, the Wrexham and Ellesmere Railway was completedCPAT (Retrieved 6 January 2011) and cut a swathe through the town centre. In 1863 a volunteer fire brigade was founded. Wrexham benefitted from good underground water supplies which were essential to the brewing of good beer and brewing became one of its main industries. In the middle of the 19th century, there were 19 breweries in and around the townBBC History % March 2010 (Retrieved 6 January 2011) Several of these were comparatively large breweries, together with many smaller breweries situated at local inns. Some of the more famous old breweries were the Albion, Cambrian, Eagle, Island Green, Nag's Head (Soames) and Willow. However, the most famous was the Wrexham Lager brewery which was built between 1881 and 1882 in Central Road. This was the first brewery to be built in the United Kingdom to produce lager beer. Another major producer, Border Breweries, was formed in 1931 by a merger of Soames, Island Green, and the Oswestry firm of Dorsett Owen. Wrexham is on the edge of the rich Ruabon area marl bedsPenmorfa.com Retrieved 2011-0106) and several brickworks sprang up in the area, among these, the most well known was Wrexham Brick and Tile and Davies Brothers in Abenbury, on the outskirts of Wrexham. Coal mining was an important industry in the area, and provided employment for large numbers of Wrexham people, however, most of the mines were situated well outside of the town. Wrexham's coalfield was part of the larger North East Wales field. A number of deep mines were constructed throughout the area including Llay, Gresford, Bersham and Johnstown. A number of new settlements were built on the edge of the town to accommodate miners at a number of the sites including Llay and Pandy (for Gresford). Other forms of mining and quarrying have taken place around Wrexham throughout its history, these include lead extracted from Minera. ==20th and 21st centuries== Location of Wrexham within Wales In the latter half of the 20th century, Wrexham began a period of depression: the many coal mines closed first, followed by the brickworks and other industries, and finally the steelworks (which had its own railway branch up until closure) in the 1980s. Wrexham faced an economic crisis. Many residents were anxious to sell their homes and move to areas with better employment prospects, however buyers were uninterested in an area where there was little prospect of employment. Many home-owners were caught in a negative equity trap. Wrexham was suffering from the same problems as much of Industrialised Britain and saw little investment in the 1970s. In the 1980s and 1990s, the Welsh Development Agency (WDA) intervened to improve Wrexham's situation: it funded a major dual carriageway called the A483 bypassing Wrexham town centre and connecting it with Chester and Shrewsbury, which in turn had connections with other big cities such as Manchester and Liverpool. It also funded shops and reclaimed areas environmentally damaged by the coal industry. The town centre was regenerated and attracted a growing number of high street chain stores. However, the biggest breakthrough was the Wrexham Industrial Estate, previously used in the Second World War, which became home to many manufacturing businesses including Kellogg's, JCB, Duracell and Pirelli. It is now the fifth-largest industrial estate in Europe (second in the UK) by area with over 250 businesses. There are also a number of other large industrial estates in the Wrexham area, with companies such as Sharp, Brother, Cadbury, and Flexsys. On 21 November 2012, Brother made the last British typewriter at its Wrexham factory. Economy In November 2006 unemployment in Wrexham stood at 1.9%. This was below the averages for Wales of 2.3%, and England and the UK of 2.5%. Caia Park riot In June 2003, a large disturbance took place in the Caia Park estate, which has become known as The Caia Park Riots. Tension developed between Iraqi Kurd refugees and local residents centred on one of the estate's pubs (The Red Dragon, Wrexham), which gradually escalated and resulted in petrol bombs and other missiles being hurled at police trying to restore order. 51 people appeared in court, of whom eight, all long-term residents, received custodial sentences of up to two years. Developments and regeneration Recent years have seen a large amount of redevelopment in Wrexham's town centre. The creation and re-development of civic and public areas such as Queens Square, Belle Vue Park and Llwyn Isaf have improved the area dramatically. New shopping areas have been created at Henblas Square, Island Green and Eagles Meadow. Bid for city status Wrexham is the largest settlement in North Wales and has applied for city status several times. In 2002 it applied as part of the celebrations for the Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II. Other Welsh applicants were Aberystwyth, Machynlleth, Newtown, Newport and St Asaph, and city status was awarded to Newport. Wrexham applied again, most recently, in 2012 as part of the Diamond Jubilee but lost out to St Asaph. == Historic hotels, inns and public houses == Wynnstay Arms Hotel  Wynnstay Arms Hotel  The Wynnstay Arms Hotel on Yorke Street was built in the eighteenth century. Its name refers to Wynnstay, a country house in Ruabon. The Football Association of Wales was founded at a meeting in the hotel on 2 February 1876.  Elephant and Castle  The Elephant and Castle, Charles Street was a public house. It was known to have existed in 1788, and closed in 1999. On 13 June 1863, George Smith (also known as William Smith), who was lodging at the Elephant and Castle, committed suicide by cutting his throat. George Smith was the father of Annie Chapman, the second canonical victim of Jack the Ripper. alt=Feathers Inn, Chester Street, Wrexham  Feathers Inn  The Feathers Inn, Chester Street was a coaching inn. It was established in the late 18th century as the Plume of Feathers. It closed in the late 1990s and is now used as a shop. The original inn was demolished or rebuilt in about 1850‚Äì1860. The adjoining property number 62 Chester Street was incorporated into the inn. It is a two-storey rendered brick building with brick coach houses and stables at the rear. It was grade II listed on 31 January 1994.  Turf Hotel  The Turf Hotel, Mold Road (also known as the Turf Tavern) was established in the 1840s. It was the only pub in the United Kingdom to be built inside the grounds of a football club. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Wrexham on Vision of Britain *Wrexham Council history of Wrexham *Welsh Coal Mines ‚Äì ALL the Welsh pits including all the local ones Category:Wrexham Wrexham Wrexham Wrexham Category:The Lordship of Bromfield and Yale ","title":"History of Wrexham"},{"id":"12366619","text":"Rabbi Moshe Chaim Ephraim of Sudilkov was born in Medzhybizh, Poland 1748 and died there on the 17th of Iyar in 1800.

Afterwards, he settled in Sudilkov (near Shepetivka) in 1780 where he served as Maggid until 1785. In 1785, he returned to Medzhybizh and served as rebbe there until 1800 when he died. He is buried next to his grandfather, the Baal Shem Tov. In many ways, Moshe Chaim was the exact opposite of his brother, R. Boruch of Medzhybizh. Moshe Chaim was quiet, studious and reflective, and who lived his life in utter poverty. His work Degel Machaneh Ephraim was published by his son Yaakov Yechiel in 1810 in Korets. A classic of Chasidic literature, it contains discussions about each of the weekly Torah portions based upon the teachings of the Baal Shem Tov and his other teachers. It also contains a recording of his dreams from 1780 to 1786. The work is considered a primary source in the understanding of the ideology of the Baal Shem Tov. ==References== *Rabinowicz, Tzvi M.

Within her family she was called Feo. Her father having been largely disinherited at the time of his marriage, he initially adopted his wife's morganatic comital title. The family were taken in by the Queen and given grace and favour accommodations at St James's Palace. Her brother, Lord Edward Gleichen, became a career military officer and author. Her sister, Lady Helena Gleichen, became a portrait painter. On 15 December 1885, the Court Circular announced the Queen's permission for Feodora's mother to share her father's rank at the Court of St James, and henceforth they were known as TSH Prince and Princess Victor of Hohenlohe-Langenburg. But the Queen did not extend that privilege to their four children, although she confirmed use of their German style as count and countesses. In 1889 Feodora and her sisters Valda and Helena were bridesmaids to the Princess Royal Louise and the Earl of Fife. On 12 June 1913 Feodora and her sisters were granted precedence before the daughters of dukes in the peerage of England by George V. ==Education== Gleichen studied art in her father's studio at St James's and later with Alphonse Legros at the Slade School of Art. While maintaining her father's studio she associated with leading artists such as Sir George Frampton, sculptor of the statue of Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens. She completed her studies in Rome in 1891 and regularly exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1892 and at the New Dudley Gallery. ==Career== Florence Nightingale - geograph.org.uk - 716771 After her father's death in 1891, she took over his studio inside of St James's Palace. Gleichen was a multidisciplinary artist, creating large sculptures for public venues as well as smaller objects, portrait busts, drawings, small bronzes and bas reliefs. She produced many decorative objects such as frames, chalices and small sculptures, sometimes for the use of the royal family. A bas-relief and hand-mirror in jade and bronze won her a bronze medal in 1900 at the Exposition Universelle in Paris. She also helped with illustrations for the Younghusband Expedition to Tibet in 1904. ==Major works== Diana Fountain, Hyde Park, London *Statue of Queen Victoria surrounded by children, Royal Victoria Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada, 1895. *1906 bronze statue of Diana, Rotten Row, Hyde Park, United Kingdom. *Relief, Art Gallery of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia, 1906. *King Edward VII memorial, King Edward VII Hospital, Windsor, United Kingdom, 1912. *Statue of Florence Nightingale, Derbyshire Royal Infirmary, 1914. *37th (British) division memorial, Monchy-le-Preux, France, 1921. ==Permanent collections== Her 1921 work Head of a Girl is included in the permanent collection of the Tate Gallery.

In July 2008 Scott joined AFC Fylde on a Free Transfer from Farsley Celtic. At the start of the 2009‚Äì10 season he joined up with his twin brother David at Hyde. Scott made his debut against Stafford Rangers which Scott's Hyde won 1‚Äì0. On 17 October 2010, he scored his first goal for Hyde in a 3‚Äì1 defeat to Corby Town. He scored once more that season in a 4‚Äì3 defeat to the hands of Blyth Spatrans. He finished the 2009‚Äì2010 season with Hyde having played 42 games in all competitions scoring 2 goals. On 3 October 2010, McNiven was made assistant manager to Neil Tolson at Hyde following the departure of former assistant manager Glynn Hurst to FC United of Manchester. He took over as joint player-manager with Steve Halford after the sacking of Neil Tolson on 4 April 2011. He was replaced as the joint-manager of Hyde before the start of the 2011‚Äì12 season by Gary Lowe. In May 2012, he was appointed as full-time manager when Gary Lowe resigned after just a year with the club. He was relieved of his duties on 2 January 2015 following a 7‚Äì1 defeat to Stalybridge Celtic. ==Personal life== His father and twin brother, both named David, were also footballers. In 2007 whilst he was at Mansfield Town he was diagnosed with testicular cancer, but made a full recovery. After his time with cancer, he went out to help others with the same illness. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:1978 births Category:Living people Category:Footballers from Leeds Category:People from Lytham St Annes Category:Scottish footballers Category:Scotland under-21 international footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:Oldham Athletic A.F.C. players Category:Oxford United F.C. players Category:Mansfield Town F.C. players Category:Chester City F.C. players Category:Morecambe F.C. players Category:Guiseley A.F.C. players Category:Fleetwood Town F.C. players Category:Farsley Celtic A.F.C. players Category:A.F.C.

It was originally released under the Starcade labelhttp://www.page6.org/archive/issue_07/page_14.htm and was reissued in 1985 when Argus acquired the Bug-Byte budget label. ==Overview== The game is set in a pond with the player taking the role of a tadpole.https://www.retrogamer.net/retro_games80/savage-pond/ The aim of the game is to build up a colony of frogs while avoiding the many hazards. The setting and characters are all quite true to life which was quite unique at the time. Most contemporary arcade games, even if not set in space, such as Frogger (with frogs that can't swim) and Centipede (which is basically a space shoot 'em up with characters that look like insects), were far from realistic. The instructions include descriptions of all the 'cast' including their Latin nameshttp://www.page6.org/archive/issue_07/page_14.htm and information not relevant to the game itself. Although it may appear to be an educational game it is actually a fast-paced arcade game. ==Gameplay== The game begins with Colony 1, which is a simple, peaceful pond. The tadpole character can swim around the pond eating amoeba. The only hazard in the pond are the hydra clinging to the bottom of the pond that will sting and kill the tadpole if they touch. There is also a dragonfly that occasionally flies over the pond and drops an egg. The egg can be eaten but if left to hatch, the larva will escape (but again can be eaten) and return as a nymph which will chase the tadpole until it catches and eats it or becomes exhausted and chrysalises to become another dragonfly. In order to build the frog colony, many 'evolutions' must take place, most of which increase the number of hazards. Blood worms regularly fall into the water and must be collected. After five worms are eaten, a beetle larva appears. If this is eaten quickly, the pond 'evolves'. In Colony 1 this means the introduction of jellyfish (similar to the hydra but stay at the top of the pond), the dumping of radioactive waste (which leaves the sides and bed of the pond deadly) and finally a move to Colony 2. This begins with the same hazards as Colony 1 but with a more complicated pond with an underwater cave area which makes swimming about more difficult. The pond continues to 'evolve', first with the appearance of your first frog. This sits on a log and can be used to eat the passing dragonflies. It also acts as an extra life as if all three tadpoles are lost, the frog will reproduce before leaving with its mate for a different colony. You must create another frog before the pond can continue to 'evolve'. Further 'evolutions' include the water spider (which can trap the tadpole with its web line) and water fleas which can eat your spawn (spare lives). Colony 3 adds bumble bees which have apparently been affected by the radiation so attack your frog (in the only real exception to the true to life use of the rest of the creatures in the game). You can now build up a colony of frogs. ==Screenshots== Image:Savage Pond c64.gifC64 - A quiet pond in Colony 1 Image:Savage pond atari.gifAtari 16k - A slightly busier pond in Colony 1 Image:SavagePond Electron.JPGElectron - A busy pond in Colony 2 ==References== Category:Atari 8-bit family games Category:BBC Micro and Acorn Electron games Category:Commodore 64 games Category:Biological simulation video games Category:1983 video games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Single-player video games ","title":"Savage Pond"},{"id":"12366840","text":"Tassajara may refer to: * Tassajara, California, in Contra Costa County * Tassajara Formation * Tassajara Hot Springs * Tassajara Hot Springs, California * Tassajara Zen Mountain Center * Tassajara - mountain bike design by Gary Fisher * Tassajara Cellars - winery in Paso Robles, California * Tassajara Creek (Arroyo Seco River) - tributary of the Arroyo Seco River (Monterey County), in the Ventana Wilderness * Tassajara Creek - creek in the Morgan Territory Regional Preserve in Alameda County, California * Tassajara Mountain or Mount Tassajara - peak in the Santa Lucia Mountains *Tassajara- famous vegetarian restaurant ","title":"Tassajara"},{"id":"12366847","text":"Sutton-at-Hone is a village in the civil parish of Sutton-at-Hone and Hawley in the Borough of Dartford in Kent, England.

A commandery of the Knights Hospitallers of the Order of Saint John of Jerusalem was established in Sutton-at-Hone in 1199, and is now the National Trust property St John's Jerusalem. The property is partly open to the public (on Wednesday afternoons, April‚ÄìOctober), including the 13th-century chapel of the Knights Hospitallers and a garden moated by the River Darent. The church of St John the Baptist was in existence by 1077. It was rebuilt in the 14th century, and substantially rebuilt after a fire in 1615, reputedly caused by a gun being fired at a bird. The parish of Sutton at Hone belonged to Axstane Hundred and its successor Dartford Rural District.

The weapon was designed as a modification of the United States Marine Corps Shoulder-launched Multipurpose Assault Weapon (SMAW) to fill the void in the United States Army inventory of a \\"bunker buster\\" weapon. ==Service history== Two candidates were evaluated for the US Army's BDM program. One candidate from McDonnell-Douglas (later Talley Defense Systems) which used the same warhead as the Marine Corps SMAW, but with a rocket motor with a shorter burn time, and another developed by Sweden's FFV for Alliant Techsystems (later Honeywell), which replaced the standard HEAT warhead of the AT4/M136 with the same dual purpose warhead as used by the USMC SMAW. FFV designated the bunker buster version of the AT4 as the FFV AT8. In 1996 the McDonnell-Douglas candidate was chosen. In a unique move, the US Army ordered one batch of 1,500 then a second batch of 4,500 which were placed in contingency storage for expedited issue to units in combat.Jane's Infantry Weapon's 1995‚Äì96 page 221 The SMAW-D was delivered to the Army in 1999.designation-systems.net The conferees of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 agreed that the Army's BDM and the Marine Corps' SRAW were too similar to justify separate long-term projects, and that the Army should pursue an interim BDM program. Congress limited BDM procurement to 6,000 units. CNN news footage showed US Army Rangers firing M141s at various fortified caves during the Tora Bora operations against the Afghan Taliban and al Qaeda, being mistaken by the CNN reporters for AT4/M136 projectiles.After being fired, the projectile can be seen arching towards it target, by the exhaust nozzle in the rear which is still glowing from the heat of the burn-all-the-way in the launcher. Looks like the M141 projectile has a ruby tracer in the rear of the projectile. ==Design== The SMAW-D operates on the principle of a recoilless rifle, in that the recoil created by launching the projectile is counteracted by a \\"backblast\\" of gases fired from the rear of the weapon. This makes the SMAW-D inherently dangerous, especially in confined, urban areas, as is with all weapons of this design. The M141 has two configurations: A carry mode in which the launcher is long, and a ready to fire mode in which the launcher is extended to its full length of . The warhead is the same High Explosive, Dual Purpose (HEDP) as the USMC SMAW. It is effective against masonry and concrete bunkers as well as lightly armored vehicles. The projectile is capable of penetrating up to of concrete, of brick, or of sandbags. The warhead is activated by a crush switch in its nose that is able to distinguish between hard and soft targets. On soft targets, such as sandbags, the detonation is delayed until the projectile is buried in the target, producing a devastating effect. The warhead detonates immediately on contact with hard targets. ==Operators== Map with M141 operators in blue Current operators * * ==See also== * SMAW * AT4 ==ReferencesExternal links== * SMAW-D - FAS * M141 Bunker Defeat Munition - Forecast International Category:Anti- fortification weapons Category:Rocket weapons of the United States Category:United States Army equipment ","title":"M141 Bunker Defeat Munition"},{"id":"12366865","text":"Pietro Gazzera Pietro Gazzera (11 December 1879 ‚Äì 30 June 1953) was an officer in the Italian Royal Army during World War II, as well as a prewar Italian politician.

It is a spin-off of Eternal Champions starring the assassin Shadow Yamoto, who is depicted in her design from Eternal Champions: Challenge from the Dark Side. One of the most high profile of the last wave of Genesis games, it was heavily panned by critics as having dull gameplay and poor control. ==Gameplay== The female ninja Shadow leads a group of fellow X-perts in sabotage and other various missions. All three characters have character-specific special moves with differing attributes, along with three unique torture moves, which are used to interrogate various enemies. Players are able to switch characters mid-game in order to carry out different tasks. ==Plot== The game's plot is based on an alternate timeline in which Shadow Yamoto was not killed by the Black Orchid in 1993. Instead, she formed a vigilante group. In the game, a group of terrorists took over an undersea weapons factory. Unless the United Nations give into their demands, the terrorists will detonate a thermonuclear device that will destroy Earth. Shadow and the X-Perts embark on a mission to avert the crisis. ==Reception== The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly found the concept of controlling three characters at once in real time to be exciting, but argued that any potential fun is ruined by the repetitiveness of both the action and the missions.

Greasy Gus of GamePro panned the game as well, citing \\"moronic\\" enemy AI, poor control, ugly animations, repetitive missions, and unoriginal sound effects. A reviewer for Next Generation commented that \\"as solid as the premise of X-Perts is, the execution and game design ranks among the worst in recent memory. Control of the game's characters is slow and unresponsive with most of the gameplay centered around inept hand-to-hand combat and standing at control panels while commands are being processed.\\" He further criticized the absence of abilities that players had come to take for granted, such as jumping and moving while holding a weapon. The graphics were in his assessment above average for a Genesis game, but nowhere near as good as Toy Story or Earthworm Jim 2. He gave the game one out of five stars. ==ReferencesExternal links== *X-Perts at MobyGames *X-Perts can be played for free in the browser on the Internet Archive Category:1996 video games Category:Eternal Champions Category:Sega video games Category:Sega Genesis games Category:Sega Genesis-only games Category:North America-exclusive video games Category:Video games about ninja Category:Single-player video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video game spin-offs Category:Video games featuring female protagonists Category:Video games with 2.5D graphics Category:Video games with pre-rendered 3D graphics ","title":"X-Perts"},{"id":"12366914","text":"Mark Edward Arneson (born September 9, 1949 in Iowa City, Iowa) is a former American Football linebacker who played nine seasons in the National Football League.https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/A/ArneMa20.htm His brother Jim Arneson followed him into the NFL.

He broke into the league during the Original Six with the Detroit Red Wings, where he competed as the starting goalie with Roger Crozier in 1964, seeing action in two games. Wetzel was one of only two Americans on an NHL roster during this season, and was the only American goaltender. The other American on an NHL roster for the '64-'65 season was Tommy Williams, a right winger for the Boston Bruins. In 1958, as a 20-year-old, Wetzel played in relief of John Henderson for the Whitby Dunlops against the Soviet national ice hockey team at Maple Leaf Gardens. This was the first time the Russians played in Canada, and Wetzel backstopped the Dunlops to a 7-2 victory. The Dunlops of 1958 featured Harry Sinden, Charlie Burns, and Sid Smith. At the time, Carl was the goalie for the Hamilton Tiger Cubs of the OHA and played against the Dunlops prior to the game against the Russians. Whitby‚Äôs coach, Wren Blair, took note of Carl‚Äôs play, and upon a knee injury suffered by Whitby goaltender John Henderson, coach Blair called upon the young American to represent Canada against the Russians. It was during this 1958 season with the Tiger Cubs that Carl also played in the OHA all-star game against Denis DeJordy, Chico Maki, Matt Ravlich, Pat Stapleton, and John McKenzie. However, Carl Wetzel is probably best known for starring for the United States ice hockey national team at the 1967 Ice Hockey World Championships in Vienna, where he was, despite his team's fifth-place finish, voted best goaltender of the tournament, an award earned by only four other Americans in the history of the IIHF (Don Rigazio, '55, Willard Ikola, '56, Jack McCartan, '60 and Ty Conklin, '04). He was also a member of the 1970 and 1971 US national teams, and backstopped a Calder Cup with the Rochester Americans in 1967. Wetzel finished his major league career in 1972-73 with the WHA Minnesota Fighting Saints after spending the previous season in Austria with KAC Kitzbuhel.

Initially published by Secker & Warburg in 1997. ==Plot summary== Mary (a recent graduate from University) meets Jack, Maggie and Neal at a party and learns that despite it being The UK of 1995, they yearn for the life of a Beatnik in 1960s America. Fascinated by the group (especially the handsome, if difficult Jack) she embarks on an adventure with them, finding both love and tragedy on the way. ==Characters== *Mary, a young headstrong woman, who has recently graduated from University and lives with her parents (the novel is told in first person, from her view point). *Jack, an intense and handsome young man in his early twenties who idolises Jack Kerouac and Bob Dylan, so much so he refuses to entertain anything that existed after 1966, he is the most enigmatic of the characters, as despite being the lead male of the novel, we never learn where/who he lives with, or his real name (Jack is a pseudonym borrowed from his idol) *Neal/Matthew, a gentle affectionate young man, who shares Jack's passion for The Beats, like Jack he goes by a pseudonym (in his case Neal Cassady) he loves, but is intimidated by Jack, more is known about him, and we find out he lives with his parents (though his father is never introduced, his Mother and him are very close) and his cat Koko, who he is extremely attached to. *Maggie, a slightly younger woman (estimated by Mary to be about eighteen years of age) who seems happy to go by the title of \\"Jack's Chick\\" she dislikes Mary intensely, and the pair never have any sort of friendly exchanges, but her appearance is described very explicitly; she is blonde, full figured, wears a lot of eyeliner, and generally carries off the retro \\"Beat\\" look very well. Although she seems rather acquiescent to the male characters in the book, she is openly hostile to Mary, because of Mary's attraction to Jack and her desire to infiltrate the group. *Emily (Neal's Mother) is on very close terms with her son and his friends, she shares some of their views and smokes cannabis both with and without the rest of them. She likes Mary on sight and encourages her relationship with Neal, she is also happy to follow unconventional life choices and consults the I Ching throughout the novel. *Koko/Godot, a black cat who belongs to Neal. Despite not being human, Koko is an important character in the book, she is not anthropomorphised, so we never \\"hear\\" her think or speak, but her behaviour towards the novels characters is rather communicative. She also has a pseudonym (she was originally called Godot, but was renamed by the group \\"Koko\\" after a Charlie Parker song) and her presence is important symbolically owing to her close relationship with Neal. Minor characters *Mary's Parents, supportive and kind, but not actively involved in the plot. *Lang, the uncle of a friend of the main characters Otto Lang, (who we learn was a writer who committed suicide shortly before the novel begins.) Lang is considerably older than the main characters in the book, yet is also involved with the Beat lifestyle. He enters the novel in part II, when Jack, Neal and Mary visit his house in Brighton. *Claire, a friend of Mary, who only appears briefly at the start of the novel. It is her who first introduces Mary to the group. ==Film, TV or theatrical adaptations== Beatniks is being turned into a film by Jarvis. ==FootnotesReferences== *Toby Litt's Website * Category:1997 British novels Category:Novels by Toby Litt Category:Novels set in Bedfordshire Category:Fiction set in 1995 Category:Secker & Warburg books Category:1997 debut novels ","title":"Beatniks (novel)"},{"id":"12367038","text":"James Walter Grimston, 4th Earl of Verulam (17 April 1880 ‚Äì 29 November 1949) was a British peer, electrical engineer and businessman, sometimes identified with the fringes of the intelligence service.

Prior to 2007, the school referred to itself, in English, as the National Defence College. ==History== The first army officer school in Finland, then part of Sweden, was the , which was founded by Georg Magnus Sprengtporten in 1780 and was located in Kuopio and was then relocated to Rantasalmi in 1781. Initially it was established to train officers for the Savo Brigade of the Swedish Army, but soon it began to recruit cadets from all of Finland. The school continued operation even after the Finnish War in 1809, where Finland was ceded to the Russian Empire. However, in 1818, a fire broke out in the building, and the school was moved to Hamina to become the Hamina Cadet School. The Hamina Cadet School was located in Hamina and trained officers for the Russian Empire. It was abolished on July 24, 1903 under the influence of various orders given during the first period of repression of Finland by the Russian Empire. After independence, the Finnish officer training was always divided among three schools until 1992: initial education at the Kadettikoulu (\\"Cadet School\\", abbreviated KADK, founded in 1919), General Staff Officer Training at the Sotakorkeakoulu (\\"War College\\", founded in 1924), as well as continuous training at the Taistelukoulu (\\"Battle School\\", founded in 1927). From the beginning of 1993, all of these schools were merged into the National Defence University, one of the largest colleges of higher education for officer education.

It is commonly known as both congenital atrial septal defect (ASD) and acquired mitral stenosis (MS). Congenital (at birth) atrial septal defect refers to a hole being in the septum or wall that separates the two atria; this condition is usually seen in fetuses and infants. Mitral stenosis refers to mitral valve leaflets (or valve flaps) sticking to each other making the opening for blood to pass from the atrium to the ventricles very small. With the valve being so small, blood has difficulty passing from the left atrium into the left ventricle. Septal defects that may occur with Lutembacher's syndrome include: Ostium primum atrial septal defect or ostium secundum which is more prevalent. Lutembacher's syndrome affects females more often than males. It can affect children or adults; the person can either be born with the disorder or develop it later in life. The syndrome was first described by Ren√© Lutembacher (1884‚Äì1968) of Paris in 1916. To correct Lutembacher's syndrome, surgery is often done. There are several types of surgeries depending on the cause of Lutembacher's syndrome(ASD Primium or ASD Ostium Secundum with Mitral Stenosis): # Suturing (stitching) or placing a patch of tissue (similar to skin grafting) over the hole to completely close the opening # Reconstructing of the mitral and tricuspid valve while patching any holes in the heart # Device closure of ASD (e.g. Amplatzer umbrella or CardioSEAL to seal the hole # Percutaneous transcatheter therapy # Transcatheter therapy of balloon valvuloplasty to correct MS ==Symptoms and signs== As Lutembacher's syndrome is known for ASD and MS, most of the symptoms experienced will be associated with ASD and MS. For most people, they will remain asymptomatic (experience no symptoms) but when symptoms are shown, they are due mainly to ASD and will vary depending on the size of the hole in the atria. If the patient has a large ASD, pulmonary congestion (blood or fluid buildup in the lungs) will happen later but if the patient has a small ASD, symptoms will appear early in the disorder. In general, unless the ASD and mitral stenosis causing Lutembacher's syndrome is severe, symptoms may not appear until the second and third decade of the patient's life. As many of the patients are asymptomic and symptoms may not appear until later in life, the duration or frequency of the symptoms varies. For symptoms such as palipitations, ventricular overload, heart failure, and pulmonary congenstion, these symptoms may be sudden and not that frequent as they are very severe symptoms. For symptoms such as loud mitral S1, pulmonary S2, mid-diastolic murmur, fatigue, reduced exercise tolerance, weight gain, ankle edema, and right upper quadrant pain, and ascities, these symptoms may be less frequent and severe; their duration may be only a few seconds, minutes, or even months. Major symptoms Major symptoms of Lutembacher's syndrome as a result of ASD and MS can range from heart failure to pulmonary congestion. * Right ventricular overload and Right-sided heart failure: Both are caused by a large ASD and MS (moderate to severe). * Palpitations: This is caused by blood flowing from left atrium to the right atrium causing a higher left atrial pressure and leading to mitral stenosis. Both atria will be dilated (stretched or open)leading to future atrial arrhythmias or atrial fibrillation (Riaz). * Pulmonary congestion: When blood or fluid pools within the lungs; this is usually a symptom of mitral stenosis and a small ASD. * Loud mitral S1 and wide fixed split of pulmonary S2: The loud sound of the mitral S1 and the wide fixed split of pulmonary S2 is a symptoms of mitral stenosis. The sounds often are caused by a reduced pressure gradient in the mitral area that was caused from decompression of the left atrium from the ASD and a displacement (moving from normal position) of the left ventricular lower portion of the heart to the a large right ventricle. The second heart sound (S2) split is caused by the increase right heart blood flow through the ASD causing a late closing of the pulmonary component of the S2 as well as decreased left ventricular and aortic blood flow. * III/IV mid diastolic murmur, early systolic murmur: This heart murmur is caused by an increase blood flow through the tricuspid valve due to ASD; it is heard best in the left lower sternal area or the bottom of the heart (apex). Minor symptoms * Fatigue: symptoms is caused by decreased systemic (oxygenated blood to the rest of the body)flow. When the patient suffers from MS and the blood flows from the left atrium to the right atrium causes the forward blood flow into the left ventricle to reduce leading to a reduction of systemic blood flow; this causes tiredness. * Reduced exercise tolerance: symptoms also caused by decreased systemic (oxygenated blood to the rest of the body) flow. Just as with fatigue, when the patient suffers from MS and the blood flows from the left atrium to the right atrium, the forward blood flow into the left ventricle is reduced leading to a reduction of systemic blood flow; this causes tiredness and hence a reduced exercise tolerance. * Weight gain: this is commonly found in patients with large ASD and can be a symptom of developing right-sided heart failure. As there is a chronically increased left-to-right blood flow through the atria, this will lead in the future to right-sided heart failure. * Ankle edema: This is also caused by a large ASD and has the same symptoms and causes as seen in weight gain and right upper quadrant pain. As blood flow is not happening correctly and the heart is pumping under strain, pooling of blood and fluid will happen in the ankles. * Right upper quadrant pain: Also caused by large ASD; has same symptoms and underlying causes as weight gain and ankle edema. * Ascites: Ascite is known as abnormal buildup of fluid in spaces between abdomen lining and abdominal organs. Same symptoms and causes as weight, gain, ankle edema, and right upper quadrant pain. Less common symptoms * Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, and hemoptysis (sign of pulmonary venous congestion): this symptoms are less frequent in Lutembacher's syndrome and are more associated with MS and small ASD or patients who develop reverse Lutembacher's syndrome. This symptom is caused by mitral stenosis. Related disorders * Eisenmenger syndrome * Ventricular Septal Defect * Mitral regurgitation * Ebstein disease ==Causes== Lutembacher is caused indirectly by heart damage or disorders. Lutembacher's syndrome is caused by either birth defects where the heart fails to close all holes in the walls between the atria or from an episode of rheumatic fever where damage is done to the heart valves such as the mitral valve and resultant in an opening of heart wall between atria. With Lutembacher's syndrome, a fetus or infant is usually seen to have a hole in their heart wall (interatrial) separating their right and left atria. Normally during fetal development, blood bypasses the lungs and is oxygenated from the placenta. Blood passes from the umbilical cord and flows into the left atrium through an opening called the foramen ovale; the formaen ovale is a hole between the two atria. Once a baby is born and the lungs begin to fill with air and the blood flow of the heart changes, a tissue flap (somewhat like a trap door) called the septum primium closes the foramen ovale or hole between the two atria and becomes part of the atrial wall. The failure of the hole between the two atria to close after birth leads to a disorder called ASD primium. The most common problems with an opening found in the heart with Lutembacher's syndrome is Ostium Secundum. Ostium Secundum is a hole that is found within the flap of tissue (septum primium) that will eventually close the hole between the two atria after birth. With either type of ASD, ASD will usually cause the blood flow from the right atrium to skip going to the right ventricle and instead flow to the left atrium. If mitral stenosis (the hardening of flap of tissue known as a valve which opens and closes between the left atrium and ventricle to control blood flow) is also present, blood will flow into the right atrium through the hole between the atria wall instead of flowing into the left ventricle and systemic circulation. Eventually this leads to other problems such as the right ventricle failing and a reduced blood flow to the left ventricle. In addition to the ASD, MS can either be acquired (present either from an episode of rheumatic fever or the mother has or had rheumatic fever during the pregnancy) or congenital (the child being born with the disorder). With the combination of both ASD and MS, the heart can be under severe strain as it tries to move blood throughout the heart and lungs. ==Mechanism== Atrial Septal Defect (ASD) Mitral Valve Stenosis (MS) There is no exact mechanism for Lutembacher's syndrome but instead a combination of disorders as the result of Atrial septal defect (ASD) and/or Mitral valve stenosis.It is thought ASD is caused by the failure to close the hole (foramen ovale) between the right and left atrium normally found within the heart during fetal development; the creation of a hole between the atrium may also be acquired. There are two types of ASD: Ostium secundum and ASD Primium. Atrial Septal Defect Primium The failure of the hole between the right and left atrium to close shortly after birth is the cause behind ASD primium. During fetal development blood will pass from the umbilical cord and flow into the left atrium through a hole between the two atria. Once a baby is born and the lungs begin to fill with air, the blood flow of the heart changes; a tissue flap (septum primium) normally closes the hole (foramen ovale) between the two atria and becomes part of the atrial wall. During ASD primium, after birth the hole is not completely closed allowing deoxygenated blood to flow into the left atria from the right atria. With the failure of the blood to pass from the right atrium into the right ventricle and then into the pulmonary veins, blood will not obtain any oxygen before it is leaves the heart and goes to other parts of the body. Due to the incorrect blood flow, symptoms such as fatigue (from decreased systemic blood flow), palpitations (from blood flowing from left atria to right atria), weight gain, edema, right upper chest pain (all caused from the left to right atria blood flow), and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (shortness of breath during sleep), orthopnea (difficulty in breathing while lying down), and hemoptysis or coughing up blood (all caused by small ASD that cause blood flow from left to right atria). Atrial Septal Defect Ostium secundum During the more common form of Lutembacher's syndrome, ASD Ostium secundum, a hole will form in the flap of tissue (septum primium) that should close between the two atria after birth. With the onset of a hole created in the tissue flap that closes the larger hole between the left and right atrium, blood can again flow from the right atrium to the left. Ostium secundum causes many of the same symptoms seen in ASD primium. With either type of ASD, blood will flow from the right atrium skipping the right ventricle (or very little flowing into the ventricle) and instead flow to the left atrium introducing the possibility of blood lacking oxygen to go the rest of the body. Sometimes, the direction of blood flow is largely determined by the left and right ventricle ability to squeeze (contract) and relax (compliance). Apart from congential or birth defects causing ASD, ASD is thought to be also acquired. During pecutaneous interventional procedures such as mitral valvuloplasty (a surgical process done to repair a mitral valve), 11-12% of individuals will develop ASD allowing blood to flow from the left atrium to the right. Mitral Valve Stenosis The second cause of Lutembacher's syndrome is mitral stenosis (MS). MS can be caused by birth defects, rheumatic fever, or just stress to the heart due to ASD; because MS can be caused by several things, there is no exact mechanism but many mechanisms or causes. If mitral valve stenosis is a result of birth defects during development stemming from rheumatic fever, several things may occur in the heart. Rheumatic fever causes the immune system to attack its own protein tissues leading to lesions forming on the mitral valve flaps. As the flaps heals over time, the flaps lose their filmy and floppiness resulting in solid, stiff flaps. The loss of proper flappy mitral valves makes it harder for the valves to open and allow blood to flow through. As a result of blood flow being stopped or slowed by the faulty valve, pressure begins to build in the heart. It was once thought an ASD is not already present, could form because of MS, but it is now thought the ASD is either a birth defect or acquired from surgical procedures. Overall, Lutembacher's syndrome has no certain mechanism but a combination as the result of ASD and MS. Atrial septal defect with left-to-right shunt ==Diagnosis== Lutembacher's syndrome is diagnosis primarily by physical examinations for heart sounds, electrocardiograms, chest radiogram, transthoracic or transesophageal echocardiography, color flow mapping, and Doppler imaging. Use of the various test can help to differentiate other possible conditions such as mitral regurgitation, Ebstein disease, ventricular septal defect (VSD). Physical examinations A physical examination will be done to check for abnormal heart sounds, condition of heart, blood pressure, lungs, palpitations, edema, weight gain, ascites, or any other abnormal symptoms. Blood may also be drawn to help determine the cause of fatigue, determination of ascites, other health problems that maybe closely related to cause the symptoms such as kidney, liver, immune (signs of rheumatic fever), abnormal glucose levels. Electrocardiograms Electrocardiogram (ECG) is used for determination of the location, size, direction of blood flow through the atrial hole, hemodynamic of the right ventricle (blood circulation), tricuspid valve, and functioning of left ventricle. The ECG can also be used to determine the rhythm of the heart to determine if there is an indication of sinus rhythm or atrial fibrillation. In the ECG, the p wave morphology will be study for any abnormalities. If during the ECG, the P-wave (atrial depolarization) is tall, broad, or split waves in lead II and accompanied with a deep negative force in V1, this would be considered to be abnormal; only one wave should be associated with the P-wave. Additionally, in an ECG the QRS morphology and axis will be examined for any abnormalities. If the ECG shows a right axis deviation which is abnormal or a right bundle-branch block (this would mean there was no signal going through the atrium to instruct the ventricle to contract or squeeze blood out of the ventricle). Chest radiogram A chest radiogram can be given to a patient to determine: * Pulmonary plethora: the test will help to determine if there is a left-to-right shunt meaning the blood is flowing from the left atrium to the right through a hole between the two atria. * Mild left atrial enlargement: the test will help to determine if the left atrium is enlarged due to alternate blood flows * Right ventricular enlargement: the test will help to determine if the ventricle is enlarged due to a surge of blood above normal or if the ventricle is having to work harder than normal to pump blood out of the ventricle. * Pulmonary artery enlargement: the test will help to determine if there is a large volume of blood in the pulmonary veins and arteries than normal * Mitral Valve calcification late in life: the test will help to determine if the mitral valve or flaps are becoming hardened and losing their floppiness. * pulmonary vascular congestion, marked left atrial enlargement: the test will help to determine if there is a sign of MS and small ASD and how severe both are. Transthoracic or Transesophageal echocardiography Transthoracic or Transesophageal echocardiography two dimensional images that can be made of the heart. They can be used to determine the stages of Lutembacher's syndrome. They are used to determine: * Large left atrium: the test can help to determine if the left atrium is enlarged to a large blood flow then unusually * Large right atrium and ventricle: the test will help to determine if the right atrium and ventricle are enlarged due to a greater blood flow * ASD: the test will help to determine if there is a hole between the two atria and if blood is flowing through both * Stenotic mital valve: the test will help to determine if the blood flow through the mitral valve is normal or if the mitral valve is stiff, has a reduced opening, and constricting blood flow through it. Color flow mapping and Doppler imaging A color flow and doppler imaging is used to help confirm the presence as well as evaluate the severity of ASD and MS. Chest X-ray A chest x-ray will be given to determine the size of the heart and the blood vessels supplying blood to the lungs. Cardiac catheterization Cardiac catheterization is done to confirm a diagnosis; it is not routinely done prior. It can also be used to evaluate the severity of ASD and measure the mitral valve area. To determine the presence ASD, a catheter is passed through the suspected hole between the atrium into the left atrium. ==Treatments== To treat Lutembacher's syndrome, the underlying causes of the disorder must first be treated: mitral stenosis and atrial septal defect. Lutembacher's syndrome is usually treated surgically with treatments such as: * percutaneous transcatheter therapy for MS * Device closure of ASD Percutaneous transcatheter treatment for the MS can include transcatheter therapies of such as balloon valvuloplasty. Percutaneous transcatheter therapy Percutaneous transcatheter therapy is used to repair the mitral valve and sometimes the septum. In percutaneous balloon mitral valvuloplasty, using a catheter, a ballon such as the Inoue ballon is placed into blood vessels in the groin area and the balloon guided to the heart. If a hole is not already present, a small hole may need to be inserted the atria and inserted into the mitral valve through the left atrium; the balloon is then inflated. The balloon inside the mitral valve will be inflated and deflated several times to wide the valve opening until the opening is satisfactory; the balloon will then be deflated and removed. The advantage to using percutaneous procedures instead of open-heart surgery is not needing general anesthesia, blood transfusions, and the recovery time is quicker. The drawback to this procedure is the lack of repeating and transseptal procedures if they are needed later. Also if the patient later develops a relapse of MS, surgery will need to be performed where using more evasive techniques. Additionally, if a hole is needed to be inserted into the atria to obtain access to the mitral valve, there is a risk of developing ASD secondarily. Side effects Possible side effects from this non-invasive procedure could be: * fever * Chest pain * Shortness of breath * Unusual swelling or weight gain * Swelling, bleeding, change in skin color at site of initial catheterization in groin, or pain in the groin. If any of the above symptoms occur, it is important to contact your doctor to prevent another lapse of mitral stenosis. To ensure good health, routine doctors visits, diet, weight loss, doctor-approved exercise, and use of antibiotics in dental and other procedures are recommended. Device closure To treat ASD a device closure can be used. In fact an ASD closure is often recommended for certain cases such as with a patient who has significant left-to-right shunt with a pulmonary and/or systemic flow fraction of Qp/Qs >1.5. It is best to perform this procedure/surgery between the ages of 2‚Äì4 years. The closure is done by two methods: interventionally or surgically. Interventionally This procedure is done by placing a device such as Amplatzer \\"umbrella\\", CardioSEAL similar to percutaneous transcatheter therapy. A catheter is inserted in the vessels and threaded to the heart and inserted into the ASD closing the defect. Other closure device that have been used is the GORE HELEX Septal Occluder. After the device has been inserted and covers the defect, over time tissue will grow over the implant device to make it become part of the heart. Anticoagulant medication will be given to the patient for the first six months following the surgery: aspirin, clopidogrel or warfarin (Coumadin). Surgically This procedure is done through open heart surgery (sternotomy or thoracotomy) using an ECC where the heart is stopped to allow a system of special cannulas to be placed. The hole is closed by a direct suture (sewing) if the hole is small enough or if the hole is larger, suturing (sewing) a small patch of pericardium (heart tissue or skin) or fabric to close the hole. To increase quality life following ASD procedures/surgeries, patients should have a physical exam and ECG every 3, 6, and 12 months with their cardiologist. For many patients with secundum ASD closure repair, they can return to their normal activities unless their procedure was heart catheterization which in this case they should rest for a few days. All patients should remain on blood thinner medication for at least 6 months and up to a year unless the patient had a stroke in which they would always be on blood thinners. Patients with coronary artery disease or pulmonary hypertension will take additional medicines described by their physician. For patients who had heart surgery to repair the defect or received a transcatheter closure device, they will need to take some form of antibiotics to prevent infections such as endocarditis for at least 6 months following the procedure. Success with ASD closure is very high, 96% for percutaneous procedures and 100% of ASD surgeries as found by one research group. No patient was found to have died from either interventional or surgical treatments and only 7.2% of patients who received a device and 24.0% of patients who had surgery had complications. The hospital stay for each group also varied, the surgical group was 3.4 ¬± 1.2 days and device group 1.0 ¬± 0.3 days. As seen by this study, prognosis was good and quality of life could be excellent. =Side effects= Side effects with interventional device closure have not been extensively supported as yet. Possible side effects from the ASD device closure procedure could be: * fever * Chest pain * Swelling * Swelling, bleeding, change in skin color at site of initial catheterization in groin, or pain in the groin With surgically closure, the normal risk of infection, fevers, and blood clots are among the risks. If any signs of infection such as swelling, pain, or fever are present, the patient should seek medical attention. Patients who have ASD repaired later in life are also at a higher risk of developing atrial fibrillation especially if the device is not stable. ==Recent research== Through examining the benefits of using percutaneous treatment as an alternative to surgically means to correct MS and ASD, it was found that combined percutaneous treatment (including balloon valvuloplasty for MS and Amplatzer septal occluder for closure of the ASD) has improved the patient's planimetric mitral valve area to 2.1 cm (as compared to the previous 1.5 cm), maximum diastolic gradient to 9 mmHg (compared to previous 17 mmHg), and mean diastolic gradient to 4 mmHg (as compared to previous 9 mmHg). In another study, surgeons developed a way to use percanteous therapy in difficult situations. In this study they developed a technique to use the Inoue balloon in valvuloplasty but to insert a wire into the left atrium prior to inserting the balloon. This enabled the surgeons to be more precise in treating the mitral valve and not have the balloon to slip out of place; the wire served as a guide to inserting the balloon. Other Percutaneous procedures beside balloon valvuloplasty for MS have been looked into. Percutaneous Leaflet Plication (Edge-to-Edge Leaflet Repair) is being explored as a way to increase the opening of the mitral valve by clamping down mitral leaflets. The clamps are delivered to the mitral through a catheter as with the balloon, and then clamped onto the mitral valve. Of the patients that received this treatment, 74% patients achieved surgical success, and at 1-year, 68% were saved from dying, 90% from having to have surgery or dying from the lack thereof, a 76.3% prognosis at three years. Given the many possible treatments that are to come, future research is continuing to find better methods of treating Lutembacher patients non-invasively as with percutaneous therapy. Without successfully treating Lutembacher's more serious complications can occur such as heart failure or even disorders such as Eisenmenger syndrome. ==References== Additional references * == External links == * Category:Congenital heart defects Category:Rare diseases Category:Syndromes affecting the heart ","title":"Lutembacher's syndrome"},{"id":"12367133","text":" The Friedrichshafen FF.64 was a German two-seat biplane floatplane of the 1910s produced by Flugzeugbau Friedrichshafen. ==Development and design== The FF.64 was a two-seat biplane powered by a Mercedes D.III inline piston engine.

In September 1995, Fairley murdered Lisa Marie Manderach, aged 29, and her 18-month-old daughter Devon, when the two visited the Collegeville, Pennsylvania children's clothing store in which he worked. ==Crime== On September 10, 1995, Fairley was working alone at Your Kidz & Mine, the Collegeville children's clothing store owned by his parents. Just before closing time, Lisa Marie Manderach (born September 30, 1965) and her daughter Devon (born February 4, 1994) entered the store. When Fairley realized that they were the only customers present, he locked the doors to the store. He then attempted to sexually assault Lisa Manderach. When she resisted him, he became enraged and strangled her to death. He also strangled her infant daughter. After the murder, he sexually assaulted Manderach's corpse, then went to an Electric Hellfire Club concert that he had been planning to attend that night. ==Arrest and trial== Lisa Manderach had told her husband where she was going. When she did not return home, he contacted local police, who found her car parked outside the store. A search of Your Kidz & Mine revealed stacks of pornography stained with what appeared to be blood and long black hairs consistent with Manderach's. Similar hairs were found in the store's vacuum cleaner. Also present was a large damp spot on the carpet that was later determined to be saliva. The police also noted that peepholes had been drilled into the dressing rooms. Fairley was charged on September 12, 1995 with the murders of the mother and daughter. When police questioned Fairley, he was wearing a thick coat of makeup on his face. When detectives told him to wipe it off, his face was covered with scratch marks. When they were pointed out to Fairley by authorities, he said he received them in a mosh pit while attending an Electric Hellfire Club concert, at a local club called the Asylum. When hikers discovered Devon Manderach's strangled body dumped on a hill at Valley Forge National Park, Fairley was charged with two counts of murder and one count of abusing a corpse. Fairley entered a plea bargain in which prosecutors would not seek the death penalty if he would show them the location of Lisa Manderach's body. Fairley was tried in April 1996 and convicted on two counts of first-degree murder. On July 24, 1996, Montgomery County Court judge William Carpenter handed down the maximum sentence, two consecutive life terms without chance of parole. Fairley is currently incarcerated at State Correctional Institution ‚Äì Fayette in LaBelle, Pennsylvania. ==Victims' legacy== Residents of Limerick, Pennsylvania, raised more than $250,000 over a two-year period to create the Manderach Memorial Playground in honor of Lisa and Devon Manderach; it was dedicated on September 12, 1998. ==Media== The Court TV crime documentary series Forensic Files reported on the evidence directly linking Fairley to the murders in the season 6, episode 30 \\"Shopping Spree\\", which aired December 10, 2001.

It is found in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Peru, and Suriname. Its natural habitat is tropical lowland forests. ==Description== Allobates femoralis is a small frog, the males growing to in length and the females being marginally larger. The back is dark brown or black and the limbs dark brown. The throat is black and the belly is white, variously marked with black. A pale brown dorso-lateral stripe runs from the snout to the base of the legs and an intermittent white ventro-lateral line runs from the snout to the arm and onwards to the leg. There is an orange-yellow patch behind the arm and a half-moon shaped orange patch on the outside of the thigh. A. femoralis resembles Lithodytes lineatus in general appearance, but the latter has a dorso-lateral line encircling the back, legs barred with dark and light bands of colour, and two or more orange patches on each thigh. ==Distribution and habitat== Allobates femoralis occurs in the Amazon Basin and tropical eastern South America. Its range includes Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana and Brazil, and the eastern parts of Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia. A single reported sighting in Venezuela may have referred to Ameerega picta. It is found on the forest floor, usually at elevations below 300 m (1,000 ft), but in Colombia and Ecuador occurs at altitudes of up to 1,000 m (3,300 ft). ==Biology== Allobates femoralis Allobates femoralis is a terrestrial frog species active during the day. It feeds on small insects such as beetles, crickets, roaches and ants; the juveniles largely feed on springtails. Breeding takes place between November and April, peaking in January or February. The males are territorial and court females for two or three days before a clutch of between about eight to seventeen eggs is laid in a nest among fallen leaves. The male guards the eggs, and after they have hatched, he carries the tadpoles to pools of water on his back. ==Status== The IUCN lists Allobates femoralis as being of \\"Least Concern\\". This is because it has a wide range and is common throughout much of that range, it is tolerant of some degree of modification of its habitat, its population seems to be steady and no particular threats to it have been identified. ==ReferencesFurther reading== *Pa≈°ukonis, A., et al.

Meall na Teanga is a Scottish mountain located in the Highland council area, north of Spean Bridge. == Overview == Meall na Teanga is situated on the northern side of Loch Lochy and is closely associated with the adjacent Munro of Sr√≤n a' Choire Ghairbh which lies two kilometres to the north across the Cam Bealach (\\"crooked pass\\"). The two mountains are usually ascended together.\\"The Munros\\" Page 146 (Gives details of joint ascent of both Munros). Meall na Teanga is seen prominently from the A82 road on the opposite bank of Loch Lochy, showing steep slopes which have the conifer plantations of the South Laggan Forest below the 300 metre contour. The hill just qualifies as a Munro by four metres, reaching a height of . In the original 1891 version of Munro's Tables, Meall na Teanga was listed as a subsidiary \\"Top\\" of Sr√≤n a' Choire Ghairbh. It was promoted to Munro status when the tables were updated in 1921, despite continuing doubts as to whether it had sufficient height.The Munros and Tops 1891-1997. Spreadsheet showing changes in successive editions of Munro's Tables. The hill's name translates from the Gaelic as \\"Hill of the Tongue\\". This refers to one of the hill's ridges: either the long tongue-like western ridge which curves round two fine corries, or the steep buttressing spur which rises from the loch to the summit.\\"The Magic of the Munros\\" Page 119 (Gives info on meaning of name). The hill is sometimes referred to by its informal moniker of \\"Tango\\". == Geography == Meall na Teanga is made up of a series of short ridges and one longer one and has three fine corries on its slopes. The longer western ridge runs for two kilometres before dropping down steep grassy slopes to the head of Gleann Cia-aig. It runs along the rim of two large north-facing corries. Coire Odhar Mor and Coire Odhar Beag are both steep and craggy, and their streams form the headwaters of the Abhainn Chia-aig which flows west then south around the mountain to join the River Arkaig in the Great Glen. The shorter north-east ridge goes over the lesser top of Meall Dubh (839 metres) before descending to the top of the Cam Beallach, which links it to the adjoining Munro of Sr√≤n a' Choire Ghairbh. In all, Meall na Teanga has three subsidiary tops, none of which has sufficient altitude to be regarded as Munro Tops. In addition to the already mentioned Meall Dubh, there is Meall Odhar (872 metres) which stands on the western ridge above Coire Odhar M√≤r, and Meall Coire Lochain (907 metres), 600 metres south-west of the summit above the hill's third corrie Coire Lochain which has a small lochan within it. All drainage from the mountain finds its way to Loch Lochy and then to the west coast via Loch Linnhe. == Ascents == The most popular ascent of Meall na Teanga is from the top of the Cam Beallach pass; from here an ascent of the adjacent Sr√≤n a' Choire Ghairbh can also be made. The Cam Beallach can be approached from the south from the car park at the Cia-aig waterfall on the B8005 at grid reference , however the approach from the north-east starting at Laggan Locks just off the A82 at grid reference is now more popular, now that the track to the pass through the South Laggan Forest has been cleared of logging debris by the Forestry Commission.\\"The Munros Scotlands Highest Mountains\\" Page 141 (Gives details of forest track). A more interesting ascent from the Cia-aig waterfall can be undertaken by climbing the hill's western ridge from the head of Gleann Cia-aig; this route gives the opportunity to appreciate the corries on that ridge. The summit is marked by a cairn of boulders and gives views across the Great Glen towards the Grey Corries, the Aonachs and Ben Nevis. == References == * The Munros, Scottish Mountaineering Trust, 1986, Donald Bennett (Editor) * The High Mountains of Britain and Ireland, Diadem, 1993, Irvine Butterfield, * The Magic of the Munros, David & Charles, Irvine Butterfield, * Hamish‚Äôs Mountain Walk, Baton Wicks, 1996, Hamish Brown, * The Munros, Scotland‚Äôs Highest Mountains, 2006, Cameron McNeish, * The Munro Almanac, 1991, Neil Wilson Publishing, Cameron McNeish, Footnotes Category:Munros Category:Marilyns of Scotland Category:Mountains and hills of the Northwest Highlands ","title":"Meall na Teanga"},{"id":"12367202","text":"The sanguine poison frog or Zaparo's poison frog (Allobates zaparo; in Spanish rana venenosa) is a species of frog in the family Aromobatidae.

It is endemic to Guyana and only found on the Kaieteur Plateau, in the eastern edge of them Pacaraima Mountains. Recently, it has also been found on Mount Ayanganna. This frog inhabits the tank of the giant bromeliad Brocchinia micrantha. Tadpoles live in small amounts of water trapped in the leaf axils. It is an opportunistic sit and wait predator whose diet includes small arthropods, mosquitos, and midges. Anomaloglossus beebei has been assessed as being an endangered species because its range is small (<20 km¬≤) and its habitat is slowly being lost by expanding forests. A couple of researchers have found remarkable differences in the color of the Anomaloglossus beebei, depending on whether it has been grown in captivity or in wildlife conditions. For the latter, it has been seen how a chestnut brown color with a short black dorsal line tends to be a patter between the frogs‚Äô shoulders, as well as reddish-brown forearms, and orange- red limbs. However, if the frogs were to be raised in captivity, their legs would be light brown, and no dorsal markings would be present. This change occurs mainly because of the presence of molecules that are related to phylogeny when they are kept in captivity. This is done for the most part to resolve the alpha-taxonomy of this frog, which has now become a vulnerable species. It has also been noticed sexual dimorphisms and variations within the species. For example, male Golden Rocket frogs are usually smaller and with their third finger distinctly swollen when compared to females, which are normally larger. The coloration can also be distinct. Males have a densely pigmented black throat, and an orange pigmented belly; whereas females present a yellowish pigmentation in their throats and bellies. ==References== beebei Category:Amphibians of Guyana Category:Endemic fauna of Guyana Category:Amphibians described in 1923 Category:Taxa named by Gladwyn Kingsley Noble Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Anomaloglossus beebei"},{"id":"12367267","text":"The Men's Doubles at the 2007 Pan American Games was played at the Riocentro Sports Complex, Pavilion 4B.

Following the implementation in Ireland of the dissolution of the monasteries in 1542, it was acquired by the Kingsland branch of the Barnewall family, who later acquired the title Viscount Barnewall. Its only remains are part of a residence built upon the site. The Carmelities returned to Knocktopher in 1735, where they remain to this day. Following the Norman invasion of Ireland, the Barony of Knocktopher was created. The first baron was said to be Griffin FitzWilliam, brother of Raymond le Gros known as Raymond FitzGerald. Gilbert fitz Griffin is cited as the 2nd Baron of Knocktopher and first owner of Knocktopher Manor. He died about 1203/4. By the 15th century the family of \\"Walsh of the Mountain\\" held half of the land in this barony. The lands are believed to have included the castles at Ballyhale, Ballynacooly, Ballynoony, Castlebanny, Castlegannon, Castlemorris, Clonassy, Cloone, Derrynahinch, Earlsrath, Inchacarran, Knockmoylan, Lismateige, and Manselscourt as well as civil parishes of Killahy, Kilbeacon, Listerlin, Rossinan, Muckalee, Aghaviller and Kilkeasy. Their lands were said to confiscated by Oliver Cromwell, c.1640, by which time the Walsh families owned much of the southern Knocktopher lands. Most of the remainder of the Barony was then owned by the Earl Of Ormond. In the census of 1659 the total number of Irish in the Barony of Knocktopher was recorded as 1301. Knocktopher Abbey was established by the Normans in 13th Century and was subsequently acquired with its lands by the Langrishe family. Today is a time-share resort. ==The Langrishes of Knocktopher== The Langrishes of Knocktopher were probably its most famous residents, their influence and impact lasting through the generations to the present day. The Langrishe's seat for nearly 300 years, until 1981, was Knocktopher Abbey. We are indebted to the permission of Art Kavanagh for these detailed references in the chapter of his book, ‚ÄòLangrishe of Knocktopher‚Äô, in a book entitled Kilkenny: The Landed Gentry & Aristocracy (pub 2004). It is believed that John Langrishe (1660-1735) was the first to arrive in Knocktopher. After his first wife, Sarah Sanford, died in 1684 he then married Hon. Alice Blaney, daughter of Harry the 2nd Lord Blaney and widow of Thomas Sandford. Alice inherited the lands at Knocktopher when Thomas died in 1679. After Alice died, John became owner of those lands and married for a third time in 1695, to Mary Grace, with whom he had a child. According to Willian Nolan and Kevin Phelan‚Äôs book entitled Kilkenny: History and Society (1990), Robert Langrishe completed the outright purchase of the fee simple of their Knocktopher lands of over 800 acres in 1757, lands that had previously been held by them on a lease of lives renewable since 1698. Although John was married five times he had only one child, a son Robert (1706-1770), who succeeded John when he died in 1735. Robert was married twice, and he had one surviving son, Hercules (Herky, 1731-1811). Five of the eight Langrishe Baronets were named Hercules, and the current heir to the 9th Baronet title is also called Hercules (born 1988). Hercules was MP for Knocktopher for 40 years from 1761 until Act of Union 1800. It is claimed that he achieved that remarkable feat of that time by buying up Knocktopher property and leasing it to Catholic residents. Hercules held posts of Commissioner of Revenue from 1774 to 1801 and of Excise from 1780 to 1801. He was honoured by being created a Baronet in 1777, thus becoming the 1st Langrishe Baronet, and was appointed privy councillor in 1786. He is, arguably, best remembered for his pro Catholic Relief stance and his exchanges with friend, Edmund Burke , on the issue. Sir Hercules introduced the landmark Catholic Relief Bill 1792. He seconded the 2nd Bill in 1793 which was passed as the Catholic Enfranchisement Act, giving the vote to all Catholic landowners of a certain value. Sir Hercules and his wife Sarah Myhill of Killarney had six children, three sons and three daughters. Their eldest son, Robert (1756-1835), graduated as a barrister from the King's Inns . He became an MP for Knocktopher (1783-1796), where both father and son sat together in Houses of Parliament. In 1782 he married an heiress, Anne Boyle, a granddaughter of the Archbishop of Armagh . In 1796 he too became a Revenue Commissioner. After Sir Hercules died in 1811, Robert became the 2nd Baronet, Sir Robert Langrishe. He was heavily involved in theatre. And after he died in 1835 his second son, Hercules Richard (1782‚Äì1862), who had entered the Church, became the 3rd Baronet, Rev Sir Hercules Langrishe. They had eight children with his wife, Maria Cottingham. Sir James Langrishe (1823-1910) as 4th Baronet succeeded Rev Sir Hercules when he died in 1862. He married twice, became Lt Col. in the Army and High Sheriff of County Kilkenny 1866. They had one son, Hercules, and five daughters. Hercules Robert (‚ÄòHerky‚Äô, 1859-1943) graduated from Trinity College, Dublin in 1753 and succeeded Robert when he died in 1770 as Sir Hercules Robert Langrishe the 5th Baronet. He was by all accounts a dashing young aristocrat, who developed powerful connections to the King Edward VII. Famously in 1904, Hercules invited King Edward VII , whom he knew well, and Queen Alexandra to visit Knocktopher Abbey. The invitation was accepted but it backfired over a prank and the visit never happened. He was High Sheriff in 1891 and reached Deputy Lieutenant in Army and served in Russia. He married Lady Helen Hume Dick and they had two sons. In 1943 his son Sir Terence Hume Langrishe (Pingo, 1895-1973) became the 6th Baronet and served in World War I and World War II. He became a Lloyd‚Äôs name. He married Joan Grigg with whom he had three sons and the eldest, Sir Hercules Ralph Hume Langrishe (Heck, 1927-1998), succeeded him as the 7th Baronet in 1973. He had attended Eton before joining the Army and marrying Lady Grania Wingfield, daughter of The 9th Viscount Powerscourt. They had four children, including one son who succeeded him in 1998 - Sir James Hercules Langrishe, the 8th Baronet (1957-). The 9th Baronet heir apparent is the present holder‚Äôs son, Richard James Hercules Langrishe (1988-). ==Achievements== Sporting It has a soccer club - Southend United. Its hurling club is Ballyhale Shamrocks. Knocktopher GAA Hurling Club amalgamated with Ballyhale Shamrocks and Knockmoylan GAA Clubs in 1972. The late Fr Anthony Heaslip, brother of Knocktopher man, Denis Heaslip, was credited with being central to the founding of Ballyhale Shamrocks. Since 1981 to date they have since won a national record number of 8 All Ireland Senior Club Hurling Championships. Three Knocktopher born hurlers have won Senior Hurling All Ireland medals with Kilkenny - Frank Cummins won in 1967 (non playing sub), 1969, 1972, 1974, 1975, 1979, 1982, 1983, Denis Heaslip won in 1957, 1963 and Sean O' (John) Farrell won in 1933 (non playing sub) who played club hurling for Carrickshock GAA at that time - a club founded in 1928 when the teams from Hugginstown and Knockmoylan were amalgamated to commemorate the Battle of Carrickshock, 1831. Sporting achievements are not new to Knocktopher. According to Art Kavangh's book, Mary Langrishe, sister of Sir Hercules Robert Langrishe‚Äôs 1859-1943) and the 5th Baronet, was the Irish Lawn Tennis Ladies Champion on three occasions during the 1880s. And Knocktopher Footballers won the Kilkenny Senior Football Championship four times - 1901, 1908, 1910 and 1911. In their booklet to celebrate the Ballyhale C.D.S. (1895-1995) Cooperative Creamery anniversary, they carry a photo of the Knocktopher football 1908-1910 squad and note too that Knocktopher were the backbone of the County Kilkenny football team of 1911, the year they won the Leinster Senior Football Championship, beating Kildare. They were beaten in the All-Ireland Football Semi-final by Antrim that year, a feat never since surpassed by Kilkenny footballers. One of their best known footballers of that time was Patrick J. Power, who was Manager of Ballyhale Creamery (1909-1920), and also represented Knocktopher in the Kilkenny team of 1911. Other The Treacy Clan record that Knocktopher had a well known Cricket Team in 1884, among the best known players being batsman, W. Power, and bowler, D. Treacy; that local competitors included teams from Ballyhale, Kilcurl, Knockmoylan, Hugginstown and Kilmoganny; and that the matches often took place on a cricket ground provided by Langrishes at Knocktopher Abbey. There were over 40 cricket teams in County Kilkenny at the time. Other notable events included the holding of the National Ploughing Championships in Knocktopher in 1978,. Kilcurl born Sean O' (John) Farrell was Managing Director of its Irish National Ploughing Association from 1958-72. ==Public transport== The village is served on Thursday only by Bus √âireann route 365 from Thomastown to Waterford.http://www.buseireann.ie/inner.php?id=247#Kilkenny However Ballyhale only 2 kilometres distant has numerous daily Bus √âireann and JJ Kavanagh and Sons services linking it to Dublin, Waterford, Kilkenny, Thomastown and Athlone.

It is endemic to Mount Pel√©e, Martinique. Allobates chalcopis is the only aromobatidDendrobatid in the taxonomy employed by Fouquet et al. (2013). species endemic to an oceanic island. This has led to a suggestion that it is not native but an introduced species, synonymous with some mainland species. However, examination of new specimens with molecular phylogenetics methods suggests it is truly distinct from the mainland Allobates, and highly diverged from its closest relatives. This conclusion is also supported by morphological and ecological evidence, thereby strengthening the position that it is a true endemic. ==Description== Allobates chalcopis is a small frog with males measuring about in snout‚Äìvent length and females about . Its dorsum is light brown with darker markings. Males have a distinctive, black throat, tapering off to a dark gray, whereas females have uniformly pale orange throat and venter.

Atrial Septal Defect  The Three Malformations  {  !Condition !Description - Pulmonary Stenosis A malformation near or on the pulmonary valve (the valve between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery) that causes the opening of the valve to be narrowed, affecting blood flow. This narrowing can occur when one or more of the cusps is too thick or is otherwise defective, preventing the valve from opening fully and properly. - Right Ventricular Hypertrophy The right ventricle is more muscular than normal, causing a characteristic boot-shaped appearance as seen by chest X-ray. This enlargement is generally a secondary condition, resulting from increased pressure. Pulmonary valve defects resulting in tricuspid regurgitation, a common effect of pulmonary stenosis, can cause this increase in muscle mass. - Atrial Septal Defect An atrial septal defect is a hole in the septum that divides the right and left atria (the upper two chambers) of the heart. In the heart of a developing fetus, there are several holes between the atria, however these are expected to close before birth. This congenital condition arises if one of these holes remains.

Their heads are longer than they are wide, and the tympanum is small. The forelimbs have a moderate length and the fingers are unwebbed. The toes do not have lateral fringes and the terminal discs are expanded. It is dark-coffee in colour with a gold iris and cream ventral surfaces. ==Biology== The mating system of the Epipedobates machalilla includes cephalic amplexus. The female will produce around 15 eggs which are left on the ground or under leaves. The female will then leave, and the male will protect the development of the embryos and carry the larvae. When the tadpoles hatch (around 20 days after fertilization occurs), the male will take the tadpoles to riverbanks or pools of water so metamorphosis and growth can take place. Epipedobates machalilla displays a cryptic phenotype despite being in the aposematic genus Epipedobates and likely lost an aposematic trait that evolved when Epipedobates first diverged. However, it is believed that with the high intra-specific phenotypic diversity observed within poison frogs and the role of diet in toxicity that there could be chemically defended E. machalilla populations. ==Distribution== Epipedobates machalilla is endemic to West Ecuador, where it lives in dry and low forests.

It is found in northwestern Colombia and Panama. It is one of the best studied poison dart frogs; however, until 2004 Colostethus panamansis was considered a synonym of Colostethus inguinalis, and consequently the older literature uses that name. ==Distribution and habitat== Female carrying tadpoles on her back Colostethus panamansis is found in several parts of Panama and in Parque Nacional Natural Los Katios in Colombia. It is found living near streams in forested lowland and hilly country, usually at elevations below . ==Biology== Adult males measure in snout‚Äìvent length and adult females . The female lays her eggs in clutches among leaf litter. When they hatch, she carries them around on her back for up to nine days when she immerses herself in a fast flowing stream and they become detached and continue their development in the water. ==Research== The pathogenic fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis causes the emerging infectious disease chytridiomycosis which is the cause of the decline in many species of tropical amphibian. Colostethus panamansis was used to demonstrate that the fungus was indeed the pathogen responsible for the disease. Healthy rocket frogs from El Cop√© in Panama were collected and shown to be free of B. dendrobatidis. They were then exposed to an isolate of the fungus. Some of these died and from these B. dendrobatidis was reisolated and was demonstrated to be identical to the original infective agent thus fulfilling Koch's postulates. ==Conservation status== Colostethus panamansis is listed as being of \\"Least Concern\\" in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

Abstract. discovered an ecological dependence between the plant and four species of frugivorous birds in southeastern Spain; blackbirds and blackcaps proved to be the most important seed dispersers. When Prunus mahaleb is fruiting, these birds consume the fruit almost exclusively, and disperse the seeds to the locations favourable for the tree's growth. The way in which some birds consume the fruits and the habitats those birds use may act as a selective force in determining which genetic variations of the cherry flourish.Guiti√°n, J. et al. (1992).

Oikos 63 (1): 125-130. ==Cultivation and uses== St Lucie cherry stones The plant is cultivated for a spice obtained from the seeds inside the cherry stones. It is fragrant and has the taste of bitter almonds.https://extension.wsu.edu/whitman/2013/11/mahaleb- cherry/ It is used in small quantities to sharpen sweet foods, such as the Turkish sweet-bread √ß√∂rek (chorak), the Greek sweet-bread tsoureki or the Armenian sweet-bread chorak. The chemical constituents are still uncertain, but the spice is prepared from the seeds, either by grinding and powdering the seed kernels, or in oil extracted from the seeds.Gernot Katzer's Spice Pages: Mahaleb Cherry (Prunus mahaleb L.) The wood is hard, and is used in cabinet- making and for pipes.Vedel, H., & Lange, J. (1960). Trees and Bushes in Wood and Hedgerow. Metheun & Co. Ltd., London.

They have anti- inflammatory, sedative and vasodilation effects. Away from its native range, the species is grown as an ornamental tree for its strongly fragrant flowers, throughout temperate regions of the world. A number of cultivars have been selected for their ornamental value, including 'Albomarginata', with variegated foliage, 'Bommii', a dwarf with strongly pendulous branches, 'Globosa', a compact dwarf clone, 'Pendula', with drooping branching, and 'Xanthocarpa' with yellow fruit.Bean, W. J. (1976). Trees and Shrubs Hardy in the British Isles. John Murray . The fruit of Prunus mahaleb is inedible. ==Early history of mahaleb in human use== Prunus mahaleb is a likely candidate for the ·∏´alub-tree mentioned in early Sumerian writings, a durable fruit- bearing hardwood with seeds and leaves known for their medicinal properties and associated with the goddess Inana.Gadotti, A. (2014). Gilgamesh, Enkidu, and the Netherworld and the Sumerian Gilgamesh Cycle. De Gruyter. . The Arabic ŸÖÿ≠ŸÑÿ® mahleb or mahlab meaning the mahaleb cherry is in medieval Islamic writings by among others Al-Razi (died 925 or 932), Ibn al-Baitar (died 1248) and Ibn al-Awwam.\\"Mahaleb\\" in Remarques sur les mots fran√ßais d√©riv√©s de l'arabe, by Henri Lammens, year 1890. Ibn Al-Awwam in his book on agriculture dated late 12th century described how to cultivate the mahaleb tree: he says the tree is a vigorous grower, easy to grow, but a thing to watch out for is that it is not resistant to prolonged drought. He also described how to prepare the mahaleb seeds by boiling them in sugared water.Le livre de l'agriculture, by Ibn al-'Awwam, translated to French J.-J. Cl√©ment-Mullet, year 1866, volume II page 367-368. The word, and probably the mahaleb itself, does not appear in classical Latin, nor early or mid medieval Latin, and is rare in late medieval Latin. One early record in Latin is year 1317 in an encyclopedia by Matthaeus Silvaticus who wrote that the \\"mahaleb\\" is the kernel seed of the fruit of both domesticated and wild cherry trees in Arabic countries.\\"Maaleb\\" and \\"mahaleb\\" in the Pandectarum of Matthaeus Silvaticus (in Latin). Another early record in Latin is in a medical-botany book by Ioannis Mesuae in 1479 spelled almahaleb (where \\"al-\\" is the Arabic definite article). In 1593 the Latin botanist Carolus Clusius spelled it mahaleb.Mahaleb @ CNRTL.fr (in French). Today its cultivation and use is largely restricted to the region that in the 19th and earlier centuries formed the Ottoman Empire. Syria is the main exporting country. ==ReferencesExternal links== mahaleb Category:Flora of Lebanon Category:Plants described in 1753 Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus Category:Fruit trees ","title":"Prunus mahaleb"},{"id":"12367647","text":"Onyekachi Paul Nwoha (born 28 February 1983 in Aba) is a Nigerian footballer who plays as a forward.Onyekachi Nwoha, pemain Nigeria beraksi diposisi serangan (MALAY) Retrieved at 15 February 2012 ==Club career== Onyekachi Nwoha began his career with FC Spiders, before he transferred to Enyimba International in 2001.

Colostethus pratti is named after Antwerp Edgar Pratt, an explorer who collected the type series. ==Description== Colostethus pratti is a small member of its genus; both males and females grow to about snout‚Äìvent length. It is brown above with characteristic dull paired dorsolateral stripes. ==Reproduction== Reproduction of Colostethus pratti has been observed in captivity. Males have a loud, peeping advertisement call. They appear to establish small territories and can be aggressive against each other, engaging in \\"wrestling\\" bouts. Amplexus has not been observed but is presumably cephalic as in related species. Egg clusters contain 8-20 eggs. They are deposited on top of leaves or within plastic hiding places, primarily during a simulated wet season. Eggs hatch in 1‚Äì2 weeks. After hatching, the female transports the tadpoles to a body of water, carrying them on her back, sometimes for several days. No further parental care is provided. Tadpoles metamorphose 8‚Äì13 weeks after hatching. Newly metamorphosed froglets are in length. Some males start calling as soon as six months post-metamorphosis. ==Habitat and conservation== Colostethus pratti is a common frog.

Its general colour is some shade of brown and it has a dark stripe running down either side extending about half way along the body. There are bluish-white specks below this and on the toes.

Breeding takes place in the rainy season. The male finds a suitable location and calls to attract a female. The nesting site is a boat-shaped curled up fallen leaf with another above acting as a roof. The female lays three to six eggs with gelatinous capsules inside the hollow leaf and remains at the nest for about an hour. After that she departs and the male returns and guards the eggs. He is territorial and drives off male intruders and seldom goes further than from the nest, continuing to remain nearby as the tadpoles develop. Further females are encouraged to lay inside the nest which may come to have several developing clutches of eggs of different ages. The developing larvae are not transported to water, as is the case with the related dendrobatids, but complete their development on land. Metamorphosis into juvenile frogs occurs after about 31 days. ==Status== Colostethus stepheni is listed as being of \\"Least Concern\\" in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

The fingers and toes are unwebbed. ==Reproduction== Allobates talamancae lay the eggs in the leaf-litter, and both parents carry the tadpoles to streams where they complete their development in small, water-filled depressions. ==Habitat, ecology, and conservation== Allobates talamancae is found in a variety of habitats in very humid lowland and premontane habitats (secondary growth and plantations, swampy areas in primary forest, but not in open areas), usually close to streams. It can be found up to ( in Colombia) above sea level. Its diet consists of small arthropods. Adult frogs are found to aggregate, forming small groups, likely as an anti-predator adaptation. It is common species; threats to it are habitat loss, introduction of alien predatory fish, and pollution. ==References== talamancae Category:Amphibians of Colombia Category:Amphibians of Costa Rica Category:Amphibians of Ecuador Category:Amphibians of Nicaragua Category:Amphibians of Panama Category:Amphibians described in 1875 Category:Taxa named by Edward Drinker Cope Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Allobates talamancae"},{"id":"12367747","text":"Anomaloglossus tamacuarensis is a species of frog in the family Aromobatidae.

Most of the lake is located in Williamson County, southeast of Carbondale, Illinois. The lake is accessible from Giant City Road out of Carbondale, Illinois. Two arms of the lake penetrate into adjacent Jackson County. The lake is managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as part of the Crab Orchard National Wildlife Refuge. ==History == Little Grassy Lake was built in 1940 as part of federal relief efforts surrounding recovery from the Great Depression. The surrounding hills, forested with oak and hickory trees, did not offer good farming potential, and the federal government condemned the farms to construct the lake.\\"Shawnee National Forest\\" (7/12/07; U.S. Forest Service, Washington, D.C.), accessed July 21, 2007.\\"Lakes and Marinas\\" (2007; Williamson County Tourism Bureau, Marion, Ill.), accessed July 21, 2007. In 1959, activity around the lake increased when the Illinois Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) chose a land parcel near the Little Grassy dam as the site for its primary warm-water hatchery for the production of fish such as largemouth bass, bluegill, channel catfish, and redear sunfish for stocking. , 15.0 million fingerlings are produced annually.\\"Little Grassy Fish Hatchery\\" (no date; Illinois Department of Natural Resources, Springfield, Ill.), accessed July 21, 2007. ==The lake today== Little Grassy Lake is managed for warmwater fishing, with largemouth bass, bluegill, channel catfish, and crappie stocked and caught.Joe McFarland, \\"The Unique Refuge\\", Outdoor Illinois XIX:3 (March 2011), pages 14-15. There is a power limit on the lake, with motors restricted to 10 h.p. or less. A U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service permit is required for use of the lake. A campground and marina operates during fishing season. Little Grassy Lake is IDNR's sole catfish hatchery. For catfish, the spawning and fish maturation process requires at least one year, with mature fish spawning on or around June 1; the fish take at least 13 months to grow to a \\"nonvulnerable\\" length of 8 inches (20 cm) and are typically ready for delivery to their new homes in July of the following summer. IDNR distributes Little Grassy catfish to 220 separate Illinois waterways.Brenda Garver, \\"In the Company of Catfish\\", Outdoor Illinois XV:5 (May 2007), pages 6-8. A stretch of spillway directly below the Little Grassy dam, measuring 0.2 miles (0.3 km) in length, is a noted whitewater spot, rated at Class II-IV depending on spillway flow conditions. The spillway tends to operate during rain or snow meltwater runoff events in winter and early spring.\\"Little Grassy Creek, IL\\" (10/11/05; American Whitewater, Cullowhee, N.C.), accessed July 21, 2007.

However, his parents moved their family to London by 1840. On 3 April 1860, under the name of William Thomas, at St Anne, Limehouse, London, he married Amelia Martha Flint (1836-1903).London Metropolitan Archives; London, England; Reference Number: p93/ann/035 Amelia was also a professional actor under the stage name \\"Miss Minnie Foster\\".\\"The late Horace Lingard\\", The Stage, 10 February 1927, p 13. Together they had a child, William Harry Thomas (1861-1941), born on 7 November 1861. William Harry later became an actor, known professionally as \\"Horace Lingard junior\\".\\"The late Horace Lingard\\", The Stage, 10 February 1927, p 13.\\"Horace Lingard: Old actor with tray is 80 today\\", Sheffield Independent, 7 November 1936. However, the marriage with Amelia Flint fell apart soon afterwards and Lingard bigamously married 19 year old Alice Dunning (1845-1897) at Bristol in June 1866. A decade later, in 1877, Amelia successfully sued Lingard for divorce on the grounds of proven adultery. She was also awarded custody of her child.Nell Darby, Life on the Victorian Stage: Theatrical Gossip (Pen & Sword History, 2017) p 120. Amelia later married an East London engineer, William Musto (1828-1896), in 1878. Together they ran the White Horse Tavern in Mile End Old Town, London, in the 1890s. On 11 August 1883, Lingard (still calling himself a ‚Äúbachelor‚Äù) married Alice Dunning legally at Holy Trinity, Grays Inn Road, London. The witnesses on this occasion were Alice‚Äôs sister Harriet Sarah Dunning and her husband Davison Dalziel.London Metropolitan Archives; London, England; Reference Number: p82/tri2/012 ==Immigration to America and subsequent tours== In 1868, Lingard immigrated to America (along with his wife, Alice Dunning Lingard). He made his comic debut in New York City that year. After this debut‚Äîheld at the Theatre Comique, on 6 April 1868‚ÄîLingard became known as one of the funniest men of the time. He continued his career in New York, and later became manager of Wood's Theatre there. William Lingard, dressed as a woman on one of his song sheets. (circa ~1870) Lingard's troupe, which included Alice's sister, Harriet Sarah Dunning (who went by the stage name \\"Dickey Lingard\\")H P Phelps, Addenda to Players of a century: a record of the Albany stage, including notices of prominent actors who have appeared in America (Albany, 1889), p 2. toured Australia twice, the first time commencing in 1876 and the second commencing in 1879. During his second Australian tour, in 1880, Lingard was successfully sued in the Supreme Court of the Australian Colony of Victoria by Gilbert and Sullivan for his unauthorised production of HMS Pinafore. This most likely prompted ‚ÄúThe Wreck of the Pinafore‚Äù which was written by Lingard and set to music by Luscombe Searelle. ==Style== Lingard often appeared on stage in drag, in the high fashion style of the era. Additionally, he mastered the art of quick change, eventually becoming able to act the part of six characters, with only a few seconds for each costume change. ==Major role== Song sheet for Lingard's \\"Captain Jinks\\" performance, circa 1868. Lingard is chiefly remembered for the well-known vaudeville song, \\"Captain Jinks of the Horse Marines\\", sometimes shortened to simply \\"Captain Jinks.\\" Lingard wrote the lyrics, and the music is attributed to T. Maclagan.Captain Jinks at library.duke.edu/ It was a popular song of the 19th century, and is still sung to this day, having entered the country-western and bluegrass repertory. The song later became the basis of a stage comedy of the same title, written by Clyde Fitch, and a 1975 opera by Jack Beeson. The song has various renditions. == References == * E. J.

It was a modification of the earlier Nieuport Nighthawk fighter produced by Gloster after the Nieuport & General company, which designed the Nighthawk, closed down. Twenty-two were converted, serving with the British Royal Air Force from 1922 to 1924. ==Design and development== The prototype Nightjar The Nieuport & General Aircraft Co Ltd was formed before the start of the First World War to license-produce French Nieuport aircraft. During 1917, after hiring Henry Folland as chief designer, the company started to design its own aircraft, with the first type, the Nieuport B.N.1 fighter flying early in 1918. Folland designed the Nieuport Nighthawk fighter to meet the requirements of RAF Specification Type 1 which specified using the ABC Dragonfly radial engine, first flying in April 1919. During initial evaluation, this showed excellent performance, and was ordered into production. The Dragonfly engine, however, proved hopelessly unreliable, and none of the Dragonfly-powered Nighthawks that were completed entered service. Nieuport & General closed down in August 1920, and the rights to the Nighthawk were purchased by the Gloster Aircraft Company, who hired Folland as chief designer. Gloster proceeded to produce a number of derivatives of the Nighthawk, calling them Gloster Mars, with variants being sold to Japan (Gloster Sparrowhawk) and Greece, and being evaluated by the RAF. Nightjar during evaluation at Farnborough in 1922 - Note arrestor jaws on undercarriageThe final derivative of the Nighthawk was the Gloster Mars X, also known as the Nightjar. This was intended as a single-seat shipboard fighter to replace Sopwith Camels aboard the Royal Navy's aircraft carriers. It was a simple conversion of surplus Nighthawks, with the Bentley BR2 rotary engine (which was readily available from surplus stocks) replacing the Dragonfly. The Nightjar was a two-bay biplane of wooden construction, and was fitted with a new, wide-track undercarriage, with jaws fitted to act as arresting gear for use with the fore and aft arrestor cables then in use on British aircraft carriers. The first Nightjar was delivered for evaluation by the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment in May 1921. A total of 22 Nighthawks were converted to Nightjars in 1922. ==Operational history== The Nightjar entered service with 203 Squadron at RAF Leuchars in June 1922. Six Nightjars of 203 Squadron were deployed aboard HMS Argus in September 1922, when Argus sailed for the Dardanelles during the Chanak Crisis. The Nightjar continued to serve with fighter flights aboard Royal Navy aircraft carriers until replaced by the Fairey Flycatcher in 1924. ==Operators== ; *Royal Air Force ** No. 203 Squadron RAF *Royal Navy ==Specifications (Nightjar)== Production Nightjar without armament ==See alsoReferences== Notes Bibliography * James, Derek N.

According to the 2009 Guinness World Records, the Galyons were the oldest living set of conjoined twins in the world, and, as of 29 October 2014, possessed the world record for the longest-lived conjoined twins in history when they surpassed prior record holders Giacomo and Giovanni Battista Tocci. == Early life and career == They were born at St. Elizabeth Hospital in Dayton, Ohio, on October 28, 1951, to Wesley and Eileen Galyon. Eileen was not expecting twins. They were joined from the sternum to the groin and shared a set of organs. After a two-year stay in the hospital, it was determined that they could not be safely separated. Local schools deemed the twins a distraction, so they were not formally educated, resulting in their lifelong functional illiteracy. With nine children to support, their father Wesley decided to take the twins on the road as a sideshow attraction. The boys were exhibited in sideshows throughout the U.S. and later in Latin America. Their tours made them celebrities and provided an income with which they supported their family. The twins also tried to join the Army, but were ranked 4-F. == Later life == In 1991, after three decades in entertainment, the pair retired and moved into their first independent home in Dayton, Ohio, in a house purchased with sideshow earnings. They were active in the community and lived a largely normal life by means of a custom double wheelchair. Although retired from show business, the twins made numerous television appearances. They appeared on The Jerry Springer Show in 1997, a Discovery Channel documentary in 1998 and a Channel Five documentary in 2009. In 2009, Ronnie developed a life-threatening infection in his lungs, which quickly endangered both twins. After their hospitalization, they required round-the- clock care. Their younger brother Jim and his wife Mary, who lived in the same city, were unable to bring the twins into their home as it was not handicap accessible, until an outpouring of donations and volunteers from the local community assisted in building a special addition to the home. On December 22, 2010, TLC premiered \\"The World's Oldest Conjoined Twins Move Home\\", which documented the building process as well as the twins' recovery and their return to the community. == Death == The twins died of congestive heart failure in hospice surrounded by their family in their native Dayton, Ohio, on July 4, 2020. ==References== Category:1951 births Category:2020 deaths Category:Conjoined twins Category:People from Dayton, Ohio Category:Sideshow performers Category:Twin people from the United States Category:Disease- related deaths in Ohio ","title":"Ronnie and Donnie Galyon"},{"id":"12368072","text":"Portrait.

Due to the temporary incapacity of one of the hospital's surgeons, Earle performed one-third of St. Bartholomew's operations between 1776 and 1784. At the end of this phenomenal feat, Earle was elected to be a surgeon on 22 May 1784 and remained until 1815. Just two years later, he was appointed surgeon-extraordinary to George III. In March, 1794 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. He was knighted in 1807. He married the daughter of Percivall Pott, the hospital's senior surgeon, and their third son, Henry Earle, also became a surgeon at St. Bartholomew's. Earle write a memoir of Pott that was subsequently attached to his complete works (1790) and a biography of William Austin. Earle was renowned for his surgery skills, particularly in lithotomy. He also published several medical works: A Treatise on the Hydrocele (1791, with additions in 1793, 1796, and 1805), Practical Observations on the Operation for Stone (1793), A New Method of Operation for Cataract (1801), and Letter on Fractures of the Lower Limbs (1807).Moore, Norman and Michael Bevan. \\"Sir James Earle.\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography.

Davis plays a fictionalised version of himself, and both Gervais and Merchant appear in supporting roles as themselves. The show began airing on BBC Two on 10 November 2011. Premium cable channel HBO, which co- produced the series with the BBC, have the US rights and began airing the series on 19 February 2012. In January 2013, it was announced that Life's Too Short would end later in the year with a special that would bring the series' closure. The one-hour special aired on 30 March 2013 in the UK and 5 July 2013 in the US. ==Background== The genesis of the show is from when Davis worked with Gervais and Merchant in an episode of the second series of Extras, when he co-starred with Daniel Radcliffe. Gervais said that Davis is funny in real life and tells great stories. Merchant said that Davis helped create the idea. Gervais and Merchant approached the BBC about developing a show centred on a character based on Davis. > The real Warwick tells us these great stories. They're comedy gold. (The > show) is a cross between Extras and Curb Your Enthusiasm and One Foot in the > Grave but with a dwarf. That is out and out funny.\\" Warwick runs a small person talent agency and playing a twisted version of himself; he's quite conceited, arrogant and manipulative. He is doing this documentary to improve his career as he is going through a messy divorce and needs the money. Warwick bugs Rick and Stephen about whether they have any work, much to their annoyance. In an interview with Jonathan Ross, Davis said that his character is egotistical and suffers from small man syndrome, Gervais said of the character > He refuses to live his life as a disabled person. We're making him empowered > but also give him these foibles\\" Third in our trilogy of TV sitcoms ‚Ä¶ > another naturalist observational comedy, dealing with everyday problems, > human foibles and social faux pas ‚Ä¶ but with a dwarf. ==Episodes== Series 1 (2011) { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"width: 100%; margin-right: 0;\\" - ! 515252; color:#fff; width:4%;\\" No. ! 515252; color:#fff; width:20%;\\" Episode ! 515252; color:#fff; width:48%;\\" Celebrity guest star(s) ! 515252; color:#fff; width:14%;\\" UK viewers (No permanent link available.

The pilot for the comedy was commissioned by the BBC in April 2010. Gervais reported on progress in his blog. In April 2010, he stated, \\"Some reports are saying that the Life's Too Short pilot we are shooting in the summer will be aired. It wont . It is a non-broadcast pilot. We will shoot the whole series before anything is aired. We're not sure how many eps [episodes] we will record (probably 6) and not sure when the series will air.\\" Gervais wrote on his blog in June 2010 \\"Found the last location today for Life's Too Short. It feels great doing this project. Just like The Office and Extras. Starting from scratch, just me and Steve in a room crafting a brand new show. It doesn't get better than that for me.\\" He later wrote that filming of the pilot was undertaken in June and July 2010. Gervais commented in July 2010 \\"Finished the pilot for Life's Too Short too. Just have to write the series now\\". The series was produced by Charlie Hanson, who previously produced Extras, and Michelle Farr. The series was executive produced by Gervais and Merchant along with Mark Freeland. On 17 September 2010 the BBC announced, via the BBC Two Controller Janice Hadlow, and the Controller of BBC Comedy Commissioning Cheryl Taylor, that the six- part series had been commissioned and filmed in 2011. In June 2010, while talking at the Banff World Media Festival, Gervais described Life's Too Short as \\"the funniest thing we've done.\\" Gervais told The Hollywood Reporter \\"We're having so much fun working with Warwick. Pound for pound he is one of the funniest men I know.\\" Stephen Merchant said of Davis: \\"Warwick is very funny, a very physical comedian which we really made use of ‚Ä¶ He's very charismatic, very charming in it ‚Ä¶ I was really pleased. He's a real comic star in waiting.\\" Gervais reported in his blog on the progress of writing Life's Too Short throughout November 2010: \\"Had a great week writing Life's Too Short. It's the hardest bit, the most important bit and the most invigorating bit\\", and in a later entry \\"Wrote one of the funniest sketches we've ever done for Life's Too Short. Six hours hard labour for a potential two minutes screen time.\\" In January 2011 he reported that he was still working on the scripts for the show, and in February that he and Merchant were trying to finish writing Life's Too Short. In March 2011 Gervais reported on his blog \\"Getting ready to film Life's Too Short.\\" Merchant confirmed that filming would begin in May 2011. Cast members included Jo Enright, who played Warwick Davis' wife in the pilot, Shaun Williamson, who played himself (known as \\"Barry off EastEnders\\") in Extras, Cat Deeley, Rosamund Hanson, Kiruna Stamell and Jamie Dodd. Boxer Mike Tyson also asked Gervais to consider casting him in a role. On 31 March 2011 Gervais confirmed on his blog that \\"We've basically got first drafts of all seven episodes of Life's Too Short now. Yes seven!\\". As the pilot has already been filmed, the series will comprise eight shows. On 1 April he stated \\"Started casting Life's Too Short this week too. So much fun.\\" On 29 April he wrote \\"Did the last of the casting today on Life's Too Short. Some amazing cameos too. You know about the [Johnny] Depp one, but hopefully we might be able to keep a couple of the other really big ones under wraps. Not just because of the surprise factor but because it takes the focus away from the real meat of the show.\\" On 11 May the cast had their first read- through of all seven episodes, and rehearsals started on the week beginning 16 May 2011 with Gervais commenting \\"We've put together an amazing cast so it should be a joy.\\" Filming started on 30 May 2011. On 22 June 2011 it was announced that Sting and Steve Carell would be filming cameos for the series. The teaser trailer released on the same day featured Keith Chegwin, Les Dennis and Shaun Williamson as well as the three main stars. On 11 July Gervais hinted on his blog that a Doctor Who-related cameo would be in the show, as well as posting a link to a YouTube video of him and Warwick Davis filmed on the set of Life's Too Short. Earlier in that week he had blogged about how \\"Matt Groening's favourite character from The Office will make a cameo in Life's Too Short\\", along with an on-set photograph of actor Ewen MacIntosh who played Big Keith in The Office. Principal filming ran for eight weeks ending on 22 July 2011. Gervais and Davis attended a question and answer session to discuss the making of Life's Too Short at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in August 2011. A half-hour-long documentary, The Making of Life's Too Short, aired on BBC Two and BBC HD on 5 November 2011, prior to the start of the series run. After the first series finished airing, Gervais confirmed via Twitter that a second series had been commissioned for early 2013. Despite this, Gervais stated on his blog that \\"We are thinking of going straight to the Xmas Special. Lazier and lazier. Now it's down to ONE series and a special. Ha ha.\\"Blog! RickyGervais.com The series finale premiered on 5 July 2013 in the US on HBO and is available to view on HBO Go. ==Cast== *Warwick Davis as himself *Ricky Gervais as himself *Stephen Merchant as himself *Steve Brody as Eric *Rosamund Hanson as Cheryl *Jo Enright as Sue *Shaun Williamson as himself * Les Dennis as himself * Keith Chegwin as himself Cameo appearances * Liam Neeson (Episode 1) * Johnny Depp (Episode 2) * Helena Bonham Carter (Episode 3) * Right Said Fred (Episode 4) * Steve Carell (Episode 4) * Ramin Karimloo (Episode 5) * Cat Deeley (Episode 6) * Ewen MacIntosh (Episode 6) * Sting (Episode 7) * Sophie Ellis-Bextor (Episode 7) * Val Kilmer (Episode 8) ==Reception== UK critical response In the United Kingdom the first series received mostly mixed reviews. Rachel Tarley, of Metro, described the show as \\"tripe\\" while David Butcher of the Radio Times introduced his review of episode six with \\"another week, another queasy mix of comedy and unpleasantness.\\" Many reviews were deeply critical of the writing ‚Äì Gwilym Mumford of The Guardian felt that writers Gervais and Merchant were \\"on autopilot,\\" referring to the programme as \\"strikingly lazy stuff, little more than a predictable checklist of taboos and social faux pas,\\" and journalist for The Independent Robert Epstein likewise branded it \\"shoddily derivative\\" and potentially degrading. T.J. Barnard, Associate Editor for WhatCulture!, called the show \\"a mess. It's aimless, indulgent, self-plagiarizing and cold.\\" However, Metros review of episode 7 was slightly more positive saying \\"Life's Too Short bowed out tonight with an episode that was more than marginally better than the six previous offerings, not only was the plot stronger than in previous weeks, but there were some genuinely funny scenes too, most notably a discussion between Gervais and Merchant about charity. And Steve Brody as Warwick's ineffectual giggly/depressive accountant continued to shine.\\" More positive reviews could be found in The Telegraph, where Gerald O'Donovan praised the show for its \\"belly laughs and cringe-making moments.\\" Likewise, Caroline Frost of The Huffington Post applauded both the writing and the acting following the first episode, proclaiming that though it could easily have overreached, \\"Gervais and Merchant have pulled another one out of the hat.\\" While the first episode rated strongly in the UK, the ratings dropped by 40% in the following week, and by the fifth episode the overnight ratings had dropped below a million, to 997,000‚Äî35% down on the average audience for its timeslot in the UK. Critical reaction to the Easter special was more positive, Dan Owen of msn.tv said \\"this Easter special was one of Life's Too Short's better episodes and provided enough laughs and fun to please most viewers.\\" He felt that the special felt like a new pilot for the show that \\"fixed a few problems.\\" He felt that Keith Chegwin, Shaun Williamson and Les Dennis were the funniest parts of the hour. Overall he gave the special 3 stars out of five. The Metro agreed saying, \\"there were laughs to be had here, mainly from the antics of Williamson, Chegwin and Dennis.\\" The Guardian praised the episode and called it \\"a piece of genius\\" and admired it for being \\"done with such a breathtaking boldness.\\" Harry Venning of The Stage gave a positive review of the first series also gave a positive review of the special \\"My favourite comedy of 2011 enjoyed a last hurrah. Sadly, it looks as though there will be no second series.\\" He felt that Rosamund Hanson provided scene- stealing support as dippy secretary Cheryl. He concluded that overall Life's Too Short was \\"Painfully poignant, beautifully played and constantly inventive, this one-hour special conclusively proved that Life‚Äôs Too Shorts own end was also premature.\\" US critical response In the United States the show received generally positive reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the show received an average score of 63, based on 14 reviews, which indicates \\"Generally favorable reviews\\". On Rotten Tomatoes, the show holds a rating of 55% based on 33 critics, with the consensus reading: \\"Life's Too Short is enjoyably crass, but borrows heavily from Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant's previous work.\\" ==Home media releases== Life's Too Short was released on DVD and Blu-ray on 22 October 2012 in the UK, 7 November 2012 in Australia and on 15 January 2013 in the US. The Special was released onto DVD in the UK on 2 February 2015. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Life's Too Short RickyGervais.com * * Category:2011 British television series debuts Category:2013 British television series endings Category:2010s British sitcoms Category:BBC television sitcoms Category:HBO original programming Category:2010s British satirical television series Category:British mockumentary television series Category:Metafictional television series Category:English-language television shows Category:Television series created by Ricky Gervais Category:Television series created by Stephen Merchant ","title":"Life's Too Short (TV series)"},{"id":"12368153","text":"Kala Keerthi Camillus Perera is a Sri Lankan cartoonist.

Perera was invited to join the advisory board of John Lent's Cartoon Journal in 2002. == Life and career ==  Early life  Perera was born in Negombo and was the eldest son in a family of four. He was educated at the Roman Catholic Sinhala School, Maris Stella and St. Mary's College, Negombo. Perera first dabbled in art in the lower grades. He also briefly pursued a career as a sportsman in his teens leading the Jupiter Football Association in Negombo.

Perera's characters In April 1984 Perera produced a magazine devoted to his work titled Camillusge Gajaman. Its success, with over 200,000 copies sold, prompted the followups Camillusge Samayan in December and Camillusge Gajaman #2 the next year. Both sold between 200,000-300,000 copies and resulted in the formation of Camillus Publications. Perera cited copyright issues as a primary reason for the creation of his new company. He subsequently registered his 15 characters with the Department of Registry and Patents. Camillusge Gajaman Samaga Sathsiri (later shortened to Sathsiri) released in 1986 was the first comic magazine by Camillus Publications and immediately sold over 150,000 copies eventually achieving a circulation of 200,000.

Robinson Orrin Williams Robinson (August 14, 1834 ‚Äì September 6, 1907) was a politician and businessman from the U.S. state of Michigan. He ran a successful logging operation in the Upper Peninsula and was elected to serve in both houses of the Michigan Legislature and two terms as the 31st Lieutenant Governor of Michigan, from 1899 to 1903 under Governors Hazen S. Pingree and Aaron T. Bliss. ==Early life== Robinson was born in Claremont, New Hampshire, to Williams Dean and Zilpah (Clement) Robinson. Orrin's great- grandfather, David Robinson, was a soldier in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War, reaching the rank of captain. After the war, David settled in Cornish, New Hampshire. A son, Everett Robinson, grandfather to Orrin, served in the War of 1812. Orrin's early education was in the public schools. At the age of ten, he went to live on a neighboring farm, where he worked on the farm during the summer for his board and clothes and attended school in the winter. When he was 17, he went to work for a year at a gun factory in Windsor, Vermont. After this he spent two more years working a farm in the summer and attending school during the winter. In 1854, at the age of 19, he borrowed fifty dollars to travel and join his uncle, S.S. Robinson, who was managing the Derby copper mine in Ontonagon County, Michigan. Arriving in June 1854, he worked for nearly two years at various mines in the area. In February 1856, he walked to Green Bay, Wisconsin, where he then proceeded by stage to Fond du Lac, then by rail to Chicago and Galena, Illinois on to Dubuque, Iowa. He then walked across the prairie to Fort Dodge and then to Kossuth County, Iowa, where he worked as an engineer in a saw-mill. Following the Spirit Lake massacre in March 1857, immigration into the area nearly stopped and combined with the Panic of 1857 created greater economic hardship than usual for a frontier community. Robinson nonetheless purchased of land and lived there for about five years. ==Return to Michigan== In 1862, Robinson returned to Michigan and settled at the village of Hancock, where he worked as a shipping clerk in the Quincy Mine until 1873. During that time, he had acquired about 2,000 acres (8 km¬≤) of pine timber land. In 1873, he organized the Sturgeon River Lumber Company, which built mills in Hancock. The owners of that company also organized the Sturgeon River Boom Company in 1875, and built a channel to bring logs from the Sturgeon River to Pike Bay. In 1881, Robinson purchased the land of John Chassell, a local banker and business man, located on Pike Bay. Robinson moved into Chassell's house and later built a new house on the same lot. To accommodate further expansion, the company's mills and principal operations were moved from Hancock to Chassell in 1887-88. By that time, the Duluth, South Shore and Atlantic Railway had extended a line to the area with a stop at the growing community that Robinson named Chassell. The new mill at Chassell, which had a capacity of twenty million board feet (47,000 m¬≥) a year, employed over two hundred and was considered one of the largest in the state. Robinson maintained an interest in the business until 1902, when it was sold to the C. H. Wooster Lumber Company. Robinson also invested successfully in orange groves in Florida. ==Political career== Robinson cast his first vote in a U.S. presidential election in 1856 for John C. Fr√©mont and was a firm Republican for the remainder of his life. He was a delegate from Michigan to the 1892 Republican National Convention. In November 1894, Robinson was elected to represent the 2nd district of Houghton in the Michigan State House of Representatives, and in 1896, he was elected to the Michigan Senate from the 32nd district. He was elected Lieutenant Governor of Michigan in 1898 with Governor Hazen S. Pingree and re-elected in 1900 with Governor Aaron T. Bliss. ==Family and legacy== Robinson married Cornelia L. Lombard, of Weathersfield, Vermont on August 20, 1865 in cleveland, Ohio. They raised two children: M. Ethel, who graduated from Mary Institute in St. Louis, Missouri, and the Boston Conservatory of Music; and Dean L., who finished a course of study at Smith Academy in St. Louis, Missouri, then entered the Phillips Exeter Academy in Exeter, New Hampshire, graduating in 1895. Dean graduated from the Literary Department of Harvard University in 1899 and the Columbia Law School in 1901. ==References== *The Political Graveyard *Dates in the History of Chassell, Michigan * * * Category:1834 births Category:1907 deaths Category:Members of the Michigan House of Representatives Category:Michigan state senators Category:Lieutenant Governors of Michigan Category:People from Claremont, New Hampshire Category:Michigan Republicans Category:People from Cornish, New Hampshire Category:People from Hancock, Michigan Category:People from Chassell, Michigan Category:19th-century American politicians Category:20th-century American politicians ","title":"Orrin W.

In 1968, he left Target Stores and was subsequently hired by May Department Stores, where he founded the Venture chain. In 1975, he \\"retired\\" from Mays and Venture and became chairman of the struggling Ayr-Way Stores in Indianapolis. After he turned around Ayr-Way Stores, he became a long time consultant to his friend Sam Walton and Wal-Mart Stores, Ames Department Stores, and others. In 1982, he founded his third chain, a warehouse club named The Wholesale Club, which inspired Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. to create its Sam's Club division in 1983. In 1991, he sold The Wholesale Club store chain to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., where it was merged with Sam's Club. ==Honors== He authored the Better Quality Upscale Discount Store Concept in America and was inducted into the Discount Store News Discount Hall of Fame in 1984. Sam Walton, who often consulted Geisse, called him \\"a pioneer in innovative retailing concepts.\\" ==Personal life== Geisse was married to the former Mary Ann Wakeen. Together they had ten children. Geisse died of a heart attack in Indianapolis in 1992.

It is overseen by the Ministry of Culture and Sports, and, as of 2009, is directed by Georgia Xatzi. When the original building was completed and opened in 1882, it was the first museum in Greece outside of Athens. The museum houses discoveries from the surrounding area, including the site of the Ancient Olympic Games. The collection includes objects produced and used in the area from prehistory to its time under Roman rule. The principal pieces in the museum are Hermes and the Infant Dionysus (attributed to Praxiteles), some objects from the Temple of Zeus, the Nike of Paionios, as well as an oenochoe that belonged to Phidias. The extent of its bronze collection makes it one of the most important in the world. Today, the museum is housed in two buildings: the principal building with twelve rooms for exhibitions, organized both around themes and ages of the objects. The other building is dedicated to the museum store, and is separate from the main structure, located on the path to the archaeological site. == History of the museum == Excavation work at Altis in the 19th century quickly necessitated the construction of a building to display uncovered objects and works of art. The banker Andreas Syngros paid 220,000 drachmas to fund the construction and entrusted the design and building of the museum to two German architects and archaeologists who had begun the excavation on the site. Wilhelm Dorpfeld and Friedrich Adler, the architects, oversaw the construction of a neo-classical building which was erected on the hill of Drouva near the way out of Olympie toward the sanctuary. Finished in 1888, it was the first Greek museum built outside of Athens. It was damaged in 1954 by an earthquake, and later proved ultimately too small to house and display the museum‚Äôs expanding collections. Plans to build a new museum were approved in the 1970s. Although it was unused for some time, the original building was re-purposed and since 2004 has been a museum about the history of the original Olympic games. == Collections == Pediment of the Temple of Zeus. * Collection of terracottas (prehistoric, Archaic and Classical periods). * Collection of bronzes. * Collection of sculptures (Archaic up to the Roman periods). * Collection from the Olympic Games. == Notable holdings and exhibits== * The Hermes and the Infant Dionysus by Praxiteles (possibly) * The Nike of Paionios * Zeus carrying Ganymedes * Pediments of the Temple of Zeus * The helmet of Miltiades * Miniature bronze statue of a horse The statue of Apollo from the west pediment of the Temple of Zeus was depicted on the obverse of the Greek 1000 drachmas banknote of 1987-2001.Bank of Greece .

Lynskey had three younger brothers and two sisters and was educated at St. Francis Xavier's College then at the University of Liverpool. He earned an LLB (1907) and LLM (1908). He entered his father's practice as a solicitor in 1910, marrying Eileen Mary Prendiville in 1913. The couple had two daughters.Bryson (2004) ==The bar== In 1920 Lynskey took up the profession of a barrister, being called to the bar by the Inner Temple. He practised on the northern circuit, building up one of the largest provincial practices of the time and becoming a KC in 1930. David Maxwell Fyfe, a future prosecutor at the Nuremberg Trials was one of his pupils and praised Lynskey's geniality and conviviality. He became a bencher of the Inner Temple in 1938 and a judge of the Salford Hundred Court of Record in 1937. ==Senior judicial career== In 1944 a provincial barrister educated at a redbrick university with little exposure to the London bar or specialist practice, no matter how successful, was an unusual appointment for a High Court judge. However, he was appointed to the King's Bench and became an effective but unfailingly courteous judge in criminal trials at various assizes around England and Wales. In 1945, he sat with Lord Chief Justice Lord Goddard and Mr Justice Humphreys in the Court of Criminal Appeal in William Joyce's appeal against his conviction for treason during World War II. The court rejected Joyce's appeal. His most prominent role was as chair of the 1948 eponymous tribunal into alleged corruption among government ministers and civil servants. Lynskey won high praise for his handling of the inquiry but declined appointment as Lord Justice of Appeal when offered by the Lord Chancellor, the Earl Jowitt. ==Personality and death== Lynskey was comfortable with popular culture, a keen follower of sport, especially cricket and football. He supported Everton F.C.[Anon.] (1948) and, during the tribunal, was minded to correct Attorney-General Hartley Shawcross as to the date the football season had ended. After completing an assize in Manchester in 1957, he collapsed with coronary thrombosis and died soon after in Manchester Royal Infirmary. Lynskey was a devout Roman Catholic and Archbishop William Godfrey officiated at his requiem mass. He was buried at Brooklands cemetery, Weybridge, on 31 December. ==Honours== *Rupert Bremner gold medal of the Law Society (1910); *LLD, University of Liverpool (1951). ==ReferencesBibliography== *Obituaries **The Times, 23 December 1957 **Law Times, 3 January 1958 **St Francis Xavier's College Magazine (1957) \\\\---- *[Anon.] (1948) \\"The Bribes Tribunal Judge is Every Inch an Irishman\\", Sunday Pictorial, December 12 *Bryson, G.

He earned fame as one of the legendary Seven Blocks of Granite and played professionally for the Boston Yanks. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1980. ==Early life== Ed Franco was the youngest of nine children born to Italian immigrants, Nicola and Filomena Franco, on Christopher Street, in New York City. The family later moved to Jersey City, New Jersey, where Franco began to display his extraordinary athletic ability. He earned All-State honors at William L. Dickinson High School as both guard for the football team and catcher for baseball. ==Seven Blocks of Granite college football fame== After high school, Franco attended Fordham University, where he was elected president of his freshman class. He played guard and tackle for the legendary \\"Seven Blocks of Granite,\\" coached by the \\"Sleepy\\" Jim Crowley, one of the famed Four Horsemen of Notre Dame. The , Franco was voted as a consensus All-American for both positions following the 1937 and 1938 seasons, only one of two Fordham players ever named consensus All-American. He played alongside the famous Vince Lombardi, the right guard for the Blocks of Granite. In 1935 the Rams posted a 6-1-2 record with five shutouts. The 1936 squad lost only one game, the season finale to New York University. The Blocks saw their peak in 1937 with 8 wins, no losses, and no ties. Franco served as captain of the East team in the 1938 East-West Shrine Game. ==Professional football career and after== Franco had a brief professional career: He was a 5th round selection (31st overall) of the Cleveland Rams in the 1938 NFL Draft, but didn't stay with the team. On December 9, 1939, Franco married his sweetheart Anna May McGinley, a nursing student at Bayonne Nursing School. Franco decided not to continue his professional career, however, since at that time football paid little. Franco returned to Fordham as a line coach for six years, where he helped the Rams gain a Cotton Bowl Classic bid in 1941 and a Sugar Bowl bid in 1942. In 1944 Franco returned to the NFL and won the starting tackle job in his first game as a member of the Boston Yanks. He coached the American Association Jersey City Giants. Franco worked as the eastern scout for the Green Bay Packers and the Washington Redskins along with coach and close friend Lombardi. Franco later owned several successful businesses in Jersey City and Secaucus and worked for the Meadowlands Racetrack. He died on November 18, 1992, at the age of 77. He was survived by his three children, Margaret, Ned, and Rosemary, six grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren. ==Honors== In 1980, Ed Franco was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame. That same year, Franco a Jersey City baseball park was dedicated in his name; the park is still in use today. On October 24, 2008, Fordham University honored the memory of its legendary defensive line by dedicating a monument on its Rose Hill campus. The monumentmade of seven blocks of granite stonestands by the entrance to Jack Coffey Field. ==References== Category:1915 births Category:1992 deaths Category:All-American college football players Category:William L.

Her father was a White House Fellow and lawyer. She grew up in Maryland, first in Adelphi, and then from 1970 in Potomac. She has three siblings. She graduated from Harvard University in 1988. ==Career== Prior to beginning a writing career, Copaken was a war photographer from 1988 to 1992, and a television producer at ABC and NBC from 1992 to 1998. For the former, she was based in Paris and Moscow, while shooting assignments on conflicts in Zimbabwe, Afghanistan, Romania, Pakistan, Israel, Soviet Union and other places. She first worked as a producer at Day One in ABC News, where she received an Emmy, then in Dateline NBC. In 2001, she published a memoir of her experiences in war photojournalism, Shutterbabe. Her first novel Between Here and April was published in 2008 and won the November Elle Reader's Prize. In 2009, she released a book of comic essays, Hell is Other Parents, some of which appeared in the New Yorker and The New York Times. Her second novel, The Red Book, published by Hyperion/VOICE in April 2012, was a New York Times bestseller. The book was long-listed for the 2013 Women's Prize for Fiction. In 2016 and 2017, she released two nonfiction books, The ABCs of Adulthood and The ABCs of Parenthood, in collaboration with illustrator Randy Polumbo. She has written several articles for The New Yorker, The New York Times, Observer, The Atlantic, Business Insider, The Nation and others. She had also used Deborah Copaken Kogan as her pen name previously. She has performed and curated live storytelling for The Moth, Afterbirth, the Six Word Memoir series, Women of Letters, and Words and Music.

In March 2018 in The Atlantic, writing in second-person narrative, she accused New York Observer editor Ken Kurson of sexually harassing her. Copaken has also recounted that she was date raped on the night before her graduation. The next day she reported the incident to the university's health service, but was advised not to report her rape to police by her psychologist as the lengthy legal process might have affected her plans after graduation. In September 2018 in The Atlantic, she wrote that exactly 30 years after the incident in Harvard, she wrote to her assailant to remind him of the incident, and within half an hour the assailant called and apologized to her. ==Personal life== She lived in Paris and Moscow before moving to New York City in 1992.

People killed during the Night of the Long Knives () - the Nazi purge in which Hitler and the Nazi regime used the Schutzstaffel (SS) to deal with the problem of Ernst R√∂hm and his Sturmabteilung (SA) brownshirts (the original Nazi paramilitary organization), as well as past opponents of the party - numbered at least 85 people murdered. It took place in Germany between June 30 and July 2, 1934. Although most of those killed in what came to be known as \\"The Night of the Long Knives\\" were members of the SA, other victims included close associates of Vice Chancellor Franz von Papen, several Reichswehr (German Army) generals - one of whom, Kurt von Schleicher, was formerly the Chancellor of Germany - and their associates; Gregor Strasser, Hitler's former competitor for control of the Nazi Party; at least one person killed in a case of mistaken identity; and several innocent victims killed because they \\"knew too much.\\" The total number of victims is heavily disputed between historians; some estimates put the number in the hundreds. ==Debate over number of victims== The precise number of victims is disputed and will probably never be known with certainty. During the Purge itself official radio and newspaper reports only gave the names of 10 people killed: the six SA-leaders executed in Stadelheim Prison on June 30; Kurt von Schleicher, a German general and a former Chancellor of the Weimar Republic, and his wife; Karl Ernst, who was wrongly reported to have been shot in Stadelheim, whereas in fact he was shot in the barracks of Hitler's Personal Guard Unit in Berlin Lichterfelde; and Ernst R√∂hm. While the German newspapers avoided disclosing the names of further victims of the purge, in the weeks and months to follow, the international press would set out to detail a more comprehensive account of how many people had been killed between June 30 to July 2. They managed to present about 100 names of people allegedly killed, although a number of those eventually turned out to have survived, such as the former SA chief of Berlin Wolf-Heinrich Graf von Helldorf (who was actually one of the organizers of the purge - e.g. he warned Werner von Alvensleben, Schleicher's go-between to Hitler‚Äîbut not Schleicher‚Äîto spend the fateful weekend at his hunting lodge; and was himself only killed after participating in the fateful 20th of July 1944 coup attempt.) and Adolf Morsbach, the head of the cosmopolitan-minded Akademischer Austauschdienst (Academic Exchange Programme), who had instead been sent to a Nazi concentration camp.  Official list of those killed  Immediately after the events of the purge the Gestapo compiled an official list of those killed at the order of Hitler himself who wished to gain an overall view on the number and identity of those killed in order to prepare the Reichstag speech in which he intended to present his interpretation of the occurrences of June 30 to July 2 to the German public and the world in general, and which he finally delivered on July 13. This \\"Gestapo List\\" comprised a total of 77 names. In his Reichstag speech Hitler sub-divided those into 61 persons who had been shot during \\"the action\\"; allegedly 13 had died resisting arrest while three committed suicide. In his speech Hitler revealed the names of 11 of those 77 (Ferdinand von Bredow, Georg von Detten, Karl Ernst, Hans Hayn, Edmund Heines, Peter von Heydebreck, Ernst R√∂hm, Kurt von Schleicher, Gregor Strasser, and Julius Uhl). However, the list of 77 was far from being complete: Hitler admitted that some excesses had taken place and stated that he had handed over the cases of several people who had been killed as part of unauthorized actions by subordinate organs to the authorities, who were supposed to implement a regular prosecution of the perpetrators. Among those cases who were at first subject to regular investigation and prosecution by the locally responsible Attorney Offices were those of the city clerk Kuno Kamphausen who was murdered at the order of an SS officer who bore a grudge against him for refusing to give a construction permission to his brother and the cases of four Jews and two Communists who were killed without permission from Berlin in the course of arbitrary actions by lower SS echelons in the province of Silesia. In September 1934 Heinrich Himmler‚Äîeager to shield his SS men from legal prosecution‚Äîmanaged to convince Hitler to change his mind on the latter six people, whose names as a consequence, were subsequently added to the official list whose killing was to be considered rightful and which now encompassed 83 names. The list of 77 or 83 names respectively was kept in several copies‚Äîwhich were stored under lock and key‚Äîin the Ministry of Justice and the Gestapo Headquarters. After a law entitled \\"Gesetz √ºber Ma√ünahmen der Staatsnotwehr\\" (\\"Law pertaining to the Measures of Self-Defense of the State\\") had been passed by the Reich Cabinet on July 3, which declared: \\"Die zur Niederschlagung hoch- und landesverr√§terischer Angriffe am 30. Juni, 1. und 2. Juli 1934 vollzogenen Ma√ünahmen sind als Staatsnotwehr rechtens\\" (\\"The measures taken to clamp down on the treasonous attacks of June 30th, July 1st and 2nd are rightful, due to having been acts of self-defense of the State.\\")wikisource it was decided that the killing of everybody on that list was to be considered lawful and that therefore the police and Attorney Offices were prohibited from investigating and prosecuting anyone for those killings. The lists thus were used by the Ministry and the Gestapo as a referential tool which could be consulted to decide, whether requests of relatives and friends of those killed to be given information on the circumstances of death of their beloved ones, or requests to prosecute those responsible for their killing would be answered in the affirmative (people killed and not mentioned on the Gestapo list) or in the negative (people whose names were to be found on the list). The same applied to requests of other state authorities (especially police departments and Attorney Offices) who inquired at the Ministry of Justice or the Gestapo headquarters whether they should open and or continue investigation of a specific killing that had taken place on the three days from June 30 to July 2. The official list of those killed was first published in 1964 by Heinrich Bennecke (1902‚Äì1972) in the appendix of his book Die Reichswehr und der \\"R√∂hm-Putsch\\".  Estimates of people killed in addition to those on the official list SA-Obergruppenf√ºhrer , chief of the Munich police, 1930; killed during Night of Long Knives Later research by historians has shown that in addition to those listed by the Gestapo a number of others also had been killed. Heinrich Bennecke complemented the names of the city clerk Kuno Kamphausen from Waldenburg and the music critic Willi Schmid to his reprint of the official Gestapo list, whereupon he concluded that at least 85 people were killed during the purge. Later, Hans G√ºnther Richardi, in his study on the Dachau concentration camp, added the names of four inmates of Dachau (lawyer Julius Adler (1882‚Äì1934), worker Erich Gans (1908‚Äì1934), Walter H√§bich and worker Adam Hereth (1897-1934)), claiming they were murdered by the SS during the purge. In 1993 Otto Gritschneder published a book on the post‚ÄìWorld War II prosecution of those involved in the killings which lists 90 names of people killed (adding the doctor and R√∂hm associate Karl G√ºnther Heimsoth to the list).:de:Otto Gritschneder: Der F√ºhrer hat sie zum Tode verurteilt, Munich 1993, . Richard J. Evans states that at least 85 people were killed and more than 1000 were arrested. Ian Kershaw also cites the number of deaths at 85. Kershaw notes that \\"some estimates...put the total number killed at between 150 and 200.\\" William L. Shirer writes in his Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, that \\"The White Book of the Purge, published by √©migr√©s in Paris claims 401 deaths, but lists only 116 of them. At the 1957 trial in Munich the figure 'more than 1,000' was used.\\" Both of those figures are much higher than the ones most historians of the period rely on, and that Shirer himself was not necessarily citing the figures as accurate, but was simply relaying them in his book. The most recent study on the matter lists by name 89 people who were definitely killed, as well as two other cases of whom it is unclear whether they were murdered during the events or slightly earlier or later.Rainer Orth: Der SD-Mann Johannes Schmidt.

It was founded in 1897. ==The 1890s== St Andrew's Church Clifton Road, Worthing was consecrated on Trinity Sunday, 27 May 1888. However it was to be a further nine years before the school was opened. Lady Loder, of Beach House, bought the land north of the church in 1893, at a cost of ¬£580, for a school. However, plans were delayed for 2 years due to an epidemic of typhoid. The plans were finally approved in February 1895. The committee consisted of the Vicar, Mrs. Crowther-Benyon, Lady Loder, Mr Wedd and others. In 1896 an appeal was launched for funds and the school finally opened its doors to pupils on 25 January 1897 at the cost of ¬£1850. To mark the 10th anniversary of the church, Lady Loder gave a further ¬£500 to the school. Joseph Theakstone was its first head teacher. Mr. Athelston Riley, one of the editors of the English Hymnal, opened the school. The Mayor attended the event and the school hall was the venue for luncheon. The new school's Coat of Arms was (and remains) the 'Saltire' Cross of St Andrew with the motto Nihil Sine Labore (Nothing Without Effort). By 1 February, 128 pupils had registered with there being some free places. Others paid a fee of between 3d and 6d a week. The curriculum included Reading, Writing, Spelling, Poetry, Arithmetic, Scripture, Science, Geography, Shorthand, French, Book keeping, Domestic Economy, Cookery and Singing. In these early days there were girls admitted to the school. Physical Education included swings for the girls, parallel bars for the boys and Swedish Drill had to be performed inside if the weather was bad. 1897 nationally was an important year as it was Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee and it is recorded that the girls made white crosses to smarten up their school clothes. The school continued to grow with 205 pupils on the register by April. Blue serge caps with a silken badge were now on sale for 11d. Senior staff received ¬£80 pa while pupil teachers' only ¬£12 pa. By the end of this year H.M.I. wrote, \\"This is in all respects - discipline, teaching, appliances - a thoroughly good school. But I am inclined to think that too many subjects are placed on the timetable.\\" ==The 1900s== From the school logs we can see that on 20 June 1900 the Headmaster, Robert Parkinson, wrote, \\"During the last fortnight I have examined the school. Standard I, II are in excellent order. Standard III, IV are under one teacher and very crowded and consequently work is not thorough. Standard V, VI lack brightness. The work is well taught but the tone is low. Standard VI arithmetic is very weak\\". The Worthing Observer of Sunday 31 March 1901 advertised \\"Evening Classes\\" of Cookery, Dressmaking, Home Nursing and Ambulance work. Earlier in this month the Medical Officer of Health closed the school for 3 weeks due to a measles epidemic. By 1907 the school had 281 senior pupils and 76 infants of whom Miss L. Dunston was in charge with Mr Parkinson in overall charge as Head. ==The 1910s== Music and drama featured prominently in the early history of the school and in January 1913 an evening of entertainment was arranged to raise money for the Sports Fund. Staff and pupils took part in a varied programme. In 1914 Mr. Parkinson sold off superfluous land and enlarged the school to include 6 classrooms and 2 cloakrooms. Princess Marie Louise of Schleswig-Holstein opened these extensions in September of this year. ==1920s== On 16 April 1928 the school became a Church Senior Boys School. The girls were transferred to Davison School and the remaining 171 boys were placed in 4 forms according to ability in English and Arithmetic. Also in this year Mr. Desborough became head and Miss Dunston retired after 30 years service. Gardening was added to the curriculum in 1929 with crops being grown in the grounds of the Vicarage in Rectory Road and at No. 6 Southey Road ==1930s== In 1931 the infant classes were transferred to Christ Church and Holy Trinity Schools. The late 1930s saw the outbreak of war and in the autumn of 1938 the school was temporarily closed so that staff could distribute gas masks to the people of Worthing. Also the Music and PT teacher Derrick Cressey was called up and the 7 classes had to be reduced to 6. The autumn term was delayed as the school was used to billet London evacuees. ==The 1940s== An appeal had been launched in 1939 to raise ¬£2,500 for extensions to the school and a new science and woodwork room was opened in June 1940 by The Bishop of Lewes. 63 boys and 3 staff were evacuated to Nottinghamshire in 1941. In February 1943 the school log shows that there was machine gunning over the playground and bombs exploding nearby. On 8 and 9 May 1945 a National Holiday to celebrate the surrender of Germany was held. A week later the Cigarette Fund realised ¬£8-0-4 which meant that 160 tins of cigarettes could be dispatched to forces by the Overseas League. During the war staff supervised boys picking peas at Roundstone Farm to improve productivity. Also the war claimed the lives of 30 old boys. By the end of the war the Headmaster Mr Parrit had less than 100 pupils and due to austerity very little was done to celebrate the schools 50th birthday in 1947. In 1948 the school had its first open day in 10 years. The Mayor attended and presented cups and prizes. ==1950s== Sussex Road School was appropriated as temporary additional accommodation as the school was fully subscribed. A new floor was laid in the hall in 1954 and the Parent Staff Association founded in 1956. September 1958 saw 35 St. Andrew's boys taking part in extended courses to attempt their GCEs. St Andrew's championed the newly established the Duke of Edinburgh's Award Scheme. ==1960s== St. Andrew's was now on spread over three sites. To remedy this a new school was built in Sackville Road. The foundation stone was laid by the Mayor, Mrs. M I Keele, on 14 May 1963 and dedicated by the Bishop of Chichester The Right Reverend Roger P. Wilson. The Parent Staff Association raised ¬£1000 for an organ to be installed in the new school in keeping with its association with St. Andrew's Church. They also raised another ¬£700 for a statue of St. Andrew to be placed at the school's main entrance. The school on Sackville Road opened at a cost of ¬£203,000 (75s 10d per sq ft). Keith Andrew Ltd of Worthing built it and a 9-foot bronze cross was erected under the instruction of the architect Mr. Claridge in keeping with the school's Christian ethos. Pupils helped pack the removal vans and personally carried books to the new site. The library housed some 5,500 books. ==1970s== In August 1970 plans to demolish the old Clifton Road School and replace it with flats were raised, and ultimately carried out. 1972 saw the 75th anniversary celebrations along with the official opening and dedication of the new arts centre by the Right Reverend Simon Phipps, Bishop of Horsham. Mr Robin Ellmore (Woodwork) retired after 42 years as did Mr George Robotham, (Maths) after 17 years. Mr John Peckham was appointed Headmaster in September 1975 and Deputy. ==1980s== The Chair of Governors, Rev. John Cotton, opened a new Science Lab, at a cost of ¬£15,000, at a short ceremony with a blessing in September 1984 while in September 1986 the Gym was extended. Brighton and Hove Albion Manager, Alan Mullery opened this. After 10 years of waiting the 3rd Worthing Scout Group finally saw the start of their building work of their new Group Headquarters in the grounds of the school. This also gave the school a hall to use for drama. ==The 1990s== On 3 October 1990 the Bishop of Chichester celebrates 25 years on the Sackville Road site. More expansion, this time a ¬£500,000 Sports Hall. This was ready for use in November 1991. Also in 1990 the go ahead was given in December for two new first schools to be built in the Worthing area. One of which, Springfields, is to be built in the grounds of St. Andrew's. St. Andrew's won the schools' County Cricket Trophy in 1993. A single storey extension was started in May 1995 in the form of a new technology centre costing ¬£177,000. It was ready for use in November of the same year. 1996 saw the retirement of Head teacher, Mr. Peter Stewart after 13 years. On 8 March 1997 St. Andrew's Church of England School for Boys was 100 years old and in September of the same year a new Head Teacher was appointed, Mr. Steve Jewell. In September 1998, St. Andrew's won the Potter Bailey Cricket Trophy after the final against The Angmering School. ==The 2000s== A fibreglass statue of St. Andrew casting a fishing net was located in the pond at the school main entrance. This was removed in 2006 because it had deteriorated beyond economic repair. As a replacement and in order to continue to reinforce the Christian ethos of the school, the pupils have designed and constructed some mosaic plaques and other sculptures which are displayed around the outside of the building. In 2005 the school's rugby team won the Worthing & District trophy for the first and only time in the school's history, beating Angmering 12-10 in the final. Accordingly to a local paper, the victory was made even more impressive by the fact that only two of the St Andrew's rugby team played rugby regularly outside of school. A synthetic turf pitch was built and opened in 2005. Student Voice group \\"Make Learning Better\\" was created. The Chapel was extended into the indoor pond in 2008 to accommodate the new year 7 pupils. In April 2009, Mr Steve Jewell, Headmaster, left to become the Principal at Littlehampton Academy. On 20 April 2009 Steve Mercer had taken over as Headteacher of the school. ==2010s== During the 2009-10 summer holiday break, the school began a 'facelift' project, including a complete refurbishment of the school canteen and new lighting/fans in the main hall. 2010 saw another student voice created in addition to MLB, \\"SUSTAIN\\". In 2011 an outdoor classroom was built by SUSTAIN and opened in 2012. Mr. Dykes, a long running science teacher at the school, died from lung cancer in June 2012. The school experienced an afternoon closure on the 3rd of July because staff attended the funeral. The school completed a building project in 2012 which added a new reception area, offices and meeting rooms. Further to this, another building project took place, completed in 2016 to add more classrooms to the school. A significant investment by the Local Authority funded the building of a new Technology Block and a new Arts block together with new catering facilities Following a grading of 3 from Ofsted (unsatisfactory) in 2013 the school underwent staffing changes. Ofsted returned to the school following these changes and upgraded the school to the category 'Good' shortly after an inspection under SIAMS - Section 48 gave the school 'Good with Outstanding features.' Steve Mercer left the school abruptly in February 2017 and was replaced by Ian Straw in an interim capacity. In 2018 Ian Straw resigned to accept a headship at The Forest School in Horsham. He was replaced by Louise Welcome who became the school's first ever female headteacher. In 2020 Louise Welcome resigned citing personal reasons. In July 2020, West Sussex County Council announced proposals to alter St Andrew's from a single sex boys‚Äô school to a co-educational school from September 2021 entry. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Official school website Category:Buildings and structures in Worthing Category:Secondary schools in West Sussex Category:Church of England secondary schools in the Diocese of Chichester Category:Educational institutions established in 1897 Category:1897 establishments in England Category:Voluntary aided schools in England ","title":"St Andrew's High School, Worthing"},{"id":"12368340","text":"Berwald is a surname.

(b) An ohmic cantilever RF MEMS switch, connected in series to a microstrip line. A radio-frequency microelectromechanical system (RFMEMS) is a microelectromechanical system with electronic components comprising moving sub-millimeter-sized parts that provide radio-frequency (RF) functionality. RF functionality can be implemented using a variety of RF technologies. Besides RF MEMS technology, III-V compound semiconductor (GaAs, GaN, InP, InSb), ferrite, ferroelectric, silicon-based semiconductor (RF CMOS, SiC and SiGe), and vacuum tube technology are available to the RF designer. Each of the RF technologies offers a distinct trade-off between cost, frequency, gain, large-scale integration, lifetime, linearity, noise figure, packaging, power handling, power consumption, reliability, ruggedness, size, supply voltage, switching time and weight. == Components == There are various types of RF MEMS components, such as CMOS integrable RF MEMS resonators and self-sustained oscillators with small form factor and low phase noise, RF MEMS tunable inductors, and RF MEMS switches, switched capacitors and varactors.  Switches, switched capacitors and varactors  The components discussed in this article are based on RF MEMS switches, switched capacitors and varactors. These components can be used instead of FET and HEMT switches (FET and HEMT transistors in common gate configuration), and PIN diodes. RF MEMS switches, switched capacitors and varactors are classified by actuation method (electrostatic, electrothermal, magnetostatic, piezoelectric), by axis of deflection (lateral, vertical), by circuit configuration (series, shunt), by clamp configuration (cantilever, fixed-fixed beam), or by contact interface (capacitive, ohmic). Electrostatically-actuated RF MEMS components offer low insertion loss and high isolation, linearity, power handling and Q factor, do not consume power, but require a high control voltage and hermetic single-chip packaging (thin film capping, LCP or LTCC packaging) or wafer-level packaging (anodic or glass frit wafer bonding).

Theory Tech., vol. 51, no. 1, pp. 305‚Äì308, Jan. 2003 A capacitive fixed-fixed beam RF MEMS switch, as shown in Fig. 1(a), is in essence a micro-machined capacitor with a moving top electrode, which is the beam. It is generally connected in shunt with the transmission line and used in X- to W-band (77 GHz and 94 GHz) RF MEMS components. An ohmic cantilever RF MEMS switch, as shown in Fig. 1(b), is capacitive in the up-state, but makes an ohmic contact in the down-state. It is generally connected in series with the transmission line and is used in DC to the Ka-band components. From an electromechanical perspective, the components behave like a damped mass-spring system, actuated by an electrostatic force. The spring constant is a function of the dimensions of the beam, as well as the Young's modulus, the residual stress and the Poisson ratio of the beam material. The electrostatic force is a function of the capacitance and the bias voltage. Knowledge of the spring constant allows for hand calculation of the pull-in voltage, which is the bias voltage necessary to pull-in the beam, whereas knowledge of the spring constant and the mass allows for hand calculation of the switching time. From an RF perspective, the components behave like a series RLC circuit with negligible resistance and inductance. The up- and down-state capacitance are in the order of 50 fF and 1.2 pF, which are functional values for millimeter- wave circuit design. Switches typically have a capacitance ratio of 30 or higher, while switched capacitors and varactors have a capacitance ratio of about 1.2 to 10. The loaded Q factor is between 20 and 50 in the X-, Ku- and Ka-band.M. P. J. Tiggelman, K. Reimann, F. Van Rijs, J. Schmitz, and R. J. E. Hueting, \\"On the trade-off between quality factor and tuning ratio in tunable high-frequency capacitors,\\" IEEE Trans. El. Dev.56(9) pp. 1218-2136 (2009). RF MEMS switched capacitors are capacitive fixed-fixed beam switches with a low capacitance ratio. RF MEMS varactors are capacitive fixed-fixed beam switches which are biased below pull-in voltage. Other examples of RF MEMS switches are ohmic cantilever switches, and capacitive single pole N throw (SPNT) switches based on the axial gap wobble motor.S. Pranonsatit, A. S. Holmes, I. D. Robertson and S. Lucyszyn: \\"Single-Pole Eight-Throw RF MEMS Rotary Switch,\\" IEEE/ASME J. Microelectromech. Syst., vol. 15, no. 6, pp. 1735-1744, Dec. 2006 == Biasing == RF MEMS components are biased electrostatically using a bipolar NRZ drive voltage, as shown in Fig. 2, in order to avoid dielectric chargingJ. R. Reid and R. T. Webster: \\"Measurements of Charging in Capacitive Microelectromechanical Switches,\\" Electronics Letters, vol. 38, no. 24, pp. 1544-1545, Nov. 2002 and to increase the lifetime of the device. Dielectric charges exert a permanent electrostatic force on the beam. The use of a bipolar NRZ drive voltage instead of a DC drive voltage avoids dielectric charging whereas the electrostatic force exerted on the beam is maintained, because the electrostatic force varies quadratically with the DC drive voltage. Electrostatic biasing implies no current flow, allowing high- resistivity bias lines to be used instead of RF chokes. Fig. 2: Electrostatic biasing of a capacitive fixed-fixed beam RF MEMS switch, switched capacitor or varactor. == Packaging == RF MEMS components are fragile and require wafer level packaging or single chip packaging which allow for hermetic cavity sealing. A cavity is required to allow movement, whereas hermeticity is required to prevent cancellation of the spring force by the Van der Waals force exerted by water droplets and other contaminants on the beam. RF MEMS switches, switched capacitors and varactors can be packaged using wafer level packaging. Large monolithic RF MEMS filters, phase shifters, and tunable matching networks require single chip packaging. Wafer-level packaging is implemented before wafer dicing, as shown in Fig. 3(a), and is based on anodic, metal diffusion, metal eutectic, glass frit, polymer adhesive, and silicon fusion wafer bonding. The selection of a wafer-level packaging technique is based on balancing the thermal expansion coefficients of the material layers of the RF MEMS component and those of the substrates to minimize the wafer bow and the residual stress, as well as on alignment and hermeticity requirements. Figures of merit for wafer-level packaging techniques are chip size, hermeticity, processing temperature, (in)tolerance to alignment errors and surface roughness. Anodic and silicon fusion bonding do not require an intermediate layer, but do not tolerate surface roughness. Wafer-level packaging techniques based on a bonding technique with a conductive intermediate layer (conductive split ring) restrict the bandwidth and isolation of the RF MEMS component. The most common wafer-level packaging techniques are based on anodic and glass frit wafer bonding. Wafer-level packaging techniques, enhanced with vertical interconnects, offer the opportunity of three-dimensional integration. Single-chip packaging, as shown in Fig. 3(b), is implemented after wafer dicing, using pre-fabricated ceramic or organic packages, such as LCP injection molded packages or LTCC packages. Pre-fabricated packages require hermetic cavity sealing through clogging, shedding, soldering or welding. Figures of merit for single-chip packaging techniques are chip size, hermeticity, and processing temperature. Fig. 3: (a) Wafer-level packaging. (b) Single chip packaging of an ohmic cantilever RF MEMS switch. == Microfabrication == An RF MEMS fabrication process is based on surface micromachining techniques, and allows for integration of SiCr or TaN thin film resistors (TFR), metal-air-metal (MAM) capacitors, metal-insulator- metal (MIM) capacitors, and RF MEMS components. An RF MEMS fabrication process can be realized on a variety of wafers: III-V compound semi-insulating, borosilicate glass, fused silica (quartz), LCP, sapphire, and passivated silicon wafers. As shown in Fig. 4, RF MEMS components can be fabricated in class 100 clean rooms using 6 to 8 optical lithography steps with a 5 Œºm contact alignment error, whereas state-of-the-art MMIC and RFIC fabrication processes require 13 to 25 lithography steps. Fig. 4: RF MEMS switch, switched capacitor, or varactor fabrication process As outlined in Fig. 4, the essential microfabrication steps are: * Deposition of the bias lines (Fig. 4, step 1) * Deposition of the electrode layer (Fig. 4, step 2) * Deposition of the dielectric layer (Fig. 4, step 3) * Deposition of the sacrificial spacer (Fig. 4, step 4) * Deposition of seed layer and subsequent electroplating (Fig. 4, step 5) * Beam patterning, release and critical point drying (Fig. 4, step 6) With the exception of the removal of the sacrificial spacer, which requires critical point drying, the fabrication steps are similar to CMOS fabrication process steps. RF MEMS fabrication processes, unlike BST or PZT ferroelectric and MMIC fabrication processes, do not require electron beam lithography, MBE, or MOCVD. == Reliability == Contact interface degradation poses a reliability issue for ohmic cantilever RF MEMS switches, whereas dielectric charging beam stiction,Samuel Mell√©, Student Member IEEE, David De Conto, David Dubuc, Member IEEE, Katia Grenier, Member IEEE, Olivier Vendier, Jean-Luc Muraro, Jean-Louis Cazaux, Senior Member IEEE, and Robert Plana Member IEEE : Reliability Modeling of Capacitive RF MEMS, IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MICROWAVE THEORY AND TECHNIQUES, VOL. 53, NO. 11, NOVEMBER 2005 as shown in Fig. 5(a), and humidity induced beam stiction, as shown in Fig. 5(b), pose a reliability issue for capacitive fixed-fixed beam RF MEMS switches. Stiction is the inability of the beam to release after removal of the drive voltage. A high contact pressure assures a low-ohmic contact or alleviates dielectric charging induced beam stiction. Commercially available ohmic cantilever RF MEMS switches and capacitive fixed-fixed beam RF MEMS switches have demonstrated lifetimes in excess of 100 billion cycles at 100 mW of RF input power.H. S.

M. Rebeiz: \\"RF MEMS, Theory, Design and Technology,\\" John Wiley & Sons, 2003  Antennas  Polarization and radiation pattern reconfigurability, and frequency tunability, are usually achieved by incorporation of III-V semiconductor components, such as SPST switches or varactor diodes. However, these components can be readily replaced by RF MEMS switches and varactors in order to take advantage of the low insertion loss and high Q factor offered by RF MEMS technology. In addition, RF MEMS components can be integrated monolithically on low-loss dielectric substrates, such as borosilicate glass, fused silica or LCP, whereas III-V compound semi-insulating and passivated silicon substrates are generally lossier and have a higher dielectric constant. A low loss tangent and low dielectric constant are of importance for the efficiency and the bandwidth of the antenna. The prior art includes an RF MEMS frequency tunable fractal antenna for the 0.1‚Äì6 GHz frequency range,D. E.

RF-MEMS?\\"  Filters  RF bandpass filters can be used to increase out-of-band rejection, in case the antenna fails to provide sufficient selectivity. Out-of-band rejection eases the dynamic range requirement on the LNA and the mixer in the light of interference. Off-chip RF bandpass filters based on lumped bulk acoustic wave (BAW), ceramic, SAW, quartz crystal, and FBAR resonators have superseded distributed RF bandpass filters based on transmission line resonators, printed on substrates with low loss tangent, or based on waveguide cavities. Tunable RF bandpass filters offer a significant size reduction over switched RF bandpass filter banks. They can be implemented using III-V semiconducting varactors, BST or PZT ferroelectric and RF MEMS resonators and switches, switched capacitors and varactors, and YIG ferrites. RF MEMS resonators offer the potential of on-chip integration of high-Q resonators and low-loss bandpass filters. The Q factor of RF MEMS resonators is in the order of 100-1000. RF MEMS switch, switched capacitor and varactor technology, offers the tunable filter designer a compelling trade-off between insertion loss, linearity, power consumption, power handling, size, and switching time.R.

Passive subarrays based on RF MEMS phase shifters may be used to lower the amount of T/R modules in an active electronically scanned array. The statement is illustrated with examples in Fig. 6: assume a one-by-eight passive subarray is used for transmit as well as receive, with following characteristics: f = 38 GHz, Gr = Gt = 10 dBi, BW = 2 GHz, Pt = 4 W. The low loss (6.75 ps/dB) and good power handling (500 mW) of the RF MEMS phase shifters allow an EIRP of 40 W and a Gr/T of 0.036 1/K. EIRP, also referred to as the power-aperture product, is the product of the transmit gain, Gt, and the transmit power, Pt. Gr/T is the quotient of the receive gain and the antenna noise temperature. A high EIRP and Gr/T are a prerequisite for long-range detection. The EIRP and Gr/T are a function of the number of antenna elements per subarray and of the maximum scanning angle. The number of antenna elements per subarray should be chosen in order to optimize the EIRP or the EIRP x Gr/T product, as shown in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8. The radar range equation can be used to calculate the maximum range for which targets can be detected with 10 dB of SNR at the input of the receiver. :{\\\\mathrm{R = \\\\sqrt[4]{\\\\frac{\\\\displaystyle {\\\\mathrm{\\\\lambda^2 \\\\, EIRP \\\\, G_R/T \\\\, \\\\sigma}}}{{\\\\mathrm{\\\\displaystyle 64 \\\\, \\\\pi^3 \\\\, k_B \\\\, BW \\\\, SNR}}}}}} in which kB is the Boltzmann constant, Œª is the free-space wavelength, and œÉ is the RCS of the target. Range values are tabulated in Table 1 for following targets: a sphere with a radius, a, of 10 cm (œÉ = œÄ a2), a dihedral corner reflector with facet size, a, of 10 cm (œÉ = 12 a4/Œª2), the rear of a car (œÉ = 20 m2) and for a non-evasive fighter jet (œÉ = 400 m2). {  + Table 1: Maximum Detectable Range (SNR = 10 dB) - ! !

Distributed loaded-line TTD phase shifters, however, can be realized analogously or digitally, and in smaller form factors, which is important at the subarray level. Analog phase shifters are biased through a single bias line, whereas multibit digital phase shifters require a parallel bus along with complex routing schemes at the subarray level. ==References Reading == * S.

She was built to clear minefields in offshore waters. Saunter was laid down on 23 November 1942 by Winslow Marine Railway and Shipbuilding Co., Seattle, Washington, launched on 20 February 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Merle Black, and commissioned on 22 January 1944, Lt. Comdr. James R. Keefer in command. == World War II Pacific Theatre operations == After shakedown, Saunter sailed from San Francisco, California, on 1 April 1944 for Hawaii, and commenced three months of convoy duty between Pearl Harbor, Majuro, Midway Island, and Kwajalein. Between 6 and 15 August, she swept an old United States minefield in the French Frigate Shoals, northwest of Oahu. She arrived at Manus in mid-September and reported to the 7th Fleet for the Leyte invasion. == Searching for survivors == On 20 October, she joined her division, Mine Division 34, off the Leyte beaches for a four-day minesweep of the main transport channel, and then anchored with the transports to provide antiaircraft support. Between 27 and 31 October, she helped search for survivors at the scene of the Battle off Samar, where Rear Admiral Sprague's escort carriers had withstood the attack of a superior Japanese force. For the next month, she carried out local patrols and sweeps in the vicinity of Leyte. == Supporting Philippine Islands Invasion == Saunter participated with her Division in most of the subsequent landings in the Philippines. She carried out pre-invasion sweeps at Ormoc Bay on 6 December; Mindoro Island on 14 December; Lingayen Gulf on 6 January 1945; and Zambales and Subic Bay from 29 through 31 January. During and after the initial troop landings, she helped extend the mineswept areas and provided antisubmarine and antiaircraft protection for the transports anchored off the beaches. == Under attack by kamikaze aircraft == Few mines were encountered, but kamikaze resistance was intense, and, on 7 December, Saunter tried unsuccessfully to control fires aboard one kamikaze victim, . During the Mindoro operation, Saunter briefly went aground on a reef, damaging a propeller. == Straddled by Japanese battery fire == On 13 February Saunter and her division began pre- invasion sweeps in Manila Bay in preparation for the landings at Mariveles and Corregidor. While sweeping off Corregidor on the 14th, the minesweepers came within 5,000 yards of the island and were repeatedly straddled by Japanese fire before supporting ships silenced the enemy's guns. Saunter continued sweeping in Manila Bay through 19 February, and her division earned a Navy Unit Commendation for the period from 14 to 18 February. == Struck by a mine and nearly sunk == On 26 February, Saunter returned to Manila Bay to assist in harbor clearance sweeps. Shortly after noon, she struck a mine which blew a large hole in her bottom. Damage control parties contained the flooding, and the ship was towed back to Subic Bay. A party of officers and men from the USS DYSON DD-572 went aboard the SAUNTER and helped to save her. == Stateside evaluation and decommissioning == She remained there until towed back to the United States, arriving at San Francisco, California, on 15 August. Saunter was decommissioned on 27 October 1945, struck from the Navy list on 13 November 1945, and transferred to the Maritime Commission for disposal on 24 April 1946.

They play in the Provincial Junior Hockey League. ==History== The Sailors were formerly known as the Belmont Bombers, playing their last season as the Bombers in 05-06. Prior to the 06-07 season, they changed their name to the Central Elgin Express. This was done as the team was going to be splitting their home games between Belmont and Port Stanley. During the 07-08 season, the Express played all their home games in Port Stanley, which was formerly home to the Port Stanley Lakers, which became the West Lorne Lakers before leaving the OHA. During the summer of 2008, it was announced that The Central Elgin Express had been sold by Peter North and Bill Walters to a group of four equal owners led by St. Thomas resident Dale J. Howard. The other three owners are Harold Lang, Matt Stolk and Mike Carson. The Sailors were not able to play in 08-09 because the OHA schedule had already been finalized.

The term ex officio is Latin, meaning literally 'from the office', and the sense intended is 'by right of office'; its use dates back to the Roman Republic. According to Robert's Rules of Order the term denotes only how one becomes a member of a body.(RONR) Accordingly, the rights of an ex officio member are exactly the same as other members unless otherwise stated in regulations or bylaws. In some groups ex officio members may frequently abstain from voting. == For profit and nonprofit use == Any ex officio membership (for example, of committees, or of the board) is as defined by the nonprofit association's bylaws or other documents of authority. For example, the bylaws quite often provide that the organization's president will be ex officio a member of all committees, except the nominating committee. ==Governmental examples== Brazil In the Empire of Brazil, some princes became members by right of the Imperial Senate once they turn 25. China According to the Constitution of the Communist Party of China, the General Secretary of the Central Committee must be a member of Politburo Standing Committee.Chapter III Central Organizations of the Party Article 22  Hong Kong  , the Executive Council of Hong Kong is still composed of ex officio members (official members since 1997) and unofficial members (non-official members since 1997). By practice the ex officio members include the secretaries of departments, i.e. the Chief Secretary, the Financial Secretary and the Secretary for Justice. Since 2002 all secretaries of bureaux are also appointed by the Chief Executive to be official members of the Executive Council. But since 2005 the secretaries of bureaux attend only when items on the agenda concern their portfolios. Andorra The President of the French Republic and the Catholic Bishop of Urgell are by virtue of office (ex officio) appointed Co-Princes of Andorra. India The Vice-President of India is ex officio Chairman of Rajya Sabha, the Upper House of the Indian Parliament. The Prime Minister of India is ex officio Chairman of NITI Aayog. Other ex officio members of NITI Aayog are the Minister of Home Affairs, Minister of Finance, Minister of Railways and the Minister of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare.  Philippines  In provincial boards, the provincial presidents of the League of Barangays (villages), Sangguniang Kabataan (youth councils) and of the Philippine Councilors League sit as ex officio board members. In city and municipal councils, the city and municipal presidents of the League of Barangays and the youth councils sit as ex officio councilors. The deputies of local chief executives (vice governors and vice mayors) are ex officio presiding officers of their respective legislatures, but can only vote when there is a tie. In Congress, the presiding officers and their deputies, and the majority and minority leaders are ex officio members of all committees. The chairman on each chamber's committee on rules is the majority leader. The Senate President is the ex officio chairman of Commission on Appointments. In the Judicial and Bar Council, several positions are due to occupying another office. United Kingdom In the House of Lords, the bishops of the five Great Sees of Canterbury, York, London, Durham and Winchester, and the 21 next most senior bishops of the Church of England, are ex officio members, and are entitled to vote just as any other member.  Scotland  The Lord President of the Court of Session is by virtue of office appointed as Lord Justice General of Scotland. As such, he is both head of the judiciary of Scotland, president of the Court of Session (the most senior civil court in Scotland), and president of the High Court of Justiciary (the most senior criminal court in Scotland). United States  Federal government  The United States Vice President, who also serves as President of the Senate, may vote in the Senate on matters decided by a majority vote (as opposed to a three-fifths vote or two-thirds vote), if the votes for passage and rejection are equal. Also the leader of the parties in both houses are ex officio members of the House and Senate intelligence committees. Many committee chairs in the House of Representatives are ex officio members of subcommittees.  Colorado  In most Colorado counties, the county sheriff is elected by the citizens of the county. However, in the City and County of Denver, the mayor of Denver appoints a \\"Manager of Safety\\" who oversees the Department of Safety (including the Fire, Police, and Sheriff Departments) and is the ex officio sheriff of the jurisdiction. Similarly, in the City and County of Broomfield, Colorado, near Denver, the police chief (an appointed position) also acts ex officio as the county sheriff.https://www.broomfield.org/police  New York City  The Speaker of the New York City Council, and its Majority and Minority Leaders, are all ex officio members of each of its committees.

The three British National Insurance Funds hold the contributions of the National Insurance Scheme, set up by the Government of the United Kingdom in 1911. It was reformed in 1948 and assumed broadly its current form in 1975, when the separate National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) and National Insurance (Reserve) Funds were merged with it. In the Beveridge Report this was the basis of a universal insurance system for all British people. \\"first and foremost a plan of insurance ‚Äì of giving in return for contributions benefits up to subsistence levels, as of right and without means test, so that individuals may build freely upon it\\". There are the National Insurance Fund of the United Kingdom, for Great Britain (England and Wales and Scotland), the National Insurance Fund of Northern Ireland, and the Isle of Man National Insurance Fund. ==The United Kingdom (for England, Wales and Scotland only)== The money is held in the National Insurance Fund (NIF), separate from the Consolidated Fund.National Insurance Fund at government- accounting.gov.uk Contributions are not \\"taxes\\" because they are not directly available for general expenditure by the government. The income of the NIF consist of contributions from employees, employers and the self-employed, plus interest on its investments. The NIF are used to pay for social security benefits such as state retirement pensions, but not for the means tested Pension Credit and Tax Credits. National Insurance contributions also provide a small part of the funding for the public healthcare systems in the UK (including the National Health Service in England), but contributions are paid into the funds net of money allocated to the NHS.http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1992/5/section/162/enacted Social Security Administration Act 1992 Thus the NIF do not hold money directed for the general provision of health services in the United Kingdom. The Government determines the total allocation for health each year and the allocation from each class contribution is calculated by the Government actuary. Each year there is a surplus of the order of ¬£2 billion. The Great Britain NIF had a surplus of over ¬£34 billion as at 2005/06, ¬£38 billion in 2006/07 and the Government Actuary's Department forecasts that this surplus will grow to over ¬£114.7 billion by 2012.Social Security Uprating Order 2007 This surplus figure has been revised in recent years due to errors in assumptions by the GAD and now is forecast to be just ¬£30 billion by 2016. The surplus is loaned to the government through the Debt Management Office, which is part of the Commissioners for the Reduction of the National Debt, in Call Notice Deposits (previously invested in gilt-edged securities) and interest on these invested monies is paid to the NIF ‚Äì ¬£1.3 billion in the 2007/08 year. The balance in the National Insurance Funds at the end of each calendar month can be seen on the website of the Debt Management Office. Levels of benefit and contributions are set following the advice of the Government Actuary, who recommends that a prudential balance of two months contribution revenue (about ¬£8 billion) should be kept in the fund. ==See also== * Pension * Frozen pension ==ReferencesExternal links== *2005 Report on the Fund by the National Audit Office. *(United Kingdom)Debt Management Office.

It was released worldwide on September 7, 2007, as the album's fourth single. The song was written by Tawanna Dabney and its producers StarGate. Michael Jackson also received a songwriting credit for the sampling of the line \\"Mama-say, mama-sa, ma-ma-ko- ssa\\" from Jackson's 1983 single \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin\\". Both Rihanna and Jackson were sued by Cameroonian musician Manu Dibango, who asserted that the hook originated in his 1972 song \\"Soul Makossa\\". \\"Don't Stop the Music\\" is a dance track that features rhythmic devices used primarily in hip hop music. Many music journalists praised the sampling of the \\"Mama-say, mama-sa, ma-ma- ko-ssa\\" hook. The song received a number of accolades, including a Grammy Award nomination for Best Dance Recording. \\"Don't Stop the Music\\" reached number one in nine countries, including Australia, France, Germany, and Switzerland. In the UK, it reached number four on the singles chart and it was certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). The single peaked at number three on the US Billboard Hot 100 and number one on the US Billboard Dance Club Songs charts. Certified four times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), as of 2015, it has sold more than 3.7 million copies in the US. Anthony Mandler filmed the song's music video in Prague. In the video, Rihanna and her friends sneak into the back of a candy store that contains a secret club, and she parties with club-goers. The singer performed \\"Don't Stop the Music\\" at the 50th Annual Grammy Awards and the NRJ Music Awards in 2008, and included it on her Good Girl Gone Bad, Last Girl on Earth, Loud and Diamonds World Tour set lists. The American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP) recognized it as one of the most-performed songs of 2009. English recording artist Jamie Cullum released a cover of the song as the second single from his 2009 album The Pursuit, and his version charted in several European countries. ==Development and release== Manu Dibango sued Rihanna and Jackson for using his \\"Mama-say, mama-sa, ma-ma-ko-ssa\\" line without permission. \\"Don't Stop the Music\\" was written and produced by the Norwegian production duo StarGate, with additional songwriting by Tawanna Dabney. Michael Jackson received a songwriting credit for the sampling of the line \\"Mama-say, mama-sa, ma-ma-ko-ssa\\" from his 1983 single \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin\\". Tim Sturges and Phillip Ramos provided additional production for the song. It was recorded at Battery Studios in New York City and Westlake Recording Studios in Los Angeles by Mikkel S. Eriksen and Al Hemberger. Phil Tan and Josh Houghkirk mixed the single, and StarGate provided vocal production and instrumentation. In February 2009, Cameroonian musician Manu Dibango filed a lawsuit claiming that \\"Don't Stop the Music\\" and \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin used the \\"Mama-say, mama-sa, ma-ma-ko-ssa\\" hook without his permission. According to Dibango, the line is from his 1972 single \\"Soul Makossa\\". Agence France-Presse reported that Jackson admitted that he borrowed the line for \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin and settled out of court. When Rihanna asked Jackson in 2007 for permission to sample the line, he allegedly approved the request without contacting Dibango beforehand. Dibango's attorneys brought the case before a court in Paris, demanding ‚Ç¨500,000 in damages and asking for Sony BMG, EMI and Warner Music to be \\"barred from receiving 'mama-say mama-sa'-related income until the matter is resolved\\". The judge ruled that Dibango's claim was inadmissible: a year earlier, a different Paris-area judge had required Universal Music to include Dibango's name in the liner notes of future French releases of \\"Don't Stop the Music\\", and at the time of this earlier court appearance, Dibango had withdrawn legal action, thereby waiving his moral right to seek further damages. \\"Don't Stop the Music\\" was the fourth single from Rihanna's third album, Good Girl Gone Bad (2007). Before its release, two promotional remixes of the song (Solitaire's More Drama and the Wideboys Club Mix) were added to digital outlets in Canada and the United States on August 7, 2007. On September 7, an EP of the single was released via the iTunes Store in some countries including Australia, Italy, New Zealand and Spain. The EP contains the Wideboys Club Mix and instrumental and album versions of the song. That day, \\"Don't Stop the Music\\" was released as a CD single in Germany with the same material as the EP and the song's music video. The following month, it was released as a CD single in France. Def Jam Recordings provided the song to contemporary hit radio stations in the United States on January 15, 2008, and to rhythmic contemporary stations a week later. Nine remixes, including the album version of the song, were released on May 14 to digital outlets in territories including Australia, Germany, New Zealand and Spain. ==Composition== \\"Don't Stop the Music\\" is a four-minute, 27-second dance song, written in the key of F minor in common time, with a moderate tempo of 123 beats per minute. Rihanna's voice ranges from F3 to A4. The syncopated song samples a variety of layered rhythms, with hip hop rhythms and a heavy bass drumbeat predominating. The sampled \\"Mama-say, mama-sa, ma-ma-ko-ssa\\" was added to the arrangement as a complementary throbbing motif. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine described \\"Don't Stop the Music\\" as having a bouncy feel similar to Rihanna's 2006 single \\"SOS\\". According to Fraser McAlpine of BBC's Chart Blog, Rihanna's vocals on the song sound as if she recorded them to a different backing track, \\"then gave them to some nerdy beatmatcher with an extensive collection of dark electro and classic pop.\\" McAlpine compared the verses' vocal melody to that of Aaliyah's single \\"Try Again\\", the chorus to Madonna's \\"La Isla Bonita\\", and the base track to Eric Prydz-style trance music. After the release of Rihanna's single \\"Only Girl (In the World)\\" in 2010, many critics compared its composition and structure to \\"Don't Stop the Music\\". ==Critical reception== \\"Don't Stop the Music\\" was praised for incorporating the hook from Michael Jackson's single, \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin. Music journalists praised the sampling of the \\"Mama-say, mama-sa, ma-ma-ko-ssa\\" hook. For Pitchfork Media's Tom Breihan‚Äîwho characterized \\"Don't Stop the Music\\" as \\"an amazing bit of euroclub insanity combined with synth and bass\\"‚Äîthe hook from Jackson's track smoothly blends into the song's powerful beat. Nick Levine of Digital Spy called \\"Don't Stop the Music\\" \\"brilliant and unwitting\\", and said that it was the best single with a Jackson writing credit since his 1997 \\"Blood on the Dance Floor\\". PopMatters Quentin B. Huff wrote that \\"the Michael Jackson-sampling 'Don't Stop the Music', inspires the type of tail feather shaking you can only produce when you're chanting, 'Mama-say, mama-sa, ma-ma-ko-ssa. McAlpine called Rihanna's vocals \\"emotionally removed, a little distant and naughty, but a smidge melancholy and tearful\\". According to a New York Times reviewer, in \\"Don't Stop the Music\\" Rihanna \\"[found] exuberance in a ... severe techno beat\\". In 2012, Billboard ranked the song 13th on its list of \\"Rihanna's 20 Biggest Billboard Hits\\" of all time; they wrote, \\"we defy you to get the hook from this pounding 2007 dancefloor favorite out of your mind.\\" \\"Don't Stop the Music\\" won the Best International Song award at the 2008 NRJ Music Awards.

The video was digitally released on iTunes on July 26, 2007. It was uploaded on Rihanna's Vevo channel on YouTube on November 21, 2009. In the video, Rihanna and two friends arrive at a nightclub in a yellow taxi and enter a candy store where a boy is standing with his mother. Rihanna tells the boy not to tell anyone where they are going, and the singer and her friends sneak into the back of the store (where there is a secret nightclub entrance). The narrative is intercut with Rihanna singing the song against a wall and dancing in the club. After she enters the club, she checks her makeup in a restroom as she sings. Rihanna returns to the dance floor for the chorus, dancing and singing with her friends. Her fellow club-goers clap along with the sample from \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin. VH1's Christopher Rosa ranked the video 18th on his list of Rihanna's 20 sexiest videos: \\"This dance-by-numbers song gets a facelift with its brisk, energetic video featuring R as the undisputed queen of the clubs\\". ==Live performances== Performing \\"Don't Stop the Music\\" in Zurich during Rihanna's 2010 Last Girl on Earth Tour \\"Don't Stop the Music\\" was the 14th song on the set list of Rihanna's 2007‚Äì2009 Good Girl Gone Bad Tour, her first world tour.

On December 4, 2009 the singer performed on The Release, MySpace Music's urban- music concert series.

She also performed the song at the 2016 MTV Video Music Awards in a medley with \\"Only Girl (In the World)\\", \\"We Found Love\\" and \\"Where Have You Been\\". ==Cover versions== During the sixth season of the dance reality- television series America's Best Dance Crew, the dancers Phunk Phenomenon performed a Charlie Chaplinesque music-hall version of \\"Don't Stop the Music\\". In 2011, the California indie pop duo The Bird and the Bee covered the song and posted it on SoundCloud. South Korean recording artist Hyoyeon, part of the girl group Girls' Generation, covered the song during the group's 2011 tour. Her version was included on their second live album, 2011 Girls' Generation Tour, which was released on April 11, 2013. In October 2011 Rihanna joined L.A. Reid at his home in the Hamptons to help him judge male contestants for the first season of the American version of The X Factor, where contestant Philip Lomax performed a stripped-down version of \\"Don't Stop the Music\\" for Rihanna and Reid. The song was performed by the Treblemakers in the 2012 film Pitch Perfect, and was included on its soundtrack. Jamie Cullum version English singer and songwriter Jamie Cullum covered \\"Don't Stop the Music\\" on his 2009 album, The Pursuit. Produced by Martin Terefe, the song was digitally released as the second single from the album on January 25, 2010. Cullum's version substituted the original's electro-house groove with a \\"sinuous\\" acoustic bass and \\"brushed\\" drumming. His rendition is in the key of A minor and set in common time at 100 beats per minute, and his voice ranges from C4 to F5. According to PopMatters Will Layman, the piano builds the groove from soft to loud (a technique used by Herbie Hancock during the 1960s). Adrian Edwards of BBC Music wrote that Cullum's version of \\"Don't Stop the Music\\" is one of the best songs on The Pursuit, and that \\"the novel production techniques and his broken-voiced pleading to his girl on the dance floor would blend well in any night club with strobe lighting and the clink of glasses at the bar.\\" Cullum's version peaked at number two on the Ultratip chart in Belgium, number 28 in the Netherlands and number 58 in Germany. A music video for the song was released on December 2, 2009 on Cullum's YouTube Vevo channel.

The Komnenian (also spelled Comnenian) period comprises the reigns of five emperors, Alexios I, John II, Manuel I, Alexios II and Andronikos I. It was a period of sustained, though ultimately incomplete, restoration of the military, territorial, economic and political position of the Byzantine Empire. Byzantium under the Komnenoi played a key role in the history of the Crusades in the Holy Land, while also exerting enormous cultural and political influence in Europe, the Near East, and the lands around the Mediterranean Sea. The Komnenian emperors, particularly John and Manuel, exerted great influence over the Crusader states of Outremer, whilst Alexios I played a key role in the course of the First Crusade, which he helped bring about. Moreover, it was during the Komnenian period that contact between Byzantium and the 'Latin' Christian West, including the Crusader states, was at its most crucial stage. Venetian and other Italian traders became resident in Constantinople and the empire in large numbers (60‚Äì80,000 'Latins' in Constantinople alone), and their presence together with the numerous Latin mercenaries who were employed by Manuel in particular helped to spread Byzantine technology, art, literature and culture throughout the Roman Catholic west. Above all, the cultural impact of Byzantine art on the west at this period was enormous and of long lasting significance. The Komnenoi also made a significant contribution to the history of Asia Minor. By reconquering much of the region, the Komnenoi set back the advance of the Turks in Anatolia by more than two centuries. In the process, they planted the foundations of the Byzantine successor states of Nicaea, Epirus and Trebizond. Meanwhile, their extensive programme of fortifications has left an enduring mark upon the Anatolian landscape, which can still be appreciated today.C. Foss & D. Winfield, Byzantine fortifications, an introduction ==Crisis and fragmentation== The Komnenian era was born out of a period of great difficulty and strife for the Byzantine Empire. Following a period of relative success and expansion under the Macedonian dynasty (c. 867‚Äìc. 1054), Byzantium experienced several decades of stagnation and decline, which culminated in a vast deterioration in the military, territorial, economic and political situation of the Byzantine Empire by the accession of Alexios I Komnenos in 1081. The problems the empire faced were partially caused by the growing influence and power of the aristocracy, which weakened the empire's military structure by undermining the theme system that trained and administered its armies. Beginning with the death of the successful soldier-emperor Basil II in 1025, a long series of weak rulers had disbanded the large armies which had been defending the eastern provinces from attack; instead, gold was stockpiled in Constantinople, ostensibly in order to hire mercenaries should troubles arise.Haldon, John, Byzantium at War: AD 600‚Äì1453. In fact, most of the money was given away in the form of gifts to favourites of the emperor, extravagant court banquets, and luxuries for the imperial family.Norwich, John, A short history of Byzantium Meanwhile, the remnants of the once-formidable armed forces were allowed to decay, to the point where they were no longer capable of functioning as an army. Elderly men with ill- maintained equipment mixed with new recruits who had never participated in a training exercise. Nikephoros III Botaniates, Byzantine emperor from 1078 to 1081. The simultaneous arrival of aggressive new enemies ‚Äì Turks in the east and Normans in the west ‚Äì was another contributory factor. In 1040, the Normans, originally landless mercenaries from northern parts of Europe in search of plunder, began attacking Byzantine strongholds in southern Italy. In order to deal with them, a mixed force of mercenaries and conscripts under the formidable George Maniakes was sent to Italy in 1042. Maniakes and his army conducted a brutally successful campaign, but before it could be concluded he was recalled to Constantinople. Angered by a series of outrages against his wife and property by one of his rivals, he was proclaimed emperor by his troops, and led them across the Adriatic to victory against a loyalist army. However, a mortal wound led to his death shortly afterwards. With opposition thus absent in the Balkans, the Normans were able to complete the expulsion of the Byzantines from Italy by 1071. Despite the seriousness of this loss, it was in Asia Minor that the empire's greatest disaster would take place. The Seljuk Turks, although mainly concerned with defeating Egypt under the Fatimids, nevertheless conducted a series of damaging raids into Armenia and eastern Anatolia ‚Äì the main recruiting ground for Byzantine armies. With imperial armies weakened by years of insufficient funding and civil warfare, Emperor Romanos Diogenes realised that a time of re-structuring and re- equipment was necessary. Consequently, he attempted to lead a defensive campaign in the east until his forces had recovered enough to defeat the Seljuks. However, he suffered a surprise defeat at the hands of Alp Arslan (Sultan of the Seljuk Turks) at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071. Romanos was captured, and although the Sultan's peace terms were fairly lenient, the battle in the long term resulted in the total loss of Byzantine Anatolia. On his release, Romanos found that his enemies had conspired against him to place their own candidate on the throne in his absence. After two defeats in battle against the rebels, Romanos surrendered and suffered a horrific death by torture. The new ruler, Michael Doukas, refused to honour the treaty that had been signed by Romanos. In response, the Turks began to move into Anatolia in 1073; the collapse of the old defensive system meant that they met no opposition. To make matters worse, chaos reigned as the empire's remaining resources were squandered in a series of disastrous civil wars. Thousands of Turkoman tribesmen crossed the unguarded frontier and moved into Anatolia. By 1080, an area of had been lost to the empire. ==Alexios I Komnenos== The Byzantine Empire at the accession of Alexios I Komnenos, c. 1081\\\\. After Manzikert, a partial recovery was made possible due to the efforts of the Komnenian dynasty. This is sometimes referred to as the Komnenian restoration.Haldon, John, The Byzantine Wars. The first emperor of this royal line was Alexios I Komnenos (whose life and policies would be described by his daughter Anna Komnene in the Alexiad). Alexios's long reign of nearly 37 years was full of struggle. At his accession in 1081, the Byzantine Empire was in chaos after a prolonged period of civil war resulting from the defeat at Manzikert.Kean, Roger, Forgotten Power ‚Äî Byzantium ‚Äî Bulwark of Christianity At the very outset of his reign, Alexios had to meet the formidable threat of the Normans under Robert Guiscard and his son Bohemond of Taranto, who took Dyrrhachium and Corfu, and laid siege to Larissa in Thessaly (see Battle of Dyrrhachium). Alexios led his forces in person against the Normans, yet despite his best efforts his army was destroyed in the field. Alexios himself was wounded, but the death of Robert Guiscard in 1085 led to the Norman danger receding for a time. However, Alexios's problems were only just beginning. At a time when the Emperor urgently needed to raise as much revenue as possible from his shattered empire, taxation and the economy were in complete disarray. Inflation was spiralling out of control, the coinage was heavily debased, the fiscal system was confused (there were six different nomismata in circulation), and the imperial treasury was empty. In desperation, Alexios had been forced to finance his campaign against the Normans by using the wealth of the Eastern Orthodox Church, which had been put at his disposal by the Patriarch of Constantinople.Angold, Michael, The Byzantine Empire 1025‚Äì1204. This electrum histamenon was struck by Alexios during his war against Robert Guiscard. The catastrophic financial situation of the Empire after 1071 had led to large-scale debasement of its coinage. In 1087, Alexios faced a new invasion. This time the invaders consisted of a horde of 80,000 Pechenegs from north of the Danube, and they were heading for Constantinople. Without enough troops to repel this new threat, Alexios used diplomacy to achieve a victory against the odds. Having bribed the Cumans, another barbarian tribe, to come to his aid, he advanced against the Pechenegs, who were caught by surprise and annihilated at the Battle of Levounion on 28 April 1091. With stability at last achieved in the west, Alexios now had a chance to begin solving his severe economic difficulties and the disintegration of the empire's traditional defences. In order to reestablish the army, Alexios began to build a new force on the basis of feudal grants (pr√≥niai) and prepared to advance against the Seljuks, who had conquered Asia Minor and were now established at Nicaea.Birkenmeier, J, The development of the Komnenian army, 1081‚Äì1180 Despite his improvements, Alexios did not have enough manpower to recover the lost territories in Asia Minor. Having been impressed by the abilities of the Norman cavalry at Dyrrhachium, he sent ambassadors west to ask for reinforcements from Europe. This mission was deftly accomplished ‚Äì at the Council of Piacenza in 1095, Pope Urban II was impressed by Alexios's appeal for help, which spoke of the suffering of the Christians of the east and hinted at a possible union of the eastern and western churches. Pope Urban was concerned with increasing restlessness of the martial nobility in Western Europe, who, currently deprived of major enemies, were causing chaos throughout the countryside. Alexios's appeal offered a means not only to redirect the energy of the knights to benefit the Church, but also to consolidate the authority of the Pope over all Christendom and to gain the east for the See of Rome.Harris, Jonathon, Byzantium and the Crusades First Crusade Medieval manuscript depicting the Capture of Jerusalem during the First Crusade. On 27 November 1095, Urban II called together the Council of Clermont in France. There, amid a crowd of thousands who had come to hear his words, he urged all present to take up arms under the banner of the Cross and launch a holy war to recover Jerusalem and the east from the 'infidel' Muslims. Indulgences were to be granted to all those who took part in the great enterprise. Many promised to carry out the Pope's command, and word of the Crusade soon spread across western Europe. Alexios had anticipated help in the form of mercenary forces from the West, and was totally unprepared for the immense and undisciplined hosts which soon arrived, to his consternation and embarrassment. The first group, under Peter the Hermit, he sent to Asia Minor, ordering them to stay close to the coast and await reinforcements. However, the unruly crusaders refused to listen and began looting and pillaging the local Christian inhabitants. As they marched on Nicaea in 1096, they were caught by the Turks and massacred almost to the man. The second, \\"official\\" host of knights, led by Godfrey of Bouillon, Alexios also sent into Asia, promising to supply them with provisions in return for an oath of loyalty. They were accompanied by the Byzantine general Tatikios. By their victories, Alexios was able to recover for the Byzantine Empire a number of important cities and islands: Nicaea, Chios, Rhodes, Smyrna, Ephesus, Philadelphia, Sardis, and in fact much of western Asia Minor (1097‚Äì1099). This is ascribed by his daughter Anna to his policy and diplomacy, but good relations were not to last. The crusaders believed their oaths were made invalid when Alexios did not help them during the siege of Antioch (he had in fact set out on the road to Antioch, but had been persuaded to turn back by Stephen of Blois, who assured him that all was lost and that the expedition had already failed). Bohemund, who had set himself up as Prince of Antioch, briefly went to war with Alexios, but agreed to become Alexios's vassal under the Treaty of Devol in 1108. Recovery Despite his many successes, during the last twenty years of his life Alexios lost much of his popularity. This was largely due to the harsh measures he was forced to take in order to save the embattled empire. Conscription was introduced, causing resentment among the peasantry, despite the pressing need for new recruits to the imperial army. In order to restore the imperial treasury, Alexios took measures to tax the aristocracy heavily; he also cancelled many of the exemptions from taxation that the church had previously enjoyed. In order to ensure that all taxes were paid in full, and to halt the cycle of debasement and inflation, he completely reformed the coinage, issuing a new gold hyperpyron (highly refined) coin for the purpose. By 1109, he had managed to restore order by working out a proper rate of exchange for the whole coinage. His new hyperpyron would be the standard Byzantine coin for the next two hundred years. The final years of Alexios's reign were marked by persecution of the followers of the Paulician and Bogomil heresies‚Äîone of his last acts was to burn at the stake the Bogomil leader, Basil the Physician, with whom he had engaged in a theological controversy; by renewed struggles with the Turks (1110‚Äì1117); and by anxieties as to the succession, which his wife Irene wished to alter in favour of her daughter Anna's husband Nikephorus Bryennios, for whose benefit the special title panhypersebastos (\\"honored above all\\") was created. This intrigue disturbed even his dying hours. Nevertheless, despite the unpopularity of some of his measures, Alexios's efforts had been vital to the survival of the empire. Financially and militarily bankrupt, and facing wave after wave of foreign invasion, the empire he inherited had been on the point of collapse. His long struggle to protect and restore the strength of the empire had been exhausting, but Alexios's successors inherited a viable state with both the internal stability and the military and financial resources, to expand in the future. ==Restoration under John II Komnenos== Emperor John II Komnenos. During his reign (1118‚Äì1143) he earned near universal respect, even from the Crusaders, for his courage, dedication and piety. Alexios's son John II Komnenos succeeded him in 1118, and was to rule until 1143. On account of his mild and just reign, he has been called the Byzantine Marcus Aurelius. John was unusual for his lack of cruelty‚Äîdespite his long reign, he never had anyone killed or blinded. He was loved by his subjects, who gave him the name 'John the Good'. He was also an energetic campaigner, spending much of his life in army camps and personally supervising sieges. During John's reign, Byzantium faced many difficulties: enemies confronted the empire on all sides. An invasion of nomadic horsemen from the north threatened Byzantine control in the Balkans, and the Turks were harassing Byzantine territory in Asia Minor. However, John soon proved himself just as determined and energetic as his predecessor. At the Battle of Beroia, John personally led the imperial armies against the Pecheneg invaders. With the aid of the emperor's elite troops, the Varangian Guard, the tribal horsemen were decisively crushed. The emperor's victory was so emphatic that the Pechenegs soon disappeared as an independent people. John's marriage to the Hungarian princess Piroska involved him in the dynastic struggles of the Kingdom of Hungary. In giving asylum to √Ålmos, a blinded claimant to the Hungarian throne, John aroused the suspicion of the Hungarians. The Hungarians, led by Stephen II, then invaded Byzantium's Balkan provinces in 1127, with hostilities lasting until 1129Angold, p. 154 The Hungarians attacked Belgrade, Nish and Sofia; John, who was near Philippopolis in Thrace, counterattacked, supported by a naval flotilla operating on the Danube.Choniates, p. 11 After a challenging campaign, the details of which are obscure, the emperor managed to defeat the Hungarians and their Serbian allies at the fortress of Haram or Chramon, which is the modern Nova Palanka.Kinnamos, p. 18 Following this the Hungarians renewed hostilities by attacking Braniƒçevo, which was immediately rebuilt by John. Further Byzantine military successes, Choniates mentions several engagements, resulted in a restoration of peace. The Danube frontier had been definitively secured.Choniates, pp. 11-12 John was then able to concentrate on Asia Minor, which became the focus of his attention for most of his reign. The Turks were pressing forward against the Byzantine frontier, and John was determined to drive them back. Thanks to John's energetic campaigning, Turkish attempts at expansion in Asia Minor were halted, and John prepared to take the fight to the enemy. In order to restore the region to Byzantine control, John led a series of campaigns against the Turks, one of which resulted in the reconquest of the ancestral home of the Komneni at Kastamonu. He quickly earned a formidable reputation as a wall-breaker, taking stronghold after stronghold from his enemies. Regions which had been lost to the empire since Manzikert were recovered and garrisoned. Yet resistance, particularly from the Danishmends of the north-east, was strong, and the difficult nature of holding down the new conquests is illustrated by the fact that Kastamonu was recaptured by the Turks whilst John was back in Constantinople celebrating its return to Byzantine rule. John persevered, and Kastamonu soon changed hands once more. He advanced into north-eastern Anatolia, provoking the Turks to attack his army. Unlike Romanos Diogenes, John's forces were able to maintain their cohesion, and the Turkish attempt to inflict a second Manzikert on the emperor's army backfired when the Sultan, discredited by his failure, was murdered by his own people. John, like Basil II before him, was a slow but steady campaigner. His armies made careful, measured gains over time, rarely exposing themselves to excessive risks, but nevertheless advancing inexorably towards their objectives. However, the Turks were resilient, and they did not allow themselves to be decisively defeated in any one engagement. They knew that it was difficult for the emperor to remain in one theatre of war for a long time, as events elsewhere often intervened that required his attention. John consolidated his conquests and the existing Byzantine holdings in Asia by the building of a series of forts. Historian Paul Magdalino explains this process in his book The empire of Manuel Komnenos by placing it in the context of the Komnenian restoration of the Byzantine empire as a whole; he points out that while John's father Alexios had fortified places on the coast, John now expanded Byzantine control into the interior by fortifying places such as Lopadion, Achyraous and Laodicea, which guarded the approaches to the valleys and coastlands of Asia Minor. This restoration of order under John enabled agricultural prosperity to begin a recovery that would eventually restore these war torn regions to their former status as a productive and valuable part of the Byzantine empire.Magdalino, Paul, The empire of Manuel I Komnenos 1143‚Äì1180 Towards the end of his reign, John made a concerted effort to secure Antioch. On the way, he captured the southern coast of Asia Minor and Cilicia. He advanced into Syria at the head of his veteran army, which had been seasoned by a lifetime of campaigning. Although John fought hard for the Christian cause in the campaign in Syria, there was a famous incident where his allies, Prince Raymond of Antioch and Count Joscelin II of Edessa, sat around playing dice while John pressed the Siege of Shaizar. These Crusader Princes were suspicious of each other and of John, and neither wanted the other to gain from participating in the campaign, while Raymond also wanted to hold on to Antioch which he had agreed to hand over to John if the campaign was successful.Oldenbourg, Zoe, The Crusades Ultimately, Joscelin and Raymond conspired to keep John out of Antioch, and while he was preparing to lead a pilgrimage to Jerusalem and a further campaign, he accidentally grazed his hand on a poison arrow while out hunting. The poison set in and shortly afterwards he died. Historian J. Birkenmeier has recently argued that John's reign was the most successful of the Komnenian period. In \\"The development of the Komnenian army 1081‚Äì1180\\", he stresses the wisdom of John's approach to warfare, which focused on siege warfare rather than risky pitched battles. Birkenmeier argues that John's strategy of launching annual campaigns with limited, realistic objectives was a more sensible one than that followed by his son Manuel I. According to this view, John's campaigns benefited the Byzantine Empire because they protected the empire's heartland from attack while gradually extending its territory in Asia Minor. The Turks were forced onto the defensive, while John kept his diplomatic situation relatively simple by allying with the Western Emperor against the Normans of Sicily. Overall, John II Komnenos left the empire a great deal better off than he had found it. Substantial territories had been recovered, and his successes against the invading Petchenegs, Serbs and Seljuk Turks, along with his attempts to establish Byzantine suzerainty over the Crusader States in Antioch and Edessa, did much to restore the reputation of his empire. His careful, methodical approach to warfare had protected the empire from the risk of sudden defeats, while his determination and skill had allowed him to rack up a long list of successful sieges and assaults against enemy strongholds. By the time of his death, he had earned near universal respect, even from the Crusaders, for his courage, dedication and piety. His early death meant his work went unfinished; historian Zoe Oldenbourg speculates that his last campaign might well have resulted in real gains for Byzantium and the Christian cause. ==Manuel I Komnenos== Map of the Byzantine Empire under Manuel Komnenos, c. 1170. By this time, the empire was once again the most powerful state in the Mediterranean, with client states stretching from Hungary to the Kingdom of Jerusalem, and a network of allies and diplomatic contacts stretching from Aragon, France, Germany, Pisa, Genoa and Rome in the west, to Antioch, Jerusalem, Konya and Damascus in the east. John's chosen heir was his fourth son, Manuel I Komnenos. According to Niketas Choniates, a historian of Byzantium, Manuel was chosen over his elder surviving brother because of his ability to listen carefully to advice. Manuel was known for his lively and charismatic personality; he was known for his love for all things from Western Europe. Manuel arranged jousting matches, even participating in them, an unusual experience for the Byzantines. Manuel himself is generally considered the most brilliant of the four emperors of the Komnenos dynasty; unusual for a Byzantine ruler, his reputation was particularly good in the west and the Crusader states, especially after his death. The Latin historian William of Tyre described Manuel as \\"beloved of God... a great-souled man of incomparable energy\\", [whose] \\"memory will ever be held in benediction\\". Manuel was further extolled by Robert of Clari as a \\"generous and worthy man\\". Manuel dedicated himself to restore the glory of his empire and to regaining superpower status. His foreign policy was both ambitious and expansive, reaching out to all corners of the Mediterranean world. He made several alliances with the Pope and Western Christian kingdoms, and successfully handled the passage of the potentially dangerous Second Crusade through his empire, establishing a Byzantine protectorate over the Crusader kingdoms of Outremer. Manuel campaigned aggressively against his neighbours both in the west and in the east; facing Muslims in Palestine, he allied himself with the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem and sent a large fleet to participate in a combined invasion of Fatimid Egypt. In an effort to restore Byzantine control over the ports of southern Italy, he sent an expedition to invade Italy in 1155. Operating as part of a coalition of Byzantine, rebel, and Papal forces, Manuel's armies achieved initial success. However, disputes within the coalition led to the expedition's eventual failure. Despite this military setback Manuel was undeterred, and his armies successfully invaded the Kingdom of Hungary in 1167, defeating the Hungarians at the Battle of Sirmium. He was highly successful in the Balkans and Hungary; historian Paul Magdalino argues that no emperor had dominated the region so effectively since Late Antiquity. In the east, however, Manuel's achievements are more ambiguous. He suffered a major defeat at the Battle of Myriokephalon in 1176 against the Turks. Manuel was marching against Konya, the Turkish capital, when his forces were ambushed; the ensuing defeat has since entered the popular imagination as a legendary disaster. Exaggerated accounts of the battle often describe the destruction of the entire Byzantine army, and with it the end of Byzantine power and influence. However, the modern consensus among Byzantine historians is that, while the Battle of Myriokephalon was a serious humiliation for the emperor, it was certainly not a catastrophe. Nor was it in any way equivalent to the Battle of Manzikert over a century earlier. In fact, much of the emperor's army emerged from the battle without serious damage. Units involved in the battle are well documented as campaigning in Asia Minor the following year. The imperial frontier remained unmoved for the remainder of Manuel's reign, a clear indication that the Turks were unable to gain any advantage from their victory. In 1177, the Byzantines inflicted a major defeat on a large Turkish force at Hyelion and Leimocheir in the Meander valley. Settlements and regions affected during the first wave of Turkish invasions in Asia Minor (1050-1204). Manuel's programme of fortification in Byzantine Asia, for which he was praised by Byzantine historian Niketas Choniates, is largely regarded as an important success. Manuel demanded tribute from the Turkmen of the Anatolian interior for the winter pasture in Imperial territory; he also improved the defenses of many cities and towns, and established new garrisons and fortresses across the region. As a result of the cumulative efforts of all three Komnenian emperors, Manuel's domination of Asia Minor was more effective than that of any emperor since before Manzikert. As historian Paul Magdalino makes clear, \\"by the end of Manuel's reign, the Byzantines controlled all the rich agricultural lowlands of the peninsula, leaving only the less hospitable mountain and plateau areas to the Turks.\\" In the religious sphere, disputes between the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church occasionally harmed efforts at cooperation with the Latins; however, Manuel was almost certainly the Byzantine emperor who came closest to healing the breach between the two churches. Pope Innocent III clearly had a positive view of Manuel when he told Alexios III that he should imitate \\"your outstanding predecessor of famous memory the emperor Manuel... in devotion to the Apostolic See, both in words and in works\\". Manuel was very successful in expanding his influence, particularly over the Crusader states. As an example, he participated in the building and decorating of many of the basilicas and Greek monasteries in the Holy Land, including the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem where due to his efforts the Byzantine clergy were allowed to perform the Greek liturgy each day. All this reinforced his position as overlord of the Crusader states, with his hegemony over Antioch and Jerusalem secured by agreement with Raynald, Prince of Antioch, and Amalric, King of Jerusalem. This success in gaining influence and allies among the western states and the Pope is regarded one of the most impressive achievements of Manuel Komnenos's reign. ==Military reform== At the beginning of the Komnenian period in 1081, the Byzantine Empire had been reduced to the smallest territorial extent in its history. Surrounded by enemies, and financially ruined by a long period of civil war, the empire's prospects had looked grim. Yet, through a combination of determination, military reform, and years of campaigning, Alexios I Komnenos, John II Komnenos and Manuel I Komnenos managed to restore the power of the Byzantine Empire. An important factor in the success of the Komnenoi was their establishment of a reconstructed Byzantine army. The new military system which they created is known as the Komnenian army. From c. 1081 to c. 1180, the Komnenian army played an important role in providing the empire with a period of security that enabled Byzantine civilization to flourish. The new force was both professional and disciplined. It contained formidable guards units such as the Varangian Guard, the 'Immortals' (a unit of heavy cavalry) stationed in Constantinople and the Archontopouloi, recruited by Alexios from the sons of dead Byzantine officers, and also levies from the provinces. These levies included Kataphraktoi cavalry from Macedonia, Thessaly and Thrace, and various other provincial forces such as Trebizond Archers from the Black Sea coast of Asia Minor and the Vardariots, a cavalry unit recruited from Christianised Magyars from the Vardar valley. Alongside troops raised and paid for directly by the state, the Komnenian army included the armed followers of members of the wider imperial family and its extensive connections. In this can be seen the beginnings of the feudalisation of the Byzantine military. The granting of pronoia holdings, where land was held in return for military obligations, was beginning to become a notable element in the military infrastructure towards the end of the Komnenian period, though it became much more important subsequently. In 1097, the Byzantine Army numbered around 70,000 men altogether. By the closing years of the 1180-era, and the death of Manuel Komnenos, whose frequent campaigns had been on a grand scale the army was probably considerably larger. During the reign of Alexius I, the field army numbered around 20,000 men which was increased to about 30,000 men in John II's reign. By the end of Manuel I's reign the Byzantine field army had risen to 40,000 men. Under John II, a Macedonian division was maintained, and new native Byzantine troops were recruited from the provinces. As Byzantine Asia Minor began to prosper under John and Manuel, more soldiers were raised from the Asiatic provinces of Neokastra, Paphlagonia and even Seleucia (in the south east). Soldiers were also drawn from defeated peoples, such as the Pechenegs (cavalry archers), and the Serbs, who were used as settlers stationed at Nicomedia. Native troops were organised into regular units and stationed in both the Asian and European provinces. Komnenian armies were also often reinforced by allied contingents from Antioch, Serbia and Hungary, yet even so they generally consisted of about two-thirds Byzantine troops to one- third foreigners. Units of archers, infantry and cavalry were grouped together so as to provide combined arms support to each other. The emperor Manuel I was heavily influenced by Westerners (both of his queens were 'Franks') and at the beginning of his reign he re-equipped and retrained his native Byzantine heavy cavalry along Western lines. It is inferred that Manuel introduced the couched lance technique, the close order charge and increased the use of heavier armour. Manuel personally took part in 'knightly' tournaments in the Western fashion, where his considerable prowess impressed Western observers. Permanent military camps were established in the Balkans and in Anatolia, these are first described during the reign of John II. The main Anatolian camp was near Lopadion on the Rhyndakos River near the Sea of Marmora, the European equivalent was at Kypsella in Thrace, others were at Sofia (Serdica) and at Pelagonia, west of Thessalonica. These great military camps seem to have been an innovation of the Komnenian emperors and may have played an important part in the improvement in the effectiveness of the Byzantine forces seen in the period. The camps were used as transit stations for the movement of troops, as concentration points for field armies, for the training of troops and for the preparation of armies for the rigours of campaign. ==Twelfth century 'Renaissance'== church of Saint Panteleimon in Nerezi near Skopje, in North Macedonia. It is considered a superb example of 12th century Komnenian art. It has recently been argued that a '12th century renaissance' occurred in Byzantium. Although the term does not enjoy widespread usage, it is beyond doubt that 12th century Byzantium witnessed major cultural developments, which were largely underpinned by rapid economic expansion. The 12th century was a time of significant growth in the Byzantine economy, with rising population levels and extensive tracts of new agricultural land being brought into production. Archaeological evidence from both Europe and Asia Minor shows a considerable increase in the size of urban settlements, together with a ‚Äònotable upsurge‚Äô in new towns.Harvey, Alan, Economic expansion in the Byzantine empire 900‚Äì1200 In Athens the medieval town experienced a period of rapid and sustained growth, starting in the eleventh century and continuing until the end of the twelfth century. Thessaloniki, the second city of the Empire, hosted a famous summer fair which attracted traders from across the Balkans and even further afield to its bustling market stalls. In Corinth, silk production fuelled a thriving economy. In Asia Minor, some areas had become depopulated due to Turkish raiding in the late eleventh century. Yet as the Komnenian emperors built up extensive fortifications in rural areas during the twelfth century, repopulation of the countryside took place. Overall, given that both population and prosperity increased substantially in this period, economic recovery in Byzantium appears to have been strengthening the economic basis of the state. This helps to explain how the Komnenian emperors, Manuel Komnenos in particular, were able to project their power and influence so widely at this time. The new wealth being generated during this period had a positive impact on Byzantine cultural life. In artistic terms, the twelfth century was a very productive period in Byzantine history. There was a revival in the mosaic art, and regional schools of Architecture began producing many distinctive styles that drew on a range of cultural influences.Diehl, Charles, Byzantine Art According to N. H. Baynes in Byzantium, An Introduction to East Roman Civilization,Baynes, N. H., Economic expansion in the Byzantine empire 900‚Äì1200 ==Andronikos I Komnenos and the fall of the Komnenoi== Manuel's death on 24 September 1180, marked a turning point in the fortunes of the Byzantine Empire. When Manuel died, he was succeeded by his young son Alexios II Komnenos, who was under the guardianship of the empress Maria. Her conduct excited popular indignation, and the consequent disorders, amounting almost to civil war, gave an opportunity to the ambition of Manuel's estranged cousin, Andronikos I Komnenos (r. 1183‚Äì1185), son of Isaac Komnenos. Andronikos left his retirement in 1182, and marched on Constantinople with an army that (according to non-Byzantine sources) included Muslim contingents.Ibn Jubayr p. 355 Broadhurst (Turks and Arabs); William of Tyre, Historia Transmarina 22.11 (innumeras Barbararum nationum secum trahens copias); Walter Map, De Nugis Curialium 2.18 (Turks). His arrival was soon followed by a massacre of the Latin inhabitants, which was focused on the Venetian merchants who were settled in some numbers in Constantinople. He was believed to have arranged the poisoning of Alexios II's elder sister Maria the Porphyrogenita and her husband Renier of Montferrat, although Maria herself had encouraged him to intervene. The poisoner was said to be the eunuch Pterygeonites. Soon afterwards he had the empress Maria imprisoned and then killed, by Pterygeonites and the hetaireiarches Constantine Tripsychos. Alexios II was compelled to acknowledge Andronikos as colleague in the empire, but was then put to death; the killing was carried out by Tripsychos, Theodore Dadibrenos and Stephen Hagiochristophorites.Niketas Choniates, Histories pp. 260‚Äì274 van Dieten. Andronikos, by 1183 sole emperor, married Agnes of France, a child twelve years of age who had been formerly betrothed to Alexios II. Agnes was a daughter of King Louis VII of France and his third wife Ad√®le of Champagne. By November 1183, Andronikos associated his younger legitimate son John Komnenos on the throne. Andronikos Komnenos was a man of astounding contrasts.G. Ostrogorsky, History of the Byzantine State, 396 Handsome and eloquent, the new emperor was at the same time known for his licentious exploits.J.Harris, Byzantium and the Crusades, 117 Energetic, able and determined, Andronikos was a true Komnenos.J.J. Norwich, A short history of Byzantium, 291 However, he was also capable of terrifying brutality, violence and cruelty. Andronikos began his reign well; in particular, the measures he took to reform the government of the empire have been praised by historians. In the provinces, Andronikos' reforms produced a speedy and marked improvement.G. Ostrogorsky, History of the Byzantine State Andronikos's fierce determination to root out corruption and many other abuses was admirable; under Andronikos, the sale of offices ceased; selection was based on merit, rather than favouritism; officials were paid an adequate salary so as to reduce the temptation of bribery. Every form of corruption was eliminated with ferocious zeal. A medieval depiction of the death of Andronikos. Original in the Biblioth√®que Nationale, France. The people, who felt the severity of his laws, at the same time acknowledged their justice, and found themselves protected from the rapacity of their superiors.G. Ostrogorsky, History of the Byzantine State, 397 Andronikos's energetic efforts to rein in the oppressive tax collectors and officials of the empire did much to alleviate the lot of the peasantry. However, his efforts to check the power of the nobility were considerably more problematic. The aristocrats were infuriated with him, and to make matters worse, Andronikos seems to have become increasingly deranged; executions and violence became increasingly common, and his reign turned into a reign of terror.J.Harris, Byzantium and the Crusades, 118 Andronikos seemed almost to seek the extermination of the aristocracy as a whole. The struggle against the aristocracy turned into wholesale slaughter, as the emperor resorted to ever more ruthless measures to shore up his regime. There were several revolts, leading to an invasion by King William II of Sicily. On September 11, 1185, during his absence from the capital, Stephen Hagiochristophorites moved to arrest Isaac Angelos, whose loyalty was suspect. Isaac killed Hagiochristophorites and took refuge in the church of Hagia Sophia. He appealed to the populace, and a tumult arose which spread rapidly over the whole city.J.Harris, Byzantium and the Crusades, 124 When Andronikos arrived, he found that his authority was overthrown: Isaac had been proclaimed emperor. The deposed Emperor attempted to escape in a boat with his wife Agnes and his mistress, but was captured. Isaac handed him over to the city mob and for three days he was exposed to their fury and resentment. His right hand was cut off, his teeth and hair were pulled out, one of his eyes was gouged out, and, among many other sufferings, boiling water was thrown in his face.J.J Norwich, A short history of Byzantium, 294 At last, led to the Hippodrome of Constantinople, he was hung up by the feet between two pillars, and two Latin soldiers competed as to whose sword would penetrate his body more deeply. He died on September 12, 1185. At the news of the emperor's death, his son and co-emperor, John, was murdered by his own troops in Thrace. Andronikos I was the last of the Komnenoi to rule Constantinople, although his grandsons Alexios and David founded the Empire of Trebizond in 1204. Nevertheless, Andronikos's role in the collapse of the empire is controversial; historians disagree over the extent to which his brief reign influenced events after his death. Andonikos's coup, together with his violent death, had weakened the dynastic continuity and solidarity on which the strength of the Byzantine state had come to rely.P. Magdalino, The Medieval Empire, 194 Furthermore, his so-called 'anti-Latin' policy has been criticised by some historians as a failure, in view of the increasing hostility it caused towards Byzantium in the west.G. Ostrogorsky, History of the Byzantine State, 398 In particular, Andonikos's failure to prevent the massacre of Latins in Constantinople in 1182 has been seen as especially significant, since henceforth Byzantine foreign policy was invariably perceived as sinister and anti-Latin in the west.J. Harris, Byzantium and the Crusades, 112 It has even been argued that Andronikos's attempts to crush the aristocracy were damaging to the empire's military power, since the aristocracy had become indispensable to the defences of the state. On the other hand, his reforms in the provinces were both wise and beneficial to the internal health and prosperity of the empire.Angold, p. 298 The Komnenian period was followed by the dynasty of the Angeloi, who oversaw perhaps the most crucial period in the Decline of the Byzantine Empire. The next quarter of a century would see Constantinople fall to an invading force for the first time in its history, and the final loss of the empire's 'great power' status. However, with the death of Andronikos, the Komnenian dynasty, having lasted 104 years, had finally come to an end. ==See also== * Komnenos dynasty and related family tree * Family trees of the Byzantine imperial dynasties * Byzantium under the Justinian Dynasty * Byzantium under the Heraclian * Byzantium under the Isaurians * Byzantium under the Macedonians * Byzantium under the Doukids * Byzantium under the Angeloi * Byzantine Empire under the Palaiologos dynasty ==Bibliography== *Michael Angold, The Byzantine Empire 1025‚Äì1204, Longman, Harlow Essex (1984). *J.

Burgruine Ortenburg In 1072, one Adalbert of Ortenburg, probably a younger son of Count Hartwig II of Gr√∂gling- Hirschberg (d. 1068/69), served as a Vogt stattholder in the Carinthian possessions of the Bishops of Freising. His castle Hortenburc was first mentioned in a 1091 deed, and was situated south of the Drava river within the Archdiocese of Aquileia ‚Äî across from Hohenburg Castle held by the rivaling Counts of Lurn, liensmen of the Salzburg archbishops. When the Lurn dynasty became extinct in 1135, the Counts of Ortenburg received large estates stretching from M√∂llbr√ºcke down the Drava Valley to Rennstein near Villach. They also held possessions in the Gegend Valley around Afritz. In 1191 they founded a hospital (Spittl) at the bridge across the Lieser river‚Äîsite of the later town of Spittal an der Drau. In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, Herman and Ulrich of Ortenburg served as Bishops of Gurk. Count Otto II joined the Crusade of 1197 of Emperor Henry VI. About 1330, Count Meinhard of Ortenburg acquired the estates of the extinct Counts of Sternberg between Lake Ossiach and W√∂rthersee. In the fourteenth century, the dynasty also owned the lands of Gottschee in Lower Carniola, where they founded the town of Gottschee (Koƒçevje) with German colonists from their Upper Carinthian lands. Ruins of Ortenburg Castle overlooking the Lurnfeld Valley of the Drava Struggling for autonomy against the Carinthian dukes from the House of Sponheim and their Meinhardiner successors, the Ortenburgs avoided open conflict. In 1306, when the Meinhardiner duke Henry of Carinthia reached for the Bohemian crown, the Ortenburgs supported his rival Rudolf I of Habsburg. Soon after, their immediate rights were acknowledged by the Habsburg king Albert I of Germany, and later confirmed by Emperor Sigismund in a 1420 deed. Two years before however, the last Count Frederick III of Ortenburg had died without heirs and his estates were inherited by Count Hermann II of Celje (Cilli). When the Counts of Celje themselves became extinct with the killing of Hermann's grandson Ulrich II in 1456, the Counts of Ortenburg-Neuortenburg claimed their ostensible rights, but failed to prove their kinship to the Carinthian Ortenburgs. Their attempts to gain the Ortenburg estates lasted until the 18th century, but were all rejected. Instead, the Habsburg emperor Frederick III took possession of the Ortenburg estates, which his great-grandson Archduke Ferdinand I of Austria granted to his treasurer Gabriel von Salamanca in 1524. Today, the ruins of the Ortenburg Castle can still be seen on Goldeck mountain above the village of Baldramsdorf, west of Spittal an der Drau in Carinthia, Austria. ==Genealogy== *Adalbert I (10381096), married Bertha of Die√üen- Andechs **Otto I (10881157), married Agnes of Auersperg ***Henry I (11381192) ***Otto II (11401197), married Brigida of Haimburg (Heunburg) ****Ulrich (11881253), Bishop of Gurk 12211253 ****Herman I (11961256), married Elizabeth of Heunburg, secondly Euphemia of Plain-Hardegg *****Frederick I (12471304), regent of Carniola under King Rudolph I of Germany, married Adelheid, daughter of Count Meinhard I of Gorizia-Tyrol ******Euphemia (12781316), married Count Hugo II of Werdenberg ******Catharine (b. 1279), married Rizzardo IV da Camino ******Meinhard I (12801332), regent of Carniola, founder of Gottschee County, married Elizabeth of Sternberg-Peggau *******Meinhard II (d. 1337), married Belingeria della Torre *******Herman II (d. 1338), married Adelheid of Hohenlohe *******Elizabeth, married Stephen II, Ban of Bosnia ******Otto III (12821343), married Sophia of Hardegg, daughter of Burgrave Berthold of Magdeburg ******Adelheid (12841304), Count Ulrich IV of Berg-Schelklingen ******Albert I (12861335) *******Rudolph, married Margaret, daughter Count Albert II of Gorizia (G√∂rz) *******Adelheid (d. 1391), married Count Ulrich I of Celje (Cilli) *******Frederick II (d. 1355), married Margaret of Pfannberg *******Albert (d. 1390), Prince-Bishop of Trent 13631390 *******Otto IV (d. 1374/76), regent of Carniola, married Anna of Baboniƒá-Krupp ********Frederick III (d. 1418), regent of Carniola, married Margaret of Teck *****Euphemia (12561292), married Count Albert I of Gorizia ***Hermann (11471200), Bishop of Gurk 11791180 ***Agnes (11491207), married Berthold I, Count of Tyrol == References  External links == *Genealogie *Gottschee *Jahrhundertbuch E.

He obtained a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from the Chicago Technical College and held various executive positions at Cargill International and John Deere & Co. After working with those companies on developing their markets in Central Europe, he became involved in a number of his own business ventures in Poland after the end of the Communist rule in 1989. He was a co-founder of Bakoma S.A., the largest yogurt company in Poland, which was eventually acquired by Dannon Company. In 2003, Mazur was listed as one of the 25 richest Poles, with his family's permanent residence in Glenview, IL. == Investigation and Dropped Charges == He was accused by Poland's prosecutors of contracting, in 1998, the murder of Polish National Police chief, General Marek Papa≈Ça. In August 2014, the Polish prosecution dropped their case against Mazur. After a lengthy prosecution, they cited a lack of evidence against him to conclude that he committed the crime. Mazur was arrested in the U.S. in 2006 on a Polish extradition request. While that request dated back to 2005, the U.S. Justice Department had not taken any action on it until Poland's Minister of Justice Zbigniew Ziobro personally intervened with Attorney General Alberto Gonzales. The Polish government alleged that Mazur had paid Polish organized crime figures $40,000 to murder General Papa≈Ça. On 20 July 2007, after Mazur spent nine months in federal detention, Poland's request was rejected by Federal Magistrate Arlander Keys (Northern Illinois District Court) for lack of probable cause, mainly because the principal witness, Artur Zirajewski, lacked credibility in the court's view. Judge Keys harshly criticized the extradition request calling the government's reliance on Zirajewski's identification as \\"shocking and offensive\\" and stated that in his 12 years on the bench he hadn't even been close to rejecting an extradition.U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division. In the matter of Extradition of Edward Mazur Magistrate Judge Arlander Keys, July 20, 2007 Mazur's lawyer argued that his case exposed weaknesses in the U.S. extradition law dealing with the countries \\"lacking many of the legal safeguards of the United States\\". He accused Polish authorities of framing his client out of vindictiveness and a desire to smear the leftist opposition, to which Mazur has close ties, and the U.S. government of pursuing this \\"paper-thin\\" case out of political expedience to placate an allied government.

Following the occupation of Seville, C√°diz became the Spanish seat of power,. and was targeted by 70,000 French troops under the command of the Marshals Claude Victor and Nicolas Jean-de-Dieu Soult for one of the most important sieges of the war.Fremont-Barnes 2002, p. 26. Defending the city were 2,000 Spanish troops who, as the siege progressed, received aid from 10,000 Spanish reinforcements as well as British and Portuguese troops. During the siege, which lasted two and a half years, the Cortes of C√°dizwhich served as a parliamentary Regency after Ferdinand VII was deposeddrew up a new constitution to reduce the strength of the monarchy, which was eventually revoked by Fernando VII when he returned.Noble 2007, p. 30. In October 1810 a mixed Anglo-Spanish relief force embarked on a disastrous landing at Fuengirola. A second relief attempt was made at Tarifa in 1811. However, despite defeating a detached French force of 15,000‚Äì20,000 under Marshal Victor at the Battle of Barrosa, the siege was not lifted. In 1812 the Battle of Salamanca eventually forced the French troops to retreat from Andalusia, for fear of being cut off by the Coalition armies.Napoleonic Guide Cadiz 5 February, 1810 ‚Äì 24 August, 1812 retrieved 21 July 2007. The French defeat contributed decisively to the liberation of Spain from French occupation, due to the survival of the Spanish government and the use of C√°diz as a jump-off point for the Coalition forces.Rasor 2004, p. 148. == Prelude == In the early 19th century, war was brewing between French emperor Napoleon and the Russian Tsar Alexander I, and Napoleon saw the shared interests of Britain and Russia in defeating him as a threat. Napoleon's advisor, the Duke of Cadore, recommended that the ports of Europe be closed to the British, stating that \\"Once in Cadiz, Sire, you will be in a position either to break or strengthen the bonds with Russia\\".Napoleonic Guides Franco-Russian Diplomacy, 1810‚Äì1812 retrieved 21 July 2007. Soult and his French army invaded Portugal in 1809 but were beaten by Wellesley at Oporto on 12 May. The British and Spanish armies advanced into mainland Spain, however the difficulties that the Spanish army bore forced Arthur Wellesley to retreat into Portugal after Spanish defeats in the battles of Oca√±a and Alba de Tormes. By 1810 the war had reached a stalemate. Wellesley strengthened Portuguese and Spanish positions with the construction of the Lines of Torres Vedras, and the remainder of the Spanish forces fell back to defend the Spanish government at C√°diz against Soult's Army of Andalusia. == Siege == Nicolas Soult, Duke of Dalmatia Portrait of General Manuel la Pe√±a, commander of the Coalition forces that attempted to relieve the siege The port of C√°diz was surrounded on land by the armies of Soult and Victor, in three entrenched positions at Chiclana, Puerto Real and Santa Maria, positioned in a semicircle around the city. In the case of the former position, only an area of marshland separated the forces.Napier 1840, p. 169. The French initially sent an envoy with a demand for surrender, which was refused. The fortress of Matagorda, north of C√°diz, was bombarded by the French. When the fort became untenable, it was evacuated by the defending 94th Regiment of Foot. The last person to leave was to be Maj Lefebure of the Royal Engineers, whose job was to fire a mine to destroy the fort, but he was killed by a cannon shot. The French forces now had access to the coast close to C√°diz. The ensuing bombardment of the Spanish coastal city involved some of the largest artillery pieces in existence at the time, including Grand Mortars, which were so large they had to be abandoned when the French eventually retreated, and fired projectiles to distances previously thought impossible, some up to in range. (The Grand Mortar was placed in St. James's Park in London as a gift to the British in honour of the Duke of Wellington.St. James's Park, London Ancestor, retrieved July 21, 2007.) The French continued to bombard C√°diz until the end of 1810, but the extreme distance lessened their effect. Thomas Graham. The terrain surrounding the strong fortifications of C√°diz proved difficult for the French to attack, and the French also suffered from a lack of supplies, particularly ammunition, and from continuous guerrilla raiding parties attacking the rear of their siege lines and their internal communications with Andalusia. On many occasions, the French were forced to send escorts of 150‚Äì200 men to guard couriers and supply convoys in the hinterland. So great were the difficulties that one historian judges that: French reinforcements continued to arrive through to 20 April, and the capture of an outer Spanish fort guarding the road through to the Puerto Real helped to facilitate the arrival of these forces. This captured fort also provided the French with a vantage point from which to shell ships coming in and out of the besieged Spanish port. During 1811 Victor's force was continually diminished by requests for reinforcement from Soult to aid his siege of Badajoz. This reduction in men, which brought the French numbers down to between 20,000‚Äì15,000, encouraged the defenders of C√°diz to attempt a breakout. A sortie of 4,000 Spanish troops, under the command of General Jos√© de Zayas, was arranged in conjunction with the arrival of an Anglo-Spanish relief army of around 16,000 troops that landed south in Tarifa. This Anglo- Spanish force was under the overall command of Spanish General Manuel la Pe√±a, with the British contingent being led by Lieutenant-General Sir Thomas Graham. On 21 February 1811 the force set sail for Tarifa, and eventually landed at Algeciras on 23 February. Eventually marching towards C√°diz on 28 February, the force met a detachment of two French divisions under Victor at Barrosa. The battle was a tactical victory for the Coalition force, with a French regimental eagle captured,History of the Corps of Royal Engineers Volume I by Maj Gen Porter page=272 but it was strategically indecisive. Smaller sorties of 2,000‚Äì3,000 men continued to operate out of C√°diz from April to August 1811. On 26 October British naval gunboats from Gibraltar destroyed French positions at St. Mary's, killing French artillery commander Alexandre-Antoine Hureau de S√©narmont. An attempt by Victor to crush the small Anglo-Spanish garrison at Tarifa over the winter of 1811‚Äì1812 was frustrated by torrential rains and an obstinate defence, marking an end to French operations against the city's outer works. On 22 July 1812, Wellesley won a tactical victory over Auguste Marmont at Salamanca. The Spanish, British and Portuguese then entered Madrid on 6 August and advanced towards Burgos. Realising that his army was in danger of being cut off, Soult ordered a retreat from C√°diz set for 24 August. After an overnight artillery barrage, the French intentionally burst most of their 600 guns by overcharging and detonating them. The Coalition forces captured many guns, 30 gunboats and a large quantity of stores. == In literature == * The siege of C√°diz features prominently in Bernard Cornwell's Sharpe's Fury, in which Richard Sharpe is forced to help defend the city from the French before going on to take part in the Battle of Barrosa.Sharpe's Fury summary for the British Council.

A seventh first-class match with Worcestershire was abandoned without a ball being bowled. This tour was the only occasion on which the South Americans played first-class cricket as a team representing the whole continent, though individual members of the side played for their countries in matches against touring teams from England that were designated as first-class. ==The Touring Team== The team was captained by Clement Gibson, who had played first-class cricket in England for Cambridge University, MCC and Sussex. The full team was: * Clement Gibson (c) * Cyril Ayling * Dennet Ayling * George Ferguson * Arthur Grass * Alfred Jackson * Arnold Jacobs * Frederick Keen * John Knox * Richard Latham * Henry Marshal * James Paul * Ronald Pryor * Robert Stuart * Charles Sutton ==First-Class Matches== The team played six first-class matches, and a seventh against Worcestershire was abandoned without any play. They beat an under-strength Oxford University by 10 wickets after Marshal scored 153 and Ferguson 85, and Dennet Ayling took 10 wickets in the match for 87 runs. Leicestershire then won the second first-class game rather easily by an innings and 33 runs, with the South American batting unreliable in both innings in a match affected by heavy showers. The Army also beat the touring side after a South American first innings of 303 in which Stuart scored 133 was followed by a second innings batting collapse. The match against Sir Julien Cahn's XI produced a remarkable victory for the South Americans. Cahn's XI made 413 in the first innings, largely due to 251 for Denys Morkel, the South African Test player, made in four hours. The South Americans responded with a century opening stand between Jackson and Dennet Ayling and totalled 338. The Ayling brothers then each took five wickets as Cahn's XI were all out for 150 and Dennet Ayling, with an unbeaten 86, took the touring side to victory by five wickets, sharing another century opening stand with Jackson. The match with Sussex was affected by rain and left drawn. Knox made an unbeaten 110, batting at No 9 in the South American innings. The final match of the tour was a heavy defeat to Scotland by eight wickets. ==Other Matches== The South Americans played 12 other matches, all of them one- and two-day games, and many of them affected by the weather in a wet summer. All the games were drawn, except the matches against Kent's Second Eleven and a team calling itself the Gentlemen of Somerset, both of which the touring team lost. The match against MCC at Lord's was a two-day game. MCC were captained by the 58-year-old Pelham Warner and included the South African Test player Herbie Taylor and England players J.W.Hearne and Eddie Dawson. The South Americans had slightly the worse of a high-scoring draw. ==References== * Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, 1933 edition, pp508-520. * CricketArchive.com Category:1932 in English cricket Category:English cricket seasons from 1919 to 1945 Category:International cricket competitions from 1918‚Äì19 to 1945 Category:Multi-national cricket tours of England Category:Cricket in South America ","title":"South American cricket team in England in 1932"},{"id":"12368687","text":"World University of Bangladesh () often abbreviated as (WUB) is a private university in Dhaka, Bangladesh.

Although it is classified as a defect, the criss-cross is more of a spatial anomaly than a functional one, and it is possible for the heart to have relatively normal functioning. The ventricles are rotated either clockwise or counterclockwise resulting in the twisting of their connection. The actual blood flow stream through the ventricles is not interrupted. == Symptoms == Crisscross heart is a very rare congenital heart defect, and results in many different symptoms, even though the heart still has the ability to perform its major function of pumping blood throughout the body. Individuals who have this disease will experience cyanosis which is a blue tint to the skin because of inadequate blood flow to the body, this symptom will be seen especially around the mouth. Other symptoms include pallor, extreme dyspnea, pulmonary valve stenosis, cardiac murmurs and a deviated ventricular septum. Pallor can be described as a pale color of the skin, and dyspnea is difficulty breathing. Pulmonary valve stenosis is the narrowing of the pulmonary valve which leads to decreased blood flow to the pulmonary artery. Cardiac murmurs are sounds that can be heard when using a stethoscope that make a swooshing noise rather than a normal ‚Äúlub-dup‚Äù. Lastly a deviated ventricular septum is when there is a hole between the ventricle walls resulting in blood between the ventricles flowing freely between each other. == Anatomy == In an anatomically correct heart the right atrium and right ventricle are working together to supply blood to the pulmonary artery, similarly to how the left atrium and the left ventricle work simultaneously to supply blood to the aorta. During the process of the heart contracting and releasing the right atrium and left atrium contract at the same time, while the left ventricle and right ventricle relax. In opposition, when the left atrium and right atrium are relaxed the left ventricle and right ventricle contract pushing blood to either the aorta or pulmonary artery. In an anatomically correct heart the atria are smaller than the ventricles. The ventricles include more muscle in order to push high quantities of blood throughout the body. Normal blood flow throughout the heart begins at the superior vena cava coming from the upper half of the body and the inferior vena cava coming from the lower half of the body. Next blood will be in the right atrium and will flow uninterrupted through the tricuspid valve through to the right ventricle. The blood from the right ventricle should go to the pulmonary artery via the pulmonary valve. The blood from the pulmonary vein enters the left atrium, then flows through the mitral valve to the left ventricle. After the left ventricle is filled with blood the aortic valve opens allowing blood to go through, which the blood then enters the aorta and goes to the rest of the body. == Diagnosis == Crisscross heart can be diagnosed by an echocardiogram, angiocardiogram, and a cardiac MRI. To diagnose crisscross heart during embryonic development a sonogram will be used, and it is very important identify the disease prenatally so the child can be treated immediately for better cardiac function in adulthood. ==Treatment== Without treatment crisscross heart can be fatal. The treatment is aimed to fix a deviated septum and pulmonary valve stenosis rather than the rotated heart itself. == Further reading == * == References  External links == Category:Congenital heart defects ","title":"Crisscross heart"},{"id":"12368724","text":"Alla mot en (\\"Everybody against one\\") was a Swedish game show that aired for two seasons on TV4, based on the Endemol format 1 vs. 100.

Like in other species of cetopsines, mature males have elongated distal filaments of the dorsal and pectoral fin rays and a convex (instead of straight) margin to the anal fin. The body is relatively elongate; anteriorly the body is not compressed much, but becomes progressively compressed posteriorly. The lateral line is complete and midlateral; though unbranched in P. bleekeri and P. esmeraldas, in P. atahualpa the lateral line has a few ventrally direct branches on the caudal peduncle. The dorsal profile is straight to slightly convex; the ventral profile is convex at the abdomen and straight posteriorly. The caudal peduncle depth is approximately equal to its length. The head in profile is acutely triangular overall with a bluntly rounded snout. The eyes are placed on the sides of the head and are visible from above, but not from below. The mouth is inferior and the width is about one-half the length of the head. They have three pairs of barbels, one pair of slender maxillary barbels and two pairs of mental barbels; all three pairs of barbels are approximately the same length. The caudal fin is moderately to deeply forked and symmetrical with the tips of the lobes slightly rounded. The base of the anal fin is comparatively long. The pelvic fins are also usually moderately long. P. atahualpa has shorter pelvic fins and is darker in colour than P. bleekeri. P. atahualpa has a maxillary barbel with a distinctly dark base instead of a pale base and a distinct notch behind the head that is not present in P. esmeraldas. Both P. atahualpa and P. esmeraldas have a distinct patch of pigment on the operculum not present in P. bleekeri. ==References== Category:Cetopsidae Category:Fish of South America Category:Fauna of Ecuador Category:Fauna of Peru Category:Catfish genera Category:Taxa named by Pieter Bleeker Category:Freshwater fish genera ","title":"Paracetopsis"},{"id":"12368774","text":"Nanosubmarines, or nanosubs, are synthetic microscopic devices that can navigate and perform specific tasks within the human body. Most of the self- propelled devices will be used to detect substances, decontaminate the environment, perform targeted drug delivery, conduct microsurgery and destroy malicious cells. Nanosubmarines use a variety of methods to navigate through the body; currently the preferred method uses the electrochemical properties of molecules. There have been multiple successful tests using this technology to heal mice with inflammatory bowel diseases. The general goal of nanosubmarines is to be able to produce a machine which can sense and respond autonomously, all while being fueled by its environment. == Uses == The main purpose of a nanosubmarine is to navigate the body and perform a specific task. The most speculated task is the treatment and diagnosis of diseases from within the body. This is supported by the task of detecting substances, as most diseases cause a specific type of protein or other molecule to be made in abundance within the bloodstream. Another speculated task is microsurgery. With this technology, doctors will be able to perform surgery on specific locations from within the body. One example of this could be a treatment for cancer. A nanosubmarine could be built to detect specific cancer cells within the body; after locating the cells, the nanosub would be able to kill only the mutated cells and ignore healthy cells. == Navigation == Navigation is one of the most difficult aspects to develop in nanosubmarines. The goal is to be able to travel throughout the bloodstream without getting stuck in even the smallest of capillaries. However, this is difficult because the smallest capillaries are 2 Œºm across (2.0 x 10‚àí6m); blood cells are about 7Œºm but they are easily pliable and can squeeze through the capillaries. Another challenge with navigation is the fact that physics restricts the amount of propulsion such a small device can output. The blood flow is simply too strong for any device even compete with the flow, therefore the nanosubmarine would have to be carried by the blood. One form of propulsion nanosubmarines could use is electrochemical. One example of a motor is a nanorod which is platinum on one side and gold on the other. When submerged in hydrogen peroxide the platinum oxidizes the H2O2 into 2H+ and O2. This process occurs because platinum takes two electrons from the molecule. On the other side of the rod, the gold reduces hydrogen peroxide into water, in doing so an electron is pulled from the gold. This causes a steady electron flow from the platinum side of the rod towards the gold side. Since the rod is so small, Newton's third law of physics applies. For any action there is a reaction, when the electrons are pulled across the surface of the rod, so too is the rod pulled in the opposite direction. == Scientific achievements == The first recorded success of a nanosubmarine was performed by a team of students led by Dan Peer from Tel Aviv University in Israel. This was a continuation to Peer's work at Harvard on nanosubmarines and targeted drug delivery. Tests have proven successful in delivering drugs to heal mice with ulcerative colitis. Tests will continue and the team plans to experiment on the human body soon. == See also == * Fantastic Voyage, novel and movie based on the nanosubmarine theme == References == Category:Nanotechnology ","title":"Nanosubmarine"},{"id":"12368780","text":"The culminating point in military strategy is the point at which a military force no longer is able to perform its operations.

It is located on Crowsnest Highway (British Columbia Highway 3), east of Grand Forks and southwest of Castlegar. ==History== Originally an important fishing ground to the Sinixt, Sanpoil, Okanagan and other tribes, pictographs can still be found around the north-east shore of Christina Lake. The village and the lake were named after Christina McDonald, daughter of fur-trader Angus McDonald, who ran the Hudson's Bay Company trading post at Fort Colville from 1852-1871. The arrival of the Canadian Pacific Railway in the late 1890s brought a number of townsites to the area around Christina Lake and it became a popular recreational area for visitors who came by rail from places like Grand Forks or Phoenix. In the early 1900s there were summer cottages, fishing and other activities. When the Cascade-Rossland Highway was completed in 1922, more tourists visited the region. During Prohibition in the United States, many American visitors from north-east Washington made the trip across the border to enjoy the local saloons and dance halls. During World War II, approximately 100 Japanese people were relocated in a summer resort hotel and its adjacent cabins, the Alpine Inn, on nearby English Point, where a school was established to teach Japanese and English., After the war and the restrictions were lifted, some of the families remained in the area. Alpine Inn in 1950 ==Present day== Since the years following World War II, Christina Lake has again become a recreation community. Christina Lake boasts the warmest water of any tree lined lake in Western Canada and is a summer time mecca for power boating and water sports. Opened in 1963 and expanded in 1986, the Christina Lake Golf Course was built at the location of the old ghost town of Cascade City. The course was designed by golf course architect Les Furber and it is the first course in Canada to offer the rare feature of black sand traps. The Trans Canada Trail and the historic Dewdney Trail and Kettle Valley Railroad Trail meet at Christina Lake, attracting hikers and tourists from around the world. The summer of 2011 saw the opening of the new Christina Living Arts Centre designed by Studio 9 Architecture + Planning which will act as the town's visitor's centre as well as an art gallery. The centre was built to LEED standards. Accompanying the Centre is the district's first Solar Aquatics water treatment facility. This is the second cold-climate Solar Aquatics built to date, completed two years after the first cold climate Solar Aquatics built in Cynthia, Alberta by the same company. Cristina Lake ==ClimateTexas Point Campground and other public access points== There are 4 main public access points at Christina Lake Texas Point is a campground in Christina Lake with a widely known and popular beach that includes cliffs that many residents and tourists scale and jump from. Christina Lake Provincial Park is the most used provincial park and is often busy, and has a big beach at the south end of the lake, as well as volleyball nets, and picnic tables. The community boat ramps are located at English Point near the marina and Texas Point near the provincial campground. Take the Texas Point exit north of the village. Another Access point is at the Community Park and at the Living Arts Centre. You can either get to the beach at the Living Arts Centre end which has a nice beach beside the outflow of the lake and amid cottonwoods, or at the north end of the park, where Sutherland Creek flows into the lake. There is a sandy beach there as a result of the sand bar. Kingsley Beach, is a public access point at LaValley Point, where many people who stay at the hotels along Kingsley road go to get to the beach. It is where the old Christina Lake Hotel and Dance Pavilion used to be. There are also the Provincial Park Campsites. There are many other public access points around the lake but not many people know about them or where they are. ==See also== * Christina Lake Provincial Park * ChristinaLake.com ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:Populated places in the Boundary Country Category:Unincorporated settlements in British Columbia Category:Designated places in British Columbia ","title":"Christina Lake, British Columbia"},{"id":"12368818","text":"Martin Czechowic (or Marcin Czechowic) (c.1532-1613) was a Polish Socinian (Unitarian) minister, Protestant reformer, theologian and writer.Lech Szczucki Marcin Czechowic, 1532-1613 Warsaw 1964 ==Life== Born in ZbƒÖszy≈Ñ on the German border,Grzegorz Marek Chromik Feudalni panowie Czechowic 1997 Czechowic received a humanistic education in Pozna≈Ñ and at the University of Leipzig (1554).The New Testament of Marcin Czechowic 1577 in University of California publications in modern philology p116 University of California, Berkeley - 1989 \\"We do not know where Czechowic began his education; he completed a year's study at the University of Leipzig in 1554\\" He lived at a time when religious unrest was prevalent in Poland. Numerous religious sects arose, varying from the old Catholicism and the new Reformation to sects which rejected the Trinity and denied the divinity of Jesus. The members of the sect which professed disbelief in the Trinity were called Unitarians, and the most radical among them were called by their opponents \\"Half Jews\\" or \\"semi- judaizers\\". The religious dissension and constant disputes which arose in consequence led to a number of Jews taking part in these disputations. Conversion to Calvinism Like many of his era, Martin Czechowic's religious life was marked by gradual rather than sudden changes in his religious views. He was originally a Roman Catholic priest in K√≥rnik until 1555, when he became a member of the Moravian Brethren in Vilna where he had gone to Lithuania to work for the Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç family. Miko≈Çaj \\"the Black\\" Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç sent him on a fruitless mission to Geneva to convert Calvin and the Reformers\\"Marcin Czechowic\\" from AntipasDarius Petk≈´nas, Holy Communion Rites in the Polish and Lithuanian Reformed Agendas of the 16th and Early 17th Centuries, University of Helsinki, 2004, p. 133 but it was Czechowic who adopted Lutheranism and eventually, Calvinism, himself. Later he would support anabaptist and unitarian views. Conversion to the Polish Brethren Twenty years later Czechowic had moved from the Calvinist Ecclesia Major to the Unitarian Ecclesia Minor, or Polish Brethren. In doing so he adopted what was later to be known as the \\"Socinian\\" position,Verein f√ºr Reformationsgeschichte, 1990 \\"advanced by Czechowic was that Christ was not merely a prophet or a wise rabbi but the son of God and the true messiah of ...

Czechowic believed that Jesus was human, but because he was born without sin, it was right to worship him. Czechowic was in his mid-forties, of the same generation as Fausto Sozzini, Georg Schomann, Gregory Pauli, Krzysztof Morsztyn Sr., Pierre Statorius. He has been described as the \\"Pope\\" of the Polish brethren, though this is something of an exaggeration - it is perhaps more that as a native Pole among so many German, Italian and French exiles he had more traction within the local brotherhood. He adopted unconditional pacifism and opposed infant baptism and, because of the political obligations, the amassing of private property. Czechowic, Martin (o Marcin) His attitude to Eve's sin was relatively progressive for the period.Maria Bogucka Women in early modern Polish society, against the European background 2004 p68 \\". theologian Marcin Czechowic said simply that 'Adam . . . broke God's interdictions because of his wife who led him astray, having herself been deceived by Satan', but he did not draw from this event any pejorative conclusions for ...\\" Czechowic, like most of the Polish Brethren, was not supportive of the personal idea of Fausto Sozzini that baptism is not necessary for individuals who believe and who have grown up in Christianity,\\"Kiesling, Johann Rudolf\\" in the Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia Online but Sozzini did not push his idea, and was generally accepted in the movement that later became known by his name. Polish Bible translation Prior to the 1565 break between the Calvinist and Radical Arian wings of the Reformed Church there had been cooperation on the six years 1557-1563 at the \\"Sarmatian Athens\\" at Pi≈Ñcz√≥w, to produce the Biblia Brzeska. However now the Polish Brethren felt that this Bible contained too many readings supportive of orthodox Calvinist teaching on infant baptism, heaven and hell, immortality of the soul and the doctrine of the Trinity. Czechowic was at first involved with Symon Budny in a Socinian translation of biblical scriptures, but later had to part waysSergiusz Michalski - 1993 with Budny over 2 issues: Budny's sceptical attitude to the Greek text as the basis of a translation - preferring Jewish and Hebrew readings, and Budny's support of Jacobus Palaeologus for the right of the Christian to use force, where Czechowic sided with the conscientious objection ideals of Gregory Pauli of BrzezinyPeter Brock Against the draft: essays on conscientious objection from the 2006 Page 35 - \\"Though quite as convinced as Paulus of the rightness of this viewpoint, Czechowic was less impetuous in imputing evil \\" and Fausto Sozzini. Budny produced his Polish versions 1572, 1574, 1589, Czechowic a Polish version 1577.The New Testament of Marcin Czechowic 1577 in University of California publications in modern philology p116 Czechowic got caught up in a controversy over scriptural translation and interpretation with his contemporary Jakub Wujek, a Jesuit and the translator of the first Catholic Polish version of the Bible. Wujek freely took from the Brzeska, Budny and Czechowic versions, providing notes of \\"teachings and warnings\\" where he considered them heretical. In reply Czechowic published Plaster for a publication of the New Testament by Father Jakub Wujek. Which took Wujek to task from the point of view of biblical scholarship, and then made a blow-by-blow analysis of the Jesuit's translation and his \\"teachings and warnings\\". Czechowic accused Wujek of uncredited plagiarism of whole sections. Wujek did not reply but the Jesuit ≈Åaszcz (Martinus Lascius 1551-) published Prescription for a Plaster of Czechowic under the pen name \\"Szczesny Zebrowski.\\" Piotr Wilczek, \\"Catholics and Heretics: Some Aspects of Religious Debates in the Old Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth\\"Marcin ≈Åaszcz \\"Recepta na Plastr Czechowica\\" ==Legacy== Czechowic died in poverty and obscurity in 1613. Unlike Sozzini, Crellius, Statorius and other exiles, he did not mark the next four generations at the Racovian Academy with his descendants. The fact that his major writings were in Polish, not Latin, left him a minor place in publications such as the Bibliotheca Fratrum Polonorum quos Unitarios vocant 1668, and Bibliotheca antitrinitariorum 1684 of Sozzini's grandson Andrzej Wiszowaty and Christopher Sandius, which influenced Newton and Voltaire. Stanis≈Çaw Kot contributed a biography of Czechowic to the Polski s≈Çownik biograficzny (Cracow, 1937, 1957), though till Lech Szczucki published his monograph Marcin Czechowic, 1532-1613 Warsaw 1964, Czechowic was all but forgotten, even in Poland. In the West his name was publicised a little in the works George Huntston Williams in The Radical Reformation 1962, and these sources were picked up by the geographer Alan Eyre who ran articles on Czechowicz in The Christadelphian magazine in the 1970s. His Rozmowy Chrystia≈Ñskie was reprinted by the Polish Academy of Sciences in 1979. ==Works== Sumariusz 1570 A Polish verse New Testament A denunciation of the baptism of infants entitled De paedobaptistarum errorum origine et de ea opinione, qua infantes baptizandos esse in prima nativitatis eorum exortu creditur (Lublin, 1575).

His dates of birth and death are unknown. Djimba Mikulinov was the Baksha of the Ike Burul aimak when he was chosen to succeed Arkad Chubanov as the Lama of the Don Kalmyks in 1894. He was known as the controversial lama who served for only two years. The controversy began two years after Djimba Mikulinov's appointment when he, his secretary and the ataman of the Ike Burul aimak were charged with forging the will of the late Lama Arkad Chubanov. According to local Don Cossack authorities, the provision in Arkad Chubanov's will nominating Djimba Mikulinov as his successor was forged. Therefore, Djimba Mikulinov's appointment was improper. The Russian court, however, ruled otherwise on all charges, freeing Djimba Mikulinov and his co-defendants, but his career as Lama of the Don Kalmyks was over. It is believed the Don Cossack authorities and Russian Orthodox missionaries instigated the controversy to eliminate the institution of the head lama of the Don Kalmyks. Since Arkad Chubanov's reign, both entities have attempted on numerous occasions to close Don Kalmyk khuruls. After his removal as the head lama, Djimba Mikulinov was not formally replaced until 1903, when Menko Bormanzhinov was elected to become the spiritual leader of the Don Kalmyks. During the intervening years, the Don Kalmyks were led by the Baksha of the Ike Burul aimak, Boka Kuliushov who acted as the deputy head lama. ==References== *Bormanshinov, Arash.

Six men, including the driver, were shot and killed. Among them was Frederick Wadsworth Loring,July 29, 1876 The Arizona Citizen, front page a young writer from Boston working as a correspondent for Appleton's Journal assigned to cover a cartographic expedition led by Lieutenant George Wheeler. One male passenger, William Kruger, and the only female passenger, Mollie Sheppard, managed to escape. According to Kruger, Sheppard eventually died of the wounds she received.\\"What Really Happened to Mollie Sheppard?\\"; by: Jan MacKell Collins For a time the identity of the attackers was disputed. Over the next two years, General George Crook conducted an investigation into the attack, and eventually identified all the perpetrators. After trying to arrest the ringleaders without success, Crook sent Captain J. W. Mason to Burro Creek, where he encountered those responsible for the massacre as well as innocent Yavapai natives in three rancherias. Many were killed in the battle that followed. Seven months prior to the Wickenburg incident, 144 Apaches were killed in the Camp Grant Massacre near Tucson, and Eastern sentiment was with the victims. However, Loring's death in Wickenburg turned public opinion against the Yavapai. In February 1875, though once promised reservation land near Prescott \\"forever and forever\\", the Yavapai tribe was uprooted and driven 180 miles south to the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation, where they were forced to live beside their enemies from centuries past, the Chiricahua Apaches. Memorial plaques have been installed near the site several times, including in 1937 by the Arizona Highway Department and in 1948 and 1988 by the Wickenburg Saddle Club. The Wickenburg Massacre was featured on a April 12, 1996, episode of Unsolved Mysteries. ==See also== *List of massacres in Arizona ==ReferencesFurther reading== * * Dan L.

In October 2006, he went on trial at Eredivisie side PSV Eindhoven and Ajax. After the trial, it was announced two months later that PSV Eindhoven signed Reis on a five‚Äìyear contract. However, the move will not take effect until July 2007, as he wasn't eighteen at the time of signing for the club. It was also revealed that the club did not pay the transfer fee to sign Reis. Ahead of the 2007‚Äì08 season, Reis was given a number nineteen shirt. He was mentioned by Manager Ronald Koeman about using him in the first team in the 2007‚Äì08 season before leaving in October 2007. Reis officially made his PSV Eindhoven debut in the Johan Cruyff Shield against Ajax on 11 August 2007, where he started the match before coming off in the 73rd minutes for G√©nero Zeefuik, in a 1‚Äì0 loss. Eight days later on 19 August 2007, Reis set up a goal for Ibrahim Afellay, in a 2‚Äì0 win over Heracles Almelo. He then made his UEFA Champions League debut on 12 December 2007, coming on as a late substitute, in a 1‚Äì0 loss against Inter Milan. However, he spent the rest of the sidelined, due to lack of first team opportunities. Ahead of the 2008‚Äì09 season, Reis suffered a foot injury, causing him to miss PSV Eindhoven's pre-season tour. However, PSV coach Huub Stevens, furious over this 'unprofessional attitude', relegated him to the reserve squad. Stevens was also dismayed by the bad influence of Reis' agent Vlado Lemiƒá.Stevens: \\"Reis heeft deur flink dichtgegooid\\" FCUpdate.nl 2008-08-13, retrieved on 2009-09-22. After receiving more disciplinary action for returning too late from a stay in Brazil where he attended his grandmother's funeral, his career at PSV looked over.PSV bestraft te laat teruggekeerde Reis opnieuw FCUpdate.nl 2008-12-18, retrieved on 2009-09-22. Fellow Dutch league teams Roda JC and FC Utrecht as well as Portuguese side Vit√≥ia Set√∫bal showed interest, but Reis stayed at PSV. However, in January 2009 Reis returned to Brazil by joining Tupi for the rest of the season. In the 2009‚Äì10 season, Reis was given a first team chance following a new management of trainer Fred Rutten after he made some impressive pre-season performance. Reis made his first appearance of the 2009‚Äì10 season came on 27 August 2009, where he came on as a late substitute, in a 1‚Äì0 win over Bnei Yehuda Tel Aviv; winning 2‚Äì0 on aggregate to send them through to the Group Stage. It wasn't until on 12 September 2009 when he made his first league appearance in over a year, coming on as a late substitute, in a 3‚Äì0 win over Roda JC. On 17 September 2009, in the Europa league group K match at Sparta Prague, Reis came on as substitute in the 64th minutes and scored twice, in a 2‚Äì1 win, salvaging a point and becoming an unlikely hero.Jonathan wins valuable point for PSV in Prague: 2‚Äì2 PSV.nl 2009-09-18, retrieved on 2009-09-22. Then on 23 September 2009, Reis plays his first full match for PSV in the 2‚Äì1 Dutch Cup win against first division side De Graafschap. He added three goals throughout October, scoring against Copenhagen, N.E.C. and Roda JC. He added three more goals between 27 November 2009 and 6 December 2009, scoring twice in the league and once in the UEFA Europa League. Since returning to the first team, Reis established himself in the starting eleven at the striker position. On 24 January 2010, however, his contract was terminated after he tested positive for a banned substance and subsequently refused the club's offer of help to treat drug addiction. It was reported that in the case of Reis signing for another club, PSV would file a lawsuit against the player to try to get back some of the money the club had invested in him. Up until his release, Reis made twenty appearances and scoring eight times in all competitions. Reis warming up for the side. Since his release by PSV Eindhoven, Reis spent time at rehab in Brazil for several months. Over the summer, the club were determined to re‚Äìsign him. Eventually, on 17 July 2010, Reis re‚Äìsigned for PSV Eindhoven for the second time, signing a one‚Äìyear contract, with an option of extending the contract into a three-year deal. In the 2010‚Äì11 season, Reis‚Äô first month return saw him out of the first team, as he was not selected in the starting eleven. Instead, he spent his first month return with the club's reserve. The following month, on 16 September 2010, Reis played his first match since re‚Äìjoining the club, in a UEFA Europa League match against Sampdoria, coming on as a late substitute, in a 1‚Äì1 draw. After losing his place over driving under the influence of alcohol, he returned to the first team on 3 October 2010 against VVV-Venlo, scoring twice, in a 3‚Äì0 win. This was followed up by scoring against Willem II, Debreceni (scoring once in two separate matches) and Vitesse. Reis also netted a hat-trick against Feyenoord (his first in his professional career) in a 10‚Äì0 victory on 24 October 2010. His goal scoring form led suggestion from Piet de Visser that he could earn a place for the FIFA World Cup in Brazil (Reis‚Äô nationality) if only he continues to be clean. Due to his goalscoring forms, many people in Eindhoven thought the natural heir to Rom√°rio and Ronaldo's momentous heritage had finally arrived. However, in a 2‚Äì1 win over FC Utrecht on 7 November 2010, Reis was sent‚Äìoff mid-way through the first half after elbowing Alje Schut. As a result, he served a two match suspension. Things got bad to worse for Reis when he suffered a serious knee injury during a 3‚Äì1 win over Roda JC on 19 December 2010. It was announced that Reis would be out for the rest of the season and never played again. In response to the news, Reis received about 1400 messages from PSV supporters for positive support. Up until his knee injury, he went on to make fifteen appearances and scoring ten times in all competitions. He spent the rest of the season, rehabilitating and having operation on his knee injury. Throughout the 2010‚Äì11 season, his contract with PSV ran out despite PSV planning to offer Reis a one-year extension to his expiring deal, but was plagued due to fitness problems, as well as, speculations on whether or not, the contract is being offered on the table yet. However, Reis did not want to settle for anything less than a long-term contract and therefore decided to leave. Following his release from PSV, manager Fred Rutten stated Reis was making good progress in his recovery from a serious knee injury and expected his return to PSV in October. Reis was quoted as being hopeful of returning to PSV Eindhoven on a new deal but the club were not convinced that Reis would fully recover from his knee injury, and opted against offering him a new deal when it was made clear that he wanted to move on. Reis later reflected about his time at PSV Eindhoven and said: \\"The lifestyle I had at PSV was due to immature behaviour. I was young, alone in the Netherlands and wasn't responsible at that time. I'm not trying to justify using alcohol at that age, but the chance for things to go awry was made possible by the circumstances.\\" Vitesse Vitesse before the match against Twente at the GelreDome stadium in 2012. On 4 December 2011, Reis signed a contract until the end of the 2011‚Äì12 season with Vitesse, including an option to extend to extend. His move came after the club had been in the market for attacking reinforcements with Wilfried Bony being away on international duty with C√¥te d'Ivoire during the Africa Cup of Nations. However, he spent the rest of December, continuously having surgery. Then, on 22 January 2012, Reis made his first start on his debut for Vitesse before being substituted in the 66th minute for Mart Lieder against N.E.C. in a 1‚Äì0 loss. Five days later, on 27 January 2012, Reis was on the bench until coming on for Marcus Pedersen in the 66th minute facing his former club PSV in a 3‚Äì1 loss. During the match, he was welcomed back in Eindhoven with bags of powdered sugar being thrown onto the pitch in reference to his struggle with cocaine during his years at PSV. He spent the rest of the season in and out of the first team, either on the sideline and on the substitute bench. By April, Reis began to receive a handful of first team football for the side, as he helped Vitesse secure a UEFA Europa League place next season. At the end of the 2011‚Äì12 season, he went on to make thirteen appearances for the side in all competitions. On 27 June 2012, Reis signed a new deal with Vitesse, keeping him until 2016. In the 2012‚Äì13 season, Reis started the season well when he scored the club's fourth goal of the game, in a 4‚Äì4 draw against Lokomotiv Plovdiv in the first leg of the UEFA Europa League Second Round. In the second leg, SBV Vitesse ultimately went through to the next round after beating them 3‚Äì1. He then scored three goals the following month, including a brace against Willem II. His goal from a free kick against ADO Den Haag earned him August's Goal of the Month by the club's supporters. As a result, he became a first team regular for the side. Reis scored three goals in two matches between 25 November 2012 and 2 December 2012, scoring against his former club, PSV Eindhoven, and a brace against Roda JC. Towards the end of the 2012‚Äì13 season, Reis soon suffered a goal drought, as well as, fighting for his first team place. During a 2‚Äì0 loss against Feyenoord on 21 April 2013, Reis was shown ignoring his teammate, Valeri Qazaishvili when he was substituted, and was criticised by Manager Rutten after the match. At the end of the 2012‚Äì13 season, Reis went on to make thirty‚Äìsix appearances and scoring ten times in all competitions. Ahead of the 2013‚Äì14 season, Reis was given a number 9 shirt following the departure of Bony, who departed to Premier League side Swansea City. He, again, started the 2013‚Äì14 season well when he scored his first goal of the season, in a 1‚Äì1 draw against Petrolul Ploie»ôti in the first leg of the UEFA Europa League Third Round. Then, on 1 September 2013, Reis scored his first league goal for the club, in a 1‚Äì1 draw against AZ Alkmaar. However, he was sent to the reserve side by Manager Peter Bosz and explained his actions, saying: \\"I felt that was necessary, and that has everything to do with the team: if a player places himself outside, I have to intervene, that's what I did, so that's why I temporarily put him back to the promises.\\" The decision also contributed the pair fallen out. Up until then, Reis made five appearances and scoring two times this season so far. After spending two months away from the first team, Vitesse dissolved his contract in November 2013 despite having three more years left to his contract. Another factor of his departure was over his family unable to adapt in the country. Career after Vitesse Reis returned to his home country Brazil and joined Esporte Clube Bahia, only to have his contract with the club terminated ten days later. He joined Tombense and then Castelo, both of them were short‚Äìlived. He briefly joined Mamor√© at the end of 2014. At the beginning of 2015, Reis went on trial with Kazakhstan Premier League side Irtysh Pavlodar and Tunisian Ligue Professionnelle 1 side Esp√©rance Sportive de Tunis, both of them were unsuccessful. Boluspor On 29 July 2015, it was announced that Reis joined TFF First League side Boluspor. However, he never made an appearance for the side, as his time at Boluspor was overshadowed with transfer problem and weight problem. On 31 December 2015, it was announced that Reis was released by the club, along with eight players. He revealed that the factor of his departure was the \\"low wages\\" and was angry with the club. Hokkaido Consadole Sapporo Shortly leaving Boluspor, Reis moved to Japan, where he joined J2 League side Hokkaido Consadole Sapporo. He later revealed that the club's director of football, Hirokatsu Mikami, convinced him to join the club. He also goes under the name for the club, \\"Heise\\", and was given a number eleven shirt. Reis made his Hokkaido Consadole Sapporo debut on 6 March 2016, where he came on as a substitute, in a 4‚Äì0 win over FC Gifu. Since joining the club, Reis struggled a goal drought at the start of his Hokkaido Consadole Sapporo's career. It wasn't until on 4 June 2016 when he scored his first goal for the club, having come on as a substitute in a 2‚Äì2 draw against JEF United Chiba. Between on 13 June 2016 and 3 July 2016, Reis scored three goals in the club's four victories matches. However, he suffered injuries on two occasions between July and August. Reis later scored two more goals before being sidelined once again. He made his return from injury on 12 November 2016, coming on as a substitute, in a 2‚Äì1 win over JEF United Chiba. At the end of the 2016 season, which saw the club get promoted to J.League 1, Reis went on to make twenty‚Äìfour appearances and scoring seven times in all competitions. At the end of the 2017 season, Reis described the promotion to J.League 1 as the \\"best moments of his career\\". In the 2017 season, however, Reis suffered a knee injury that saw him sidelined for two months. It wasn't until on 21 June 2017 when he made his first team return from injury against Iwaki in the second round of the Emperor Cup and scored twice, as Hokkaido Consadole Sapporo lost 5‚Äì2. This was followed up by scoring two goal against Kashiwa Reysol and Shimizu S-Pulse. Reis then scored four more goals, including playing a role in the club's two victories against Vegalta Sendai and J√∫bilo Iwata. However, he was sidelined for the rest of the season, due to injuries. At the end of the 2017 season, Reis went on to make fourteen appearances and scoring eight times in all competitions. On 5 December 2017, he signed a contract with the club. In the 2018 season, Reis found his first team opportunities limited, as he was featured on the substitute bench in the number of matches. He scored his first goal of the season, in a 2‚Äì1 loss against Shimizu S-Pulse in the J. League Cup Group Stage on 4 April 2018. Having made ten appearances and scoring once for the club this season, it was announced on 30 August 2018 that Reis was released by the club after spending two years. Albirex Niigata Shortly after leaving Hokkaido Consadole Sapporo, Reis joined another J.League 1 side Albirex Niigata on 11 September 2018. However, he made no appearance for Albirex Niigata, due to suffering from heel injury. At the end of the 2018 season, Reis was released by the club. ==Club statistics== Updated to 23 February 2018.Nippon Sports Kikaku Publishing inc./Êó•Êú¨„Çπ„Éù„Éº„ÉÑ‰ºÅÁîªÂá∫ÁâàÁ§æ, \\"J1&J2;&J3;ÈÅ∏ÊâãÂêçÈëë„Éè„É≥„Éá„Ç£Áâà 2018 (NSK MOOK)\\", 7 February 2018, Japan, (p. 90 out of 289)Nippon Sports Kikaku Publishing inc./Êó•Êú¨„Çπ„Éù„Éº„ÉÑ‰ºÅÁîªÂá∫ÁâàÁ§æ, \\"2017 J1&J2;&J3;ÈÅ∏ÊâãÂêçÈëë (NSK MOOK)\\", 8 February 2017, Japan, (p. 130 out of 289) {  center;\\" - ! colspan=3  Club performance ! colspan=2  League ! colspan=2  Cup ! colspan=2  League Cup ! colspan=2  Total - !

Although the club denied reports that they would terminate his contract, he was instead fined and lost his place as a result. Following the incident, Reis expressed regret for his actions and vowed to repay the club. Two years later, he was summoned to court by the judge on 13 November 2012 to face charges. Ultimately, on his summoned to court, charges against him were dropped, at the request from his lawyer. Reis is married to his wife Thais and together, they have a son, Caique. He then became a father for a second when his son Ruka was born on 12 July 2018. In addition to speaking Portuguese, Reis is fluent in Dutch and currently taking Japanese lessons to speak the language. Following his Vitesse's career ended, Reis revealed that when he returned to Brazil, saying: \\" went back to Brazil, but my mentality was still very bad. I was not busy with my family or career as a professional footballer. I only thought about myself, about Jonah. I was selfish and went all out, into the nightlife of Belo Horizonte. My money went up so quickly. I did it all too easily and could no longer take good care of my family. Fortunately, my wife always kept talking to me to play football again at a professional club. On New Year's Eve of 2015, I decided to change course. I said to my wife, \\"I stop with alcohol and going out. I'm going to change my life. \\"She was happy with that, but of course she wanted to see it happen. After a year without disco life, I was a professional football player again.\\" ==ReferencesExternal links== * * * Profile at Hokkaido Consadole Sapporo Category:1989 births Category:Living people Category:Association football forwards Category:Brazilian footballers Category:Brazilian expatriate footballers Category:Clube Atl√©tico Mineiro players Category:PSV Eindhoven players Category:SBV Vitesse players Category:Esporte Clube Bahia players Category:J1 League players Category:J2 League players Category:Hokkaido Consadole Sapporo players Category:Eredivisie players Category:Expatriate footballers in the Netherlands Category:Expatriate footballers in Japan Category:People from Contagem ","title":"Jonathan Reis"},{"id":"12369053","text":"Koeleria glauca, commonly known as blue hair grass, is a grass species of the genus Koeleria.

She was a significant figure in the history of the British canal system. ==Biography== Ward was born on 4 April, 1884, the daughter of rope and twine manufacturer Thomas Amos and Sarah Ellen Hollowell. The family life centred on her birthplace of Stoke Bruerne, one of the major junctions of the English canals. She was never professionally qualified as a nurse, but she spent ten years travelling as what was then called a \\"nursing sister\\" in convents in Europe and the USA before returning home to nurse her sick father. This brought her into contact with the boat families again, many of whom she had known when she was growing up. \\"People think my boat people are dirty and crude and want to get rid of them, but they are wonderful, proud, wise people\\". She married Charlie Ward and, as her father's health declined, he took over the running of the family business. When this moved to a shed (formerly occupied by the stonemason) by the side of Lock 15, it became her surgery from where she administered medicine and care to the boat people. At first this was in an unofficial capacity and until the late 1930s she financed it from her own pocket. At this point the canal companies (precursors to British Waterways) began to recognise the importance of her work and she was appointed as a \\"consultant sister\\" to long-distance boatmen and families. Over several decades she acted as nurse, midwife, and even amanuensis to the mostly uneducated, illiterate boat people. ==Recognition== Ward was awarded the British Empire Medal in the 1951 New Year Honours. On 13 April 1959, she was the subject of the television programme This Is Your Life. Many of her friends from Stoke Bruerne attended the screening and a picture of this can still be seen hanging on the wall in the Boat Inn there. She retired in 1965. She was quoted as saying \\"You can't take me away from boat people. There isn't one of them wouldn't die for me, or one I wouldn't die for.\\"The Nursing Mirror, May 1947 She died seven years later in 1972 and was buried in the Baptist churchyard in Roade, England.

Her father, Chiao Jen-ho (), is a former secretary- general of the Straits Exchange Foundation. However, Chang has been quoted by the media as saying that she does not want to ride on the success of her father. Her stage name Deserts represents something \\"mysterious and suggests something hanging in limbo,\\" a representation of her personality. Chang started composing when she was 13 and began to perform on stage at 16. By the age of 19, Chang had written over 100 songs and got her first contract with Sony BMG., However, after recording, photo shooting and several campus performances, nothing happened. The young singer had waited for 5 years for the release of her debut album \\" My Life Will...‚Äù Though she released her first album in 2006, Chang was well known among live houses, pubs and the Internet before that. Her light and clear voice is heart-touching and inspiring, which attracts many college students and independent music lovers. Chang is also a guitar player, and writes most of her songs with acoustic guitar. Chang married her boyfriend Xu in August 2019 and gave birth to their first kid in September 2019. == Career == Chang dropped out of high school because she \\"couldn't stand the conservative restrictions.\\" She previously performed at pubs before entering the music recording industry. She was a member of the rock band Mango Runs, named most popular act and winner of the Indie Music Award at the 2003 Hohaiyan Rock Festival in Taipei County. Mango Runs was featured in the 2004 documentary Ocean Fever (Êµ∑Ê¥ãÁÜ±), which followed the stories of several acts at the Hohaiyan Rock Festival. Chang's debut album My Life Will... was released on 9 June 2006 under the record label Sony BMG. Although many of her fans objected to the recording deal, Chang promised that her style of music will not change. The album contains her music written between the ages of 13 and 19. Her presence in the alternative music scene was demonstrated in the 18th Golden Melody Awards, where she received four award nominations. Her debut album was nominated for Best Mandarin Album along with mainstream musicians such as Jolin Tsai. It was previously considered unthinkable for a high-profile Chinese language music awards show to nominate independent artists in its major categories. The singer has been enjoying growing popularity in Taiwan and Mainland China. At the 7th Chinese Music Media Awards in Hong Kong, Chang received the award for Best New Mandarin Artist. She released her second album Oh, dear. dear. I haven't. (Ë¶™ÊÑõÁöÑ...ÊàëÈÇÑ‰∏çÁü•ÈÅì) on 20 July 2007. For the song Áï¢Á´ü, she was nominated for Best Lyricist at the 19th Golden Melody Awards. Since then, she has been joined by three other musicians (Cent, Goodtone, and Sunho) to create a band called Algae. On 22 May 2009, her third album City (ÂüéÂ∏Ç) was released. Chang released her fourth album in August 2012. The album named Á•ûÁöÑÈÅäÊà≤ (Games We Play) was released under Sony music. The new album provides insights into Chang's life experiences over the past three years, in songs such as Â¶Ç‰Ωï; her constant advocacy for social issues, in song like Áé´Áë∞Ëâ≤ÁöÑ‰Ω† (Rose-colored), for she won her first Golden Melody Award for the song's lyrics. == Musical style == Using a guitar as her primary instrument. She is generally considered an indie artist despite having signed with recording giant Sony BMG. Chang's most downloaded song Baby (ÂØ∂Ë≤ù) was written after she turned 13 following a fight with her mother. However, the full song was not realized until later when she had learned how to play a musical instrument. ==Her Work== In her album named Games we Play, she published a song named Áé´Áë∞Ëâ≤ÁöÑ‰Ω† (meaning the rose-coloured you). The song is used to show her respect towards all fighters of freedom and democracy. ==Discography== Studio albums {  !align=\\"left\\"Year !align=\\"left\\"Album - !2005 width=500Maybe I Don't Care *31 March Indie Release *Live House Limited Edition - !2006 width=500My Life Will... *9 June Released by Sony BMG - !2007 width=500Dear...

The hot springs have been the site of various resorts since the 1860s. Since 1967, the hot springs have been the site of a Buddhist monastery which is opened to visitors during the summer months only. ==Etymology== Tasajera is a Spanish-American word derived from an indigenous Esselen language, which designates a \\"place where meat is hung to dry.\\" It has also been known as Tassajara Springs, Tesahara Springs and on mining claims as Agua Caliente. ==Location== The hot springs are located from Carmel Valley Road. The springs are currently privately owned by the San Francisco Zen Center which operates the Tassajara Zen Mountain Center on site. The last of the road into the springs is extremely narrow and steep, so much so that visitors are encouraged to use four-wheel drive vehicles or take a shuttle from Tassajara Hot Springs, California at Jamesburg, California, where the Zen Center maintains offices. Jamesburg is at the foot of Chews Ridge, from the hot springs. ==The springs== In 1918, the state mineralogist from the California State Mining Bureau produced a report detailing the large amount of hot water that issues at Tassajara Hot Springs through about seventeen thermal springs in the bed of the creek and along its southern bank. These range in temperature from about to and vary from mere seepages to flows of a minute. Thermal waters issue from a gneiss exposed along the creek for a distance of or more. Above and below this exposure the rock is granitic and in some places contains small garnets. The crystalline rocks are overlain by a series of shales, sandstones, and limestones, whose structure in the area north of Arroyo Seco is shown by the beds of massive buff-colored sandstone that dip northeastward at an angle of about 45¬∞. A western limb of this structure has not been recorded but may exist in the mountains further towards the coast. The observed dips at least suggest that Tassajara Hot Springs issue at a locality where Arroyo Seco crosses a zone of intense pressure in the underlying crystalline rocks. The springs have been known and used for many years and were visited early on by campers when the only access was by means of a difficult trail. In the early part of the 20th century, a well-graded wagon road was built southward from Jamesburg across the mountains and down into the canyon, and by 1918 the springs were easily reached by stagecoach. In 1904 a stone hotel was built, and other improvements added yearly so that by 1909 there was ample accommodation for 75 people, although a larger number were put up in tents. Water from two of the largest springs has been piped to tub and plunge baths, and a vapor bath constructed over the hottest spring, which issues from the creek bed. Analyses of two of the thermal waters showed them to be noticeably sulphuretted, and only moderately mineralized. The water of the arsenic spring has a distinctly yellow color, which in a few other springs has been ascribed to alkaline sulphides in solution. At the north edge of the creek, a few yards above the hot springs, there are two cool springs in which iron is deposited. An analysis of the easternmost of these springs was also made. The two hot springs apparently issue from the same general source and show only slight differences in composition. Primary salinity and primary alkalinity are the chief stable properties, but the waters are characterized by high subalkalinity, of which silica is the main component. The carbonate radicle reported is presumably calculated from the alkalinity determination and doubtless includes sulphides and possibly silicates. The apparent absence of arsenic in the so-called arsenic spring is noteworthy. Of markedly different character from the hot springs, the cool iron spring is less than half as concentrated and has secondary alkalinity as its dominant property. Subalkalinity is not reported, but is probably relatively low. The spring is probably of essentially surface origin, and not directly related to the thermal waters. Algous growths in the creek below the hot springs are recorded, as the growths are related to the sulphuretted character of the water. Although they are common to thermal sulphur springs, the relatively large volume of water in the creek at Tassajara Hot Springs, its comparatively slow cooling, and the presence of both swift currents and of quiet pools, affords an unusually good opportunity to observe growth variations. ==History== Esselen The springs were first used by native Esselen people who occupied the area for at least a thousand years before the Spanish colonial period. According to some historians and accounts, many of the local Native American people were subjugated by Spanish missionaries in the California Mission system under Father Jun√≠pero Serra. These claims are contested by the Diocese of Monterey. By the time of the American Civil War, the Europeans who came upon Tassajara found few traces of the Esselens' earlier presence. A few Esselen apparently continued to live in the region until at least the 1840s, escaping the harsh conditions of the mission and disease due to their remoteness. Europeans The springs were discovered by Europeans when a hunter found the springs in 1843. Frank Rust founded the public baths in 1868. In 1994, a skeleton was unearthed at Tassajara, and research suggested the individual had died about 150 years ago. In 1863, there was a brief \\"silver rush\\" in the Tassajara region. Eighteen mining claims were filed by 135 men (\\"supposed to contain gold and silver\\") in the \\"Agua Caliente Mining District.\\" The first mining claim for the area was recorded during the period of May 1‚Äì25, and it was named the \\"Vulcan Ledge\\", including \\"the stream of water called 'Agua Caliente'\\" (i. e., Tassajara Hot Springs). Visitors in the late 1800s traveled by stage over a rocky and steep road, and the last section was so steep that a long pine tree trunk was chained to the rear axles to slow the four horse stagecoach on the steep downgrade. During the early 1900s, a stagecoach ran twice weekly from Salinas to the springs, bringing visitors from all over the country to the springs. The road is steep and narrow, such that a modern four-wheel drive vehicle can take an hour to cover the rough, winding dirt-and-rock road leading from Jamesburg, California at over high Chews Ridge to the resort at . The Monterey County Board of Supervisors designated the trail to \\"Tesahara Springs\\" as a \\"public highway\\" in June, 1870, but work on a one-lane wagon road over Chews and Black Butte Ridges was not started until the spring of 1886.See also: Chews Ridge & Black Butte photographs, John Fedak, February 2006 The hot springs were completely surrounded by the Basin Complex fire in 2008. Five semi-trained staff members chose to remain behind, against the advice of professional fire-fighting personnel, and successfully defended the resort from the fire.  The Horse Pasture  A section of land near the springs was nicknamed The Horse Pasture because the flat meadow was once used by wranglers to pasture livestock when passengers used a stage coach to visit the springs. The land, an inholding within the borders of the Ventana Wilderness, was still owned by the Beck family in 2007. The land is a mixture of chamise-dominated chaparral, mixed oak, Coulter Pine forest, and meadow. The watershed offered obvious recreational opportunities and the potential for development as a wilderness retreat. The Wilderness Trust identified the parcel as a high priority for conservation and addition to the Ventana Wilderness. In partnership with the Big Sur Land Trust, they bought the land for $1.1 million. The Wilderness Trust later conveyed to the United States Forest Service for inclusion in the wilderness within the Santa Lucia Mountains in Monterey County, California. ==Zen Center== Menu board from the Tassajara kitchen. The springs and surrounding property are privately owned by the San Francisco Zen Center, which purchased the land from Robert and Anna Beck. The site, now formally known as Zenshinji (Zen Heart-Mind Temple) is used year-round as a training monastery by Zen Center. From Memorial Day to Labor Day each year, SFZC rents the simple monastic accommodations as well as allowing day visitors to use the hot springs. Otherwise, it is used exclusively by the monks for intensive practice following a traditional schedule established in Tang Dynasty China. ==NotesReferences== Category:Bodies of water of Monterey County, California Category:Hot springs of California Category:Monterey Ranger District, Los Padres National Forest ","title":"Tassajara Hot Springs"},{"id":"12369218","text":"Dame Yvonne Moores, DBE, FRSH, CIMgt (born 14 June 1941) is a retired British nurse.

The books are works of children's literature; eight of them are set in the fantasy world of the Dungeons and Dragons role-playing game, and two are set in TSR's science fiction world of Star Frontiers. Each book has about 80 pages. ==Books== 1\\\\. The Ring, the Sword, and the Unicorn Written by James M. Ward Illustrated by Mario Macari, Jr. Cover Art by Jeff Easley This book starts in a contemporary setting, and the only book in the series to do so. The main character, or You, tries to prove that there is a magical world in the forest behind your backyard. Gives added meaning to the cartoonish illustration on the back of the first six books, which pictures a child (presumably a boy) jubilantly stepping into a forest, his house in the background. 2\\\\. Ruins of Rangar Written by Michael Carr Illustrated by Michael Fishel Cover Art by Jeff Easley This book introduces the good knight Gregor and his struggle with the evil skeleton king, Nightshade. You are his brother, Erik, a younger boy accompanying him. In addition elves, dwarves, magic users, and zombies, this book includes lesser known creatures that are featured in the Dungeons and Dragons Monster Manual, such as stirges and an umberhulk. Well-respected TSR artist Jeff Easley's cover painting features a boy on a brown, winged horse being chased by the mosquito/bird-like stirges. 3\\\\. Shadowcastle Written by Michael Gray Illustrated by Mario Macari, Jr. Cover Art by Clyde Caldwell Once again, this book features Nightshade and Sir Gregor, the Good Knight of the Golden Dragon, as he is referred to in this book. You are a girl, Molly, who is out picking berries when a halfling stumbles across her and asks for her help in rescuing his brother from the evil Nightshade. Includes creatures like bullywogs, an umberhulk, and various elementals (water, rock) magically summoned to aid the forces of good. Well- respected TSR artist Clyde Caldwell's cover painting features Molly, Thistle (the halfling), and a dragon that appears to be entirely made out of fire. While there is no such creature in the book, there are elementals and there is a red dragon (actually a good wizard in disguise). In the interior illustrations of the book, Macari Jr.'s slightly more cutesy characters present a mild contrast to Michael Fishel's work in the previous book. 4\\\\. Keep of the Ancient King Written by Michael Carr Illustrated by Michael Fishel Cover Art by Keith Parkinson You are a girl who's beloved horse Acorn has been stolen by the Shadow Rider, a servant of Nightshade. Once again, You join Gregor the Good Knight in journeying to a castle and fighting monsters, but this time the Shadow Rider tries to tempt you with the promise of Acorn's safe return in exchange for betraying Gregor. 5\\\\. Dungeon of Darkness Written by John Kendall Illustrated by Pamela Summertree Cover Art by Ben Otero You must join Gregor the Good Knight of the Golden Dragon in rescuing your fellow villagers from Nightshade and the Shadow Rider. 6\\\\. Star Rangers and the Spy Written by Jean Blashfield and Beverly Charette Illustrated by Mario Macari, Jr. Cover Art by Joe DeVelasco This book is set in the science fiction world of the Star Frontiers game world. You are Ranger Chaylo, a human boy who is a member of a club called the Star Rangers. Your fellow rangers are other children, all of them alien. Rama is a female apelike Yazarian, Carrel is an insect-like Vrusk, and Gogol is an amoeba-like but intelligent, humanoid Dralasite. There is also Nanny Navigator Robot. The small white Boxils also appear in this book. These alien races are all frequently used in the Star Frontiers role-playing game, and the personalities of the Star Ranger children are, in a general sense, similar to the personality traits usually associated with their respecting species in the role-playing game. The goal of the story is to stop MR. Drel, one of your father's co-workers, from stealing an experimental starship and giving it to the Sathar, another popular Star Frontiers alien, who will then use it to invade other planets. The adults at Star Fleet do not believe the Star Ranger's warnings. Your father is also mentioned as being a scientist and a member of the United Planets, and the planet on which the book takes place is your home planet of Nedram. 7\\\\. Castle in the Clouds Written By Morris Simon Illustrated by Gary Williams Cover art by Jeff Easley \\"You\\" are a girl named Mary in your grandparents house. A Booka named Faja invites you to help an elf named Dani. Will you trust the Perlon pixie, sylph, dragon, titan, or the lammasu?

It ended with the Commonwealth withdrawing its claims on Moldavia.God's Playground: The origins to 1795 by Norman Davies p ==Background== Traditionally, Moldavia had been a subject of the Kingdom of Poland, and later the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth. As the Ottoman influence grew in the 16th century, they had become more and more interested in the region. From the end of the 16th century and the beginning of the 17th century, the magnates of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth intervened in the affairs of Moldavia, which the Ottoman Empire considered within its sphere of influence. Additionally, the Ottomans were aggravated by the constant raids of Cossacks, then nominally subjects of the Commonwealth, across the border into Ottoman territories. Another reason causing the war was the recent outbreak of the Thirty Years' War, and the request of support from the Protestant rebel leaders in Bohemia. At the time, the Thirty Years' War was raging across Europe. Gabriel Bethlen, prince of Transylvania saw an opportunity to unite the two Hungarian principalities, Transylvania and Royal Hungary, and sacked Vienna in November 1619. He also asked Sultan Osman II for aid, but this was unsuccessful. The Commonwealth was relatively uninvolved in this war but the Polish king, Zygmunt III Waza, sent an elite and ruthless mercenary unit, the Lisowczycy, to aid his Habsburg allies. They defeated the Hungarian lord George R√°k√≥czi at the Battle of Humenn√© in 1619, and thus, cut the supply lines of Transylvanian forces. Then Gaspar Graziani, ruler of Moldavia, switched sides and joined Poland. Thus, the sultan agreed to help Bethlen, gathering a large Ottoman army with the intent of a punitive invasion of the Commonwealth. ==The war== In 1620, the Ottoman forces crushed the Commonwealth army at the Battle of ≈¢u≈£ora (Cecora). The campaign was suspended for the winter but, in 1621, both sides resumed hostilities. In 1621, an army of 100,000‚Äì250,000 soldiers (sources vary), led by Osman II, advanced from Constantinople and Edirne in April, towards the Polish frontier. The Polish army had 8,280 hussars, 8,200 cossack style cavalry (light cavalry), 1,400 Lisowski cavalry, 2,160 western cavalry, 6,800 Polish infantry, 5,800 western infantry, 800 Hungarian infantry and 25,000 Zaporozhian Cossacks. The Turks, following their victory in the Battle of ≈¢u≈£ora, had high hopes of conquering Ukraine (then a part of Poland), and perhaps even toppling the Commonwealth entirely and reaching the Baltic Sea. This time, however, they were stopped by a Commonwealth army, aided by a large Cossack detachment, at the Battle of Khotyn. The 65,000 Poles and Cossacks were able to withstand an Ottoman army three times the size throughout the month of September. When the Polish cavalry rallied forth in October they broke the will of the besiegers and the Sultan sued for peace.Davies, God's Playground: A History of Poland, v. 1 (1981). The ensuing peace treaty resulted in no border change but the Commonwealth agreed to stop its interference in Moldavia. Both sides claimed victory, as the Commonwealth saw the battle of Khotyn as a successful stopping of the Ottoman invasion of its mainland and the Ottoman Empire achieved its goal of removing the impending threat on the Moldavian lands. The Polish‚ÄìOttoman border would remain relatively peaceful until the Polish‚ÄìOttoman War (1633‚Äì34) and the Polish‚ÄìOttoman War (1672‚Äì76). ==See also== *Moldavian Magnate Wars ==NotesReferences== * Wojny polsko- tureckie, Encyklopedia WIEM * ==External links== *Polish Warfare: 1618‚Äì1621 War with Turkey * Wojna 1620‚Äì1621 * WOJNY POLSKO TURECKIE W PIERWSZEJ PO≈ÅOWIE XVII WIEKU Category:1620s conflicts Category:Wars involving Moldavia Category:Polish‚ÄìOttoman wars Category:Wars involving Wallachia Category:Warfare of the Early Modern era Category:1620 in Europe Category:1621 in Europe Category:1620 in the Ottoman Empire Category:1621 in the Ottoman Empire ","title":"Polish‚ÄìOttoman War (1620‚Äì21)"},{"id":"12369285","text":"is an extended play by Japanese pop band Pizzicato Five, released on April 21, 1999 by Readymade Records. ==Track listingCharts== {class=\\" plainrowheaders sortable\\" center;\\" border=\\"1\\" !scope=\\"col\\" Chart (1999) !scope=\\"col\\" Peak position - !scope=\\"row\\" Japan (Oricon)  38 } ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:1999 EPs Category:Pizzicato Five EPs Category:Nippon Columbia albums Category:Japanese-language EPs ","title":"Darlin' of Discoth√®que"},{"id":"12369289","text":"Charles Stevenson (1908-1979) was an American analytic philosopher.

The spoon itself ranges from 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.5 cm) long and has a circular bowl measuring approximately 0.5 to 0.75 inches (1.25 to 2 cm). They can be found in a wide range of materials including glass, Sterling silver, plastic, wood, ivory, bone and shell. As a unit of measurement in old recipes, 1 salt spoon (ssp) = 0.25 teaspoon, or slightly more than 1 ml. Salt absorbs moisture from its surroundings, and had a tendency to clump together into one large lump. The head of the household usually presided over the distribution of salt at the dining table. This lump of salt was placed into a small dish, called by various names - open salt, salt cellar, table salt. Today we also refer to these as Master salts. It was then broken up with a knife handle or other utensil and placed into smaller, individual salt cellars, often matching the larger one in design. Since it was such a precious seasoning, only small portions were given to each person at the table. The food was either dipped into the small individual salt cellars or was scooped out with the small salt spoons and sprinkled over the food. In the early 1930s, a process was developed which literally coats each grain of salt and keeps it from sticking together. Due to these changes in the processing of salt for consumer use, the open salt cellar and its accompanying salt spoon have become largely obsolete, having been replaced by the everyday salt shakers. They are, however, a highly collectable item and are still used today as a bit of nostalgia on many dining tables. ==Notes== Category:Spoons Category:Serving utensils ","title":"Salt spoon"},{"id":"12369322","text":"David John Rainford (born 21 April 1979) is an English former footballer.

The only solution at the time was to begin production of original designs. The order to design and produce the first Italian tanks was accepted by the FIAT automobile company in 1916. The prototype of the new tank was displayed to a military commission on 21 June 1917; its mechanical systems were complete but its superstructure was added later, being represented on the prototype by a wooden mockup with a conical open turret and dummy gun. The final configuration of the superstructure was not completed until 1918. ==Description== The FIAT 2000 was a substantial vehicle, of comparable dimensions to the British Mark V tanks, and weighing 40 tons as compared to the Mark V's 28 tons. The driver was seated at the front, with very good overall vision consisting of a large port forward and small lateral loopholes. The layout of the FIAT 2000 differed to the other tanks then in use, especially the British ones. The engine was separated from the crew; not placed behind the crew compartment as modern tanks, but below it. The mechanical layout was also interesting and innovative, comprising a FIAT Aviazione A12, water-cooled 240 hp engine with 6 cylinders driving the tracks through a transverse transmission. The fuel capacity was 600 - 1,000 liters, but this gave only 75 km range on paved roads. The tracks were longer than the hull, but were lower in comparison to the wrap-around type found on the British 'rhomboidal' tanks and thus lower in weight. The armour was of clean design, being made of riveted steel plates. It was 15 mm thick on the sides and 20 mm on the front. Armament originally consisted of the turret mounted gun and ten machineguns (three on each side and four in front), but this left the rear of the tank undefended and tended to contaminate the interior with propellant fumes, so it was decided to install a ventilator in the roof and alter the machinegun positions to two on each side, three at the rear, and two in front. Perhaps the most interesting feature of the tank's weaponry was the turret; apart from the Renault FT, this was the first tank to have a rotating turret mounted above the hull. The turret was made of four pieces rivetted together and had room enough for two crew members. Its weapon was a 65/17 howitzer (of 65mm caliber with a barrel 17 calibers long). Thanks to the tall turret and the space available beneath it, the gun's elevation was -10/+75¬∞. ==Service== This tank was often called 'the heaviest World War I tank' but this is not strictly accurate, since the FIAT 2000 never actually saw combat in World War I. Also, the modest order for 50 tanks was never completed, the only tanks produced being two prototypes. After the war the FIAT 2000 was displayed as one of the weapons used 'to defeat the enemy' and the two prototypes completed were sent to Libya to fight guerrilla forces, together with other tanks bought from France, in a special unit, the Tank battery (1¬∞ Batteria autonoma carri d'assalto). In Libya, the FIAT tank proved capable of an average speed of 4 km/h, and so, after two months its career ended, being unable to keep up with rapid movement of the enemy. One remained in Tripoli and the other was sent to Italy in the spring of 1919, where it performed before the King at Rome Stadium. The tank put on a convincing display: it climbed a 1.1 m wall, then faced another 3.5 m wall, which it knocked down with its weight. Then a trench of 3 m width was successfully crossed and several trees were knocked down. This impressive performance failed to revive interest in the heavy tank and so it was abandoned. The surviving FIAT 2000 at Rome was left in a depot for several years, until it was sent on the orders of Colonel Maltese to Forte Tiburtino, risking to catch fire during the travel. In 1934 it was seen again in a Campo Dux parade, having been repainted and even rearmed, with two 37/40 mm guns instead of the forward machine guns. It was later reportedly transformed into a monument at Bologna, after that its fate is unknown, like the other tank. ==Replica== A project aimed at building a full-sized working replica of the Fiat 2000 has been created in March 2017 by volunteers, meaning to raise the necessary funds with crowdfunding. From June 2017 to October 2018 the committee worked on remaking a complete set of blueprints, after which the construction of the replica started on 15 November 2018. As of November 2019, the work is ongoing and proceeding steadily. ==Sources== * Pignato, Nicola, Storia dei mezzi corazzati, Fratelli Fabbri editori, 1976, pag. 81-88. ==See also== * Fiat 3000 ==ReferencesExternal links== * The Advanced Fiat 2000 Heavy Tank(Dead link) * History of the Italian Tank Corps * Photogallery Category:World War I tanks of Italy Category:Heavy tanks 2000 ","title":"Fiat 2000"},{"id":"12369402","text":"Charles Chapman may refer to: ==Entertainment== * Charles Chapman (guitarist) (1950/1951‚Äì2011), American guitarist * Charles Shepard Chapman (1879‚Äì1962), American painter * C.

Coppola. In 1989, he legally changed his name to Iron Thunderhorse (Biwabiko Paddaquahas in Quinnipiac), citing cultural, religious, and traditional reasons. Reportedly in keeping with Quinnipiac tradition, Thunderhorse says this name was chosen by four elders, including Slow Turtle (John Peters). Thunderhorse's mother was Norma Patricia Brown, a grand niece of Sakaskantawe (Flying Squirrel Woman). In ALGONQUIN EAGLE SONG: An Informal \\"Honor Roll\\" of Great Algonquins, Evan T. Pritchard writes, \\"Iron Thunderhorse is a direct descendant of Elizabeth Sakaskantawe [Mahweeyeuh/Brown] (the last matriarch of the Quinnipiac's Totoket Band) of the people of southwestern Connecticut, who were among the first ‚Ä¶ to be driven from their land.\\"Algonquin Eagle Song, by Evan Pritchard, Center of Algonquin Culture, Resonance Communications, P.O. Box 1028, Woodstock, NY. 2000. Thunderhorse's father was an immigrant from Naples, Italy, and his stepfather was an Ojibway from Quebec, Canada. By age 12, Thunderhorse reports he had been exposed to six languages (English, Italian, Latin, French-Canadian, Anishinabemowin, and Quiripi) by his relatives. Thunderhorse traces his passion for honoring and preserving the language and traditions of his Native American ancestor to his childhood time with Sakaskantawe. She was in her mid-90s to early 100s when she taught Thunderhorse 100 basic words of the Quiripi language, various Quiripi traditions, and the importance of learning and preserving them. ==Controversy and incarceration== Allegations have been made that Iron Thunderhorse is not truly Native American;http://www.nativewayproductions.com/Iron_Thunderhorse.htm (no longer available, 2012)http://www.bluecorncomics.com/newage.htm however, no evidence has been offered with any of these allegations. Iron Thunderhorse was incarcerated by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice in 1978. In 1977, he was convicted of the charges of aggravated kidnapping, aggravated rape, aggravated robbery; and in 1991 convicted of a charge of escape. His maximum sentence was set at 99 years.https://offender.tdcj.texas.gov/OffenderSearch/offenderDetail.action?sid=02408848 In June 2014, shortly after being paroled to a halfway house in Houston, TX, Mr. Thunderhorse pulled off his electronic monitoring anklet and fled to the New Haven, CT, area. In August 2014, when Mr. Thunderhorse attempted to use a 20 year old ID to withdraw money from the Chase Bank in downtown New Haven, a bank employee did an internet search on him and discovered he was a fugitive from Texas and alerted local police who arrested him. Mr. Thunderhorse fought extradition to Texas, but the Supreme Court denied his claims of sovereign immunity and ordered him returned to TX in January 2015.\\"Legally blind man leaves halfway house\\", Craig Hlavaty, Houston Chronicle, 2014-06-26, http://www.chron.com/houston/article/Legally-blind-man-leaves-halfway- house-5581808.php\\"Quinnipiac tribe member returns to New Haven, faces uncertain future following arrest\\", Randall Beach, New Haven Register, 2014-08-29 http://www.nhregister.com/general-news/20140829/quinnipiac-tribe- member-returns-to-new-haven-faces-uncertain-future-following-arrest\\"New Haven native Iron Thunderhorse fights extradition to Texas\\", Randall Beach, New Haven Register, 2014-11-06 http://www.nhregister.com/article/NH/20141106/NEWS/141109685\\"Judge sends Iron Thunderhorse back to Texas\\", Daniel Tepfer, The Connecticut Post, 2015-01-28 http://www.ctpost.com/local/article/Judge-sends-Iron-Thunderhorse-back-to- Texas-6046692.php ==Human Rights Advocate== Early in his incarceration, Thunderhorse became a certified paralegal. He served as Editor for Thunderbird Free Press (Native American tribes' and prisoners' rights), and as Briefing Editor for the Prison Law Monitor. His first published work in legal forums was Breaking the Chains (Inside/Out Press, Fresno, CA, 1983) about the history and jurisprudence of self-representation in America. He wrote exclusive columns on prison law in Easyriders, Biker Lifestyle, Iron Horse, Guild Notes, and Voice for the Defense. Thunderhorse was active in the RUIZ VS. ESTELLE prison reform litigation as a class Plaintiff. In 1981, the presiding Judge, William Wayne Justice, appointed Vince Nathan as Special Master to monitor compliance with the court's mandates. Mr. Nathan was to study official retaliation against \\"jailhouse lawyers\\" and Thunderhorse was one of those interviewed by him at the Ellis Unit. Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) officials declined to release Iron's central file and Mr. Nathan had to petition the Court for sanctions against TDCJ.Ray Mariotti, Ed. \\"Prison officials should cooperate,\\" Austin American Statesman, November 28, 1981, p.

Thunderhorse also co-founded The Thunderbird Alliance, a coalition of Tribes, Medicine Societies, Support Groups, and prison circles to address the many problems faced by Native American religious adherents behind prison walls. He served as Editor-in-Chief for The Thunderbird Free Press, the quarterly forum for the Thunderbird Alliance. Humanity & Society, a journal of humanist socialogy, published a special issue about Native American struggles and two Thunderbird Alliance Advocates (one of whom was Thunderhorse), which included an essay on the legacy of the Thunderbird Alliance, from its tribal roots.\\"The Thunderbird Alliance: Reclaiming the Legacy of Tribal Democracy,\\" by Iron Thunderhorse, Humanity & Society, 1989 (reprinted in Humanity & Society Special 25th Anniversary Issue, Part One, Featuring Selected Articles from the 1970's and 1980's, Volume 27, No. 3, August 2003, pp. 425ff.).

ECOS requested assistance from ACQTC, Inc. and Thunderhorse filed a Motion to Intervene as the Legal Sovereign of ACQTC, Inc., and submitted an 86-page multidisciplinary study about the sites. Eventually, Attorney General Richard Blumenthal indicated he would file for a permanent injunction after Thunderhorse pointed out that the original donors of the land did so with the stipulation that the Parks be used for the public (precluding a golf course for the wealthy).\\"Parks buried past: Some say Hartman project could violate sacred American Indian sites,\\" Stamford Advocate, September 24, 2001.

In 2003, Thunderhorse, who is now legally blind, filed a Pro Se litigation under the ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) about the conditions in Texas prisons, because they reportedly did not adequately accommodate disabled prisoners. This led to an investigation by ADVOCACY, Inc. In late 2004, Thunderhorse filed suit in Pro Se under the RLUIPA (Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act) after TDCJ defendants reportedly violated three previous out-of-court settlements. When the U.S. Magistrate Judge ruled against Thunderhorse,See this copy of the judgement which is posted on the Native American Rights Fund website (narf.org). he appealed to the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans.

His book, Return of the Thunderbeings (by Iron Thunderhorse and Donn LeVie, Jr., Santa Fe, Bear & Co., 1990, ), has chapters on Shamanic art and is full of symbols and designs used as iconography in tribal arts and crafts. All of Thunderhorse's books, booklets, and scholarly studies contain his line drawings, maps, and charts. Four of his illustrations appear in Voices of Native AmericaHap Gilliland, Ed., Voices of Native America, Kendall/Hunt Publishing Company, Dubuque, 1997, and he designed the cover for his only authorized biography, Following the Footprints of a Stone Giant: The Life and Times of Iron Thunderhorse. Iron's artistic work has been collected by tribes, museums, and private collectors in the US, Canada, and abroad. His historical pictographic portraiture of Tecumseh is on display at the Museums at Prophetstown State Park in Lafayette, Indiana. His masks are in the private collections of Barbara Hand Clow, David Wagner, and Yehwehnode. At the Indian Trading Post and Powwow Museum, just south of Indianapolis, Indiana, many Thunderhorse originals were on display for several years. Other works have been on display in Louisville, Kentucky; New York City; Orange, Texas; and elsewhere. A permanent exhibit of Iron's maps and portraits reside at the Quinnipiac Dawnland Museum in Guilford, Connecticut, while a large collection of his work remains at the ACQTC National Office in Milltown, Indiana. At gatherings, his creations have been used as educational tools in CT, IN, NY, and Quebec, Canada. To help raise funds and awareness, he has donated paintings to worthy groups such as the Eastern Puma Research Association in Baltimore, Maryland. ==Linguist== Thunderhorse has written bilingual poetry in numerous Algonquian language dialects and has published many scholarly papers on linguistics in the Dawnlander, the ACQTC Literary Journal (annual). In 2000, Thunderhorse developed a 100-page Quiripi language guide. In 2006 he published a 295-page revised and expanded edition, A Complete Guide for Learning, Speaking, and Writing The PEA-A Wampano-Quiripi R-Dialect (QTC Press, ACLI Series). See the list below for other published books, articles, and unpublished manuscripts concerning Native American languages and writing systems. ==Author== A more complete bibliography of works written by Thunderhorse (c. 1985‚Äì2005) appears on pages 94‚Äì103 of Following the Footprints of a Stone Giant: The Life and Times of Iron Thunderhorse (by Ruth Mahweeyeuh Thunderhorse, Infinity Publishing.com, 2007. ).

It ended in 1676 with the Treaty of ≈ªurawno and the Commonwealth ceding control of most of its Ukraine territories to the Empire. ==Prelude== The causes of the Polish-Ottoman War of 1672‚Äì1676 can be traced to 1666. Petro Doroshenko Hetman of Zaporizhian Host, aiming to gain control of Ukraine but facing defeats from other factions struggling over control of that region, in a final bid to preserve his power in Ukraine, signed a treaty with Sultan Mehmed IV in 1669 that recognized the Cossack Hetmanate as a vassal of the Ottoman Empire.Finkel, C., 2005, Osman's Dream, Cambridge: Basic Books, In the meantime, Commonwealth forces were trying to put down unrest in Ukraine, but were weakened by decades long wars (Khmelnytsky Uprising, The Deluge and Russo-Polish War (1654‚Äì1667)). Trying to capitalize on that weakness, Tatars, who commonly raided across the Commonwealth borders in search of loot and plunder, invaded, this time allying themselves with Cossacks under hetman Doroshenko. They were however stopped by Commonwealth forces under hetman John Sobieski, who stopped their first push (1666‚Äì67), defeating them several times, and finally gaining an armistice after the Battle of Podhajce. In 1670, however, hetman Doroshenko tried once again to take over Ukraine, and in 1671 Khan of Crimea, Adil Giray, supportive of the Commonwealth, was replaced with a new one, Selim I Giray, by the Ottoman sultan. Selim entered into an alliance with the Doroshenko's Cossacks; but again like in 1666‚Äì67 the Cossack-Tatar forces were dealt defeats by Sobieski. Selim then renewed his oath of allegiance to the Ottoman Sultan and pleaded for assistance, to which the Sultan agreed. Thus an irregular border conflict escalated into a regular war in 1671, as the Ottoman Empire was now prepared to send its regular units onto the battlefield in a bid to try to gain control of that region for itself.Tucker, S.C., editor, 2010, A Global Chronology of Conflict, Vol. Two, Santa Barbara: ABC-CLIO, LLC, ==The first phase (1672)== Ottoman forces, numbering 80,000 men and led by Grand Vizier K√∂pr√ºl√º Fazƒ±l Ahmed and Ottoman sultan Mehmed IV, invaded Polish Ukraine in August, took the Commonwealth fortress at Kamieniec Podolski and besieged Lw√≥w. Unprepared for war, and torn by internal conflict between the king Michael I and the szlachta nobility, the Commonwealth Sejm could not act to raise taxes and gather a larger army. Its representatives were forced to sign the Peace of Buczacz in October that year, which ceded to the Ottomans the Commonwealth part of Ukraine (the Right-bank Brac≈Çaw Voivodeship, Podole Voivodeship and part of Kiev Voivodeship; Left- bank Ukraine was already controlled by Muscovy since the Treaty of Andrusovo of 1667) and promised an annual tribute of 22,000 ducats. ==The second phase (1673‚Äì1676)== Battle Over the Turkish Banner by J√≥zef Brandt. Instead of ratifying the peace treaty, the Commonwealth Sejm, with most of the deputies finally united by anger due to the territorial losses and the demeaning tribute (which could in fact be seen as reducing the Commonwealth to Ottomans' vassal) finally raised taxes for a new army (of about 37,000 strong was raised) and increased the Cossack register to 40,000. Hetman John Sobieski led a military campaign against the Ottomans and dealt several defeats to the Ottomans; of which the battle of Khotyn was the largest; next he took control of the Moldavia territory and most of disputed Ukrainian lands. That year king Michael I of Poland died, and in recognition of his victories and dedication, John Sobieski was elected King of the Commonwealth in 1674. Folding of the standards by J√≥zef Brandt. Over the next year, however, the Polish forces were subject to attrition, as the Sejm again refused to raise taxes and pay the army, resulting in mass desertions of unpaid soldiery. The Polish problems were further aggravated by the incompetent leadership of hetman Micha≈Ç Kazimierz Pac, who obstructed Sobieski's leadership, while the Ottomans continued to receive reinforcements. Nonetheless in 1674 the Commonwealth resumed the offensive, taking advantage of a new Muscovy‚ÄìOttoman conflict that year, and the Polish-Ottoman war remained undecided. Sobieski's force of 6,000 defeated 20,000 Turks and Tatars under Ibrahim Shyshman in the battle of Lwow in August 1675. Even after the Battle of Trembowla, the Sejm still refused his pleas for more funds and a larger army. In 1676, after Sobieski's 16,000 withstood the two-week siege of ≈ªurawno, by 100,000 men under Ibrahim Pasha, a new peace treaty was signed, the Treaty of ≈ªurawno. The peace treaty partially reversing those from Buczacz: the Ottomans kept approximately two thirds of the territories they gained in 1672, and the Commonwealth no longer was obliged to pay any kind of tribute to the Empire; a large number of Polish prisoners were released by the Ottomans. ==Aftermath== J√≥zef Brandt, Attack of the Cavalry Coffin portrait of captain Zygmunt Dziembowski, who died during the war against Ottoman Empire on December 16th, 1674 The Sejm rejected the treaty, through the actions of Austrian diplomats and Pope Innocent XI. Sobieski also was forced to reduce his army from 30,000 to 12,000 men. The war showed the increasing weakness and disorder of the Commonwealth, who by the second half of the 17th century had started its gradual decline that would culminate a century later with the partitions of Poland. The unruly Sejm, paralyzed by liberum veto and foreign bribery, was dominated by politicians who thought in short term gains only and constantly refused the funds to raise an army, as it appeared that most of the Commonwealth would not be ravaged by the Ottoman armies. Even after the unfavourable Buczacz treaty, which convinced the Sejm to raise the taxes, once initial successes were achieved, the majority of the Sejm again couldn't be convinced to keep up the pressure on the enemy; soldiers were left unpaid and desertions on a mass scale negatively affected the Polish cause. This apparent inability to defend itself, also seen in the other recent and future conflicts the Commonwealth was involved in, increasingly invited foreign forces to prey on the Commonwealth. On the Polish side the fighting was done mostly by a force privately financed by John Sobieski. He gained reputation as an able, courageous commander and a patriot, having invested part of his personal fortune in the defense of the Commonwealth.

After establishing the company in Harlem in 1946, he kept the offices and garage in the same neighborhood, even as his client roster began to represent the elite of Fifth Avenue. ==Early life== Zanders was born in Valdosta, Georgia, on July 13, either 1910 or 1912,New York, New York Guard Service Cards, 1906-1918, 1940-1948 for Roosevelt S Zanders to the alleged Reverend Arthur Zanders and his wife, Ethel Smith Zanders. His father was actually a barber. During his childhood, he won a marbles shooting championship in Georgia and often competed in official games. When he was still a child, his family began relocating to Youngstown, Ohio, where Zanders attended the public schools. On November 3, 1919 his father killed his mother Ethel and a younger brother named Henry with a shotgun, and then shot himself after returning from a trip.http://cdm.georgiaarchives.org:2011/cdm/singleitem/collection/gadeaths/id/22998/rec/3http://cdm.georgiaarchives.org:2011/cdm/singleitem/collection/gadeaths/id/23001/rec/4http://cdm.georgiaarchives.org:2011/cdm/singleitem/collection/gadeaths/id/23000/rec/5 With both parents dead, Zanders took a position as a locker room attendant at the Mahoning Valley Country Club to help support himself and his four siblings.

May 1998. ==Career== Zanders was working as a construction engineer on the Alcan Highway in Canada when he developed the concept of offering combined limousine and concierge services, based on his difficulty in obtaining simple things that weren't readily available. He reasoned that travelers would find themselves in a strange environment and need someone to help obtain things they wanted, as well. Zanders had established his limousine service and was gaining prominence with his concept of personal service by the mid-1950s and was noted to go beyond expectation to provide what amounted to a concierge service to his clients.Paonessa, Dan. \\"Genie with a Limousine: The Story of Roosevelt Smith Zanders, Zanders Auto Rental Service, Inc.\\".

It is situated on the banks of the River Clare, 47 km from Galway City, 11 km from Tuam on the N17 road to Sligo. ==History== The parish of Milltown is made up of the two civil parishes of Adergoole and Liskeevy,http://milltowngalway.com both of which are of medieval origin. The first historical record of Milltown dates back to 1589. According to historian Hubert Thomas Knox's History of Mayo, Sir Murrogh O'Flaherty and his army came to attack Edward Birmingham. They stormed the castle, burnt half of Milltown and destroyed the castle's corn, but still failed to capture the castle after a bloody battle. On their return to Cong, they burnt sixteen other villages and seized three thousand cattle. The placename of Milltown or Baile an Mhuilinn (the town of the mill), is derived from the two mills located on the River Clare - O'Grady's mill at Milltown, and Birmingham's mill at Lack. O'Grady's mill was demolished in the 1950s during the Corrib River Drainage Scheme, while the ruins of Birmingham's mill can still be seen along the river. The Birmingham mill was a corn and tuck mill. It was noted in the valuation office Mill Brook records of the 1850s as having one pair of mill stones, a water wheel of 14 feet in diameter and valued at ¬£2. The resident miller at the time was John Farrell. Lurgan Canoe In August 1902, a Bronze Age logboat was found in Lurgan Bog, by a local farmer.https://milltown.galwaycommunityheritage.org/content/topics/lurgan- canoe The boat was found while a bog drain was being deepened. Upon finding the fifty feet long boat, the find was reported to Sir Thomas Esmonde of the Royal Irish Academy. Esmonde visited Lurgan and bought the boat for ¬£25. The canoe was moved from Lurgan to Milltown Railway Station by workmen. From there, it was taken by rail to The National Museum of Ireland in Dublin where it can still be viewed today. The Lurgan Canoe is the oldest, intact logboat ever found in Western Europe. It is speculated by experts that the boat was made for ceremonial display, as it is considered too long to have been used for ordinary fishing or transport. The boat is radiocarbon dated to 2200 BC. It is likely to have been hollowed from a large oak tree, of a type which no longer exist today.  Bardic School of Kilclooney Kilclooney Castle was once the home of the √ì hUig√≠n bardic family and was occupied by Domhnall √ì hUiginn in 1574. Tadhg Dall √ì h√öig√≠nn refers to a school of poetry here in the 16th Century. It is stated that seventeen poets of Ulster's brightest progeny sought learning in Ceall Cluaine, while it is also reputed that students from Scotland may have studied there. Each student studied fil√≠ocht (poetry) for 12 years, in a school year lasting from November to March. It is said each student had his own stone hut where he could meditate on a prescribed theme before reciting his composition to his fellow students and tutor the following day. Brian, Hugh and Tully √ì hUig√≠n held three parts of Kilclooney in 1641 but their lands were granted to William Burke at the Restoration in the 1660s. A large portion of the castle can be seen today in quite a ruinous state, while there is no evidence of the stone huts. The foundation of a grassed-over rectangular building is also present. Milltown Races The Milltown Races date back to 1877,https://milltown.galwaycommunityheritage.org/content/topics/the-tuam- herald/grew-cheltenham-festival-racing however; earlier race meetings date back as far as the 1840s organised by the local gentry held at the Race Park in Dalgin. These races were originally held on St. Patrick's Day but were later changed to Easter Monday at the turn of the century in hope of better weather conditions. The races saw thousands of people from all over Connacht each year. Local publicans were organisers of the races and The Tuam Herald reported that \\"Porter ran in rivers down countless throats and corked concoctions sold by the million\\". By the 1930s, the races began to decline and were abandoned during World War II. They were revived again in 1952 but failed to attract past crowds. The last race meeting was held in 1966. A carnival was organised in 1957 to begin on Easter Sunday and continue for two weeks in an effort to boost attendance numbers. Popular Showbands of the day performed at the carnival but increasing costs led to the death of the carnival. The final one was held in 1981. War of Independence The Irish War of Independence lasted from 1919 to 1921. When hostilities broke out in 1919, the Milltown IRA company numbered between 30 and 40 men. Milltown was witness to two IRA ambushes, now known locally as the Egg Shed Ambush and the Cnoc√°n M√≥r Ambush.https://milltown.galwaycommunityheritage.org/content/townlands/milltown- heritage-park/slide-show/milltown-heritage-3 The egg shed in Milltown is a small shed with a red door and a sloped roof, located in front of the housing estate at Millbrook. The egg shed was once used for sorting and storing eggs for collection by egg buyers from other regions. In April 1921, two RIC constables returning to their barracks after patrolling the railway station, were attacked by local volunteers at the egg shed. The ambush was carried out by ten to twelve local men to take the policemen's rifles and ammunition. However; it was not long before a number of armed policemen and Black and Tans rushed to the scene from the nearby police barracks and managed to retrieve the rifles. The Cnoc√°n M√≥r Ambush occurred on 27 June 1921 on the Milltown- Tuam road. A flying column of seven local volunteers under the command of Tom Dunleavy, lay in wait for a combined RIC and Black and Tan patrol. Two members of the patrol were killed, Sergeant James Murrin and Constable Edgar Day, while a policeman was wounded and a Black and Tan named Carter escaped. Sergeant Murrin was to have retired on a pension a week earlier but due to a problem with his final documentation, he was required to remain at his post. Constable Day was a young man from Nottingham. After the Cnoc√°n M√≥r Ambush, many arrests were made and many of those arrested were beaten. The Black and Tans carried out cruel reprisals by setting fire to the house of David Flannery in Liskeavy, but thankfully the fire was put out by family members and neighbours before it became too severe. However; the Hannon family of Belmont fared much worse as their home was burned to the ground. Curfew was also imposed. Civil War The Irish Civil War lasted from 1922 to 1923. The cause of the conflict was a split over the Anglo-Irish Treaty (1921) between those who supported it (Pro-Treaty), and those who opposed it (Anti- Treaty). A number of local men who had fought side by side during the War of Independence now fought each other. The most renowned incident of the Civil War in the locality took place at the gates of Milbrook House in an event later to become known as The Grand Gates Ambush. A petty session's clerk, James McDonagh from the Conagher townland was suspected by local Fenians to be a Police Spy. Allegedly, Joe Dalton, manager of McDonnell's Store (later Glynn's shop) engaged in conversation with McDonagh at the bar until McDonagh had become intoxicated. Dalton's barman named Roche and a number of other local Fenians set up an ambush at Milbrook. While McDonagh was then walking home drunk, he was killed at the Gates of Milbrook house. Roche emigrated to America shortly afterwards to avoid prosecution. ==Transport== Milltown railway station opened on 30 April 1894 and closed on 17 June 1963. Milltown was one of the stations on the Western Railway Corridor. It was located between Tuam and Claremorris. As of 2009, there were plans to re-open the line and station with funding from the Irish government's \\"Transport 21\\" programme. Milltown is served by the N17 road from Tuam to Sligo. ==Religion== The present parish of Milltown was formed with the unification of the parishes of Adergoole and Liskeavy at some point between the years 1704 and 1801. Prior to this, Liskeavy and Adergoole were separate parishes with churches in each, while there was no church in Milltown. In 1803, a thatched oblong church was built in Kilclooney measuring approximately eighty feet by twenty. A much smaller church was also built around the same time as Kilclooney in the townland of Kilerneen or Drim. https://milltown.galwaycommunityheritage.org/content/townlands/st-josephs- church/milltowns-new-church The old church in Milltown was built in 1831 on a site provided by the Bodkin landlord family. This church was replaced by the present St. Joseph's Church in Milltown which was built in 1969/70. The construction of the church cost ¬£75,000 and was designed by John Thompson and Partners, Limerick. The stained glass windows in the church were designed by George Walsh and painted by William Earley. St. Patrick's Church, Ballyglass serves the Mayo area of the parish and was erected in 1879. It is believed to have been constructed on the site of an earlier thatched Penal Church. The stained glass windows of the church were designed by Joshua Clarke of Dublin, father of artist Harry Clarke. Cemeterys in use in Milltown are located in Kilclooney, Adergoole and Kilgevrin. ==Sport== Gaelic Football Milltown GAA is the local Gaelic Athletic Association club which was established in 1953. The home ground is Fr. Conroy Park. Milltown have won the Galway Senior Football Championship on two occasions - 1971 and 1981. Milltown players have included Noel Tierney, Gay McManus and Joe Waldron. Milltown Ladies' Gaelic Football club was founded in 1998. Underage teams play in the Galway league and championship and the first team compete at Intermediate level. The ladies' team have won a number of Kilmacud Crokes All-Ireland 7-Aside tournaments in both the Junior and Intermediate grades respectively. Handball The original proposal of a construction of a handball alley in Milltown was made in the 1800s. In the 1920s and '30s, handball was more popular than football. From May to October, the alley was occupied all day on Sundays and also during the long summer evenings. During the Second World War, handballs became impossible to obtain and the sport began to decline, never regaining popularity. ==Amenities== There is also a 550-metre walk along the River Clare, for which the Local Development Association has won a number of awards.Milltown Ireland Milltown Galway Milltown County Galway Milltown Co Galway It also has a 4.5 km Sl√≠ na Sl√°inte rural walk, for which it won first place in County Galway in the National Tidy Town Awards for 8 years from 1996-2003.

Finally, in 1968, they opened the cave to the public for tours. However, a year later Latcham lost the cave due to foreclosure, and it was sold to a new owner who kept the cave open to the public until 1971. In 1989, John Ackerman purchased the cave, and remains the present owner. Ackerman progressively discovered five more miles of cave segments.

He and the series of films featuring him are frequently referenced in popular culture around the world.Erb, Cynthia, 1998, Tracking King Kong: A Hollywood Icon in World Culture, Wayne State University Press, . King Kong has achieved the stature of a pop-culture icon and modern myth.Jones, Preston Neal, 2002, King Kong , St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture, St. James Press, .Gunn, Dave, King Kong (1933). King Kong has inspired advertisements, cartoons, comic books, films, magazine covers, plays, poetry, political cartoons, short stories, television programmes, and other media. The forms of references to King Kong range from straight copies to parodies and humorous references. == 1930s and 1940s== The 1933 release of King Kong was an immediate hit at the box office, and had a huge impact on the popular culture of the 1930s. It was the first film to play in two of New York City's largest theatres at the same time, and the first in the 1930s trend for horror films. The combination of advanced special effects and primitivist content in the film made it popular among American and European intellectuals, especially the surrealists. Ray Bradbury remarked that when King Kong was released, \\"a mob of boys went quietly mad across the world, then fled into the light to become adventurers, explorers, zoo-keepers, filmmakers.\\" There was a version of King Kong in the 1933 animated Mickey Mouse cartoon \\"The Pet Store\\" (also known as \\"Mickey and the Gorilla Tamer\\"). In the cartoon, the ape falls in love with Minnie Mouse and climbs to the top of a stack of boxes while holding her. Mickey and a group of birds, imitating the biplanes at the climax of King Kong, defeat the ape.Glut, Donald F., 2002, The Frankenstein Archive: Essays on the Monster, the Myth, the Movies, and More, McFarland & Company, . In the 1933 animated Mickey Mouse short film, \\"Mickey's Mechanical Man\\", Mickey's invention, a robot, is engaged in a boxing match against an ape known as \\"Killer Kong\\". In 1938, King Kong received its first re-release, although some shots, such as King Kong removing parts of Ann Darrow's dress, and his chewing and stomping various extras, often in graphic close-up (via use of full-scale mechanical head and foot props), were removed because they were now considered unacceptable under the Production Code.Morton, Ray, 2005, King Kong: The History of a Movie Icon from Fay Wray to Peter Jackson, Hal Leonard, . King Kong was again re-released in 1942 and 1946. Despite its success, King Kong was not yet as important a part of popular culture as it would become in the future. The controversial World War II Dutch resistance fighter Christiaan Lindemans ‚Äì eventually arrested on suspicion of having betrayed secrets to the Nazis ‚Äì was nicknamed \\"King Kong\\" due to his being exceptionally tall., Among the Dutch, the name \\"King Kong\\" is still more often associated with him rather than with the fictional ape. ==1950s to the 1970s == The film was re-released in 1952, becoming one of the media events of that year. Time magazine named it \\"Movie of the Year\\". The film's studio RKO tried an experimental reissue of King Kong in the Midwest United States in 1952. In an unprecedented move they committed most of King Kong's promotional budget to television spots. The re- release was an enormous success, with the film attracting triple the usual business in its markets. This showed that television was a powerful tool for promotion. King Kong generated more box office receipts than the original 1933 release had. Theatre owners named it Picture of the Year. It was at this time that King Kong acquired its reputation as a popular culture phenomenon. The two most significant spinoffs of King Kong in this period were Mighty Joe Young (1949) and Godzilla (1954). Godzilla was inspired by King Kong's popularity in Japan. Godzilla revived and reconfigured parts of the King Kong story more powerfully than any other spinoff has. RKO theatrically re-released King Kong for the last time in 1956. King Kong was sold to television after the conclusion of the 1956 release. One channel in New York showed the film seventeen times in a single week, with each showing topping the ratings. From then on, the film was a television mainstay that captured many new fans. There is a reference to the real-world revival and massive success of King Kong in the 1950s in the 1959 movie A Summer Place. In the movie, two teenagers, Molly and Johnny, tell their parents that they are going to a classic movie showing of King Kong, when they are actually going to an abandoned lookout. Molly calls King Kong \\"one of those wonderful old horror numbers.\\" Johnny frets that if he doesn't watch the movie, he might not be able to answer his parent's questions, but Molly tells him, \\"It's kind of sad dreams If anybody asks, just tell 'em about the end. That's the part everybody remembers.\\". In 1974's Herbie Rides Again Alonzo Hawk has been having nightmares about Herbie. During his nightmare sequence there is a King Kong-themed dream. Alonzo dreams he's Kong with Herbie-like planes flying around him and squirting oil until he falls off the Empire State Building. In a Superman story, an ape grew to giant size and gained kryptonite vision due to meteors of kryptonite and uranium, and was called Titano the Super-Ape. This ape had a liking to Lois Lane, and in one story climbed up the Daily Planet building. King Kong reached the height of its public visibility in the twentieth century in the 1960s and 1970s, as part of a nostalgic trend to 1930s Hollywood. King Kong was becoming a cult film with nostalgia value. During this period the character and story of King Kong was most frequently used as a parody in popular culture. The frequency of its use as a parody at this time shows how significant it had become in popular culture. In the 1968 film Yellow Submarine, the characters look in a room where a monster ape smashes through a window to get at a screaming woman on a bed. \\"Do you think we're interrupting something?\\" George nonchalantly comments of it, to which John replies, \\"I think so.\\" In the mid-1960s RKO began to license a series of King Kong-related products in response to a heavy demand from the public. These products included comic books, games, models, and posters. In 1969 most of the censored shots were found. In 1971 a version of King Kong with these long-missing portions returned to their proper places was released to art houses. References to King Kong in popular culture have been widespread since the 1960s. The references have different tones, with some being parodies while others are parodies or oppositional critiques. Some of these references are fleeting (for example, Frank Zappa named one of his more complex compositions with the Mothers of Invention after Kong), but nevertheless are evidence of King Kong's importance in popular culture. King Kong has been cited in films such as Morgan! (1966), The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975), and Amazon Women on the Moon (1987). In The Rocky Horror Picture Show, the song \\"Science Fiction/Double Feature\\" pays homage to King Kong with the lyric: \\"Then something went wrong for Fay Wray and King Kong ... they got caught in a celluloid jam.\\" At the end of the film, Rocky carries Dr. Frankenfurter on the RKO logo, replicating what King Kong carrying Fay Wray in the climax of King Kong. In 1965 Monocle, a political satire magazine, cohosted a publisher's party at the Empire State Building with Bantam Books, who were reissuing Delos W. Lovelace's novelization of King Kong. A panel of Monocle satirists was due to give an ironic commentary on King Kong, followed by a screening of the film. One of the titles on the satirists‚Äô program was \\"King Kong to Viet Cong: Thirty Years of Gorilla Warfare\\". Andy Warhol, who was not on the guest list, used the occasion to generate publicity and create a performance by complaining to the press that King Kong should be screened with his own film Empire (1964). Warhol was permitted to show three minutes of Empire after King Kong. Empire was then criticized in the press for being too dull and being upstaged by King Kong. By the 1970s the character of King Kong was constantly referenced in cartoons and jokes. In a 1972 New Yorker cartoon, a man at a cocktail party atop the newly constructed World Trade Center comments that he is impressed that it was \\"finished so quickly and without incident,\\" while King Kong climbs up the building below him. It was at this time that the film began to be studied by academics and film theoreticians, who found hidden subtexts and symbolic meanings in the film. However, Merian C. Cooper maintained that the film was nothing more than a simple adventure story. Thomas Pynchon, in his post-modern 1973 novel, Gravity's Rainbow, treats the King Kong/Ann Darrow relationship as an obvious metaphor for Americans' historical racist paranoia of black men dating white women. He quotes the fictional film reviewer, Mitchel Prettyplace, from his \\"definitive 18-volume study of King Kong\\", which includes \\"even interviews with King Kong Kultists, who to be eligible for the group must have seen the movie at least 100 times and be prepared to pass an 8-hour entrance exam.\\" King Kong influenced the 1974 Doctor Who story \\"Robot\\", where the Doctor and his friends in UNIT must stop Experimental Prototype Robot K-1 aiding the evil Scientific Reform Society in conquering the world. In homage to King Kong, K-1 falls for the Doctor's friend Sarah Jane Smith, and views her as the one human being it is willing to spare from destruction. When the Doctor is forced to destroy K-1 with a metal-eating virus, Sarah is visibly saddened. After the highly promoted but vastly inferior 1976 remake of King Kong, Elliot Stein wrote a nostalgic fan homage essay to King Kong called \\"My Life with Kong\\" in Rolling Stone magazine. Stein was one of the most famous of the \\"Kongophiles\\" along with Forrest J. Ackerman and Jean Boullet. In the essay Stein talks about the contexts in which he has seen King Kong during his life, including in the 1930s in New York picture palaces like Radio City Music Hall, and the RKO Roxy and in Paris with Jean Boullet in the 1950s. There was an art deco retrospective of King Kong at the Radio City Music Hall in the 1974 and a King Kong homage was staged for the Telluride Film Festival in the 1970s. King Kong was also mentioned by name by Kermit the Frog in lyrics from the song \\"I Hope that Something Better Comes Along\\" from The Muppet Movie: \\"She made a monkey out of old King Kong/I hope that something better comes along.\\" Additionally, King Kong is one of the epithets Redd Foxx's character, Fred G. Sanford, from Sanford and Son used referring to his sister-in-law Esther. The corpse of King Kong, said to be a leftover prop, appears in the 1978 film Bye Bye Monkey, where a small chimpanzee is found inside of it. ==1980s to the present == King Kong was the first film to feature a giant monster running amok in civilization (the silent The Lost World was actually the first‚Äîalthough it featured a rampaging Brontosaurus rather than a non-science-based monster‚Äîbut was rarely seen after its first release until the video and cable-TV booms of the 1980s); there are echoes of the original King Kong film in every giant-monster film that has been made since 1933. These include The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms (1953), Godzilla (1954) and Jurassic Park (1993). The dinosaur scenes from King Kong are referenced or mimicked in the three Jurassic Park films, especially the second film, The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997). In the third act of the film, a creature (a Tyrannosaurus rex) is brought to civilization from a remote island where it runs amok in a city (the ship that transports the beast is even called The Venture, which is the name of the ship in King Kong). Kong is even mentioned directly in the first one: as the tour group approaches the massive Jurassic Park gate that is reminiscent of the gate in King Kong, Jeff Goldblum's character asks, \\"What have they got in there, King Kong?\\" In the third film in this series, a Spinosaurus vs. Tyrannosaurus rex fight is similar to the Kong‚Äìrex battle in the original and the second remake.Hirschman, Elizabeth C., 2000, Heroes, Monster & Messiahs, Andrews McMeel Publishing, . Homer Simpson as King Kong. From the \\"King Homer\\" segment of \\"Treehouse of Horror III\\". Courtesy of The Simpsons. One of the most frequently used images of King Kong in popular culture is the scene where King Kong and Ann Darrow are on top of the Empire State Building. This image has been copied or parodied in cartoons, comic books, horror films, and television commercials. A popular television spoof was the segment 'King Homer' from The Simpsons episode \\"Treehouse of Horror III\\", in which the King Kong story was retold featuring Simpsons characters, with Homer as Kong, Marge as Ann Darrow and Mr. Burns as Carl Denham. The spoof follows the plot of the 1933 film closely; however, it ends with Marge marrying King Homer after he collapses in exhaustion, failing to climb beyond the second story of the Springfield State Building. King Kong's family, consisting of smaller apes, appear at the wedding, and Homer has a habit of eating people; at the end he eats Marge's father. King Homer also has a cameo in the music video for \\"Deep, Deep Trouble\\" from The Simpsons Sing the Blues CD, and years later, makes another appearance in the opening couch gag of \\"Jazzy and the Pussycats.\\" Homer grabs Marge from the couch and scales the Empire State Building, all while fending off 1930s-style airplanes. King Homer (or Homer Kong) would reappear battling Bridezilla (a Godzilla version of Marge Simpson) in the episode \\"Wedding for Disaster\\". The character also appeared in video games such as Bart's Nightmare and Treehouse of Horror as well as various merchandise such as toys and T-shirts. The original film was referenced again on The Simpsons in the episode \\"Monty Can't Buy Me Love\\", where Mr. Burns captures the Loch Ness Monster and brings him back to America to entertain an audience; however, instead of the Monster going berserk during its debut, Burns himself is startled by the flash photography and causes the carnage.\\"Monty Can't Buy Me Love\\" episode capsule at The Simpsons Archive. In the My Life as a Teenage Robot episode \\"Hostile Makeover\\", Jenny is turned into a Neanderthal and gorilla-like monster; when the cameras flashed their lights to take pictures of her, she roared. In the second Futurama film, The Beast With a Billion Backs Richard Nixon's head remarks about an alien invasion that King Kong is \\"too old to save us this time\\", and the camera pans to an elderly King Kong holding Ann Darrow's skeleton. King Kong is often used in commercial culture, for example in advertisements for Coca-Cola and Energizer Batteries. A New York insurance company used clips from the film to persuade people of the hazards of city life. A two-part Energizer Battery commercial had the 1933 Kong himself contracted by a rival battery corporation (SuperVolt) to get rid of the Energizer Bunny for them. The commercials were done in black-and-white, and used cleverly edited 1933 Kong sequences (possibly combined with new computer-generated Kong shots). The concluding second-part had Kong cornering the Bunny on the roof of a New York City building, complete with biplanes flying in the sky. His foot in an open window interrupts a couple that resemble Ann Darrow and Jack Driscoll having a romantic moment. The woman, extremely annoyed, slams the window on Kong's toes, making him lose his balance and grip, sending him falling.Sweet, Leonard, 2001, Soultsunami: Sink Or Swim in New Millennium Culture, Zondervan, . In 1990 Kongfrontation became one of the original rides at Universal Studios Florida. The film character was the inspiration for the 1981 Nintendo video game Donkey Kong and subsequent spin-offs. In the game, the hero must rescue his girlfriend from the eponymous ape. The marauding ape climbs a huge structure after kidnapping the woman, as in the film. The game's creator Shigeru Miyamoto, intended the name \\"Donkey Kong\\" to mean \\"stubborn gorilla\\". MCA/Universal attempted to sue Nintendo for copyright infringement in Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Nintendo Co., Ltd., claiming that the game infringed its copyright for the film. However, they lost and had to pay Nintendo $1.8 million in damages when it was discovered that King Kong was in fact in the public domain at that time and that MCA/Universal knew this when they filed the lawsuit. They did not own the copyright to King Kong and had not trademarked the name \\"King Kong\\". They had even argued in the past that the name \\"King Kong\\" was in the public domain in Universal City Studios, Inc. v. RKO General Inc., et al.DeMaria, Rusel, and Wilson, Johnny L., 2003, High Score!: The Illustrated History of Electronic Games, McGraw-Hill Professional, .Kline, Stephen, Dyer-Witheford, Nick, and de Peuter, Greig, 2003, Digital Play: The Interaction of Technology, Culture, and Marketing, McGill-Queen's Press, . The music video for Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers' \\"Runnin' Down a Dream\\" references the Empire State Building fight scene against the biplanes, where a giant Tom Petty swats at giant mosquitoes in the same manner as King Kong. The music video to Cherrelle's 1984 single \\"I Didn't Mean to Turn You On\\" features the singer being pursued by a Kong-like gorilla who tracks her to her apartment. In the film The Nutty Professor (1996), Sherman Klump has a nightmare where he is a giant, horrifically obese man. Reggie Warrington (a comedian from earlier in the film) exclaims, \\"Run for the hills, it's Fatzilla! Brother here looks like King Kong with titties!\\" The film was featured in the 1999 film, The Cider House Rules, as the film that the orphans and the children of unwed mothers try to watch before the film cuts out on the projector. In the video game Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, an argument over which building King Kong climbs in the climax blossoms into the beginning of the relationship between the main character Raiden and his girlfriend Rose. King Kong was mentioned in the song of the same name by LA Symphony in 2002 on the album Baloney. Supergator, was based a parody to the character King Kong, It‚Äôs against the stars directed by Brian Clyde, produced by Roger Corman, and starring Brad Johnson and Kelly McGillis. In the 2008 film Be Kind Rewind, Jerry (Jack Black) gets magnetized, thus erasing all the tapes in his friend's video store. They set out to remake the movies, and one of them is King Kong. In The Mr. Men Show episode \\"Skyscrapers\\", he was seen carrying Little Miss Sunshine up a building. In the Total Drama Action (2009‚Äì2010) episode \\"Celebrity Manhunt's Total Drama Action Reunion Special\\", the character Izzy plays a role as Ann Darrow and a monkey plays King Kong portraying a scene on the empire state building. In the 25th Anniversary Super Sentai Series \\"Hyakujuu Sentai GaoRanger\\" (2001), one of the living Power Animal mecha is a large green gorilla called Gao Gorilla, which stands over 100 ft. tall and is regularly seen in the series against the GaoRanger's enemy, the kaiju Orgu. The toy repaint of Gao Gorilla is featured prominently in the GaoRanger theatrical film in the same year, \\"Hyakujuu Sentai GaoRanger- The Movie: Fire Mountain Howls\\", and is called Gao Kong. The primarily-red colored Gao Kong makes his debut from out of the crater of an erupting volcano, and forms the torso & head of the Hyakujuu Gattai Gao Knight giant robot combination. Both Gao Kong and Gao Knight are only seen in the movie, but are not mentioned or seen in the TV series. In Tensou Sentai Goseiger (2010), Kinggon of the Bigfoot, the military leader of the Yuumajuu was named after King Kong. In the anime-manga series Toriko, the protagonist is a gourmet hunter whose job is to travel around the world to hunt the most delicious animals and creatures. One of the first animals Toriko faces is a group of giant four-armed gorillas named Trollkongs that are led by an elder and even larger one named Silverblack Trollkong. The name of these creatures and the idea of a giant ape are based on King Kong's concept. In the Script's song, Hall of Fame, it mentions King Kong (you can be King Kong banging on his chest). In an episode of Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures \\"Jurassic Pac\\" It was shown in a parody where Pac-Man (In the style of King Kong) was seen carrying Cylindria up to a building (Empire State Building). In The Fairly OddParents from the episode 'The Good Old Days', that King Kong was arrested by Carl Denham and others and in another episode, King Kong dealt that banana is for Remy Buxeplenty's get from a scavenger hunt. A special King Kong themed wine was put out by Francis Ford Coppola's winery in 2016. The shows The Penguins of Madagascar, The High Fructose Adventures of Annoying Orange and We Bare Bears each have an episode spoofing Kong's ascent up the Empire State Building: in The Penguins of Madagascar, the episode \\"Otter gone Wild\\" portrays a feral Marlene carrying King Julien up the Cleopatra's Needle sculpture and the penguins (Skipper, Kowalski, Rico and Private) confront her in toy biplanes. In The Annoying Orange, the episode \\"King Coco\\" portrays Coconut swallowing a radioactive space rock which then mutates him into a King Kong-like monster. He then kidnaps Nerville and takes him up a skyscraper resembling the Empire State Building. Orange and the other food-characters also engage him in fighter biplanes until he pukes out the space rock. In We Bare Bears, the episode \\"Adopted\\" portrays a pet gorilla named Carl climbing up his owner's mansion with Panda as a hostage much like how Kong climbed the Empire State Building with Ann Darrow, and Grizz confronts him in a toy monoplane with a water gun. Carl also falls off the mansion, but unlike Kong, Carl survives. == See also == * King Kong ‚Äì 2005 remake of the original film * Peter Jackson's King Kong: The Official Game of the Movie ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Erb, Cynthia Marie, 1998, Tracking King Kong: A Hollywood Icon in World Culture, Wayne State University Press, . * McCutcheon, Camillel, \\"Review of Living Dangerously: The Adventures of Merian C.

He is beheaded for the crime of rape, although this is subsequently revealed to be simply consensual sexual intercourse outside of marriage that the authorities have deemed 'rape'. This being a future civilisation, beheading does not kill Cavala. Instead his 'brain' or, it is hinted, his mind state is placed inside a computer-like device called an 'Ordinator.' He sees and hears via robotic prostheses but cannot smell or taste. After his decapitation he is released into a world that regards the headless as the lowest of the low. A headed volunteer charity worker named Siuzan Delage helps Cavala adjust to his new state. She agrees to accompany him on a trek across a desert to a town more accepting of the headless. Cavala and Delage are joined on this trek by two other headless, Mark Pol and Gymnaste. Gymnaste is a timid soul but Mark Pol is immediately annoying and arrogant from the point of view of Cavala. Arriving at their destination, Delage disappears and the three headless are immediately arrested and questioned, as there is evidence that Delage has been raped. All three vehemently deny this, though Cavala suspects Mark Pol of raping Delage. Through a fight and the obvious hatred of the police inspector, Cavala finds himself enlisted in the army. Before he leaves the police station he is told that it is likely Delage herself will be beheaded as she will not name the perpetrator of her rape and thus will be convicted of 'rape' (this being consensual sex outside of marriage). The army possess devices that trigger extreme pain in the headless through their ordinator and Cavala and his contemporaries soon learn discipline. They are sent to a world named Black Athena and go into combat in the Sugar War. Many months later, returning to Pluse from Black Athena, Cavala finds a menial job and searches for Delage to atone for her beheading. He succeeds in tracking her down (she is indeed headless) and they fall in love. They plan to move to a nearby town with many more headless living there. The night before they are due to move, Cavala runs into Mark Pol, who he has long suspected of raping Delage (Delage is still unforthcoming regarding this event). Cavala threatens to kill Mark Pol, who re-iterates that Cavala cannot trust himself as he is a 'rapist' and it is probably Cavala himself who raped Delage. Cavala leaves Mark Pol, thinking that indeed it might be possible. However, he runs into Delage and she has her head. It transpires that his betrothed headless Delage has been pretending to be the real Delage but has genuinely fallen in love with him anyway. After another run-in with the Police Inspector, Cavala and the headless Delage run away to a remote location and, it is hinted, start planning a headless uprising against the uncaring society that has decapitated them. ==Major themes== The book discusses the types of avenues religious fundamentalism might go down if technology is sufficiently advanced. It also investigates societal prejudice, mistaken identity and misplaced love. Locus magazine described the narrator's style as Proustian. ==Reception== Lisa Tuttle in her review for The Times said that \\"the Land of the Headless is a darkly satirical tale that extrapolates an absurd idea into something weirdly plausible. This is not escapist adventure but a dystopian vision in the tradition of Swift, Orwell and Atwood against the cruelest extremes of human stupidity.\\" ==NotesExternal links== *The Author's Website * Category:2007 British novels Category:British science fiction novels Category:2007 science fiction novels Category:Dystopian novels Category:Works by Adam Roberts (British writer) Category:Novels about writers ","title":"Land of the Headless"},{"id":"12369669","text":"The Leichter Kampfwagen () or \\"LK I\\" was a German light tank prototype of the First World War.

A Thames skiff is a traditional hand built clinker-built wooden craft of a design which has been seen on the River Thames and other waterways in England and other countries for nearly 200 years. Sculling means propelling the boat with a pair of oars (blades) as opposed to rowing which requires both hands on a single oar. ==Skiffs== A pair of double racing skiffs Thames skiffs were developed in the 19th century primarily for leisure use by private individuals sculling themselves. The design was based on the Thames wherries and shallops that were operated by watermen as a water taxi service in London. By the late 19th century, when Jerome K. Jerome wrote of his up-river expedition in Three Men in a Boat,Jerome K. Jerome Three Men in a Boat Penguin Books, . (First published 1889) there were thousands of skiffs at places like Richmond, Kingston and Oxford. However, there are references to skiffs (as a result of accidents) as early as 1812\\"Master John F. Hope, son of John Hope, Esq. of Harley Street, was drowned on Wednesday in the River Thames, near Eaton. He was amusing himself in a skiff near the bridge, with some other Eton Scholars...\\" Salisbury and Winchester Journal 6 June 1812 Wednesday's and Thursday's Posts and 1824 at Oxford.\\"Mar 18 J Harvey esq a commoner of Wadham College. As he was rowing in a skiff between Iffley and Oxford...\\" Gentleman's Magazine March 1824 In August 1815, the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley was taken on a skiffing expedition from Old Windsor to Lechlade by Charles Clairmont and Thomas Love Peacock.James Bieri Percy Bysshe Shelley: A Biography : Youth's Unextinguished Fire, 1792‚Äì1816 University of Delaware Press, 2004 He subsequently settled at Marlow where he regularly skiffed through the locks.Paul Goldsack River Thames: In the Footsteps of the Famous English Heritage/Bradt 2003 Skiffs have fixed rather than sliding seats, and the blades are held in thole pins at the side of the boat rather than outriggers. The blades are made of wood with leather collars and traditional spoons. Pressure is applied by the feet against an adjustable wooden plate known as a \\"stretcher board\\". Skiffs are usually \\"Singles\\" with one sculler, or \\"Doubles\\" with two scullers (one behind the other) and a cox. However skiffs with more scullers or incorporating a sail are also used. Skiffing takes place in the Netherlands and Argentina, using the design of traditional Thames skiff although Argentinian skiffs usually have outriggers instead of tholes. ==Skiffing technique== Collection of skiffing blades The skiff is designed for optimum performance and so the technique applied is important. The two fundamental reference points in the stroke are the catch where the blade is placed in the water, and the 'finish' where the blade is removed from the water. The skiffer leans forward, and bends the legs slightly. After placing the blade vertically in the water at the catch, he or she applies pressure to stretcher, levering the blade in the water on the thole and leans back. This is called the drive phase of the stroke. Once the skiffer has pushed the blade as far forward in the water as possible, he or she extracts the oar from the water, and the recovery phase begins, setting up the skiffer's body for the next stroke. On the recovery, it is normal to tip the blade flat (known as \\"feathering\\"). There are some differences from the rowing stroke. The hands must never pass one above the other ‚Äì one hand must always lead, or one of the blades will \\"dig\\" in the water. The seat does not slide and the unbending of the legs follows from the leaning back of the body. Finally skiffs are more stable so that it is possible to lean back further and keep the blade in the water for longer. The last extra distance provides considerable motive power to the boat, leading to the encouragement to \\"squeeze the finish\\". ==Skiffing for pleasure== Skiffs have the advantage of being able to carry loads and are stable enough to allow occupants to stand up and move about while on the water. Skiffing is therefore an ideal introduction to rowing and river sports. Skiffing provides an opportunity for both short and extended recreational outings on the Thames and other waterways in Britain. The Thames meander is an example of a long-distance skiff journey. For more leisurely progress, a camping skiff has an easily erectable canvas cover and is used for outdoor recreational activity holidays. The Thames Traditional Boat Society is particularly active in supporting recreational use of traditional boats like skiffs. Skiffs regularly take part in traditional boat events, in particular the Great River Race in London. ==Skiff racing== Long distance processional event Final of the Gents Singles Championship Skiff racing provides the challenge of competition and an incentive for physical fitness. A Thames racing skiff is a version of the Thames skiff designed for racing purposes although it is still used recreationally. Racing is in single skiffs or doubles, and unlike in rowing, there are competitions for crews of mixed doubles. Skiff racing in the United Kingdom is governed by the Skiff Racing Association, which was formed in 1901 to ensure that a standard set of rules was applied for racing and boat construction.Skiff Racing Association Handbook The Association is run by a committee elected from the affiliated clubs and regattas, and is affiliated to the British Rowing (formerly ARA). The rules of racing are based on those of British Rowing closely enough that British Rowing qualified umpires may also umpire skiff races. Competitions are held at a number of events on the River Thames between April and October.British Rowing Almanack ‚Äì all years Events are competed at four status levels from Novice to Senior, allowing the opportunity to compete for anyone from complete beginners and Olympic rowing champions. There are two types of skiff race, long-distance and regattas. In long-distance processional events, crews set off at time intervals over a course of two or more miles. At regattas, skiff races are non-processional sprint races held over a distance of up to 800 yards with heats and finals. Regatta races usually have one skiff against another, although three lane racing may also occur. There are a number of Trophy competitions. The Ormiston Trophy is awarded to the Club that wins the highest number of events each season overall, while the Inter-Club competition is a separate event for top scullers in each club. Several Olympic rowers began their careers in skiffs, including James Cracknell, Elise Laverick and Sarah Winckless. Many former British rowing team members continue to compete and exercise in skiffs.

The village owes its origin to Andlau Abbey which was founded in 880 by Richardis, the empress of Charles the Fat.Andlau official website Andlau has been a wine-growing centre and traveler destination since its earliest days. The inhabitants of the commune are known as Andlaviens or AndlaviennesInhabitants of Bas-Rhin The commune has been awarded two flowers by the National Council of Towns and Villages in Bloom in the Competition of cities and villages in Bloom.Andlau in the Competition for Towns and Villages in Bloom ==Geography== Andlau is located some 40 km south by south-west of Strasbourg and 20 km north of Selestat. It is a small town in the Canton of Barr located in the valley of the Andlau river in the foothills of the Vosges Mountains. The surroundings of Andlau town are entirely the Vosges, including a summit, the Stosskopf, which attains a height of 700 metres. The surrounding communes include Mittelbergheim to the north-east, Eichhoffen to the east, Bernardvill√© to the south, Le Hohwald to the north-west and Barr. The commune has an area of 23.69 km¬≤ and its highest point is towards the northern tip of Niederberg and rises to 807 metres. Access to the commune is by the D62 road from Exit 13 on the A35 autoroute which goes west to the town. There is also the D425 from just north of Eichhoffen going west to the village then continuing west to Le Hohwald. West of the town the commune is entirely forested with an extensive network of forest roads. East of the town there is a small area of farmland. ==Watercourses== The Andlau River: a small river which rises in the Vosges Mountains near the Champ du Feu which is a mountain situated at the eastern end of the Ban-de-la-Roche. It flows from west to east through Andlau, Eichhoffen, Saint-Pierre, Stotzheim, Zellwiller, Hindisheim, Lipsheim, and Fegersheim then empties into the Ill downstream of Ill commune. Further upstream the waters of the Valff and the Kirneck used to power 60 mills and other factories until the 19th century. Its course is about 45 km. Toponymy *Andelaha *Andelelaha *Andelo√Øa *Andeloha (999 AD) *Andelow *Andeloa *Andelow *Andelach (1126) Origins of the name Andlau is a distortion of the word Andelaha from Andelaw or Andlaw. Andelaha could come from the original name of the river of which there are traces in old maps drawn in the 15th and 16th centuries. The Andlau River is 42.8 km long and flows from the Champ du Feu to the Ill and is the origin of the name of the town. On 30 July 1857 Andlau was called Andlau-au-Val to distinguish it from that of Andelot in Haute-Marne. At the beginning of the 20th century the name became Andlau. Neighbouring communes and villages ==History== An area occupied since Gallo-Roman times The village undoubtedly already existed in Gallo-Roman times. The village developed around the abbey of nuns founded in 880 AD by Richarde de Souabe, daughter of the Count of Alsace who was known as Erchangar. Sainte RichardeDied in 896 or 897 AD, Richarde de Souabe was buried in the precincts of the church as was the custom later the wife of Emperor Charles the Fat who was grandson of Louis the Pious. The foundation of the abbey The abbey was initially placed in Saint-Sauveur following the rule of Saint Benedict and received the protection of the Pope. It was allowed to raise money until 1004. It was endowed with substantial assets and subsequently received many privileges . The Emperor Charles IV, in confirming it in 1347, declared the abbey free of all charges and contributions and granted to the abbess Adelaide de Geroldseck, and her successors, the title of Princess of the Empire. The exact date of its secularization is not known but it is believed that it took place between the 12th and 14th centuries. In addition to the charter from Emperor Charles IV many other anterior and posterior diplomas were granted to the abbey to confirm the privileges it had already obtained or to give it new ones. The recipients were required to demonstrate sixteen Quarters of nobility without misalliance and the most illustrious families of Alsace and Germany vied for the honour of admitting their girls. They were not subject to a vow and could, when they wished, return to their families and even marry. This abbey received almost from its inception an illustration that greatly contributed to its prosperity and its status. It is known that the Emperor Charles the Fat was too weak to govern the vast empire that had been reunited under him by the death of his two brothers left in the care of the Empress Richarde, his wife. She had to advise Liutward, Bishop of Vercelli. Courtiers, jealous of the authority of the bishop and the confidence that was accorded him by the Empress, long meditated his ruin and found a way to turn the heart of the weak monarch to jealousy which piety, talents, the eminent qualities of his wife, and twenty-five years of constantly happy marriage were powerless to stop. Liutward was expelled from the court and the repudiated Empress retired to the monastery of Andlau. The legend of Saint Richarde was that she suffered the ordeal of fire and, dressed in a shirt coated with wax, was set fire in four places, she was not burned by the flames which were miraculously extinguished. In any case it was in this monastery that the wife of Charles the Fat ended her days in prayer and good works. She also found a source of consolation in letters in which she wrote with great distinction several beautiful poems which have been preserved until now where she writes of her resignation and the purity of her soul. She died before the end of the 9th century and was buried in a side chapel of the Andlau church. A century and a half later she was canonized by Pope Leo IX who was in Alsace, his homeland, and came to bless Andlau's new church built by the Abbess Mathilde, sister of Emperor Henry III. Andlau family The first references to the house of Andlau are in the 12th century which makes this family one of the oldest lines in France. The Andlau line forms 0.5% of the French nobility and their origins date back to the late Middle Ages so are considered old nobility ‚Äì distinguished nobility or ancient nobility. The nobles of Andlau may have given their name to the town. According to some sources, the Andlau family arrived in Alsace in Roman times with another family: the Dandolo of Venice. This family had founded the castle of Bas-d'Andlau. Another version attributes the creation of the town to a man named Balthasard d'Andolo, a native of Bologna. He would have followed Charlemagne who was heading north in the 8th century. It would then be located in the valley of Eleon and could be the origin of the foundation of the noble lineage of the Andlau family who gave their name to Andlau. Balthasard and his son founded a small monastery in the valley near the Andlau river. This theory would therefore go against the version that it was Sainte Richarde who founded the abbey. Another proposal speaks of a knight of Andlau who helped Richarde to find a location where the bear was scratching the ground. The Andlau family acceded to the status of knights from the 9th century. They gave their name to the town and thus made bequests to the abbey. But one can also argue that the family took the name of the town which later gave them their coat-of-arms. The first character, Gunther d'Andalau, was cited in 1141 and became abbot of Saint-Blaise. The lords of Andlau won renown during the Battle of Sempach on 9 July 1386, during which the Earl of Andlau lost four of his sons. It was particularly affected by the Thirty Years' War. The Andlau family are related to many characters in the history of France, such as Claude-Adrien Helvetius, Jacques Necker, Germaine de Sta√´l, Jean Le Marois, Hardouin-Gustave Andlau, and Albert de Mun. The village formed around the abbey Gradually a small town formed around the abbey that the abbess gave in fief in 1364 to the Andlau noble family, one of the most illustrious of Alsace, whose history is mentioned for the first time in 1141 when Ganthier Andlau was abbot of Saint- Blaise. Nine years later Othon, Count of Andlau (Otto de Andelaha) appeared as a witness to a diploma from the Emperor Conrad III in favour of the Abbey of Saint-Blaise. This family has produced many distinguished men which proves the high esteem which it enjoyed under an ancient privilege which was renewed by Charles V in 1550: the eldest son bore the title of hereditary knight of the Holy Roman Empire. Andlau as a pilgrimage town A pilgrimage was dedicated early in its history to the Virgin Mary in the crypt of the church where the canons met every day to pray. The 14th century tower which is often confused Spesbourg Castle - is attested to belong to the nobles of Dicka. Between the 13th and 14th centuries four castles were built in Andlau. One of these was the castle of Wibelsberg-Crax of which there are a few remnants. Built between 1232 and 1249 it was first demolished by Eberhard d'Andlau then rebuilt from 1293. It was called Crax Castle but was finally demolished in 1298 by order of the Bishop of Strasbourg. The lords of Andlau fortified the town in the 15th century. In 1695 the Forest Ranger of Andlau, Frantz Ettighoffen, killed one of the last bears in the Vosges Mountains. In the middle of the 19th century Andlau had more than eighteen mills.

The evolution of the number of inhabitants is known through the population censuses conducted in the commune since 1793. From the 21st century, a census of communes with fewer than 10,000 inhabitants is held every five years, unlike larger towns that have a sample survey every year.At the beginning of the 21st century, the methods of identification have been modified by law No. 2002-276 of 27 February 2002 , the so-called \\"law of local democracy\\" and in particular Title V \\"census operations\\" which allow, after a transitional period running from 2004 to 2008, the annual publication of the legal population of the different French administrative districts. For communes with a population greater than 10,000 inhabitants, a sample survey is conducted annually, the entire territory of these communes is taken into account at the end of the period of five years. The first \\"legal population\\" after 1999 under this new law came into force on 1 January 2009 and was based on the census of 2006. Population of Andlau ==Culture and heritage== The commune has a very large number of buildings and structures that are registered as historical monuments.

Romanesque foundations can still be seen through a ground level gate. This church is still called the cemetery chapel by some villagers. This church also served the people of Eichhoffen who did not have a church until 1865. Between 1777 and 1780 the chapel was built to meet the demand of communicants who regularly attended church. The dead from Eichoffen were buried in the cemetery next to the church. Many ancient graves in the cemetery are therefore not those of the inhabitants of Andlau but Eichhoffen. After several years of entanglements between Andlau and Eichhoffen, the Catholics of Eichhoffen decided to build their own church. The construction of the chapel is the result of several transformations. The steeple of the chapel is octagonal. In the medieval choir there are murals dating from the 15th century. In the cemetery, which is next to the chapel, Commander Marx Cromer (Kremmer) raised, at his cost, the wall that surrounds the chapel between 1495 and 1537. The Saint-Andr√© Chapel owes much to generous donors. In 1896 it was restored thanks to Dr. Stoltz. At the end of the 20th century shoring and drainage works were done to avoid the collapse of the wall that faces the road. During the renovation in 1974-1975 skylights were built in the belfry then removed. For a long time processions stopped in front of the chapel as well as at the shrines that were en route. A number of items in the church are registered as historical monuments: **The main Altar (1700)Ministry of Culture, Palissy **2 Altars, 2 Retables, 2 Paintings (1776)Ministry of Culture, Palissy **A Mural Painting: Annunciation, Ascending to Calvary, Arrest of Christ (14th century)Ministry of Culture, Palissy **2 Altars, 2 banks of altar seating, 2 Retables, 2 Paintings (1776)Ministry of Culture, Palissy **An Altar, altar seating, Tabernacle (18th century)Ministry of Culture, Palissy **A Cross: Christ on the Cross (18th century)Ministry of Culture, Palissy **A Painting: Saint Andr√© (18th century)Ministry of Culture, Palissy **A Pulpit (18th century)Ministry of Culture, Palissy **A Tomb for Charles Rouge (1916)Ministry of Culture, Palissy **Cemetery Cross: Christ on the Cross (2) (1832)Ministry of Culture, Palissy **Cemetery Cross: Christ on the Cross (1) (1832)Ministry of Culture, Palissy Image:Andlau - √©glise Saint-Pierre.jpg The Church of Saint Pierre and Paul Image:Andlau-B.JPG A figure on the north side Image:AndlauPort.JPG The West gate Image:Andlau 052.JPG The Chapel of Saint-Andr√© == Notable people linked to the commune == * Peter Hemmel of Andlau, painter in glass, German, born in Andlau around 1420/1425 * Francois- Thiebaud Rothfuchs, columnist, born 13 April 1645 at Andlau and died in 1690 * Jean-Louis Stoltz, (1777-1869), a military doctor in the time of Napoleon I and renowned ampelographist * Philippe Christophe Hallez, born 30 April 1778 at Haguenau, died 18 November 1842 at Andlau, military man and French politician from the 19th century * Alexis Stoltz, (1803-1896), Gynaecologist with an international reputation. * √âdouard Ignace Andlauer, (1830‚Äì1909), organist, born in Andlau * Alexis Kreyder, (1839-1912), painter * Joseph Sigrist, (1885-1976), former peasant-senator ==Sources== The article was drawn largely from Alsace ancient and modern: topographical, historical, and statistical dictionary of Haut-Rhin and Bas-Rhin, published in 1865.

He played college football at Baylor University. ==Early years== Williams attended Ball High School, where he played at running back. He was also a long jumper, ran on all relay teams, and was a standout hurdler. He won the district high hurdles title as a senior. He accepted a football scholarship from Baylor University, to play under head coach Grant Teaff. He redshirted his freshman year and was a backup running back behind Walter Abercrombie and Alfred Anderson in his first 2 seasons. As a junior, he was a backup behind Ron Francis and Ralph Stockemer. He was a backup behind Derrick McAdoo as a senior, but was able to have his best season making 58 carries for 208 yards, 14 receptions for 183 yards and being used as a wide receiver in some passing situations. He finished his college career with 119 carries for 410 yards, 19 receptions for 210 yards and one touchdown. ==Professional career== Washington Redskins (first stint) Williams was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Washington Redskins after the 1986 NFL Draft on May 3, with the intention of converting him into a wide receiver. He played in just two pre-season games before he was waived on August 4. Dallas Cowboys The Dallas Cowboys were intrigued by his combination of size and speed, and signed him as a free agent prior to the 1987 season. Head coach Tom Landry planned to turn Williams into a defensive back to take advantage of his speed. He was released on September 7. After the players went on a strike on the third week of the season, those contests were canceled (reducing the 16 game season to 15) and the NFL decided that the games would be played with replacement players. Williams was re-signed to be a part of the Cowboys replacement team, that was given the mock name \\"Rhinestone Cowboys\\" by the media. He started at right cornerback and played well enough during those contests that the Cowboys kept him on for the rest of the season. He was mainly as a backup and a special teams player, also seeing time at linebacker on passing situations. He finished with 26 tackles, one pass defensed and one fumble recovery. In 1988, former Baylor teammate Ron Francis entered the season as the starter at right cornerback, before dislocating his left shoulder during an intrasquad game in pre-season. The injury allowed Williams to win the position outright. He recorded 60 tackles, 2 interceptions (tied for the team lead) and 19 passes defensed (second on the team). In the fifteenth game, a 24-17 win against the Washington Redskins, he had 4 passes defensed and set up the winning touchdown with an interception at the Redskins 24 yard line. In the ninth game against the Phoenix Cardinals, he limited Roy Green to one reception for 7 yards and also had 3 passes defensed. In 1989, he missed 3 games with a sprained left knee he suffered in the third game against the Washington Redskins. In the last 2 games he was benched in favor of Francis. He posted 70 tackles, 10 passes defensed (tied for the team lead) and one quarterback pressure. In the season opener against the New Orleans Saints he tied a career-high with 10 tackles. In eighth game against the Phoenix Cardinals he had 4 passes defensed. The next game against the Washington Redskins he had 3 passes defensed. In 1990, he started the first 6 games at right cornerback, before being passed on the depth chart by Manny Hendrix. He played as a nickel back the rest of the season. Here registered 42 tackles, 6 passes defensed, 3 special teams tackles, one interception. In 1991, he was a backup cornerback, starting 2 games at weakside linebacker against the Houston Oilers and Atlanta Falcons, who were employing run and shoot offenses at the time. He tallied 49 tackles, 9 special teams tackles, one interception, 4 passes defensed, one sack and 2 quarterback pressures. In the ninth game against the Phoenix Cardinals he had a block punt to set up a touchdown. In the tenth game against the Houston Oilers he had 10 tackles and returned a blocked punt for his first career touchdown. In 1992, he was moved from cornerback to free safety during the offseason. In the second game against the New York Giants he returned a blocked punt for a 3-yard touchdown. On September 21, he was placed on the injured reserve list because of a left knee injury. He returned on October 28, but was placed on recall waivers and claimed by the Phoenix Cardinals on October 30, where he failed a physical examination and was reacquired by the Cowboys on November 3. He was one of two players declared inactive for Super Bowl XXVII (the other was Alan Veingrad). He appeared in 9 games, collecting 7 tackles and one quarterback pressure. On October 12, 1993, he was released after playing in 4 games. Williams won two Super Bowl rings as a member of the Cowboys. Kansas City Chiefs On December 30, 1993, Williams signed as a free agent with the Kansas City Chiefs. He was cut on March 29, 1994. Washington Redskins (second stint) In August 1994, he signed with the Washington Redskins, but was waived after playing in two pre-season games on August 28. He would later announce his retirement. ==Personal life== Williams is an assistant track coach and football coach at Jesuit College Preparatory School of Dallas. ==ReferencesExternal links== *NFL replacements part of history *Williams a Surprise for Hapless Cowboys *Former Baylor Teammates Fighting for Same Position Category:1962 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Galveston, Texas Category:Players of American football from Texas Category:American football cornerbacks Category:Baylor Bears football players Category:Dallas Cowboys players Category:Phoenix Cardinals players Category:Washington Redskins players Category:Kansas City Chiefs players Category:Super Bowl champions Category:National Football League replacement players ","title":"Robert Williams (cornerback)"},{"id":"12369764","text":"The Limerick Tunnel () is a , twin bore road tunnel underneath the River Shannon on the outskirts of Limerick city.

During his first season at Forest Green, he made 34 league appearances, and two in the FA Cup scoring two goals. During his next season at Forest Green, he played a further 23 games, scoring five goals. At Forest Green, he became famous for scoring one of the worst ever own goals, when his attempted clearance went straight into his own net during an FA Cup match against Morecambe. The own goal became a favourite of former England striker and television presenter Gary Lineker who regularly featured the goal on BBC Match of the Day. However, Hatswell's form in the league was brilliant and earned him a move to Oxford United for ¬£35,000. The move came on 1 December 2000, and at Oxford, he made 52 appearances, failing to score. At the end of the 2002 season, he moved to Chester City on a free transfer. He had a successful spell with Chester, playing 42 times and scoring three times in 17 months, before another move came. This time to Kidderminster Harriers for ¬£8,000. Within weeks of arriving at Aggborough manager Jan Molby made him the club captain, a role that he performed well. Following that award he was rewarded with a three-year contract but then in the year that Kidderminster got relegated he had a very poor season by his standards and was put on the transfer list. When he failed to find a new club during the close season he found he still had a job to do at the Harriers. He eventually left the club in January 2006 in a cost-cutting exercise. He joined Rushden for an un-disclosed fee, believed to be about ¬£10,000. He made his debut for Rushden & Diamonds in an away match against Stockport County. The match ended 2‚Äì2, but both teams needed a win as they were both threatened by relegation. He scored his first goal for Rushden in an away match at Bury, scoring a free kick from 40 yards out. He ended the season a regular at Rushden, but could not prevent their relegation from the Football League. He remained an active member of the first team during the 2006‚Äì07 season, his only goal coming against Stevenage Borough, for whom he scored an own goal during the same match. At the end of the season he was offered a new one-year contract, which he signed. On 18 January 2008, he joined Cambridge United for ¬£20,000. In January 2010, he joined Dundalk as a player-coach. Dundalk manager Ian Foster commented on Hatswell's arrival to Dundalk saying; \\"Wayne is a player who leads by example both on and off the pitch. His leadership qualities are well recognised by the fact that he has been captain at most of his previous clubs. Wayne has operated coaching schools for Arsenal in his home town of Swindon, and has acquired all the necessary coaching badges. I expect Wayne to make a big impact at Dundalk both on the playing pitch and the training ground.\\" Hatswell has been deployed mainly at left-back for Dundalk and his experience has been vital both on and off the pitch. On 2 July 2010, he scored in UEFA Europa League match against CS Grevenmacher of Luxembourg. Dundalk exited the Europa League qualifying at round two to an 8‚Äì0 aggregate defeat at the hands of Levski Sofia. Pride had somewhat been restored however as Dundalk suffered an unlucky 2‚Äì0 defeat in the return leg at Oriel Park on 22 July 2010 having lost 6‚Äì0 in Sofia in the first leg on 15 July 2010. On 26 December 2010 Dundalk announced Hatswell had left the club by mutual consent and on 28 December 2010 Hatswell had joined Newport County in a player-coach role. He was a part of the Newport side that reached the 2012 FA Trophy Final at Wembley but left the club at the end of the season. In the summer of 2012, Hatswell joined Conference North club Brackley Town but left before the turn of the year to try his hand at management. ==Coaching and management== On 3 January 2013, Hatswell was appointed as manager of Stamford of the Northern Premier League Division One South. Stamford won the 2012‚Äì13 playoff final earning promotion to the Northern Premier League Premier Division. Two weeks after winning promotion Hatswell resigned to take up a coaching position at newly promoted League Two club Newport County where he had been a player in the 2011‚Äì12 season.Hatswell appointed first team coach at Newport On 7 February 2015, with Newport County in sixth place in League Two, manager Justin Edinburgh was appointed manager at League One Gillingham.

He was commander in chief of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet from 1917 to 1918. His 1901 textbook Modern Seamanship was a standard reference for over eight decades. ==Early career== Born in Ware, Massachusetts to future American Civil War veteran Charles Sanford Knight and Cordelia Cutter Knight, Austin Melvin Knight was appointed to the U.S. Naval Academy from Florida on June 30, 1869, graduating in 1873. After service as a passed midshipman, he was commissioned ensign on July 16, 1874.US Navy Officers: 1775‚Äì1900 (K) He served in various sea and shore assignments over the next two decades, including tours at the Naval Academy, and in Tuscarora, Constellation, Chicago, Monongahela, and Lancaster. During the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War Knight served as navigator aboard the new monitor Puritan, participating in the blockade of Cuba and the taking of Puerto Rico in 1898. After attending the Naval War College at Newport in 1901, he commanded the armed yacht Yankton off the Cuban coast from 1901 to 1903, and the gunboat Castine in the Atlantic from 1903 to 1904. During the next three years, he presided over a naval ordnance board and a joint Army-Navy board on smokeless powder. Knight was promoted to captain in 1907 and given command of the armored cruiser Washington in the Pacific. He resumed the presidency of the naval ordnance board in 1909. ==Court martial== In November 1910, the monitor Puritan was wrecked by an explosion of four hundred pounds of gelatin during ordnance tests being conducted under Knight's direction. The board of inquiry reported that the monitor had been allowed to sink into the mud despite having remained afloat for twenty-two hours, subsequently requiring the services of a wrecking company to raise. Congress blamed Knight for this perceived lapse and ordered that he be prosecuted for \\"culpable negligence and inefficiency in the performance of duty\\". A court-martial of seven rear admirals convened at the Norfolk Navy Yard, and honorably acquitted Knight. Secretary of the Navy George von Lengerke Meyer disapproved the finding and referred the case back to the court for reconsideration, but the court reaffirmed Knight's acquittal and he was restored to active duty. Knight was placed under arrest while on trial, and his wife fell ill and died during his detainment. The court-martial also threatened to derail his previously scheduled promotion to rear admiral. His private and professional travails coupled with the perception that he had been scapegoated by the political establishment made him a sympathetic figure among his fellow officers. ==Flag rank== Following his acquittal, Knight was promoted to rear admiral in May 1911 (backdated to January 29) and assigned to command the Narragansett Bay Naval Station. He served as commander in chief of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet from 1912 to 1913, interrupted by temporary duty to command a special squadron consisting of the armored cruisers and that was dispatched to the Eastern Mediterranean in November 1912 to protect American citizens in Turkey during the Balkan War. As President of the Naval War College from December 15, 1913 to February 16, 1917, Knight was extensively quoted in Hudson Maxim's influential 1915 book Defenseless America, which exhorted America to rearm.* Knight aligned himself with naval reformers such as Bradley Fiske and William Sims who agitated for a navy general staff headed by a strong chief of naval operations with authority to command both the line and the bureaus. President Woodrow Wilson and Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels strongly opposed the idea, and Wilson instructed Daniels to reprimand Knight after he publicly advocated a general staff in a speech in New York City. ==Commander in Chief, U.S. Asiatic Fleet== On May 22, 1917, Knight raised his flag aboard the armored cruiser Brooklyn as commander in chief of the Asiatic Fleet with the temporary rank of admiral. He directed American naval operations during the Allied intervention at Vladivostok during the Russian Civil War, and was chairman of the ten-nation council tasked with preserving order in the Russian Far East. Knight relinquished command on December 7, 1918 and reverted to his permanent rank of rear admiral. He transferred to the retired list on December 16, 1918. ==Knight Board of Awards== Knight was recalled to active duty from March 13, 1919 until June 30, 1920 to serve as Senior Member of the Board of Awards. No medals had been awarded for naval service during World War I prior to the armistice, so on March 6, 1919, Secretary Daniels appointed Knight to head a board to review all recommendations of commanding officers for the Medal of Honor, Distinguished Service Medal, and Navy Cross, and to submit a uniform list of recommended honors. The board comprised Knight and eight other retired officers, a roster that drew harsh criticism as most of the board members had retired prior to America's entry into the war and none had any personal familiarity with conditions in the war zone. (Knight himself had spent the war in a distant theater.) The Knight Board was in session from March 17, 1919 to October 31, 1919, when it was suddenly dissolved by Secretary Daniels before completing its work and before many of the most important recommendations had been received. Daniels disregarded most of the board's recommendations and drew up his own list of awards. Daniels' list aroused immediate outrage for its perceived caprice; in particular, every commanding officer of a ship that had been sunk by the enemy received the Distinguished Service Medal, while many commanding officers of ships that sank enemy vessels received no medal. Many officers refused the medals awarded them, most prominently Admiral William Sims. Daniels hastily reconvened the Knight Board, but the second session's recommendations fared little better than the first, as the final decision over which medals to award remained the sole prerogative of the Secretary of the Navy. The awards fiasco led directly to the creation of a largely independent Navy Department Board of Decorations and Medals.Navy Cross history ==Legacy== Knight died February 26, 1927, at Washington, D.C., and was buried at the Naval Academy Cemetery. He was President of the Naval Historical Foundation from 1926 until his death.Naval Historical Foundation past leaders On November 17, 1930, he was posthumously advanced to admiral on the retired list with date of rank February 26, 1927, in recognition of his World War I service.Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships: USS Knight Knight was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal for meritorious service as commander in chief of the Asiatic Fleet during Allied naval operations at Vladivostok, Siberia. He was awarded the Grand Cordon of the Rising Sun by the government of Japan.WW I Induction Card: Austin Melvin Knight In 1901, Knight wrote Modern Seamanship, a guide to shiphandling and safety which became famous as the sailor's bible for pleasure boaters and professional seamen alike. The textbook was repeatedly updated for over eighty years, publishing its eighteenth edition in 1988.

On 19 July 1940, the 2nd (African) Division was formed in Kenya, British East Africa. On 24 November of that year, the division was redesignated as the British Army's 12th (African) Division. The 12th (African) Division was also known as the 12th (East African) Division when in October 1941 its West African brigade from the Gold Coast was reassigned and replaced with a third East African brigade. The division was disbanded in East Africa on 18 April 1943. ==Background== In 1938, the King's African Rifles (KAR) in Kenya had been composed of two brigade-strength units organized as a Northern Brigade and a Southern Brigade. The combined strength of both units amounted to 94 officers, 60 non-commissioned officers, and 2,821 African other ranks. After the outbreak of war, these units provided the trained nucleus for the rapid expansion of the KAR. By March 1940, the strength of the KAR had reached 883 officers, 1,374 non-commissioned officers, and 20,026 African other ranks. The size of a KAR battalion was established at 36 officers, 44 non- commissioned officers and other ranks, and 1,050 African other ranks.Andrew Mollo, The Armed Forces of World War II, p. 133 Initially the KAR deployed as the 1st East African Infantry Brigade and the 2nd East African Infantry Brigade. The first brigade was responsible for coastal defense and the second was responsible for the defense of the interior. By the end of July, two additional East African brigades were formed, the 3rd East African Infantry Brigade and the 6th East African Infantry Brigade. Initially a Coastal Division and a Northern Frontier District Division were planned. But, instead, on 19 July, the 1st (African) Division and the 2nd (African) Division were formed. On 24 November, these divisions became the 11th African Division and the 12th African Division. By July 1940, under the terms of a war contingency plan, the Royal West African Frontier Force provided two brigades for service in Kenya. One brigade was from the Gold Coast (Ghana) and one brigade was from Nigeria. The Nigerian brigade, together with two East African brigades (KAR brigades) and some South Africans, formed 11th African Division. The 12th African Division had a similar formation with a Ghanaian brigade taking the place of a Nigerian brigade. By January 1941, the 12th African Division included the following brigades: * 22nd (East African) Brigade * 25th (East African) Brigade * 24th (Gold Coast) Brigade ==Combat history== The 12th African Division was one of the three divisions under Lieutenant-General Alan Cunningham in Kenya. During the East African Campaign, the 12th African Division attacked from Kenya into Italian Somaliland and then advanced into Ethiopia. ==Commanding officers== * Major-General Alfred Reade Godwin-Austen 1940‚Äì1941 * Major-General Charles Christopher Fowkes 1941‚Äì1943 == See also == * East African Campaign (World War II) * 1st (African) Division (United Kingdom) * Order of Battle, East African Campaign (World War II) * Nigel Gray Leakey ==ReferencesExternal links== * British Military History - East Africa 1940 - 47 02 02 02 02 02 Category:Military units and formations established in 1940 Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1941 ","title":"2nd (African) Division"},{"id":"12369895","text":"Sleeman is an unincorporated community located in Rainy River District in Northwestern Ontario, Canada.

He wrote a seven-volume commentary on the Talmud, called \\"Leflagos Reuven\\". ◊î◊®◊ë ◊ë◊†◊í◊ô◊° ◊ë◊ó◊™◊ô◊û◊î ◊ú◊ú◊û◊ï◊ì ◊û◊©◊†◊î ◊ô◊ï◊û◊ô◊™ ◊ë◊õ◊™◊ë ◊ô◊ì◊ï ==Youth== He was the son of Rabbi Zvi Hirsch Bengis, in the introduction to Laflagos Reuvain the Rabbi of the Russian Empire (now Lithuanian) town of ≈†nipi≈°kƒós (now a neighborhood of Vilna), and his wife Shayna, the granddaughter of Rabbi Aaron Brody, dayan of Vilna. Rabbi Zelig Reuven was soon known as \\"the Shnipishoker illui\\" (prodigy). When he was 17 years old, he went to learn in the Volozhin yeshiva under the Netziv, who called him \\"the living Shas\\". While learning at Valozhyn, his reputation quickly grew, and he was known as an extremely sharp student and a diligent learner. After having learned in Volozhin for several years, he married the daughter of Rabbi Chaim Tzvi Broide, Rav of the towns Nemak≈°ƒçiai (Nemoksht in Yiddish), ≈†vƒók≈°na (Shvkshna in Yiddish), and ≈Ωagarƒó (Zhager in Yiddish). After his marriage, he spent eight years living with his in-laws, learning all day. In 1892, he was appointed Rabbi of Boƒáki (Bodki), Poland, succeeding Rabbi Malkiel Tzvi Tenenbaum, who took the position of Rabbi of Lomza. While he was the Rabbi of Boƒáki, in the year 1906, he began to publish his Leflagos Reuvain volumes. These publications took a very unique form, and were far from the standard type of commentary on the Talmud. Rather they were primarily a series of pilpulistic connections between the beginning and end of each tractate and the beginning and end of each of the orders in which the tractates are found. The body of the books were brilliant and unique novellae and expositions of the positions of the Rishonim and their views. The particular genre in which Rabbi Bengis chose to couch his novellae was one that very few Talmudic students could explore, much less master, and that essentially caused his entire literary ouevre to fall into obscurity. In later years, Mossad haRav Cook took it upon themselves to reorganize and publish three volumes of his thoughts. ==Rav in Lithuania== After having spent 19 years as Rav of Boƒáki (Bodki), in 1911, he became the Rav of Kalvarija, Lithuania. During his time as Rav of Kalvarija, World War I broke out. During the war, the Russian government forced Jews to move further eastward. Rabbi Bengis settled in Smolensk, a Russian town where many non-religious Jews lived. In Smolensk, Rabbi Bengis involved himself in teaching these non- religious Jews about Judaism. In this, he received strong encouragement from the Chofetz Chaim. After the war, Bengis returned to Kalvarija. His reputation grew, and he was known as an expert in all areas of Judaism - he knew countless Jewish works, including the entire Tanakh, both the Yerushalmi and Bavli, the Rambam, Shulchan Aruch, backward and forward. He received halachic questions from all over the world. Some of his halachic rulings were published in the periodical HaTevunah, but they were never published in bookform. ==Rav in the Holy Land== In 1932, after the death of Rabbi Yosef Chaim Sonnenfeld, Bengis was asked to become rosh av beit din (Ravad) - 2nd Chief Rabbi - of the Edah HaChareidis in Jerusalem. At that point, however, he declined the offer, since his rival there would be Rabbi Avraham Yitzchak Kook - a fellow student of the Netziv of Volozhin. However, the leadership of the Edah repeated their offer in 1937. Since Rav Kook had died, Rabbi Bengis accepted the offer, and moved from Lithuania to Palestine \\\\- shortly before World War II broke out. In 1947, he and Rabbi Yosef Tzvi Dushinsky, the Chief Rabbi - Gaavad - of the Edah, appeared before a United Nations commission which was to decide the future of the British Mandate of Palestine. They spoke against the establishment of a Jewish state there, requesting the UN to recognize Jerusalem as a holy city which should not be part of any state, but should be ruled by the UN itself as an international city. He also requested the commission to allow the immigration of homeless Jews who had survived the war in Europe. When Rabbi Dushinsky died in 1948, Bengis succeeded him as govad of the Edah. Simultaneously, he also fulfilled the position of Rosh Yeshiva at Yeshivas Ohel Moshe, also in Jerusalem. Bengis died on the 7th of Sivan, 5713 (21 May 1953). He was almost 90 years old, and had fulfilled rabbinical roles in Lithuania and Jerusalem for over 60 years. He was interred on Har HaMenuchot. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Rav Zelig Reuven Bengis ZT\\"L (biography) * Leflagos Reuven / ◊ú◊§◊ú◊í◊ï◊™ ◊®◊ê◊ï◊ë◊ü online at Hebrewbooks.org Category:1864 births Category:1953 deaths Category:Clergy from Vilnius Category:People from Vilna Governorate Category:Lithuanian Orthodox rabbis Category:Haredi rabbis in Israel Category:Rabbis of the Edah HaChareidis Category:Chief rabbis of cities in Israel Category:Rabbis in Mandatory Palestine Category:Burials at Har HaMenuchot Category:Anti-Zionist rabbis ","title":"Zelig Reuven Bengis"},{"id":"12369926","text":"Charles Drake may refer to: * Charles Drake (actor) (1917‚Äì1994), American actor * Charles D.

Responding to the exhibition 'Salute to Berenice Sydney' held at the Royal Academy Max Wykes-Joyce wrote: > In the Spring of 1968 I was much charmed by a first one-person show at the > Drian Galleries of large, lively paintings which evidenced the artist's > interest in dance and music, and a group of black and white drawings on > mythological made in her late teens and very early twenties by the young > self-taught Berenice Sydney.

Painting Sydney's work developed from representational to semi-abstract, and she soon established her style in purest abstract form starting with tiny delicate Persian Garden designs, miniatures in naturalistic colours that become abstract etchings: Bakhtiari, The Sultan's Garden, Shirvan Kabistan II, Hachly Moons, Little Squares, Saruk, which were exhibited in 1969. From 1973 her oils on canvas also began to develop into conceptual abstractions. From discernible figures worked in flowing brush strokes her forms became multi- faceted describing movement in hundreds of colour mutations and shapes. Sydney's later paintings were developed in series, based on specific organic forms, such as leaves (see illustration), that provided a dynamic structural frame for the buildup of paint across large canvasses. Colour combined with vortex-like compositions, starting from a central point to expand outwards, enabled the artist to explore the kinesthetic qualities of visual experience in a way that relates to Bridget Riley's later work. Printmaking Sydney continued to experiment in oils and other media and produced etching, engravings in steel (Art in Steel exhibition 1972), copper and perspex monoprints. One of her influences was Stanley William Hayter and her etchings would then use multiple colours on a single plate. She also produced aquatints and lithographs using one plate for each colour process. Her work in serigraphy was also extensive and first exhibited in 1974. Drawing Sydney's drawing consistently used acrylic and oil pastels, ink and brush creating a series of works on Gemini paper. She produced a series of intensely detailed pen drawings merging the calligraphic with the figurative in a humorous way, as in Pen drawing with Jester, 1976.Florian Rodari Homage to Berenice Sydney, Edwin Engelberts, Galerie Art Contemporain, Geneva 1985 Children's Books Sydney wrote and illustrated a Book of Nonsense Verse 1982/3 later titled Book of Fools which she dedicated to the First of April. A page from this work featuring the poem The Ant who Danced and Pranced is featured in the catalogue to the exhibition Homage to Berenice Sydney. In it the art historian, Florian Rodari's appraisal of Sydney's work appears in French with a translation in English by Charlotte Frieze. The black and white illustrations to the Book of Fools are aquatints etched in a delicately delineated style. The text is written in French and English. Four artist's proofs of the book subsequently titled Book of Fools were printed. The French version of A Book of Fools was purchased by the Biblioth√®que Nationale Paris in October 1982 in addition to a number of the artist's earliest etchings, now kept in the Cabinet des Estampes. An audio cassette recording of the artist giving a reading of the Book of Fools was made at the Mus√©e d'Elys√©e in Lausanne as the artist performed with castanets, accompanied by Gypsy Flamenco musicians and rendered in parts with a Yorkshire accent in homage to her father's family origins. ==Exhibitions== Exhibitions during her lifetime 1968‚Äì1982 1968 *Drian Galleries, First One Person Show, London *Leicester Galleries, - Group Show, London *Edinburgh Festival Costume Designs for Workshops Production of Clown - Televised, Grampian Productions *Magdelene Street Gallery.

The album was released on 10 June 2007 in Egypt, on 15 June 2007 in Middle East, and 3 July 2007 worldwide. On the first day of its release, the album's tracks were available to buy from iTunes. The album features what Angham describes as \\"an image of who she actually is, without retouch or fakeness, exposing to her audience her raw personality.\\" The album has been both a critical and commercial success, after a commercially failed previous album despite its creativity, and has so far sold in excess between 850 000 and 980 000 copies in the Middle East. Some sources revealed that Rotana, Mazzika and Dream channels confirmed that the record of Kolma Nearrab is 800 000 CD, placing the record in a second position among the best-selling records released in 2007 in Middle East. Moreover, elBayan newspaper stipulated that the record sold half a million CD since 18 August 2007 and the number of sales is still escalating. Broadcast intensively one week prior to the album's release in the market, its first single \\"Kolma N'arrab\\" was filmed as a music video by director Ahmad elMahdy in Egypt and was ranked, upon its arrival to Rotana's Top 20 chart, at rank eleven before it moved to rank one after seven consecutive weeks. Rotana's spokesperson, Tony Semaan, assured the record has now a platinum certification. ==Album information== The Album was recorded at Angham's private studio in alShourouk (Egypt) near her house to prevent any leakage of songs and news to the media and press.http://www.egypty.com/top4/angham_pregnancy_studio.asp Angham changed the style of music she adopted in her previous records by picking up a vivid style of music, influenced heavily by reggaeton beats and jazz. She described this record as her first step to introduce her songs to the young demographic which she has failed from to reach for the most part. Contrary to her preceding records, \\"Omry Maak\\" (My Life with you) in 2003 and \\"Bahibbik Wahashteeny\\" (I Love you and Miss you) in 2005, her husband, music arranger Fahd, limited his contributions to the arrangements of the tracks. He worked on four songs only, after heavy criticism of her ability to release a record without his help. The record's tracks were recorded by M. Nash'at Naser elDeen and Mohammad Saker while the mixing was done by Khaled Ra'ouf and Amro Hashem. M. Mahmoud Ezzat and Khaled Raouf supervised the recording of Angham's voice. Mohammad Sakker worked on the digital mastering of the entire record. Angham's surprise in this record is her remake of the famous pop folk song \\"Ashky Lmeen\\" (Whom Shall I Complain To) of veteran artist, Mohammad Mounir. She explained this step as wanting to pay tribute to Mounir's musical accomplishments since his career's debut till now. The CD cover, showing an inspired Angham looking to the sky, was photographed by Karine and Charbel in collaboration with Karim Noor. The vintage design of cover's layout was done by Khaled Rushdy in her second collaboration with him, (the first the being \\"Wahadaniya\\" (Lonely) in 1999). Angham's current production company and distributor, Rotana, released the record three weeks earlier than its original release date. This was a decision made so that the album wouldn't be in competition with Lebanese singer Najwa Karam's new album Hayda Haki (That's What I'm Talking About). Angham dedicated this record mostly to her fans, and to the young music composers who presented her in a new and rejuvenated form. ==Promotion== The failure of Angham's previous record, Bahibbik Wahashteeny (I Love You, I Miss You) (2005), had been partly attributed to inadequate promotional tours and the quasi-absent of many important public appearance. During 2005, Angham has been pregnant. She added on Maa Hobbi (With Love) talk show (Rotana Channel) that \\"I could have chosen the choice of not releasing the 2005 record and content instead with spending quality time with my family. But, I chose not to do that.\\" \\"Kolma N'arrab\\" has been Angham's best-received album in years. Critics tend to agree that her 2005 record was generally uninspired, and have hailed \\"Kolma N'arrab\\" as a return to form. Whereas the campaign for her previous studio album concentrated on her maternal stress and alleged marital divorce, the marketing for \\"Kolma N'arrab\\" attempted to arouse curiosity about the rumor of Angham being accused of filming \\"Kolma N'arrab\\" in alSahadar mosque in the ancient section of Cairo in Egypt. The rumor, spread around the Middle East countries, caused a riot in the Parliament of Egypt, and a possible ban for Angham to enter Kuwait. However, the rumor's folder ended firmly only few days before the broadcasting of the music video on Rotana channel when Angham appeared on \\"elYom elSabee\\" (On The Seventh Day) talk show to publicly denounce the rumor with factual documentation of what happened exactly during the filming days. For the first time, Angham started to pre-promote for her record before its release. She sang \\"Atmannalo elKheir\\" (I Wish Him All The Best) unplugged on Cairo Todayhttp://www.listenarabic.com/ar/%D8%AE%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%A7%D8%A7%D8%A7%D9%85-%D8%A7%D8%AD%D8%AA%D9%81%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%87%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%88%D9%85-%D8%A8%D9%85%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B1-7.php show hosted by Omar Adeeb and on Hala Febrayer concert 2007. She also sang exclusively a short part of \\"Mabahebbesh\\" track on \\"Khaleek belBeit\\" (Stay Home) talk show on Future channel and \\"elYom elSabee\\" (On The Seventh Day) hosted by Mahmoud Saad. Angham's \\"Kolma N'arrab\\" concert tour around the Middle East officially started on 14 July 2007. She kicked off the tour at \\"Layali elTelevision\\" (Television Nights) concert which took part in the Chinese Garden in Cairo. It was performed and broadcast Live on both Egyptian Channel 1 and Egyptian Satellite channel at the same time. Critics confirmed that the concert was successful, and noticed a new way of thinking from Angham, as she was aiming at gathering the young demographic into her fans' record. Despite the small space, 3600 spectators came to the concert, most of them aged between seventeen and twenty-six years old. Angham then performed at Studio 2M, an international show at Casablanca in Morocco, which is loyally watched in France. She sang \\"Kolma N'arrab\\", \\"Atmannalo elKheir\\" (I'll Wish Him All The Luck) and her hit \\"Sidi Wisalak\\" (Your Charm). She also performed at \\"Nejm elNoujoum\\" (Star of Stars) musical talent search show in Kuweit, where she left the press perplexed and curious about the reason why she cried during her performance of \\"Inta Meen\\" (Who Are You) from her 2005 record. Angham also was the guest of Maa Hobby's closure of the first season, a gift from Rotana to show an admiration to the effort Angham did in making her latest record successful and popular. On 22 August, Angham performed a private and grand concert at Semiramis, a five-stars hotel in Cairo. This is the first time in her singing career that Angham takes on a step like this. ==Music video== So far, the album spawned only one single released one week before the album release. \\"Kolma N'arrab\\" was released on 5 June 2007, to critical acclaim and a successful run on the majority of Arabic charts. It was broadcast in Canada and United States of America on 14 July 2007. The music video for \\"Kolma N'arrab\\" was artfully directed by veteran director Ahmed El Mahdi. The storyline revolves around a single woman, portrayed by Angham, living in an urban setting. She is in love with a man, whom she saw as she is entering her apartment building, at first sight. She finally takes the plunge at a party and dances with him, bringing the lyrics \\"closer\\" to life. According to Angham's official website , Angham will shoot \\"Dah Elly Indi\\" (That's All I Got in Store For You) or \\"Ma Bataallemsh\\" (I'll Never Learn) next and release the chosen song as the second single of the album. According to Aaram newspaper, it is confirmed she will film her second single under the direction of Ahmad elMahdy.http://www.aaramnews.com/website/11201NewsArticle.html Angham settled down for the shooting of \\"Ma Bataallemsh\\" as her second music video, according to Elaph E-newspaper. ==Track listing== # \\"Kolma N'arrab\\" (Whenever We Come Closer) [4:54 min] (Lyrics by: Baha' elDeen Mohammad  Music composed by: Khaled Ezz  Music arrangements by: Fahd) # \\"Ma Bataallemsh\\" (I'll Never Learn) [5:00 min] (Lyrics by: Amir T'eaima  Music composed by: Khaled Ezz  Music arrangements by: Tarek Madkour) # \\"Atmannalo elKheir\\" (I'll Wish Him All The Luck) [4:44 min] (Lyrics by: Amir T'eaima  Music composed by: Khaled Ezz  Music arrangements by: Walid Kayem) # \\"elAmal\\" (The Hope) [3:54 min] (Lyrics by: Mustafa Mursi  Music composed by: Khaled Ezz  Music arrangements by: Ashraf Mahrous) # \\"Bagheer\\" (I Get Jealous) [4:26 min] (Lyrics by: Nader Abdullah  Music composed by: Tamer Ali  Music arrangements by: Tameem) # \\"Dah Elly Indi\\" (That's All I Got In Store For You) [3:44 min] (Lyrics by: Amir T'eaima  Music composed by: Ramy Gamal  Music arrangements by: Fahd) # \\"Ma Bahebbesh\\" (I Don't Like) [4:01 min] (Lyrics by: Ayman Bahgat Amar  Music composed by: Khaled Ezz  Music arrangements by: Issam Shrayti) # \\"Ghayarteni\\" (You Changed Me) [4:32 min] (Lyrics by: Hend elKadi  Music composed by: Khaled Ezz  Music arrangements by: Fahd) # \\"Ashky Lmeen?\\" (Whom Shall I Complain To?)

His men became commonly known as \\"White's Comanches\\" for their war cries and sudden raids on enemy targets. ==Early life== Elijah White was born in the area of Poolesville, Maryland. In 1855, White moved to Missouri to fight in the border wars with Kansas. The following year, he returned home and bought the Ball farm across the Potomac River in Loudoun County, Virginia, in the vicinity of the Big Spring north of Leesburg. ==Civil War== At the outbreak of the Civil War, White enlisted in Captain Daniel T. Shreve's Loudoun Cavalry, where he quickly rose to the rank of corporal. His service with the unit was short, and in June 1861 he joined Company C in Lt. Col. Turner Ashby's 7th Virginia Cavalry. While home on furlough, White served as an aide and scout for Col. Eppa Hunton's 8th Virginia Infantry during the Battle of Ball's Bluff, which took place near his farm. For his invaluable service in the fight, White was given a captain's commission and granted permission to raise a company of men from Loudoun County for border service in the Provisional Army of the Confederacy. The 35th In December 1861, White established recruiting offices for his command in Leesburg, and by January 11 he had raised enough men to have an active unit in the army. He was ordered to scout around Waterford. Two months later on March 19, the Comanches had enough members to be formally organized as the 35th Battalion of Virginia Cavalry. Although raised for border service and highly involved in the partisan fighting in Loudoun County, Elijah White and the 35th were quickly mustered into regular service and fought in several major campaigns and battles, including Jackson's Valley Campaign and the Battle of Brandy Station. The 35th Battalion was one of the first Confederate units to arrive in Gettysburg, chasing off Pennsylvania militia on June 26, 1863, during an expedition to the Susquehanna River. For the final months of the war, Elijah White and the 35th were a part of the celebrated \\"Laurel Brigade.\\" Following the Battle of High Bridge on April 6, 1865, in which General James Dearing was fatally wounded, White was placed in command of that brigade. Four days later, White disbanded the Laurel Brigade and the 35th. Nearly a month later on May 8, White was paroled in Winchester. ==Postbellum life== After the war, White returned to Loudoun County a hero and resumed his farming operations. In 1866 he successfully ran for county sheriff. The four-year term was the only time in public office that White would spend.

He was a disciple of the author of Shevet Sofer, one of the grandchildren of the Chassam Sofer. After his marriage to Sheindel, the daughter of Rabbi Mordechai Winkler, author of Levushei Mordechai, Dushinsky became the Chief Rabbi in Galanta, Slovakia. In an epidemic during World War I, his wife died, leaving no children. He subsequently remarried Esther Neuhaus, daughter of Rabbi Yoel Tzvi Neuhaus. He relocated to the town of Chust to assume the position of Chief Rabbi. In 1921, his only child, Yisroel Moshe, was born. ==Move to Jerusalem== Graves of the First Dushinsky Rebbe, Rabbi Yosef Tzvi Dushinsky (foreground) and his son, the Second Dushinsky Rebbe, Rabbi Yisrael Moshe Dushinsky (background), in the Shaare Zedek Cemetery, Jerusalem. In 1930, the Dushinsky family moved to the British Mandate of Palestine, settling in Jerusalem. Shortly after in 1932 came the death of the Chief Rabbi and founder of the Edah HaChareidis, Rabbi Yosef Chaim Sonnenfeld. Dushinsky was appointed as his successor. He founded a community of Hungarian Jews in Jerusalem, affiliated with the Perushim section of the Edah HaChareidis. This community gradually developed into a Hasidic dynasty, which is today headed by his grandson, who was named after him. Dushinsky was known for his strong opposition to Zionism, and spoke to the newly formed United Nations against the creation of the Zionist State. In fall 1948 Dushinsky was hospitalized in the Shaarei Zedek Hospital on Jaffa Road under the care of Dr. Moshe Wallach, director-general of the hospital. He died on the eve of Sukkot 1948 and was buried in the small cemetery adjacent to the hospital, which was used as a temporary burial ground during the 1948 Arab- Israeli War when the Jewish cemetery on the Mount of Olives was inaccessible. He was succeeded by Rabbi Zelig Reuven Bengis as Chief Rabbi of the Edah HaChareidis, and by his son, Rabbi Yisroel Moshe Dushinsky, as leader of the Dushinsky Hasidim, which would under the latter's leadership turn into one of the newest Hasidic dynasties. ==Publications== His Torah commentaries have been published in the Toras Maharitz series. ==Maalot Harav Dushinsky== The Jerusalem Municipality sought to honor Dushinsky after his death with the naming of a street, but his son refused for fear that any Shabbat desecration that occurred on the street (e.g. the driving of cars on the Shabbat) would cause pain to his father's soul. After many requests, his son agreed to the naming of a passageway of stairs in the Pagi (Sanhedria) neighborhood after his father, since cars could not access this path. ==Rebbes of Dushinsky== #Rabbi Yosef Tzvi Dushinsky (1867‚Äì1948) #Rabbi Yisroel Moshe Dushinsky (1921‚Äì2003), son of Yosef Tzvi Dushinsky #Rabbi Yosef Tzvi Dushinsky, son of Yisroel Moshe Dushinsky ==ReferencesSources== * ==External links== * Chief Rabbi Yosef Tzvi Dushinsky - writings against Zionism Category:1867 births Category:1948 deaths Category:Rebbes of Dushinsky Category:Rabbis of the Edah HaChareidis Category:Haredi rabbis in Israel Category:Anti-Zionist rabbis Category:Slovak Orthodox rabbis Category:Rabbis in Mandatory Palestine ","title":"Yosef Tzvi Dushinsky (first Dushinsky rebbe)"},{"id":"12370056","text":"Ay≈üe ≈ûan (Aysha Shan) (1938, in Diyarbakƒ±r ‚Äì 18 December 1996, in ƒ∞zmir) was a Kurdish singer.

In 2020, his public page was shut down by Facebook after repeatedly violating the social network's policies against hate speech. He was previously made to retract a homophobic statement made on another social network, Twitter. ==Early life and education== Jeremy Talfer Nell was born in 1979 in Cape Town, South Africa. Nell attended Fairmont High School. After graduating, Nell went to study art and sculpture at the University of Cape Town but failed the course and dropped out. ==Career== Nell became a cartoonist in November 2005, after being retrenched. Nell had no completed formal art training. Nell's first commercially published work, and nationally syndicated comic strip, Urban Trash (first published November 2005), ended 27 June 2008. In 2010, Nell became the first political cartoonist for the newly launched The New Age, a pro-government daily newspaper. He was dismissed in 2012. In 2012, Nell became the first political cartoonist for Eyewitness News. That year he cited Zapiro and Quentin Blake as some of his favourite cartoonists. In 2013, Nell became the first political cartoonist for eNCA.com. In February 2014, Nell voiced his support for David Bullard when Bullard donated to a rape charity (who returned his donation) after being criticised for accusing rape survivor and activist Michelle Solomon of having faked her rape. In December 2014, Nell was forced to apologise for making a homophobic remark online. After receiving heavy criticism for a tweet regarding the trial of Shrien Dewani, during which the prosecution heard that Dewani was bisexual, Nell apologised and retracted his statement. In January 2020, after Democratic Alliance chairperson Helen Zille shared a controversial racial cartoon created by Nell, Facebook closed Nell's public page, which had nearly 60,000 followers. Nell said he had previously violated the site's rules against hate speech. According to Mail & Guardian critic Christopher McMichael, Nell's political cartoons portray black politicians as \\"baying for white genocide\\" and reveal crypto-fascist ideas about racial intelligence. ==Publishing and awards== Penguin Books have published two cartoon collections by Nell, Jerm Warfare (2013) and Comedy Club (2014). Additionally some of his work features in (and on the front cover of) the 2009 edition of the South African political cartooning annual Don't Joke: A Year in Cartoons, as well as in the 2010 edition, Just For Kicks. Nell won the national 2011 Vodacom Journalist of the Year Cartoon of the Year award for his cartoon Africa 2.0. The Mail & Guardian named Nell as one of their \\"Top 200 Young South Africans\\" in 2012. Nell was a finalist at the 2014 Standard Bank Sikuvile Journalism Awards. ==Personal life== Nell claimed in his blog that he married in May 2019 and honeymooned in Europe.https://jermdraws.com/blog/france-is-too-socialist-for-me ==ReferencesExternal links== * official website Category:1979 births Category:Living people Category:Artists from Cape Town Category:Comic strip cartoonists Category:South African editorial cartoonists Category:South African satirists Category:South African bloggers ","title":"Jeremy Nell"},{"id":"12370087","text":"The Archiud is a left tributary of the river Dip»ôa in Romania.

Note the labelling in Spanish, and the grain's distinctive orange-pink colour. Images like this were suppressed in state media. The 1971 Iraq poison grain disaster was a mass methylmercury poisoning incident that began in late 1971. Grain treated with a methylmercury fungicide and never intended for human consumption was imported into Iraq as seed grain from Mexico and the United States. Due to a number of factors, including foreign-language labelling and late distribution within the growing cycle, this toxic grain was consumed as food by Iraqi residents in rural areas. People suffered from paresthesia (numbness of skin), ataxia (lack of coordination of muscle movements) and vision loss, symptoms similar to those seen when Minamata disease affected Japan. The recorded death toll was 459 people, but figures at least ten times greater have been suggested. The 1971 poisoning was the largest mercury poisoning disaster when it occurred, with cases peaking in January and February 1972 and stopping by the end of March. Reports after the disaster recommended tighter regulation, better labelling and handling of mercury-treated grain, and wider involvement of the World Health Organization in monitoring and preventing poisoning incidents. Investigation confirmed the particular danger posed to fetuses and young children. == Context == The properties of mercury make it an effective fungicide. Methylmercury had been banned in Sweden in 1966, the first country to do so, and the United Kingdom followed in 1971. Previous mercury-poisoning incidents had occurred in Iraq in 1956 and 1960. In 1956, there had been around 200 cases, and 70 deaths; in 1960 there had been 1000 cases and 200 deaths, in both cases due to ethylmercury compounds. Among the recommendations made after the 1960 incident had been to colour any toxic grain for easy identification. Before the 1971 incident, around 200‚Äì300 cases of methylmercury poisoning had been reported worldwide. Drought had reduced harvests in 1969, affecting 500,000 people, and in 1970. Saddam Hussein, as the government's no. 2 behind Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr, decided to import mercury- coated seed grain for the late 1971 planting season. Hussein himself may have worked in the Department of Agriculture in the aftermath of the 1960 incident. == Causes == A map of Iraq (1976) showing the provinces referred to. Some of grain (73,201 tonnes of wheat grain and 22,262 tonnes of barley), coloured a pink-orange hue, were shipped to Iraq from the United States and Mexico. The wheat arrived in Basra on SS Trade Carrier between 16 September and 15 October, barley between 22 October and 24 November 1971. Iraq's government chose Mexipak, a high-yield wheat seed developed in Mexico by Norman Borlaug. The seeds contained an average of 7.9 Œºg/g of mercury, with some samples containing up to nearly twice that. The decision to use mercury-coated grain has been reported as made by the Iraqi government, rather than the supplier, Cargill. The three Northern governorates of Ninawa, Kirkuk and Erbil together received more than half the shipments. Contributing factors to the epidemic included the fact that distribution started late, and much grain arrived after the October‚ÄìNovember planting season. Farmers holding grain ingested it instead, since their own planting had been completed. Distribution was hurried and open, with grain being distributed free of charge or with payment in kind. Some farmers sold their own grain lest this new grain devalue what they had. This left them dependent on tainted grain for the winter. Many Iraqis were either unaware of the significant health risk posed, or chose to ignore the warnings. Initially, farmers were to certify with a thumbprint or signature that they understood the grain was poison, but according to some sources, distributors did not ask for such an indication. Warnings on the sacks were in Spanish and English, not at all understood, or included the black-and-white skull and crossbones design, which meant nothing to Iraqis. The long latent period may have granted farmers a false sense of security, when animals fed the grain appeared to be fine. The red dye washed off the grain; the mercury did not. Hence, washing may have given only the appearance of removing the poison. Mercury was ingested through the consumption of homemade bread, meat and other animal products obtained from livestock given treated barley, vegetation grown from soil contaminated with mercury, game birds that had fed on the grain and fish caught in rivers, canals, and lakes into which treated grain had been dumped by the farmers. Ground seed dust inhalation was a contributing factor in farmers during sowing and grinding. Consumption of ground flour through homemade bread is thought to have been the major cause, since no cases were reported in urban areas, where government flour supplies were commercially regulated. == Symptoms, outbreak and treatment == The effect of mercury took some time ‚Äì the latent period between ingestion and the first symptoms (typically paresthesia ‚Äì numbness in the extremities) was between 16 and 38 days. Paresthesia was the predominant symptom in less serious cases. Worse cases included ataxia (typically loss of balance), blindness or reduced vision, and death resulting from central nervous system failure. Anywhere between 20 and 40 mg of mercury has been suggested as sufficient for paresthesia (between 0.5 and 0.8 mg/kg of body weight). On average, individuals affected consumed 20 kg or so of bread; the 73,000 tonnes provided would have been sufficient for over 3 million cases. The hospital in Kirkuk received large numbers of patients with symptoms that doctors recognised from the 1960 outbreak. The first case of alkylmercury poisoning was admitted to hospital on 21 December. By 26 December, the hospital had issued a specific warning to the government. By January 1972, the government had started to strongly warn the populace about eating the grain, although dispatches did not mention the large numbers already ill. The Iraqi Army soon ordered disposal of the grain and eventually declared the death penalty for anyone found selling it. Farmers dumped their supplies wherever possible, and it soon got into the water supply (particularly the River Tigris), causing further problems. The government issued a news blackout and released little information about the outbreak. The World Health Organization assisted the Iraqi government through the supply of drugs, analytical equipment and expertise. Many new treatments were tried, since existing methods for heavy metal poisoning were not particularly effective. Dimercaprol was administered to several patients, but caused rapid deterioration of their condition. It was ruled out as a treatment for this sort of poisoning following the outbreak. Polythiol resins, penicillamine and dimercaprol sulfonate all helped, but are believed to have been largely insignificant in overall recovery and outcomes. Dialysis was tested on a few patients late in the treatment period, but they showed no clinical improvement. The result of all treatments was varied, with some patients' blood mercury level being dramatically reduced, but a negligible effect in others. All patients received periods of treatment interspersed with lay periods; continuous treatment was suggested in future cases. Later treatment was less effective in reducing blood toxicity. == Effects == Incidence of cases and fatalities, by age group 6,530 patients were admitted to hospitals with poisoning, and 459 deaths reported. Cases reached a peak of hundreds per day in January, and had largely subsided by the beginning of March. The last admittance was on 27 March; admissions represented every age and gender stratum, although those under the age of ten represented a third of admitted cases. This number is \\"certainly an underestimate\\", because of the availability of hospital treatment, hospital overcrowding and lack of faith in treatment. In the most severely affected areas, prevalence was 28% and mortality was 21% of the cases. Some Iraqi doctors believe both the number of cases and fatalities are at least ten times too low, with perhaps 100,000 cases of brain damage. One suggested reason for the vast discrepancy between reported and estimated numbers of deaths is the Iraqi custom, common to large parts of the Middle East, for a person to die at home when possible. Home deaths would not have been recorded. A large number of patients with minor symptoms recovered completely; those with more serious symptoms improved. This was in contrast to expected outcomes, largely based on analysis of Minamata disease in Japan. In boys with mercury levels below clinical poisoning, a reduction in school performance was noted, although this correlation could not be confirmed. In infants, the mercury poisoning caused central nervous system damage. Relatively low doses caused slower development in children, and abnormal reflexes. Different treatments for mercury poisoning have since been developed, and \\"quiet baby syndrome\\", characterised by a baby who never cries, is now a recognised symptom of methylmercury-induced brain damage. Ongoing recommendations of the food regulation authorities have focused on consumption by pregnant women and infant children, noting the particular susceptibility of fetuses and infants to methylmercury poisoning. Data from Iraq have confirmed that methylmercury can pass to a child in utero, and mercury levels were equal to or higher in the newborn child than in the mother. In 1974, a joint Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and World Health Organization (WHO) meeting made several recommendations to prevent a similar outbreak. These included stressing the importance of labelling bags in the local language and with locally understood warning symbols. The possibility of an additive creating a strong bitter taste was studied. The meeting urged governments to strictly regulate methyl- and ethylmercury use in their respective countries, including limiting use to where no other reasonable alternative was available. It also recommended the involvement of the FAO and WHO in assisting national governments in regulation and enforcement, and the setting up of national poison control centres. Over 9‚Äì13 November, a Conference on Intoxication due to Alkylmercury-Treated Seed was held in Baghdad. It supported the recommendations of the FAO/WHO report and further suggested that local and national media should publicise outbreaks, including size and symptoms; it considered the distribution of this information crucial. It also laid out a general plan as to the collection of relevant information from the field and potential analysis for further investigation. It called on national governments to make use of WHO involvement whenever feasible, and absolved world governments in clear terms, saying that \\"No country should ever feel that any blame will attach to it for allowing an outbreak to occur\\". ==See also== * Minamata disease == References == Category:1971 health disasters Category:Mercury (element) Category:Adulteration Category:1971 in Iraq Category:20th century in Iraq Category:Iraq‚ÄìUnited States relations Category:Mass poisoning Category:Food safety scandals Category:Health disasters in Iraq ","title":"1971 Iraq poison grain disaster"},{"id":"12370112","text":"Big Slide Mountain can refer to several mountains: ","title":"Big Slide Mountain"},{"id":"12370120","text":"The Pintic is a right tributary of the river Dip»ôa in Romania.

In 1995, he then moved to McNeese State of the NCAA Division I for his junior and senior years. During his senior year at McNeese State, Ellis averaged 18.5 points per game on almost 67 percent shooting.A Former Rainier Beach Star Was Exiled to the Wacky World of Filipino Basketball ==Professional== After his college career, Ellis joined Deportivo Roca of Argentina for the 1997 season. Later that year, he joined the Des Moines Dragons of the now-defunct International Basketball Association for the 1997‚Äì98 season, becoming the league's fifth-leading scorer. He attracted scouts to his games but had an incident in January 1998. There were NBA scouts in the stands when Ellis lost his mind and put an IBA referee in a choke hold. According to Ellis, a referee, Bob Schoewe, was berating players as they lined up around the paint for free throws. Ellis snapped back at Schoewe, who denies insulting the players, and in turn gave Ellis a technical foul in retaliation. Ellis protested again and the ref called a second technical and ejected him from the game. Ellis ran to the scorer's table where Schoewe was reporting the ejection, leaped on the referee's back, and put Schoewe in a sleeper hold. A throng of coaches, players, referees, and security officers pulled Ellis away from Schoewe and brought him to the locker room. The IBA banned him for a year for this action. This action was after Latrell Sprewell's choking of his coach, thus Ellis was shunned by NBA scouts. Now, Ellis looks at this incident as one of his big misdeeds. On October 2, 2000, he signed with the Detroit Pistons. However, he was waived on October 21.All-Time Transactions Ellis joined the Perth Wildcats for the 2004‚Äì05 season as a late replacement for Jaron Brown, where he played both power forward and small forward.

She was awarded 5 battle stars for service in the Pacific during World War II. She was decommissioned in February 1947 and placed in reserve. Although she did not see service in the war zone, Scout was recommissioned in May 1951 during the Korean War and remained in commission until March 1954, when she was placed in reserve again. While she remained in reserve, Scout was reclassified as MSF-296 in February 1955 but never reactivated. In October 1962, she was sold to the Mexican Navy and renamed ARM DM-09. Although she is reported out of service, her ultimate fate is not reported in secondary sources. == U.S. Navy career == Scout was laid down on 8 February 1943 by Winslow Marine Railway and Shipbuilding Co., Seattle, Washington; launched on 2 May 1943; sponsored by Miss Mary Lou Lillehei; and commissioned on 3 March 1944, Lt. E. G. Anderson, Jr., in command. After shakedown, Scout sailed from San Francisco, California, on 15 May 1944 for Hawaii. Between June and September 1944 she escorted convoys between Pearl Harbor, Eniwetok, Kwajalein, Funafuti, and Tulagi, before reporting to the U.S. 7th Fleet at Manus on 6 October for the Leyte invasion. From 17 to 19 October, she carried out a pre-invasion sweep of Leyte; and, on the 20th, she joined Mine Division 34 in a four-day sweep of the main transport channel. She then anchored with the transports to provide antiaircraft support. Between 27 and 31 October Scout helped search for survivors at the scene of the Battle off Samar, where Rear Admiral Sprague's escort carriers had withstood the attack of a superior Japanese force. For the next month, she carried out local patrols and sweeps in the vicinity of Leyte. Scout participated, with her division, in most of the subsequent landings in the Philippines. She carried out pre-invasion sweeps at Ormoc Bay on 6 December, Mindoro Island on 14 December, Lingayen Gulf on 6 January 1945, and Zambales and Subic Bay between 29 and 31 January. During and after the initial troop landings, she helped extend the mineswept areas and provided antisubmarine and antiaircraft protection to the transports anchored off the beaches. Few mines were encountered, but kamikaze resistance was intense; and, on 7 December Scout rescued survivors of one victim, . On 13 February, Scout and her division began pre-invasion sweeps in Manila Bay in preparation for the landings at Mariveles and Corregidor. While sweeping off Corregidor on the 14th, the minesweepers came within 5,000 yards of the island and were repeatedly straddled by Japanese fire before supporting ships silenced the enemy's guns. Scout continued sweeping in Manila Bay through 19 February, and her division earned a Navy Unit Commendation for the operation. During the next one and one-half months, Scout carried out various local sweeps in support of mop-up operations in the Philippines, the most notable being a pre- assault sweep for the landings at Legaspi, Luzon, on 1 April. This was followed by a three-day exploratory sweep in the San Bernardino Strait, after which the ship returned to Subic Bay for a badly needed overhaul. She rejoined her division on 3 May and on 9 May arrived at Morotai to prepare for operations in the Netherlands East Indies. Between 7 and 18 June Scout supported the landings at Brunei Bay, Borneo; and between 22 June and 8 July, she helped clear the way for the assault at Balikpapan. During both operations the minesweepers came under fire from shore batteries and one ship, , was sunk by a mine on 8 June. Scout's task unit won a Presidential Unit Citation for its service off Borneo between 15 June and 1 July. After repairs at Subic Bay, Scout sailed for home, arriving at Seattle, Washington, on 11 September 1945. She reported to Orange, Texas, on 2 April 1946; was placed in reserve, in commission there on 10 May and placed in reserve, out of commission on 26 February 1947. Scout received 5 battle stars for her World War II service. Due to the need for minecraft during the Korean War, Scout was recommissioned on 11 May 1951, Lt. Comdr. Samuel E. Clark in command. After refresher training at Little Creek, Virginia, 9 July to 6 August 1951, she remained on the Atlantic coast and for two years, operated between her home port of Charleston, South Carolina, the Mine School at Yorktown, Virginia, and local operating areas. Then ordered inactivated, she arrived at Orange, Texas, on 31 October 1953 and was decommissioned on 1 March 1954. While she remained in reserve, Scout was reclassified as MSF-296 in February 1955 but never reactivated.

Poles were allies of Napoleon; a large Polish community settled in France in the 19th century. The French government sympathized with Polish rebels in 1830 and 1863 but did not intervene. Poland and France were allies during the interwar period, 1919-1939. France and Great Britain declared war on Nazi Germany when it invaded Poland in 1939, but were unable to stop the quick conquest. Never in history has a Polish army fought against its French counterpart. Nevertheless, the two countries were on opposite sides during the Cold War 1947-1989. Official relations have been warm since the fall of communism in Poland in 1989. Currently, both countries are part of the European Union, NATO and OECD. Poland is also an observer in the Organisation internationale de la francophonie. ==Comparison== {  - ! ! France !

A notable exception occurred in 1573, when Henry III of France was elected king of Poland, but he retired from that position the next year. The French Order of the Holy Spirit was dedicated to the Holy Spirit for commemorating Henry III's succession as king of Poland (1573) and France (1574) on two Pentecosts. Two Polish kings, W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV Vasa and John II Casimir, were married to French princess Ludwika Maria Gonzaga. After his abdication in 1668, John II Casimir returned to France, where he joined the Jesuits and became abbot of Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s in Paris. His heart was buried there. In the late 17th century, King John III Sobieski married French princess Marie Casimire Louise de la Grange d'Arquien and tried to forge a Polish‚ÄìFrench alliance. Charles-Paris d'Orl√©ans; Fran√ßois Louis, prince of Conti; Henri Jules, prince of Cond√©; and Louis, prince of Cond√© were candidates for the Polish throne. 18th century In the early 18th century, Stanis≈Çaw I Leszczy≈Ñski, king of Poland, who tried to continue Sobieski's efforts and align Poland and France, after losing a civil war in Poland, retired to France. In the mid-18th century, his daughter, Princess Marie Leszczy≈Ñska was the queen consort of France and wife of Louis XV. During the anti-Russian Confederation of Bar the French Court Royal supported the Polish confederates by sending French officers under Charles Fran√ßois Dumouriez. In the late 18th century both Poland and France entered a revolutionary period, with the French Revolution being a major influence on the reforms of the Great Sejm in Poland. There was, however, never any official Polish‚ÄìFrench alliance; in fact France was content to deflect some of its troubles by not allying itself with Poland, as Poland's neighbors, the (Kingdom of Prussia, Austrian Empire, and the Russian Empire), expecting a formation of such an alliance, and seeing Polish reforms as a sign of Jacobinite influence, were busy carrying out the partitions of Poland and had less resources to spare to deal with events in France. Napoleonic era King Stanis≈Çaw I Place Stanislas, Nancy, named after King Stanis≈Çaw I Coat of Arms of Henry III as King of Poland and King of France Napoleon's creation of the Duchy of Warsaw gave every appearance of resurrecting the Polish nation from the political grave to which it had been consigned in the partitions that ended in 1795.John Stanley, \\"French Attitudes toward Poland in the Napoleonic Period.\\" Canadian Slavonic Papers 49.3-4 (2007): 209-227. Russia defeated Napoleon and made the 'independence' no more meaningful than that of Congress Poland, which emerged from the Vienna settlement. However, the Duchy represented the hope of true independence, whereas Congress Poland was always in Russia's shadow. The other lasting significance of Napoleon's Grand Duchy is that it cast off old feudal Poland to some degree under the rule of the partitioning powers. Serfdom was abolished and a modern legal code based on the French model was introduced. Critical was the contribution the Napoleonic period made towards the creation of a national legend or myth, which was to sustain and comfort Poles down the decades that followed. Amongst other things, it contributed to a belief that the rest of Europe had an abiding interest in the fate of Poland, arising from Bonaparte's support in 1797 for the formation of Polish Legions, recruited from amongst √©migr√©s and other exiles living in Italy. The Polish national anthem, \\"DƒÖbrowski's Mazurka\\", is a celebration of the legion's commander, Jan Henryk DƒÖbrowski, and Napoleon is only mentioned in passing. Napoleon's treatment of these soldiers was cynical in the extreme. After the Treaty of Lun√©ville in 1801, they were sent to the West Indies to suppress the slave revolt in the French colony Saint-Domingue, or modern Haiti. Napoleon continued to use Poles where it suited him best. Of the fresh forces raised after the creation of the Grand Duchy of Warsaw, some 10,000 were sent to fight against the Spanish and the British in the Peninsular War. However, the Poles were most enthusiastic about the 1812 war against Russia-which Napoleon called the Second Polish War-as they formed by far the largest foreign contingent of the Grand Army. There is no precise information on what form the peace would have taken if Napoleon had won his war against Alexander, but many Poles held to the belief that it would, at the very least, have led to a fully restored Poland, including Lithuania; a return, in other words, to the situation prior to the first partition in 1772. The whole experience of the Grand Duchy of Warsaw is one of Polish confidence in Napoleon's promise of a better future, though there is really nothing that proves he would have fulfilled these expectations. Polish national determination did impact Czar Alexander I, as he accepted that there could be no return to the position prevailing in 1795, when Poland had been extinguished. On his insistence, lands that had fallen to Prussia on the Third Partition, including the city of Warsaw, became part of his new 'Polish State', a satellite state that had a high degree of political latitude and one that preserved the Napoleonic code. Alexander may have hoped to transfer some of the fierce loyalty the Poles had formerly shown towards his great rival towards himself; but he merely perpetuated a myth. The hope of a liberal Poland, of Napoleon's Poland was kept alive, until it was all but destroyed in the uprising of 1830‚Äì1831. Thereafter, most of those who went into exile sought refuge in France, the home of the Napoleon myth, which gave it fresh life. In 1834, from his Paris exile, Adam Mickiewicz wrote his epic poem, Pan Tadeusz, which celebrates Napoleon's entry into Lithuania in 1812 thus; All sure of victory, cry with tears in eyes/God is with Napoleon, and Napoleon is with us! Although the legend declined over the years, especially as Napoleon III offered no support to the Polish rising of 1863, it did not altogether die. It received fresh encouragement in 1918, as France was the only western power that offered unqualified support to the newly independent Poland. May 5, 1921, the hundredth anniversary of Napoleon's death, was formally marked by commemorations across the new nation. And he lives, and will continue to live, in the national anthem. Great Immigration Jaros≈Çaw DƒÖbrowski caricatured in Le P√®re Duchesne Illustr√©: \\"Un bon bougre!... Nom de Dieu!...\\" (\\"Good chap!... Good God!...\\") The Great Emigration was an immigration of political elites from Poland from 1831-1870, particularly after the November and January uprisings. Since the end of the 18th century, people who carried out their activities outside the country as emigres played a major role in Polish political life. Because of this emigration of political elites, much of the political and ideological activity of the Polish intelligentsia during the 18th and 19th centuries was done outside of the lands of partitioned Poland. Most of those political √©migr√©s were based in France, seen by the Poles - freshly influenced by Napoleon - as the bastion of liberty in Europe.Zubrzycki, 1953 It was during that era that some celebrated Poles came to live in France, such as the composer Fr√©d√©ric Chopin, writers like Adam Mickiewicz, Cyprian Norwid or entrepreneurs like Louis Wolowski and Citroen and much later, the scientist Maria Sk≈Çodowska-Curie (Marie Curie). Interwar period Poland and France were political and military allies during the interwar period. The political agreement signed in Paris on February 19, 1921 established cooperation between them.Text in League of Nations Treaty Series, vol. 18, pp. 12-13.Text of the agreement Starting with the Blue Army that aided France in World War I and the French Military Mission to Poland during the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War (1919‚Äì1921), the Franco-Polish Military Alliance was signed in 1921 and continued until the German invasion of Poland. World War II France declared war on Germany when it invaded Poland in 1939, but was unable to halt the quick contest, Indeed France itself fell to Germany in 1940. After Nazi Germany's invasion and occupation of Poland, a new Polish Army formed in France under the command of General W≈Çadys≈Çaw Sikorski in late 1939. Polish units included the 1st Grenadiers Division, among others. Polish‚ÄìFrench relations ceased 1940-44. Some Poles became part of the French Resistance.Jan Karski,The Great Powers & Poland, 1919-1945: from Versailles to Yalta (UP of America, 1985). Cold War During the Cold War, Polish‚ÄìFrench relations were poor, due to both countries being on the opposite sides of the Cold War. However France was - again - a site of a thriving Polish emigrant community (see Kultura and Jerzy Giedroyc). Other prominent members of the Polish community in France of that period have included Rene Goscinny. Post-1991 President of France Emmanuel Macron (left) and Prime Minister of Poland Mateusz Morawiecki (right) in Brussels Polish‚ÄìFrench relations have improved after the fall of communism. Poland, France and Germany are part of the Weimar Triangle which was created in 1991 to strengthen cooperation between the three countries. France, as a founding member of the European Community, European Union, and NATO, as well as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council and nuclear power, is one of Poland's principal political, economic, cultural, scientific and technological partners. The year 2004 marked a breakthrough in Polish‚ÄìFrench relations. After a period of tension caused by different approaches to the Iraq crisis and the European Constitution negotiations, relations improved. After the accession of Poland to the European Union on May 1, 2004, meetings of the heads of state from both countries have been organized yearly. France is the largest contributor of foreign direct investment in Poland. The French companies with the largest presence in Poland include Orange, Vivendi, Carrefour, Casino, Cr√©dit Agricole, Saint Gobain and Auchan. Controversy was caused by the phrase \\"Polish Plumber\\", which appeared in France around 2005. About one million ethnic Poles live in France, concentrated in the Nord-Pas de Calais region, in the metropolitan area of Lille and the coal-mining region (bassin minier) around Lens and Valenciennes. Polish mineurs' descendants are also found in Auberny. Poland and France have held intergovernmental consultations on several occasions. The last (out of date?) such summit took place on November 23, 2017 in Paris with President Emmanuel Macron and Prime Minister Beata Szyd≈Ço. ==Resident diplomatic missions== * France has an embassy in Warsaw and a consulate-general in Krak√≥w.Embassy of France in Poland * Poland has an embassy in Paris and a consulate-general in Lyon.Embassy of Poland in France File:Ambasada Francji (12010291186).jpgEmbassy of France in Warsaw File:A-282 kamienica Krak√≥w ul.

Steinbuch in 1799. While on a ‚Äúbotanical walk‚Äù, Steinbuch collected samples from a grass that resembled Agrostis silvatica. He examined the samples and discovered that the grass was not A. silvatica but was rather a degenerate form of Agrostis capillaris; he further discovered that A. silvatica is not a true species (or variety) but that the misclassification of the grass was due to the formation of galls by A. agrostis parasitism.Bird, A.F. 1981. The Anguina- Corynebacterium Association. Pages 303-323 in: Plant Parasitic Nematodes, B.M. Zuckerman and R.A. Rohde, eds. Academic Press, New York, NY, USA. Galls caused by A. agrostis have glumes that are 4-5 times longer than normal and can cause yield losses of up to 40-70%.Lehman, P.S. (1979). Nematology Circular. In Seed and Leaf Gall Nematodes of the Genus Anguina occurring in North America (Gainesville, Florida: Florida Department of Agricultural and Consumer Services, Division of Plant Industry).Alderman, S., Bilsland, D., Griesbach, J., Milbrath, G., Schaad, N., and Postnikova, E. 2003. Use of a Seed Scarifier for Detection and Enumeration of Galls of Anguina and Rathayibacter Species in Orchard Grass Seed. Plant disease 87:320-323. In addition to crop loss, A. agrostis associates with pathogenic bacteria Rathayibacter rathayi (formerly Corynebacterium rathayi) to cause annual ryegrass toxicity in Australia. ==Hosts and distribution== A. agrostis infects bentgrasses within the genus Agrostis as well as annual and perennial ryegrasses (Lolium spp.). The nematode can also infect 14 other genera of grasses. A. agrostis has been found in Australia, New Zealand, Western Europe, former USSR, Canada, and the United States. == Morphology == The lip region is slightly offset (3-4 ¬µm high) and the nematode has a very short stylet (10 ¬µm). A. agrostis has a three-part esophagus. The procorpus is cylindrical with a swelling near its midsection. The metacorpus is ovoid in shape and the isthmus is long and narrow. The postcorpus has three glands and is highly developed, but does not overlap the intestine.Krall, E.L. 1991. Wheat and Grass Nematodes: Anguina, Subanguina, and Related Genera. Pages 721-760 in: Manual of Agricultural Nematology, W. Nickle, ed. CRC Press, New York, NY. On average, infective juveniles (J2) measure 530 ¬µm and dauer juveniles measure 760 ¬µm; the increase in size is due to feeding and the formation of lipid droplets or storage bodies. Females range from 1.5-2.7 mm in length, are curved ventrally, and are swollen. The vulva is located near the posterior end and one ovary is present. Males are smaller (1.1-1.7 mm in length), are not as swollen, and have a small bursae that extends subterminally. One testis is present. ==Life cycle and reproduction== Infective second stage juveniles (J2) find a young host, migrate to areas of new growth and are carried up with the growing point of the plant.Goodey, T. 1932. The genus Anguillulina Gerv. & v. Ben., 1859, vel Tylenchus Bastian, 1865. Jour Helminthol 10:75-180. They may feed ectoparasitically until formation of the inflorescence, at which time the J2 invades the ovule, becomes sedentary, and a gall begins to form. Within the gall, nematodes progress through three molts to reach adulthood (J3, J4, male and female adults). Reproduction is amphimictic and females can lay up to 1000 eggs. The first molt occurs in the egg and the nematode hatches as a J2. These juveniles undergo anhydrobiosis and become the dormant dauer larvae to withstand the hot summer heat of Australia. Autumn rains rehydrate the dauer juveniles which become active to begin the life cycle over again. Only one generation is produced per year. ==Host-parasite relationship== Infective second stage juveniles colonize plants during the vegetative growth stage and may feed ectoparasitically during this time. When the inflorescence begins to form, the J2s invade the flower ovule and begin to feed endoparasitically.Stynes, B.A., and Bird, A.F. 1982. Development of galls induced in Lolium rigidum by Anguina agrostis. Phytopathology 72:336-346. Nematode feeding on floret primordia induces rapid cell division, cell enlargement, and subsequent cell degeneration and collapse. The continuation of this process results in the formation of a large central cavity (in which the now-sedentary nematodes reside) enveloped by a gall wall. Gall size increases rapidly as nematodes grow and reproduce. The gall wall is several cell layers thick. Inner cells of the gall wall (near the cavity) have dense cytoplasm with several mitochondria, indicating high levels of metabolic activity. These cells most likely provide nutrients to the nematodes. The outer layers of the gall wall are unmodified, thereby forming and maintaining the gall structure. As the plant senesces, the galls desiccate and the nematodes undergo anhydrobiosis. == Management == To mitigate the effects of annual ryegrass toxicity, farmers can move their livestock another, uninfected pasture at first sign of toxicity. Hot water treatments or chemical seed treatments have been used to produce clean seed. Infected pastures can be managed by mowing, herbicide treatments, or burning. These techniques eliminate the development of inflorescences and halt the life cycle of the nematode since they only mature to adulthood within the seed gall. A. agrostis cannot survive in the soil for more than one year and thus practices such as crop rotation or fallow have proven to be effective in managing the nematode. == References == Category:Agricultural pest nematodes Category:Tylenchida Category:Nematodes described in 1799 ","title":"Anguina agrostis"},{"id":"12370321","text":"Theodore Nikolai Lukits (November 26, 1897 ‚Äì January 20, 1992) was a Romanian American portrait and landscape painter. His initial fame came from his portraits of glamorous actresses of the silent film era, but since his death, his Asian-inspired works, figures drawn from Hispanic California and pastel landscapes have received greater attention. Lukits began his professional career as an illustrator while still in his teens. He was a still life painter, muralist and founder of the Lukits Academy of Fine Arts in Los Angeles for more than sixty years. He had the reputation of a craftsman who made his own paints from raw pigments, constructed brushes and palettes, and designed and carved frames. Lukits was responsible for keeping the \\"Beaux- Arts\\" methods of the French academic system alive in the western United States, and several of his students went on to prominent careers.Morseburg, Theodore Lukits, CAC Newsletter articles His works are displayed in many public collections. He was a member of a number of professional art organizations and won many awards in competitions. Lukits has been the subject of a number of solo museum exhibitions since his death, and his work has been included in a number of other museum exhibitions devoted to Tonalism and California and American Impressionism. ==Early history== Lukits was born Nicolae Teodorescu in Timi»ôoara, Transylvania, which was then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. His father, Theodore Lukits, Sr., was a butcher, and his mother was a homemaker. He came to the United States at age two when his family immigrated in 1899, and he grew up in St. Louis, Missouri.Ancestry.com, U.S. Department of Immigration and Naturalization, Department of State Records. U.S. census records reveals Lukits Sr. was a butcher and sausage maker. Lukits began formal studies at Washington University in St. Louis School of Fine Arts before he was twelve.Enrollment receipt in archival section of theodorelukits.org website dates to 1911. His first teacher was Edmund H. Wuerpel (1866‚Äì1958). He also studied with Richard E. Miller (1875‚Äì1943) in St. Louis, who had returned home from the art colony of Givery and was staying with his parents.Who's Who in American Art, 1940‚Äì1941, Lukits entry, page 407.Miller's presence back in the U.S. is not well known but established by the 1910 U.S. census, which shows him in St. Louis, ancestry.com records Lukits left public school after the 8th grade in order to pursue a career in art, with the full cooperation of his parents. He worked from an early age, first as an office boy and then as an airbrush artist, painting delicate girls' heads on leather.Theodorelukits.org website archive, tuition receipts, letters of recommendation ==Education in Chicago== Lukits moved to Chicago when he was fifteen to attend the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts and the Art Institute of Chicago. At the Chicago Academy he studied with the painter, illustrator and traveler Carl Werntz (1874‚Äì1944) who founded the school in 1902. He also studied with William Victor Higgins, who later became famous as one of the Taos Ten of the Taos art colony.Who's Who in American Art, 1919‚Äì1957, issues have list of instructors. Lukits began at the Art Institute of Chicago with evening, weekend and summer classes because he was unable to enroll as a full-time student until he turned eighteen.Art Institute of Chicago, Circular of Instruction, 1913‚Äì1914, 1914‚Äì1915, 1915‚Äì1916, and 1917‚Äì1918 list his name. Lukits studied with a number of instructors at the institute, but his main teachers and mentors were the American Impressionist Karl Albert Buehr (1866‚Äì1952), the society portrait painter Wellington J. Reynolds (1866‚Äì1949) and the figurative painter Harry Mills Walcott 1877‚Äì1930). Lukits worked under Edwin Blashfield (1848‚Äì1936) at some point in his Chicago years, presumably as an assistant on a mural project in the Midwest, but it is not known when.Blashfield delivered the Scammon lectures in Chicago in 1912 and did a number of mural projects in the Midwest. He also studied with the realist painters Robert Henri (1865‚Äì1929), Charles Webster Hawthorne (1872‚Äì1930), and George Bellows (1882‚Äì1925), who were guest instructors at the Art Institute during Lukits' tenure.Who's Who in American Art, 1919‚Äì1957 and other listed reference works Another painter Lukits was influenced by was Housep Pushman (1877‚Äì1966). He first met the Armenian artist in 1916 in Chicago, where he had an exhibition at the Art Institute of his figurative works and Asian-themed still lifes. During his student days, Lukits shared a studio with the Swedish-born painter Christian von Schneidau (1893‚Äì1976). The two became friends in Chicago and would later renew their friendship in California where they both would paint portraits of movie stars.Theodorelukits.org website has story and photos He won every major award at the Art Institute, including the Bryan Lathrop Traveling Scholarship. He paid for his studies by painting illustrations for major publications such as Cosmopolitan and The Saturday Evening Post. After his graduation in 1918, he returned for post-graduate work the following year under Karl Buehr.AIC Circular of Instruction, 1918‚Äì1919 His last period of artistic study was a special scholarship which enabled him to study and travel with the Czech master of Art Nouveau, painter and Illustrator Alphonse Mucha (1860‚Äì1939) who was exhibiting his Slav Epic murals in the United States. Lukits also attended Barnes Medical College to study human anatomy.Who's Who; other reference works below list Mucha and Barnes. ==Professional career== Study of an Old Man, Theodore Lukits (1915) After he arrived in California he rapidly became known for his portraits of early Hollywood figures Theda Bara, Pola Negri, Mae Murray and Alla Nazimova.Morseburg, CAC Newsletter, December, 1998, p. 2 The portrait Lukits painted of the Mexican actor Dolores del R√≠o was exhibited at the premiere of one of her films and reproduced in newspapers in Los Angeles and Mexico City. Lukits opened the Lukits Academy in early 1924 and continued teaching until his retirement at age ninety. He was a well known plein-air painter, choosing the pastel medium for more than one thousand sketches he did on location in the Sierra Nevada, Death Valley, the Mojave Desert, along the California coast and at the Grand Canyon.Morseburg, Jonathan Art Foundation Book, 2010 In the early 1930s Lukits also did a series of paintings of vaqueros and female dancers that are now known as the Fiesta Suite, as studies for a mural project for Howard Hughes that was never completed.Morseburg, Lukits, CAC Newsletter, December, 1998 This series of pastel and oil studies depicted many of the horsemen and young Latino actresses who came to Los Angeles to work as riders, stuntmen and extras in Hollywood films. Lukits has been the subject of retrospective exhibitions at the Pacific Asia Museum in Pasadena, California; the Carnegie Art Museum in Oxnard, California; the Muckenthaller Cultural Center in Fullerton, California; and Mission San Juan Capistrano. In addition to art students, Lukits taught Hollywood makeup artists. The prominent makeup artist Louis Hippe (1909‚Äì1967) advocated the study of drawing and anatomy under Lukits in order to understand the planes and facial structure of the human head and how it would appear under artificial light, and a number of other makeup artists followed him to Lukit's atelier in the 1930s and 1940s.News clipping, Theodorelukits.org website ==Exhibitions== From the mid-1920s through the early 1930s, Lukits had a number of solo exhibitions in southern California. The fall of 1926 may have been his most successful season. He had an exhibition at the Southby Salon on Larchmont Boulevard that opened on September 23. The review in the Los Angeles Times stated, \\"About 100 people attended. The event of the evening was the first showing of the artist's striking portrait of Ethel Wade.\\"Los Angeles Times, September 26, 1926 Souvenir of Seville, oil on canvas, 80\\" √ó 40\\" (1926), private collection In November he had a showing in the salon of the Hollywood restaurant the Montmatre Cafe. His work included portraits, landscapes and marines. Along with Count Tolstoy and the actress Dolores Del Rio, he was the guest at a pair of receptions.Montmatre catalogs in Lukits archive, Theodorelukits.org Lukits exhibited at a number of the premier Los Angeles galleries during the 1930s. In February 1931, he had an exhibition at the Desert Gallery in Palm Springs. In June he had a large exhibition of landscapes, still lifes and portraits at the Stendahl Galleries.Stendahl brochure listed below, records in Archives of American Art. Stendahl represented Guy Rose and William Wendt as well. In 1935 he had a solo exhibition at the Barbara Hotel in Santa Barbara. In 1937 he was invited to participate in a special exhibition at Harriet Day's Desert Inn Gallery in Palm Springs, Twenty Paintings by Twenty Artists, which included the work of Maurice Braun, Hanson Puthuff and Maynard Dixon.Day, Harriet, Twenty Paintings by Twenty Artists brochure listed below That same year Harry Muir Kurtzworth curated an exhibition at the Los Angeles Public Library titled Tonal Impressionism, with the works of Frank Tenney Johnson, Jack Wilkinson Smith, Alson Clark and Lukits.Kurtzworth, Harry, Muir, Tonal Impressionism catalog listed below. ==Marriages== Lukits met the aspiring artist and actress Eleanor Merriam (1909‚Äì1948) in 1931 when she came to study with him.Morseburg, CAC, December, 1998, p. 4 She became one of his' favorite models. He painted a well-exhibited pastel portrait of her in 1932, a prize-winning artistic oil portrait titled Gesture in 1934, and another portrait in 1936. In 1937, the couple eloped to Santa Barbara and were married.\\"Theodore Lukits Reveals Nuptials\\", April, 1937, scanned clipping in Lukits archive, unpaginated. LAT does not have many old issues online as does NYT. In 1940, they purchased a comfortable Spanish-style home on Citrus Avenue, just south of Wilshire Boulevard, adjacent to the Hancock Park neighborhood of Los Angeles. Working together, Eleanor Merriam Lukits' work showed her husband's influence. He often worked on her pastels and paintings, and his bolder, more confident, stroke can be discerned, according to his biographer. Eleanor Lukits was outgoing, and drew her husband into the social whirl of Los Angeles, where she cultivated patrons and portrait sitters. The couple showed their work together extensively and she participated in many of the exhibitions for women artists of the Southland in the 1930s and 1940s. In 1948, as she and her husband were transferring gasoline from one container to another in their basement, the vapors were ignited by a pilot light. Both Eleanor and Theodore were burned, but her internal injuries led to her death in the hospital.\\"Eleanor Lukits Dies of Explosion Burns\\", Los Angeles Times, September 26, 1948 Several years later, Lukits began dating Lucille Greathouse, a Disney animator and also one of his students. They were married in 1952 after a short courtship.Morseburg, CAC, December, 1998, p. 8 Lukits and his second wife lived a quieter social life, but they exhibited and were active with a number of Southern California's art organizations in the 1950s and early 1960s. From 1952 to 1990, Lucile Lukits helped her husband run his school and business affairs, and her assistance helped put the school on firmer financial footing. After her husband's death, Lucile Lukits took over management of her husband's artwork and estate before passing the responsibility on to his students. In 1997, feeling the effects of Parkinson's disease, she moved to Utah to be closer to her family. She died in Utah in 2003 at the age of ninety-four. There were no children from either of Lukits' marriages. ==Late career== The last generation of students that Theodore Lukits taught in the 1970s and 1980s included a number of notable figures. The plein air pastelist Arny Karl (1940‚Äì2000) studied with Lukits from 1968 to 1978.Karl's Ask Art Biography The plein air and figurative artist Peter Seitz Adams (b. 1950) CAC Web Site apprenticed with Lukits for seven years from 1970 to 1977;See Adams' \\"Recollections\\" in The Pastels of Theodore Lukits, Carnegie Art Museum, p. 4-5 (1991) and the western and plein air landscape artist Tim Solliday (b. 1952) apprenticed with Lukits for five years.See Solliday's \\"Recollections'\\" in The Pastels of Theodore Lukits, Carnegie Museum, p. 3 (1991) Karl, Adams, and Solliday went on to work extensively in the pastel medium. In 1990, Lucile and Theodore Lukits, who was then in declining health, donated a large collection of his work to the Jonathan Art Foundation in Los Angeles. This collection, which includes a large selection of his pastels as well as a number of portraits, has been loaned out to museums for exhibitions that have been mounted after his death.See Lucile Lukits (1909‚Äì2003), Lukits Academy tuition records, 1952‚Äì1990, Lukits archive for records of students, unnumbered. Also web references to many of these artists as students of Lukits. ==Posthumous exhibitions== Since his death in 1992, Theodore Lukits' work has been the subject of solo exhibitions in California museums. His work has also been part of many other museum exhibitions devoted to California Plein-Air Painting and figurative art. In 1998, a traveling show was organized under the auspices of the California Art Club, titled Theodore N. Lukits: An American Orientalist. The exhibition focused on Lukits' Asian-inspired work, and included stylized portraits, plein-air landscape pastels with Japanese art influences, and a few still lifes of Asian antiques.Morseburg, Jeffrey, Theodore Lukits, An American Orientalist, Exhibition Catalog, p. 1-16 This exhibition opened at the Pacific Asia Museum in Pasadena, California, then traveled to the Carnegie Art Museum in Oxnard and culminated at the Muckenthaler Cultural Center in Fullerton, where it was combined with some of Lukits' Hispanic-themed works for a new exhibition title, Theodore N. Lukits: From Mandarins to Mariachis.Invitation on Lukits.org website These exhibitions included many of his high-key, brightly-colored works. Lukits made many studies and portraits of Mexican and Mexican-American sitters, some of which were preparatory works for mural projects. These works were the subject of two different exhibitions at Mission San Juan Capistrano, in 1998 and 1999. The second exhibition, titled Theodore N. Lukits: The Spirit of Old California, was centered on what has been called his Fiesta Suite, a collection of paintings that was used for studies for a mural of an old California fiesta scene created for Howard Hughes. It included more than a dozen figurative works, a collection of pastels, and some works that were created en plein air on the grounds of the missions in the 1920s.San Juan Capistrano catalogs listed below, also TFAOL website One of his students, Kalan Brunink, followed his lead and became principal artist of the famed Old Town Olvera Street, Los Angeles and has a notable collection of Spanish- Mexican-American paintings and Mission San Juan Capistrano works. The Southern Alleghenies Museum of Art has a notable collection of plein-air pastels by Theodore Lukits. These have been central to two exhibitions at SAMA, one in 1999,Tomor, Contemporary Romanticism: Landscapes in Pastel devoted to landscape pastels, and the other in 2008, which featured watercolors and pastels.\\"From Charles Burchfield\\" PDF Mission San Juan Capistrano was the site of another Lukits exhibition in 2001 titled Romance of the Mission, which was held in the courtyard of the mission in conjunction with the annual benefit dinner.Romance of the Mission program, Mission San Juan Capistrano, p. 1-3 ==Partial exhibition record== * 1926 ‚Äì Solo Exhibition, Theodore Lukits, The Southby Art Salon, Hollywood, California, opened September 23, 1926 * 1926 ‚Äì Solo Exhibition, Exhibition of Portraits and Paintings by Theodore Lukits, Cafe Montmatre Salon, Hollywood, California November 4, 1926 (23 works including portraits and landscapes) * 1926 ‚Äì Solo Exhibition, Annual Winter Exhibition, Portraits and Paintings by Theodore Lukits, Cafe Montmatre Salon, Hollywood, California November 25, 1926 (39 works including portraits and landscapes) * 1928 ‚Äì Solo Exhibition, Edgewater Beach Club, Santa Monica, California, September, 1928 (22 works including portraits, landscapes and a maritime work) * 1930 ‚Äì Group Exhibition, Ebell Salon, Los Angeles, California, March, 1930 * 1930 ‚Äì Solo Exhibition, Ainslie Galleries, Los Angeles, California, November 1‚Äì30, 1930 16 (16 works including figurative works and landscapes) * 1931 ‚Äì Solo Exhibition, Desert Paintings by Theodore Lukits, Desert Art Gallery, Palm Springs, California, February 1‚Äì28, 1931 * 1931 ‚Äì Solo Exhibition, Stendahl Galleries, Ambassador Hotel, Los Angeles, California, June 1‚Äì13, 1931, (27 works including decorative portraits and landscapes) * 1935 - Solo Exhibition, Barbara Hotel, Santa Barbara, California, Circa 1935 (exhibition featuring Sierra Moonlight and Laughing Mood, hosted by John Yuke) * 1935 ‚Äì Group Exhibition, Biltmore Salon, Hotel Biltmore, Los Angeles, California * 1937 ‚Äì Group Exhibition, International Aeronautical Art Exhibition, Los Angeles Museum, Los Angeles, California, February 5‚Äì19, 1937 (won E.K.

At first a hunting lodge was erected on a beautiful terrace overlooking a deep forested valley. The present ch√¢teau was erected later by King Leopold II of Belgium. The edifice was designed by his court architect Alphonse Balat. Since then it has always served as a holiday retreat to the Royal Family. In 1960 it was the venue for the press presentation of King Baudouin's fianc√© Dona Fabiola de Mora y Aragon. More recently the children of Philippe, King of the Belgians, Princess Elisabeth, Duchess of Brabant, Prince Gabriel, Prince Emmanuel and Princess El√©onore were baptised in the chapel of the ch√¢teau. The Royal Family also owned other castles in the direct vicinity of Ciergnon. Fenffe Castle is still in use as a holiday retreat by the royal family. Ardenne Castle was, according to the wish of King Leopold II, converted into a luxury hotel. It was closed after World War II and destroyed by fire in 1968. ==See also== *List of castles in Belgium ==References== * Belgium Royal Family ;Specific Category:Royal residences in Belgium Ciergnon Ciergnon ","title":"Royal Castle of Ciergnon"},{"id":"12370371","text":"5 Squadron or 5th Squadron may refer to: Aviation squadrons: * No. 5 Squadron RAAF, a unit of the Royal Australian Air Force * No. 5 Squadron RCAF, a unit of the Royal Canadian Air Force * No. 5 Squadron RNZAF, a unit of the Royal New Zealand Air Force * No. 5 Squadron (Pakistan Air Force), a unit of the Pakistan Air Force * No. 5 Squadron SLAF, a unit of the Sri Lanka Air Force * 5 Squadron SAAF, a unit of the South African Air Force * No. 5 Squadron RAF, a unit of the United Kingdom Royal Air Force * 5th Special Operations Squadron, a unit of the United States Air Force * 5th Space Operations Squadron, a unit of the United States Air Force * 5th Space Launch Squadron, a unit of the United States Air Force Naval squadrons: * 5th Battle Squadron, a formation of the United Kingdom Royal Navy Ground combat squadrons: * 2/5th Commando Squadron (Australia), a unit of the Australian Army ==See also== * Squadron No. 5, a 1939 Soviet film ","title":"5 Squadron"},{"id":"12370419","text":"Schultzichthys is a genus of pencil catfishes native to South America. ==Species== There are currently two recognized species in this genus: * Schultzichthys bondi (Myers, 1942) * Schultzichthys gracilis Dahl, 1960 S. bondi is from the Amazon and Orinoco River basins, while S. gracilis is from the Guayabero River of the Orinoco River basin in Colombia.

Thomas's father was P. V. John (Ayyapilla Sir) encountered Christianity through a native missionary (Kappiar Upadesi) who taught him John 3:16. This resulted in leaving his Hindu Brahmin background. He married Sossamma and they had five boys(John, Daniel, Thomas, Jacob, George) and one girl(Leelaamma). P J Thomas is the third oldest among the siblings. Thomas attended Serampore University and earned a Diploma in Theology. He became the principal of the IPC free School. Following his marriage to Aleyamma from Keezhvaipur, Mallappally, he left for Australia for higher studies. He went to England from Australia and to the U.S, where he attended Wheaton College (Illinois) and got a Master's degree in Comparative Religion. He taught at Wheaton for a short time before returning to India in 1952. Before he went back to India, he was instrumental in bringing the then three senior Indian Pentecostal Church pastors, K.E. Abraham, K.C. Cherian, and P.M. Samuel to the U.S. He also traveled with Abraham and interpreted for him across the U.S. Following his return to India, the late J. Varghese (Kochusir) persuaded him to settle down at Tiruvalla. He purchased the present Sharon property in March 1953 and made it their home. The fame of \\"Sharon\\" came with two revival meetings and the opening of the Bible College at Sharon compound. On Nov. 30, 1953 missionaries arrived who conducted 30 days of revival and healing ministry, the last week's attendance was over 100,000 a night. These meeting were conducted without any foreign donation, only from the free will offering of the people who attended. Hundreds turned to the Lord and were baptized. Many were healed of their illnesses. Rev. John E.Douglas and Rev R. W. Schambach who were instrumental for this meetings. With the completion of the Sharon Hall, Sharon Bible College was born in 1955 where several pastors have been trained. The 1950s were a period of unrest within the Indian Pentecostal Church. During the split in the Church the Sharon Hall was often used as a place of mediation, but Thomas remained neutral. Several independent churches approached him to help them with building churches and buying burial grounds and to give them a hand in common fellowship. As a result he decided to remain independent. Although it had a small beginning the church began to grow beginning the mid sixties, he called it a fellowship of churches thus it is called Sharon Fellowship Churches of India, but commonly called as Sharon Church. ==See also== * History of Pentecostalism in India * Critique of Pentecostal Mission * New Christian movements in India == References  External links == * Trumpet Magazine * P.C.N.A.K.

He was ruined through his largely innocent association with the fraudster Sidney Stanley, which was exposed by the Lynskey Tribunal in 1948. Gibson was born in Calton, a suburb of Glasgow, the son of Irish-born Johnston Gibson, a drysalter (maker of vinegar and castor oil) who later successively owned a fish and chip shop, a fish shop and a newsagent. Gibson's mother, Mary, was Scottish. Although he was a good scholar, Gibson left school at the age of eleven and held a variety of jobs before moving to England in 1910 to become an attendant at Winwick Asylum in Warrington. On 10 July 1910 he became one of the co-founders of the National Asylum Workers' Union and was elected its first Secretary. He became Vice- President in 1911 and Assistant Organising Secretary in 1912. In 1913 he became full-time General Secretary. The union was renamed the Mental Hospital and Institutional Workers' Union in 1930 and amalgamated with others to form the Confederation of Health Service Employees (COHSE) in 1947. Gibson remained General Secretary throughout these changes, but resigned in 1948. He was elected to the General Council of the Trades Union Congress in 1928 and remained a member until his retirement in 1948. He chaired the General Council and was President of the TUC from 1940 to 1941. Gibson enlisted in the Royal Garrison Artillery in 1915 and was commissioned in 1917. He was demobbed in 1919 as a substantive Lieutenant, but as he was commanding a battery he was probably acting in a higher rank. He had been twice mentioned in despatches, and was gassed, which left him a semi-asthmatic for the rest of his life. From 1940 to 1941 Gibson served as a full-time Director of the Children's Overseas Reception Board, responsible for evacuating British children overseas. In 1941 he visited both Sweden and the United States on official missions. He also served in many other positions during and after the war, including as Vice- Chairman of the National Savings Committee (1939-1949), a director of the Bank of England (1946-1949), Chairman of the North West Regional Board for Industry, Chairman of the North Western Electricity Board and Chairman of the BBC General Council. In 1946 he was appointed Companion of Honour (CH). In 1949 the Lynskey Tribunal found that Gibson had used his official influence to assist Sidney Stanley to set up a business in expectation of personal gain. The subsequent scandal compelled Gibson to resign from all official posts, although he continued to deny all the allegations. At some time before the First World War Gibson married Ellen Crossfield, the daughter of a Manchester hotelier, but she was killed in a tram accident in Blackpool. He later married Eva Crabtree, whose first husband had been killed in action in 1917. He had one daughter with Ellen and a further five children with Eva. ==Sources== *Roodhouse, M.

Eukaryotic MCM consists of six gene products, Mcm2‚Äì7, which form a heterohexamer. As a critical protein for cell division, MCM is also the target of various checkpoint pathways, such as the S-phase entry and S-phase arrest checkpoints. Both the loading and activation of MCM helicase are strictly regulated and are coupled to cell growth cycles. Deregulation of MCM function has been linked to genomic instability and a variety of carcinomas. == History and structure == Homology shared by members of the Mcm2-7 protein family. Homology among the six members of the family are indicated in black. Homology of each member across species is indicated in colour. The minichromosome maintenance proteins were named after a yeast genetics screen for mutants defective in the regulation of DNA replication initiation. The rationale behind this screen was that if replication origins were regulated in a manner analogous to transcription promoters, where transcriptional regulators showed promoter specificity, then replication regulators should also show origin specificity. Since eukaryotic chromosomes contain multiple replication origins and the plasmids contain only one, a slight defect in these regulators would have a dramatic effect on the replication of plasmids but little effect on chromosomes. In this screen, mutants conditional for plasmid loss were identified. In a secondary screen, these conditional mutants were selected for defects in plasmid maintenance against a collection of plasmids each carrying a different origin sequence. Two classes of mcm mutants were identified: Those that affected the stability of all minichromosomes and others that affected the stability of only a subset of the minichromosomes. The former were mutants defective in chromosome segregation such as mcm16, mcm20 and mcm21. Among the latter class of origin- specific mutants were mcm1, mcm2, mcm3, mcm5 and mcm10. Later on, others identified Mcm4, Mcm6 and Mcm7 in yeasts and other eukaryotes based on homology to Mcm2p, Mcm3p and Mcm5p expanding the MCM family to six, subsequently known as the Mcm2-7 family. In archaea, the heterohexamer ring is replaced by a homohexamer made up of a single type mcm protein, pointing at a history of gene duplicaion and diversification. Mcm1 and Mcm10 are also involved in DNA replication, directly or indirectly, but have no sequence homology to the Mcm2-7 family. == Function in DNA replication initiation and elongation == MCM2-7 is required for both DNA replication initiation and elongation; its regulation at each stage is a central feature of eukaryotic DNA replication. During G1 phase, the two head-to-head Mcm2-7 rings serve as the scaffold for the assembly of the bidirectional replication initiation complexes at the replication origin. During S phase, the Mcm2-7 complex forms the catalytic core of the Cdc45-MCM-GINS helicase - the DNA unwinding engine of the replisome.  G1/pre-replicative complex assembly  Site selection for replication origins is carried out by the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC), a six subunit complex (Orc1-6). During the G1 phase of the cell cycle, Cdc6 is recruited by ORC to form a launching pad for the loading of two head- to-head Mcm2-7 hexamers, also known as the pre-replication complex (pre-RC). There is genetic and biochemical evidence that the recruitment of the double hexamer may involve either one or two ORCs. Soluble Mcm2-7 hexamer forms a flexible left-handed open-ringed structure stabilised by Cdt1 prior to its loading onto chromatin, one at a time. The structure of the ORC-Cdc6-Cdt1-MCM (OCCM) intermediate formed after the loading of the first Cdt1-Mcm2-7 heptamer indicates that the winged helix domain at the C-terminal extensions (CTE) of the Mcm2-7 complex firmly anchor onto the surfaces created by the ORC-Cdc6 ring structure around origin DNA. The fusion of the two head-to-head Mcm2-7 hexamers is believed to be facilitated by the removal of Cdt1, leaving the NTDs of the two MCM hexamers flexible for inter-ring interactions. The loading of MCM2-7 onto DNA is an active process that requires ATP hydrolysis by both Orc1-6 and Cdc6. This process is coined \\"Replication Licensing\\" as it is a prerequisite for DNA replication initiation in every cell division cycle.  Late G1/early S - initiation  In late G1/early S phase, the pre-RC is activated for DNA unwinding by the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and DDK. This facilitates the loading of additional replication factors (e.g., Cdc45, MCM10, GINS, and DNA polymerases) and unwinding of the DNA at the origin. Once pre-RC formation is complete, Orc1-6 and Cdc6 are no longer required for MCM2-7 retention at the origin, and they are dispensable for subsequent DNA replication.  S-phase/elongation  Upon entry into S phase, the activity of the CDKs and the Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK) Cdc7 promotes the assembly of replication forks, likely in part by activating MCM2-7 to unwind DNA. Following DNA polymerase loading, bidirectional DNA replication commences. During S phase, Cdc6 and Cdt1 are degraded or inactivated to block additional pre-RC formation, and bidirectional DNA replication ensues. When the replication fork encounters lesions in the DNA, the S-phase checkpoint response slows or stops fork progression and stabilizes the association of MCM2-7 with the replication fork during DNA repair. == Role in replication licensing == The replication licensing system acts to ensure that the no section of the genome is replicated more than once in a single cell cycle. The inactivation of any of at least five of the six MCM subunits during S phase quickly blocks ongoing elongation. As a critical mechanism to ensure only a single round of DNA replication, the loading of additional MCM2-7 complexes into pre-RCs is inactivated by redundant means after passage into S phase. MCM2-7 activity can also be regulated during elongation. The loss of replication fork integrity, an event precipitated by DNA damage, unusual DNA sequence, or insufficient deoxyribonucleotide precursors, can lead to the formation of DNA double-strand breaks and chromosome rearrangements. Normally, these replication problems trigger an S-phase checkpoint that minimizes genomic damage by blocking further elongation and physically stabilizing protein-DNA associations at the replication fork until the problem is fixed. This stabilization of the replication fork requires the physical interaction of MCM2-7 with Mrc1, Tof1, and Csm3 (M/T/C complex). In the absence of these proteins, dsDNA unwinding and replisome movement powered by MCM2-7 continue, but DNA synthesis stops. At least part of this stop is due to the dissociation of polymerase Œµ from the replication fork. == Biochemical structure == Each subunit in the MCM structure contains two large N- and C-terminal domains. The N-terminal domain consists of three small sub-domains and appears to be used mainly for structural organization. The N-domain can coordinate with a neighboring subunit‚Äôs C-terminal AAA+ helicase domain through a long and conserved loop. This conserved loop, named the allosteric control loop, has been shown to play a role in regulating interactions between N- and C-terminal regions by facilitating communication between the domains in response to ATP hydrolysis [10]. The N-domain also establishes the in vitro 3‚Ä≤‚Üí5‚Ä≤ directionality of MCM. == Models of DNA unwinding == Regarding the physical mechanism of how a hexameric helicase unwinds DNA, two models have been proposed based on in vivo and in vitro data. In the \\"steric\\" model, the helicase tightly translocates along one strand of DNA while physically displacing the complementary strand. In the \\"pump\\" model, pairs of hexameric helicases unwind duplex DNA by either twisting it apart or extruding it through channels in the complex.  Steric model  The steric model hypothesizes that the helicase encircles dsDNA and, after local melting of the duplex DNA at the origin, translocates away from the origin, dragging a rigid proteinaceous \\"wedge\\" (either part of the helicase itself or another associated protein) that separates the DNA strands.  Pump model  The pump model postulates that multiple helicases load at replication origins, translocate away from one another, and in some manner eventually become anchored in place. They then rotate dsDNA in opposite directions, resulting in the unwinding of the double helix in the intervening region. The pump model has also been proposed to be restricted to the melting of origin DNA while the Mcm2-7 complexes are still anchored at the origin just before replication initiation. == Role in cancer == Various MCMs have been shown to promote cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo especially in certain types of cancer cell lines. The association between MCMs and proliferation in cancer cell lines is mostly attributed to its ability to enhance DNA replication. The roles of MCM2 and MCM7 in cell proliferation have been demonstrated in various cellular contexts and even in human specimens. MCM2 has been shown to be frequently expressed in proliferating premalignant lung cells. Its expression was associated with cells having a higher proliferation potential in non- dysplastic squamous epithelium, malignant fibrous histiocytomas, and endometrial carcinoma, while MCM2 expression was also correlated higher mitotic index in breast cancer specimens. Similarly, many research studies have shown the link between MCM7 expression and cell proliferation. Expression of MCM7 was significantly correlated with the expression of Ki67 in choriocarcinomas, lung cancer, papillary urothelial neoplasia, esophageal cancer, and endometrial cancer. Its expression was also associated with a higher proliferative index in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and cancer. == See also == *Human genes encoding MCM proteins include: **MCM2 **MCM3 **MCM4 **MCM5 **MCM6 **MCM7 **MCM8 **MCM9 **MCM10 == References  External links == * *macromolecular structures of MCM at the EM Data Bank(EMDB) __FORCETOC__ Category:DNA replication ","title":"Minichromosome maintenance"},{"id":"12370462","text":"Anguina may refer to: * Anguina (nematode), a nematode genus in the family Anguinidae * Anguina, a synonym of the plant genus Trichosanthes ","title":"Anguina"},{"id":"12370464","text":"Beatrice of B√©ziers was the second wife of Raymond VI of Toulouse.

For all but the Ormoc assault, she remained on the scene after the initial landings, helping extend the mineswept areas and providing antisubmarine and antiaircraft protection to the transports. Few mines were encountered, but kamikaze resistance was intense, and the ships saw much antiaircraft action. == Under fire from Japanese shore batteries == On 13 February, Scrimmage and her division began pre-invasion sweeps in Manila Bay in preparation for the landings at Mariveles and Corregidor. While sweeping off Corregidor on the 14th, the minesweepers came within 5,000 yards of the island and were repeatedly straddled by Japanese fire before supporting ships silenced the enemy's guns. Scrimmage continued sweeping in Manila Bay through 19 February, and her division earned a Navy Unit Commendation for the operation. During the next two and one-half months, Scrimmage carried out various local sweeps in support of fighting in the Philippines, the most notable being a pre-assault sweep for the landings at Legaspi, Luzon on 1 April, and an 8-day sweep in the Sulu Sea off Palawan beginning on 22 April. On 9 May, the ship arrived at Morotai to prepare for operations in the Dutch East Indies. == Supporting Borneo landings == Between 7 and 18 June, Scrimmage supported the landings at Brunei Bay, Borneo. During the operation, the minesweepers came under fire from shore batteries and one ship, , was sunk by a mine on 8 June. On completion of the operation, Scrimmage returned to Subic Bay for emergency engine repairs, arriving on 21 June. == End-of-war activity == The minesweeper left the Philippines on 6 September and arrived at Nagoya, Japan, on 9 October, having weathered three typhoons en route. Between 16 October and 3 December, she swept Japanese minefields in the approaches to the Inland Sea and in Tsushima Strait. On 9 December she sailed from Sasebo for home. == Post-war decommissioning == Arriving at Orange, Texas, on 2 April 1946, she was decommissioned there on 22 June 1946 and placed in reserve. The ship was reclassified MSF-297 on 7 February 1955. She was struck from the Navy list on 1 April 1960 and sold. She became a British merchantman named MV Giant II and was used as a cable ship; sold in March 1968 to the Dillingham Corporation and leased to the University of Hawaii as a research vessel; renamed MS Mahi; sold in 1982 to Dacor Scuba Diving to be sunk as an artificial reef; and sunk in the Pacific Ocean approximately one mile off Waianae, Hawai'i, in 90 feet (27.4 meters) of water. A United States flag was raised on the mast of Mahi on 26 May 2008 by retired United States Army Sergeant First Class Shawn McElravy to commemorate Memorial Day; he replaced the flag with a new one on 25 May 2009. == Awards == Scrimmage received 6 battle stars for her World War II service. == References  External links == * * Category:Admirable-class minesweepers Category:Ships built in Seattle Category:1943 ships Category:World War II minesweepers of the United States Category:Ships sunk as dive sites Category:Maritime incidents in 1982 Category:Shipwrecks of Hawaii ","title":"USS Scrimmage (AM-297)"},{"id":"12370578","text":"Odisea (Spanish) or Odisseia (Portuguese) is a documentary cable channel available in Spain and Portugal, with feeds in Portuguese or Spanish.

Its natural habitats are humid lowland and montane forests. It is threatened by habitat loss and is listed by the IUCN as being \\"endangered\\". ==Description== The snout-to-vent length of the polkadot poison frog is . The hind limbs are short and the forelimbs relatively long with large hands. The fingers are unwebbed, the second one being longer than the first, and all but the first finger have flat discs of thickened skin. This frog has brown eyes and no teeth in its upper jaw. Males have a small vocal sac on the throat, and when not in use, this hangs in folds. The skin on the belly and inside the thighs is coarsely wrinkled. This frog is black or some shade of brown with roundish yellow spots, which often have a raised surface. The call made by the male is similar to that of closely related species but can be distinguished by its pitch, duration and the length of time between successive calls. ==Biology== The polkadot poison frog is arboreal in its habits, living among the mosses and epiphytic plants growing on trees in the dense forests of western Panama at altitudes of up to above sea level. The male typically chooses the leaf of a bromeliad plant on which to call to attract a mate. If receptive, the female joins him in a courtship ritual after which a small batch of about four to eight eggs is laid on the leaf and fertilised by the male. The female remains with the eggs for a short time after which the male covers them with his body. The newly hatched tadpoles are carried to water bodies, such as pools forming in the rosettes of bromeliads, where they develop. ==Status== The total extent of occurrence of the polkadot poison frog is less than , and even within this range, there are a number of separate subpopulations. The population trend of this frog is unknown but the forests in which it lives are being affected by logging. Another factor limiting its numbers may be collection for the pet trade, and it may be susceptible to the disease chytridiomycosis. However, part of its range is within the bounds of the Parque Internacional La Amistad and the Bosque Protector Palo Seco. Taking these various factors into account, the IUCN has listed the conservation status of this species as \\"endangered\\". ==References== arborea Category:Amphibians described in 1984 Category:Amphibians of Panama Category:Endemic fauna of Panama Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Polkadot poison frog"},{"id":"12370734","text":"The student cap used by members of Teknologf√∂reningen.

It is endemic to the state of Par√° in Brazil. The frog is believed to have received its common name from the fact that its tadpoles sometimes develop in the hard capsules of the Brazil nut tree, which are common in its range. The nuts fall to the forest floor where they are broken open by agoutis and other animals seeking the seeds, and empty husks fill with water. ==Description== The Brazil-nut poison frog is a very small frog with a snout-to-vent length of ; females are usually larger than males. The dorsal surface is of a shiny black colour with spots and markings of white or various shades of yellow. There is a bright yellow or orange spot where the foreleg joins the body and two more similarly coloured spots on either side of the knee joint on the hind leg, which combine to make a single large spot when the animal is stationary. A further spot on the underside of the calf is only visible from below. ==Distribution== The Brazil-nut poison frog is endemic to the rainforest of central Brazil. It is known from several localities in the state of Par√°; from Cachoeira Juru√°, Xingu River, the type locality; from Taperinha some to the north west; and from Flona Tapajos, Santar√©m. These locations are some distance apart and it is likely that this frog has a more widespread distribution than is known but has passed undetected in other parts of its range. It lives among the leaf litter on the forest floor and sometimes climbs into low vegetation. ==Biology== The Brazil-nut poison frog is diurnal and feeds on ants, termites and other small invertebrates. The eggs are laid on the ground where they are guarded by the male. When they hatch, it carries the tadpoles to temporary pools such as water holes in trees and stumps, and water-filled empty nut cases on the forest floor. Here the tadpoles develop rapidly, devouring mosquito larvae, smaller tadpoles, and other creatures that share these ephemeral pools, as well as suitably-sized plant material. This frog may become sexually mature in five to seven months. ==Status== The Brazil-nut poison frog is common within its range and the population trend seems stable, although data on its conservation status is somehow insufficient.

Originally described as Dendrobates granuliferus, it was moved to Oophaga in 1994. Its natural habitats are tropical humid lowland forests; it is threatened by habitat loss. ==Description== The granular poison frog is a small frog with slender limbs growing to about . Its skin is finely granulated and its colour is typically bright orange head, body and upper arms and bluish-green underparts, legs and lower arms. In the vicinity of Quepos, Costa Rica, there is a colour morph in which the orange colour is replaced with olive green. ==Distribution and habitat== The granular poison frog is native to Costa Rica and Panama. Its range extends from southwestern Costa Rica through the adjacent area of south- western Panama at heights of up to above sea level. It also occurs in Piedras Blancas National Park in south-eastern Costa Rica. It inhabits the leaf litter of the floor of humid low altitude forests. ==Behaviour== The granular poison frog is a diurnal terrestrial species. Breeding takes place in the rainy season and the female lays groups of three or four eggs in curled up dead leaves, under stones, in twig forks and in leaf axils just above the ground. The male guards the eggs and keeps them moist with his urine. When they hatch, the female carries the tadpoles singly to temporary water bodies such as hollows in trees, leaf axils of species such as Dieffenbachia and to bromeliads, at heights of a metre or two off the ground. The volume of water in these cavities averages . The female feeds the tadpoles on an ongoing basis by laying unfertilised eggs in the water bodies. The frog is an aposematic animal, and it uses poison only for self-defense from predators. Its bright colors are used as a warning signal to all possible predators. Experimental studies in Costa Rica suggest the male granular poison frog spends the majority of its time and energy defending its calling site. These warning signals are more vocal (acoustic) than visual. If an encroaching male dared to approach too closely, a fight could ensue.Amphibian rescue Information about the granular poison frog ==Status== The IUCN has listed this species as being \\"Vulnerable\\" because its range is relatively small, its numbers seem to be declining and it is threatened by destruction of its rainforest habitat. ==ReferencesExternal links== * * Category:Oophaga Category:Frogs of North America Category:Aposematic species Category:Amphibians of Costa Rica Category:Amphibians of Panama Category:Amphibians described in 1958 Category:Taxa named by Edward Harrison Taylor Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Granular poison frog"},{"id":"12370815","text":"Lehmann's poison frog or the red-banded poison frog (Oophaga lehmanni) is a species of frogs in the family Dendrobatidae endemic to a small part of western Colombia. Its natural habitats are submontane tropical rainforests. It is threatened by habitat loss and collection for the pet trade, and the IUCN lists it as being \\"critically endangered\\". It was named after Colombian conservation biologist Federico Carlos Lehmann. ==Description== Lehmann's poison frog has a smooth skin and exhibits aposematic colouration, which warns predators that it is inedible. There are red, orange and yellow morphs of this frog. The background colour is black or dark brown which contrasts with the two bright, broad bands of colour round the body and further coloured bands on the limbs. The first toe is shorter than the second and the toes of males have silver tips. This frog grows to a snout-to-vent length of . It is very similar in appearance to the harlequin poison frog (Oophaga histrionicus), a species with which it can hybridise, and there is ongoing debate as to whether it is in fact a separate species. There are distinct differences in the calls of the males between northern and southern populations. ==Distribution== Lehmann's poison frog is endemic to Colombia where it is found in tropical forests in the drainage of the Anchicay√° River to the west of Dagua in Valle del Cauca Department, as well as in one locality in Choc√≥ Department, all on the slopes of the Cordillera Occidental. Its altitudinal range is . There are several separate populations and the total area of occupancy is less than . ==Biology== Lehmann's poison frog is diurnal and primarily feeds on small insects. It is found on the forest floor and in low vegetation. Breeding takes place at the end of the rainy season. The male chooses a suitable location and calls repeatedly to attract a female. She deposits a small number of large eggs on leaves up to 120 cm (4 ft) above the forest floor where the male fertilises them. He keeps them moist and rotates them occasionally and after two to four weeks he carries them on his back and deposits them singly in small temporary water pools in such places as hollows in trees, water-filled bromeliad rosettes and bamboo stalks. Here the tadpoles develop and the female periodically deposits unfertilised eggs in the water on which they feed. If there are several tadpoles in any water body, cannibalism may occur. In the wild, Lehmann's poison frog is toxic, but in captivity it loses its toxicity because this is derived from its diet. ==Status== Lehmann's poison frog is only found in a very small area of Colombia. It is fully protected in its native country, considered critically endangered by the IUCN and listed on CITES Appendix II. Once a common species in its tiny range, recent surveys have found that it is now very rare. Threats to its survival are the degradation of its habitat due to timber extraction and illegal agriculture, and collection for the pet trade. It is present in the Parque Nacional Natural Farallones de Cali. In an attempt of countering the continued illegal collection of wild individuals, a farm that breeds this species and other Colombian poison frogs in captivity has been started in Colombia, both providing legal frogs for the pet market (instead of illegal wild caught) and an income for the local community. ==References== Category:Oophaga Category:Poison dart frogs Category:Amphibians described in 1976 Category:Amphibians of Colombia Category:Endemic fauna of Colombia Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Lehmann's poison frog"},{"id":"12370820","text":"Bailando! is a special Maxi-Single release by pop singer Gloria Estefan.

As a young physician he studied with Franciscus Cornelis Donders in Utrecht, William Bowman in London, Albrecht von Graefe in Berlin and Hermann von Helmholtz in Heidelberg. From 1860 until 1868 he was a professor of ophthalmology at Heidelberg. He emigrated to New York City, where he worked as a surgeon. In 1869 he founded the New York Ophthalmic and Aural Institute, which from 1913 to 1939 was called the Herman Knapp Memorial Hospital. In 1882, he was made professor of the New York University Medical College. In 1888, he was appointed professor of ophthalmology at the College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, and in 1902 he became emeritus professor. His son, Arnold Knapp (1869‚Äì1956) was also a noted ophthalmologist. The gravesite of Herman Knapp In 1869, with Salomon Moos (1831‚Äì1895), he founded the \\"Archives of Ophthalmology and Otology\\" (Archiv f√ºr Augen- und Ohrenheilkunde), an international scientific monthly journal that was published in Wiesbaden (in German) and New York (in English). In 1878 the archives split into two independent entities; as the \\"Archives of Ophthalmology\\" (Archiv f√ºr Augenheilkunde) and the \\"Journal of Otology\\" (Zeitschrift f√ºr Ohrenheilkunde). His name is lent to the eponymous \\"Knapp streaks\\"; also known as angioid streaks, which are tiny breaks in the elastin- filled tissue in the back of the eye. He devised his own version of an ophthalmotrope, a device used in physiological optics to demonstrate the action of ocular muscles individually or in various combinations.

They are a small green colored frog, approximately 14-16 millimeters in size. Their color is a uniform green with brighter green back and legs, while the ventral side of the frog is metallic. It is endemic to the western slope of the Cordillera Occidental, Colombia. == Habitat and ecology == Its natural habitats are primary lowland and sub-montane forests; it can also been found in good secondary forests. They are found in the forest at a 100 meter to 1300 meter altitude, where bromeliads are located. It is a very rare frog, numbering at fewer than 50, maybe even no individuals. Not seen since 2005, the species was uplisted from \\"Vulnerable\\" to \\"Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct)\\" in 2017. It is one of many organisms that uses the bromeliad plant as its host. The water inside the plant is an essential resource for the green poison frog as well as other organisms. These frogs seek particular characteristics in the plant, like the size of the tank and its water quality. However, due to the frog's specificity, they do not utilize random bromeliads, they must have particular features. == Conservation status and threats == The green poison frog is threatened by habitat loss (deforestation), pollution, invasive and other problematic species, and genes and diseases. Also, certain species of the bromeliad plant are also becoming extinct, similarly to the green poison frog, resulting in co-extinction. Small frogs eat drosophila, micro-crickets, small wax maggots, meadow plankton and spring tails. This species is not recorded in the international pet trade. As far as movement patterns, it is not a migrant. ==References== Category:Andinobates Category:Amphibians of Colombia Category:Endemic fauna of Colombia Category:Amphibians described in 1976 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Andinobates viridis"},{"id":"12370913","text":"Andinobates virolinensis (the Santander poison frog) is a species of frog in the family Dendrobatidae.

Females lay the eggs in leaf-litter, and the males bring the larvae to the bromeliads. Reproduction occurs throughout the year. The diet consists of various arthropods, including mites, springtails, ants, and insect larvae. Thus, their diet is broadly similar to other poison dart frogs. ==Conservation== Andinobates virolinensis is considered \\"Vulnerable\\" by IUCN because it is known from very few locations and because its habitat is threatened by habitat loss, primarily due to agricultural expansion. However, where it occurs it is a common species. Andinobates virolinensis is sometimes found in pet trade, despite the Decree INDERENA No. 39 from July 1985 that forbade the collection of dendrobatids from the wild for breeding (or other) purposes. ==References== Category:Andinobates Category:Amphibians described in 1992 Category:Amphibians of the Andes Category:Amphibians of Colombia Category:Endemic fauna of Colombia Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Andinobates virolinensis"},{"id":"12370916","text":"The La Planada poison frog (Paruwrobates andinus) is a species of frog in the family Dendrobatidae endemic to Colombia.

The species is endemic to Ecuador and Peru. ==Etymology== The specific name, anthonyi, is in honor of American mammalogist Harold Elmer Anthony (1890‚Äì1970), who was Curator of Mammals at the American Museum of Natural History.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2013). The Eponym Dictionary of Amphibians. Exeter, England: Pelagic Publishing Ltd. xiii + 262 pp. . ==Description== Anthony's poison arrow frog has a snout-to-vent length of about . The hind legs are short and robust. The dorsal surface is usually dark red or brown and there are several yellowish- white oblique stripes and a central longitudinal stripe. ==Geographic range== Anthony's poison arrow frog is known only from a number of locations in southwestern Ecuador and northwestern Peru at heights of between above sea level. ==Habitat== The natural habitat of E. anthonyi is the leaf litter on the floor of tropical dry forests, especially near streams. ==Biology== Anthony's poison arrow frog is diurnal and terrestrial. Males are territorial. A clutch of 15 to 40 eggs is laid on the ground among leaf litter, and the male guards them till they hatch in about two weeks. He then carries the tadpoles on his back to a suitable water body where they develop (through metamorphosis) into frogs in about sixty days. Epibatidine, an extremely toxic nicotine-like substance, was first derived from and named for Epipedobates anthonyi. Once investigated for possible use as an analgesic agent, the alkaloid proved far too toxic for any application in human medicine and is presently used exclusively for research purposes. ==Status== Anthony's poison arrow frog is listed as \\"Near Threatened\\" by the IUCN. Its population seems stable but it has a limited range, estimated to be less than , and its habitat is being degraded by pollution from agrochemicals. It is also collected for medicinal use. ==ReferencesFurther reading== *Noble GK (1921). \\"Five new species of Salientia from South America\\". American Museum Novitates (29): 1-7.

Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History, 299, 1-262 formerly Epipedobates silverstonei) is a species of frog in the family Dendrobatidae endemic to Peru. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests and rivers. ==Description== Silverstone's poison frog is a large Dendrobatid frog with males growing to a snout‚Äìvent length of about and females to . The head has a rounded sloping snout and is as wide as the body. Males have a small vocal sac in the throat. The skin of the head, fore limbs and underparts is smooth while that of the dorsal surface and hind limbs is granular. The fingers are flattened and have expanded discs at their tips. There is no webbing between the digits of either hands or feet. The head and back of this frog is orange-red, sometimes with black spots or mottling, especially towards the rear. The hind limbs are largely black and the forelimbs and underparts vary in colour, sometimes being black and sometimes orange. The palms of the hands and feet and the underside of the digits are grey or orange. ==Distribution== Silverstone's poison frog is endemic to Peru. It is found in Cordillera Azul mountain range in Hu√°nuco Department, where it is found at an altitude of about above sea level. Its range is not precisely known and might be wider than is thought. It has also been introduced to the vicinity of Tarapoto in the San Mart√≠n Region but the result of this introduction is unknown. ==Biology== Silverstone's poison frog is a terrestrial species that is found among the leaf litter of the forest floor in tropical montane forests. Males are territorial during the breeding season and call to attract females. The eggs are laid in small clutches of about thirty eggs in a closely packed single layer underneath leaves. The male guards them till they hatch. He then carries them on his back to a suitable ephemeral pool or water-filled crevice where the tadpoles develop until undergoing metamorphosis. The bright colors of this frog probably deter potential predators and this frog is known to be distasteful to snakes. ==References== Category:Ameerega Category:Amphibians of Peru Category:Amphibians described in 1979 Category:Endemic fauna of Peru Category:Endangered animals Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Silverstone's poison frog"},{"id":"12371088","text":"Ameerega trivittata,Grant, T. et al., (2006).

It is found in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Guyana, Peru, Suriname, Venezuela, possibly Ecuador, and possibly French Guiana. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forest floors and intermittent freshwater marshes. A. trivittata is diurnal and terrestrial. Its distinctive features include its large size (up to 50 mm), granular skin, lack of webbing between digits, and distinctive striped markings. The colour of these markings varies; typically the stripes are green, but yellow and orange specimens occur, as well. It lays terrestrial eggs, which are hidden in clutches under leaves. The males take care of the eggs and carry the tadpoles on their backs to pools once they have hatched. It is threatened by habitat loss. ==Description== The male three- striped poison frog has a snout‚Äìvent length of about and the female reaches about . It has a slightly protruding snout with no teeth, finely granulated skin on its dorsal surface and smooth skin on its flanks and ventral surface. The digits are unwebbed and the first finger is longer than the second finger. The colouring of this species varies somewhat between locations but in general it has a black back and sides, a black belly suffused blue posteriorly and yellowish-green or light-brown limbs. Two yellowish-green lateral stripes run from the snout to the hind legs. ==Biology== The three-striped poison frog is a diurnal, terrestrial species that is found among the leaf litter of the forest floor in both primary and secondary tropical forests. The main food of this frog is ants which are plentiful on the forest floor. Males are territorial during the breeding season but females are not. The eggs are laid in small clutches underneath fallen leaves during the rainy season. They take about 15 days to hatch during which time the male guards them. He then carries them to a suitable ephemeral pool or water-filled crevice where the tadpoles develop for from 41 to 54 days before undergoing metamorphosis. ==ReferencesExternal links== trivittata Category:Amphibians of Bolivia Category:Amphibians of Brazil Category:Amphibians of Colombia Category:Amphibians of Guyana Category:Amphibians of Peru Category:Amphibians of Suriname Category:Amphibians of Venezuela Category:Amphibians described in 1824 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Ameerega trivittata"},{"id":"12371095","text":" Ship at Lake Front Airport, New Orleans, Louisiana in July 2010. Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD), Lakehurst, New Jersey, the MZ-3A airship bears the newly adorned insignia of Scientific Development Squadron ONE (VXS-1), and the banner of the U.S. Navy. The American Blimp MZ-3A is a blimp owned by the United States Navy from 2006 to 2017. It is a modified American Blimp Corporation A-170 series commercial blimp and given the USN type/model/series (T/M/S) designation MZ-3A and Bureau Number (BuNo) 167811. After delivery to the Navy, the airship began operations as an advanced flying laboratory used to evaluate affordable sensor payloads, the development of new lighter-than-air (LTA) technologies and general flight support for other related research and development/science and technology (R&D;/S&T;) projects. It was the last airship to be operated by the U. S. military. ==Description== The airship is propeller-driven by two Lycoming engines, providing a maximum cruise speed of just under . The manned 178-foot LTA craft has an operational payload capability of up to and can remain aloft and nearly stationary for more than twelve hours, performing various missions in support of technology development for Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) concepts. ==History== In May 2006, Air Test and Evaluation Squadron TWENTY, Lighter- than-Air Vehicle (LTAV) Detachment (VX-20 LTAV Det) began regular flight operations from Naval Air Engineering Station Lakehurst located in Lakehurst, New Jersey. In 2007 flight operations were halted and the ship stored in Hangar Six at NAES Lakehurst. In October 2009, the MZ-3A was transferred to the United States Naval Research Laboratory Military Support Division's Scientific Development Squadron One (VXS-1), formerly known as the Flight Support Detachment, located at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland.\\"Centennial,\\" Spring 2010, Naval Air Forces Official Publication Vol. 2, Issue 2 In March 2010 the airship resumed flight operations with test flights at Marine Corps Air Station Yuma, Arizona. The MZ-3A is a government owned / contractor operated (GOCO) aircraft operated by a civilian contractor, Integrated Systems Solutions, Inc. (ISSI) of California. ISSI currently maintains and operates the vehicle employing Navy approved, highly qualified, commercial blimp pilots to command the airship. On 5 July 2010, the MZ-3A was re-deployed to the Jack Edwards National Airport in Gulf Shores, Alabama to assist in the Deepwater Horizon oil spill recovery operation. At a ribbon- cutting ceremony on 26 October 2011 at the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, NAES Lakehurst, New Jersey, and in recognition of the Centennial of Naval Aviation, the Navy unveiled a fresh identity for the MZ-3A. Emblazoned with red, white and blue striped rudders reminiscent of the Navy's airships just prior to World War II, the airship also carries the insignia of the VXS-1 Warlocks and the banner of the U.S. Navy. In February 2012, four months after its formal acceptance by the Navy, the MZ-3A airship at Joint Base McGuire- Dix-Lakehurst, New Jersey, it was planned to be deflated and stored, and the program suspended until future missions warranted its re-activation. In March 2012, days after the decision to suspend, the program got a reprieve for at least another 3‚Äì6 months of operations. The MZ-3A was still in operation as of March 2013, providing C4ISR capabilities demonstrations in Florida for U.S. Naval Forces Southern Command/U.S. 4th Fleet. In October 2017, the MZ-3A was sold by the Navy, being purchased by the Florida-based AirSign Airship Group. ==See also== * List of airships of the United States Navy ==NotesReferences== * Navy Lakehurst Historical Society, \\"The Airship,\\" April‚ÄìMay 2007, \\"Navy LATV Unit Honors NLHS, pg 5 * Naval Airship Association, \\"The Noon Balloon\\" Summer 2006, \\"After 44 Years, Lakehurst Back in Lighter-Than-Air Flight Research,\\" posted by the Asbury Park Press, 5 September 2006, by Kirt More, Toms River Bureau, pgs 8‚Äì10. ==External links== * The Noon Balloon (Naval Airship Association) * DoD designation system addendum listing MA-3Z * Local press coverage of start of MZ-3A program Category:2000s United States experimental aircraft Category:Airships of the United States Navy Category:Deepwater Horizon oil spill MZ-3 Category:Twin-engined pusher aircraft Category:Ducted fan-powered aircraft ","title":"American Blimp MZ-3"},{"id":"12371105","text":"WHAW is a Classic Country formatted broadcast radio station licensed to Lost Creek, West Virginia, serving Weston and Lewis County, West Virginia.

Rhodes (September 15, 1915 ‚Äì June 27, 2007) was an American educator and co-founder of a trade school for illustrators and cartoonists that eventually became the School of Visual Arts, one of the premier U.S. colleges for art and design. ==Early life and education == Rhodes was born and raised in the Bronx, New York City. His mother ran a failed wholesale egg business and his father worked for the U.S. Post Office as a postal clerk. Rhodes employed both of his parents in the administrative departments of the School of Visual Arts later in his life. Rhodes received his bachelor's degree from Long Island University. He continued his education and obtained a master's degree and a doctorate from Columbia University. Rhodes wrote his dissertation on poet Robert Burns. He originally intended to become an English teacher, not a cartoonist. == Military service == Rhodes enlisted in the U.S. Army following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. He flew several missions with the Army's 1st Air Commando Group in China, Burma and India. Rhodes obtained a job with the Veterans Administration after World War II. Rhodes, along with illustrator Burne Hogarth, persuaded the VA to support an art school specifically to help veterans returning from the war. The school came to be known as the Cartoonists and Illustrators School, an expansion of Hogarth's Manhattan Academy of Newspaper Art. ==Founding the School of Visual Arts== Rhodes and Hogarth (best known for the comic strip Tarzan) along with James Boyle, founded the Cartoonists and Illustrators School in 1947. Most of the school's initial students were World War II veterans and Hogarth fans who worked during the day and enrolled in night courses. Many of his students had goals of breaking into advertising or publishing. The school was largely financed by the G.I. Bill and started with three faculty, including Rhodes, and 35 students. Rhodes helped to craft a curriculum that emphasized a liberal arts education with humanities courses, as well as the traditional studio arts classes. Rhodes and Hogarth changed the name of the trade school to the School of Visual Arts in 1955. ==McCarthy era== Both Rhodes and Hogarth were summoned to Washington D.C. in 1956 as part of a United States Senate subcommittee investigation of suspected Communists. The Senate subcommittee was specifically trying to investigate whether Communist ideology had infiltrated vocational schools which were financed by the federal government, such as the School of Visual Arts. Rhodes and Hogarth were asked whether they were members of the Communist Party. Both stated to the Senate that they had not been members of the Communist Party since the founding of the school in 1947. However, they invoked the Fifth Amendment when asked about Communist involvement prior to the founding of the school. Senator Joseph McCarthy stated that their refusal to testify proved that both were Communists. Rhodes was quoted as saying to McCarthy, \\"I'll match my record against yours any day in the service. That's a horrible thing to say.\\" McCarthy responded to Rhodes saying, \\"I don't doubt a bit you are a full-fledged Communist.\\" Silas Rhodes' son, David, later told The New York Times that his father had been a member of the Communist Party, but left in 1936, well before his military service in World War II or the founding of the school. The Veterans Administration audited the School of Visual Arts as part of their investigation. The government and the school later settled their grievances. ==Career== Rhodes served as president of the School of Visual Arts for six years. Rhodes guided the school's growth. Under his presidency, the School of Visual Arts became the largest independently run college of art in the country, with nearly 2,700 students, well up from its original 35 students. The school currently enrolls more than 3,300 undergrad and graduate students as of 2007. Rhodes successfully persuaded the New York State Board of Regents to allow the school to confer a bachelor's degree in fine arts in the 1970s. He also worked as a humanities teacher, reflecting his past education at L.I.U. and Columbia University. Rhodes served as the creative director for one of the signature public projects of the School of Visual Arts. He helped advise and create posters designed by the school's faculty which have been displayed on the New York City Subway system for over 50 years. The posters are used to recruit potential students and to promote the School of Visual Arts. Rhodes remained active at the school as the chairman of the board of directors up until his death in 2007. ==Death== Rhodes died in his sleep at age 91 on June 27, 2007 at his home in Katonah, New York. He had spent the entire day working in his office. Rhodes' wife, Beatrice, died in 2002. They had four children, David, Andrew, Steven and Anthony. However, he was survived by only three sons, David, Steven and Anthony and six grandchildren. David Rhodes currently serves as president of the School of Visual Arts, while Anthony P. Rhodes serves as executive vice president.Maimin, Sybil. \\"School of Visual Arts Plans for the Future,\\" Education Update (Nov. 2007). ==QuoteReferencesExternal links== *New York Times: Silas H.

In 1846, he was elected to the Michigan Senate and the following year served as President pro tempore of the State Senate. In 1847, when Governor Alpheus Felch resigned to serve in the U. S. Senate, Bush became the sixth Lieutenant Governor of Michigan serving under Governor William L. Greenly from March 4, 1847 to January 3, 1848. In 1847, he also cast the deciding vote to move the state capital from Detroit to Lansing. Bush soon moved to Lansing and was elected to the state constitutional convention in 1850. Two years later he was a delegate to the 1852 Democratic National Convention, which nominated Franklin Pierce for U. S. President. In 1855 he was elected as state senator from Shiawassee and Ingham counties. He drafted the bill which abolished capital punishment in Michigan.

The ancient site was known in its native language as Ca·∏çÃÅota, and in Chinese during the Han Dynasty as Jingjue (, Old Chinese tseng-dzot, similar to Ca·∏çÃÅota). Numerous ancient archaeological artifacts have been uncovered at the site. Niya was once a major commercial center on an oasis on the southern branch of the Silk Road in the southern Taklamakan Desert. During ancient times camel caravans would cut through, carrying goods from China to Central Asia. ==History== In Hanshu, an independent oasis state called Jingjue, generally thought to be Niya, is mentioned: Niya became part of Loulan Kingdom by the third century. Towards the end of the fourth century it was under Chinese suzerainty. Later it was conquered by Tibet. ==Excavations== Niya site where Aurel Stein found wooden tablets In 1900, Aurel Stein set out on an expedition to western China and the Taklamakan Desert. In Niya he excavated several groups of dwellings, and found 100 wooden tablets written in 105 CE. These tablets bore clay seals, official orders and letters written in Kharoshthi, an early Indic script, dating them to the Kushan empire. Other finds include coins and documents dating from the Han dynasty, Roman coins, an ancient mouse trap, a walking stick, part of a guitar, a bow in working order, a carved stool, an elaborately-designed rug and other textile fragments, as well as many other household objects such as wooden furniture with elaborate carving, pottery, Chinese basketry and lacquer ware. Aurel Stein visited Niya four times between 1901 and 1931. Wooden tablet inscribed with Kharosthi characters Official approval for joint Sino-Japanese archaeological excavations at the site was given in 1994. Researchers have now found remains of human habitation including approximately 100 dwellings, burial areas, sheds for animals, orchards, gardens, and agricultural fields. They have also found in the dwellings well-preserved tools such as iron axes and sickles, wooden clubs, pottery urns and jars of preserved crops. The human remains found there have led to speculation on the origins of these peoples. Some archeological findings from the ruins of Niya are housed in the Tokyo National Museum. Others are part of the Stein collection in the British Museum, the British Library, and the National Museum in New Delhi. Ancient texts showed some king names.

It is also the northernmost parish in the present-day Episcopal Diocese of Southeast Florida. When the church was built the land it is on was in Brevard County. From 1910-25, it was in St. Lucie County. Since 1925 it has been in Martin County. Its rector, W. Frisby Hendricks III recently retired and the parish is starting the search process to call a new rector. In 1963 the church building was moved a few 100 feet to a more prominent place (which now has the address of 2377 N.E. Patrician Street) at the top of Crossroads Hill. A new rectory (now the parish offices) was built on the old location, which now has the address of 2303 N.E. Seaview Drive, which is the church's mailing address. Since being moved, the church building has been added onto twice but care was taken to preserve its architectural integrity.

Later the same day he walked down to Jensen and preached in the parlor of the Al Fresco Hotel. That simple beginning resulted in the formation of two parishes: St. Paul's in Walton north of Eden and All Saints' in Waveland south of Jensen.Thurlow, Sandra Henderson Historic Jensen and Eden on Florida's Indian River (2004) Stuart: Sewall's Point Company, pp. 166-167 ==All Saints Cemetery== New mausoleum under construction. Existing ones are to the left (shown) and behind (hidden). Dedication of Serenity Garden, July 29, 2012 All Saints Cemetery, sometimes called Waveland Cemetery or All Saints Waveland Cemetery, is the only cemetery in Jensen Beach and is non-profit. Although the cemetery is affiliated with All Saints Church, it is non-sectarian and serves as the community's cemetery. Old section The old section runs from Dixie Highway, S.R. 707, west up the hill to the church property. Upright markers range from plain wooden ones (which are no longer legible) to elaborate granite and marble ones. New section The much larger new section abuts both the old section and the church property on their north sides and runs from Dixie Highway up and over the hill to the Florida East Coast Railway tracks. Until recently it was a lawn area and only allowed stone or bronze markers which are flush with the ground. Several upright markers have been permitted recently in this area. Mausoleums, cremation section and Serenity Gardens Since the land in both the old and new sections that lies between the foot of the hill and Dixie Highway is too low for standard in-ground burials, it is now being used for three mausoleums, a cremation section and the new Serenity Gardens, which is also for cremated remains. ==Alleluia Cross and Outdoor Altar== Alleluia Cross and Outdoor Altar The Georgia granite Alleluia Cross and Outdoor Altar are located 65 feet east of the eastern wall of the church on the west side of the parking lot overlooking the cemetery and Dixie Highway below and the Indian River to the east. They were given by Wallace E. Conkling (1896‚Äì1979), retired bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Chicago, in memory of his wife, Constance Lillian (Sowby) Conkling, who died on March 9, 1969, and whose ashes were interred beneath the altar. The east side of the cross is inscribed vertically \\"ALLELUIA\\", while the west side is inscribed \\"JESU MERCI.\\" Bishop Conkling was bishop in residence at All Saints' for many years and after he died on August 27, 1979, his ashes were also interred under the outdoor altar. The base of the cross is inscribed on the west side: \\"Wallace Edmonds Conkling / The Bishop of Chicago / 1941-53 / August 27, 1979 / Constance Sowby Conkling / his wife / March 9, 1969.\\" The Diocese of Chicago gave money to All Saints' to provide for the care of Bishop Conkling's grave. The parish's Easter Sunrise Services are held there each year. Other services such as the Blessing of the Animals are also held there from time to time. The cross itself has a twin in the cemetery of St. Gregory's Abbey, Three Rivers, Michigan. ==See also== *Episcopal Diocese of South Florida, All Saints' original diocese ==Resources== *Thurlow, Sandra Henderson, Historic Eden and Jensen on Florida's Indian River (2004) Stuart: Sewall's Point Company, ==ReferencesExternal links== *All Saints' Episcopal Church website * All Saints Cemetery at Find A Grave *Martin County Genealogical Society Cemetery Project: All Saints Cemetery *List of Inscriptions in Old Section of Cemetery, compiled by Myrtle M.

He attended the Royal Grammar School, High Wycombe, and Magdalen College School, Oxford. A gifted salesman, Montague founded Gatehill Beco in 1958 aged 26 on an investment of ¬£100, selling electric wire and later making cheap electric boiling rings: \\"I used to make the goods, sell them, deliver them to the back door, and then go round to the front to collect the money.\\" After he received a large order he could not fulfil himself, Montague sought out a large corporate, and eventually sold out to Valor in 1962, of which he then became a Director and then managing director. Montague diversified the company through both product innovation and export driven expansion, visiting even the underdeveloped markets of Africa, Asia and Japan personally at least once a year. In 1969 he was made chair of the Asia committee of the British National Export Council, where he served until 1972, as a result of which he was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1970 Birthday Honours. Montague expanded Valor, when in 1987 Valor paid ¬£263m for Yale locks and NuTone. In August 1989 Ingersoll Rand sold its 2.2% holding in Yale & Valor to Williams Holdings, which thereby took its stake to 5.8%. In January 1991 Williams Holdings paid ¬£330m for Yale & Valor, and Montague left the company. The Valor brand is now owned by Glen Dimplex, and the Yale Lock Company is now a subsidiary of Assa Abloy. Other interests Montague used his money to invest in other business, including the fledgling Planet Hollywood and Ramada Jarvis Hotels. Montague also expanded his public duties, and was Governor and Chairman of the Audit Commission at Oxford Brookes University. As chair of the English Tourist Board he made attacks on: second- rate hoteliers; greedy seaside impresarios; grubby motorway caterers; miserable museum attendants; surly waiters; and taxi drivers ‚Äì whom he accused of cadging large tips out of unsuspecting tourists. When latterly as chair of the National Consumer Council, he told the public to boycott places offering poor value for money. A keen supporter of the Arts, among other activities he sponsored the Oxford Festival and was chair of the Henley Festival from 1992 to 1994. Politics After the 1964 general election, Montague said in an open letter to the press that he \\"deplored the way the Conservatives had attacked the newly elected Labour government as bad for British business, given that as a businessman I have suffered from the results of bad economic management of the past few years\\". A good friend of Labour party leader John Smith and Peter Mandelson, Montague was a member of the Millennium Commission from February 1994 until May 1997 Continuing his friendship of the Labour party via Mandelson with new leader Tony Blair, he was created a life peer on 1 November 1997 taking the title Baron Montague of Oxford, of Oxford in the County of Oxfordshire. It later emerged that this was after he had made a donation of ¬£5,000 to the Labour party. Montague collapsed while attending the House of Lords on 5 November 1999. He was pronounced dead in the ambulance on the way to St Thomas' Hospital. After death In February 2000, openly gay Lord Alli raised the issue of Montague's Japanese partner of 35 years, Takashi Sizuki, having to sell their home in Dorchester-on-Thames to pay the Inheritance tax. At the time, Inheritance tax was charged at 40 per cent on the excess value of estates valued at ¬£231,000 and above, but there was an exemption for estates inherited by the surviving partner of a married couple. It was part of Alli's campaign that resulted in the laws which created Civil partnerships in the United Kingdom. ==ArmsReferencesExternal links== * Obituary at The Independent Category:People educated at the Royal Grammar School, High Wycombe Category:People educated at Magdalen College School, Oxford Category:English businesspeople Category:LGBT businesspeople from the United Kingdom Category:People associated with Oxford Brookes University Category:Gay politicians Category:Commanders of the Order of the British Empire Category:Labour Party (UK) life peers Category:Life peers created by Elizabeth II Category:1932 births Category:1999 deaths Category:LGBT politicians from England Category:LGBT life peers ","title":"Michael Montague, Baron Montague of Oxford"},{"id":"12371285","text":"Michael Montague may refer to: * Michael Montague, Baron Montague of Oxford (1932‚Äì1999), British businessman and politician * Michael Montague (priest) (1773‚Äì1845), Irish priest and educator ","title":"Michael Montague"},{"id":"12371358","text":"The Disappearance of Subramaniam Ramachandran is an incident that took place against a Tamil journalist in Sri Lanka. ==Background== This incident is part of acts of violence and intimidation against journalists and human rights activists taking place in areas controlled by the Sri Lankan government.

Mannophryne venezuelensis from the Paria Peninsula in Venezuela were formerly included in this species. ==Description== Male Mannophryne trinitatis grow to a snout‚Äìvent length of about and females to . Tadpoles are initially in length and up to about when metamorphosing. Adult males have a grey throat whereas females have a bright yellow throat (hence the name \\"yellow-throated frog\\"). The colouration is cryptic; the dorsal surface is brown while the flanks are dark or mottled. Diet Adults feed on small insects (e.g., Drosophila) and other arthropods. Tadpoles are herbivorous, feeding on algae and leaf litter. Reproduction Female Mannophryne trinitatis maintain small (up to 1 m¬≤) territories that they defend against both males and other females. Males court females from a distance using their vocalizations and colour (changing from pale brown to black when calling). If the female is receptive, she leaves the territory and approaches the calling male. The pair then moves to oviposition sites (e.g., a rock crevice or leaves). Clutch size is about 2‚Äì12 eggs measuring in diameter. The males tend the eggs until they hatch after about 21 days, and then carries the tadpoles to pools with slow flow rates, sometimes wet leaf litter when suitable pools are not available. Males generally avoid pools with the predators Anablepsoides hartii or Macrobrachium carcinus and may carry the tadpoles for long distance in order to find a suitable pool. It takes about 56 days for the tadpoles to reach metamorphosis. While males may carry the tadpoles for up to four days, this seems not incur significant costs in terms of reduced feeding, fat loss, or locomotion (jump length and number). ==Distribution, habitat, and conservation== The frog is found within the Northern and the Central Ranges. They are found along densely shaded, narrow, shallow, slow-flowing, clear water streams in undisturbed moist montane forest. The frog is listed on the IUCN Red List as \\"vulnerable\\", being locally threatened by pollution, habitat loss and habitat degradation.

The hosts, Jason Chambers and Bill Duff, traveled across the world studying the unique martial arts, or styles of fighting, that have origins in the region. Each episode usually consisted of a brief introduction regarding the featured martial art, including footage of established fighters sparring. The hosts would then travel to various locations, learning several strikes, blocks, or other techniques valuable to the particular art from various instructors and/or masters. Along the way, they learned about the origins and cultural history of each fighting style. To help the viewer understand the moves the hosts learn, each technique was visually broken down with a motion capture element. Creator Terry Bullman also acted as stuntman for motion capture. After practicing featured aspects of the art, the hosts typically assessed the various skills and their effectiveness. At the end of each episode, one of the hosts would fight a representative of the episode's fighting style. The show is similar to a later program called \\"Fight Quest\\".

It is found on the Caribbean versant of Central America from southeastern Nicaragua through Costa Rica to northwestern Panama, with one record just west of the Panama Canal. Populations from the Pacific versant, formerly included in this species, are now identified as Phyllobates vittatus. Distribution of Phyllobates lugubris ==Description== Adult males measure and females in snout‚Äìvent length. Maxillary teeth are present. The dorsum is black with a pair of dorsolateral stripes, typically pale yellow to gold or orange, running along the sides of the dorsum from near the hindlimbs to the snout. The limbs are usually mottled with yellow‚Äìgreenish yellow. The ventral surfaces are mottled with extensive black pigment, often to an extent that gives nearly solid black appearance. ==Habitat and conservation== Phyllobates lugubris inhabits humid lowland forests (marginally the premontane forests) at elevations of above sea level. It can also occur in secondary growth and plantations. It is diurnal and terrestrial. Adult frogs are often found by rocky sections of forest streams. Eggs are laid in dry leaf-litter. The hatching tadpoles are transported by males to forest streams to complete the larval development. General habitat loss and pollution are potential threats to this species. Chytrid fungos Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis has been detected in museum specimens but its impact on natural populations is unknown.

While it is only the fourth-most toxic of the genus, the Golfodulcean poison frog is still a highly toxic animal. Its poison causes severe pain, followed by tonic-clonic seizures and paralysis if a large enough dose of the toxin is administered. The frog, for protection, advertises its toxin with its multi- coloured body. Because it is of comparatively large size for a poison dart frog, the Golfodulcean poison frog can store a large amount of poison in its skin. Captive examples lack the toxin, which suggests they do not manufacture the poison themselves, but instead acquire it from a species of insect or other small invertebrate on which they feed. Scientists have not determined the batrachotoxin source for any species of the genus Phyllobates, although toxic birds from New Guinea likely get batrachotoxin from a small beetle of the family Melyridae. == Description == P. vittatus is a fairly large poison frog, reaching a length of 3.5 cm in adulthood, with females typically being larger than males. They are more smooth-bodied than other species of the genus, having almost perfectly sloping backs. Unlike the related P. bicolor and P. terribilis, their shoulder blades are usually not visible beneath their skin, giving the frogs the appearance of being overweight. The frog's color is black, but it may appear to glitter due to chemical pigments in the skin. Its legs are mottled blue, and the sides often have a marble pattern of blue or green. One of the most distinctive features of P. vittatus are the two stripes running down its back for which it was named. These stripes are usually fire orange, but they may also be golden, yellow, or green, and extend from just above the cloaca to the end of the frog's nose. ==Habitats== Its natural habitats are primary lowland moist and wet forests at elevations of above sea level. It is diurnal and terrestrial species associated with streams. Eggs are usually laid on leaves above the ground. The hatching tadpoles are transported by males to forest streams where they complete the larval development. == As pets == Golfodulcean poison frogs are communal animals, and have recently become available in the pet trade. They can be kept in a vivarium measuring about 100x60x60 cm, to grant the frogs both space to move around on the ground and space to climb. A clean, mossy substrate should be provided and, optionally, a carpet of leaves. However, care must be taken to ensure that the leaves are completely unblemished, as many parasitic fungi are lethal to amphibians. Phyllobates frogs climb by sticking to leaves with their adhesive toe pads, in a similar manner to geckos, and the climbing space must be smooth and vertical. Phyllobates frogs are more than capable of climbing out of unsecured vivaria, so their vivaria must be completely sealed. == References == Category:Phyllobates Category:Endemic fauna of Costa Rica Category:Amphibians of Costa Rica Category:Taxa named by Edward Drinker Cope Category:Amphibians described in 1893 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Golfodulcean poison frog"},{"id":"12371499","text":"Randy Holden (born July 2, 1945) is an American guitarist best known for his involvement with the West Coast acid rock group Blue Cheer on their third album, New! Improved! (1969). Additionally, he is a painter. His album Population II from 1970 is considered to be one of the earliest examples of doom metal. ==Biography== Randy Holden was born in Pennsylvania and grew up on the move. He played in a number of bands including the Iridescents (blues rock), the Fender IV (surf rock) and the Sons of Adam (surf rock/psychedelic rock). Holden relocated the Fender IV from Baltimore, Maryland, to Southern California and they eventually became the Sons of Adam. While playing in the Sons of Adam Holden opened for the Rolling Stones at their first show at the Long Beach Sports Arena. Holden was heavily influenced by Keith Richards' guitar and amp set up which helped change his own attitude towards equipment and tone. The Sons of Adam (specifically Holden) began experimenting with distortion and feedback which pushed into psychedelic rock. Holden left the band frustrated with the lack of original material. Holden joined the Other Half, a psychedelic garage band from Los Angeles. In 1968, they recorded an album, but Holden soon left and replaced Leigh Stephens in Blue Cheer. He toured with them for a year and contributed three songs for the album New! Improved! Blue Cheer (1969). He is credited with the songwriting, vocal, and guitars for \\"Peace of Mind\\", \\"Fruits & Icebergs\\", and \\"Honey Butter Love\\". However, he left the group during the recording sessions and the rest of the album was recorded with other musicians. Frustrated with lack of control over the bands, Randy formed his next new band with drummer Chris Lockheed. Lockheed, also a keyboard player, uniquely played both drums and keyboard simultaneously in live performances. During this time Holden obtained a sponsorship deal with Sunn amplifiers. Through this, he received his legendary sixteen 200 Watt amplifiers. His new band was dubbed \\"Randy Holden - Population II\\" which was a reference to the fact there were only two members in the band as well as being an astronomical term \\"Population II\\" that defines a special kind of Star Group cluster type, having Heavy Metal in its composition. An appropriate description of the original style of the music attributed to Holden's new band. The band recorded its only album, Population II (1970). Trouble with the release of the album led to Holden going bankrupt, losing all his equipment and his departure from music for over two decades. Population II was eventually released multiple times in bootleg forms over the years, with no official re-release until a limited issue in LP in 2005 and finally a remastered CD in 2008. The album has become a much-sought-after collectors' item over the years. After more than two decades he returned to his guitar, and began creating music again, reportedly at the continual urging of a loyal fan. He recorded Guitar God in 1994 and released Guitar God 2001 in 2001, followed in 2008 with the release of \\"Raptor\\". In 2008 Richie Unterberger said \\"He's a good candidate for selection as the great unknown 1960s rock guitar hero. No other American guitarist was as skilled at creating the kind of sustain-heavy, snaky guitar lines pioneered by Jeff Beck in the Yardbirds. His recordings with the Fender IV, Sons of Adam, Ugly Things, The Other Half, and Blue Cheer, as well as his solo recordings, don't only contain some feverishly innovative playing. They also chart the overall rainbow of changes undergone by California 1960s rock guitar as a whole, from surf to pseudo-Merseybeat to psychedelia, hard rock and heavy metal.\\"Richie Unterberger, Urban Spacemen and Wayfaring Strangers: Overlooked Innovators and Eccentric Visionaries of '60s Rock.

It is typically found in open habitats such as meadows and open oak forests. Habitat loss is one of the threats to its survival. ==Description== The Iberian midwife toad grows to a length of about , males being rather smaller than females. The snout is rounded and the eyes large, with vertical slit pupils. There are tiny, often orange, warts on the upper eyelids. The parotoid glands are relatively small and the tympani distinct. There are many tubercles on the body and concentrations of glandular warts under the arms, in the groin area and on the ankles. The limbs are fairly short. The colour of the upper surface is brownish-grey with dark spots, and the warts are often reddish. The underparts are unspotted and greyish-white. ==Distribution and habitat== This toad is native to Portugal and western Spain at altitudes of up to above sea level. Its preferred habitat is Mediterranean-type scrub, rough grazing and light oak woodland. ==Biology== Mating takes place in the autumn and the eggs are laid on land. The male then gathers up the egg mass and wraps it round his legs, carrying it around until the developing embryos are ready to hatch. He can carry as many as 180 eggs resulting from four clutches laid by different females. The male deposits the hatching tadpoles in suitable water bodies where they continue their development. Metamorphosis occurs about four months later when the tadpoles measure about in length. ==Status== The IUCN lists this species as being \\"Near Threatened\\". The main threats it faces are the degradation of suitable terrestrial habitat, pollution and loss of suitable breeding pools, and the introduction of the invasive crayfish Procambarus clarkii and non-native fishes which prey on the tadpoles. It is also threatened by the infectious fungal disease chytridiomycosis. ==ReferencesExternal links== * * Category:Alytes Category:Amphibians described in 1879 Category:Endemic amphibians of the Iberian Peninsula Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Iberian midwife toad"},{"id":"12371583","text":"The Betic midwife toad or Sapo Partero B√©tico (Alytes dickhilleni) is a species of frog in the family Alytidae (formerly Discoglossidae). It is endemic to mountainous in south eastern Spain. Its natural habitats are temperate forests, freshwater marshes, intermittent freshwater marshes, pastureland, ponds, and aquaculture ponds. It is threatened by habitat loss. ==Description== The Betic midwife toad is grey, finely mottled with dark and pale specks. Its length may be about and it has bulging eyes with vertical slit pupils. There is a distinctive grey area between the eyes and the parotoid glands are relatively small. There is a lateral line of whitish glandular tubercles on the body but an absence of the orange glandular spots found in other members of the genus. ==Distribution and habitat== The Betic midwife toad is native to the Sierra Nevada Mountains in south eastern Spain. The population is fragmented as different mountains support separate populations. It is fairly common on Alcaraz, Segura and Cazorla Mountains but less common on the drier Filabres, Baza and G√°dor peaks. It is generally found in oak and pine forests and in open rocky areas, mostly on limestone, at altitudes between . In drier parts it tends to be near springs. ==Biology== The Betic midwife toad is nocturnal and hides under rocks and in crevices during the day. The toads mate on land and the male coils the egg mass round his hind legs and carries it around until the developing tadpoles are ready to hatch. He then deposits them in suitable water bodies such as mountain streams, cattle troughs and reservoirs. The tadpoles are slow-growing and may overwinter before undergoing metamorphosis into juvenile frogs. ==Status== The IUCN lists this toad as \\"Vulnerable\\" as its numbers appear to be in decline. The main threats it faces are the diminution in the number of suitable breeding sites due to drought, water abstraction and changes in agricultural practices. It is also at risk from the fungal disease chytridiomycosis.

It would repeal the corporate tax and payroll taxes (including Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax (FICA)). All income, from whatever source, would be taxed the same (i.e., whether income from wages, dividends, interest or capital gains). The plan was proposed by Hayden Kepner of the law firm Arnall Golden Gregory. Kepner states that such a tax system would be transparent, easily understandable, could fit on a post-card, and everyone who earns an income would pay taxes. The plan would expand the tax base and he suggests that it would have an incentive to keep federal spending at modest levels (under our current system, approximately 50% pay no income taxes and may not have the incentive to try to keep federal spending in control). The personal income tax would be made up of three progressive rates: 15%, 25%, and 35% (locked together to prevent raising of one rate without raising the others). The estate tax would apply an annual wealth tax of 1-2%, which would be similar to property taxes currently administered at the state level, but would include all property (i.e., stocks, bonds, real property) above a threshold amount. ==Predicted effects== Tax burden visibility Supporters assert that the proposal would make the cost of federal government visible. Under the current tax system, the federal government collects revenue through a wide variety of taxes on individuals and businesses. Thus the cost of government is spread out among many different avenues and may not be fully visible to individual citizens. For example, corporate taxes and compliance costs are passed partially from producers to final consumers when producers include those costs in the retail price of goods and services. Proponents claim that the Kepner income tax would reduce the \\"K Street tax lobbyist's\\" ability to influence legislators to manipulate the U.S. tax code for the benefit of their clients. The plan does not prevent future changes by Congress; however, due to the transparency of the tax, the American people would be aware of changes to the tax base from exemptions because a change in tax rate would likely be reflected. Politicians would have to justify to the American people any tax increase or decrease. In addition, the Kepner tax would remove the use of tax exemptions for corporate welfare. Effect on international business locality Global corporations consider local tax structures when making planning and capital investment decisions. Lower corporate tax rates and favorable transfer pricing regulations can induce higher corporate investment in a given locality. Such investment translates into higher economic growth. Ireland's real GDP growth was almost three times higher than the European Union average between 1991 and 2000. During the decade, Ireland taxed corporate profits from manufacturing at 10%, the lowest in the EU. The United States currently has the highest combined statutory corporate income tax rate among OECD countries. The Kepner tax would eliminate the corporate income tax, which supporters argue would make the United States a tax haven and boost the economy. ==Critique== Critics claim that the Kepner Income Tax system could penalize work and discourage saving and investment. Phil Hinson stated that the Kepner tax would provide many benefits over the current system; however, Hinson argued that the tax rates would need to be higher than the FairTax proposal (often criticized by Kepner), that special interests would manipulate the tax, and that no formal proposal or research exists. The principles of an income tax are also argued by critics. Frank Chodorov wrote \\"... you come up with the fact that it gives the government a prior lien on all the property produced by its subjects.\\" The government \\"unashamedly proclaims the doctrine of collectivized wealth. ...

It is found in Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom (although, in the latter, only as an introduction). Like other members of its genus (Alytes), the male toad carries the eggs around entwined on his back and thighs until they are ready to hatch.Alytidae AmphibiaWeb. Retrieved 2012-03-26. Its natural habitats are temperate forests, dry forests, shrubland, rivers, freshwater lakes, freshwater marshes, temperate desert, arable land, pastureland and urban areas. It is threatened by habitat loss. ==Description== The common midwife toad can grow to a length of but is usually rather smaller than this, the females generally being larger than the males. It is broad and stocky and has a large head with prominent eyes, the pupils being vertical slits. The skin is mostly smooth with a few small warts and granules and a row of large warts down either side. The parotoid glands are small and there are additional glands in the under arm and ankle regions. There are three tubercles on each metacarpal. The colour is quite variable, often being grey, olive or brown, sometimes speckled with small greenish or brown spots. The large warts are often reddish or yellow. The underside is pale grey often with spots of darker grey on the throat and chest. ==Distribution and habitat== The common midwife toad is found in a number of countries in north west Europe. It is common throughout France and is also found in southern Belgium and the Netherlands, Luxembourg, western Germany and northern and western Switzerland. There are some disconnected outlying populations in Portugal and northern Spain. In the Pyrenees it is found at altitudes of up to . It is usually found not far from water but sometimes wanders away, often living in sunny locations. These include hilly areas, cultivated land, quarries, rocky slopes, gravel pits, woods, parks and gardens. It is active at dusk and through the night, spending the day hidden in undergrowth, in crevices or under logs or stones in a place where it can keep damp. It can dig a burrow with its fore limbs in which to lie and spends the winter hibernating on land. ==Behaviour== Calling individual When threatened, the midwife toad inflates itself, filling itself with air so as to make it appear as large as possible. It may also rear up on all four limbs, raise its rump and stand in a threatening posture with its head down and eyes shut. Reproduction takes place in spring and summer. The female seeks out a male and invites him to mate. Females are more prone to selecting larger males due to fitness preference. He proceeds to hold her round the flanks and uses his toes to stimulate her cloaca. After about half an hour he squeezes her sides firmly and she stretches her hind legs and ejects a mass of eggs embedded in strings of jelly. The male releases her and inseminates the egg mass with his sperm. A little later, he begins to pull and pummel the egg mass, teasing it out so that he can wrap the strings around his back legs. He can mate again while the eggs are twined round his limbs and can carry up to three clutches of eggs at a time, a total of about 150 eggs. He looks after them until they hatch in 3 to 8 weeks time. He keeps them moist by lying up in a damp place during the day and by going for a swim if they are in danger of drying out. He may secrete a substance through his skin that protects them from infection. When the eggs are about to hatch, he finds a suitable stretch of water and releases them. He chooses cool, calm water such as a ditch, village pond, spring or drinking trough. The eggs hatch into tadpoles which feed and grow over the course of several months, develop limbs, lose their tails and eventually undergo metamorphosis, becoming juvenile toads. They may overwinter as tadpoles, becoming exceptionally large in the process. ==Role in history of biology, sociology of science== The 1971 book by Arthur Koestler The Case of the Midwife Toad, brought the species a role in new thinking on the development of scientific paradigms based on the case of Paul Kammerer who claimed to have shown Lamarckian inheritance in experiments with the toad. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Sound recordings of Common midwife toad at BioAcoustica * * Category:Alytes Category:Amphibians described in 1768 Category:Amphibians of Europe Category:Articles containing video clips Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Common midwife toad"},{"id":"12371613","text":"The Iberian painted frog (Discoglossus galganoi, in Spanish sapillo pintojo ib√©rico) is a species of frog in the family Alytidae (formerly Discoglossidae). It is found in Portugal and Spain, where its natural habitats are temperate forests, temperate shrubland, Mediterranean-type shrubby vegetation, rivers, intermittent rivers, swamps, freshwater marshes, intermittent freshwater marshes, sandy shores, arable land and grassland. It is threatened by habitat loss. ==Description== This small frog has a broad head and stout body. It usually has longitudinal rows of warts on its back, but these are not present in all individuals. The pupil of the eye is said to resemble an \\"upside-down droplet\\". This frog comes in three different coloured forms; a plain shade of greyish-brown, a pattern of large dark spots with pale rims; and a dorsal and two lateral bright bands on a dark background. ==Distribution and habitat== The Iberian painted frog is endemic to Spain and Portugal. It occurs at altitudes of up to and its typical habitats include open areas, rough grassland, thickets, woodland verges, swamps and gulleys, usually in or near water. ==Biology== The breeding period usually lasts from October to December. Females mate several times and can produce as many as 5,000 eggs in several clutches during the season. The eggs are laid in water either singly or in small groups, on the bottom or attached to plants. They hatch after two to six days according to the temperature. The tadpoles undergo metamorphosis after between twenty-two and sixty days of development and the juveniles are about one centimetre (0.4 in) long when they leave the water. ==Status== The Iberian painted frog is listed by the IUCN as being of \\"Least Concern\\". It is common over most of its range and the number of individuals may be declining slowly but the rate of loss is not sufficient to justify placing it in a more threatened category. ==References== Category:Discoglossus Category:Amphibians described in 1985 Category:Endemic amphibians of the Iberian Peninsula Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Iberian painted frog"},{"id":"12371628","text":"The Spanish painted frog (Discoglossus jeanneae, in Spanish sapillo pintojo meridional) is a species of frog in the family Alytidae (formerly Discoglossidae). It is endemic to Spain. ==Description== The Spanish painted frog is a medium-sized amphibian. The top of the frog is predominantly colored with dark browns in the form of spots or stripes, and its underbelly is usually white or yellow. The males will have webbing between their hind toes, but the webbing will not be found in females or adolescent males. During the mating season, the males will develop black calluses on the toe webbing, throat, belly and parts of the forefeet. This species is very closely related to the Iberian painted frog, but they differ in a couple of significant ways. The Spanish painted frog has a shorter snout and smaller forefeet than its Iberian counterpart. ==Distribution and habitat== The Spanish painted frog is endemic to the southern, eastern and north-eastern regions of Spain, but is more densely populated in the southern regions. It mostly lives in open areas, pine groves and shrublands from sea level to roughly 2,000 meters. ==Biology== Not much is known about the biology of the Spanish painted frog, but it is believed to be very similar to that of the Iberian painted frog. It is believed to be active year-round. Eggs are usually laid in small, shallow bodies of water. Its diet consists mostly of insects and worms, though they have also been known to eat the young of other frogs and toads. Most activity is done at night. The tadpoles eat plant material. ==Status== The Spanish painted frog is classified as Near Threatened (NT) according to the IUCN Red List, and results from a series of droughts throughout most of its range. There is a high probability that isolated populations have become extinct along the Mediterranean coast. ==References== Category:Discoglossus Category:Endemic amphibians of the Iberian Peninsula Category:Endemic fauna of Spain Category:Amphibians described in 1986 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Spanish painted frog"},{"id":"12371637","text":"The Corsican painted frog (Discoglossus montalentii) is a species of frogs in the family Alytidae (formerly Discoglossidae).

It's part of the Fair Youth sequence, and the seventh sonnet of the Rival Poet group. ==Exegesis== This poem extends the debate of the Rival Poet group of sonnets: Is the young man praised best in the simple, true and straightforward manner of the speaker, or in the more rhetorically flamboyant style of other poets? The first quatrain asks: Which of the poets can say more to the young man than ‚ÄúYou are uniquely you? Inside of you is stored all that can offer the example (or simile) worthy (or equal) of you?‚Äù The suggestion is that there is no simile worthy, and without a simile or metaphor there will be no poetry. The second quatrain says that it is an impoverished pen that cannot write something to add some glory to his subject, but in the youth's case all that writer needs to do is simply describe the youth. Just copy, don't make it worse, and the writer will become famous for his wit. The couplet points out that the desire the youth has for flattery hurts the praise he receives, because that praise is not the simple, and ideal description ‚Äî it is mere flattery. This is an idea that sounds like the problem Cordelia has in King Lear: Whatever she can say about her father, he wants flattery, and she cannot satisfy that desire.Shakespeare, William.

It follows the rhyme scheme ABAB CDCD EFEF GG and is composed in iambic pentameter, a metre of five feet per line, with two syllables in each foot accented weak/strong. Most of the lines are examples of regular iambic pentameter, including the 11th line: √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / And such a counterpart shall fame his wit Line 12 has a variation in the first foot ‚Äì a reversal of the accent: / √ó √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / Making his style admired every where.

The meter calls for a few variant pronunciations: line 3's \\"confine\\" may be stressed on the second syllable (even though a noun) and \\"immur√®d\\" needs to be pronounced with 3 syllables; while line 13's \\"beauteous\\" is pronounced with only 2 syllables and line 14's \\"being\\" only 1. ==NotesReferences== Category:British poems Category:Sonnets by William Shakespeare ","title":"Sonnet 84"},{"id":"12371652","text":"Discoglossus scovazzi (common name: Moroccan painted frog, in French discoglosse peint or discoglosse √† ventre blanc) is a species of frog in the family Alytidae.Formerly Discoglossidae, see It is found in Morocco as well as in the Spanish North African enclaves Ceuta and Melilla. ==Habitat== Discoglossus scovazzi lives near streams, cisterns and pools of either fresh or saline water, often in Quercus forest, Nerium oleander scrub, or near ruins.

Published quarterly by the Print Mint, it ran for seven issues between 1975 and 1976. Arriving late in the underground era, Arcade \\"was conceived as a 'comics magazine for adults' that would showcase the 'best of the old and the best of the new comics.'\\"Fox, M. Steven. \\"Arcade, The Comics Revue,\\" ComixJoint. Accessed June 19, 2018. Many observers credit it with paving the way for the Spiegelman-edited anthology Raw, the flagship publication of the 1980s alternative comics movement. Well-known creators who contributed to the anthology include R. Crumb, Kim Deitch, Jay Kinney, Aline Kominsky, Jay Lynch, Spain Rodriguez, Gilbert Shelton and S. Clay Wilson. == Overview == By the mid-1970s, the underground comix movement was encountering a slowdown, and Spiegelman and Griffith conceived of Arcade as a \\"safe berth.\\" It stood out from similar publications by having an ambitious editorial plan, in which Spiegelman and Griffith attempted to show how comics connected to the broader realms of artistic and literary culture.Grishakova, Marina; Ryan, Marie-Laure (2010). Intermediality and Storytelling. Walter de Gruyter. ,pp=67‚Äì68. Arcade also introduced comic strips from ages past, as well as contemporary literary pieces by writers such as William S. Burroughs and Charles Bukowski,Buhle, Paul (2004). From the Lower East Side to Hollywood: Jews in American Popular Culture. Verso. , p. 252. and illustrated nonfiction pieces by writers like Paul Krassner and J. Hoberman. == Publication history == Spiegelman and Griffith, based in the San Francisco Bay Area ‚Äî the epicenter of the underground movementLopes, Paul. Demanding Respect: The Evolution of the American Comic Book (Temple University Press, 2009), p. 77. ‚Äî launched Arcade in Spring 1975. Soon after, however, co-editor Spiegelman moved back to his original home of New York City,Witek, Joseph, ed. (2007). \\"Chronology\\". Art Spiegelman: Conversations. University Press of Mississippi. pp. xvii‚Äìxiii. , p. xix. which put most of the editorial work for Arcade on the shoulders of Griffith and his cartoonist wife, Diane Noomin. This, combined with distribution problems, retailer indifference, and a general failure to find a devoted audience, led to the magazine's 1976 demise. == Contributors == Contributors to every issue of Arcade included Spiegelman, Griffith, Robert Armstrong, Robert Crumb, Justin Green, Aline Kominsky, Michael McMillan, Diane Noomin, and Spain Rodriguez. Crumb illustrated five of the seven front covers. Each issue contained a reprint of work by a cartoonist from the medium's Golden Age, including H. M. Bateman, Harrison Cady, Billy DeBeck, Milt Gross, and George McManus. Each issue's title page contained individual self- portraits by the contributors. == Issue guide == {  - ! # !! Date !!

Famed comics writer Alan Moore said it was \\"the only truly worthwhile material produced during the 1970s.\\" With the general waning of the underground scene, however, Spiegelman despaired that comics for adults might fade away for good. Frustrated with editing his peers because of the tension and jealousies involved, for a time Spiegelman swore he would never edit another magazine.Kaplan, Arie (2006). \\"Art Spiegelman\\". Masters of the Comic Book Universe Revealed!. Chicago Review Press. pp. 99‚Äì124. , p. 108. Nonetheless, by 1980, Spiegelman and his wife/collaborator Fran√ßoise Mouly launched Raw, a \\"graphix magazine,\\" hoping their unprecedented approach would bypass readers' prejudices against comics and force them to look at the work with new eyes. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Masters of American Comics by John Carlin, Paul Karasik, Brian Walker and Stanley Crouch * Some information about the book Masters of American Comics * Category:1975 comics debuts Category:Comics magazines published in the United States Category:1976 comics endings Category:Underground comix Category:Magazines established in 1975 Category:Magazines disestablished in 1976 Category:Quarterly magazines published in the United States Category:Defunct American comics ","title":"Arcade (comics magazine)"},{"id":"12371694","text":"WSGB is a classic hits formatted broadcast radio station licensed to Sutton, West Virginia, serving Sutton and Braxton County, West Virginia. WSGB is owned and operated by Summit Media Broadcasting, LLC. ==History== WSGB first went on the air on January 22, 1964, broadcasting from studios at 406 Main Street in downtown Sutton. The station, which has had its same call letters its entire existence, was founded by Braxton Broadcasting Company. Company president Charles M. Erhard, Jr. also owned another station, WPME (now WECZ) in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. Erhard frequently used WSGB as a training ground for announcers hoping to work at WPME. Erhard was proud of West Virginia's heritage and as a reflection of this, made the John Denver song \\"Take Me Home Country Roads\\" (which pays homage to the state of West Virginia) as part of the station's daily sign-on message each morning. Erhard sold the station on May 1, 1974 to MultiMedia Associates III, a company headed by James R. Reese, Jr. Unforeseen circumstances forced another sale to Centerstate Broadcasting in September 1976. William Becker served as company president and general manager. WSGB was sold again on June 1, 1980 to Milliken Investment Corporation. Soon afterwards, the station moved to 180 Main Street, where it remains today. The station also was granted permission to raise its nighttime power from 250 to 900 watts in the early 80s. It was under this ownership that WSGB prospered greatly, with the sign-on of FM sister station WCKA on April 25, 1987. Milliken also transferred the license to its subsidiary, Mid-State Broadcasting Corporation, also that same year. After almost two decades of ownership, Milliken Investment Corporation sold the station to its current owner, Summit Media Broadcasting, LLC for $250,000, along with WCKA. The sale took place on December 30, 1999. ==WSGB today== Following the acquisition of WSGB by Summit Media Broadcasting, WSGB underwent a major renovation of its studios and offices, which included a substantial upgrade of the station's studio facilities, moving it into the digital audio age with modern, state of the art equipment. In March 2007, Summit Media acquired WVAR in Richwood, West Virginia. Two months later, Summit Media began simulcasting WSGB's signal in an effort to improve its reception in Nicholas County, where WSGB's dial position was unable to adequately provide local service to that area. ==External links== *The Mighty 1490 Online SGB ","title":"WSGB"},{"id":"12371701","text":" USS Scuffle (AM-298) was an built for the United States Navy during World War II. She was awarded a Presidential Unit Citation and five battle stars for service in the Pacific during World War II. She was decommissioned in June 1946 and placed in reserve. While remaining in reserve, Scuffle was reclassified as MSF-298 in February 1955, but never reactivated. In October 1962, she was sold to the Mexican Navy and renamed ARM DM-05. In 1994, she was renamed ARM General Felipe Xicot√©ncatl (C53). She was sunk as an artificial reef and dive attraction off of Cozumel in 1999, and was stricken from the rolls of the Mexican Navy in 2000. == U.S. Navy career == Scuffle was laid down on 4 May 1943 by Winslow Marine Railway and Shipbuilding Co., Seattle, Washington; launched on 8 August 1943; sponsored by Miss Marianne Baron, and commissioned on 2 May 1944, Lt. Comdr. Erik A. Johnson in command. After shakedown, Scuffle sailed from San Francisco, California, on 11 July 1944 for Hawaii. Operating out of Pearl Harbor, she swept an old American-laid minefield in the French Frigate Shoals between 6 and 15 August, escorted a convoy to Eniwetok, and carried out various tests and training operations. She arrived at San Pedro Bay, Leyte, on 31 December 1944 and joined Mine Division 34. With her division, Scuffle participated in the pre-invasion sweeps at Lingayen Gulf on 6 January 1945, and at Zambales and Subic Bay on the 29th and 31st. In each instance, after completing the pre-invasion sweeps, she helped extend the cleared areas during and after the initial troop landings, and provided antisubmarine and antiaircraft protection for the transports. On 13 February, her division began pre-invasion sweeps in Manila Bay in preparation for landings at Mariveles and Corregidor. While operating off Corregidor on the 14th, the minesweepers came within of the island and were repeatedly straddled by Japanese fire before supporting ships silenced the enemy's guns. Scuffle continued sweeping in Manila Bay through 18 February, and her unit earned a Navy Unit Commendation for the operation. On 24 February, Scuffle re- entered Manila Bay with 15 YMS's to clear the harbor of mines and submerged wrecks. Her force, plus the salvage ship , accomplished the task by 10 April, sweeping of water and opening the Harbor to supply ships. On 22 April, she rejoined Mine Division 34 in an 8-day sweep of the Sulu Sea off Palawan. On 9 May, the minesweeper arrived at Morotai to prepare for operations in the Netherlands East Indies. On 2 June, Scuffle sailed from Morotai with her division to carry out a pre-invasion sweep in Brunei Bay. She ran aground on a reef on 6 June, damaging a screw, but was able to carry out her assigned sweeps before sailing, on 12 June, for repairs at Subic Bay. She rejoined her division on 26 June off Balikpapan and provided support to YMS's performing the pre-invasion sweep. She left Balikpapan on 8 July and returned to Subic Bay for a month of overhaul. Scuffles task group received a Presidential Unit Citation for its service off Balikpapan. The minesweeper left the Philippines on 6 September and arrived at Sasebo, Japan, on 20 October after weathering three typhoons en route. She helped sweep Japanese minefields in Tsushima Strait and the Ryukyu Islands until sailing from Sasebo for home on 9 December. Arriving at Orange, Texas, on 2 April 1946, she was decommissioned there on 19 June 1946 and placed in reserve. Scuffle received 5 battle stars for her World War II service. While she remained in reserve, Scuffle was reclassified MSF-298 effective 7 February 1955. She was struck from the Navy list on 1 May 1962 and transferred to Mexico on 1 October 1962. == Mexican Navy career == In October 1962, the former Scuffle was acquired by the Mexican Navy and renamed ARM DM-05. In 1994, she was renamed ARM General Felipe Xicot√©ncatl (C53). In 1999, she was reportedly sunk off Cozumel, then, in 2000, was stricken from the rolls of the Mexican Navy. == Underwater Scuba Park and Artificial Reef == After 55 years of service C-53 was decommissioned and later donated to Cozumel underwater park. C-53 was sunk in 1999 in 82' of water just off shore from Chankanaab Park. http://scubaclubcozumel.com/index.php/felipe-xicotencatl http://ecodiverscozumel.com/blog/cozumel-wreck-the-felipe-xicotencatl The C-53 was stabilized and anchored by a series of massive concrete blocks and became home to an abundance of soft corals, sponges and tropical fish. A common inhabitant of the C-53 are the Glassy Sweepers. On October 22, 2005, a Category 5 hurricane named \\"Wilma\\", pushed the C-53 from its original position North approximately 100 feet. The force of the hurricane also nearly completely tore the C-53 in half - however the ship remains vertical and is stable for continued diving and exploration. As of this update, the C-53 is home to a wide array of corals, soft corals, sponges and marine life. It is one of the most popular dives among certified divers. Due to its depth, it is not a dive for beginners. == Notes  References == * * Category:Admirable-class minesweepers Category:Ships built in Seattle Category:1943 ships Category:World War II minesweepers of the United States Category:Admirable-class minesweepers of the Mexican Navy Category:Shipwrecks of Mexico Category:Shipwrecks in the Caribbean Sea Category:Underwater diving sites in Cozumel ","title":"USS Scuffle (AM-298)"},{"id":"12371704","text":"Morelet's tree frog (Agalychnis moreletii) is a species of leaf frog in the family Phyllomedusidae. It is found in Belize, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Mexico. They have also been called black-eyed leaf frog and popeye hyla. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forest, subtropical or tropical moist montane forest, freshwater marshes, and intermittent freshwater marshes. == Description == This is a rare frog which has a green body, black eyes and a red or pink underbelly. They are found in moist subtropical lowland mountainous forests and wetland habitats of Belize, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Mexico. They have been collected on the Atlantic and Pacific slopes of Veracruz, Chiapas, the Maya mountains of Belize, northwestern Honduras and El Salvador. They can live in pristine or disturbed habitats and will breed in temporary or permanent bodies of water. They have an extended breeding season during the summer months. They deposit clutches of 50 to 75 eggs on vegetation or rocks over water. The eggs of the Morelet's tree frog have a green pigment and when they hatch, the larvae fall into the water to complete their development into frogs. == Conservation == Morelet's tree frog was abundant within its range and were kept as pets internationally. Industry and agriculture are thought to be the main causes of lowland montane forest destruction. The population of Morelet's tree frogs are also being affected due to a disease called Chytridiomycosis, which is an infectious disease that kills amphibians. Chytridiomycosis and habitat destruction are projected to cause the population to decline over 80% in the next 10 years. In some regions, the frogs have gone extinct completely. For example, a study done in 2004, has claimed that Morelet's tree frog may be extirpated from the region of Southern Mexico. Their survival is dependent upon several factors due to their human and disease caused population decline. Some conservation measures are in place, while others are still in need of implementation or research. A number of protected parks have been created to curb habitat destruction in areas of Central America and Mexico. Taxonomic research is currently in place to further understand the population's status. More data are needed, however, on a temporal and spatial scale to determine trends in the population of Morelet's tree frogs. ==ReferencesFurther reading== *Lee, J.C. 1996.

It is found in the Caribbean lowlands from north-eastern Honduras through Nicaragua to east-central Costa Rica at elevations of asl. Its common names are parachuting red-eyed leaf frog and misfit leaf frog. ==Description== Male Agalychnis saltator measure and females in snout‚Äìvent length. They have distinctive red eyes with vertical pupils. The dorsum is light or dark leaf green with bluish purple flanks. They have large suction disks and extensive webbing between the fingers and toes. ==Habitat and behaviour== Agalychnis saltator are nocturnal and arboreal. They inhabit lowland and montane humid and wet forests, and to a lesser extent, adjacent premontane wet forests and rainforests. They live in tree canopies, but descend to temporary pools to reproduce. Male frog can leap from considerable heights to plants on the mating sites, extending its limbs and spreading out the skin between its fingers and toes, hence the name \\"parachuting frog\\". ==Reproduction== Agalychnis saltator are explosive breeders that breed after heavy rains. A single breeding aggregation may contain 25‚Äì400 frogs (typically 100‚Äì200), hanging on vines that overhang temporary ponds in forested areas, and on marsh vegetation (e.g. Spathiphyllum). Most individuals in the aggregation are couples in amplexus, with one female frog being accompanied by one to four males. The eggs are laid amidst mosses covering the vines, but are very vulnerable to predation at this stage. Agalychnis saltator males have also been observed in amplexus with Agalychnis callidryas females. The eggs from such matings are infertile. ==Conservation== Agalychnis saltator has a naturally fragmented distribution. It is not particularly common, but it is regularly seen on breeding sites. It is locally suffering from further fragmentation of its habitat because of deforestation from agricultural development and logging. However, it is not threatened on the whole. Agalychnis saltator is collected for illegal pet trade. It is listed in CITES Appendix II. ==References== saltator Category:Amphibians of Costa Rica Category:Amphibians of Honduras Category:Amphibians of Nicaragua Category:Amphibians described in 1955 Category:Taxa named by Edward Harrison Taylor Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Agalychnis saltator"},{"id":"12371715","text":"The gliding tree frog (Agalychnis spurrelli) is a species of frog in family Phyllomedusidae. It is found in Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, and Panama. Other common names are the gliding leaf frog, Spurrell's leaf frog, and pink- sided tree frog. The specific name, spurrelli, is in honour of British zoologist Herbert George Flaxman Spurrell. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests and intermittent freshwater marshes. It is threatened by habitat loss. ==Description== The gliding tree frog grows to a snout to vent length of for males and for females. The head is broad and the eyes are large, with reticulated lower eyelids. The body is slim with smooth skin on the dorsal surface and limbs and granular skin on the belly. The limbs are slim and the fingers and toes have adhesive discs. The fingers are about three-quarter webbed and the toes fully webbed. The colour of the dorsal surface of this frog changes at nightfall from pale green to dark green. The underparts are cream and orange. ==Distribution== The gliding tree frog is native to the humid forests of south-eastern and south-western Costa Rica, Panama, the Pacific lowlands of Colombia, and north-western Ecuador. ==Biology== The gliding tree frog is a nocturnal species that lives in the tree canopy. It moves about by climbing using a hand-over-hand form of locomotion. It also glides while leaping which it does by spreading out its hands and feet when the extensive webbing acts as a parachute. It can maintain an angle of descent of up to 45¬∞ for some distance. Explosive breeding takes place in the rainy season. The eggs are laid in small clusters on the upperside of leaves overhanging temporary pools and water-filled cavities in logs. The eggs hatch in about six days and the tadpoles fall into the water below. ==References== Category:Agalychnis Category:Amphibians of Colombia Category:Amphibians of Costa Rica Category:Amphibians of Ecuador Category:Amphibians of Panama Category:Amphibians described in 1913 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Gliding tree frog"},{"id":"12371723","text":"Triprion spinosus, also known as the spiny-headed tree frog, spiny-headed treefrog, spinyhead treefrog, coronated treefrog, and crowned hyla, is a species of frog in the family Hylidae. It has a spotty distribution in Panama, Costa Rica, Honduras, and southern Mexico. Previously in its own monotypic genus Anotheca Smith, 1939, it was transferred to the genus Triprion in 2018. ==Description== This species is a relative large frog with a snout‚Äìto‚Äìvent length of . It has numerous sharp, pointed projections on the head and dorsal surface, hence the common name. The skin on the head is fused to the skull and the tympanum is very large. The legs are long and slender and the digits have adhesive discs at the tips. The dorsal surface is pale brown or gray, with dark markings, and the flanks are dark brown or black, the colors being separated by a narrow white band. ==Ecology== This species is active at night when the male's call \\"boop...boop...boop\\" is more likely to be heard than the frog is to be seen. The male calls from beside a temporary water body, a water-filled hollow in a tree or the water caught in the rosette of a bromeliad, and this is where the female lays. The developing tadpoles will be safe from large predators such as fish, but there is a dearth of suitable food in these minute pools. The female frog solves this problem by periodically visiting each of the locations where she has laid, and laying unfertilised eggs for the young to feed on. The tadpoles stimulate her to do this by nibbling at her belly. Up to sixteen tadpoles have been found in a single transient pool. ==Habitat and conservation== Triprion spinosus occurs in lowland rainforests and montane humid forests at elevations of above sea level. However, in at least Costa Rica and Panama, it can be common in young secondary growth forest and coffee plantations far from forest. Breeding takes place in tree holes. It is threatened by severe disturbance, clearance and transformation of its original habitat to open areas. It is present in a number of protected areas. A captive \\"insurance\\" population is bred and maintained by the El Valle Amphibian Conservation Center, Panama, Atlanta Botanical Garden, United States, and a few AZA zoos. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * spinosus Category:Amphibians of Costa Rica Category:Amphibians of Honduras Category:Amphibians of Mexico Category:Amphibians of Panama Category:Taxa named by Franz Steindachner Category:Amphibians described in 1864 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Triprion spinosus"},{"id":"12371736","text":"The Bokermann's casque-headed frog (Aparasphenodon bokermanni) is a species of frog in the family Hylidae.

The specific name brunoi was in honour of Dr Bruno Lobo, Professor and Director of the National Museum of Brazil (1915-1923). ==Description== This species is a relative large frog; males have a snout‚Äìto‚Äìvent length of while females measure . The head is broad and flattened with a long pointed snout. The eyes are prominent and forward-facing. It has an array of sharp, pointed projections on the head, and the skin on the head is fused to the skull. The legs are long and slender and the digits have adhesive discs at the tips. The dorsal surface is pale brown or gray, with irregular dark markings. ==Distribution and habitat== Bruno's casque-headed frog is endemic to the coastal region of southeastern Brazil, east of the Brazilian Highlands. Its range extends southwards from the state of Bahia to the northern part of the state of S√£o Paulo. It is found in forests and forest edges, hiding by day in water-filled hollows in trees or bamboos, and in the water-filled rosettes of bromeliads. It chooses to hide in a crevice that is exactly the correct size, and uses its head to seal the entrance. Its maximum altitude is about . Unlike poison dart frogs which merely secrete poison from their skin, this species is equipped with skull spines capable of injecting venom into other animals or human hands via headbutting, a tactic it shares with Corythomantis greeningi. The venom of A. brunoi is estimated to be 25 times as toxic as that of local fer-de-lance pit vipers. ==References== Category:Aparasphenodon Category:Endemic fauna of Brazil Category:Amphibians of Brazil Category:Amphibians described in 1920 Category:Venomous vertebrates Category:Taxa named by Al√≠pio de Miranda-Ribeiro Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Bruno's casque-headed frog"},{"id":"12371747","text":"Aparasphenodon venezolanus is a species of frog in the family Hylidae.

It is endemic to Brazil. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests, subtropical or tropical moist montane forests, and rivers. It is threatened by habitat loss. ==Description== The Bocaina treefrog can grow to a snout-to-vent length of about . It has a broad head and pointed snout, and vomerine teeth situated on the roof of its mouth. The large, bulging eyes have golden irises with a horizontal slit pupil, and the tympanum is easily discernible. There is a single vocal sac in the throat. Not only is the general colour of this frog green, but its muscles and bones are green, as well. Several species of closely related tree frogs inhabit the Brazilian forest habitat. The Bocaina treefrog has distinctive, large granulations in the region of its cloacal vent, which helps to distinguish it from other species. Its tadpoles are also distinctive. ==Distribution== The Bocaina treefrog is an arboreal species known from the mountainous parts of south-eastern Brazil at up to above sea level. Much of its range is in national parks, such as the Serra da Bocaina National Park, from where it was first described. Its habitat is in both virgin forests and old secondary growth forests near mountain streams. It does not generally occur in agricultural areas or near human settlements. ==Reproduction== Breeding takes place between September and February. The male calls at night from among rocks or from the banks of streams in forests. The eggs are laid in underground nests in the muddy bank, and the developing tadpoles live on the bottom of the stream. They undergo metamorphosis when about long. ==Status== Aplastodiscus albosignatus is listed as being of Least Concern in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, and is a common species within its range.

It is endemic to the coastal mountains of Santa Catarina, Brazil. The specific name cochranae honors Doris Mable Cochran, an American herpetologist. Common name canebrake treefrog has been coined for this species. ==Description== Adult males measure and adult females, based on only two specimens, in snout‚Äìvent length. The overall appearance is robust. The snout is rounded, but may be truncated in lateral view. The tympanum is covered by skin but is visible in most specimens. The supra-tympanic fold is well-developed. The fingers have large discs and webbing between fingers II to IV. The toe discs are smaller than those on the fingers; there is basal webbing between the toes II to V. The dorsal coloration is cream-rosy to reddish-brown with scattered melanophores. A black line passes from the nostril along the canthus rostralis to the eye. The lower parts have light pink color, and flanks and joints show violet tones. Males have single subgular vocal sac. Late-stage tadpoles (Gosner stage 36) are dorsally grayish brown and ventrally grayish. They measure in total length, of which the body makes one third. ==Habitat and conservation== Aplastodiscus cochranae live in understorey vegetation of the edge of rainforest at elevations of above sea level. Breeding takes place in small water-filled holes in the ground. Aplastodiscus cochranae is an abundant species, and the overall population is considered to be stable.

It's part of the Fair Youth sequence, and the eighth sonnet of the Rival Poet group. ==Exegesis== This sonnet and the previous one (Sonnet 84) expand on the idea of the poet's silence. The poet is tongue-tied observer, but recognizes the beautiful praises being expressed by a rival poet. The poet asserts that his own tacit, though inwardly felt devotion is worth even more. It is, paradoxically, a complexly eloquent sonnet supporting the superiority of unspoken love. The Muse (line 1) is holding her silence, and respectfully allowing the rival to speak. Or line 1 may be suggesting that the rival poet's flattery is rude, and it is a sense of manners that continues (\\"still\\") to maintain the poet in silence. The young man's character is being preserved (line 3) with beautiful fancy writing (\\"golden quill\\"). It was the job of the parish clerk to lead the congregation in saying aloud \\"amen\\"; an illiterate clerk might say \\"amen\\" too often (line 6). The poet's love maintains a place ahead of the others (\\"holds his rank before\\"). The couplet contextualizes the \\"breath\\" mentioned in Sonnet 81, and derogates words (\\"others for the breath of words respect\\") for being insubstantial as a breath, and favors the poets own silent thoughts. The effect the young man is having on the poets is placed in two extremes: The poets are either spinning out glorious words and phrases, or they are struck dumb. Both extremes are contained in the paradox of this elaborately worded sonnet that speaks in favor of silence.Shakespeare, William. Duncan-Jones, Katherine. Shakespeare‚Äôs Sonnets.

Barnes & Noble. 1981. p. 107. ==Structure== Sonnet 85 is an English or Shakespearean sonnet, which has three quatrains, followed by a final rhyming couplet. It follows the rhyme scheme ABAB CDCD EFEF GG and is composed in iambic pentameter, a metre of five feet per line, with two syllables in each foot accented weak/strong.

The snout is rounded, and a single vocal sac is on the throat. The iris is golden, tinged with orange around the edge, and the tympanum is clearly visible. The fingers and toes have large discs on the tips to help the frog retain grip when climbing. The dorsal surface of this frog is smooth and green, with a scattering of white spots, while the ventral surface is granular and cream- coloured with white flecks. The skin above the vent is ornamented by a short, white ridge. ==Distribution== A. leucopygius is an arboreal species and is endemic to the mountains near the south-eastern coast of Brazil at altitudes of above sea level. It is mainly found in forested areas near streams or temporary pools. ==Reproduction== Breeding takes place in the rainy season between December and February. The male calls from trees close to a body of water to attract a female. Often, several males near each other form a chorus. On the arrival, a female selects a male in an elaborate courtship ritual. This ends with the inspection by the female of an underground nesting chamber already prepared in a wet, muddy place by the male. If this is approved, mating takes place, and a raft of eggs is laid inside it.

Kane attended Taylor High School. While still in college, he worked for fellow designers Russell Sage and Giles Deacon and attracted the attention of Donatella Versace by winning the Lanc√¥me Colour Award in 2005. Kane subsequently won the Harrods Design Award for his MA Graduate collection, consisting of ¬£1,500 and a showpiece window in Harrods from 24 February to 8 March 2006. The collection consisted of stretch-lace dresses decorated with brass rings. He was immediately hired by Versace to work on the label's Atelier couture collection as well as consulting on shoes and accessories. He graduated from Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design in 2006.Profile of Kane, londonfashionweek.co.uk; accessed 26 July 2015. In December 2006, Kane was photographed by David Bailey for British Vogue alongside Antony Price, whose 1980s bombshell evening dresses and curvaceous feminine styles foreshadowed Kane's bandage-tight tailoring. In August 2014, Kane was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to The Guardian opposing Scottish independence in the run-up to September's referendum on that issue. ==Professional career== Christopher Kane dress chosen by Susanna Lau to represent 2013 in the Fashion Museum, Bath's Dress of the Year collection. Kane established his namesake label in 2006, with his sister, Tammy Kane, who studied at the Scottish College of Textile Design, running the financial side of the business and also assisting in his fabric creation and design process. His first independent show, presented on 20 September 2006, consisted of super-short bandage dresses in neon shades. Kane said of his collection that he \\"only used neon last year because it was [his] first collection and I wanted to go as bright as possible.\\" The collection was lauded by prominent international fashion critics and credited by various sources as a major contributor to summer 2007's 'fluoro' trends. In April 2006, Kane was awarded the Young Designer of the Year at the Scottish Fashion Awards. Subsequently, the designer launched a capsule collection for British high-street clothing store Topshop. His second collection, showcased on 13 February 2007, once again received positive reviews from leading critics. Moving away from his signature tight-fitted look, Kane showcased a collection of velvets and leathers in a more relaxed silhouette. This was also his first collaboration with prominent shoe designer Manolo Blahnik, who created the shoes for the show. Kane collaborations extend into music, whereby he designed costumes for Kylie Minogue's music video \\"2 Hearts\\". On 18 October 2007, he collaborated with Beth Ditto for luxury label Swarovski's Fashion Rocks show held at the Royal Albert Hall to critical acclaim. In addition to designing his own label and consulting at Versace, he is also part of Atlier Swarovski, a small collective of designers who create special jewellery collections for Swarovski. On 10 September 2007, days before Kane was scheduled to show his third collection, it was reported that 23 pieces from the Spring-Summer 2008 show had been stolen from his London studio. In addition to cashmere and leather pieces, a laptop was also stolen. No fingerprints were found upon inspection. However, the designer proceeded his third show and second collaboration with Blahnik seven days later on 17 September 2007, once again changing directions and introducing snake skin printed chiffon and denim in yet another collection that won rave reviews. On 27 November 2007, he was awarded New Designer of The Year at the British Fashion Awards. Kane has also been credited for single-handedly turning the fortunes of cashmere producer Johnstons of Elginby partnering with the company to produce his line of cashmere garments. Known to be a passionate promoter of his home country, the designer was appointed as an ambassador for VisitScotland in January 2008. He celebrated Burns Night by showcasing a special trunk show of his Spring-Summer 2008 collection as well as hosting an exclusive party at Harvey Nichols the ambassador for VisitScotland. Furthering his role, Kane collaborated with Lanc√¥me to create a limited edition Juicy Tube lip gloss. The finished product, called Burns Night, is a tangerine colour with a beautiful illustration printed on the tube along with Kane's signature and was launched in February 2008. On 12 February 2008, the designer showcased his fourth collection which departed again from his previous themes. Featuring dresses of layered organdy and plastic sequins, cable woven cashmere tops and dresses along with heavily embellished jackets, the show was greeted with similar praise from fashion critics. On 16 September 2008, Kane showcased his fifth collection, this time building upon his previous theme of circular sequins which \\"had grown into even bigger circles of chiffon and leather that rippled like scales around the models or created scalloped contours down their bodies to oscillating ‚Äì and very short ‚Äì hemlines.\\" Inspired by \\"Planet of the Apes\\" and \\"The Flintstones\\", it was met with similar praise from fashion critics. Commercially, the collection was a massive success, selling out within 24 hours of launch on Net-A-Porter.com on 13 February 2009. Kane presented his sixth collection on 21 February 2009, a show labelled as another \\"Best Ever\\". The collection featured nude chiffon dresses and was praised for its construction as a more mature offering. He also collaborated with Versace, producing a capsule collection of accessories for the younger Versus (Versace) line showcased on 2 March 2009. Donatella Versace later compared him to her late brother Gianni Versace. In 2009 and 2010, he collaborated with a professional British haircare brand Catwalk by TIGI to create an advertising campaign for the brand's three new product collections. On 15 January 2013, Kering (previously known as PPR) and Kane jointly announced that they have signed an agreement by which Kering acquires 51% of the designer's luxury brand, in order to develop the business in partnership with its creator. Kering plans to open Kane‚Äôs first freestanding boutique. On 2 December 2013, Kane was awarded the Women‚Äôs Wear Designer of the Year award at the 2013 British Fashion Awards at the London Coliseum. In 2018, Phoebe Tonkin wore a red dress from 2018 collection of Christopher Kane A pink dress by Kane trimmed with lace and gaffer tape was selected by the blogger Susanna Lau to represent 2013 in the Fashion Museum, Bath's Dress of the Year collection.

Thus, the species shows male-biased sexual size dimorphism, which is uncommon among frogs. In addition, males have well-developed pre- pollexes and more robust forearms than females. ==Ecology and behavior== Bokermannohyla pseudopseudis is a saxicolous species. It is a generalist, with the diet consists of various arthropods, with spiders, beetles, and cockroaches being the most important food items. There is some evidence to suggests that females are more choosy in their diet than males. Bokermannohyla pseudopseudis have a limited ability to perch on vegetation. The males call from rocks in the riverbed, often near waterfalls. Calling males and tadpoles have been found through the year, suggesting that breeding activity is prolonged in this species. Males often have scratch marks on their backs and heads, suggesting male-male combats. ==Habitat and conservation status== The species' natural habitats are rocky streams in the Cerrado. It occurs in rock crevices and calls from rock outcrops in the riverbed. The tadpoles occur in pools within deep sections of permanent streams and attach themselves to stones on the stream bottom. Its habitat is threatened by agriculture, logging, and dam construction, although the species is not classified as threatened.

It is found in Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, and southern Mexico. In Spanish, this frog is known as rana arbor√≠cula de bromelia. This frog used to be classified as Hyla bromeliacia before it was moved to the newly formed genus Bromeliohyla in 2005. Males measure 24.1‚Äì29.5 mm and females 32.0‚Äì36.0 mm in snout‚Äìvent length. ==Distribution== The bromeliad tree frog is found in premontane and lower montane wet forests on the Atlantic side of Chiapas State in Mexico, in the Maya Mountains of Belize and Guatemala, in central Guatemala and in northwest Honduras at elevations of above sea level. ==Biology== These frogs lay their eggs in the water-filled rosettes of bromeliads or other temporary, water-filled crevices in the canopy, such as the leaf sheaths of banana leaves. The tadpoles complete their development in these small pools. ==Fungal infection== A study was undertaken in Honduras to discover whether these frogs were infected by the chytrid fungus, which is causing devastation among amphibian populations worldwide. One-third of the individuals tested were found to be infected. These frogs spend their lives in the canopy and breed in the ephemeral, water-filled bromeliad rosettes, and are unlikely ever to come into contact with streams or pools which might be sources of infection. The researchers surmised the fungus might be spread by insects or birds, or by raindrops, but further research needs to be undertaken to establish how it is dispersed. ==Status== The bromeliad tree frog is listed as \\"Least Concern\\" in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. While it is a relatively rare species, it has quite large distribution area. However, it has declined at higher altitudes, possibly due to chytridiomycosis. In addition to chytridiomycosis, deforestation and pollution are believed to threaten this species.

Despite being thought of as mercenaries, the trio always act on the side of the good guys and help those who are in need. The series innovative visual style inspired by comic books consists on a combination of live action scenes and short animated sequences (creators have stated Frank Miller's Sin City graphic novels and Quentin Tarantino movies as influences). This, along with an action-packed plot and appealing characters turned it into a big success all over the country. The show ran for four seasons on Frecuencia Latina Peruvian television network. Additionally, in August 2007 opened the first movie in this series. == Origins == While shooting a car chase scene for the mini-series \\"Lobos de Mar\\" Jorge Carmona and Aldo Miyashiro thought about making their next project about a group of urban heroes. Ivan Lozano, the art director developed the character design using animation giving the creative duo the idea of combining live action with animation and comic book language. == Premise == La Gran Sangre is the name that Dragon, Mandril and Tony Blades, gave themselves after making a pact in which they swore to protect the oppressed. Friends since they were kids, each one of them had to live very difficult experiences in order to discover their true calling as justicieros (vigilantes). The group became a legend in the streets of Lima, known and respected by everyone, the three heroes protected the city for a long time, until Tony supposedly betrayed the others causing the breakup of the group. The once inseparable friends ended their brotherhood and the criminals returned to the streets. After breaking the blood pact that united them, they took different paths and swore not to see each other again. Years later, when La Gran Sangre was nothing but a myth to many, a desperate businessman whose 15-year-old daughter had been kidnapped accomplished what seemed impossible: find Dragon, the former leader of the group, now a martial arts expert committed to help teenagers from a rough neighborhood keep away from drugs and gangs. Dragon was reluctant to search for his old friends, but finally he realized they were the only ones that could save the girl's life, and after much struggling to convince Mandril and Tony, they made a new pact and became La Gran Sangre again. == Cast ==  Main characters  Carlos Alc√°ntara as Dragon (Seasons: 1; 2; 3) Aldo Miyashiro as Tony Blades (Seasons: 1; 2; 3; 4) Pietro Sibille as Mandril (Seasons: 1; 2; 3; 4)  Additional team members  Norka Ramirez as Raquel (Seasons: 1; 2; 3) Joel Ezeta as Johan (Seasons: 1; 2; 3; 4) Lucho Caceres as Cobra (Seasons: 1; 2; 3) Roxana Yepez as Ivana (Only as Ivana, season: 4)  Supporting characters  David Kam as El Maestro (Season: 2 / Guest starring: 1; 3) Anahi Vargas as Tota (Season: 2 / Guest starring: 3)  Recurring antagonists and supporting characters  Haysen Percovich as Conde (Seasons: 1; 3; 4) Roxana Yepez as Seca (Only as Seca, seasons: 1; 2; 3) Ivan Chavez as Verdes (Seasons: 1; 3) Camila McLennan as Diana (Season: 2; 4) Erika Villalobos as Medusa (Season: 2; 4) Katerine D'Onofrio as Venus (Season: 2; 4) Francesca Brivio as Gaia(Season: 2) Lizet Chavez as Ceres(Season: 2) Diego Caceres as Gringo (Season: 3) Lita Baluarte as Doncella (Season: 3) Angie Jibaja as Ming Nao(Season: 3) Carlos Cardozo as Roble (Season: 3) Juan Manuel Ochoa as Mesias (Season: 4) R√≥mulo Assereto Uno (Season: 4) Mar√≠a Claudia Carmona Elena(Season: 4) == Season synopses ==  Season One  A 15-year-old girl named Allison Tamani has been kidnapped. It's been 20 days and the police can't find her. Every clue seems to vanish, and her father, a wealthy businessman is desperate. A video in which the girl appears living in subhuman conditions is shown in every local news show. The criminals ask for a 1 million dollar ransom, and threaten to cut off parts of Allison's body if her father fails to pay it on time. Dragon, Mandril and Tony Blades, are the former members of a group called La Gran Sangre, which in other times dedicated to solve similar cases and to defend those who were in need. Separated for many years, each one lives their own life not knowing each other's whereabouts. From different sides of the city the three of them watch the news and feel profound indignation. Mr. Tamani, convinced that nobody but them can save his daughter, manages to reach Dragon with the hope he will reform La Gran Sangre. After much doubt he decides to fulfill his destiny and accepts, not knowing that reunite his old friends is a task more difficult than he believed and that the girl's kidnapper is no other that Conde, Dragon's mortal enemy whom everybody believed dead after their last encounter, waiting for his bloody revenge.  Season Two  Raquel, Cobra and Johan are admitted as new official members and the restructured group decide to move in together. As they continue to fight crime in the streets, a series of organized robberies suddenly gets them involved in a big case. A reckless band of female thieves, Diana, Venus and Medusa, who call themselves \\"las diosas malditas\\" (the evil goddesses) are sacking the national heritage. The political and cultural high spheres cannot trust the police. In the middle of the confusion the director of the National Bank proposes that La Gran Sangre take over the case and bring the goddesses to justice. The case seems simple, but the three criminals would be able to challenge the abilities of La Gran Sangre in an unexpected way. Not only are they young and attractive, but also members of the upper social class of Lima, unknown environment for the heroes.  Season Three  After the death of Mandril, chaos and uncertainty takes over the members of La Gran Sangre. Raquel, Johan and Cobra try to convince Dragon and Tony to not give up on the team, but both cave in to their pain, and feeling devastated, each one takes his own path. Meanwhile, Conde has recovered from his defeat and is ready to face his old enemy. To accomplish this he joins efforts with a new force of evil: Gringo, a powerful drug lord who embraces the fight against La Gran Sangre. Alongside him will fight Ming Nao, expert in seduction; Doncella, expert in poisons; and Roble expert in Wrestling. Joining them will also be Seca and Verdes who have been feeding up their rage against La Gran Sangre during their time in jail. This time the evil gang has the upper hand. La Gran Sangre must overcome their own issues first, in order to defeat the group of merciless villains and survive.  Season Four  After the defeat of El Conde, peace reigns over the city. However, the heroes go each their separate way, with no plans of getting back together in the near future. However, peace is quickly threatened by El Mes√≠as (The Messiah), who leads the M.P.S.P. (Movement for the salvation of Per√∫), a terrorist organization aiming to take over the country. Mandril must reunite with Tony and handle the case on their own, as Dragon has travelled to China and is impossible to reach him. Other villains of the series make their comebacks in this final season. == Merchandise ==  Comics  A 10-issue mini-series telling the backstory of La Gran Sangre was released by Capitan Perez Producciones after the end of season one.

Prior to its description, it was mixed with Hyla chaneque (now Charadrahyla chaneque). The specific name nephila is derived from Greek nephos (\\"cloud\\") and philia (\\"fondness\\"), referring to the cloud forest habitat of this species. Common name Oaxacan cloud-forest treefrog has been coined for it. ==Description== Adult males measure and adult females in snout‚Äìvent length. The body is slender. The snout is rounded. The tympanum is distinct and rounded but dorsally obscured by the thick supra-tympanic fold. The fingers and the toes are long, slender, and partially webbed, bearing large terminal discs (slightly smaller in the fingers than in the toes). Dorsal skin is smooth. Coloration is sexually dimorphic: females have reddish brown ground color, whereas that of males gray-brown to mauve. Both sexes have large, irregular blotches on the dorsum. The blotches are usually greenish and bordered with dark brown, but are sometimes uniformly dark brown in some large males. The limbs have dark crossbars. The iris varies from pale copper to bronze and has fine black reticulations. ==Habitat and conservation== Charadrahyla nephila inhabits mesic cloud forests at elevations of above sea level. It is commonly found in or near streams and low vegetation. Breeding presumably takes place in streams. It is nocturnal. Charadrahyla nephila is a common species, but its habitat is suffering from a high degree of disturbance. Tadpoles have been found with symptoms indicative of chytridiomycosis, representing an additional threat.

The general color is light brown or gray, liberally blotched with red or brown patches; females are generally darker in color than males. ==Distribution and habitat== Corythomantis greeningi is endemic to northeastern Brazil. Its range extends as far south as the northern part of Minas Gerais state. It inhabits a caatinga ecoregion, a semi-desert vegetation of shrublands and thorn forest. This experiences a short wet season, lasting about three months, and a long hot dry season. ==Ecology== With a need to keep its skin moist and as a protection against predators, C. greeningi conceals itself in a tree hollow, a rock crevice, a bromeliad or other suitable location. In the laboratory, a female frog used a test tube for a retreat, sealing off the aperture with its head. In their natural habitat, when the rainy season starts and the creeks and channels run with water, male frogs establish territories near the watercourses and call to attract females. Several hundred eggs are laid by the female, attached to a rock in the watercourse. This frog has evolved certain adaptations to enable it to live in a semi-arid environment. The head is roughened and flat, and the skin of the head is fused to the skull forming a casque; these features are often associated with phragmotic behaviour, in which an animal defends itself in a burrow by using its own body as a barrier. It has adapted its life cycle and method of reproduction to suit its environment. It also has a tough, impermeable skin which helps limit water loss, and a low basal metabolic rate which limits evaporation through its lungs. Unlike poison dart frogs which merely secrete poison from their skin, this species is equipped with skull spines capable of injecting venom into other animals, or human hands, via headbutting, a tactic it shares with Aparasphenodon brunoi. The skin secretions contain a number of low-molecular mass steroids and alkaloids. In the laboratory, these produce a powerful nociceptive (painful) effect and cause oedema in mice cells. The secretions also inhibit cell growth in mouse fibroblasts and melanoma cells. In the wild, these provide a useful arsenal of chemical defences against predation. ==Status== This frog has a wide range and is a common species with a large total population. The main threats it faces include habitat loss from livestock grazing and crop cultivation, and the occurrence of wildfires. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\", because any decrease in population size is likely to be at too slow a rate to justify classifying it in a more threatened category. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:Corythomantis Category:Venomous vertebrates Category:Amphibians described in 1896 Category:Amphibians of Brazil Category:Endemic fauna of Brazil Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Corythomantis greeningi"},{"id":"12371965","text":" The Breda A.9 was a biplane trainer produced in Italy in 1928 for the Regia Aeronautica.

The common names of D. ebraccatus come from the dark hourglass shaped pattern found in the centre of the back and the distinct smooth yellow thighs that contrast the rest of the brazenly patterned body. The contrasting of the smooth yellow thighs from the rest of the bodies pattern provide the illusion that D. ebraccatus is not wearing pants. The name ebraccata in Latin means \\"without trousers\\". D. ebraccatus has a number of unique reproductive features, such as the ability to alter rates of hatching shared in a number of Anura families. D. ebraccatus is also extremely unique in its ability to alter its mode of reproduction as it is the only known vertebrate to be able to do so. ==Taxonomy== Dendropsophus ebraccatus is a member of the wide-ranging tree frog family Hylidae and the genus Dendropsophus. Dendropsophus is a group of small primarily yellow tree frogs found in dense jungles throughout Central and South America. A unique feature of the genus is that all individuals within the genus have 30 chromosomes. After a large revision to the family Hylidae following Faivovich et al. (2005) the genus Dendropsophus was revived and separated from Hyla. ==Distribution and habitat== The hourglass tree frog is native to southern Mexico, Belize, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, western Colombia, and northwestern Ecuador. They can be found in terrestrial and freshwater habitats, usually under the canopy of tropical rainforests, and prefer temperature ranges of 74-76 ¬∞F with moderately high humidity between 60-70%. It has an upper elevation limit of 1,600 metres (Pough 2004). ==Physiology== These are smooth, small treefrogs exhibiting sexual dimorphism. Males are significantly smaller than females. Their dorsal coloration consists of an hourglass pattern on their backs with gold spots in this pattern. This pattern varies from bright yellow-green to pale yellow or cream. They are also called ‚Äúpantless frogs‚Äù. When you extend their hind legs you can see that only on their thighs they do not have the pattern continued but rather just a pale yellow color.Cope 1874 The hourglass tree frog has relatively large forelimbs in comparison to the proportion of its body. It has well developed toe discs for tree climbing. Their toe pads adhere via deformation of the soft epithelial cells. They also have long hind limbs for jumping from tree to tree (Touchon and Warkentin 2008) [10]. As compared to most Anura they are capable of gas exchange through their permeable skin.Pough 2004 The frog family Hylidae has the unique adaptation of forming cocoons (by shedding the outer skin layer of the stratum corneum) or refuge in tree holes to protect themselves from desiccation during unfavorable conditions. They also wipe themselves with waxy lipid secretions from their lipid glands in the dorsal skin to reduce water loss (Castanho 2001)[1]. They also secrete a watery mucus to aid in evaporative cooling. Their granular glands contain a wide range of bioactive molecules for defense. Compounds such as alkaloids, quinones, steroids, biogenic amines and a diversity of biologically active peptides can be found across the family Hylidae.Konig 2012 Adults are nocturnal creatures, their diet consists of small arthropods. While tadpoles are macrophagous herbivores or cannobols as they feed on dead tadpoles (Cope 1874)[4]. They can make loud calls due to the elasticity of their throats. Their call is a prolonged ‚Äúcreek‚Äù followed by several higher pitched ‚Äúeeks‚Äù. They emit rain calls in the daytime before or during a rain shower. ==Reproduction== Hourglass tree frogs migrate to freshwater pools in vegetated areas to breed during the rainy seasons of Central and South America, between May and November [13]. Once aggregated around freshwater pools, they utilize chorus and mate finding strategies to select mates. Males hide behind foliage around edges of marshes and ponds during the night and produce long mating calls to attract potential female mates. Once a male is selected by a female, he will climb onto her back and release his sperm into her cloaca. Females reproduce multiple times within the breeding season, with gaps between reproductive spells as short as 10 days. Females will lay between 180 and 300 eggs, separated between up to eight different masses within a single night [13]. Egg masses are laid either in single layers on the upper surface of leaves overhanging freshwater or in clusters connected to floating vegetation within the water itself, depending on various environmental factors. Hourglass tree frogs are unique in their reproductive plasticity, allowing them to produce both aquatic and arboreal eggs. Arboreal eggs are deposited on the upper surfaces of leaves overhanging water, so the tadpoles can roll into the water once hatched, and aquatic eggs are attached to floating vegetation within the water to keep the eggs from sinking. If there is a risk of egg desiccation, eggs will be placed in the hydrating water, but if there is a risk of egg predation from fish in freshwater pools, eggs will be placed on leaves [13]. The threat of aquatic predation has been shown to outway the risk of desiccation. Undisturbed Aquatic eggs develop at a slightly faster rate than arboreal eggs with an average hatch time of 3.5 days after placement. Both egg groups can alter their rate of development in the presence of unfavourable conditions such as weather or predation. Rates of development and hatching time can be altered from 67% faster to 600% slower than undisturbed hatch times [13]. The rate of development is partially controlled by the rate of enzyme secretion by the hatching gland within the egg. The enzymes secreted by the hatching gland control the rate at which the eggs gel membrane is degradation [8]. Once eggs hatch, tadpoles either emerge in the water or roll of leaves into the pond below. Tadpoles are brown and gold with black eye bands and develop bright red tail colours in the presence of predators. Tadpoles feed on micro fauna and scavenge what they can in the water until they mature after 6‚Äì8 weeks. Young frogs live near pools of water and only make their way back to the forest canopy when nearing adulthood. ==Conservation== The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species listed the Hourglass Tree Frog as a species of least concern (LC) in 2010 due to wide distribution, stable, large population, and high tolerance to adapt to habitat modifications. This species population is in many protected areas throughout the range. Although it is very adaptable it still faces many threats such as deforestation, agriculture and aquaculture (livestock farming and ranching, annual and perennial non-timber crops), logging, residential and commercial development, the pet industry, and pollution. ==Research== The skin of the family Hylidae is vastly studied due to its rich sources of bioactive peptides, which has spiked the interest for drug development (Conlon 2014) [2]. Hylids use the peptides in defense against bacteria, fungi, protozoans, viruses, and desiccation (Conlon 2014) [2]. These peptides are of interest to scientist due to their anti-infective and therapeutic potential. Peptides have been found to stimulate insulin release for Type 2 diabetes mellitus therapy (Conlon 2014) [2]. They are also used for their ability to be the precursor for encoding cDNAs (Konig 2012) [6]. Pathogenic bacteria and fungi antibiotic resistance constitutes a serious threat to public health worldwide, scientists are looking to frogs skin secretions for further drug advancements (Conlon 2014) [2] ==NotesReferences== **# Castanho L.M. 2001.

It was released as the first and lead single on May 5, 1998 by Epic Records, from her eighth studio album, gloria!. The song was written by Kike Santander and produced by Emilio Estefan, Jr. and Santander. The single was a hit in Europe, the US, Australia and Japan. In Spain, it peaked at number-one. It also reached the Top 5 in Hungary and Top 20 in Scotland and the UK. In the US, the song reached number 27 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 7 on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. The song can be described as a ballad with a dance music background. It was given to Estefan by Celine Dion. Estefan performed \\"Heaven's What I Feel\\" at many TV-concerts and shows, like the 1998 VH1 Divas Live, Top of the Pops and the 1998 World Music Awards. The song was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording but lost to Madonna's smash hit \\"Ray of Light\\". But the music video, directed by Bille Woodruff, where Estefan is seen flying in space received the ALMA Award for \\"Best Outstanding Video\\". ==Song history== The song was written by Colombian- American composer Kike Santander. It was first recorded by Canadian singer Celine Dion, but she did not feel it was right for her 1997 album, so the song was given to Estefan. Santander co-produced it with Estefan's husband, Emilio Estefan, Jr.. It was recorded in three languages: English, Spanish and French and was made available on May 5, 1998 by Epic Records. The Spanish version titled \\"Coraz√≥n Prohibido\\" (\\"Forbidden Heart\\") was released as a single in Spain, where it topped the charts. The French version titled \\"Amour Infini\\" (\\"Endless Love\\") was only available on the Canadian and the French album releases, and on the European Limited Edition 2-Disc release of the gloria! album. The single received a massive promotion. Estefan first performed the song at the 1998 VH1 Divas Live where she received a standing ovation for her performance; she also performed at the legendary Studio 54 in New York City. Then she sang it again at the 1998 World Music Awards in Monaco where she was the hostess of the event. Then it was promoted in a lot of television programs around the world, like the British music chart television programme Top of the Pops. \\"Heaven's What I Feel\\" was popular in Europe, Japan and the US. It peaked at number 27 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 7 on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. In Europe, the single reached the Top 5 in Hungary, Top 20 in Scotland and the UK, and Top 40 in Belgium and Switzerland. The B-side of the single was the \\"Gloria Hitmix\\", which had not been available in any other single issue since. There were two different versions of the song: \\"Edit\\" and \\"Full Version\\" (this mix includes the songs: \\"I'm Not Giving You Up\\", \\"Reach\\", \\"You'll Be Mine (Party Time)\\", \\"Mi Tierra\\", \\"Live for Loving You\\", \\"Tres Deseos\\", \\"Everlasting Love\\" and \\"Turn the Beat Around.\\") ==Critical reception== Ben Wener from Beaver Country Times noted \\"the lush orchestration\\" of the song in his review of gloria!. Larry Flick from Billboard described it as a \\"deliciously sweet confection that takes the listener back to the days of disco with its wonderfully vibrant strings and rumbling percussion. La G is in exceptional voice here, hitting high notes she's never touched before‚Äîand doing so with a delightfully romantic flair. The fingerprints of top clubland producer Tony Moran are all over the track, starting with its muscular bassline and unabashedly gleeful keyboards.\\" He noted that the song has \\"cute lyrics and instantly sing-along chorus.\\" Chuck Taylor noted it as a \\"tasty\\" track. The Daily Vault's Alfredo Narvaez called it a \\"flamboyant\\" song and wrote that it is \\"pretty enough to be liked by teenage girls and danceable enough that older ladies will instantly recognize and like its vibe.\\" Dave Sholin from the Gavin Report noted it as \\"upbeat with a great hook\\" and a \\"winner\\". He added that \\"while some of her strongest hits have been ballads, it's wonderful to hear her pick up the pace on this latest endeavor.\\" Joey Guerra from Houston Chronicle wrote that it is a \\"daring, delightful track\\" that \\"takes flight on the wings of its rousing chorus and themes of unexpected love.\\"Guerra, Joey (31 May 1998). \\"Playing the dance card /Estefan should swirl to new heights with \`gloria!'\\".

Music & Media commented that with this track, Estefan \\"yet again comes up with a near- perfect pop/dance crossover hit. The song has the hook to make it a radio favourite, and a couple of snappy remixes should help broaden its appeal.\\" Vibe noted its \\"twinkly synths, romantic live strings, and vibrant house bass line\\".Flick, Larry.

The music video was directed by American film director Bille Woodruff. It was filmed in a \\"space\\" style and shows Gloria flying in some scenes. The video begins with Gloria standing alone singing in front of a magical green portal. As the chorus begins, she goes through it and ends up flying along a rotating tunnel with flashing lights. As the second verse begins, Gloria ends up in a club, amidst dancing people in several floors. Along the walls are screens with Estefan singing. She also performs choreography with some of the dancers. Towards the end, she is lifted up as she continues to sing. After she sings the last note of the song, everyone in the club claps for her. The video received the ALMA Award for \\"Best Outstanding Video\\". Two similar videos were created, one for the English version and one for the Spanish version. ==Usage in media== The song was included in the movie Dance with Me (starring Vanessa L.

Before the strike began (and perhaps while it was going on), some miners proposed sending a delegation to the capital, Bucharest, to discuss their problems with the leadership of the Romanian Communist Party, but this option was discarded as they probably thought any split to two locations would fatally undermine their cause. During the pre-strike period and just as the strike began, certain of the sectoral party chiefs who obstructed the miners' efforts were verbally and physically assaulted by the miners. Opening and first attempt at resolution Of 90,000 miners in the Jiu Valley, 35,000 decided to stop working on the evening of 1 August. Those at Lupeni were immediately joined by their fellow miners from nearby locations such as Uricani, Paro»ôeni, Aninoasa and Petrila. A list of 17 demands, approved by the strikers as a body, was drawn up by the strike leaders, Ioan Constantin (CosticƒÉ) Dobre (b. 1947) and Gheorghe Maniliuc, who were aided by Dumitru Iacob, Ion PetrilƒÉ, Dumitru Dumitra»ôcu, Mihai Slavovschi the engineer JurcƒÉ and the Amariei brothers. They requested that President Nicolae Ceau»ôescu personally come to Lupeni to receive their demands and negotiate with them. Speeches containing demands were made and the Valley was in a state of maximum tension.Mihai, \\"Greva...\\" Frightened by the events, on 2 August the authorities sent a negotiating team from Bucharest. Ilie Verde»õ (first vice- president of the Council of Ministers) and Gheorghe PanƒÉ (president of the Central Council of the General Trade Union Confederation of Romania and Minister of Labour) were both Politburo members, Verde»õ a former miner himself. Dobre, a pit brigade chief from the Paro»ôeni mine, later recalled Verde»õ's speech (attended by some 20,000 miners), in which he stated he could not decide what measures to take but was merely there to find out about the miners' problems, which only Ceau»ôescu could decide to alleviate. At this point the crowd shouted, demanding Ceau»ôescu's personal presence, whereupon Verde»õ claimed the President was occupied with \\"urgent party and state problems\\" and that if work resumed Verde»õ would \\"guarantee\\" his return to the Valley within a month with a favourable reply from Ceau»ôescu. These promises were regarded with great suspicion by the crowd, which, emboldened, began booing again and warned that they would not go back to work until Ceau»ôescu personally came and publicly promised to resolve their grievances. Booed, insulted and pelted with food scraps, Verde»õ and PanƒÉ hid behind Dobre and, backed up against the wall of the gatekeeper's booth, nervously begged him to assure their safety. Literally backed into a corner, Verde»õ promised the miners that he would convince Ceau»ôescu to come. What happened next is a matter of dispute. Dobre insists that the two party functionaries were held hostage in the booth until Ceau»ôescu's arrival, given only water and monitored in their conversations with Bucharest; other sources confirm this account.Siani,-Davies, p. 35Ramet, p. 144 Verde»õ dismissed this version as being merely a legend. In order to avoid the possibility of violent clashes, the Jiu Valley authorities infiltrated the area with informers and Securitate members, but avoided the visible imposition of martial law, also to keep tensions down. Arms depots were guarded for fear the miners might raid them. On the day of Ceau»ôescu's arrival, Securitate troops as well as party functionaries were called in from Craiova, T√¢rgu-Jiu and Deva to try to disperse the protesters.Cesereanu Ceau»ôescu speaks When the strike broke out, Ceau»ôescu and his wife Elena were on a Black Sea vacation. At Verde»õ' insistence, he hastily came to Petro»ôani on 3 August. 35,000 (some sources say 40,000) came to see him - to be sure, not all had come to hold a dialogue with him, but went out of curiosity or carried away by events, but the audience was nonetheless impressive in size. At first, despite the charged atmosphere, some shouted \\"Ceau»ôescu and the miners!\\", but others yelled \\"Lupeni '29! Lupeni '29!\\" (in reference to the Lupeni Strike of 1929, enshrined in the mythology of the Romanian Communist Party), in an effort to add legitimacy to their cause. Dobre read the list of grievances to Ceau»ôescu, presenting 26 demands related to work hours, production targets, pensions, supplies, housing and investments. They asked for a restoration of the status quo ante in social legislation, the guarantee of adequate food supplies and medical care, the establishment of workers' commissions at the enterprise level empowered to dismiss incompetent or corrupt managers, and a pledge of no reprisals against the strikers.Ramet, p. 143. After that, Dobre recalled, \\"While my name was being shouted, I turned toward Ceau»ôescu, gave him the list from which I had read and he said to me: 'Thank you for informing me, comrade'. Once in front of the microphones, Ceau»ôescu was not allowed to speak. Some were booing him, others shouted that they wouldn't go into the mine, and from afar one could hear my name. In vain the appeals for quiet with raised arms from the activists on the podium\\". A visibly shakenDobre elaborated: \\"Ceau»ôescu betrayed a visible and confused state of nervousness, worry, aggressiveness and venality. You could read on his face the shock and worry at how he had been received. I saw nothing in him of the propagandistic descriptions of a bold, courageous, dignified individual, righteous and full of humanity. From the time he appeared next to me and from the deafening and repeated cries of \\"We will not enter the mine!\\", Ceau»ôescu was wringing his hands, rocking on each foot and looking questioningly at his people, as if asking for help; he mumbled nervously, nonstop and in a soft voice. In Mihai, \\"Greva...\\" Ceau»ôescu gave a halting 5-hour (other sources say 7-hour) speech that was soon interrupted by boos. Beginning in a trembling voice, he made an initial, hopeless attempt to send the miners back to work: \\"Comrades, this is not the war‚Ä¶ this is a disgrace for the entire nation‚Ä¶ a disgrace! I have taken note of your grievances.\\" He tried to explain the party's policy and appeal to the miners through demagogy, claiming that the party leadership had wanted to reduce working hours but that the miners had resisted, which insult to their intelligence was met by cries of \\"It is not us! Bandits, thieves!\\" A general murmur of the crowd ran through the speech, along with protests and outbursts of anger; whenever Ceau»ôescu began to stumble over his words, some of the men booed and whistled. Proposing that the six-hour day be introduced gradually at Lupeni and then at the other mines, the men replied, \\"A six-hour day from tomorrow.\\" Toward the end, when, angered by their audacity, he still refused to grant an immediate six-hour workday, phrases loudly heckled included \\"He has no idea what the people's interests are\\" and \\"He is not concerned with the workers' fundamental interests\\". Starting to threaten them, Ceau»ôescu warned that \\"If you do not go back to work we'll have to stop pussyfooting around!\\"Deletant, p. 245 According to observers, \\"Down with Ceau»ôescu!\\" was then heard after prolonged booing, an account confirmed by Verde»õ. Refusing to grasp what was taking place - a break between Party and workers on a scale unprecedented in Communist Romania -, he was both shocked by his inability to connect with the workers and frightened for his physical safety (once in the workers' midst, there was little chance for law enforcement to protect him). Only when Dobre seized the microphone and urged the miners to let Ceau»ôescu finish did the atmosphere become less charged. At that point he saw that his only exit lay in making conciliatory promises he had no intention of honouring; using the wooden language that miners trust, he promised to resolve their grievances (agreeing to a six-hour workday for everyone, with Saturdays and Sundays off, and to build factories that would provide jobs for miners' wives and daughters), vowed those responsible for the miners' discontent would be brought to account and that there would be no retribution,University of Southern California School of Politics and International Relations. Studies in Comparative Communism, p. 294. 1992, Butterworth-Heinemann. and was applauded. \\"Calm down and go back to work\\", he said, after which, exhausted by the speech and the tension which made him feel insecure, he felt physically weak when leaving the platform, having to lean on one of his men. Verde»õ and PanƒÉ were released and the strike came to an end immediately after Ceau»ôescu's departure, the men dispersing and some going into the mines for the August 3 evening shift. They even offered to make up the time lost during the strike. One significant slogan used during the strike was \\"Down with the proletarian bourgeoisie\\", which was targeted against the Communist functionaries who administered the Valley and profited from the miners' labour and caused their salaries to be kept down. In using it, they attacked the perceived injustice of the hierarchical Communist system with its bureaucratic nomenklatura (which existed alongside its political and repressive sides, represented by the party and the Securitate), and invoked the Communists' decades-long struggle against the bourgeoisie in an ironic sense. To them, the regime had become a state in which capitalism continued to operate, albeit in the service of a clearly delineated group of bureaucrats. Repression The first session of the party's Central Committee after the strike took place on 4 August; it was entirely devoted to discussing the previous days' events and participants were preoccupied with finding someone to blame for what had happened. Verde»õ was named at the head of a commission which investigated the strike's causes. Ceau»ôescu pointed the finger at \\"the party personnel from the region and the Mines Directorate\\". Repression, led by Generals Emil Macri and Nicolae Ple»ôi»õƒÉ, took various forms. After Dobre spoke, the miners realised he would be targeted and so guarded his residence in order to prevent his arrest. He was not arrested on the spot; instead, the authorities busied themselves with identifying the miners: engineers and section heads were called to Securitate headquarters to identify them from pictures that had been taken secretly. All strikers who were party members were sanctioned or even removed from the party. Some of the miners were sent back to their native counties. Those who were considered to have been violent during the strike were tried and sentenced to 2‚Äì5 years' imprisonment through correctional labour for disturbing the public order and offending good morals. In practice, correctional labour meant internal deportation, although some strikers did go to prison. The miners were intimidated and attacked, along with their families in certain cases. Miners who were questioned were insistently asked never again to strike or speak out against the party. Many strikers were called to the Petro»ôani Securitate building, where they were repeatedly mistreated during interrogations by, for instance, being beaten over the head and having their fingers bound to doors. The ensuing investigation tried to discover where the core of support for the strike lay, and while some 4,000 workers were moved to other mining areas in the following months, others were said to have ended up in labour camps on the Danube-Black Sea Canal. The main strike leaders disappeared within weeks, with other outspoken miners rounded up piecemeal and dispersed over the next few months. The concessions held long enough for the authorities to break the organisational backbone of the resistance, but eventually most of these were withdrawn and the eight-hour workday imposed, though this was not made official until 1983. In the party- led meetings that followed the strike, the protesters were labelled \\"anarchist elements\\", \\"base\\" and \\"worthless people\\". At trial they were called \\"Gypsies\\", \\"lowlifes\\", \\"impostors\\" and \\"infractors\\". At least 600 miners were interrogated; 150 penal dossiers were opened; 50 were hospitalised in psychiatric wards; 15 were sentenced to correctional labour and actually imprisoned, while a further 300 or more (who were considered dangerous) were internally deported. Almost 4,000 were fired on the pretext that there was no work, or else the smallest dispute with or protest against the mine management was used to sack them. Several hundred families were moved out of the area. After prison or deportation, several former protesters continued to be harassed by the Securitate; one man, disappointed at the outcome of events, became a monk after his release from prison. The area was surrounded by security forces; two helicopters were brought in to monitor happenings and ensure a tight link with Bucharest, although the official reason for their presence was to fly mining accident victims to the hospital. The number of Securitate and Militia forces at Petro»ôani was doubled and military units were placed near all mines in the Jiu Valley. Securitate agents were hired as miners, not only to inform on other workers, but also to exert psychological pressures on them and even beat them before witnesses so as to create a climate of intimidation. A relatively large number of common criminals released from prison were brought into the mines as well. The Valley was declared a restricted area from 4 August until 1 January 1978. Strict surveillance was intended to block the flow of any information to the rest of the country or contact with the outside world, yet 22 miners acting on behalf of 800 others managed to send a letter (dated 18 September) to the French newspaper Lib√©ration, which published it on 12 October. Foreign media drew a link between Paul Goma's movement that spring and the miners' unrest several months later, though no connection actually existed.Petrescu, p. 146. ==Aftermath== The response to the unrest‚Äîgiving the appearance of acquiescing to the workers' demands and meeting local grievances, then isolating the ringleaders by sending them away or imprisoning them once the strike had ended, and reneging on concessions‚Äîestablished a model for dealing with such incidents in the future. For example, other disturbances followed in Cluj- Napoca, Turda and Ia»ôi, where students and workers in two separate protests apparently marched through the streets to party headquarters. There was a strict news blackout on such events, but it seems these were peacefully and easily defused given the non-political nature of the demands (poor factory and dormitory conditions) and their timely resolution. The Jiu Valley strike, along with the Goma episode, taught dissidents that any public deviation from the regime would not be tolerated.Roper, Steven D. Romania: The Unfinished Revolution, p. 55. Routledge, London, 2000, Gheorghe Maniliuc was imprisoned for three and a half years, and after his release died in 1987 of heart trouble. Victor Roncea, [\\"Ucis de Comisia Tismaneanu\\" (\\"Killed by the TismƒÉneanu Commission\\")], in Ziua, January 8, 2007 Dobre's fate was long a source of speculation - even the first version of the TismƒÉneanu Report claimed he had been killed,Mihai, \\"Dobre...\\" while others theorised he became a party activist, was put in a mental hospital, etc. Dobre gave an interview in 2007 in which he clarified later events. The salient points of his later life are as follows: he and his family were moved to Craiova on August 31, 1977, where they lived until May 1990, in total isolation and under constant Securitate surveillance until December 1989 (over 50 agents informed on him). He was given work as an unskilled auto mechanic and, after a calculated rejection from other universities, he attended the »òtefan Gheorghiu Academy in the 1980s but never authored Communist propaganda and showed a rebellious attitude toward the faculty. He repeatedly asked to be permitted to emigrate but was refused, and holds the Securitate responsible for the 1979 airplane crash that killed his brother, a pilot. During the Revolution, he was hailed by a crowd in Petro»ôani and appeared on television but was sidelined due to his hostility toward the National Salvation Front, being labelled an \\"extremist\\" and a \\"terrorist\\", particularly in the Craiova and Jiu Valley newspapers. In spring he moved to Bucharest, but soon the June 1990 Mineriad broke out and he barely managed to hide from a group of armed miners looking for him. He arrived with his family in London that September, seeking asylum, was sentenced in absentia by a Romanian court to five years' imprisonment in 1992, was granted asylum in 1994 and became a British citizen in 2002.Mihai, \\"Eroul...\\" ==Legacy== Ceau»ôescu, in miner's helmet, on a return visit to Lupeni in November 1977. Dobre sees the strike as a \\"prelude\\" to the events of December 1989. To be sure, the movement helped break down the myth of unity between the Communist Party and the working class, something that Solidarity would continue in Poland a few years later. In a country labouring under hardline Communism, the strike offered a brief opportunity for an exercise in democracy: for almost three days, miners demanded and protested before a microphone; they spoke freely, none were excluded and no censorship was imposed. Those investigating the miners who had been arrested perceived the strike as an \\"uprising\\", frequently using this term during interrogations. This term had significant implications as the miners were part of a social class until then supposed to be an ally of the party, and the apparent break with workers frightened the leadership boded ill for the regime, which could depend even less upon the peasants (then being forced into agricultural cooperatives) or the intellectual √©lite (part of which at the time was chafing under the rise of Protochronism heralded six years earlier by the July Theses). Ceau»ôescu himself appeared stricken; as his near-fainting episode indicates, he was not prepared for the outbreak of dissent and had seen that the regime was not as stable as he might have believed. It was, Verde»õ said, \\"the first self-abasement of Ceau»ôescu's political career.\\" The strike‚Äîprobably the first workers' protest since 1958, with the exception of a September 1972 strike in the Jiu ValleyPetrescu, p. 146, 155.‚Äîbegan not as an anti-Communist or even an anti-Ceau»ôescu movement but rather a socio-economic one in spontaneous reaction to the new pensions law, as confirmed by the miners' inexperience, which led them to improvisation and hasty decision- making. However, once the Communist leaders were sequestered, it moved in a political direction and, given the repression that followed, was interpreted as such by the authorities. At the same time, the strike did have an intrinsically political character in the sense that the miners‚Äîthought of as essential components of the Communist working class‚Äîrevolted against their ideological bosses and conditions created by the very political system that used them as part of its labour force. So while collective and unpremeditated, the protest challenged the Communist leadership of the day and ultimately the regime itself. Just how significant the strike's implications were becomes apparent when considering the miner's place in Communist myth-making: he represented an \\"archetypal proletarian\\", a \\"new man\\" whose symbolic aura was conferred by his Stakhanovite determination. The idea of the new man particularly caught on in areas dominated by a single industry, like the Jiu Valley, where the working masses could easily be controlled by the party. The uneducated miners, drawn largely from poor rural or socially disadvantaged layers of society, believed in the Communist ideology and discourse, which rang true to them, and awaited the arrival of a classless society. The miserable conditions in which they actually lived did not match the propaganda, and the disillusioned miners responded forcefully. After the strike, Ceau»ôescu took to posing as an \\"honorary miner\\" or as a national leader flanked by Securitate members dressed up as miners. He had been genuinely shocked that the representatives par excellence of the new man had unexpectedly revolted against the system that had so carefully crafted them. The image of the model miner had come crashing down, and for that reason the strikers were terrorized‚Äîthey had destroyed a myth that had served not only them and other \\"new men\\", but also Ceau»ôescu himself. ==FootnotesReferences== * Ruxandra Cesereanu, \\"Greva minerilor din Valea Jiului, 1977\\" (\\"The Jiu Valley Miners' Strike, 1977\\"), in Revista 22, Nr.752, August 2004 * Deletant, Dennis, Ceau»ôescu and the Securitate: Coercion and Dissent in Romania, 1965-1989, M.E.

It is found in the Amazon rainforest and montane forests in the eastern piedmont, in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador (Morona Santiago, Napo, Orellana, Pastaza, and Sucumb√≠os provinces), French Guiana, Guyana, Peru, Suriname, and Venezuela. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests, intermittent freshwater marshes, and heavily degraded former forest. \\"Marmoratus\\" in Latin means \\"marble,\\" perhaps referring to the dorsal coloring pattern. It is threatened by habitat loss. ==Identification== Coloration It is a medium frog of bronco color with dark mottled brown, green or reddish, English and yellow-orange finger membranes and white belly with black dots. None of the species near Dendropsophus marmoratus has this pattern of coloration, which makes it clearly distinguishable from other sympatric species. Size The snout‚Äìvent length in males averages 35.8 mm (range 29.8‚Äì41.5; n = 19), and in females the average is 47.7 mm (range 46.5‚Äì49.7; n = 5). Description The following description is based on Duellman. The snout is round in dorsal and profile view. eardrum present. The outer finger of the hand has a membrane to the base of the disc; the other manual fingers have membranes along about 2/3 of their length. The toes also have membranes at the base of the discs . Males in reproduction lack cornified nuptial excrescences . Scalloped skin folds are present on the outer edges of the feet, forearms and hands. The skin on the back is weakly tuberculated and that of the belly is granular. Color in life The back varies from greyish-bronze to greenish-bronze and has a black, dark brown, or reddish mottle that generally includes dorsolaterally olive-green areas. In most individuals, there are pairs of large brown or reddish scapular marks. The armpit, groin, and posterior surface of the thighs are yellow-orange with black spots or mottled on the thighs. The anterior surfaces of the thighs are pale yellow-green with black dots. The chin and belly are white or light yellow with black dots; the ventral surfaces of the limbs are dark gray to black. The membranes are orange distally and black proximally. The iris is pale gray with fine black crosslinks. ==Habitat and Biology== Dendropsophus marmoratus is an arboreal inhabitant of the forest, but individuals migrate to breeding sites in open areas. About two-thirds of the individuals registered in Santa Cecilia (Sucumb√≠os Province, Ecuador) were near temporary pools and ditches filled with water in clearings near the forest. A minority were in tree branches in secondary forest and primary forest. On Lago Agrio, frogs were recorded on tree branches felled in primary forest. Many of the frogs had been at heights of more than 20 m. In Yasuni National Park, Ron recorded it in open areas and Read (notes from the field) found choirs of Dendropsophus marmoratusin recently created temporary pools along roads in primary and secondary forest; It was especially common in large clearings within primary forest, such as oil well platforms, where water was present. Scinax ruber males also sing in their choirs. D. marmoratus is found at altitudes from 0 to 1000 m above sea level in the Amazon Basin in Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia; the south of Venezuela; the Guyanas. Gomes and Peixoto gave a record for Mato Grosso, Brazil and commented on the Brazilian component of the distribution. The first record in Bolivia is given by K√∂hler. ==Taxonomy and Evolutionary Relationships== Part of the Dendropsophus marmoratus group. The group has eight species of which only Dendropsophus marmoratus is in Ecuador. The phylogeny presented by Wiens et al. supports the monophilia of the group but, its analysis and Faivovich analysis only included two species. Faivovich et al. suggested as a possible character shared by the group (synapomorphy) the presence of tuberculated skin on the margin of the lower lip. See synopsis of Bokermann. ==Additional Information== Duellman described the tadpole and provided data on morphology, occurrence, natural history, vocalization and diet in Santa Cecilia, Ecuador. Natural history data of the Amazonian Cusco Peru, are presented by Duellman. Lescure and Marty provided a brief synopsis and photo in French Guiana. Beetles and orthoptera are the most abundant prey while Men√©ndez-Guerrero reports that the diet has a high frequency of ants and attributes this fact to its morphology characterized by short jaws and thin head compared to others hybrids Lee and Crump demonstrate selection of partners in relation to size since males in bridal embrace (amplexus) were on average larger than males who were not in amplexus. ==References== * *Men√©ndez-Guerrero, P. 2001.

The body is elongate with an angular snout. The dorsum has light orange background with a dark stripe running over the canthus rostralis and disappearing on the sides of the body. There is also a pair of similar, dark lines beginning on the interocular region. The dorsal pattern is occasionally absent or include an additional pair of dark lines over the sacrum, or dark dots and fragments. The underside is immaculate. ==Habitat and conservation== This species is found on vegetation near ponds and other standing bodies of water in a range of habitats: forests, open areas, and cities. Breeding takes place in temporary ponds.

It is found in western Colombia, Costa Rica, Nicaragua and Panama. Its natural habitats are tropical moist lowland forests, but it may also occur in disturbed habitats. It is threatened by habitat loss. ==Description== The San Carlos treefrog is a small, sturdy species with the female growing to a snout‚Äìvent length of while the males are slightly smaller. This frog has a blunt snout and a wide head and the tympanum is partially concealed by a fold of skin. There is a single vocal sac in the throat and a pair of vocal slits. The fore-legs are short and the long, slender fingers have large flattened pads at the tips. The hind legs are short but powerful and the long toes are partially webbed and have expanded tips. The skin on the dorsal surface is smooth and has a pale brown colour with slight darker patterning. The ventral surface is granular and white, blending to cream and yellow on the inside of the thighs. The iris is yellowish-bronze and during the breeding season, the male's vocal sac is yellow. ==Distribution and habitat== The San Carlos treefrog is a nocturnal, lowland species found on Pacific northwestern Colombia (Choc√≥ and Risaralda Departments) and Panama, as well as on the Atlantic slopes of Panama, Costa Rica, and Nicaragua. Its natural habitat is humid forest where it breeds in shallow pools. It does not generally occur at greater elevations than above sea level. It is also often found in cultivated land, swampy meadows, and drainage ditches. ==Biology== The San Carlos treefrog is a generalist predator feeding on small terrestrial invertebrates such as spiders, moth larvae and fly larvae. It is an \\"explosive breeder\\", the main reproductive period starting with the arrival of the rainy season. The males are stimulated by heavy rain to congregate, calling from low vegetation beside temporary pools or flooded fields. Many males may synchronise their calls and in Panama, this species is often joined by Dendropsophus microcephalus and Dendropsophus ebraccatus in a joint chorus. The eggs are laid in clusters of about four hundred eggs and deposited among plants growing in shallow water. ==Status== The San Carlos treefrog is listed as being of \\"least concern\\" in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. It is considered to have a stable population, is common over a wide range and is relatively adaptable. Its greatest threat may be pollution of the waters in which it breeds. == References == phlebodes Category:Amphibians of Colombia Category:Amphibians of Costa Rica Category:Amphibians of Nicaragua Category:Amphibians of Panama Category:Amphibians described in 1906 Category:Taxa named by Leonhard Stejneger Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Dendropsophus phlebodes"},{"id":"12372270","text":"A previously unknown Inca settlement, Quriwayrachina or Quri Wayrachina (Quechua quri gold, wayrachina a special oven for smelting metal, \\"oven for smelting gold\\"),Ricardo N.

It is the final poem of the Rival Poet group of the Fair Youth sonnets in which Shakespeare writes about an unnamed young man and a rival poet competing for the youth's favor. The exact date of its composition is unknown, it has been suggested that the Rival Poet series may have been written between 1598 and 1600. Sonnet 86 has attracted attention because it seems to offer clues to the identity of the Rival Poet. ==Exegesis== Sonnet 86 is one last attempt by the poet to explain why he has been struck silent, and how words seem useless when silence is the only decent expression. The sonnet describes in backwards motion the progress of his own anguish: In the first quatrain the poet in him is entombed, as the attempt and failure of the poet's writing process is described with a metaphor of a pregnancy and miscarriage (line 3). In the second quatrain the poet is struck dead, in the third he becomes sick. Running alongside of this, but in forward motion, there is a progressive derogation of the rival poet, a progress that starts high with the magnificent nautical metaphor of line one.Shakespeare, William. Duncan-Jones, Katherine. Shakespeare‚Äôs Sonnets. Bloomsbury Arden 2010. p. 280 .Hammond, Gerald. The Reader and the Young Man Sonnets. Barnes & Noble. 1981. p. 107. The sonnet's imagery of sea going vessels (\\"proud full sail\\") recalls the mighty galleons of the Spanish Armada that fought the British fleet of smaller, more nimble ships. The image of a galleon at full sail sailing in the direction of some treasure, invites admiration for the strength of the rival's poetry, and for the size of his ambition. This image is diminished in the second quatrain, when it is suggested that the rival is merely co-author along with his \\"compeers\\", and it is diminished further in the third quatrain when the rival is shown to be duped (\\"which nightly gulls him\\") by those \\"spirits\\".Shakespeare, William. Duncan-Jones, Katherine. Shakespeare‚Äôs Sonnets. Bloomsbury Arden 2010. p. 280 .Hammond, Gerald. The Reader and the Young Man Sonnets. Barnes & Noble. 1981. p. 107. The sonnet begins with the speaker asking whether it was the \\"great verse\\" of his rival poet that had prevented the speaker from expressing his own \\"ripe thoughts.\\" According to Duncan-Jones, \\"As in the final line of the preceding sonnet, the speaker claims to be unable to voice his thoughts of love: they are ready for utterance (ripe), but remain buried (in-hearsed) in his brain because [the speaker's question proposes] he is intimidated by his rival.\\" Harold Bloom considers this intimidation is not caused by the artistic skill of his rival. In the opening lines of the sonnet, \\"[Shakespeare] charmingly suggests an inhibition through jealousy, not of superior poetic powers, but of encountering the Fair Young Man's portrait in a rival's verses.\\" Kenneth Muir writes: \\"Whether ‚Äòthe proud full sail of his great verse‚Äô is sincere admiration [by the speaker of the sonnet] or a hint that [the rival's verse] is bombastic is still debated.\\" In the eighth line (\\"Giving him aid, my verse astonished\\") the word \\"astonished\\" is used with an earlier definition: \\"bereft of sensation; stunned, benumbed,\\" in describing the speaker's verse. The final line of the third quatrain (\\"I was not sick of any fear from thence\\") sets the stage for the couplet, and alludes to the fact that, while his fear did not come from \\"thence\\" (the rival poet), there is a fear that has silenced his writing. The couplet returns to a primary theme of the entire Rival Poet group: that the young man is the only source of inspiration and the only proper subject. The couplet shows two extremes of response that the young man and his desire for flattery causes in his poets: the over-inflated verse of the rival and the silence of the speaker.Shakespeare, William. Duncan-Jones, Katherine. Shakespeare‚Äôs Sonnets. Bloomsbury Arden 2010. p. 280 .Booth, Stephen, ed. Shakespeare's Sonnets (Rev. ed.). New Haven: Yale Nota Bene. (2000) p. 283Hammond, Gerald. The Reader and the Young Man Sonnets. Barnes & Noble. 1981. p. 107. Sonnet 86 is expressed in the past tense, suggesting the end of the Rival Poets group, and a look back. The speaker indicates that his silence was not caused by the Rival Poet, but at his rival's \\"appropriation of the young man's favour\\" (line 13 and 14). ==Structure== The word sonnet ultimately derives from the Latin word for sound (sonus), and from the Old Occitan word for song (sonet). In 1573, George Gascoigne established an important definition of the English Sonnet: > I can best allowe to call those Sonnets which are of fourtene lynes, every > line conteyning tenne syllables. The first twelve do ryme in staves of foure > lines by crosse metre, and the last twoo ryming together do conclude the > whole. Sonnet 86 is an English or Shakespearean sonnet, which has three quatrains, followed by a final rhyming couplet. It follows the rhyme scheme, ' and is composed in iambic pentameter, a metre of five feet per line, with two syllables in each foot accented weak/strong. It follows the English Sonnet form described by Gascoigne. However it follows the earlier Petrarchan model in one way ‚Äî by placing the volta at the start of line nine. Most of the lines are examples of regular iambic pentameter, including the 6th line: √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / Above a mortal pitch, that struck me dead? (86.6) :/ = ictus, a metrically strong syllabic position. √ó = nonictus. Line two contains the first of a few possible reversals of the accent in first foot: / √ó √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / Bound for the prize of all-too-precious you, (86.2) Reversals also occur at the start of lines four and eight. Possible reversals occur at the start of lines one, five, seven, nine, and twelve; while possible reversals occur in the middle of lines three, seven, and thirteen. The meter calls for the word \\"spirit\\" in line five to be pronounced with one syllable,Booth 2000, p. 262. while the word \\"spirits\\" has two.Booth 2000, pp.288-89. Line eight's \\"astonish√®d\\" is pronounced with four syllables.Booth 2000, p. 289. ==Possible clues to the identity of the rival poet== It is not known who the rival poet is. Nearly every well-known poet contemporary with Shakespeare has been suggested, including George Chapman, Christopher Marlowe, Samuel Daniel, Michael Drayton, Barnabe Barnes, Gervase Markham,Halliday, pp. 52, 127, 141-2, 303, 463. and Richard BarnfieldLeo Daugherty, William Shakespeare, Richard Barnfield, and the Sixth Earl of Derby, Cambria Press, 2010 The second and third quatrains have garnered attention as possibly containing clues to the identity of the rival poet. The description of a poet \\"by spirits taught to write\\" (line 5) has led some to name George Chapman as candidate, due to Chapman's supposed spiritual inspiration by the ghost of Homer. The phrase \\"Above a mortal pitch, that struck me dead\\" (line 6) has suggested to some Christopher Marlowe (who died in 1593) and his play Tamburlaine the Great. Shakespearean scholar Eric Sams considers the descriptions of spiritual communication in the second quatrain (\\"spirits taught to write\\") to perhaps suggest Barnabe Barnes as the Rival Poet, noting Barnes' interest in occultism in 16th century England. In the third quatrain, lines nine and ten are seen to reference a specific poet. Of the \\"affable familiar ghost\\" found in line nine, Duncan-Jones writes: \\"The phrase seems to carry an allusion to some well-known relationship between a poet and his Muse or inspiring genius, such as Chapman's with the spirit of Homer.\\" Regarding the Rival Poet's identity, Sams reads the first line of the couplet (line 13) as a possible reference to Barnes's 1593 work Parthenophil and Parthenophe: :One phrase in Sonnet 86 echoes Barnes, namely \\"when your countenance filled up his line.\\" Barnes's sonnet to Southampton includes the actual words \\"your countenance.\\" Thus Southampton's favour is solicited for the love‚àílyrics of Parthenophil and Parthenophe, so \\"that with your countenance graced they may withstand\\" envy and criticism. The word \\"countenance\\" has indeed \\"filled up\\" Barnes's line‚Äîto overflowing, since it adds an extra syllable. ==ReferencesFurther reading== Category:British poems Category:Sonnets by William Shakespeare ","title":"Sonnet 86"},{"id":"12372302","text":"Dendropsophus robertmertensi (vernacular name: Mertens' yellow treefrog) is a species of frog in the family Hylidae.

The tadpoles have dangling oral discs by which they can attach themselves to the substrate. ==Status== The total area of occupancy of the Chamula mountain brook frog is less than and it is only known from five locations. The montane cloud forests where it lives are under threat from human activities, and although this is quite a common species where it is found, populations of these frogs are thought to be declining.

The male has a rounded snout when seen from above and a squarish snout when seen from the side. The nostrils are protuberant, the eyes have golden irises and the tympani are oval. The limbs are fairly robust and the toes are partially webbed. The colouring is rather variable, with the dorsal surface mostly green and the ventral surface yellowish. The front and back of the thighs as well as parts of the shin and hind toes are some shade of red or orange-red. This frog was first described by the American herpetologist William E. Duellman in 1961 and at that time he had not been able to find and describe a female. ==Ecology== This frog lives in cloud forests and requires moist conditions. Breeding occurs mainly in the summer but may take place throughout the year. The male calls from low vegetation near pools and streams. The call consists of from three to thirteen low notes, each lasting for 0.08 seconds and changing frequency in the middle, and sounding like \\"raa-raa-raa\\". The tadpoles develop in streams and cling onto rocks and stones with their mouthparts to avoid being swept away. ==Status== The Sierra Juarez brook frog has a limited range in the Sierra Ju√°rez Mountains in the state of Oaxaca in southeastern Mexico, where it is present at altitudes between . The chief threats it faces are from degradation of its cloud forest habitat by human actions. Some of the tadpoles were found to have keratinised mouthparts, which is likely to indicate infection with the chytridiomycosis fungus, and this may also be a threat for this uncommon species.

It is a tree, sometimes growing to more than with a trunk covered with thick, white, papery bark and weeping thinner branches. It has a long flowering season, can flower at almost any time of the year and is often grown as a tree in parks and on roadsides. It was the first melaleuca to be described and was described from a specimen growing in Indonesia. ==Description== Melaleuca leucadendra is a large tree, usually less than, but sometimes more than tall. Its thick bark is papery, usually white but also pinkish or cream and it has weeping branches. Its leaves and young branches are covered with fine, short, white hairs when young but become glabrous as they mature. The leaves are arranged alternately, long, wide, flat, narrow egg-shaped or lance-shaped and tapering to a point. The leaves have 5 (sometimes as many as 9) longitudinal veins and are often curved or sickle- shaped. The flowers are cream, white or greenish-white and are arranged in spikes on the ends of branches which continue to grow after flowering, sometimes on the sides of branches or in the upper leaf axils. Each spike is up to in diameter, up to long and contains between 7 and 22 groups of flowers in threes. The petals are wide and fall off soon after the flower opens. The stamens are arranged in five bundles around the flower and each bundle contains 5 to 12 stamens. Flowering can occur at any time of the year and is followed by fruit which are woody capsules, long in loose clusters along the stems. M. leucadendra flowers ‚Äì Mount Archer National Park M. leucadendra foliage ‚Äì Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney M. leucadendra fruit ‚Äì Cairns airport 19th century illustration of M. leucadendra ==Taxonomy and naming== Melaleuca leucadendra was first formally described in 1762 by Carl Linnaeus in Species Plantarum as Myrtus leucadendra. Linnaeus used a description of the species written by Georg Eberhard Rumphius in 1741, before the modern system of classification was devised by Linnaeus. Rumphius had described a plant growing in what is now Indonesia. Later, Linnaeus realised that this species had little in common with other species in the genus Myrtus and described the genus Melaleuca to accommodate this species. Thus, Melaleuca leucadendra became the first melaleuca to be formally described. The description was published in 1767 in Mantissa plantarum. It follows that although nearly all melaeucas are found only in Australia, the first type specimen was from Indonesia. The specific epithet (leucadendra) is derived from the Ancient Greek words ŒªŒµœÖŒ∫œåœÇ (leuk√≥s) meaning ‚Äúwhite‚Äù and Œ¥Œ≠ŒΩŒ¥œÅŒøŒΩ (d√©ndron) meaning ‚Äútree‚Äù referring to the white bark of this plant. Melaleuca leucadendra is superficially similar to other paperbark trees, especially Melaleuca cajuputi, Melaleuca quinquenervia, Melaleuca linariifolia and Melaleuca viridiflora and all are sometimes referred to as cajuput or cajeput. Cajuput is an English word for the oil obtained from the foliage of Melaleuca cajuputi and the word is possibly a corruption of kayu putih, the Indonesian name for the tree. The Malay name for the paperbark tree is gelam and may have given its name to the Kampong Glam district in Singapore. ==Distribution and habitat== This melaleuca is widely distributed in northern parts of Western Australia, the Northern Territory and in Queensland as far south as Shoalwater Bay. It also occurs in New Guinea and Indonesia. It grows in forests near the edges of rivers and streams on a range of soils. ==Uses== Traditional uses Aboriginal people used strips of bark from this tree and tied them to a frame of Dodonaea branches to build huts that were waterproof. The bark was used to wrap food before cooking in an underground oven called a kap mari. It was also used to wrap the bodies of their dead. The bark from trunks of very large trees was used to make bark canoes. The crushed leaves were used to treat respiratory infections and the flowers for making a sweet drink. Horticulture This species of melaleuca is often grown in parks and as a street tree in tropical and sub-tropical areas like Brisbane and as far south as Sydney. It prefers a sunny location but will tolerate poor, waterlogged soils. It has also been used as a street tree in Hong Kong. Essential oils A range of essential oils can be distilled from this species, depending on where the trees occur. Two of the most common chemotypes are based on methyl eugenol and E-methyl isoeugenol. Timber The timber from M. leucadendra can be used for general construction. In Vietnam, it is used for poles, piles and woodchips. ==References== leucadendra Category:Trees of Australia Category:Myrtales of Australia Category:Flora of the Northern Territory Category:Flora of Queensland Category:Flora of Western Australia Category:Flora of New Guinea Category:Garden plants of Australia Category:Drought-tolerant trees Category:Ornamental trees Category:Plants described in 1762 Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus ","title":"Melaleuca leucadendra"},{"id":"12372412","text":"Angioid streaks, also called Knapp streaks or Knapp striae are small breaks in Bruch's membrane, an elastic tissue containing membrane of the retina that may become calcified and crack.DermAtlas - Johns Hopkins Up to 50% of angioid streak cases are idiopathic. It may occur secondary to blunt trauma, or it may be associated with many systemic diseases. The condition is usually asymptomatic, but decrease in vision may occur due to choroidal neovascularization. ==Clinical features== Angioid streaks are often associated with pseudoxanthoma elasticum, but have been found to occur in conjunction with other disorders, including Paget's disease, sickle cell disease and Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. These streaks can have a negative impact on vision due to choroidal neovascularization or choroidal rupture. Also, vision can be impaired if the streaks progress to the fovea and damage the retinal pigment epithelium. ==Signs== Retinal fundus examination may reveal grey or dark red spoke like lesions around optic disk and radiating outward from peripapillary area. Peau d'orange (orange skin), also known as leopard skin pattern may be seen in association with pseudoxanthoma elasticum. Optic disc drusen may also seen. ==Diagnosis== The diagnosis is mainly clinical, however fundus fluorescein angiography shows that the streaks appear hyperfluorescent (window defect) in the early phase. Indocyanine green angiography can also be used for diagnosing angioid streaks and their associated ocular pathologies. ==Management== Management of angioid streaks starts with complete medical checkup to rule out underlying systemic associations. The condition is usually asymptomatic and at first do not need any treatment. Secondary ocular complications like choroidal neovascularization lead to vision loss, and/or metamorphopsia. If choroidal neovascularization is present, treatment options like anti-VEGF medication, laser photocoagulation, photodynamic therapy, transpupillary thermotherapy, macular translocation surgery etc. may be needed. ==History== They were first described by Robert Walter Doyne in 1889 in a patient with retinal hemorrhages. In 1892, ophthalmologist Hermann Jakob Knapp called them \\"angioid streaks\\" because of their resemblance to blood vessels. From histopathological research in the 1930s, they were discovered to be caused by changes at the level of Bruch's membrane. Presently, it is believed that its pathology may be a combination of elastic degeneration of Bruch's membrane, iron deposition in elastic fibers from hemolysis with secondary mineralization, and impaired nutrition due to stasis and small vessel occlusion. ==External links== * eMedicine article on Angioid streaks * Photos of Angioid streaks == References == Angioid streaks ","title":"Angioid streaks"}]`),R={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:P}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},I={class:"card-container"};function H(s,a,n,c,u,i){const m=y("PoemCard");return t(),o(h,null,[a[1]||(a[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâLife Quotesü•≥")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",I,[(t(!0),o(h,null,p(i.visiblePoems,(r,g)=>(t(),b(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:a[0]||(a[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):w("",!0)])],64)}const x=d(R,[["render",H]]),F=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotesmag/46.md","filePath":"quotesmag/46.md"}'),D={name:"quotesmag/46.md"},L=Object.assign(D,{setup(s){return(a,n)=>(t(),o("div",null,[v(x)]))}});export{F as __pageData,L as default};
